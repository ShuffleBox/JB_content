WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.140
I think PipeWire just landed the killer feature

00:02.140 --> 00:04.400
that's gonna make every desktop Linux user

00:04.400 --> 00:06.440
want to transition to PipeWire.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.360
What is it?

00:07.360 --> 00:11.880
In version 0.3.25, you can now use your phone

00:11.880 --> 00:16.280
as a microphone to your Linux box through Bluetooth.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.120
What?

00:17.120 --> 00:18.200
Yeah, and that's an awesome feature.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.920
I think that's something we need to try.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.320
It makes it now possible to use A2DP

00:22.320 --> 00:23.960
as a source input device.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.820
So you can then use your phone as an A2DP microphone.

00:27.820 --> 00:30.040
And you know, Wes, like some of these phones actually

00:30.040 --> 00:31.540
have decent microphones on them.

00:31.540 --> 00:33.440
This could be like a seriously great way

00:33.440 --> 00:36.040
to get audio from a guest or somebody.

00:36.040 --> 00:38.680
You're just tired of dragging that remote mic around.

00:38.680 --> 00:39.520
Yeah.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.200
Or just, you think Joe will let us get away

00:41.200 --> 00:43.760
with using our phones for doing the show?

00:43.760 --> 00:45.760
I think we better try without telling him.

00:45.760 --> 00:55.760
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

00:55.760 --> 00:56.680
My name is Chris.

00:56.680 --> 00:57.760
My name is Wes.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.200
Hello, Wes.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.760
And can I just say, your new 400 after-party face

01:02.760 --> 01:06.080
tat you got is, well, it's going to heal real soon.

01:06.080 --> 01:07.280
Aw, thank you.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.520
But you know, you still owe me.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.920
You said you'd paid for it if I got the show's logo on my face.

01:11.920 --> 01:12.420
Right.

01:12.420 --> 01:13.420
Yeah, we'll get to that.

01:13.420 --> 01:15.460
But first, I want to thank ACG for sponsoring

01:15.460 --> 01:18.600
this episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.240
They are the leader in learning for Cloud, Linux,

01:21.240 --> 01:22.480
and other modern tech skills.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.840
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs,

01:24.840 --> 01:29.520
get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

01:29.520 --> 01:30.980
Well, coming up on the show today,

01:30.980 --> 01:33.920
it's the show that wasn't supposed to be.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.400
We were going to take the week off.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.200
And we thought about it a little bit.

01:38.200 --> 01:41.920
We thought, well, actually, there's a lot to catch up on.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.280
We have a lot that we want to cover.

01:44.280 --> 01:47.400
There's things from 400 we still have to talk about.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.540
And so we're going to kind of have the no-show.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.600
It's like a no-show this week.

01:52.600 --> 01:55.840
From the wackos that brought you running arch on their server,

01:55.840 --> 01:59.200
we're going to talk about hosting your own email server.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.400
This is another one of those don't do

02:01.400 --> 02:06.360
as we do kind of episodes, unless you really want to.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.400
We're going to cover some server basics, what

02:08.400 --> 02:10.760
you need to be aware of, and how we're

02:10.760 --> 02:12.680
going to try to make it all work smooth for us

02:12.680 --> 02:14.180
and what our use case is going to be

02:14.180 --> 02:17.680
for self-hosting our own email.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.640
But we'll get to all of that.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.440
There's a lot to take in there.

02:22.440 --> 02:25.280
The truth of the matter is we just have a lot going on.

02:25.280 --> 02:28.260
We wanted to do something kind of fun with you guys this week.

02:28.260 --> 02:30.960
And we'll take time off in the near future.

02:30.960 --> 02:33.760
We'll take a week off, because we do have a great interview

02:33.760 --> 02:37.280
all about an individual who didn't know anything

02:37.280 --> 02:40.900
about construction, didn't know anything about diesel engines,

02:40.900 --> 02:42.280
didn't know anything about Linux,

02:42.280 --> 02:44.080
didn't know anything about automation.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.000
And he went out and bought himself a school bus

02:47.000 --> 02:50.600
and rebuilt it from the ground up as a mobile home

02:50.600 --> 02:53.680
that he works from with his family on the road,

02:53.680 --> 02:56.480
all powered by Linux, using automation

02:56.480 --> 02:59.320
to manage the tanks and the batteries and all of it.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.560
And so it's a great conversation.

03:01.560 --> 03:04.560
If you want inspiration or just a little,

03:04.560 --> 03:06.880
you can get your project done, that's

03:06.880 --> 03:08.120
the interview right there.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.480
Yeah, it's so inspiring how somebody

03:10.480 --> 03:12.800
who didn't know something just decided, so what?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.040
I'm just going to go learn it.

03:14.040 --> 03:17.320
And he just, at every turn, he had to just go learn something.

03:17.320 --> 03:20.520
And even when it came to setting up a Linux server,

03:20.520 --> 03:21.400
he didn't sway.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.680
He just said, you know what?

03:22.680 --> 03:23.440
I've gotten this far.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.320
I'm going to learn it.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.960
So we will run that story in the future.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.880
It just today didn't feel like the right time,

03:29.880 --> 03:31.960
because we had a lot we want to do.

03:31.960 --> 03:35.960
And we just had an episode that was honestly a little off topic.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.760
So today, we're just going to have some fun.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.140
So before we go any further, let's

03:39.140 --> 03:41.920
bring in our virtual lug, time-appropriate greetings,

03:41.920 --> 03:42.400
Mumble Room.

03:42.400 --> 03:42.900
Hello.

03:42.900 --> 03:43.400
Hello.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.080
It's Tuesday.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.760
Why are there 25 of you here?

03:47.760 --> 03:49.160
We told you for two weeks in a row

03:49.160 --> 03:50.240
we weren't doing a show today.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.960
I don't know if they weren't listening,

03:51.960 --> 03:53.920
or they were listening when we said we were

03:53.920 --> 03:56.560
going to do a show like today.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.320
I think everyone's still drunk on beer from episode 400.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.160
That's what I think.

04:00.160 --> 04:00.660
I am.

04:00.660 --> 04:01.160
Yeah.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.960
You know.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.440
Speaking of episode 400, the votes are in.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.080
Our special 400 brew was named by the community.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.960
It's officially named the See You Next Tuesday beer.

04:11.960 --> 04:12.960
The See You Next Tuesday.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.000
And I'm drinking a little Tuesday right now, Wes,

04:15.000 --> 04:15.640
let me tell you.

04:15.640 --> 04:17.880
Oh, you got things plumbed up again, huh?

04:17.880 --> 04:21.080
Drinking in my beer stein, too, Wes, in my brand new 400 beer

04:21.080 --> 04:21.560
stein.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.480
If you ordered them early, they were already starting to arrive.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.520
Oh, that's great.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.720
It's actually pretty special, in a way.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.600
You know, I mean, I'm sitting here in my studio

04:29.600 --> 04:33.320
drinking a Linux-unplugged beer in a Linux-unplugged beer

04:33.320 --> 04:33.840
stein.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.720
Talk about self-hosting, right?

04:35.720 --> 04:37.320
Right, and we're doing an episode

04:37.320 --> 04:38.200
because we just wanted to.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.320
We could have taken the week off.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.000
We said we were going to, but we just kind of wanted to.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.800
So yeah, the beer steins are shipping,

04:43.800 --> 04:45.080
which is really great.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.800
Yours is here, Wes, waiting for you.

04:46.800 --> 04:47.600
Oh, great.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.360
I've been jealous.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.800
I mean, I've already seen a few community members posting

04:50.800 --> 04:53.560
theirs on Telegram or on the matrix server, which

04:53.560 --> 04:54.080
is awesome.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.400
Please keep doing that.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.440
They look good in your hands out there.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.120
That's true.

04:58.120 --> 05:01.000
I do love seeing that, and I think they do look good.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.840
I'm really happy with how they turned out,

05:02.840 --> 05:04.800
and I'm glad that they're shipping right away

05:04.800 --> 05:06.680
because Coda Radio listeners will

05:06.680 --> 05:09.240
know that I recently had my butt kicked by a robe.

05:09.240 --> 05:15.880
I was schooled by a robe and didn't like that very much.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.240
It's been a minute, Wes, since I really was schooled.

05:19.240 --> 05:21.120
I went to the hard knocks of business school

05:21.120 --> 05:23.000
for a couple of weeks.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.400
I think we might need a sandboard clip for that one.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.200
Really?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.360
It was bad.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.120
But I did learn some fundamental lessons, I'll say that.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.440
I just learned them the really, really hard way.

05:32.440 --> 05:34.320
And so towards the end of the show today,

05:34.320 --> 05:38.360
after we get through the news and the email server stuff,

05:38.360 --> 05:42.000
I'm going to share some very new and first steps

05:42.000 --> 05:45.960
that I'm taking to grow Jupiter Broadcasting as a business.

05:45.960 --> 05:49.080
It's kind of been just about a year-ish

05:49.080 --> 05:51.600
since the plans to go independent were

05:51.600 --> 05:54.640
beginning and the thought and the process was starting.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.880
And so I want to do a bit of an update for you all

05:57.880 --> 05:59.400
and share that with you.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.120
We have a couple of big updates there and some lessons

06:02.120 --> 06:04.160
I've learned, some humble pie that I have to eat,

06:04.160 --> 06:05.400
and all of that.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.800
But we'll get there.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.280
But first, let's do some business

06:08.280 --> 06:10.840
and let's get to the community news

06:10.840 --> 06:14.520
because we have an update from Google.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.040
It seems Google has become concerned

06:16.040 --> 06:18.560
about the correctness of code, as they put it

06:18.560 --> 06:20.040
in the Android platform.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.440
And they say, correctness of code

06:21.440 --> 06:24.200
is a top priority for the security, stability,

06:24.200 --> 06:27.120
and quality of each Android release.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.720
Unfortunately, memory safety bugs in C and C++

06:30.720 --> 06:32.960
continue to be their most difficult to address

06:32.960 --> 06:37.840
source of, quote, incorrectness, not bugs.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.620
Here we're talking about the Android underpinnings,

06:40.620 --> 06:43.200
not like the Java or Kotlin or whatever

06:43.200 --> 06:45.240
framework you're using to develop your Android apps,

06:45.240 --> 06:48.120
but all the stuff that runs at the lower levels.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.400
And we should probably give them credit because, I mean,

06:50.400 --> 06:52.560
Google and Android developers more widely

06:52.560 --> 06:56.400
do invest a lot of effort and resources trying to detect,

06:56.400 --> 07:00.280
trying to fix, or just mitigate this type of bug upfront.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.680
And those efforts are pretty effective.

07:02.680 --> 07:06.380
I mean, yes, bugs get through, but a large number of bugs

07:06.380 --> 07:09.200
are prevented from ever making it into an actual Android

07:09.200 --> 07:09.840
release.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.360
And then from me complaining about it on air.

07:12.360 --> 07:16.380
But memory safety issues are still a big contributor,

07:16.380 --> 07:17.600
even given all of that.

07:17.600 --> 07:21.540
Something like 70% of Android's high severity security

07:21.540 --> 07:25.040
vulnerabilities are due to memory safety issues.

07:25.040 --> 07:25.720
Oof.

07:25.720 --> 07:26.680
Yeah, that's not great.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.240
So to help combat this, Google is

07:29.240 --> 07:32.880
excited to announce their words that the Android open source

07:32.880 --> 07:35.800
project now supports the Rust programming

07:35.800 --> 07:39.620
language for developing the operating system itself.

07:39.620 --> 07:41.440
Rust?

07:41.440 --> 07:42.000
On my phone?

07:48.720 --> 07:49.720
Wow.

07:49.720 --> 07:52.320
Google notes that adding the new language to the Android platform

07:52.320 --> 07:56.560
is, quote, a large undertaking.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.400
No kidding.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.320
I mean, that comes alongside Java and Kotlin too, right?

08:00.320 --> 08:02.660
They say that there are tool chains and dependencies that

08:02.660 --> 08:05.000
needed to be maintained, test infrastructure and tooling

08:05.000 --> 08:06.480
that had to be updated.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.160
And then here's a big one.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.920
Developers needed to be trained.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.800
And for the past 18 months, Google

08:11.800 --> 08:14.480
has been adding Rust support to the Android open source

08:14.480 --> 08:17.760
project and has a few early adopter projects

08:17.760 --> 08:19.400
that they'll be talking about.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.720
They say scaling this to more of the OS

08:21.720 --> 08:24.720
is a multi-year project.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.440
So stay tuned, and there will be more updates

08:27.440 --> 08:29.440
from the Google Security blog.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.780
And didn't we see that the Bluetooth stack, Wes,

08:32.780 --> 08:35.320
was one of their first kind of go out there and fix

08:35.320 --> 08:36.280
them projects?

08:36.280 --> 08:38.000
Yes, it was.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.080
You know, I hope Mozilla feels secretly good about this.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.280
I mean, I think this is Google admitting Rust is good stuff.

08:44.280 --> 08:47.000
And they're not just talking about it in a small way.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
They're talking about it alongside Java and Kotlin.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah, I mean, it sounds like this

08:51.000 --> 08:52.840
is going to be a first class language you

08:52.840 --> 08:55.000
can use to implement whatever features you might

08:55.000 --> 08:56.960
need in the base OS itself.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.880
And at least once tooling is up to speed,

08:58.880 --> 09:00.680
once all the build infrastructure is there.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.840
But that's a significant investment and endorsement.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.240
I love that we kind of put our eye on this about a year ago,

09:07.240 --> 09:08.920
that the Rust type was really building.

09:08.920 --> 09:12.480
And Google's been, for that entire time, working on this.

09:12.480 --> 09:15.440
Also, speaking of Rust, listener Mike Kelly

09:15.440 --> 09:18.600
was just looking for an excuse to play around with Rust

09:18.600 --> 09:22.040
and wanted to celebrate Linux Unplugged's 400th episode.

09:22.040 --> 09:26.000
And so he combined a little bit of Rust with a fun project

09:26.000 --> 09:31.440
and created a mini website at lup400.com.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.360
And you know what, Wes?

09:33.360 --> 09:35.560
It's all powered in Rust.

09:35.560 --> 09:40.560
Hey, and it sure looks better than any of our websites.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.960
Right?

09:42.960 --> 09:45.680
I didn't really realize you could develop websites in Rust.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.160
Tells you what a noob I am.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.640
And then the other thing he did, which is really adorable,

09:49.640 --> 09:52.160
is he embedded episode one, which nobody should probably

09:52.160 --> 09:55.080
ever listen to, in there.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.840
So Mike, I guess we should get in contact.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.040
It's time for you to rewrite the entire Jupyter broadcasting

09:59.040 --> 09:59.840
website in Rust.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.120
How on brand would that be?

10:01.120 --> 10:02.240
Cool.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.240
That's what we need.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.600
Thank you, Mike, for doing that.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.000
Yeah, we'll have a link if you want to check it out.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.640
Of course, it's open source.

10:09.640 --> 10:10.920
How great.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.120
So this episode, we thought maybe,

10:14.120 --> 10:16.200
and maybe one of the reasons to go live,

10:16.200 --> 10:19.760
is that we'd have an update on that Linux-powered helicopter

10:19.760 --> 10:22.240
on Mars named Ingenuity.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.840
It was set to take its first test flight.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.840
And then by just about now, as we'd be recording,

10:28.840 --> 10:32.720
we'd have the return data from the surface of Mars.

10:32.720 --> 10:36.240
But it turns out that helicopter flight was delayed.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.000
During a high-speed spin test of the rotors on Friday,

10:39.000 --> 10:40.640
the command sequence controlling the test

10:40.640 --> 10:43.960
ended early due to a watchdog timer expiration.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.000
And as you can imagine, those watchdogs are there

10:46.000 --> 10:48.040
to catch things that aren't working very well.

10:48.040 --> 10:51.000
And so it triggered a process of stop.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.160
We have to diagnose and figure out what went wrong.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.480
But Wes, it seems like maybe they actually figured out

10:56.480 --> 10:57.640
what the failure was.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.760
Yeah, that's right.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.920
I mean, at least so they say.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.960
The Ingenuity team has identified a software solution

11:03.960 --> 11:05.720
for the command sequence issue.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.680
I guess over the weekend, they basically considered

11:07.680 --> 11:10.680
and tested all the ideas of what this could be

11:10.680 --> 11:12.800
and how they could address it.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.040
And they concluded that a tiny little modification

11:16.040 --> 11:19.600
and reinstallation of Ingenuity's flight control software

11:19.600 --> 11:22.280
was the most robust path forward.

11:22.280 --> 11:25.880
Although that sounds pretty tough when this thing is on Mars.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.840
I know, it's like, there's nothing straightforward

11:27.840 --> 11:29.840
about reinstalling a software package

11:29.840 --> 11:32.720
on a tiny helicopter in the belly of a rover.

11:32.720 --> 11:33.560
Actually, now it's not.

11:33.560 --> 11:37.040
But there's just nothing simple about that.

11:37.040 --> 11:40.200
And that's why it has to go through extensive testing.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.040
The software update will modify the process

11:43.040 --> 11:45.560
by which the two flight controllers boot up,

11:45.560 --> 11:48.400
allowing the hardware and software to safely transition

11:48.400 --> 11:51.680
to the flight state and meet the time expectations.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.640
Yeah, and so it sounds like they actually know

11:53.640 --> 11:54.480
what this changes.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.840
It's not gonna be that big of a deal.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.400
They've got mockups here on Earth.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.120
They've definitely experimented with it before,

11:59.120 --> 12:01.680
but they've actually got to transmit all those updates

12:01.680 --> 12:03.800
all the way there to the rover itself,

12:03.800 --> 12:05.400
get it transferred over to Ingenuity,

12:05.400 --> 12:08.080
and then actually run the update command.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.960
And I mean, we've all updated things on servers

12:09.960 --> 12:11.920
and sort of waited for the prompt to come back,

12:11.920 --> 12:14.040
but can you even imagine?

12:15.600 --> 12:16.760
No, Wes.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.480
No, I am not the personality type for this kind of stuff

12:19.480 --> 12:22.920
because I get anxious when we reboot the Arch server

12:22.920 --> 12:24.200
in the garage.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.280
Yeah, I think this is one of those

12:25.280 --> 12:27.920
measure twice, patch once situations.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.600
Yeah, so okay, so they have to get it tested.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.360
They have to get it qualified, as they put it,

12:32.360 --> 12:34.520
and then they have to upload it,

12:34.520 --> 12:36.400
and then it has to install.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.200
So they don't really have a new test flight date.

12:39.200 --> 12:43.360
They say our best estimate is a targeted fluid date.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.640
We're working towards achieving these milestones,

12:45.640 --> 12:48.280
and we should be able to set a flight date next week.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.360
So possibly by next week's episode,

12:50.360 --> 12:52.680
we'll have an update on when the first

12:52.680 --> 12:56.280
Linux-powered helicopter will fly on Mars.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.120
Here's hoping.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.040
And really, we should expect these kind of things, right?

12:59.040 --> 13:01.440
This is all brand new science.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.240
A few things are bound to go wrong.

13:03.240 --> 13:07.040
Lino.com slash unplugged.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.960
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account,

13:09.960 --> 13:12.120
and you go there to support the show.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.900
Linode is our cloud server provider.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.560
I was just messing around this weekend.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.160
I actually love it for setting up multiple servers

13:18.160 --> 13:20.400
and then trying out different distributions

13:20.400 --> 13:21.720
and different software packages,

13:21.720 --> 13:23.000
and then picking a winner,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.200
and then that's the Linode that remains standing,

13:25.200 --> 13:27.360
and I just destroy all of the other ones.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.140
They're the world's largest independent

13:29.140 --> 13:30.240
cloud computing provider,

13:30.240 --> 13:32.360
and they make it easy to get your creation

13:32.360 --> 13:33.800
on the internet fast,

13:33.800 --> 13:35.400
no matter what your skill level is.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.480
If you're brand new to Linux,

13:36.480 --> 13:37.800
you're brand new to servers,

13:37.800 --> 13:39.680
or if you've been doing it for a decade,

13:39.680 --> 13:41.680
they got a technology stack that'll work for you,

13:41.680 --> 13:44.360
and they can help your ideas come to life on the web.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.880
And if you run into any trouble,

13:45.880 --> 13:48.200
Linode comes with amazing,

13:48.200 --> 13:52.200
outstanding 24-7 customer support

13:52.200 --> 13:53.880
by phone or by ticket.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.920
This is like the number one thing I hear now

13:55.920 --> 13:57.040
from our audiences.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.240
Man, I was in a jam,

13:58.240 --> 14:00.640
and Linode stuck with me through the entire thing.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.720
I've got one $5 a month server,

14:02.720 --> 14:04.800
and they still help me out.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.640
On top of that,

14:05.640 --> 14:07.680
they have hundreds of guides and tutorials

14:07.680 --> 14:08.760
to help you get started

14:08.760 --> 14:10.240
and dig through what you need to know

14:10.240 --> 14:12.520
or understand some terminology,

14:12.520 --> 14:15.520
and they have things like how to secure phpMyAdmin

14:15.520 --> 14:16.360
if you're gonna use that,

14:16.360 --> 14:18.520
because honestly, I understand it's a good tool,

14:18.520 --> 14:20.480
but you gotta be a little bit worried

14:20.480 --> 14:21.960
about putting that out in the public.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.280
They have guides to help you manage things like that,

14:24.280 --> 14:26.320
so that way, you have some confidence,

14:26.320 --> 14:27.720
some peace of mind.

14:27.720 --> 14:28.920
That's what's great about their guides.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.360
They give you that kind of confidence

14:30.360 --> 14:31.880
to put this stuff into production,

14:31.880 --> 14:35.000
and they have easy-to-use, one-click applications

14:35.000 --> 14:37.040
for like a LAMP stack or WordPress,

14:37.040 --> 14:40.760
but also some other really kind of really more sophisticated

14:40.760 --> 14:42.240
and complicated things to set up,

14:42.240 --> 14:45.200
from gaming servers to entire e-commerce stacks.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.120
And with S3-compatible object storage,

14:47.120 --> 14:49.000
you can find all kinds of great usage

14:49.000 --> 14:50.480
for things that don't require a server

14:50.480 --> 14:52.720
but still need storage in the cloud.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.040
They have super-fast networking

14:54.040 --> 14:56.480
and 11 data centers worldwide.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.200
Plus, they support shows like this

14:58.200 --> 14:59.960
and events like Linux Fest Northwest,

14:59.960 --> 15:02.240
All Things Open, The Kubuntu Project,

15:02.240 --> 15:04.640
a lot of Linux media out there.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.640
I mean, they're a pretty special company,

15:06.640 --> 15:08.320
and they have a great service.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.720
They've been around since 2003,

15:09.720 --> 15:13.360
and they've really dialed it in like nobody else.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.480
And now, they're just dedicating to make sure

15:15.480 --> 15:17.240
that if you wanna run something on Linux,

15:17.240 --> 15:19.360
it's not gonna run anywhere better than it runs on Linode.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.200
It's gonna run fast, it's gonna run stable,

15:21.200 --> 15:22.880
and you're gonna get a bunch of great information

15:22.880 --> 15:24.720
and fantastic customer support

15:24.720 --> 15:26.760
and a company that loves Linux behind it,

15:26.760 --> 15:28.480
and you can support one of your favorite podcasts

15:28.480 --> 15:29.480
at the same time.

15:29.480 --> 15:32.560
So go to linode.com slash unplugged.

15:32.560 --> 15:37.560
Well, it looks like someone spilled beer all over in here.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.560
I think it's time we clean up, Chris.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.880
Yeah, we could do for a spot of housekeeping around here.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.120
So I just wanna mention that if you wanna get

15:50.120 --> 15:52.120
a little more show, one of the things you can do

15:52.120 --> 15:54.160
is subscribe to the membership program.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.520
That's a great way to get more show.

15:56.520 --> 15:59.640
We have two feeds available, one that is a limited ad feed,

15:59.640 --> 16:04.640
and one that is the full everything we did live feed.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.440
I mean, sometimes it's two hours long,

16:06.440 --> 16:08.000
but there's a lot of content in there.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.720
We try to make it entertaining,

16:09.720 --> 16:11.000
and we make it available as our members

16:11.000 --> 16:12.040
as a way to say thank you.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.160
So if you'd like to become a member,

16:13.160 --> 16:17.280
go to unpluggedcore.com, keep the unplugged program

16:17.280 --> 16:20.760
independent, and reduce the ad load needed

16:20.760 --> 16:23.240
to make the show actually sustainable.

16:23.240 --> 16:25.480
And check out jupiterbroadcasting.com.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.440
We got a batch of great shows, like a bouquet.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.800
Yeah, there you go, a bouquet of podcasts,

16:31.800 --> 16:36.400
a bouquet of podcasts over at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.920
And last but not least, join the LUP Lug on Sundays.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.520
They get together, they self-organize,

16:42.520 --> 16:45.120
and they hang out and talk about, well, things you love.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.360
That's in our Mumble Room.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.080
You can get details at linuxunplugged.com.

16:49.080 --> 16:51.840
And then you join Sundays, noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern,

16:51.840 --> 16:54.600
and it's just right there in our Mumble lobby.

16:54.600 --> 16:58.320
And the great thing is, then you're all set up with Mumble.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.640
And you can come to the live show if you get a Tuesday.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.760
Maybe, I don't know, maybe you get the Rona.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.080
You wanna take some time off from work.

17:06.080 --> 17:08.760
They're not gonna ask any questions, you know?

17:08.760 --> 17:10.120
You just come show up in the Mumble,

17:10.120 --> 17:11.840
we won't ask any questions.

17:11.840 --> 17:12.880
I mean, how do you think there's,

17:12.880 --> 17:15.440
now there's nearly 30 people in there right now.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.800
You think one of them, at least one of them

17:16.800 --> 17:18.620
must be calling in sick.

17:18.620 --> 17:21.080
We're on to you, and you could do that too.

17:22.120 --> 17:23.960
Details at linuxunplugged.com.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.760
That's probably our best housekeeping ever.

17:27.760 --> 17:28.760
By far.

17:28.760 --> 17:31.000
I think so, I think so.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.280
I think, you know, that was good.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.560
You know, we connected with people there.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.160
Well, and you decided to just double down,

17:35.160 --> 17:36.960
and instead of cleaning up the beer you spilled,

17:36.960 --> 17:38.280
you just spilled beer on the places

17:38.280 --> 17:40.800
that it hadn't previously reached, so it's consistent.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.800
Yeah, I like the way it smells.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.020
So, don't host your own email server.

17:46.080 --> 17:46.920
But you know what?

17:46.920 --> 17:48.200
I don't really feel like going into a lecture

17:48.200 --> 17:49.240
of reasons why you shouldn't.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.160
I feel like we've covered it,

17:50.160 --> 17:53.720
but super briefly, it's hard to get it right.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.780
And it's something that people really rely on,

17:55.780 --> 17:58.820
and it's really easy to get sucked into a black hole

17:58.820 --> 18:01.200
where people start rejecting your emails.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.040
And not to mention,

18:02.040 --> 18:04.320
there's a lot of security considerations.

18:04.320 --> 18:05.360
Yeah, and for some reason,

18:05.360 --> 18:07.480
email is like internet infrastructure.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.440
You know, businesses, banks, whatever.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.200
They expect that emails go through,

18:11.200 --> 18:13.680
and you probably expect that you receive your email.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.320
So, if you are gonna play with this,

18:15.320 --> 18:16.560
at least keep that in mind,

18:16.560 --> 18:17.840
and maybe do it on a domain

18:17.840 --> 18:20.280
that you can experiment around with,

18:20.280 --> 18:21.600
and not your main one.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.440
Well, and you gotta figure,

18:22.440 --> 18:23.800
people in our audience, you know,

18:23.800 --> 18:25.680
they maybe have a project they're working on,

18:25.680 --> 18:26.760
or a small team of people.

18:26.760 --> 18:27.940
Or you have like our Lug, right?

18:27.940 --> 18:28.860
Wouldn't it be kind of cool

18:28.860 --> 18:31.920
if our Lug could have an email address,

18:31.920 --> 18:34.680
and members of our Lug could have their own email?

18:34.680 --> 18:35.920
We were thinking for 400.

18:35.920 --> 18:38.520
That'd be kind of a fun thing to do for our Lug,

18:38.520 --> 18:41.080
is create a Lug Lug email address.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.640
And so, that's kind of what we were thinking,

18:43.640 --> 18:44.880
is that's a great example

18:44.880 --> 18:46.760
where you got a small group of people,

18:46.760 --> 18:48.200
you don't necessarily wanna be paying

18:48.200 --> 18:50.480
five plus dollars a month per mailbox

18:50.480 --> 18:52.160
to host it somewhere,

18:52.160 --> 18:53.420
and you just wanna, whatever,

18:53.420 --> 18:55.480
like you just wanna pay whatever the cost is

18:55.480 --> 18:56.800
to run the server,

18:56.800 --> 18:58.840
and create as many accounts as you want,

18:58.840 --> 19:00.560
three to 100 or whatever.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.860
And that's the goal we're kind of shooting for,

19:02.860 --> 19:05.240
is creating a humble mail server with,

19:05.240 --> 19:06.260
that's my word of the day today,

19:06.260 --> 19:07.100
is everything's just,

19:07.100 --> 19:08.720
I got a lot of humility after getting my butt

19:08.720 --> 19:09.560
kicked by a robe.

19:09.560 --> 19:10.600
Mine's not gonna be humble.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.200
Mine's gonna be bold, brazen on the internet.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.040
Good for you.

19:14.040 --> 19:16.120
Mine, everything is humble pie with me.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.120
Cause once you've gotten your butt kicked by a robe,

19:18.120 --> 19:20.640
you don't walk around with your head hanging high.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.400
Let me just put it that way.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.840
But something simple, not too complicated.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.760
And there are actually other reasons,

19:26.760 --> 19:29.220
I think, to host your own server.

19:29.220 --> 19:31.060
Privacy and control being big ones.

19:31.060 --> 19:33.680
You have full control over both the server

19:33.680 --> 19:35.160
and your email itself.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.880
You can view the logs of incoming

19:36.880 --> 19:38.720
and outgoing messages directly.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.480
You can pick the applications you want,

19:40.480 --> 19:42.800
so you can mix and match the server software

19:42.800 --> 19:44.360
and the client software.

19:44.360 --> 19:46.720
And you also are implementing your own

19:46.720 --> 19:47.960
data retention policies.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.240
Perhaps you want to keep things forever,

19:50.240 --> 19:52.800
or maybe you don't want to keep things past 30 days.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.400
You get to choose.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.720
I mean, it's also probably worth saying that email is,

19:56.720 --> 19:58.940
for all of the difficulties we were just mentioning,

19:58.940 --> 20:00.760
it is still one of those things that like,

20:00.760 --> 20:02.320
it just interoperates, right?

20:02.320 --> 20:04.440
You don't have to go officially like register somewhere.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.180
There's not one party controlling it all.

20:06.180 --> 20:09.040
If you want to host it, if you get it right anyway,

20:09.040 --> 20:12.120
you can, and that's cool and worth celebrating.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.520
Yeah, and really, I think there is the cost aspect too.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.360
Right.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.220
This is something everybody has to find a balance on,

20:18.220 --> 20:21.200
but there's this, you're never really gonna pay more

20:21.200 --> 20:23.440
than just the cost of running the server in your time,

20:23.440 --> 20:25.240
where with a lot of hosted solutions,

20:25.240 --> 20:26.280
you're gonna pay per person.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.000
Yeah, or I mean, it can kind of vary, right?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.240
Like they get to choose how they want to monetize

20:30.240 --> 20:31.140
off that service.

20:31.140 --> 20:33.300
And so it might align with your use case.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.920
I've been using Zoho for a while,

20:34.920 --> 20:39.080
so for some of my non-Gmail or other hosted domains,

20:39.080 --> 20:40.120
and it works pretty fine.

20:40.120 --> 20:43.200
I get like aliases, but if I ever did wanna add more users

20:43.200 --> 20:45.200
or say I started a small business with some friends

20:45.200 --> 20:46.280
and I wanted to add them on there

20:46.280 --> 20:49.600
or for an open source project or something for the show,

20:49.600 --> 20:52.780
it's not very flexible, at least without paying more money.

20:52.780 --> 20:56.380
And that has had me thinking about self-hosting for a while.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.580
Yeah, and there's just sort of like,

20:58.580 --> 21:00.920
can I still do this, you know?

21:00.920 --> 21:02.640
Like, can I still make this work?

21:02.640 --> 21:06.160
Cause I used to do this, but I haven't done it a long time.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.080
And in fact, one of my very first jobs

21:09.080 --> 21:12.120
when I got into IT, like my second or third job,

21:12.120 --> 21:14.480
I can't remember, but it was early into it.

21:14.480 --> 21:17.560
They just let me go on managing their mail server

21:17.560 --> 21:19.780
and it was a deep dive.

21:19.780 --> 21:23.800
And I really kind of became a, I became a pro.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.280
I really got into it for a while.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.800
And I'm wondering like, does that skillset still exist?

21:28.800 --> 21:31.440
Will that come back as we do this?

21:31.440 --> 21:34.960
Is hosting your own email server just like riding a bike?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.120
You know, speaking of that,

21:36.120 --> 21:38.000
I'm not sure I've seen you ride a bike either.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.400
Oh, well, you know, if we could come up with a show reason,

21:41.400 --> 21:42.240
you'll see me do it.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.840
That's all it takes.

21:43.840 --> 21:47.440
Every mail server out there can really kind of be broken

21:47.440 --> 21:49.940
down into three separate software components.

21:49.940 --> 21:52.400
You have the mail transfer agent that relays mail

21:52.400 --> 21:54.880
between your server and the wider internet.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.300
You have the mail delivery agent that takes mail

21:57.300 --> 22:01.880
from that MTA and then sends it to the individual mailboxes.

22:01.880 --> 22:05.280
And you have the interface that clients will connect to it,

22:05.280 --> 22:08.840
which is often like IMAP or even used to be POP3,

22:08.840 --> 22:10.880
which lets users check their email

22:10.880 --> 22:12.840
from their preferred client.

22:12.840 --> 22:14.720
And then there's like additional stuff

22:14.720 --> 22:16.040
you have to kind of consider, right?

22:16.040 --> 22:17.960
Because that's the basics of a mail server

22:17.960 --> 22:19.680
and you have to pick those software components

22:19.680 --> 22:21.400
that you think do the best job.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.080
But there's also security components

22:23.080 --> 22:24.800
to setting up a mail server today.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.320
And of course, there's DNS.

22:28.320 --> 22:31.160
Yes, our old friend, the domain name system.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.320
You're gonna need to set something up

22:32.320 --> 22:35.160
so people know how to reach your email server.

22:35.160 --> 22:40.160
You'll need at least a MX record, SPF and pointer.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.400
Starting with MX there,

22:42.400 --> 22:44.680
that's gonna tell people how to send you email, right?

22:44.680 --> 22:47.800
Like I've got an email west at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.760
And when an outgoing server looks that up

22:49.760 --> 22:50.880
and says, how do I send email?

22:50.880 --> 22:52.920
They go find jupiterbroadcasting.com,

22:52.920 --> 22:55.080
look for the MX record that tells them the server

22:55.080 --> 22:57.120
to point to, and then they can actually connect

22:57.120 --> 22:58.540
and start sending email.

22:58.540 --> 23:01.120
And the important thing to consider here too

23:01.120 --> 23:03.320
is there's security things around DNS as well,

23:03.320 --> 23:05.820
like SPF records, which help establish the legitimacy

23:05.820 --> 23:08.160
of your mail server and reduce the chances

23:08.160 --> 23:10.440
that somebody's spoofing as you.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.380
And the SPF record for your domain

23:12.380 --> 23:14.560
tells other receiving mail servers

23:14.560 --> 23:17.440
which outgoing servers are legit to kind of receive from.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.080
So it's a lookup for them to do

23:19.080 --> 23:21.480
to see if the sender is a legitimate sender or not.

23:21.480 --> 23:25.120
And don't forget to set up reverse DNS.

23:25.120 --> 23:27.520
Yeah, I know, sometimes we just get lazy,

23:27.520 --> 23:29.000
we just do the one direction,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.120
but the reverse DNS for your mail server

23:31.120 --> 23:33.600
really should match the host name of your server.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.680
So people go to query, hey, what's this IP?

23:35.680 --> 23:37.240
Who's sending me this mail?

23:37.240 --> 23:38.080
That needs to match,

23:38.080 --> 23:40.900
otherwise you might get some ugly rejections thing saying,

23:40.900 --> 23:44.340
hey, the reverse DNS does not match your SMTP banner.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.880
And you're not gonna have fun with that.

23:45.880 --> 23:49.640
Oh man, this is really bringing me back.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.560
There is a lot for you and I to consider.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.660
And I mean, I would imagine we'd never probably have

23:54.660 --> 23:57.840
more than 50 email accounts on this box.

23:57.840 --> 24:01.200
But even this isn't getting into like the antivirus

24:01.200 --> 24:02.100
and spam prevention stuff,

24:02.100 --> 24:04.080
because one of the things I did back in the day

24:04.080 --> 24:06.520
was I'd have to route mail through Clam AV

24:06.520 --> 24:08.520
and scan it on the mail server.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.620
So that way, hopefully I wasn't delivering viruses

24:10.620 --> 24:11.800
to Windows users.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.000
Right, and I mean, these days,

24:13.000 --> 24:14.960
I think with web mail being so common,

24:14.960 --> 24:17.880
especially hosted by big parties like Googs or Microsoft,

24:17.880 --> 24:19.080
they do all of that for you.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.280
You probably expect that.

24:20.280 --> 24:22.960
And if you suddenly have an unfiltered inbox,

24:22.960 --> 24:25.880
especially if you've pasted that email around the internet,

24:25.880 --> 24:27.440
that could be a nasty surprise.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.760
And I'm glad you mentioned web mail too,

24:29.760 --> 24:31.440
because that's something else I think you and I

24:31.440 --> 24:32.940
should consider for this project,

24:32.940 --> 24:36.480
because if this is kind of like a vanity account,

24:36.480 --> 24:38.240
it's kind of like an extra account for people

24:38.240 --> 24:40.240
who participate in the community they wanted or whatever.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.080
Like, I don't know,

24:41.080 --> 24:42.200
I haven't really thought through this completely,

24:42.200 --> 24:44.700
other than I kind of picture the use case

24:44.700 --> 24:47.120
being lub lug members who wanna reach out to guests

24:47.120 --> 24:48.840
or organize events for the lug

24:48.840 --> 24:50.400
and wanna come from an email account

24:50.400 --> 24:53.200
that kind of seems sort of semi-official and connected,

24:53.200 --> 24:56.320
like jupitercolony.org or something like that.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.840
But I don't really envision that being more

24:57.840 --> 24:58.880
than a handful of people

24:58.880 --> 25:00.920
and then whatever you and I choose to use it for.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.640
But even there, it's like, well,

25:02.640 --> 25:04.680
okay, so it's not gonna be their primary email account.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.480
So how can we make it accessible to them?

25:06.480 --> 25:09.880
And web mail is probably one of the ways to do that,

25:09.880 --> 25:12.080
but there's a lot of web mails to choose from.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.380
Yeah, I'd like one that doesn't suck, please.

25:14.380 --> 25:15.600
I mean, at least if I'm gonna use it

25:15.600 --> 25:18.160
and not just have to set up a client because it's so bad.

25:18.160 --> 25:21.380
Yeah, this is definitely one I could use some advice from,

25:21.380 --> 25:22.760
from anybody in the mumble room

25:22.760 --> 25:23.720
or people that are listening

25:23.720 --> 25:27.040
that wanna go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

25:27.040 --> 25:29.760
Assuming we set up kind of a standard mail server set up

25:29.760 --> 25:31.560
with IMAP on the backend,

25:31.560 --> 25:34.360
what would you recommend we use for the web mail front end?

25:34.360 --> 25:37.520
Because our goal here is

25:37.520 --> 25:40.540
to kind of get everybody's feedback from this episode

25:40.540 --> 25:42.920
and go build something by the next episode.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.160
It's a little ambitious,

25:44.160 --> 25:48.760
but that's kind of what we hope to do with episode 402

25:48.760 --> 25:50.760
is say, okay, the email server's up and running.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.160
Here's how we built it.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.560
Here's kind of what we considered.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.400
Here's the web mail clients we're going with.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.400
Here's the desktop clients we're going with

25:58.400 --> 26:00.760
and then give away some email addresses on it

26:00.760 --> 26:01.600
and stuff like that.

26:01.600 --> 26:04.480
It's kind of what our intention is for 402.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.560
But I think the number one thing I'm hung up on right now

26:06.560 --> 26:08.240
is what web mail client to go with

26:08.240 --> 26:11.520
because part of me is sort of leaning towards simple,

26:11.520 --> 26:12.440
like squirrel mail.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.280
Classic.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.100
Right?

26:14.100 --> 26:15.000
You know it works, right?

26:15.000 --> 26:16.520
And then part of me is kind of leaning towards something

26:16.520 --> 26:18.320
like round cube or something

26:18.320 --> 26:19.320
that's maybe a little more modern,

26:19.320 --> 26:21.760
but I don't even know what that would be anymore.

26:21.760 --> 26:22.600
Yeah, that's just it.

26:22.600 --> 26:23.640
It's like, it's been so long

26:23.640 --> 26:25.080
since I've really played in this space,

26:25.080 --> 26:27.720
but you know our talented audience out there,

26:27.720 --> 26:30.480
there's email self-hosters among them

26:30.480 --> 26:31.920
and they've surely got some tips.

26:31.920 --> 26:32.760
I hope so.

26:32.760 --> 26:33.600
I hope so.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.680
And then I'm going to take all of this experience

26:35.680 --> 26:39.160
and see if my current bias

26:39.160 --> 26:42.240
that I still think people probably on the whole

26:42.240 --> 26:44.180
shouldn't self-host email.

26:44.180 --> 26:46.640
That's how I feel today.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.040
We'll see if that's how I feel after we do this experiment

26:49.040 --> 26:51.240
because I felt that way about Arch too.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.080
Exactly.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.300
Let us be your lazy admins.

26:54.300 --> 26:55.360
We'll try it out.

26:55.360 --> 26:56.200
See if it works.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.200
See how big of a mess we make.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.720
And then you can judge, is it worth the time?

27:00.720 --> 27:01.920
Yeah, and you know what?

27:01.920 --> 27:05.240
Honestly, I thought Nextcloud would blow up on our face too

27:05.240 --> 27:08.560
and here we are like almost two years into using it now

27:08.560 --> 27:11.560
and we've had to make modifications to how we use it

27:11.560 --> 27:13.920
and it hasn't been perfect and it's sinking,

27:13.920 --> 27:18.240
but once we learned kind of how to use it, it's been fine.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.080
Yeah, yeah.

27:19.080 --> 27:21.160
I mean, we definitely like to complain about it sometimes

27:21.160 --> 27:23.840
and there are improvements it could have,

27:23.840 --> 27:26.180
but we haven't kicked it out of our infrastructure

27:26.180 --> 27:28.760
and more often than not, it's a dependable part of it.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.800
Yeah, and then we can update you on how it's going to

27:30.800 --> 27:34.440
and stuff like that and I'm funny.

27:34.440 --> 27:38.020
I kind of enjoy the idea of my prejudice being flipped.

27:38.020 --> 27:40.480
I like the idea that I'm coming into something thinking

27:40.480 --> 27:42.480
we shouldn't be doing this, it's not going to work

27:42.480 --> 27:44.800
and then have it be successful and have to kind of go,

27:44.800 --> 27:47.440
oh, okay, it was worth doing

27:47.440 --> 27:50.020
and then kind of try to come to terms with,

27:50.020 --> 27:51.200
well, why was it worth doing?

27:51.200 --> 27:52.240
What did I get wrong?

27:52.240 --> 27:54.240
What was I missing until I tried it?

27:54.240 --> 27:55.560
And I think that's a good experience

27:55.560 --> 27:56.540
to share with the audience too.

27:56.540 --> 27:58.280
So that's what I'm hoping we get out of this.

27:58.280 --> 27:59.580
Yeah, this is definitely one of those areas

27:59.580 --> 28:01.800
where you see a lot of different mixed advice from folks.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.120
Some people have no problems doing it

28:03.120 --> 28:05.240
and then you have a lot of, for good reason,

28:05.240 --> 28:07.360
people chiming in saying like, look, this is just hard.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.280
You might have difficulties

28:08.280 --> 28:10.120
and if you don't want to spend hours on your Saturday,

28:10.120 --> 28:11.840
troubleshooting, don't try,

28:11.840 --> 28:15.200
but you can't know until you actually try it for yourself.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.480
I'm coming into the back end of this conversation,

28:17.480 --> 28:19.480
so I'm not going to ask why you want to do this.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.400
Hello, Wimpy.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.640
Hello.

28:21.640 --> 28:26.400
But you could potentially save yourself some heartache

28:26.400 --> 28:29.680
by capitalizing on things like Mail in a Box,

28:29.680 --> 28:34.680
where there is a community maintaining a deployable,

28:35.120 --> 28:38.400
full stack mail environment,

28:38.400 --> 28:40.760
which pulls on multiple people

28:40.760 --> 28:42.720
with experience in that space.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.320
Wes, we've gotten a lot of recommendations

28:44.320 --> 28:45.880
for Mail in a Box over the years.

28:45.880 --> 28:48.560
I think, you know, probably at least a dozen.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.760
I know there's some competitors,

28:49.760 --> 28:51.640
but that's the one that sticks out in my mind,

28:51.640 --> 28:53.560
even though I've actually never tried it.

28:53.560 --> 28:54.720
Yeah, I haven't tried it either.

28:54.720 --> 28:57.280
And neither have I, and I only cite that one

28:57.280 --> 28:59.560
because it's the name that came to the front of my mind,

28:59.560 --> 29:02.600
but there must be other things like that.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.840
It was interesting, both of you saying,

29:04.840 --> 29:07.640
it's been ages since you've done something like this.

29:07.640 --> 29:10.240
I can't, well, in fact, I can remember the last time

29:10.240 --> 29:14.480
I did anything to do with mail servers was in 2016,

29:14.480 --> 29:17.480
when my last job was to maintain a fleet

29:17.480 --> 29:22.480
of massive mail servers for a CV application

29:24.080 --> 29:28.040
that was sending out like 27 million emails a minute,

29:28.040 --> 29:30.160
like 24 seven or something.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.440
I love those kinds of memories.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.400
You know, looking back at that,

29:32.400 --> 29:34.080
thinking that is crazy today,

29:34.080 --> 29:36.000
like something you would never catch yourself doing now,

29:36.000 --> 29:38.360
right, I would assume you just would never build that again.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.040
Well, I mean, I didn't build it,

29:40.040 --> 29:43.640
I inherited this sort of, you know, of course.

29:43.640 --> 29:44.800
Oh, those are even better.

29:44.800 --> 29:48.880
And you know, things have moved on

29:48.880 --> 29:51.280
in the intervening six years that would mean

29:51.280 --> 29:53.680
that you just wouldn't do it quite like that ever again.

29:53.680 --> 29:56.360
But yeah, I mean, interesting experiment.

29:56.360 --> 29:58.200
It will be, we shall see.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.280
And I guess we know who to ask for help.

30:00.280 --> 30:02.680
Yeah, you're gonna be our go-to mail admin.

30:02.680 --> 30:04.200
I am tempted to try Mail in a Box.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.480
I'm very tempted to try that

30:05.480 --> 30:07.680
because we have gotten it recommended so many times.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.600
You recommend it yourself, Wimpy.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.200
It might be the way we go.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.240
Like I say, I've never used it, it's just the name I know.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.600
The orange one, you have a suggestion for us as well.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.080
Yeah, years and years ago,

30:18.080 --> 30:20.800
when I made the terrible decision of hosting my own email,

30:20.800 --> 30:24.720
I used a alternative to Mail in a Box called MailCal,

30:24.720 --> 30:27.000
which is sort of this Dockerise setup.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.880
So you just run a command, it runs everything for you.

30:29.880 --> 30:32.000
And that I found to be really nice.

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
It uses a alternative to Roundcube called Sogo,

30:37.800 --> 30:41.000
which is sort of materially fancy, looks a bit pretty,

30:41.000 --> 30:44.400
but basically is webmail and calendar and all of that stuff.

30:44.400 --> 30:48.120
And from what I used of it, it was really quite nice

30:48.120 --> 30:51.520
and just sort of got out of your way and just worked.

30:51.520 --> 30:52.800
How did you spell that?

30:52.800 --> 30:54.440
Sogo, S-O-G-O.

30:54.440 --> 30:55.880
Oh, okay, that's easy.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.120
All right, I will definitely look at that.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.320
Yeah, the webmail thing is like,

30:58.320 --> 31:00.600
I'm trying to chew on that one right now.

31:00.600 --> 31:03.400
I'm not sure if Mail in a Box provides a webmail client

31:03.400 --> 31:04.400
I might be worth looking into.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.040
Maybe they've already picked something there.

31:06.040 --> 31:09.720
The other option is that you could go super simple

31:09.720 --> 31:11.920
and just go full on like Zimbra.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.920
I have run Zimbra for a couple of clients.

31:13.920 --> 31:16.240
I use Zimbra also as a mechanism

31:16.240 --> 31:17.680
to backup exchange servers.

31:17.680 --> 31:20.480
And I recall Zimbra had a fantastic search.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.840
So if you're somebody out there looking for

31:21.840 --> 31:25.400
kind of a suite of tools with really good search

31:25.400 --> 31:27.680
and like a SQL backed email database,

31:27.680 --> 31:29.080
Zimbra is really good.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.480
I don't know if it's still the case,

31:30.480 --> 31:33.800
but certainly back in the day when I was deploying Zimbra,

31:33.800 --> 31:38.080
my citation for successful deployments was Red Hat.

31:38.080 --> 31:41.160
I know they were using Zimbra internally.

31:41.160 --> 31:45.200
Oh, yeah, I've come across it a couple of times.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.680
I'm surprised it didn't take off.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.760
I feel like it was a better exchange.

31:49.760 --> 31:53.600
Yeah, it was designed to be exchange compatible

31:53.600 --> 31:55.360
stroke compliant.

31:55.360 --> 31:56.880
And it was one of these weird things.

31:56.880 --> 31:59.960
It originally grew up out of, you know, Yahoo acquired it.

31:59.960 --> 32:02.280
It got kicked around between, you know,

32:02.280 --> 32:04.160
different organizations over the years,

32:04.160 --> 32:05.760
but it was always very solid.

32:05.760 --> 32:07.920
Yeah, I had some heavy hitting clients

32:07.920 --> 32:11.480
that really used email and we ended up switching to Zimbra

32:11.480 --> 32:13.920
for their archival and search solution

32:13.920 --> 32:16.520
because they just simply couldn't find it in Outlook

32:16.520 --> 32:18.480
when they were looking for stuff fast enough.

32:18.480 --> 32:19.920
And Zimbra was just faster.

32:19.920 --> 32:20.760
So that is a really good one,

32:20.760 --> 32:22.520
but I think that's probably too much

32:22.520 --> 32:24.520
because that's like the kitchen sink approach to email.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.080
It's everything.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.600
Yeah, it's all the things without a doubt, yeah.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.440
That'd be a good, like,

32:29.440 --> 32:31.000
if you were looking to replace Google apps,

32:31.000 --> 32:32.320
you didn't just need core email,

32:32.320 --> 32:34.360
but you needed like a whole suite of functionality,

32:34.360 --> 32:36.520
including calendar and collaboration space.

32:36.520 --> 32:37.600
Indeed, yeah.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.560
You combine that with something like Mattermost

32:39.560 --> 32:42.240
and you'd have a really good self-hostable

32:42.240 --> 32:44.400
internal collaboration suite.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.720
Those two things together would be pretty good.

32:47.720 --> 32:50.720
So I guess we'll wait for the emails to come in.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.800
We'll review our options and then next episode

32:53.800 --> 32:55.880
we'll announce our decision on which way we went

32:55.880 --> 32:57.680
and if it's up and running or not.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.240
We'll see if we get it going.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.800
I hope I haven't overcommitted us, Wes.

33:01.800 --> 33:05.600
I may have oversold, but we're gonna get done.

33:05.600 --> 33:06.920
Yeah, let's find out.

33:06.920 --> 33:08.600
Hopefully at least we'll have some email.

33:08.600 --> 33:11.320
We can get some tests and see how many, you know,

33:11.320 --> 33:13.800
audience mails actually make it into the show.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.800
Yeah, all right.

33:15.800 --> 33:19.880
Well, before we go, I really,

33:19.880 --> 33:22.360
I really got my arse kicked by a robe recently.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.000
And so I thought I'd share that tale with you

33:24.000 --> 33:26.840
because we're just about a year

33:26.840 --> 33:28.360
into things getting serious.

33:28.360 --> 33:29.880
We're not at the year mark of being independent,

33:29.880 --> 33:33.080
but we're a year mark into the process beginning.

33:33.080 --> 33:38.080
And, you know, I thought when I was envisioning one day,

33:39.040 --> 33:40.920
back then, you know, this at this stage,

33:40.920 --> 33:45.920
I was just fantasizing, thinking to myself,

33:45.960 --> 33:48.120
you know, if I were to go independent again

33:48.120 --> 33:52.880
and try to survive, especially during a pandemic,

33:54.040 --> 33:57.080
I know that I'd have to do more than just sponsors.

33:57.080 --> 33:58.880
And the membership program was part of that.

33:58.880 --> 34:00.920
And so thank you everybody who has become a member

34:00.920 --> 34:03.320
because that was a critical part in making it

34:03.320 --> 34:06.120
to as far as we have at this stage.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.920
And I figured advertising would be a critical part of that.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.080
And it has, and that's why, you know,

34:12.080 --> 34:14.600
companies like Linode coming on board,

34:14.600 --> 34:16.800
literally, I'm not exaggerating at all

34:16.800 --> 34:18.200
when I say I made it possible

34:18.200 --> 34:20.880
for Jupiter Broadcasting to exist.

34:20.880 --> 34:24.120
But I also knew that I couldn't just rely on those two things.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.120
I've been doing this for 14 years

34:26.120 --> 34:28.040
and that's like 50 years,

34:28.040 --> 34:30.440
at least maybe 100 years in internet time.

34:30.440 --> 34:33.200
And one of the things I know that's absolutely true

34:33.200 --> 34:35.240
is if you have one or two income sources,

34:35.240 --> 34:36.480
you're gonna die.

34:36.480 --> 34:40.040
Because I've been around when YouTube pulled the plug

34:40.040 --> 34:41.960
on advertising the first time around.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.200
I've been around when Amazon,

34:43.200 --> 34:45.520
which represented like 20% of our revenue at the time

34:45.520 --> 34:47.640
or 30% of our revenue at the time.

34:47.640 --> 34:50.600
I was there when Amazon just one day pulled the plug on us

34:50.600 --> 34:53.040
for doing stuff that still other networks

34:53.040 --> 34:56.320
and podcasts and YouTubers are still doing today.

34:56.320 --> 34:59.680
It's really, you know, but you gotta diversify there.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.960
So I knew when I was thinking about,

35:01.960 --> 35:04.320
boy, do I wanna make this transition,

35:04.320 --> 35:06.520
I knew I'd have to figure out

35:06.520 --> 35:08.880
my merchandise and swag game one day.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.760
And it's been just embarrassingly too long

35:11.760 --> 35:13.840
since we've had anything new.

35:13.840 --> 35:16.080
It's been over two years now.

35:16.080 --> 35:19.640
And it's something that I enjoy

35:19.640 --> 35:21.160
and it's something,

35:21.160 --> 35:23.080
it's another one of those physical manifestations

35:23.080 --> 35:26.160
of what we make becomes a physical product.

35:26.160 --> 35:29.360
And we recently went on kind of like a archeological dig

35:29.360 --> 35:33.640
here in the studio and we found a bunch of old swag.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.940
And I had an emotional reaction to finding this stuff.

35:35.940 --> 35:39.160
And I don't normally have an emotional reaction to things

35:39.160 --> 35:43.220
except for Star Trek ships that those I like.

35:43.220 --> 35:44.900
But mostly like, you know,

35:44.900 --> 35:47.560
one of the reasons I moved into a class ARV

35:47.560 --> 35:49.240
is I wanted to get rid of everything.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.760
I don't really wanna have attachments.

35:50.760 --> 35:51.880
I'm not big on that.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.640
But when I saw this swag, I felt something.

35:54.640 --> 35:57.040
I don't know what you humans call it, but I felt something.

35:57.040 --> 35:58.180
And it was a good something.

35:58.180 --> 36:00.560
And I realized this stuff is special.

36:00.560 --> 36:03.560
We have some really special items.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.180
And I wanna do more of that.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.800
Because it's like, I can look back and I remember,

36:07.800 --> 36:09.920
I see an item and I think of an event,

36:09.920 --> 36:12.160
or I think of a show milestone,

36:12.160 --> 36:14.960
or I think of the way that the audience responded

36:14.960 --> 36:16.520
to an item that we did.

36:16.520 --> 36:19.120
And it makes like the past real

36:19.120 --> 36:22.800
in a way that I kind of lost touch with

36:22.800 --> 36:25.440
over the last couple of years, especially the last year.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.960
And also, getting this figured out

36:28.960 --> 36:31.480
is just a good business strategy, really.

36:31.480 --> 36:32.960
I mean, that's just obvious on its face.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.160
It's critical to making a long-term business successful.

36:36.160 --> 36:39.080
So all of this, knowing all of this,

36:39.080 --> 36:42.520
it created this self-inflicted pressure.

36:42.520 --> 36:47.000
Like I've been stressing out really bad to get swag right.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.200
And I wanna do things that are unique and fun

36:49.200 --> 36:50.960
that aren't just like the stuff you find

36:50.960 --> 36:53.220
on every fulfillment website out there.

36:53.220 --> 36:55.440
And so I thought, let's shoot for the moon

36:55.440 --> 37:00.240
and let's do a fabulous embroidered robe called the Coder.

37:00.240 --> 37:03.260
And it'll be a limited item.

37:03.260 --> 37:05.600
It'd be a robe that we can sell on the Coder Radio program

37:05.600 --> 37:07.080
to celebrate 400 episodes

37:07.080 --> 37:08.960
because Coder Radio just hit that milestone as well.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.400
What a glorious dream.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.640
I mean, you know, a custom swag worthy

37:12.640 --> 37:14.940
of the epic history of that show.

37:14.940 --> 37:15.780
Yep.

37:15.780 --> 37:17.040
Tyler's saying right now in the chat room,

37:17.040 --> 37:18.780
he says, Chris, last I still have my challenge coins.

37:18.780 --> 37:19.620
Right?

37:19.620 --> 37:20.440
Right?

37:20.440 --> 37:21.720
I mean, Tyler, I love the challenge coin.

37:21.720 --> 37:22.840
It was the best.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.680
I was just about to say,

37:24.680 --> 37:27.480
I've been sorting out my office and listen to this.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.200
Challenge coin?

37:29.200 --> 37:31.280
Do challenge coins being struck together,

37:31.280 --> 37:34.280
which I found from 2017 recently.

37:34.280 --> 37:38.320
I just found a cache of them as well, about 20 of them.

37:39.480 --> 37:41.080
And I love them.

37:41.080 --> 37:43.040
They're very special.

37:43.040 --> 37:45.640
And, you know, they're like limited in a way.

37:45.640 --> 37:46.480
They're like, anyways,

37:46.480 --> 37:50.080
it's just gave me a whole new appreciation for swag.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.680
But so I wanted to do this robe

37:51.680 --> 37:55.400
and the robe was the dumbest possible idea I could have had

37:55.400 --> 37:57.640
in like a year, really.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.000
The last year is probably my worst idea

37:59.000 --> 38:01.300
in the last three years, maybe four years.

38:01.300 --> 38:03.480
Now that I think about it,

38:03.480 --> 38:06.440
it might be my worst idea in the last five years.

38:06.440 --> 38:08.860
What I learned was that shipping a custom product

38:08.860 --> 38:12.420
domestically is tricky to ship something that's produced,

38:12.420 --> 38:14.960
custom hand produced domestically,

38:14.960 --> 38:19.080
to ship that internationally, holy crap.

38:19.080 --> 38:22.040
I had like quotes of like $185

38:22.040 --> 38:24.960
just to ship a $65 robe to Denmark.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.920
It's just basically not possible at a reasonable cost.

38:28.920 --> 38:31.000
When you work with these one-off shops,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.120
their business isn't procurement

38:33.120 --> 38:34.320
and shipping around the world.

38:34.320 --> 38:38.360
Their business is taking these items and doing embroidery.

38:38.360 --> 38:42.120
And so they don't have like these depots around the world

38:42.120 --> 38:44.900
to make shipping more reasonable at international rates.

38:44.900 --> 38:47.740
And boy, do I have a whole new appreciation

38:47.740 --> 38:49.640
for Amazon's cheap shipping.

38:49.640 --> 38:51.880
What a massive market advantage that is for them, Wes.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.940
They can ship stuff at prices I could never dream of.

38:54.940 --> 38:57.040
No, I mean, we don't have a bulk discount.

38:57.040 --> 38:59.140
We don't have established supply lines.

38:59.140 --> 39:00.060
This is all new.

39:00.060 --> 39:02.480
We gotta get that drone program up and going, obviously.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.520
That I think we have the supplies for.

39:05.400 --> 39:08.080
They have shipping prices that are just not even achievable

39:08.080 --> 39:10.580
by small businesses like a shop like mine.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.680
But for the community and for the business,

39:14.680 --> 39:16.840
I figured I have to crack this nut.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.800
And I figured the robe would be a learning experience.

39:18.800 --> 39:22.420
I'd jump into the deep end and I'd learn a lot from it.

39:22.420 --> 39:24.200
And I did learn a lot.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.640
But one of the core lessons that I took away

39:26.640 --> 39:29.200
is that theme of the day is be humble.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.840
I have to start humble with something like this.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.680
I went into the deep end with a robe

39:32.680 --> 39:34.740
and that was such a bad idea.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.480
If it's gonna be something that becomes part

39:36.480 --> 39:39.080
of the business long-term, I need to start small

39:39.080 --> 39:40.380
and then I have to grow it

39:40.380 --> 39:42.840
and I have to learn as it grows.

39:42.840 --> 39:47.160
I have to build on small success after small success.

39:47.160 --> 39:50.880
So I've been thinking a lot about how to get this right.

39:50.880 --> 39:53.640
Because I think swag and merchandise

39:53.640 --> 39:56.580
is gonna be a fun part of the business.

39:56.580 --> 39:57.880
It's gonna be something that we can,

39:57.880 --> 40:00.080
we're gonna, I'm gonna, I wanna do limited stuff

40:00.080 --> 40:02.880
like name brand stuff and items that you'd actually

40:02.880 --> 40:04.920
wanna buy and just wear in general

40:04.920 --> 40:07.000
or things and gadgets that you'd wanna pick up

40:07.000 --> 40:10.600
or used items here at the studio that we're done with

40:10.600 --> 40:13.160
that are still great, still fully functional

40:13.160 --> 40:15.180
but we just need something maybe that has more ports

40:15.180 --> 40:17.880
or does more channels, that kind of stuff.

40:17.880 --> 40:21.200
I wanna have a business that can accommodate all of that.

40:21.200 --> 40:24.880
So I'm a little nervous to do this

40:24.880 --> 40:29.200
because I think this could be bad or this could be great

40:29.200 --> 40:31.380
but I have an announcement to make today.

40:32.320 --> 40:36.440
I am launching the Jupiter Broadcasting Garage sale

40:36.440 --> 40:38.740
at JupiterGarage.com.

40:38.740 --> 40:41.440
I am launching JupiterGarage.com today

40:41.440 --> 40:44.920
at JupiterGarage.com, go check it out.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.240
Let the fireworks go, go ahead, I know,

40:47.240 --> 40:49.720
I know, it's exciting, I know, yeah.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.920
I don't think you should be selling those to kids.

40:51.920 --> 40:56.220
Yeah, no, I know but they do so good with the fire.

40:56.220 --> 40:57.600
You know, they're responsible.

40:57.600 --> 41:01.320
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, that got close.

41:01.320 --> 41:05.540
So here's what I'm doing is I have a selection right now

41:05.540 --> 41:09.380
of mostly used hardware items like a FreeNAS Mini,

41:09.380 --> 41:11.720
a mixer, a compressor, you know,

41:11.720 --> 41:13.440
gear that I think is really high-end and good

41:13.440 --> 41:14.960
but we just don't simply use anymore

41:14.960 --> 41:17.200
and instead of throwing it out,

41:17.200 --> 41:18.760
I'm gonna sell it for really crazy,

41:18.760 --> 41:20.720
stupid, ridiculous prices.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.480
Really stupid, crazy low prices

41:22.480 --> 41:23.640
just to clear out the space

41:23.640 --> 41:25.800
because I wanna make room for the new.

41:25.800 --> 41:27.320
For the new stuff that I wanna do,

41:27.320 --> 41:29.140
the new swag items, the new merchandise,

41:29.140 --> 41:32.560
the new stickers, getting ready for events to come back

41:32.560 --> 41:35.840
and I wanna stock swag for booths and that kind of stuff.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.240
And the way to do that is to get rid of this stuff

41:38.240 --> 41:40.120
that I've been stockpiling forever.

41:40.120 --> 41:43.040
And there's things in there that still work totally good

41:43.040 --> 41:46.200
that are great items that I've always kept just in case

41:46.200 --> 41:48.280
but I really shouldn't be, I'm just hoarding.

41:48.280 --> 41:51.560
And I'm just kind of creating the garage experience,

41:51.560 --> 41:56.080
the garage sale experience but online at jupitergarage.com

41:56.080 --> 41:57.720
with the goal to make room for the new

41:57.720 --> 42:00.680
and honestly, quite frankly with you guys,

42:00.680 --> 42:01.760
total transparency here.

42:01.760 --> 42:05.360
I just need practice boxing, shipping, the whole thing.

42:05.360 --> 42:08.500
Like I gotta learn all of this and I need space.

42:08.500 --> 42:11.240
I need space but here's what I'm gonna do.

42:11.240 --> 42:12.600
So go to jupitergarage.com,

42:12.600 --> 42:14.480
look at some of the items I have there.

42:14.480 --> 42:16.960
If you're buying one of the used items,

42:16.960 --> 42:18.740
as space and weight allows,

42:18.740 --> 42:21.880
I'm gonna stash random retro swag items in those orders.

42:21.880 --> 42:24.560
Like just as I can, I'm gonna just throw some stickers

42:24.560 --> 42:25.520
in there or something like that

42:25.520 --> 42:28.880
or I might wrap a device in a shirt or something like that.

42:28.880 --> 42:29.920
Just sort of close your eyes

42:29.920 --> 42:32.400
and grab something at the studio, put it in the box.

42:32.400 --> 42:33.400
Throw it in the box.

42:33.400 --> 42:34.800
As long as it's not Levi.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.000
Right, no.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.640
But you know what I figured too,

42:37.640 --> 42:40.780
because I found a couple of caches of retro swag

42:40.780 --> 42:43.000
and I'm not making any more of this stuff.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.700
If you just want a random bag of retro swag,

42:46.700 --> 42:48.760
I'm gonna make that available too.

42:48.760 --> 42:49.920
They're going on sale right now.

42:49.920 --> 42:52.660
They're gonna normally be $25 for a bag of swag

42:52.660 --> 42:54.320
but right now, to kick off the new thing,

42:54.320 --> 42:57.040
they're gonna be $15 and I only have

42:57.040 --> 42:58.020
a small handful available.

42:58.020 --> 42:59.160
I'm doing limited quantities

42:59.160 --> 43:01.000
so that way I don't get inundated with orders

43:01.000 --> 43:02.960
and I make sure we get them out the door

43:02.960 --> 43:05.260
and that we're getting the shipping estimates right

43:05.260 --> 43:06.720
and that if somebody orders international,

43:06.720 --> 43:09.320
we can fulfill it and I'm literally learning

43:09.320 --> 43:10.920
with each one of these orders.

43:10.920 --> 43:14.720
So not only are you gonna make a very small

43:14.720 --> 43:16.200
financial contribution to the network

43:16.200 --> 43:18.240
and get yourself some gear or some swag

43:18.240 --> 43:20.620
but you are basically sending me through bootcamp

43:20.620 --> 43:22.280
to learn how to do this

43:22.280 --> 43:24.160
and we're kind of accomplishing something together.

43:24.160 --> 43:25.760
I'm clearing out some stuff here.

43:25.760 --> 43:27.400
This gear that's still perfectly usable,

43:27.400 --> 43:29.800
I'm pounding it on to make sure it works and stuff.

43:29.800 --> 43:32.200
It's getting a new home and I'm learning

43:32.200 --> 43:35.060
how to basically grow a new part of my business

43:35.060 --> 43:38.000
that will be independent of sponsorships

43:38.000 --> 43:40.200
or memberships or anything like that.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.080
Although that said, with the memberships,

43:42.080 --> 43:44.920
going forward, right now these prices are stupid.

43:44.920 --> 43:46.140
Like you wouldn't believe what I'm charging

43:46.140 --> 43:47.480
for a free NAS Mini.

43:47.480 --> 43:49.440
There's no discounts because the prices,

43:49.440 --> 43:52.180
they are ridiculous but going forward in the future,

43:52.180 --> 43:54.680
I will make a standard discount available

43:54.680 --> 43:55.900
for all of our members.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.160
So if you're an unplugged core contributor,

43:58.160 --> 44:01.040
you're gonna get 15% off every order

44:01.040 --> 44:03.620
and you'll have more information about that soon.

44:03.620 --> 44:05.040
That's true for all of our patrons

44:05.040 --> 44:07.200
and for members of any show of ours.

44:07.200 --> 44:09.640
You're gonna get 15% off any of your orders

44:09.640 --> 44:12.020
from the Jupiter Garage in the future.

44:12.020 --> 44:14.100
Right now, as I'm learning how to do this

44:14.100 --> 44:17.200
and I'm probably gonna be on the other end of profit,

44:17.200 --> 44:18.300
I'm gonna be paying out of pocket

44:18.300 --> 44:20.160
for some of this stuff as I learn it.

44:20.160 --> 44:21.200
I just can't do a discount

44:21.200 --> 44:23.180
because there's no discount to give

44:23.180 --> 44:25.320
but there will be one in the future for all of our members

44:25.320 --> 44:27.680
because my intention long-term will be

44:27.680 --> 44:30.200
to clear out some of this limited time swag that we have

44:30.200 --> 44:31.360
to get some hardware out there.

44:31.360 --> 44:33.360
There's a lot more hardware than what's on there right now

44:33.360 --> 44:35.760
so there's gonna be more stuff landing.

44:35.760 --> 44:39.000
And then kind of transition to create an inventory space

44:39.000 --> 44:41.420
for new original high quality merchandise,

44:41.420 --> 44:44.840
stuff that isn't just the standard fulfillment T-shirt

44:44.840 --> 44:45.680
or something like that.

44:45.680 --> 44:47.080
I mean, I will still do those from time to time

44:47.080 --> 44:48.280
because who doesn't like a T-shirt?

44:48.280 --> 44:51.360
And there is a T-shirt with the bearded tux

44:51.360 --> 44:55.680
holding the Jupiter rocket in a nice kind of low key

44:56.600 --> 44:58.640
gray and white on black.

44:58.640 --> 45:00.660
That's available in the garage sale right now

45:00.660 --> 45:03.120
as well as a hat that has the same bearded tux logo on it

45:03.120 --> 45:04.620
because that's my favorite tux.

45:04.620 --> 45:06.140
So there are a couple of those items

45:06.140 --> 45:09.140
that I'll do from time to time but my goal is

45:09.140 --> 45:12.180
I'm eventually gonna have an entire wardrobe of this stuff

45:12.180 --> 45:14.260
because I wanna get stuff that I wanna wear

45:14.260 --> 45:16.000
and when I start rolling that stuff out,

45:16.000 --> 45:19.220
we'll start doing discounts for members more on the regular.

45:19.220 --> 45:22.100
And that's gonna be more as my confidence grows

45:22.100 --> 45:24.820
as I know what I'm doing and I know I can tell somebody

45:24.820 --> 45:26.580
that you're gonna pay this for international shipping

45:26.580 --> 45:29.100
or you're gonna pay this if you live in California,

45:29.100 --> 45:30.920
you're gonna pay this if you live in Canada.

45:30.920 --> 45:33.780
When I get to that point and we're actually getting there,

45:33.780 --> 45:35.900
then you'll start seeing more stuff roll out.

45:35.900 --> 45:38.100
That's just sort of as I learn more.

45:38.100 --> 45:40.900
I'm gonna take it one small part at a time

45:40.900 --> 45:42.860
but there's always gonna be that core part

45:42.860 --> 45:46.040
of the Jupiter garage that will be items from the studio

45:46.040 --> 45:49.580
that we're done with, stuff that is still functional

45:49.580 --> 45:51.480
and we don't buy crap.

45:51.480 --> 45:53.700
So stuff that's good and functional

45:53.700 --> 45:56.380
but we're just done with it, we've outgrown it.

45:56.380 --> 45:58.660
That's gonna be always a part of the Jupiter garage

45:58.660 --> 46:00.860
and my intention there is just sell it,

46:00.860 --> 46:02.220
not really at much of a profit,

46:02.220 --> 46:05.800
maybe just make 20 bucks or something off of it really

46:05.800 --> 46:07.980
and let you have something that we're done with

46:07.980 --> 46:09.020
instead of letting it sit and rot

46:09.020 --> 46:11.140
like it does now in a closet or in the garage.

46:11.140 --> 46:12.740
Plus we gotta make room for beer.

46:12.740 --> 46:16.060
Yeah Wes, that is actually part of this.

46:16.060 --> 46:19.580
When we decided well we're gonna have a beer keg

46:19.580 --> 46:20.900
and we're gonna have a beer keg fridge

46:20.900 --> 46:22.600
and we're gonna have a spot to brew beer,

46:22.600 --> 46:24.140
we gotta have room.

46:24.140 --> 46:26.020
And we retire stuff from time to time

46:26.020 --> 46:27.020
that's still perfectly good.

46:27.020 --> 46:29.620
It doesn't make any sense that it just sits around in waste.

46:29.620 --> 46:30.920
Could go out to an audience member,

46:30.920 --> 46:32.820
they could help support the network a little bit.

46:32.820 --> 46:34.740
Yeah, who wouldn't wanna connect to the mumble room

46:34.740 --> 46:37.300
with a previously used Jupiter broadcasting audio gear,

46:37.300 --> 46:38.460
right, I mean come on.

46:38.460 --> 46:41.260
That's pretty much it.

46:41.260 --> 46:43.220
So there's a selection of stuff there.

46:43.220 --> 46:44.980
There will be more from time to time.

46:44.980 --> 46:48.840
Go to JupiterGarage.com to go see what's there now.

46:48.840 --> 46:53.840
And we have gone through our closets.

46:54.580 --> 46:58.040
Angela just found a huge stash of stickers

46:58.040 --> 47:01.380
that will be slipping into rando swag bags

47:01.380 --> 47:03.380
and orders that people place.

47:03.380 --> 47:07.060
And I found a stash of last challenge coins.

47:07.060 --> 47:10.040
And then independently there's some really nice

47:10.040 --> 47:14.020
retro last swag like the zip up hoodies

47:14.020 --> 47:16.880
with the classic bearded logo and stuff like that

47:16.880 --> 47:18.980
that will be going up for sale soon too.

47:18.980 --> 47:20.140
As we just kind of go through

47:20.140 --> 47:22.060
and make sure everything that's been in storage

47:22.060 --> 47:23.100
is still in good shape.

47:23.100 --> 47:25.540
And then we're gonna box it up and get shipping prices

47:25.540 --> 47:27.820
that make it available at the garage sale.

47:27.820 --> 47:28.860
That's the plan.

47:28.860 --> 47:30.700
And then over time I hope to grow that

47:30.700 --> 47:32.900
into kind of an arm of the business

47:32.900 --> 47:34.860
that will be part of sponsorships, memberships,

47:34.860 --> 47:38.480
and swag that is swag like nobody else is doing.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.380
It's not just boring stuff, but it's stuff

47:40.380 --> 47:43.380
that you could eventually end up buying.

47:43.380 --> 47:44.700
One of the things that's on there right now

47:44.700 --> 47:47.980
is the mixer I used for years of remote productions.

47:47.980 --> 47:49.140
And it's perfectly good.

47:49.140 --> 47:51.020
And it's got, I tell you what I love about it too.

47:51.020 --> 47:54.980
Like it's got, you can run it all off nine volt batteries.

47:54.980 --> 47:58.020
So if you have noisy audio, if you have line noise

47:58.020 --> 47:59.860
on your electrics and you want a mixer

47:59.860 --> 48:03.500
that's battery powered, this is like the total ultimate hack

48:03.500 --> 48:05.700
to avoiding line noise is run a battery powered mixer.

48:05.700 --> 48:07.540
And I used it for years on the road.

48:07.540 --> 48:09.220
It's still perfectly functional.

48:09.220 --> 48:11.100
I just now do all that stuff in Jack

48:11.100 --> 48:14.460
and don't need a mixer anymore, but it still works.

48:14.460 --> 48:16.740
And it's up on the garage sale.

48:16.740 --> 48:19.740
I'm very excited about it as you can probably tell.

48:19.740 --> 48:23.180
And I've been going on and on about it for weeks to Wes.

48:23.180 --> 48:24.020
Just a bit.

48:25.340 --> 48:26.740
So thanks for putting up with it, Wes.

48:26.740 --> 48:27.560
I appreciate it.

48:27.560 --> 48:29.640
There really is a lot of good gear that's been in there.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.540
And especially as the setup all pivoted

48:32.540 --> 48:34.960
to like Linux focus to more professional stuff

48:34.960 --> 48:36.960
or just more channels we needed to set up

48:36.960 --> 48:38.340
the studio right to have guests

48:38.340 --> 48:40.460
and get all the crazy Jack stuff going on.

48:40.460 --> 48:41.760
There's just a lot of good gear

48:41.760 --> 48:45.180
and other awesome items from history that, as you said,

48:45.180 --> 48:46.780
it really would be a shame to just see them

48:46.780 --> 48:48.740
rot away on the shelves when we're not using them.

48:48.740 --> 48:50.460
Yeah, grab a bit of JB history

48:50.460 --> 48:53.220
and stuff that you could use to make content

48:53.220 --> 48:55.340
or run right now and the chat room's right.

48:55.340 --> 48:57.740
I need to update the website with links and stuff.

48:57.740 --> 48:59.620
I just been getting it all going today

48:59.620 --> 49:01.380
and wanted to have it ready for the show,

49:01.380 --> 49:05.540
but I am often just the worst at that.

49:05.540 --> 49:09.780
I really need, the whole JB website needs a refresh

49:09.780 --> 49:11.560
because my intention was to have it replaced by now,

49:11.560 --> 49:12.660
but that never came around.

49:12.660 --> 49:15.860
And now it needs a refresh.

49:15.860 --> 49:18.100
And links to stuff like this need to happen.

49:18.100 --> 49:19.260
So hopefully that'll get done soon.

49:19.260 --> 49:23.440
But in the meantime, just go to jupytergarage.com for that.

49:25.060 --> 49:27.580
Well, Wes, that is the no-show.

49:27.580 --> 49:29.940
That's the unplanned show that we had today.

49:29.940 --> 49:31.300
It's almost a show.

49:31.300 --> 49:32.900
It was kind of a show, I think, actually.

49:32.900 --> 49:34.700
I think we just accidentally had a show.

49:34.700 --> 49:35.540
Whoopsie.

49:35.540 --> 49:36.540
I know.

49:36.540 --> 49:39.020
If anything we covered today interests you,

49:39.020 --> 49:41.980
then go check us out at linuxunplugged.com

49:41.980 --> 49:46.260
and get the links at linuxunplugged.com slash 401.

49:46.260 --> 49:48.240
You heard really briefly there from the orange one.

49:48.240 --> 49:51.140
He was just recently featured in the self-hosted podcast

49:51.140 --> 49:51.980
with his setup.

49:51.980 --> 49:54.140
You can find that at selfhosted.show.

49:54.140 --> 49:55.820
Hosting things like your own email server

49:55.820 --> 49:57.420
is the core of what we talk about there.

49:57.420 --> 49:59.660
So if you like that, go check that out.

49:59.660 --> 50:00.700
If you do the Twitter thing,

50:00.700 --> 50:03.980
you can follow this here podcast at Linux Unplugged.

50:03.980 --> 50:05.740
The network is at Jupyter Signal.

50:05.740 --> 50:08.140
And the whole gosh darn podcasting network

50:08.140 --> 50:11.220
is over there at Jupyterbroadcasting.com.

50:11.220 --> 50:14.300
And last but not least, may I just say,

50:14.300 --> 50:17.340
hmm, if I don't say so myself,

50:17.340 --> 50:20.180
picture me like a chicken who's like, you know,

50:20.180 --> 50:21.700
fluffing up his feathers right now

50:21.700 --> 50:23.980
and like getting braggadocious, but-

50:23.980 --> 50:26.500
I'm also picturing high-waisted pants for some reason.

50:26.500 --> 50:28.980
Yeah, and maybe some glasses.

50:28.980 --> 50:30.860
But gosh darn it,

50:30.860 --> 50:32.500
if I'm not just getting more and more proud

50:32.500 --> 50:34.580
of that Linux action news over there,

50:34.580 --> 50:37.100
if you work in the industry, don't miss Linux action news.

50:37.100 --> 50:39.060
Every Monday morning, Wes and I break down

50:39.060 --> 50:41.660
everything that matters in the world of Linux.

50:41.660 --> 50:44.300
And something you don't know by listening to the show,

50:44.300 --> 50:47.100
but something I want to tell you is,

50:47.100 --> 50:50.220
Wes and I put a lot of effort and thought into

50:50.220 --> 50:54.020
how can we say something concisely, efficiently,

50:54.020 --> 50:56.020
and so that it's easy to understand.

50:56.020 --> 50:58.660
And we try to get you all of the news you need to know

50:58.660 --> 51:00.300
in less than 30 minutes.

51:00.300 --> 51:03.780
And we pride ourselves on delivery in a way

51:03.780 --> 51:06.420
that is understandable, processable,

51:06.420 --> 51:09.900
with the context that you need, that doesn't drag on.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.900
And so there's a lot of stuff

51:11.900 --> 51:13.740
that doesn't make it into this show,

51:13.740 --> 51:15.180
otherwise this would be like a two-hour show.

51:15.180 --> 51:17.980
And those stories and that information,

51:17.980 --> 51:20.420
like the recent ports to the M1 platform,

51:20.420 --> 51:22.940
we went and got quotes from Hector Martin.

51:22.940 --> 51:24.860
We reached out to Hector Martin for contact

51:24.860 --> 51:25.780
and we bring that into the show.

51:25.780 --> 51:28.380
And that's another thing we do with Linux action news,

51:28.380 --> 51:30.980
is the stories are sourced.

51:30.980 --> 51:33.180
We try to contact the people behind the stories,

51:33.180 --> 51:34.220
the people writing the stories.

51:34.220 --> 51:36.580
We try to get their takes and that information.

51:36.580 --> 51:38.220
We incorporate that into the show,

51:38.220 --> 51:39.260
either by what we say,

51:39.260 --> 51:41.740
or sometimes we'll play the audio directly from them.

51:41.740 --> 51:44.060
And that's a special kind of effort

51:44.060 --> 51:47.140
that we spend the last half of our week doing

51:47.140 --> 51:49.140
to make Linux action news special

51:49.140 --> 51:51.580
and to have information that perhaps you're not hearing

51:51.580 --> 51:53.300
or reading in other places.

51:53.300 --> 51:54.500
Yeah, save yourself the time.

51:54.500 --> 51:57.420
Stop clicking through the clickbait in our Linux.

51:57.420 --> 51:59.980
Just head over to linuxactionnews.com.

51:59.980 --> 52:01.220
That's good, Wes.

52:01.220 --> 52:02.380
That is a, that's good.

52:02.380 --> 52:05.340
Well, this year podcast, it's gonna be live next week.

52:05.340 --> 52:06.900
Even when we say it's not gonna be live,

52:06.900 --> 52:08.060
sometimes it's live.

52:08.060 --> 52:09.380
See you next week.

52:09.380 --> 52:11.940
Same bat time, same bat station.

52:11.940 --> 52:14.180
So keep the Linux rolling and make it a Linux Tuesday.

52:14.180 --> 52:18.140
Join us live, 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

52:18.140 --> 52:19.700
Links to everything we talked about today,

52:19.700 --> 52:23.460
how to contact us, our mumble server, our matrix info,

52:23.460 --> 52:24.740
that's all over there,

52:24.740 --> 52:27.500
including subscribe links for RSS feeds, et cetera,

52:27.500 --> 52:32.500
at linuxunplugged.com and get all of it over there.

52:32.500 --> 52:34.220
Go get your links, go get your show notes,

52:34.220 --> 52:39.220
and then go check out the garage sale at jupytergarage.com.

52:39.220 --> 52:42.740
It's brand new, and I'm going to school,

52:42.740 --> 52:44.860
and you can help teach me a lesson or two.

52:44.860 --> 52:47.740
Thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode

52:47.740 --> 52:49.140
of the Unplugged program,

52:49.140 --> 52:55.140
and we'll see you right back here next Tuesday!

53:19.140 --> 53:32.420
JBtitles.com, let's go name this thing.

53:32.420 --> 53:34.500
Did you guys see that the GNOME project

53:34.500 --> 53:38.900
is considering moving the top bar to the bottom

53:38.900 --> 53:41.860
and creating kind of a layout similar to Chrome OS?

53:41.860 --> 53:42.860
Yeah.

53:42.860 --> 53:43.860
What?

53:43.860 --> 53:44.860
I really hope not.

53:44.860 --> 53:45.860
Really?

53:45.860 --> 53:46.860
Really?

53:46.860 --> 53:47.860
It reminds me too much of Windows

53:47.860 --> 53:48.860
and then also obviously Chrome.

53:48.860 --> 53:52.020
It's like that normally sort of looks unique right now.

53:52.020 --> 53:55.420
I think that's precisely why they're considering doing it,

53:55.420 --> 53:58.580
because it looks like Windows.

53:58.580 --> 53:59.740
Back end of last year,

53:59.740 --> 54:03.140
I think it was probably around October, November time,

54:03.140 --> 54:07.300
the GNOME Foundation had like a show and tell

54:07.300 --> 54:09.720
based on some user accessibility testing

54:09.720 --> 54:10.940
that they'd commissioned.

54:10.940 --> 54:14.720
So this was putting GNOME and other operating systems

54:14.720 --> 54:17.580
in front of a random selection of people

54:17.580 --> 54:20.180
or a selection of people with different backgrounds

54:20.180 --> 54:24.180
and different computing backgrounds and what have you.

54:24.180 --> 54:27.340
And it was GNOME as it was,

54:27.340 --> 54:32.500
what was slated to be at the time GNOME 40

54:32.500 --> 54:39.220
and also including stuff like the endless OS spin

54:39.220 --> 54:43.620
on how the GNOME desktop is presented.

54:43.620 --> 54:45.920
And long story short,

54:45.920 --> 54:50.100
those people that are not already familiar with GNOME

54:50.100 --> 54:56.940
gravitated towards the intuitive nature of using endless OS

54:56.940 --> 55:01.300
because it had a lot of similarity with Windows,

55:01.300 --> 55:02.720
which is what they knew.

55:02.720 --> 55:06.460
This is a point that I had a conversation with Neil McGovern,

55:06.460 --> 55:07.460
you know, the executive director.

55:07.460 --> 55:08.460
Yes, exactly.

55:08.460 --> 55:09.460
And he said, yeah,

55:09.460 --> 55:11.300
that when people use more traditional UI paradigms,

55:11.300 --> 55:12.660
they got to work faster basically.

55:12.660 --> 55:13.660
Yeah.

55:13.660 --> 55:17.060
You know, those traditional patterns didn't come out of nowhere.

55:17.060 --> 55:20.800
You know, they're through long established design research

55:20.800 --> 55:22.600
and human interaction research.

55:22.600 --> 55:28.080
So it was no mistake that GNOME looked a lot like Windows 95

55:28.080 --> 55:33.780
and Windows 95 had shared some familiar patterns with Mac OS.

55:33.780 --> 55:36.860
All of those were influenced by the same design research

55:36.860 --> 55:38.380
and design thinking.

55:38.380 --> 55:40.500
Which shared some design patterns honestly with Xerox.

55:40.500 --> 55:41.500
I mean, really.

55:41.500 --> 55:42.500
Indeed.

55:42.500 --> 55:43.500
Indeed.

55:43.500 --> 55:44.940
I mean, it does go back a long way.

55:44.940 --> 55:46.780
It goes back to the 1960s.

55:46.780 --> 55:50.060
But this is, you know, well-researched,

55:50.060 --> 55:53.020
well-funded research that goes back a long way.

55:53.020 --> 55:57.100
So I am not surprised to learn that GNOME are taking that

55:57.100 --> 56:00.880
feedback on board and looking to,

56:00.880 --> 56:03.900
I'm not going to say roll back necessarily, but you know,

56:03.900 --> 56:07.500
there is some sort of stepping away from the path they've been

56:07.500 --> 56:11.020
on to responding to user feedback.

56:11.020 --> 56:14.940
And user feedback is what people are familiar with is comfortable

56:14.940 --> 56:15.940
and intuitive.

56:15.940 --> 56:16.940
Yeah.

56:16.940 --> 56:19.540
I wonder how, I mean, I'm pretty flexible.

56:19.540 --> 56:21.860
I could probably roll with whatever.

56:21.860 --> 56:25.820
But it would be a change, you know, there's forever, I mean,

56:25.820 --> 56:28.300
with GNOME, I've always had a lot of my items up in a top bar

56:28.300 --> 56:29.300
in one way or another.

56:29.300 --> 56:31.100
It'd be a pretty significant shift for them.

56:31.100 --> 56:33.120
Yeah, but what about that mouse travel though?

56:33.120 --> 56:35.260
That's the part I've seen people kind of talking about the most

56:35.260 --> 56:36.260
I think.

56:36.260 --> 56:37.260
Yeah.

56:37.260 --> 56:38.260
Yeah.

56:38.260 --> 56:39.260
I just use the keyboard for everything.

56:39.260 --> 56:40.260
Yeah, exactly.

56:40.260 --> 56:41.980
Nobody knows which buttons to push now.

56:41.980 --> 56:43.460
Yeah, exactly.

56:43.460 --> 56:46.060
So Wimpy, the Ubuntu podcast is back.

56:46.060 --> 56:47.300
It's active.

56:47.300 --> 56:48.300
What else is going on?

56:48.300 --> 56:49.300
How are you?

56:49.300 --> 56:50.300
I'm very well.

56:50.300 --> 56:53.700
I hear that everyone else is very well too.

56:53.700 --> 56:54.700
Yeah.

56:54.700 --> 56:55.700
Yeah.

56:55.700 --> 56:59.980
You know, he didn't stop by the show today, but a friend of the

56:59.980 --> 57:03.860
show, Popeye has recently left Canonical as well.

57:03.860 --> 57:08.420
So both of you now have left the Canonical mothership, but I

57:08.420 --> 57:10.420
assume for greener pastures.

57:10.420 --> 57:11.420
Yeah.

57:11.420 --> 57:14.940
Obviously, I have been at Slim now for like five weeks.

57:14.940 --> 57:16.340
I think I've been working there.

57:16.340 --> 57:17.380
So I'm doing my thing.

57:17.380 --> 57:19.140
Don't think Popeye's left Canonical yet.

57:19.140 --> 57:22.660
He's announced that he will be leaving.

57:22.660 --> 57:27.460
A bit like I did, I announced my plans to leave ahead of time to

57:27.460 --> 57:33.660
give people in the community who may have wanted some final stuff,

57:33.660 --> 57:37.580
you know, from me, time to contact me and round that out and Popeye's

57:37.580 --> 57:38.580
done the same.

57:38.580 --> 57:41.220
So, yeah, Popeye's off to something new.

57:41.220 --> 57:43.020
I'm not going to disclose what that is.

57:43.020 --> 57:45.380
He'll do that, you know, when the time is right for him.

57:45.380 --> 57:46.380
But yeah.

57:46.380 --> 57:48.220
Well, Popeye, if you're out there listening, you are welcome to join

57:48.220 --> 57:52.180
us when your last day arrives and you want to come and hang out with

57:52.180 --> 57:53.180
your buddies.

57:53.180 --> 57:54.420
What I will say is this.

57:54.420 --> 57:58.180
Some people have reacted to, you know, there are some people that

57:58.180 --> 58:02.100
maybe only know about Alan and I and our association with Ubuntu and

58:02.100 --> 58:05.120
Canonical and the fact that we've both left recently.

58:05.120 --> 58:07.460
They see as the sky is falling.

58:07.460 --> 58:08.700
That's not the case.

58:08.700 --> 58:14.700
And perhaps, you know, the silver lining to this is maybe the two of us,

58:14.700 --> 58:19.300
you know, old and grizzled, you know, people from, you know, Ubuntu

58:19.300 --> 58:25.340
leaving is a good thing because there is, you know, a vibrant new life

58:25.340 --> 58:30.580
at Canonical who are spearheading community engagement now with, you

58:30.580 --> 58:33.180
know, Monica and Reese.

58:33.180 --> 58:37.020
And this is their opportunity to take things in new and interesting

58:37.020 --> 58:38.020
directions.

58:38.020 --> 58:42.660
So I don't think people should be interpreting this as, you know, a

58:42.660 --> 58:43.660
negative thing.

58:43.660 --> 58:48.260
But the opportunity for a new era of, you know, Ubuntu community to

58:48.260 --> 58:49.260
shine and blossom.

58:49.260 --> 58:50.260
I like it.

58:50.260 --> 59:10.780
And I hope so, too.
