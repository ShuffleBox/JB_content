1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Did you know that researchers are now putting fish into augmented reality tanks?

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,800
That's right, AR for fish.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,400
I love it.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,000
You're telling me I can get a fish tank that's not real or the fish tank's real but the fish aren't.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,700
What part's the AR part?

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, so they've attached AR to the fish.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,300
They're trying to use it to study how the fish think they can hide.

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:23,400
So they're like recording what the fish sees and playing it back and tweaking it to see how the fish responds to different visual input.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,700
This is what we're spending our time on?

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,400
This is Linux Unplugged episode 282 for January 2nd, 2019.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:47,200
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's talking about fish this week.

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,100
My name is Chris.

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,900
My name is Wes.

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,900
And not the shell, not the shell, not yet at least, although they did have a new release.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,600
Sometime soon.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,900
Yeah, sometime soon we're going to have somebody on from the project and talk about the awesome fish shell.

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:01:00,300
But this, this episode, we're doing what I like to call a little hope casting.

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:09,500
If you had a magic wand bestowed upon you by the Linux Unplugged program and you could affect any change in the open source world in 2019, what would it be?

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:16,000
And to warm us up, we're going to look back at some of the major trends that really stood out from us throughout 2018 and talk about those things.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,800
The things that bent the open source world a little bit and changed the direction of things.

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,200
The things that really kind of stick out now that we're on the other end of it.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
And then that will inform our 2019 hope casting.

23
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,500
What do you think, Wes? That sound like fun to you?

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,200
That's a winning recipe.

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,600
Okay. Do you have a good holiday?

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,100
Oh, I had a wonderful holiday.

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,600
But we're back here at work because there's just so much awesome Linux news to talk about.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,800
That's true. We couldn't, we couldn't be away.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,700
Yeah, and I'm excited to hope cast, right?

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,300
There's a lot of good things that could happen and there's no ref on this episode.

31
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,900
We can say whatever we like.

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,100
This one's free wheeling.

33
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,200
Although we'll probably still hear from that ref if we get it wrong.

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,300
You know how that works.

35
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,000
All right, before we go any closer, let's bring in that virtual lug.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,300
Time, appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

37
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,500
Hello. Good morning.

38
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,400
Hello. Good morning. Good afternoon.

39
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,100
And like I always say, time approves.

40
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,000
That's just easier. The general catch-all.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,800
You know, I did say we're going to, we'll be doing our hope castings.

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,400
But I did have a little community news.

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,100
Originally, when we were planning this episode, I thought, oh, there's not going to be any news with the holidays.

44
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,100
Everyone's taking breaks.

45
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,500
Everybody's off. There's no open source getting made.

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,700
Turns out there's news.

47
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,700
Turns out there's news.

48
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:31,200
And the first news may actually, may be really good for me and my predictions that I made just last week.

49
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,400
You are getting lucky already.

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,700
I am actually doing quite well.

51
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,900
The first one was my Clear Linux prediction, which apparently, apparently the good folks over at Intel agreed with me.

52
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,100
And we have a pretty big update from Clear Linux this week.

53
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:54,400
The first is this, this sort of call-to-action blog post co-authored by Aiki and I'm going to say Oak.

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,300
I think you're right.

55
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:03,200
And they talk about the challenges they're trying to solve with their special get out of the way desktop version of Clear Linux.

56
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,600
That's ready for remote desktop, ready for performance.

57
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:15,200
Everything you need, just a single command away, optimized around a special built XFCE desktop.

58
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,400
Oh yeah, trim down, lean and mean.

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:26,700
With same defaults as they say, their philosophy is stateless and that is enshrined in their operating system.

60
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:34,900
They've also extended this to the visuals of the desktop using the beautiful Arc GTK theme with elementary XFCE icons

61
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:42,800
and made it ready for remote rendering to make sure that things like special gradients wouldn't be there to slow down the remote performance

62
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,700
and that OpenGL applications would work awesome.

63
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,700
This is a big push by Intel for Clear Linux to be a player on the desktop.

64
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,100
I don't know if it's going to be successful, but I like this angle.

65
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,300
I like the XFCE base for the desktop.

66
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:04,600
I like that they're focusing on running it in remote desktops, remote virtual desktops you might say, which was another prediction of mine.

67
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,900
Yeah, I can see it too.

68
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,300
I thought some of their verbiage around you're a grumpy old sys admin who just knows what a desktop should be

69
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,600
and doesn't need a newfangled thing on your server under the familiarity header.

70
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,400
That doesn't play well with me, but I can see it.

71
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,900
A simple thing that does work well in a virtualized environment if you're already using an operating system that basically targets that.

72
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, sometimes, especially if you're coming from the Windows world or you just want a GUI because using something to edit the partitions is just easier that way.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,800
What do you think, Popeye, of Intel's play here to base their Linux desktop around XFCE?

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,500
Clever?

75
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,300
I think it makes sense because you need something, especially for remote desktop.

76
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:55,900
You need something that's not got too many effects baked in and it's not too GPU heavy so that you can scale it up and have tons of these running on one machine if needed,

77
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,200
or you just want to have a super fast lightweight protocol between you and the remote machine, I guess.

78
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,500
Yeah, I agree.

79
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,700
I think it's cunning in a way that most people might go for flashy and name grabby,

80
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,700
and they went for tried true and honestly one of the better desktops for a remote session.

81
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,500
I'm really curious to see where Intel goes with this, and maybe it's me,

82
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,200
but I feel like I read kind of Aiki's language in this blog post a little bit.

83
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,700
I'll give you one of the lines that stands out as sort of an Aiki line to me.

84
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:35,400
When it comes specifically to targeting the developer or administrators, we see an entirely different set of challenges.

85
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,200
Many of us would like to simplify remote access from the desktop to our deployed machines to facilitate that efficient workflow.

86
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,900
As such, we took certain points into consideration when building the developer desktop experience.

87
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,100
Reminds me a lot of how he talked about projects in Solus.

88
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,000
Right, there's this idea of, well, of course, it should be done this way and just like do it right.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,400
You don't have to do everything.

90
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,100
Right.

91
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,900
And those are principles.

92
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,900
I mean, in general, I think.

93
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Yeah, he's usually right.

94
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,400
That was the thing about Aiki.

95
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,500
Yeah, that's fascinating.

96
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,400
And it was co-authored by him in this post.

97
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,500
So we'll be hearing a lot more, I think, from ClearLinux.

98
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,400
It'll be interesting to see how that evolves and actually how many people in the community pick it up.

99
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,800
Yeah.

100
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,500
And of course, the other big thing around ClearLinux is the gaming project.

101
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,500
The Steam project that Aiki had been working on, that he talked on the show about before, is being moved over to ClearLinux, it appears.

102
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,000
Did you see this?

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,800
No, I did not.

104
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,400
Yeah.

105
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,300
Yeah, that whole Steam compatibility thing that he was working on.

106
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,900
Popey, did you see this, that this is now a ClearLinux project?

107
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:34,300
Yeah, I saw it as a fork of it now under Aiki's new GitHub account.

108
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,800
Yeah.

109
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,300
Yeah.

110
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,300
Isn't that interesting?

111
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,000
I wonder how Solus...

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,400
I think I know how Solus feels about that, actually.

113
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,500
But yeah, I think I'll be watching this one, hoping that my predictions come true.

114
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,400
I mean, that's really all I...

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,000
That's the reason I...

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,600
Good luck to you.

117
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,100
I'm kind of tempted to try it, too.

118
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,700
If I can install Snaps.

119
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,900
Seriously.

120
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,300
Are Snaps available for ClearLinux?

121
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,200
Because...

122
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,800
Nope.

123
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,700
That makes it a lot harder to do the...

124
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,300
You know, some of those applications that I use for my job, they're in Snaps.

125
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Why would you want that on your professional workstation, Chris?

126
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't get that.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,700
Somebody ought to get on that.

128
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,200
All right.

129
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,900
Well, I know something else somebody ought to get on.

130
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,500
We got to get collective, and we got to make some collective action on this next story.

131
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:26,900
You're not going to believe this, but a port of the Riser 4 file system for Linux 4.20 is in the works.

132
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,400
His wife might be dead, but the file system in his name continues on.

133
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,200
There hasn't been a formal Riser 4 file system patch released since September,

134
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,500
when it was ported to the 4.18 kernel.

135
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,700
But via Git this week, there was a port for Linux 4.20 kernel,

136
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,000
should you want to utilize this once promising Riser file system.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,600
Yeah, that's right.

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Okay, so Edward Shishkin, he's the last main developer.

139
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,100
He's got his own kernel tree, and it's not actually released yet,

140
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,700
but there is a new branch with fixes, and they're not very many, honestly.

141
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,900
There hasn't been that many changes on the Riser side,

142
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,700
so there's not a lot of changes that you actually need here.

143
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,600
Yeah.

144
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,900
There's also a new branch for some upcoming feature work, volume-related fixes, balancing work, a new key allocation scheme.

145
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,100
So if you're a user, okay, maybe there's some good stuff happening, but why are you a user?

146
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,700
Legacy data, maybe?

147
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,700
But even then, like, get a new RAID setup and copy it over.

148
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,800
I don't know, really.

149
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,500
We have XFS, you'll be fine.

150
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,400
You know, that's sort of been the situation for years, though.

151
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,300
Like, some people are still using it, but you think about it.

152
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,100
We haven't seen Riser 4 mainlined in the Linux kernel in 2019.

153
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,800
We're not going to see it.

154
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
We haven't seen it yet.

155
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,300
It's not likely to happen in 2019.

156
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,900
Hey, that might be someone's hope cast.

157
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,300
Well, I'm going to say this right now.

158
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,900
Here's my pledge.

159
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,800
People speculate, people in the know, people familiar with the matter,

160
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,500
speculate that if a corporate backer were to come along and corporately back Riser,

161
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,600
whatever that means, like it's inclusion in the kernel or whatever, then it could be mainlined.

162
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,700
So I make this commitment right now.

163
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,400
If the audience can organize around this and form a company, I will fund it.

164
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll fund $2,000 of my own personal money.

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,800
If we could get Riser somehow mainlined in the Linux kernel,

166
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,500
it'd be the best thing this show ever did.

167
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,800
It would be amazing.

168
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,900
And what is corporate backing really, right?

169
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,800
Isn't that just a company that's willing to put their name on something and submit the patch and fight for it?

170
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,300
I mean, I don't know.

171
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,400
I think so.

172
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,800
We just got to get organized.

173
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,100
Maybe fund a little bit of development work if there's, you know, changes.

174
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,500
Sure, why not?

175
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:32,800
Sure.

176
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,800
If we got extra money after the pizza party, we form an LLC, right?

177
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,300
Something like Axe Murder File Systems Incorporated.

178
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,000
No, I don't know what we call it, but we form an LLC and we collectively raise some money.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,200
I'll seed it with $2,000 just to get this going.

180
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,700
We probably need to raise a little more than that.

181
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,000
And then we submit it to the kernel for inclusion.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
By the end of 2019, we get RiserFS mainlined.

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,500
I think it'd be a massive accomplishment.

184
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm just putting it out there.

185
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,600
It's for the audience to take and run with.

186
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,900
I'm just the idea guy.

187
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,000
But you let me know.

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,800
What do you think?

189
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,400
I think it's a great plan.

190
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Would you put in 10 bucks?

191
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,600
Oh, yes.

192
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,200
Of course.

193
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,900
For Linux?

194
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
Who wouldn't?

195
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,800
What a ridiculous accomplishment that would be.

196
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,500
Like if we somehow had managed to put together enough organization to...

197
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,300
Yeah, probably we should use that to fund other kernel features.

198
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,300
No, that's ridiculous.

199
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,800
This is important.

200
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
I mean, somebody's got to work on the important things.

201
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,100
Because companies like Google now are focusing on getting GPU support for their Linux apps running on Chrome OS.

202
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,300
This is massive.

203
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:42,600
Chrome OS is in the early stages right now of adding full-fledged graphics acceleration to the Linux apps.

204
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,500
They're necessary for not only running games, but some other important apps, too.

205
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,700
There's probably a few that come to mind.

206
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,600
Oh, yeah, that is right.

207
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Yeah, you can play non-intense games, a little bit of GPU work, things like that.

208
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,100
Sure.

209
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
But don't go crazy.

210
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,600
No.

211
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,000
And of course, especially these days, games aren't the only programs that actually use a GPU.

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,900
No, more so than ever.

213
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:08,900
Yeah, actually one major application that Google has been hard at work trying to perfect for Chrome OS is, of course, Android Studio.

214
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,400
That'd be good.

215
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,100
And while Android Studio itself can run on Chrome OS today through the Linux app support,

216
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,600
the Android emulator, which is used for testing all of your Android apps on a simulated device,

217
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
well, it needs the GPU.

218
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,300
It needs that GPU.

219
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,100
Yeah.

220
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,300
Yeah, so that's probably the main driver for this.

221
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,300
But we'll see.

222
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,300
It is in the source code management system now.

223
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:36,700
There is a new option to enable Linux GPU virtual machine acceleration, whatever they're calling it.

224
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,600
It's going to be in the beta channels, obviously.

225
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,900
But I don't think you're going to see a super easy user way to do this yet.

226
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,200
No, not so far.

227
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,900
You're going to have to go to the command line, run VMZ start, enable GPU.

228
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,400
There you go.

229
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,900
And then the application you want to enable.

230
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
That's not so bad.

231
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,000
And then eventually, they'll probably just turn it on automatically once they've got it nailed down.

232
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,400
The nice thing about Chrome OS, I suppose, is they've got kind of the Apple advantage.

233
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,300
They control the operating system.

234
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,700
And it's a range of devices, but it's a limited range.

235
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,500
It's not the entire marketplace they have to support.

236
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,600
It's devices that they've blessed to run Chrome OS.

237
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
So they, in theory, know the whole addressable market there.

238
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
And in somewhat of like an iOS, same thing.

239
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,200
Like, they're starting from a more limited platform of support, right?

240
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,900
Here's what our device does, and then adding things as they think it's up to stuff.

241
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Yeah, I wonder if that's 2019 might be the year I get a Chromebook, I think.

242
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,900
I've been pushing it.

243
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,900
But you've got full-fledged Linux apps on there with GPU support.

244
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,400
I got to at least try it, kind of see what it's like.

245
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Yeah, okay.

246
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,200
I'm curious, too.

247
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,800
Part of me is, you know, nervous that this is the Linux desktop.

248
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,600
Chrome OS is the Linux desktop.

249
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,300
What if you love it?

250
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,400
What if that's true?

251
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,100
Would you love it?

252
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,200
That'd be great, actually.

253
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,700
I'd be okay with that.

254
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,100
Brent, you didn't end up with any Chrome OS experiences on your recent travels.

255
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,200
Welcome back to the show, Brent.

256
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,100
It's good to have you back.

257
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,600
You must have had a mobile computing setup while you were traveling all around the world.

258
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,100
World traveling man, you are.

259
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,800
Yeah, thanks.

260
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,500
First of all, it's good to be back.

261
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,900
I got all set up yesterday and realized I was one day off.

262
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,900
Yeah, well, it's a special day today because of the holidays.

263
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:11,600
Yeah, I sort of brought my whole production machine down.

264
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,300
You did?

265
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,000
Wow.

266
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,100
Well, I was in Chile for like two and a half weeks or something like that doing some really

267
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
in-depth paragliding stuff.

268
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,100
My twin brother does that and I got a free opportunity to learn how to do it, which was

269
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,600
really great.

270
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
But I was also there with a camera.

271
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,000
So I was trying to capture a whole bunch of stuff that was going on.

272
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,200
And I just thought, if I'm going to try to be on assignment without my production machine,

273
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,000
it's a bit of a challenge.

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So I did break down and carried extra stuff and half regretted it because I had to haul

275
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,300
it all.

276
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,000
But no Chrome OS.

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
Sorry, no Chrome OS.

278
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,300
I bet more than half.

279
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

280
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,500
Well, I'm being generous.

281
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,000
I didn't know you had a twin brother either.

282
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,700
How do I know if I'm talking to real Brent or Brent's twin?

283
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,400
You know, it's strange.

284
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,900
So I'm visiting him in BC still at this point.

285
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,400
And I'm sitting at his desk and he has, of course, the exact same computer that I do

286
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,300
because I set him up with it.

287
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,400
So it's slowly stealing his identity.

288
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:06,900
Nice.

289
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,000
That's it, right?

290
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,400
Pretty soon I'll be driving his car.

291
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,300
Soon you'll be just as good of a paraglider.

292
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,100
If I had a twin brother, I'd keep it a secret.

293
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,800
And I would swap.

294
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,100
Like today, he'd be working, not me.

295
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,600
This week, it would be twin brothers week.

296
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,000
And I'd be off this week.

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,400
But I'd never tell anyone I was doing it.

298
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,100
You know?

299
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,900
So most of the time he spends like he's just having to learn, right?

300
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,100
You write down all the things you do.

301
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,000
Here's the new facts.

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
Well, we got to make sure we're eating the same stuff.

303
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,900
We got to buy two of everything.

304
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,600
I mean, it's not cheap, but I feel like it's worth the long game.

305
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,200
Have you tried?

306
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,100
Have you thought about it, Brent?

307
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,000
Have you tried that?

308
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,300
Well, here's a question for you, Chris.

309
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,700
How do you know it's not me?

310
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,500
How do you know it is me?

311
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,400
You're right.

312
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,100
I got you there.

313
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:43,900
OK.

314
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,400
Fair enough.

315
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,100
And you wouldn't say.

316
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,000
You wouldn't tell me, obviously, because I would ruin it.

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,800
Well, exactly.

318
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,000
All the benefits go away if you say something.

319
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,200
Now, let's say, you know, Richard Stallman comes down.

320
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,500
He says, you know what I want to do is I want to give you some of this free software foundation

321
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
money, you know?

322
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,200
Because, you know, what's he going to do with it?

323
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,300
So he writes you a big old check and says, here you go.

324
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,100
Here's $5,000, Brent.

325
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,200
I want you to modernize your mobile setup.

326
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,000
Where do you go with that $5,000?

327
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,900
Do you go, like, down the route of a ThinkPad?

328
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,600
Do you go down the route of a Chromebook?

329
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,100
Where would you go at this point?

330
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,400
So that's interesting, because when you were asking the question,

331
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,400
I thought it was like 5K to revolutionize the idea of a mobile setup.

332
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
But you're talking just 5K to purchase one.

333
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,000
If you had to go and get one today, because, you know, the reason why I ask you is,

334
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,200
man, I would be thinking that.

335
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,300
As I'm sitting there carrying all these heavy bags around and stuff,

336
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,700
like, what would be going through my head is how can I make this better?

337
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,300
This is the worst thing ever.

338
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,300
But I'm also a bit of a whiner.

339
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,700
It's funny.

340
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,100
This trip for me changed something in my mind.

341
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,000
And my number one change that I would love to see actually doesn't have anything to do

342
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,700
with my computer.

343
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,300
It would be a lighter, better camera.

344
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,100
Oh, sure.

345
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,800
And I think that might be a bit of my own limitation.

346
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I'm still using a DSLR, and they've got some wonderful mirrorless cameras and stuff out there.

347
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,300
So it's more about me having to buy something else and push the envelope in my own arena.

348
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,000
Right, I suppose that stuff's so heavy in comparison to your computer.

349
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,600
The computer stuff isn't that big of a deal.

350
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,300
That's it, right?

351
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,900
And the computer's slim, so you can shove it in a bag and it doesn't take up that much space.

352
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,300
But as far as the camera gear goes, you know, it generally has its own backpack or whatever, right?

353
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:17,800
Yeah.

354
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
But 5K won't do it, Chris.

355
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,600
5K won't do it in that arena.

356
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,400
No, that might get you a lens.

357
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,600
Yeah, that's a start.

358
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,800
Oh, boy.

359
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,600
Yeah, it's a totally different ballgame.

360
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Yeah, well, I guess we'll just have to wait and see if Richard Stallman comes and writes that check.

361
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,800
Because, yeah, you're right.

362
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,700
You could totally redo that whole setup if you're starting with the camera gear.

363
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,300
Yeah, that's it.

364
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,800
And so having invested so much into one system, it's always a little tricky to move, right?

365
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,600
And that's probably true of computers as well.

366
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:58,400
But to answer your original question, I would say, just very broadly, the thinnest, most Linux-friendly laptop I can possibly get that has an IPS screen and just gets out of the way.

367
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,000
Yeah, a nice screen is definitely important for what you're doing, too.

368
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
Well, glad to have you back.

369
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,700
And glad you enjoyed your travels.

370
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,100
Sounds like paragliding.

371
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,700
Sounds like quite the adventure.

372
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,500
With a twin brother?

373
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,100
I mean, that's a heck of a story.

374
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,100
You should be vlogging this.

375
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:13,800
I'd watch that.

376
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,100
I'd watch that.

377
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,500
You know, I'm not as sophisticated as you.

378
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,200
Maybe I'll start.

379
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,700
You should.

380
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:23,300
But I did throw up in the IRC a little gallery just so people can get a sense of what I was doing.

381
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,800
So almost all of those shots, at least the photos, are actually of me.

382
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,000
So there's me in the sky with birds and stuff like that.

383
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,600
It's really amazing.

384
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,700
And there's some cool videos there from an expert who knows a lot more than I do.

385
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,300
But basically, we're flying over the city and doing some really cool stuff.

386
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,400
So yeah, thanks for the interest there.

387
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,000
And for sure, I missed being plugged into JB for that time.

388
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,800
Plugged into Untucked.

389
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,000
It's good to have you back.

390
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,200
Well, why don't we do a little kind of looking forward now?

391
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Let's start shifting gears.

392
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,000
What we're gathered here for today, and let's start with Wine.

393
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,400
Wine is one of those projects that's been around forever now.

394
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,600
And they're aiming for their 4.0 release, which could be massive for them,

395
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,400
including a lot of the work with the DXVK stuff recently being moved back in.

396
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,500
Support for querying BIOS data on Linux, Kerberos authentication,

397
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,000
OpenGL core context being enabled in Direct3D, a bunch of Direct3D stuff

398
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,600
actually, including multi-threaded command streams, all kinds of good stuff.

399
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,400
So Wine, I think, this isn't a prediction.

400
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,700
I mean, just Wine with the recent Proton work and all this

401
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,500
is just going to have a fantastic 2019.

402
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:44,800
But just to kind of get us kicking, I think 2019 might be Gnome's year to lose.

403
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,400
So, you know, Gnome shipping on all major commercial and non-commercial Linux

404
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,600
distros right now.

405
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,100
But just looking at some benchmarks that Michael Larble posted on December 30th

406
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:02,900
over on Ferronics, impressively, Gnome has made significant performance

407
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,600
improvements over 2018.

408
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,500
And now at the beginning of 2019, in some benchmarks, is performing better

409
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:16,700
than MATE, LXQt, XFCE, and Plasma, even.

410
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,400
Not in all circumstances, and these are mainly GPU-bound tests.

411
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,200
Even in some circumstances under Wayland, it's under Wayland,

412
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,700
it's still performing better than those other desktops.

413
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,900
And this is undoubtedly due to work by a lot of great people on the Gnome project

414
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
and folks at Canonical, no question about it.

415
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,600
This has been a collective effort for them to improve the shell.

416
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,000
But we started out 2018 feeling pretty bad about where Gnome was at performance

417
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,500
wise, memory leaks.

418
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,100
I mean, the beginning of 2018, we're talking about memory leaks.

419
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,200
Now, they've closed that performance gap and even in some cases exceeded the

420
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,800
performance of the other desktops in certain types of tests.

421
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,200
We're not talking about like multi-threaded things, you know,

422
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,900
we're talking about certain types of GPU-bound tests.

423
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,100
So, it's really Gnome's year to lose over 2019 because they're addressing the

424
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,200
performance issue.

425
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,700
If they can start rebuilding parts of the shell over time, so we have…

426
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,500
That's the question right there is, okay, well, it's in an okay place.

427
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
I don't think…

428
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,400
There are questions about the future in 2019.

429
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,500
Can they keep up the same level of attention to detail, new features,

430
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,200
keeping things stable while going under a major re-architecture?

431
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,300
Yeah. All right. So, there you go.

432
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,900
In old school when we still had ads, that's what we call a tease.

433
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,400
I've never installed Gnome slash Linux.

434
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,300
Let's take a second here and do a little housekeeping and then we'll jump into

435
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
the year in review and the hope casting.

436
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,300
So, a couple of items I just want everybody listening to be aware of that

437
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,200
I think are important.

438
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,500
Just, I'll be gone for a little bit.

439
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,800
I'll be traveling down to Texas in the RV and on my way down,

440
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,300
stopping to get married and then honeymooning.

441
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,400
So, I'll be in and out in a way.

442
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,500
We've pre-recorded some great conversations that will be rolled into the show

443
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,800
while I'm not here.

444
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,900
And we also have some episodes that I'll be on while I'm on the road

445
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
and then there'll be some that I'm not on.

446
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,900
So, it's big, it's exciting and I also I'll be down in Texas.

447
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,400
We'll be doing a whole bunch of new content launches for Linux Academy.

448
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,300
Nice.

449
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,200
So, I'll be on the live streams doing that again.

450
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,800
Yeah, that's always a lot of fun.

451
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,800
And then yeah, flying to Cancun for part of that and doing the honeymoon thing too.

452
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,100
Oh, are you excited?

453
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
I am, I'm very excited.

454
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:35,600
And the, so on our way down to Texas, we're stopping in the Arizona desert in this spot.

455
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,100
It's called BLM Land, which is the Bureau of Land Management.

456
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,600
Right.

457
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
And it's kind of like no man's territory.

458
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,300
The federal government owns it and they just have nothing,

459
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,300
they have no use for it so they let you just camp on it for free.

460
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,200
Particular American West kind of problem.

461
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,100
It's so great.

462
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,000
It really is the best kind of problem.

463
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,400
And it's really, this area is really, really well known for its star watching.

464
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,600
So, we're going to do like a 5 a.m. in the front of the stars kind of thing.

465
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
That sounds beautiful.

466
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,100
Yeah, we're kind of hoping to track down a photographer in the area.

467
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,800
So, we'll see.

468
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,900
Oh, hey, my hands up.

469
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,000
Are you in Arizona though?

470
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,100
Bring it on.

471
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,900
I love it.

472
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,300
That's awesome.

473
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,400
So, we will have some stuff while I'm out.

474
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,900
So, I'll be in and out for a bit and doing that stuff down in Texas.

475
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,400
Going to live down in Texas for like three weeks basically, almost a month.

476
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,000
Just going to have Lady Joop's Park down at Linux Academy.

477
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,900
That is nice.

478
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,500
Yeah, this is the whole you live in an RV benefit.

479
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,000
Yeah, plus it's winter.

480
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,700
So, I'm cool getting out of here for a little while.

481
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
That's good.

482
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,900
Not that it's amazing in Texas, but it doesn't rain like it does here.

483
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,700
And then, of course, one more thing I want everyone to know about

484
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,500
is I'll be back before Linux Fest, but in April, it is Linux Fest.

485
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,200
I'll be back by around the end of January,

486
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,600
but April 26th to the 28th, 2019,

487
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,500
Bellingham Technical College in Washington State, Linux Fest Northwest,

488
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,400
20th anniversary of Linux Fest.

489
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,300
Yeah, you've heard us invite you to this before and extol the many,

490
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,000
but this is the year.

491
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,700
This is the one to go to.

492
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
It's going to be big.

493
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,000
So, that's about housekeeping I had for you.

494
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,300
I'm looking forward to my time on the road.

495
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,500
I will be popping in like when I'm in Texas.

496
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,600
I have a studio down there now, so I'll pop in and do the show thing and all that.

497
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
So, I won't be gone the entire time,

498
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,200
but there will be portions in January where I'm gone,

499
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,400
but the show will go on, LinuxUnplugged.com slash subscribe.

500
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,700
Now, before we go into 2019,

501
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,500
let's talk just a little bit about what stuck with us in 2018.

502
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,000
And I got a couple of things and we could toss them around,

503
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,200
but just one I bet we don't have a lot of commentary on,

504
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,900
but I think we'll always remember Meltdown was in 2018.

505
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,300
Meltdown and Spectre were a huge thing.

506
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,500
Yeah, remember when we found out that a lot of the recent designs of our CPUs

507
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,200
was just kind of fundamentally on sound?

508
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,600
Yeah.

509
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,300
That was great.

510
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:05,100
And even today, we are seeing articles published about the performance penalties.

511
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,300
I just saw an article about how Linux is particularly taking a penalty right now

512
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,100
in a particular area when you have a particular type of mitigation.

513
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,400
It's much worse than any of the other operating systems.

514
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,000
And they're scrambling to try to fix that.

515
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,500
And now we're in 2019.

516
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,700
So, I think that was pretty big.

517
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,900
But for me personally, in my Linux usage,

518
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,100
one of the biggest things that happened was the release of Ubuntu 18.04.

519
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,400
I rebased my whole studio on that.

520
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,000
And I rebased my workstations on that.

521
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,800
And some of the derivatives I used rebased on that.

522
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,500
Yeah, it kind of took over your whole life.

523
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,000
Mm-hmm.

524
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,300
Yeah, I went all in on 18.04.

525
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,700
And I think it's been a pretty great release.

526
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,500
I think it's been pretty solid.

527
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,100
I think—

528
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,400
Especially for workstations, for servers.

529
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,000
I mean, I think 16.04 was a big culmination for the project in general,

530
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,900
just with all the changes that had happened.

531
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,200
Yeah.

532
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,200
And then 18.04 is just a shiny, nice OS.

533
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,600
It's one of those releases that you feel really comfortable recommending, you know,

534
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,300
to new people and stuff.

535
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,200
It's like, yeah, give this a go.

536
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,800
Give that—give this a try.

537
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,400
And I felt like at the end of 2018, 18.04 still stands out,

538
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,600
you know, a year—almost a year later now.

539
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,900
It really still stands out as one of the best releases that they've had

540
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,000
and one of the better desktop Linux releases.

541
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,700
Every distro's got good releases,

542
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,100
but this, I thought, was a particularly good one.

543
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm sure anybody in the moment, if they want to chime in on that,

544
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,800
I'm sure you guys probably feel similar.

545
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,200
But if you don't, feel free to interrupt me.

546
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
I wholeheartedly agree, Chris, of course.

547
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,700
Of course you do.

548
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,900
But I think even, you know—

549
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,600
I mean, even as somebody who works for Canonical,

550
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
you have to admit there's some releases that are good,

551
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
and there's some releases that seem like they're pretty great.

552
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,500
And I think you guys do a pretty good job of nailing it on the LTSs.

553
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,200
14.04 was solid, 16.04 was solid, and 18.04 is solid.

554
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,800
But now you've really got it down.

555
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,100
Live patching, hardware enablement, backporting, like the whole thing.

556
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:03,000
Like, there's just—there's very little penalty now for using the LTS.

557
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,600
And it really kind of all came together.

558
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,900
I've long stuck on the LTSs like most normal people.

559
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,400
And as I've mentioned here before,

560
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,000
the number of people who stick to LTS releases of Ubuntu is,

561
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,400
you know, an order of magnitude greater than those people who venture into the non-LTSs.

562
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,900
And sure enough, there are people who try the non-LTSs,

563
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,400
especially those adventurous gamers who want the latest Mesa

564
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,300
or some other interesting driver for a bit of hardware they have.

565
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,600
Sure, and that's what that's there for, is to try out that new stuff.

566
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,300
But the stability of the LTS is so critical.

567
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,600
And 18.04 has, I agree, been pretty fantastic.

568
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,100
I'm running 18.04 on my main machine here,

569
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,600
and I have no intention of moving off it right now.

570
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,300
And I think a lot of the projects that are based on Ubuntu have benefited from it too.

571
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:59,000
The elementary team released Juno this year, and it is a great release.

572
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,800
And that project is firing on all cylinders in a way that no other distribution is.

573
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,000
It's really impressive to watch that.

574
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,500
But another 2018 item that impacted me, like in an emotional way even.

575
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,500
And now looking back on it feels like, what is it?

576
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,800
What is the, not a Tempest, what's the same?

577
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Tempest and a decup.

578
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,300
Is that it? Is that it? Okay.

579
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:28,300
Yeah, the kernel code of conduct stuff just blew up in a...

580
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,300
Huge news.

581
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,300
In a way that was just maybe way, way, way, way too strong.

582
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:38,300
Not because these things don't matter, but because if you're not involved with the project,

583
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,300
you know, you don't really have a lot of skin in the game.

584
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,800
Right, like if you didn't hear any news, you didn't know about Linus stepping away,

585
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,300
any of that stuff, kernel releases, I mean, they kept happening, work on goes.

586
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,800
Yeah, I think looking back on it, what bothers me about it the most

587
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,800
is something that the Linux community does more and more as we are more hyper connected on the internet.

588
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
And that is we have secondary outrage.

589
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,800
We almost like we get outraged on the behalf of another individual.

590
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,800
So some other individuals, in this case, the kernel developers are being oppressed by this code of conduct.

591
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,800
And so everyone freaks out and gets outraged, even though it doesn't directly affect them.

592
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,300
They're not involved with the project.

593
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,800
They won't be under this code of conduct.

594
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,300
I mean, you could argue they use the product, but, you know, but the outrage just was,

595
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,300
it was as if each person was individually affected by the change.

596
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,800
And we, you know, we just like to make doom and gloom predictions too.

597
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,800
And it's hard when there are big things announced, big changes to just be like, take a beat, let's see how this goes.

598
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,300
Well, and not to toot our own horn, but I feel like that was sort of our take on it was everybody slow down

599
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,300
and let's just see how this thing plays out.

600
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,800
I mean, we, you know, we had a lot behind the scenes where we kicked,

601
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,300
we voiced everybody's opinions and everybody, we really kind of had a group discussion.

602
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,800
But when we got a microphone, we kind of in that episode, I feel like took a more.

603
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
All right, let's just let's just everybody slow down.

604
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,800
And remember that we need to trust the people that are running the project,

605
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:08,300
the people that are developing the kernel know more than we do about what it's like to develop the kernel.

606
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:13,300
But I think we'll always kind of look back at that as I don't want to say a stain

607
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,800
because there's still valid points that were made in the discussion.

608
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,800
But I wonder if we'll see any changes or progress in that discussion in 2019.

609
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,300
Not our proudest moment, though. Not our proudest moment.

610
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:30,300
Chrome OS, Linux apps coming, you know, we watch that go from a rumor to beta to shipping.

611
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,300
They really moved on that pretty quickly.

612
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,800
And now we have full fledged Linux applications on Chrome OS and Google's really signaling,

613
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,300
hey, this is a platform for developers now.

614
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,800
It's becoming a full fledged operating system.

615
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,800
A couple of years ago, would you have ever thought that like Google's making a desktop Linux?

616
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,300
It's supposed to be the web browser OS, you know, and they're just using Linux as a detail.

617
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,300
I thought they were a search engine.

618
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,300
I thought they were an ad company.

619
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,300
Yeah.

620
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,300
I mean, now you're thinking that this next year is going to be the one where you do get a Chromecast.

621
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,300
A Chromebook. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, you're right.

622
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,300
Yeah, I mean, because they added that support.

623
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,300
They added that support.

624
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,300
What do you think, guys?

625
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:12,300
Code of conduct and the Chrome stuff, would you rank those as major moments in 2018?

626
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:17,300
Brent, how do you feel like looking back on the code of conduct stuff and Chrome OS?

627
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,300
Does that stand out to you as something that shifted?

628
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,300
Well, I think as you were talking about it, I was thinking, well, OK, imagine ourselves in five years

629
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
and looking back, what are the things that are going to stand out?

630
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:33,300
And I think certainly those are unusual happenings that really, really shook things.

631
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,300
Or at the very least got tons of people talking.

632
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,300
So is that alone a benefit?

633
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,300
Yeah, I think so.

634
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,300
And we're still talking about it.

635
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,300
So, yeah, maybe they're a good thing.

636
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,300
Still playing out, right?

637
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,800
The code of conduct is a living document.

638
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,300
It's been modified once already.

639
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:53,300
And Chrome OS, Linux apps, like we just covered in the community news, getting GPU support now.

640
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,300
So they're getting even more sophisticated.

641
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,300
Well, and it played into your predictions, too, right?

642
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:05,300
You're expanding on that idea of Chrome OS running Linux apps to Fuchsia and things like that.

643
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,300
So it's continuing for sure.

644
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:19,300
All right, the other area that just saw rapid development and just blew up in 2018 is Proton.

645
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:27,300
Steam play, it just went from like here is 15 officially supported games to, oh, by the way, it's actually more like 2000.

646
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,300
You can actually play like 2000 Windows games.

647
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,300
Most of them work.

648
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,300
Wine is over 20 years old.

649
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,300
It took us 25 years to get a handful of games.

650
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,300
And then it took us, not us, it took Valve and the developers their pain.

651
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,300
It took them three, four months to get us 2000.

652
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,300
It just exponentially expanded.

653
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,300
It is amazing.

654
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,300
I mean, it's amazing in some sense, like how close we were.

655
00:31:54,300 --> 00:32:00,300
You know, there's a lot of fundamentals in wine and the work that's been put in over the years to make this possible.

656
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,300
And now we're actually reaping the benefits.

657
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:10,300
And before, I mean, right, there were some games that worked and you could do things and if you really had all the right bottles set up.

658
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,300
But I never recommended that to anyone.

659
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:17,300
And now people who I was thinking about converting will be like, well, here, look at this giant database to games you can play.

660
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,300
Yeah.

661
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:24,300
And when you turn on Steam play, you click the play button and it just launches and it'll come up with a message saying, you know, it's not optimized for this operating system or whatever.

662
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,300
But even that's very vague.

663
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,300
You don't really know.

664
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,300
You're like, well, I don't care.

665
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
Just play a damn game.

666
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,300
And it works.

667
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
It works.

668
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,300
And the hell out of No Man's Sky.

669
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
Oh.

670
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,300
In creative mode.

671
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
They didn't have that the last time I played.

672
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,300
The last time I jury rigged it under wine, I got it working for like two months under wine.

673
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,300
And then it didn't update because the game was so bad when it launched.

674
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,300
And they didn't update and it quit working under wine.

675
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,300
And I just kind of didn't bother.

676
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,300
And now with Brodon, well, let's try it again.

677
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,300
And the game's way better than it was at launch now.

678
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,300
It's way more fun to play.

679
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,300
So I've really liked that.

680
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,300
And now that I have that GPU dock too, it's like, oh, I got a GPU.

681
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,300
Might as well, you know, got to do this guy one.

682
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,300
Yeah, that's going to change the discussions too, right?

683
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,300
You can point outsiders to this.

684
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,300
People skeptical of, well, does it ever really work on Linux?

685
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,300
It already does.

686
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
Yeah.

687
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,300
I remember on Linux Action Show was it a few years ago when you guys were in the wants,

688
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,300
like, oh, crazy desires episode.

689
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,300
You guys were saying, oh, if only we had games, right?

690
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,300
And now it's a normal thing.

691
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,300
Yeah.

692
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,300
That's a huge success for sure.

693
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,300
All right.

694
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,300
Just a couple more quick ones to get us ready for our Hope Casting because we've probably

695
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,300
reflected on these enough.

696
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,300
The LVFS project getting official firmware support by a bunch of vendors.

697
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,300
Yeah, right.

698
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,300
At the start of the year, there were a couple, but now it feels like most in some quadrants.

699
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,300
Yeah, that is massive momentum that they're going to carry into 2019.

700
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,300
And WireGuard.

701
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,300
WireGuard is incredible.

702
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,300
It's going to be a game changer for Linux.

703
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,300
The hype, I know it's strong, but the reason why I say it is if you use it, you'll know.

704
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:59,300
When a VPN is as simple as key exchanges and upping and downing an interface, it becomes

705
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,300
a glue that will hold the internet together.

706
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,300
It really will.

707
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,300
And we've just seen it get so far in 2018.

708
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,300
I feel like it's one of the underappreciated success stories of 2018 is WireGuard.

709
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,300
It's not very often a new way to VPN comes around.

710
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,300
It all just went so well.

711
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,300
It's almost sort of suspicious.

712
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,300
It's like it just works.

713
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,300
Everyone seems to like it.

714
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,300
There's already commercial providers.

715
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
If you want that route.

716
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
I'm already using it.

717
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,300
And it's so good.

718
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,300
You're using it?

719
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,300
It's so good.

720
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,300
I'm using it from an iPad.

721
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,300
And you set it up.

722
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,300
I mean, like, you did a couple of things.

723
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,300
Yeah, I was like, yeah, this isn't too bad.

724
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,300
And then I got two more.

725
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,300
So in order of, I think, just huge shocks to me.

726
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:44,300
Seriously, Neon, KDE Neon took the year by storm.

727
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,300
I watched their groups, you know, the Telegram groups, and I pay attention to the Reddits

728
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,300
and been running it now for a while on a few of my machines.

729
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,300
And I don't know what it is.

730
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:00,300
I don't know if it's a meta overlay or if it is a distribution.

731
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,300
Some would argue it's not.

732
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,300
I was talking with Simon Quigley in the Telegram channel, the Jupiterbroadcasting.com

733
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,300
slash Telegram.

734
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:13,300
And he was arguing that because it's really just a matter of scripts and continuous integration

735
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,300
and then deploying on that basis, that it's not technically a distribution.

736
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,300
And I was arguing that it still takes care and time to put that together.

737
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,300
And when they transitioned from 1604 to 1804, that they worked on that and were very hands-on

738
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,300
and that makes it a distribution, even if they don't like it.

739
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,300
But either way, their user base is huge.

740
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,300
Now, like KDE Neon has a serious representation.

741
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:38,300
And it's remarkable because in a lot of ways, it's completely inappropriate for a lot of users.

742
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:46,300
It's a way to use the latest and greatest Plasma desktop that maybe shouldn't be fully deployed yet.

743
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,300
I don't know.

744
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,300
I use it, not on all my production systems.

745
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:57,300
On my production systems, I use Kubuntu 1804, which to me is a better workstation distribution

746
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,300
because it's LTS top to bottom.

747
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,300
I mean, on the desktop, when you get a new feature or something works on the bed, you're like,

748
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,300
oh, yay, change, fun, okay.

749
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,300
And on your server or your workstation, you're like, oh, no, I'm not ready to learn a new workflow.

750
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,300
Or why would you change that setting I was using to rely on?

751
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,300
But it was Neon's year.

752
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,300
I mean, they went huge in 2018.

753
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,300
It's surprising it worked so well.

754
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,300
But I think it speaks to that simplicity that we were talking about earlier.

755
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,300
And that 1804 base.

756
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,300
Yeah, a great base.

757
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
Yeah, that too helps.

758
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:36,300
And then lastly, you just can't get through 2018 without mentioning IBM buying Red Hat for $34 billion.

759
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,300
That's sort of the biggest story of the year.

760
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,300
There's just no getting around that.

761
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:48,300
Anything that sells for $34 billion is if Red Hat sold for $2 billion, that would have been a big story, okay?

762
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,300
$34 billion and IBM, huge story.

763
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,300
And there's just no getting around that.

764
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,300
Like Brent said, I like Brent's perspective.

765
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,300
I take a five-year perspective, that's still a big story, right?

766
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,300
In five years, that's still a big story.

767
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
Oh, yeah, right.

768
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,300
We haven't really even seen at all what the outcome of this is going to be.

769
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,300
No.

770
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,300
Early days isn't even fair.

771
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,300
It's not even early days still.

772
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,300
It'll be early days after the merger is approved and it's actually happened, then it's early days.

773
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,300
We're like in the pre-show still.

774
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:28,300
I look back at 2018 and that is, by the way, a super brief summation we have because of Linux Action News.

775
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:35,300
And this show, Joe and myself have been tracking stories and you have been tracking stories relentlessly all year round.

776
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,300
And this is like such a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of what's happened.

777
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,300
The pace of development and major things happening.

778
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,300
Like I didn't even mention Microsoft buying GitHub, you know?

779
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,300
There's all sorts of stuff just on the cutting room floor right here.

780
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,300
So there's so much.

781
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:58,300
When you think about what's happened, guys, when you think about what Microsoft's done about Red Hat, about Proton, about Meltdown,

782
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:05,300
like almost anything is possible in 2019, even as batshit crazy as Oracle GPLing ZFS.

783
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,300
Could happen.

784
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,300
Oracle could get bought by a company that open sources it, you know?

785
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,300
It could happen.

786
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:15,300
So I thought, let's take some time and do our Hopecast for 2019.

787
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,300
And I'll start with that one.

788
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:26,300
I hope in 2019, Oracle just settles all of this shenanigans around ZFS and just open sources it properly and GPLs it.

789
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:31,300
One of the things that's happening in the background right now is the Lumos,

790
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,300
which is essentially the master upstream for ZFS, kind of.

791
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:39,300
At least it is for FreeBSD and the BSD projects and a bunch of other stuff.

792
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:45,300
The repo where previously a lot of the main feature work for ZFS took place.

793
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:50,300
That's all transitioning now to be rebased off of the ZFS on Linux project.

794
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,300
That will sort of be the master upstream project.

795
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,300
We're going to get into more details in a future episode very soon with very specific information.

796
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,300
But at a high level, that's a huge shift for the industry just right there.

797
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:06,300
Just sort of all the other projects realigning under the ZFS on Linux project.

798
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:11,300
And it would just be the perfect solution.

799
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,300
Like they could own the market.

800
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:20,300
Oracle's file system could dominate the entire market if they just GPLed it and could get it mainlined in the Linux.

801
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,300
That's what my magic wand Hopecast is for 2019.

802
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,300
I know it's boring, but it would change so many things.

803
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,300
It would change so many things for Linux.

804
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,300
It would be massive.

805
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
I have a question about that, Chris.

806
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,300
What do you think would be their incentive to have it be run everywhere?

807
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,300
That's tough and that's why I'm very skeptical.

808
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,300
That's why it's in the magic wand section and not predictions.

809
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,300
But you could ask that same question about a lot of the actions Microsoft has taken recently.

810
00:39:49,300 --> 00:40:00,300
And it usually takes several layers of analysis to really get to the root of how does Microsoft open sourcing XYZ benefit them?

811
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,300
And you can usually work your way there, but you got to really think it through.

812
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:14,300
And maybe there's something there we're not seeing yet with Oracle that they could maybe there's some advantage to having your file system be the number one enterprise file system.

813
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,300
Maybe there's a way to make money from that, even if you're not selling licenses for it.

814
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,300
Because they're not making a ton of money on it right now.

815
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,300
Everybody's just re-implementing the open source free version.

816
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,300
They're using the ZFS on Linux, open ZFS or the Lumos version.

817
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:32,300
There's not like a revenue stream that they'd be giving up on other than people that are buying unbreakable Linux.

818
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,300
And all five of those people are not really going to make a big difference, I think.

819
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,300
But I couldn't tell you what it would be.

820
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,300
I don't know.

821
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,300
What about you, Mr. Payne?

822
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,300
You got any magic wand, Fu?

823
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,300
Yeah, okay.

824
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,300
Yes, I do.

825
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:51,300
If I could have something, I think it would be, well, I mean, there's a lot, there's many somethings, of course.

826
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,300
I know.

827
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,300
How about this?

828
00:40:54,300 --> 00:41:03,300
And totally, totally open source, commercially available touchpad that works with Linux of MacBook quality.

829
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,300
That could be integrated into laptops.

830
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,300
Yeah, right.

831
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,300
I mean, just like a regular part that you could buy, the driver was solid.

832
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,300
Oh, that is such a great one.

833
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,300
It'd be a small change, but I mean, I use this darn thing every day.

834
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,300
And it's still not good enough.

835
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,300
No, I know.

836
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:22,300
I mean, normally, actually, I don't hate touchpads, but this actively gets in my way.

837
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:28,300
The problem we have, both of us on our ThinkPad, it's like detecting our hand fat.

838
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:33,300
Even hovering over, I swear it hasn't made contact, and yet the cursor jumps halfway across my screen

839
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,300
and highlights a whole paragraph of text and replaces it with whatever.

840
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,300
I've had to get stuck where it thinks it's like still pressed.

841
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Yeah.

842
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
Yeah, it's not great.

843
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,300
It's not, not great.

844
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,300
No, it's not great.

845
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,300
That's a really good one.

846
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,300
I really don't think it's going to happen, but I would love it.

847
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,300
Something with like an open source haptic engine in it, maybe like a RISC-V processor

848
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,300
or one of those new open source MIPS processors to do the management inside there.

849
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,300
It could even be an Arduino, I suppose.

850
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
You know, you could go the keyboardios route.

851
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,300
Something that could be integrated into a laptop or a standalone trackpad.

852
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,300
Oh, yeah, that could be fine, too.

853
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,300
That'd be really nice.

854
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,300
I like that one a lot.

855
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,300
What about you, Mumbroom?

856
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,300
Anybody in the Mumbroom want to jump in with one of their Hopecasts?

857
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,300
I hate the word, but I don't got anything better.

858
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:16,300
Okay, I'll start with the small one, and this is where you can have an effect.

859
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,300
It also includes Linux Fest Northwest, actually.

860
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:24,300
So one huge thing that I think everyone would benefit from, and I personally would absolutely

861
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:31,300
love, if realistic, I'll put that in there, is to be able to listen live in real time

862
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,300
to the shows being recorded.

863
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,300
I think that'd be really awesome.

864
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,300
I like the audio stream again.

865
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,300
Could the audio stream work in again?

866
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,300
Do you have that wand?

867
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,300
We actually are assembling that wand right now.

868
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:46,300
Yeah, so the audio stream was working at the last Linux Fest, but there were some delays

869
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,300
last year, so it didn't really make sense.

870
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,300
So either if you can cut that delay or if...

871
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,300
Anyways, if you need some help, I'm totally willing to help with that, and if anybody

872
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:59,300
else is willing to help, I think that'd be really cool.

873
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,300
I feel like that could happen.

874
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,300
That may be one magic wand.

875
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,300
That's what I like to hear.

876
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,300
All right, all right.

877
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,300
So is there another one I can help you with, or is that it?

878
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,300
Is that where all my leverage is?

879
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,300
This is where Chris grants everyone's wishes.

880
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:18,300
I have many more, but I think one that's more sort of open source community, a little on

881
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:27,300
the outlandish side, which is always fun to chat about, would be I know that GDPR is encouraging

882
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:33,300
services to open up data so you can share between services, so you can get in and out

883
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,300
easily.

884
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:40,300
I would love to see that for OSs, so to make it much easier to get people out of certain

885
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,300
other OSs, say Apple, and into OSs like Linux.

886
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:48,300
I try to help a lot of people do that, and the most frustrating part is getting their

887
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,300
data out of their proprietary systems, so that's a big one for me.

888
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:57,300
Like a standard export function that collects up the documents, the photos, your desktop

889
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:03,300
icons, your settings, and puts them in like an easy-to-read file that any other operating

890
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:06,300
system could then import, and then it would put the information where it's supposed to

891
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,300
be in its relevant applications.

892
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,300
It's crazy talk, and I like it.

893
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,300
Yeah, right?

894
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,300
I mean, you could even make it easy, like, oh, yeah, these applications are installed.

895
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,300
Here's where their data lives.

896
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,300
Yeah.

897
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,300
That should be a thing, just like Google Takeout.

898
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,300
Yeah.

899
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,300
The hardest thing I've run into is trying to get even the simplest data out of iOS,

900
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,300
for instance, like notes.

901
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,300
Oh, no.

902
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,300
It's crazy how difficult it is to get out in a just bulk export way.

903
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,300
You can't even do it.

904
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,300
So I know that they're not incentivized to help you get out of there.

905
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,300
Right.

906
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,300
Yep.

907
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,300
That's the biggest problem is that they use that as a lock-in technique.

908
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,300
Well, yeah, that's it.

909
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:48,300
So that's a crazy outlandish hope that I would have to make the planet a better place.

910
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,300
I like that.

911
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,300
All right.

912
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,300
If you got more, hold on, and we'll come back around.

913
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,300
What about you, Bruce?

914
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,300
Do you have any wishes or hopes for 2019 if you could snap your fingers and make it happen?

915
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,300
Well, I didn't have too much time to think.

916
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,300
But the one thing that came to mind was something that might be in the crazy idea territory

917
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:09,300
is a non-distribution-specific public Linux repository of software.

918
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,300
Hmm.

919
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,300
A free software?

920
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,300
Sort of like old SourceForge?

921
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,300
Well, no.

922
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:18,300
You normally have your apt-get and your yum repositories connected to the distribution

923
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,300
that you've chosen.

924
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:24,300
But like the EPL kind of sort of thing where you subscribe to another repository, one that

925
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,300
is just kind of universal.

926
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:29,300
I'm not even sure it's a good idea, but this is what I've come up with on short notice.

927
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,300
I like it though.

928
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,300
I can see it.

929
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,300
I mean, really, part of that could be that one of those takes off because I feel like

930
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,300
there are some of those things.

931
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:39,300
And I guess in some ways you could think of snaps as those, but it's not quite the right

932
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,300
fit.

933
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,300
Hmm.

934
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,300
The other thing that I was thinking of was just the hardware support thing of Linux.

935
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,300
One thing that's a pet peeve of mine is when I go to the computer store and I look at a

936
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,300
box and it says, supports Linux or supports Windows and Mac.

937
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,300
Oh, yeah.

938
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,300
And then I pull up my phone and I look and see if somebody else has managed to get this

939
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:56,300
thing working.

940
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:00,300
I wish hardware companies would at least check and see whether their stuff worked in Linux

941
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,300
and put it on the box.

942
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,300
Oh, you're reading one of my hopes.

943
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,300
Yeah.

944
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,300
I have one about that if nobody else calls it.

945
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,300
Yeah, I agree.

946
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,300
Some branding, some marketing.

947
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,300
Just really quickly, that's mine.

948
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,300
Just like an organized group comes together, like a moderately well-funded organized group

949
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,300
could come together and do some marketing.

950
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,300
Yeah, right.

951
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,300
You hear like ads about like from the USB people.

952
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,300
So we could have Linux ads.

953
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,300
What's that foundation doing?

954
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,300
Dude, the Dairy Association got milk.

955
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,300
Like if we could have our own got milk, it would make a huge difference.

956
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,300
Got uptime.

957
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,300
Got freedom.

958
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,300
My hope for this year is one of positivity.

959
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:41,300
I would like to see us, and by us, I mean the wider Linux community and people who are

960
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:48,300
spectating and commenting on the Linux community, I wish we could focus on some of the positive

961
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:55,300
things that happen and the new applications people are developing and new features and

962
00:46:55,300 --> 00:47:02,300
freedoms that people are enabled with free software rather than focusing on all the drama.

963
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:07,300
We have a tendency in the Linux community to eat ourselves alive, and the rest of the

964
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:14,300
world looks on and thinks we're some kind of amateur hour idiots who just argue with

965
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,300
each other constantly.

966
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:21,300
And it would be lovely if we could count to 10, think, and maybe put out some positive

967
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:28,300
messages rather than constantly making articles and YouTube videos about the biggest drama

968
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,300
in Linux.

969
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,300
It gets tiresome, and it doesn't get us any further forward.

970
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,300
It does get tiresome.

971
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,300
And I'll also say this, too.

972
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,300
We can't afford all the...

973
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,300
What did you say?

974
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,300
We're eating our own tails?

975
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,300
It's sort of we just eat ourselves?

976
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:47,300
We are so far behind in market share when it comes to the desktop area and desktop adoption

977
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,300
and getting the market even recognize it as a viable platform for even web applications

978
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,300
and Unity games.

979
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,300
That's where we're at still.

980
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,300
We're getting better, but that's where we're at.

981
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:02,300
And so anything that really is effort that isn't spent in fixing that, any time we're

982
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,300
spending effort on tearing each other down, even when we think it's super justified, like

983
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,300
going back to that code of conduct thing, like everybody on both sides of that, even

984
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,300
now, as I say, that still feels like they were completely justified in their behavior

985
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,300
and on their...

986
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,300
But looking at it from the outside, in the rest of the industry, like a code of conduct

987
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:21,300
is standard operating procedure, and it's normal.

988
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:27,300
And so while you can argue if that's good or bad, when they look at it, they see what

989
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,300
we're doing and they go, what the hell are they freaking out about?

990
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:31,300
What is their problem?

991
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,300
And meanwhile, we're really not focused on the core issues and the core problems.

992
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,300
And it really changes.

993
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,300
It really changes things.

994
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,300
So I completely back that up.

995
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,300
And as much as we can, I hope we can contribute to that.

996
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,300
I feel like we've been trying to, you know, we try to walk the line.

997
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,300
We don't want to come on here and sort of sugarcoat everything.

998
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,300
And we also want things to talk about.

999
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,300
But also, and you guys know who watched the shows live, like we'll intentionally not run

1000
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:02,300
with a title that we think is extra clickbaity, even though, like we'll even have the conversation

1001
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:06,300
many times, we'll say, hey, that title would definitely get us some clicks, but we're not

1002
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,300
going to use it.

1003
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,300
Right?

1004
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,300
Like that happens all the time.

1005
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,300
And so it's a line you have to walk.

1006
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:14,300
And that's, it sounds stupid, but we kind of, we hope that in part it can be our contribution

1007
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:18,300
back as trying to direct the conversation in a positive way as much as appropriate.

1008
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,300
So I agree with that one, Poppy, and I really do hope that one comes true.

1009
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,300
Well, let's go back around the top.

1010
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,300
Brian, I think you said you had another one.

1011
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,300
You had another prediction, or actually, I guess let's not call it a prediction, but a hope.

1012
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,300
Yeah, I mean, hope is an interesting word because you can just make up whatever you

1013
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,300
would like, or you can make it a little bit more realistic.

1014
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,300
Right.

1015
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:37,300
Yeah.

1016
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,300
So I'm going to move to the realistic side, maybe.

1017
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:47,300
But I think Wes touched on this a little bit, but just to expand it, I think an open source

1018
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:52,300
mobile OS that's actually usable for almost the everyday person would be really great.

1019
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,300
I know we're making strides towards that.

1020
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,300
And it's coming very slowly.

1021
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,300
And we have some cool projects working on it, but just to see it become a bit more mainstream

1022
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,300
would be a real treat.

1023
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,300
If I could piggyback off that and, again, make it a little more real-ish.

1024
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,300
Please do.

1025
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,300
I would just say I wish for the Librem 5 to work out.

1026
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,300
Yeah, yeah.

1027
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,300
I like that.

1028
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,300
There's a lot of skeptics, but it would be so great, wouldn't it?

1029
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,300
Oh, yeah.

1030
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,300
I mean, I'm one of them.

1031
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,300
I really am.

1032
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,300
Yeah, I'm not hoping for a realistic hope.

1033
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,300
I'm hoping for it's just great.

1034
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,300
Yeah, yeah.

1035
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:30,300
So if they could even, even within like, I mean, I'd be okay with like within the year

1036
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:36,300
if it was I can make calls, I can look stuff up, maybe I can send some messages on Telegram

1037
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:42,300
or something, some real just basics, usable MVP style product.

1038
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,300
I'd be okay with that.

1039
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,300
That would be a success in my book.

1040
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,300
That would be a success, honestly.

1041
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:52,300
It wouldn't be ready to replace iOS or Android, but something that isn't crashy, that's usable.

1042
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,300
Something to build on.

1043
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,300
And it's free would be a massive accomplishment.

1044
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,300
And it's weird to think it's, I mean, it's within striking distance.

1045
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,300
It's possible, you know, we'll just see.

1046
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,300
So I like that one, Brent.

1047
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,300
You still sound so skeptic.

1048
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:14,300
It's just, you know, I think 2018 was also the year I kind of gave up on the idea that

1049
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,300
we're ever going to replace Coke and Pepsi.

1050
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:22,300
And it's like bumming me out a little bit because we've watched so many cool ideas over

1051
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:27,300
the years kind of go nowhere.

1052
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:31,300
So, you know, it seems almost impossible at this point because there's so much.

1053
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:38,300
Even if you built a great operating system with good apps and great security features

1054
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,300
and a fully free hardware and software stack, nothing says it'll have any market success

1055
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,300
in any way that makes revenue.

1056
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:50,300
There's still nothing that says you're because the mobile market isn't a regular, you know,

1057
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,300
products win on their merits market.

1058
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:58,300
It is a market where there's deals made, there's ecosystems, there's carriers, there's middlemen,

1059
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:04,300
salesmen, there's just so many factors at play that dictate success and so many entrenched

1060
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:11,300
interests that want the current Android and iOS normal ecosystem to be the thing because

1061
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,300
that's what makes the money.

1062
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,300
Like, it's just those entrenched interests aren't really all that motivated to sell some

1063
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,300
new unheard of product by some company that has no brand.

1064
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,300
Nobody knows who Purism is.

1065
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,300
They know who Apple is.

1066
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,300
They know who HTC and Motorola is.

1067
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:31,300
But even the phones by those companies like LG and HTC...

1068
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,300
There's already way too many phones to pick from.

1069
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,300
It makes it pretty hard to distinguish.

1070
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,300
And they don't make any money.

1071
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,300
The only...

1072
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,300
It's Apple and Samsung making money, right?

1073
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,300
And probably Goos.

1074
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,300
I don't know.

1075
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,300
But I just...

1076
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,300
Yeah, Brent.

1077
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,300
I mean, that is a magic wand one.

1078
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,300
But, oh, man, am I right there with you?

1079
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,300
Well, I got something that's a little more down to earth if you want.

1080
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,300
Just something that I think that actually could happen.

1081
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,300
All right.

1082
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,300
All right.

1083
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,300
Last year, I saw that Fedora set up with Flickr-free Linux boot.

1084
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,300
I hope 2019 sees that just widespread.

1085
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,300
Yeah.

1086
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,300
It's a small thing, but it's just...

1087
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,300
So nice.

1088
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,300
It's polish, right?

1089
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,300
So nice.

1090
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:07,300
So nice.

1091
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,300
And I'll say, too, I was thinking one of my hopes is that we finally finish off high

1092
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,300
DPI support.

1093
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,300
Oh, yes.

1094
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,300
Come on.

1095
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:18,300
You and I, towards the end of 2018, had an opportunity to buy new laptops, looked at

1096
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,820
it and decided to go with 1080p screens.

1097
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:24,420
If they had 2K screens in these laptops, I would have gone with that.

1098
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:29,260
But they had 4K screen options, they probably would have been better screens, but we just

1099
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,500
didn't want to fight with software issues, especially with some of the production software

1100
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,980
we use that isn't using GTK 3 or Qt, which maybe there's just nothing that can be done

1101
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:37,980
there.

1102
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:42,300
But I would love to see it because compared to the Mac, it's embarrassing.

1103
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,300
Oh, it is.

1104
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,100
Compared to Windows 10, we're doing all right.

1105
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,420
We're doing okay.

1106
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:52,300
But compared to the Mac, the Mac has had, quote unquote, retina support since 2012 or

1107
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,020
something like that.

1108
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:59,340
They've had that locked in now for multiple releases of multiple operating systems and

1109
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:02,960
they've iterated on multiple screen technologies in multiple laptops.

1110
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,420
They've destroyed their keyboards, but they nailed high DPI.

1111
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,100
You can only do so many things, Chris.

1112
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,100
And I would love to see that.

1113
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,980
I'd love to see a Mac OS level high DPI.

1114
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,440
And you can get close.

1115
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:17,240
If you live all GTK 3 or all Qt, or you're on elementary and you're installing all the

1116
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,180
elementary apps from the app center, you can get there.

1117
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:21,180
You can get there.

1118
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:26,260
But when you deviate out into applications that don't use the native toolkits-

1119
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,020
When you take advantage of that open source diversity.

1120
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:33,660
Yeah, that diversity we love so much, it does get a little wonky.

1121
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,860
And especially some of the more commercial applications.

1122
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,860
All right.

1123
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:41,440
Well, does anybody else have a hope they want to toss into the mix before we wrap it up?

1124
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,700
One last time to get on the record for 2019, Bruce.

1125
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,700
You want to try?

1126
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,700
Yeah.

1127
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,980
One thing I just came up with is I'd like to not have to fiddle with video drivers and

1128
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,140
just to be able to depend on them to do it there.

1129
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:53,740
I've always been an Nvidia guy, but lately I've run into problems with that.

1130
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:57,980
And it's always been a sore point with me with Linux system is just getting the video

1131
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:01,980
to behave and not to do flickery things and crash games and things like that.

1132
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,780
So I've been hoping that one for a long time, but that might be magic bond stuff too.

1133
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:10,140
It seems to be kind of like a one arm bandit kind of thing, whether you get a setup that

1134
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,820
works flawlessly or not.

1135
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,860
You know, I like that one, especially for those out there that are trying to use the

1136
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,900
Nvidia cards because that is still an area where I have a little bit of issue.

1137
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:24,940
My Intel only systems are so solid, they're literally the definition of zero hassle.

1138
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,500
It's so, so nice.

1139
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,500
I'll add onto that.

1140
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,500
I'll pile on.

1141
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,940
I'm going to say audio, you know, and I have had really good luck since we switched to

1142
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,540
plasma in 1804 in the studio.

1143
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,220
I have had really, really, really good systems.

1144
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:45,060
However, over the last couple of weeks and especially today, I have had significant audio

1145
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:51,460
problems where when I open up mumble or OBS impulse audio, it changes the input and output

1146
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:57,140
devices to just different devices, even in some cases, devices that are actually disabled.

1147
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,660
And my applications don't have audio.

1148
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,920
I could open up, say, a web browser and play a YouTube video just fine, but maybe that

1149
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,060
one application got the audio swapped.

1150
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:08,220
But there's other deficiencies to where pulse audio gets confused.

1151
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:12,460
If you have multiple audio devices with the same exact name, we standardized on a couple

1152
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:13,460
of audio interfaces.

1153
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:16,740
So some systems have three audio interfaces plugged into them because we're doing multi

1154
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,820
track recording and whatnot.

1155
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:21,320
And pulse audio will just kind of randomly mix them all up.

1156
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:26,980
So in one day you boot up in the drop down, it's one unit.

1157
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:29,780
But the next day in the same drop down, in the same slot in the drop down, it's a totally

1158
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,140
different audio unit and there's no way to tell them apart.

1159
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,660
So I'm really hopeful for PipeWire.

1160
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:40,040
I'm really hopeful that we finally nailed this because honestly, we were 15 minutes

1161
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,040
out from starting.

1162
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,540
I'm already on the live stream and I can't talk to the mumble room because even though

1163
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:49,340
I've been using this computer literally all day since 9 a.m. nonstop making shows with

1164
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,660
Wes because we're recording some content while I'm gone.

1165
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:55,340
So we've been in the studio since 9 a.m. recording without issue.

1166
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:58,740
But then we close one application and open up another application and the whole audio

1167
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,740
system's all screwing up.

1168
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,340
We walked away for 20 minutes and came back and nothing worked.

1169
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,900
We took a 20 minute break.

1170
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,860
And then across the table from me, a separate rig, same software stack, but we're using

1171
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,160
OBS instead of mumble, same problem.

1172
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,900
And it's just the weirdest thing.

1173
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,540
And I just completely lose confidence in the equipment when that happens because we start

1174
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:20,720
having like we start having a weird audio issue on the audio stream and now I don't

1175
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,880
know if it's something wrong with Pulse Audio, if it's something on the encoder, like I've

1176
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,300
lost confidence in the entire stack.

1177
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:30,700
And these are static systems that get minimal important critical updates and minimal reboots

1178
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,140
and except for about once a month.

1179
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,140
And yeah, right.

1180
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:39,500
I mean, that kind of plays into the pipewire hope of that's kind of that's been the problem

1181
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,120
too with what we're talking about clear desktop and other things.

1182
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:47,740
It's hard sometimes a really good desktop system or some of the goals that dynamic nature

1183
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,940
the usability make a pretty poor workstation, right?

1184
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:54,020
We didn't want things automatically changing because we want to set it up once and leave

1185
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,020
it.

1186
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:58,020
But we also don't have to rip out Pulse and then put Jack in or do something complicated,

1187
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,020
right?

1188
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:00,020
That's that's a lot more work.

1189
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,780
That's a lot more work on system just made it all work together.

1190
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,780
Mm hmm.

1191
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:04,780
Mm hmm.

1192
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,780
All right, Brent.

1193
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,780
I think you got another one in there.

1194
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,020
We probably get this last couple of ones in there.

1195
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,020
So I'd love to hear what you got.

1196
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,020
Sure.

1197
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,500
I was just wondering for your audio problem.

1198
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,700
It's not Brown Bear playing some New Year's tricks on you or anything.

1199
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,180
No, I don't think so.

1200
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:20,380
Because there's one thing he doesn't want me to do is rage quit using Linux.

1201
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:24,980
They don't think he wants that.

1202
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:27,420
So I have a JB related one.

1203
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,380
It's actually more of a question and then a Dell related one.

1204
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,380
All right.

1205
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,380
If we have time.

1206
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,380
Sure.

1207
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,260
So for JB, my question is, do you have any hopes for JB in the new year?

1208
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,060
It's been some major changes in 2018.

1209
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,860
Do you guys hope to see anything in 2019?

1210
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:41,860
Well, yeah.

1211
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:45,420
Yeah, I have a lot of really big, ambitious things.

1212
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,140
I haven't really thought about how much I want to talk about.

1213
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,140
That's a good question.

1214
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:53,140
Because we've been now, you know, now that we're part of a larger company, companies

1215
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:57,100
plan and they like set goals and stuff for like the next year.

1216
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:05,500
So since early November, I've been flying back and forth to Texas quite a bit, meeting

1217
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,140
with the leadership team down there and just kind of getting involved.

1218
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:14,100
I've taken on a larger role where I'm getting involved with other projects in the company,

1219
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,100
just advising.

1220
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:19,580
You know, it's one of the reasons they wanted to bring me on is just for other skill sets

1221
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,340
that I have that don't really come out on mic, I guess.

1222
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,340
I don't know.

1223
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,660
Maybe it's the hair.

1224
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,700
And that's been really interesting because it's given me a much broader perspective.

1225
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,740
It's given me insights into the larger industry as well.

1226
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:38,800
And I'll say in broad strokes, we want to do a lot more meetups that we could stream

1227
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,020
and have maybe an educational angle on them.

1228
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:45,420
I want to release some of the Linux Academy content for free to the community and then

1229
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:49,300
build study courses around them or videos, not full courses.

1230
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,980
I probably shouldn't use the same language they use because they're not, you know, it's

1231
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,060
our version of those things.

1232
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:58,060
They're not like the multi-month projects that the Linux Academy training architects

1233
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,060
go on.

1234
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,060
But something to introduce you to that.

1235
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:03,260
Something, you know, something that we can contribute back.

1236
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,220
So I want to free some of that up and release some of that and then use some resources to

1237
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:11,100
build videos around that as sort of a secondary thing to what we do now.

1238
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:15,640
But I want to grow our team a little bit.

1239
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:21,900
And I hope by the end of 2019, JB shows are like tap water.

1240
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,460
There's a release every single week like clockwork and we're really close.

1241
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:28,980
Like we almost never miss a week on any of our shows, but I want it to be universally

1242
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:34,340
true on all of our shows that every week there's something there, even if it has to be a week

1243
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:38,060
where we do something, we say, hey, we don't have a regular episode for you, but you know,

1244
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:41,780
and we just, you know, update you on what's going on and what to expect.

1245
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,100
So I want to get really good about that.

1246
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:47,460
Now that we've got a full time team, I feel like there's really no reason we can't achieve

1247
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,460
that.

1248
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:52,540
We only, we nearly got there when we were all doing it on our own time and now I feel

1249
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:55,440
like that we have a full time team should be achievable.

1250
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:00,340
So I want us to be a very reliable podcast network that's releasing great schedule for

1251
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,340
you guys.

1252
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:05,980
Um, and then this is the year one way or another that the website gets replaced.

1253
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:10,300
I have been, I have been done with the Jupiter broadcasting website for three years and now

1254
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:14,220
I, we're not even, we're not even living in the same home anymore.

1255
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:16,580
Me and the website are not even speaking to each other anymore.

1256
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,580
Oh, you make me be the intermediary.

1257
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:23,500
Wes, will you tell the website that I want this show posted?

1258
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,580
That's that's true in a lot of ways.

1259
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:28,020
Um, don't you love having a West?

1260
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,940
So yeah, it's pretty good.

1261
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:30,940
It's pretty good.

1262
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:36,500
So, uh, replacing the website, um, and then obviously we have a couple of, I think our

1263
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:44,460
most ambitious show ideas that we've ever done and, um, now we have more resources to

1264
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:45,460
pull some of those off.

1265
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:49,380
And I'm not talking like in production, but more like the, the, the host that'll be joining

1266
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,380
us.

1267
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,820
Um, and that's really exciting.

1268
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:55,980
Um, like, uh, actually we could probably, I mean, we kind of teased it what's happening

1269
01:01:55,980 --> 01:02:01,700
on tech snap, but tech snap for example, be the first show that seems some changes, um,

1270
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,060
some shows aren't gonna have anything change.

1271
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,900
Um, some shows are just like, you know, really, really like our plans for the show are just

1272
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:08,460
mostly keep doing what we're doing and see if we just can't, you know, always just do

1273
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,460
a better at it.

1274
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:10,460
Yeah.

1275
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:15,420
But for tech snap, um, we're going to replace me with Jim Salter, who is an author.

1276
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:20,260
And writer over at ours, technica and he's also previous tech snap guest, the previous

1277
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:24,460
tech snap guests, a wire guard expert and a sys admin by trade.

1278
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:28,500
And uh, he's going to be joining West and they both have practical hands on experience.

1279
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,660
That's very current.

1280
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:33,460
They both really sharp and both have strong opinions about this stuff.

1281
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:41,140
And um, so we want to bring that, that those style of hosts and, um, and quality to our

1282
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:42,140
show.

1283
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,500
So we want to really kind of raise the bar as much as we can in terms of production quality

1284
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:45,500
and host quality.

1285
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:49,220
Um, and you know, we can, you know, now we can afford to like buy, you know, recording

1286
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:52,260
remote recording kits and send them so people sound better and things like that.

1287
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,580
So we'll be doing more of that.

1288
01:02:53,580 --> 01:03:00,980
Uh, but really it's, it's, um, for us, it's sort of getting to just take the leash off

1289
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:05,060
and just go full bore at something that we've always wanted to be able to do, but never

1290
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,300
could quite pull it off.

1291
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,860
And now it's like, okay, well let's pull this off and pull this off.

1292
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:12,260
We're trying to break it down into quarters that way we don't overdo it and overbite and

1293
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,260
it's hard to decide, right?

1294
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,860
There's so many things like, Oh, we finally have some resource and time to do these things.

1295
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,860
What do we do first?

1296
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,740
So we've got quarter one goals and when we're building the quarter two goals right now and

1297
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:26,500
we're trying to think about things and what can we pull off and, uh, we had a new person

1298
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,500
join our team today.

1299
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,660
Um, I'm going to wait to announce her and talk about her until she can join us.

1300
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:33,220
But, uh, very excited about having her on.

1301
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:37,740
Um, she's a, she's a course architect also at Linux Academy and, uh, involved with the

1302
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:43,100
Docker community and, um, super sharp, funny, nice, just great to work with.

1303
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:46,020
Um, so we're able to grow the team a little bit and things like that.

1304
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:49,700
Uh, so those kinds of things I'm really looking forward to in 2019.

1305
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:53,300
And then just kind of seeing where this sole VP of community role takes it, uh, because

1306
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:57,920
it's already included, inclusive of a lot more than I originally expected.

1307
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,100
And it's, I think it's just kind of getting started because I'm a maniac.

1308
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:04,380
You know, they, uh, bought my company and then I'm going to come in and take them.

1309
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:05,380
Yeah, that's right.

1310
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,380
That's how we do.

1311
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:07,380
I know.

1312
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,380
Uh, okay.

1313
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:13,380
So that was the JB one, but there was a second one there, Brent.

1314
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:14,380
Yeah.

1315
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:16,260
Uh, the, uh, so anyways, thanks for that answer.

1316
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,260
That was awesome.

1317
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:19,300
And, um, well, sounds great.

1318
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:23,660
Um, the, the other one is, is a bit more maybe on point for what we're trying to do.

1319
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:29,460
And that's just, I hope that, uh, Dell, um, instead of having their Linux laptop offering

1320
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,700
be a little bit hidden, I would love to see it offered on all of their machines on the

1321
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,060
website anywhere.

1322
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:36,300
Really more prominent on the site.

1323
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,300
Well, yeah.

1324
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,300
Make it a standard option.

1325
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,300
That'd be great.

1326
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,300
Yeah.

1327
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,740
If only we knew of some wizard that could, uh, something like a Barton George style wizard.

1328
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:44,740
Oh yeah.

1329
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:47,260
I really, it's driven me so crazy what you're saying right now.

1330
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:50,540
It really makes me disappointed that they haven't fixed it by now.

1331
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:53,920
And I wonder if it's because they have such a tight relationship with Microsoft or what,

1332
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,060
but, or maybe they just feel that there's, there's no reason to do it.

1333
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,460
Maybe it'd be confusing for their customers or whatever else.

1334
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:02,740
You wouldn't have a strong sense that they have some really solid Linux offerings.

1335
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:05,180
Uh, of course they're already shipping it, right?

1336
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,180
Their website's not great.

1337
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:08,460
They may have one of the worst websites in the computer industry.

1338
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,080
I mean really HP has got a bad one too though.

1339
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:14,640
So it's, I find like browsing their site cause just for a few different reasons, I actually

1340
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:19,100
found it very difficult to find the Linux offering, even though I knew it existed, you

1341
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,100
know?

1342
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,940
So just go to Barton's blog and then he'll link yet.

1343
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:26,220
That's what I either go to Barton's blog or I Google search for Dell developer laptop.

1344
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:28,460
And yeah, that's exactly the only way to get there, right?

1345
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,460
Yeah.

1346
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,460
It's not good.

1347
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,860
And the fact that it hasn't been addressed is a little embarrassing at this point because

1348
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,740
it's a good product and it should.

1349
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:36,860
It works really well.

1350
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:39,500
They're doing it well and they just don't won't let you have it.

1351
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,980
No, but people, the word's getting out there.

1352
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,460
The word is getting out there about it.

1353
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:46,580
Uh, you know, the folks at Linux Academy, they're the, that and uh, the system 76 weeks

1354
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:47,580
to people.

1355
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:52,020
Linux Academy are talking about trying out some, so it's people find out even, even though

1356
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,300
it's not front and center.

1357
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,300
All right.

1358
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,300
Well you're on a roll brand.

1359
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,300
Anything else?

1360
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,300
Or was that it?

1361
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,300
Was that your last one?

1362
01:05:58,300 --> 01:05:59,300
Yeah.

1363
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,300
Yeah.

1364
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,300
I got one more phone.

1365
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,300
All right.

1366
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,300
It's, it's another question for you.

1367
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:04,300
Do you have any hopes for lady jupes in 2019?

1368
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,300
Solar.

1369
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:06,300
Solar.

1370
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,300
Solar.

1371
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,300
And I want to replace the batteries.

1372
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:12,580
I want to go full off grid and um, and then, and I don't think it's going to happen in

1373
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:17,340
2019 if I could really go crazy, I'd like to replace the really stupid old school sensors

1374
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:21,260
I have like in the tanks and for like the propane sensors, I'd like to replace it with

1375
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:25,740
like Arduinos or raspberry pie or something that would give me a dashboard of like my

1376
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,300
tank levels and my fuel level.

1377
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,300
That would be neat.

1378
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:29,300
Yeah.

1379
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,820
And the water heater and all that kind of stuff that has dumb switches and dumb toggle

1380
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,580
lights to tell me like, you know, if they're working or not.

1381
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:37,960
And it's just contact leads that like generate an electrical signal back to an led, right?

1382
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,540
So I know there's some way I could intercept that and have it feed into something.

1383
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:46,540
I know it's, it's, it's within my range to conceive of it, but like how to put it all

1384
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,540
together.

1385
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,540
I have no idea.

1386
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,020
And I'd love to address all of that stuff.

1387
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:55,580
But first I got to get better batteries and a solar well on that note, this was a lot

1388
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,580
of fun.

1389
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,760
Uh, I enjoyed hearing what everybody thinks and I think a lot of us were kind of thinking

1390
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:00,760
along the same things.

1391
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,140
Everybody had like another idea after somebody said something, I think that was some good

1392
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,140
stuff.

1393
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,140
I enjoyed it.

1394
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:06,140
And you know what?

1395
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:09,660
Just crossed my mind as we're wrapping up, um, just looking forward, like the next time

1396
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:12,060
I'm on this show, I'll be a married man again.

1397
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,620
Isn't that weird?

1398
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,620
Wow.

1399
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,620
That's weird.

1400
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:18,820
That is a weird starting 2019 out with a bang, you know, figured.

1401
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:19,820
Congrats.

1402
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:20,820
That's awesome.

1403
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:21,820
Thank you.

1404
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:22,820
Thank you.

1405
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:23,820
It is very exciting.

1406
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:24,820
Um, I hope everybody had a great new year.

1407
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:25,820
I hope you do have a great year.

1408
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:29,940
And if you'd like to get a hope cast in, I'm sorry for the name, if you got something better,

1409
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:30,940
I'd like that too.

1410
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:31,940
There's no going back.

1411
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:34,580
Linux, unplug.com slash contact.

1412
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:35,580
We can read a couple more.

1413
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:36,580
Oh yeah.

1414
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,580
Very fun.

1415
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:38,580
Get a couple of good ones in here and read them.

1416
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,580
I'd love to hear yours.

1417
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:42,460
And uh, maybe consider joining the show next week.

1418
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:47,420
I'll be out so the guys could use a little extra coverage, help the guys out, show up

1419
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:48,420
and uh.

1420
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:49,420
Come join.

1421
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:50,420
It'll be plenty of fun.

1422
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:51,420
Yeah.

1423
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,660
And then also go catch the last Ubuntu podcast.

1424
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:54,660
Maybe ever.

1425
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:55,660
You just don't know.

1426
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:56,660
That's the thing.

1427
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:57,660
We don't know.

1428
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:58,660
You can't know.

1429
01:07:58,660 --> 01:07:59,660
You don't know.

1430
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:00,660
They don't know until they have the curry.

1431
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,660
Ubuntu podcast.org.

1432
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,140
The last season's episode is out now.

1433
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:07,140
I think technically there will definitely be two episodes next year cause we've committed

1434
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:15,100
to doing one at um, at Joe's event at Vox, Fostalk and we've made predictions for next

1435
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,100
year.

1436
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,100
So we've got to do one at least at the end of the year.

1437
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,100
Got that one wrong.

1438
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,100
Got that one wrong.

1439
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:20,100
All right.

1440
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,100
Very good.

1441
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:22,100
Yeah.

1442
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,100
Well, all right.

1443
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:26,140
I look forward to those two episodes at least, but something, something tells me, something

1444
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:31,380
tells me we may see another season either way, Ubuntu podcast.org and go check out what's

1445
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,820
coming to TechSnap.

1446
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,540
Very excited about those changes.

1447
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:35,540
TechSnap.system.

1448
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:36,540
Systems or system?

1449
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:37,540
Systems.

1450
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:38,540
System?

1451
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:39,540
TechSnap.system.

1452
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:40,540
Systems.

1453
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:41,540
TechSnap.system.

1454
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:43,540
See if you say it a few times it might stick.

1455
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:47,180
And you can go to TechSnap.systems slash subscribe to get that.

1456
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:51,700
We just did my final episode that'll be going out later this week where we kind of reviewed

1457
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,500
some of the crazy great trends we've seen.

1458
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,500
Yeah.

1459
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,940
We'll talk about the things TechSnap's seen and where it's going to be going.

1460
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,240
That show has seen a few things, Wes.

1461
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,300
That show has seen a few things.

1462
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:03,580
And you can find links to whatever we talk about, although there wasn't really much,

1463
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:07,900
but we do have the community news and things like that linked at linuxunplug.com slash

1464
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:08,900
282.

1465
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:11,580
But that does bring us to the end.

1466
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,180
We're back to our regular BAT time and BAT channel.

1467
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:17,660
Tuesdays you can go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted in your

1468
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,860
local time zone and hang out in the Mumble Room.

1469
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:20,860
Join us there.

1470
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:24,420
Tell us your thoughts or the IRC room, always going during the show, always watching it.

1471
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,340
It's a really great community.

1472
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:28,780
Some of these people have been around for a very long time.

1473
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:29,780
It's great.

1474
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,780
They're just showing up.

1475
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:31,780
They're new.

1476
01:09:31,780 --> 01:09:32,780
You're welcome.

1477
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:33,780
You could be next.

1478
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:34,780
You definitely could.

1479
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:35,780
Thank you so much for joining us.

1480
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:36,780
You can follow me on Twitter at Chris Elias.

1481
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:37,780
He's at Wes Payne.

1482
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,820
The whole network at Jupiter Signal.

1483
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:43,500
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1484
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:48,380
Here's to a fantastic 2019 and the guys, not me, but the guys, we'll see you back here

1485
01:09:48,380 --> 01:10:05,140
next Tuesday.

1486
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:23,980
Unplugged program.

1487
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:25,700
I just thought of another hope.

1488
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:33,380
I hope I get open hab, home assistant, something set up in lady jupes in 2019.

1489
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:35,740
I think it's going to happen probably early 2019, really.

1490
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,720
I got that new Raspberry Pi.

1491
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:41,700
The whole thing with the kids, lukewarm.

1492
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,860
They like the switches way more than they like.

1493
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,140
So we've got the hardware.

1494
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:49,340
I've heard the software might be a free and open source.

1495
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:52,340
So for people that don't know, I got the new Raspberry Pi that came out, you know, the

1496
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:56,560
smaller one that's a little cheaper, but like a lot worse, but not too worse.

1497
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,340
So like this will run RetroPie just fine.

1498
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:01,500
And I looked it up first and yeah, everybody said it's going to run RetroPie just fine.

1499
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:02,500
Super proud of myself.

1500
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:03,500
Got a case.

1501
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,500
So we assembled it like Legos.

1502
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,500
That was fine.

1503
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:09,660
Then we got all hooked up and you know, I got the CRT television.

1504
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:10,660
So backstory.

1505
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:13,340
I bought a CRT television, but anyways, I'm like, well, let's go hook it up because you're

1506
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:17,540
going to have a whole day at work with dad on this is on Monday and because they're out

1507
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,540
of school.

1508
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,580
And so I'm doing coder.

1509
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:20,580
So when I bring the kids, right?

1510
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:21,580
Yeah, right.

1511
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:22,700
You got some games for them.

1512
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:28,060
I go up there after thinking, well, this will keep them busy for an hour within 10 minutes.

1513
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:32,040
They turned it off and instead busted out the Legos and decided to build like a Lego

1514
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,580
castle around the TV.

1515
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:38,420
And I mean, it looks cool, but they just were like not interested at all.

1516
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,660
Oh, that is disappointing.

1517
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,140
It's not Mario.

1518
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,620
They're out.

1519
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:45,820
The RetroPie experiment didn't go well.

1520
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:50,160
So now we have a free Raspberry Pi to use for our home assistant or home bridge or whatever

1521
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:51,160
we want to use.

1522
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:54,100
We'll see how many we can set up on one machine.

1523
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:57,220
The whole chat room wants me to talk about this.

1524
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:04,740
This Ethan tweet where so this there has been a real I guess you call it a tweet storm.

1525
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:05,740
I don't know what you call it.

1526
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:10,500
There's been a lot of upset on Twitter today because someone named Ethan, not Ethan from

1527
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:16,580
H3, but a different Ethan, a game developer, tweeted out a very poignant picture of how

1528
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,700
game developers will claim that Linux is too niche.

1529
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:22,900
But meanwhile, they're building apps for Fire TV, Tizen, Apple Watch, the Nvidia Shield,

1530
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:24,680
the jump device.

1531
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:25,680
And there's so many.

1532
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,680
There's so many more.

1533
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:29,780
We all know that all these crazy devices that people make their games for their applications

1534
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:32,660
for but Linux, that's too niche.

1535
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:36,600
And man, did that not just kick off the biggest back and forth between developers who claim

1536
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,460
that Linux is horrible to write for and others say that Linux is the only one they can

1537
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,640
stand writing for.

1538
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,640
It's all over Twitter today.

1539
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,460
It's really it's kind of a thing.

1540
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:49,500
It's when you if you just go to Twitter today and search for Linux, that's all anybody's

1541
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,620
talking about.

1542
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:52,620
Everybody's really upset.

1543
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:56,100
And I don't have anything to make them feel better.

1544
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:10,980
There's nothing you can say.
