WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
So, none of us probably are really happy with the state of advertising on the web.

00:04.480 --> 00:06.880
I'm looking at you, Ferronix.

00:06.880 --> 00:10.280
And it seems like adblock isn't quite enough.

00:10.280 --> 00:13.640
So check out this new type of adblock.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.840
It's called adnauseum.

00:15.840 --> 00:22.440
And this not only hides ads using your standard adblock plugin, it also simultaneously clicks

00:22.440 --> 00:27.600
all of the ads and hides all of the associated windows that come up after they've been clicked

00:27.600 --> 00:32.720
to send click signals to all the advertising networks to essentially jam their signals.

00:32.720 --> 00:33.720
Bam!

00:33.720 --> 00:37.240
Yeah, to basically make it like, okay, well fine, you're going to keep trying to get more

00:37.240 --> 00:39.800
and more invasive with the tracking.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.520
When that first comes out, a bunch of sites, probably like Ferronix, are going to get banned

00:44.520 --> 00:46.400
from the advertising networks for click fraud.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.400
I know.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.400
Who is that?

00:48.400 --> 00:49.400
That's Alan.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.400
Hi.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.400
Oh, okay.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.400
I was going to say, that sounds like Alan.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.760
That sounds like some handsome Canadian I know.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.240
I know there's another guy that does sound like Alan.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.240
Have you been talking to other Alans?

00:58.240 --> 00:59.240
It really sounded like Alan.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.240
No, no, no, no.

01:00.240 --> 01:01.240
Have you been talking to other Canadians?

01:01.240 --> 01:02.240
No, it's another mumble guy.

01:02.240 --> 01:03.240
Hi, Alan.

01:03.240 --> 01:04.240
Really?

01:04.240 --> 01:07.240
Somebody that sounds like me, I must find this person and destroy it.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.240
Right, exactly.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.240
So what do you think?

01:09.240 --> 01:11.240
Do you think this is going to cause a problem?

01:11.240 --> 01:15.120
Do you think this is going to cause like a big upset on the web?

01:15.120 --> 01:17.960
This sounds like a gigantic dick move to me.

01:17.960 --> 01:21.280
It's GPL too.

01:21.280 --> 01:26.920
It seems to me that like, you know, if you were to install it, you're, just you wouldn't,

01:26.920 --> 01:27.920
you wouldn't do anything.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.600
They'd be like, haha, look at those, look at they're trying to, you know, essentially

01:31.600 --> 01:32.600
DDoS, right?

01:32.600 --> 01:37.120
Well, it's to, I think it's to piss off the advertisers.

01:37.120 --> 01:43.000
What happens if one of the advertising sites is compromised?

01:43.000 --> 01:49.560
Does that mean you click through some chunky Java thing that compromises your machine?

01:49.560 --> 01:52.680
Although the way the code works is I guess it immediately kills the window or something

01:52.680 --> 01:53.680
like that.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.160
Iamicon brings up a very good point.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.240
What's that, Andrews?

01:56.240 --> 02:01.960
He says, so are some, well, I think his point is like, if you went to a site where you're

02:01.960 --> 02:09.320
okay with ads, you're, you'd be doing, your dick move gets a dick move, right?

02:09.320 --> 02:13.400
But isn't that true with just using ad block if you're, if you like, say you really liked

02:13.400 --> 02:14.400
Ferran.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.400
No.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.400
Cause that's passive.

02:16.400 --> 02:20.800
Well, if you really thought, no, this website is aggressive.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.800
It's true.

02:21.800 --> 02:22.800
You're not.

02:22.800 --> 02:23.800
Yeah.

02:23.800 --> 02:24.800
You're just not displaying them.

02:24.800 --> 02:25.800
Yeah.

02:25.800 --> 02:30.280
There is definitely a potential for problems with malicious ads.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.280
It's Alan.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.680
Also, Iamicon brings up another good point.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.320
Ad block doesn't stop Ferronics.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.640
Yes, it does.

02:41.640 --> 02:45.240
Really what you should do is, I see no adverts on Ferronics right now.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.240
Neither do I.

02:46.240 --> 02:52.860
Go, go do the tutorial we did on BSD now, and you can block them on your BSD or Linux

02:52.860 --> 02:57.400
based router, and then you just replace all the ads on the websites with a one by one

02:57.400 --> 02:58.880
pixel GIF file.

02:58.880 --> 03:02.160
I just think that if you don't have a problem with ad block, you really shouldn't have a

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
problem with ad nauseam.

03:03.160 --> 03:08.440
I mean ad nauseam, yes, is one step further, but ad block is still robbing the websites

03:08.440 --> 03:09.440
of view revenue.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.440
It is.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.440
Right.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.960
But that's just not giving viewers, whereas the click fraud is actually, yeah, it causes

03:15.960 --> 03:16.960
serious issues.

03:16.960 --> 03:17.960
I mean, I agree.

03:17.960 --> 03:18.960
It's another step.

03:18.960 --> 03:24.440
I tend to turn it off for sites that I use a lot, so actually I see quite a lot of adverts

03:24.440 --> 03:26.800
on the web because I disable it for a lot of sites.

03:26.800 --> 03:27.800
I do try.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.720
I forget to do that, but I do try to do it for some sites.

03:30.720 --> 03:35.000
At the same time, there are some sites who actually detect that you're running ad blocking

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
software and tell you about it.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Yeah, they guilt trip you.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yeah.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Yeah, exactly.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.680
Well, they not only guilt trip you, but also say, if you don't turn that off, we're going

03:42.680 --> 03:46.720
to do this, this, and this, like cookies and what have you to track you.

03:46.720 --> 03:47.720
All right.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.720
Second pre-show topic.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.720
Okay.

03:49.720 --> 03:50.720
I got a second pre-show topic.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.720
All right.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.280
Because I think everybody's probably done with this one.

03:53.280 --> 03:57.720
I'm really excited and I need like a correspondent to keep us posted on new developments because

03:57.720 --> 04:02.560
there is, in the makings, an open source Age of Empires II clone.

04:02.560 --> 04:03.560
Meh.

04:03.560 --> 04:04.560
Nice.

04:04.560 --> 04:05.560
Really?

04:05.560 --> 04:06.560
I know.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.920
He like backed away from the microphone to give that silent pause.

04:08.920 --> 04:09.920
I was excited.

04:09.920 --> 04:10.920
Yeah.

04:10.920 --> 04:13.240
My favorite childhood game.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.240
Yeah.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.240
This is like...

04:15.240 --> 04:16.240
I never...

04:16.240 --> 04:17.240
It was never my favorite.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.440
Oh, Age of Empires is great.

04:20.440 --> 04:23.480
And I've always wanted on Linux and right now, that's one of the reasons I use Crossover

04:23.480 --> 04:24.480
actually, is to get...

04:24.480 --> 04:25.480
I use Crossover to play.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.480
Canyon Conqueror was better.

04:26.480 --> 04:27.480
Yeah.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.480
I like them both.

04:28.480 --> 04:32.880
But as far as a continuation of Age of Empires, Rise of Nations was nice.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.880
It kind of combined Age of Empires with Sin, but kept the real time aspect.

04:36.880 --> 04:37.880
Yeah.

04:37.880 --> 04:42.000
My dad's a big fan of that game.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.080
So it's going to be called Open Age.

04:44.080 --> 04:53.080
It's being written in C++ 11 with Python scripting support.

04:53.080 --> 04:54.080
I don't know.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.080
I'm pretty excited.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.160
I love the idea of a native Age of Empires on Linux.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.320
Maybe because I currently use Wine to play Age of Empires III.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.320
So I feel the pain.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.320
I know.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.320
It's pretty exciting.

05:04.320 --> 05:05.320
I love it.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.320
I love it.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.320
I love old games come back with a vengeance.

05:07.320 --> 05:14.840
That's some good music, but what am I doing on this show?

05:14.840 --> 05:19.360
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's powered by a failed adrenal

05:19.360 --> 05:20.360
gland.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.360
My name is Chris.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.480
And my name is Matt.

05:22.480 --> 05:28.640
I just say that because I feel like I've exhausted all adrenal glands in my body, but I'm here.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.640
Adrenal gland.

05:29.640 --> 05:30.640
It gives you adrenaline?

05:30.640 --> 05:31.640
Really?

05:31.640 --> 05:32.640
Nobody knows about adrenal glands except for me?

05:32.640 --> 05:33.640
Okay, fine.

05:33.640 --> 05:34.640
Whatever.

05:34.640 --> 05:35.640
It was a bad intro.

05:35.640 --> 05:38.920
But that's okay, because we're going to make up for it with the rest of the show, Matt,

05:38.920 --> 05:42.360
coming up in this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.060
We're going to go down to Seagull.

05:44.060 --> 05:48.000
It was going on at the same time as Ohio Linux Fest.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.800
And producer Eric was there, scoring us some interviews.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.800
So we're going to do that.

05:51.800 --> 05:56.520
Plus, our follow-up from Ohio Linux Fest will get the crew's take on the trip.

05:56.520 --> 06:00.640
And that's why very special guest Angela Fisher joins us in the studio today.

06:00.640 --> 06:01.640
Here I am, everybody.

06:01.640 --> 06:02.640
Hello, hello, Angela.

06:02.640 --> 06:03.640
Hello.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.640
Two shows in one day.

06:04.640 --> 06:05.640
Wow.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.640
Geez, that's pretty impressive.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.640
I know.

06:07.640 --> 06:08.640
I don't know what that's like.

06:08.640 --> 06:09.640
Look at you.

06:09.640 --> 06:10.640
Yeah.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.640
You don't know what that's like.

06:11.640 --> 06:16.640
Well, I'm glad you're here, because not only did you attend Ohio Linux Fest with us.

06:16.640 --> 06:17.640
I will.

06:17.640 --> 06:18.640
So we'll get your take.

06:18.640 --> 06:22.040
But there's actually some great interviews Eric got from Seagull about women getting

06:22.040 --> 06:25.360
involved in technology, the makerspace, and coding, and all of that.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.800
So we'll chat about some of those things, because I know that's an area of your interest.

06:28.800 --> 06:32.120
But first, we are joined by an excellent mumble group.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.720
Hey, everybody in the mumble room.

06:33.720 --> 06:34.720
Thanks for being here today.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.720
Hello.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.720
Hello, Eric.

06:36.720 --> 06:37.720
Hello.

06:37.720 --> 06:38.720
Greetings.

06:38.720 --> 06:39.720
I think my adrenal gland is constantly working.

06:39.720 --> 06:40.720
Yeah.

06:40.720 --> 06:41.720
Yeah, probably.

06:41.720 --> 06:42.720
See, Eric was on board.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.720
Eric was on board.

06:43.720 --> 06:44.720
He knew.

06:44.720 --> 06:45.720
Thank you, Eric.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.720
I have so much energy.

06:46.720 --> 06:47.720
Thank you, Eric.

06:47.720 --> 06:48.720
Thank you.

06:48.720 --> 06:49.720
OK, so let's start with some feedback this week before we get into all of the conference

06:49.720 --> 06:50.720
stuff.

06:50.720 --> 06:54.480
So Jor-El wrote in Father of Superman, and he says, hafa'ata, Chris and Matt.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.480
I don't actually know what that means, but I like it.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.000
Is it greetings, maybe?

06:59.000 --> 07:02.360
I saw on last, the one with Ubuntu 14.10 released.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.000
It got me interested enough to check out the changelog myself.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.600
So I head over to the Ubuntu website.

07:06.600 --> 07:10.720
I start to look at the changelog, and I try to find out what's coming up.

07:10.720 --> 07:13.640
However, everything in the changelog seems to be pretty superficial.

07:13.640 --> 07:17.920
In other words, they are giving us words that some people look for, but nothing really specific,

07:17.920 --> 07:21.160
nothing really deep about certain bugs that were fixed or things like that.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.160
So what do you guys think?

07:22.160 --> 07:26.180
How do you dive deeper when you're trying to make a decision on whether or not to upgrade

07:26.180 --> 07:27.320
to the next Linux distribution?

07:27.320 --> 07:29.960
You want to get down to the meat of the details.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.440
You got to sniff stuff out.

07:31.440 --> 07:34.200
Matt, when you're trying to figure out the nitty-gritty between releases, do you have

07:34.200 --> 07:36.960
any tricks to do, any sleuthing?

07:36.960 --> 07:37.960
Not necessarily.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.280
I mean, with any distribution, unless it's a rolling distro and then I just don't care,

07:41.280 --> 07:46.360
but with any distro I actually have to upgrade to, I generally never will make that jump

07:46.360 --> 07:49.960
until it's had at least two or three months out in the open a little bit, kind of let

07:49.960 --> 07:51.880
the stink off a little bit, let it air out.

07:51.880 --> 07:52.880
There you go.

07:52.880 --> 07:58.160
Yeah, that's one way to kind of crowdsource it, in a sense, and let people find stuff.

07:58.160 --> 07:59.160
What do you think, Popey?

07:59.160 --> 08:02.200
Is there maybe a more distribution-specific resource, like say in the case of Ubuntu you

08:02.200 --> 08:03.200
could use?

08:03.200 --> 08:11.000
So yeah, we do have a mailing list called Release Name Changes, and that opens as soon

08:11.000 --> 08:12.300
as the release opens.

08:12.300 --> 08:17.740
So when Trusty opens, there'll be a mailing list called Trusty Changes, and every single

08:17.740 --> 08:22.560
change is in that mailing list, like every bug, every single change, but nobody reads

08:22.560 --> 08:23.560
that.

08:23.560 --> 08:24.560
You wouldn't want to read it.

08:24.560 --> 08:25.560
I mean, what, you could.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.640
You could search the archive, right?

08:27.640 --> 08:28.640
You could, yeah.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.400
It's all public.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.400
You could read that.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.800
Or you could look at the individual change logs for each package.

08:34.800 --> 08:35.800
You could do that.

08:35.800 --> 08:36.800
If you go to packages.ubuntu.com, you could do that.

08:36.800 --> 08:37.800
There you go.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.840
See, I got the sense he was looking for a specific change.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.920
What about like checking the bug tracker?

08:41.920 --> 08:42.920
Is that crazy?

08:42.920 --> 08:44.640
I mean, if he's looking for something specific, right?

08:44.640 --> 08:46.760
Well, the change log links to the bug tracker.

08:46.760 --> 08:50.760
It links to each Launchpad bug that's been fixed, so yeah, you could do that.

08:50.760 --> 08:53.360
So it's a little different distro to distro, so it sounds like that's a good approach for

08:53.360 --> 08:57.580
Ubuntu, and for the most part, there's probably something similar for other distributions

08:57.580 --> 08:58.580
out there.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.320
And I never really think about it that much.

09:01.320 --> 09:04.800
I always do kind of look at the broader changes, but when you get down, when you narrow down,

09:04.800 --> 09:07.240
sometimes you're like, I want to know, is this specific thing solved?

09:07.240 --> 09:08.240
Otherwise, it's not worth my upgrade.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.920
So it was a good question, Joel, and any of you out there in the audience, oh, go ahead.

09:11.920 --> 09:16.920
On FreeBSD, we've actually recently come up with a better solution to this problem, because

09:16.920 --> 09:21.040
nobody's going to read the SVN logs to see every commit that's come in, and so we've

09:21.040 --> 09:25.640
always had release notes, this big document that comes with each version, and it describes

09:25.640 --> 09:27.200
what was changed.

09:27.200 --> 09:32.720
But maintaining that basically ended up with one guy the week before the release going

09:32.720 --> 09:35.280
through the SVN logs, and that became very difficult.

09:35.280 --> 09:40.680
So in our source code control now, when you write your commit message, we have a bunch

09:40.680 --> 09:45.900
of fields that we use by standard in FreeBSD, like approved by this person, or a bug was

09:45.900 --> 09:49.560
found by this person, or this commit was sponsored by this company, or whatever, and there's

09:49.560 --> 09:52.220
now one called release notes, yes.

09:52.220 --> 09:56.080
And when that's there, then you can just compile a list of every change that was significant

09:56.080 --> 10:00.120
enough to need to be noted in the next release notes.

10:00.120 --> 10:04.520
So the developer has to kind of plug in that data?

10:04.520 --> 10:05.520
And they generally do?

10:05.520 --> 10:08.700
So every time somebody makes a change, they note whether they think it's worthy of going

10:08.700 --> 10:10.240
in the release notes for the next version.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.240
Okay.

10:11.240 --> 10:16.120
So yes, it's not foolproof, but they found it helps a lot, because it helps the documentation

10:16.120 --> 10:19.400
team come up with that list of what has actually changed in this next release.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.800
And so there's still a human then that takes sort of that input and then formats it?

10:22.800 --> 10:27.560
Yes, it iterates it into a nicely English-formatted document and breaks down into sections, like

10:27.560 --> 10:30.840
these are the new drivers we got, and these are the new applications we have.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.840
We upgraded KDE to this version.

10:32.840 --> 10:37.280
Yeah, getting the drivers and stuff like that broken out is specifically handy.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.560
If you've ever been in that situation where, and I think, Eric, you've been in this position

10:40.560 --> 10:43.440
where a Linux kernel version comes along, and all of a sudden something that worked

10:43.440 --> 10:47.680
on your laptop before is no longer working right, and it really comes down to a driver.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.680
Yeah.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.480
Didn't that kind of happen to you recently?

10:50.480 --> 10:51.880
Yeah, it did, actually.

10:51.880 --> 10:57.360
When 3, I believe it was 3.15 came out, it actually, my computer would not boot.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.960
It would go into a failed state.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.960
The processor would go into full.

11:01.960 --> 11:05.200
I mean, it would load the kernel and then done.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.600
And part of that, it turned out to be a video driver issue.

11:08.600 --> 11:15.820
They enabled something in the BayTrail video processors, and what they enabled doesn't

11:15.820 --> 11:19.080
work for mine, so it just crashed it.

11:19.080 --> 11:23.840
Luckily, I was able to work with the guys to figure out what happened, and submit a

11:23.840 --> 11:27.160
bug report, and it got fixed with the next version.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.640
So you're okay now?

11:28.640 --> 11:33.840
Oh yeah, everything 3.16, 3.17, no problems.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.520
It was fun talking to folks.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.960
I didn't realize people still play with their Linux kernels.

11:38.960 --> 11:44.080
I met a couple of people at Ohio Linux Fest that kind of, we got on the topic of what

11:44.080 --> 11:47.000
they do to their Linux rigs, and a lot of them were like, yeah, I try out different

11:47.000 --> 11:50.400
stuff, so people are plugging this stuff away just for funsies.

11:50.400 --> 11:53.400
So I think it is more of a topic than we think, if people want to track this stuff.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.400
Hey, I'll tell you about something I want to track.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.400
That's Ting.

11:56.400 --> 12:00.800
Go over right now, I want you to go to linux.ting.com, that's our first sponsor this week, linux.ting.com,

12:00.800 --> 12:04.280
linux.ting.com, and that'll take $25 off your first device.

12:04.280 --> 12:08.520
If you've already got a Ting device, they'll give you a $25 credit for service.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.760
And if you're getting something like a Wi-Fi hotspot, you know, like one of those MyFis,

12:12.760 --> 12:16.000
or you don't use a lot of minutes, that might last you more than a month.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
But it did for me.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.960
I actually got like, I think it was almost my first two months for free.

12:20.960 --> 12:24.680
And Ting's great, because you only pay for what you use, there's no contract.

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
It's $6 a line.

12:25.680 --> 12:28.960
So you want to get a new phone, you want another phone, it's $6, straightforward, and then

12:28.960 --> 12:29.960
it's just your usage.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.840
Ting takes your minutes, your messages, your megabytes, they add them all up.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.680
You want to turn on hotspot and tethering, it's just your data usage.

12:35.680 --> 12:40.360
If you need customer support, you call them, 1-855-TING-FTW, and a real person answers

12:40.360 --> 12:41.360
the phone.

12:41.360 --> 12:45.800
And you know, Ange, I'm coming up on my two-year mark with Ting.

12:45.800 --> 12:46.800
That's pretty awesome.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.800
Yep.

12:47.800 --> 12:48.800
It's kind of crazy.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.960
You know, if you've been thinking about Ting, you should go over to linux.ting.com right

12:50.960 --> 12:51.960
now.

12:51.960 --> 12:52.960
Try out their savings calculator.

12:52.960 --> 12:57.840
Plug in your actual usage, what you pay, and see what it would look like for you.

12:57.840 --> 13:03.040
And it's so handy for me, I'm extremely lucky that I have got fantastic Ting service here

13:03.040 --> 13:04.040
by the studio.

13:04.040 --> 13:08.640
I mean, I did a speed test the other day, I got 18 megabits download on my cell phone.

13:08.640 --> 13:09.640
Wow.

13:09.640 --> 13:10.640
Yeah.

13:10.640 --> 13:15.600
And to that point, you know, there was a time when Allen had flown in for Linux Fest Northwest,

13:15.600 --> 13:19.760
and Comcast, as Comcast do, went down.

13:19.760 --> 13:24.380
And we were able to continue on by turning the hotspot, the tethering actually was the

13:24.380 --> 13:29.000
Wi-Fi hotspotting, on my Nexus 5 on, and we ran off of the Ting connection for the day.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
That's crazy.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.600
Got the show prep done, did all of the visuals off our Ting connection.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.880
It really saved the day.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.880
It's really handy to have.

13:35.880 --> 13:39.040
And the other thing that's great about Ting is that dashboard allows you to turn devices

13:39.040 --> 13:40.040
on and off.

13:40.040 --> 13:43.180
So if you want to have a travel phone, but you don't necessarily need it all the time,

13:43.180 --> 13:44.840
go in there and deactivate the line for a little while.

13:44.840 --> 13:45.840
Same with the MiFi adapters.

13:45.840 --> 13:49.600
If you go to linux.ting.com, you're going to get $25 off the device.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.980
So it's a great way to start.

13:50.980 --> 13:53.120
And they've always got interesting stuff, too, on their blog.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.600
Go to linux.ting.com and then click the blog.

13:55.600 --> 13:59.880
They've got a post up about the internet rockstar Robin Chase joining the board of directors

13:59.880 --> 14:00.880
at Ting.

14:00.880 --> 14:01.880
It's pretty cool.

14:01.880 --> 14:05.480
Robin's from Zipcar, Netflix, Etsy, Skype, you know, you've probably heard a few of those

14:05.480 --> 14:06.480
companies.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.480
Oh, wow.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.480
Yeah, now sitting at the board at Ting.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.480
Geez.

14:09.480 --> 14:10.480
Pretty cool.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.480
Ting's got so many great service.

14:11.480 --> 14:14.600
They've also got a fantastic online community at help.ting.com.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.760
So never again do you have to worry about overages if you go over a date.

14:17.760 --> 14:18.760
There's no limit.

14:18.760 --> 14:19.760
It's just what you use.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.280
You don't have to worry about early termination fees.

14:21.280 --> 14:25.240
And if you're stuck in a contract right now, Ting has early termination relief.

14:25.240 --> 14:29.200
Go to ting.com slash ETF and they'll help you get out of your contract by paying up

14:29.200 --> 14:32.680
to $75 in Ting credits for each line you have to cancel.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.280
And that's going to get you a great Ting service, too, because I've got three smartphones right

14:35.280 --> 14:36.340
now on my Ting plan.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.520
It's around 40, 45 bucks a month for me.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.680
It's a great deal.

14:40.680 --> 14:44.300
Linux.ting.com, mobile that finally makes sense.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.240
Stop letting the carriers take advantage of you and go vote with your wallet.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.240
Linux.ting.com.

14:48.240 --> 14:51.440
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.440
All right.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.000
Well, so we have just a couple more bits of emails to get to, and then I want to get to,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.200
we got five really great interviews that Eric grabbed for us.

14:59.200 --> 15:03.840
But Martin wrote in to celebrate the release of SUSE Linux Enterprise desktop 12.

15:03.840 --> 15:04.840
Woo!

15:04.840 --> 15:05.840
And this is good.

15:05.840 --> 15:09.440
In coming up on this Sunday, we're going to review the new open SUSE.

15:09.440 --> 15:12.360
And I think a lot of this release is going to be influenced by what you see in SLED.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.400
So he says, I'm really excited because SUSE Linux Enterprise desktop 12 just released.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.160
The links he gives us talk about a little bit.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.740
He says, also interesting news.

15:19.740 --> 15:25.360
Just before the open SUSE 3.2 review next Sunday, I'm rocking open SUSE 13.2 for three

15:25.360 --> 15:26.360
weeks.

15:26.360 --> 15:27.360
I've had no problems at all.

15:27.360 --> 15:30.840
I have ButterFS for my file system, XFS for my home directory, a rock-solid release in

15:30.840 --> 15:31.840
my opinion.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.320
Best regards, Martin from the Netherlands.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.400
So there you go.

15:35.400 --> 15:36.840
Pretty exciting.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.600
And one more email before we get to the interviews.

15:39.600 --> 15:43.600
Bruce writes in, and he wants to know something maybe if we can just share a little collective

15:43.600 --> 15:44.600
wisdom guys.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.400
I've been a LastLup fan for a year or so.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.400
He says he distro hops.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.600
He's been doing distro hopping since Red Hat 6.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
He loves to have fun.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.600
He loves to move around.

15:52.600 --> 15:56.540
But he says he's constantly reading and hearing the gospel that the single greatest benefit

15:56.540 --> 15:57.800
of Linux is freedom.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.280
Freedom to slice and dice the way you want to modify it.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.640
To share and distribute.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.520
To change and update.

16:03.520 --> 16:07.840
If that freedom is such a fundamental belief, why are there such protracted and heated debates

16:07.840 --> 16:11.760
on topics like systemd and, before that, canonical immunity?

16:11.760 --> 16:14.720
Where is the respect for the freedom of the people putting their heart and soul into those

16:14.720 --> 16:15.720
developments?

16:15.720 --> 16:19.040
As I see it, they're doing no more than exercising the very freedom the community shouts from

16:19.040 --> 16:22.560
the rooftops, but they seem to draw a lot of flack for doing so.

16:22.560 --> 16:26.260
If the rest don't like the direction those folks are going in, then like me, they can

16:26.260 --> 16:30.680
exercise their freedom and simply use or not use the distro that included those changes.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.680
Ultimately, wouldn't the market decide?

16:32.680 --> 16:37.720
How can a fraternity that preaches freedom not respect others who exercise that freedom

16:37.720 --> 16:39.900
or is it just that haters are going to hate?

16:39.900 --> 16:41.600
Keep up the good work, Bruce.

16:41.600 --> 16:51.480
Does fraternity imply only men?

16:51.480 --> 16:55.400
I think what it comes down to is the Linux community, while it does believe in all of

16:55.400 --> 17:00.960
those things, it also believes in technical merits.

17:00.960 --> 17:06.440
And I think the problem is that when people see technical merits like science facts, it's

17:06.440 --> 17:11.120
hard concrete facts and so to them, if you don't believe in something, you're not accepting

17:11.120 --> 17:15.960
fact and so then people want to try to convince you to accept fact for whatever reason they

17:15.960 --> 17:16.960
have invested in it.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.520
Do you guys think I'm onto something or is that just cray?

17:19.520 --> 17:23.520
I don't know, I wonder.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.600
So we don't know, Bruce, but we think it's just human nature and don't worry, everywhere

17:27.600 --> 17:30.800
there's a noisy person, there's five or six other people that aren't saying anything at

17:30.800 --> 17:33.880
all that aren't making a big fuss and it's just human nature and it's just part of the

17:33.880 --> 17:34.880
fun.

17:34.880 --> 17:35.880
Just part of the fun.

17:35.880 --> 17:36.880
All right.

17:36.880 --> 17:37.880
So let's move on.

17:37.880 --> 17:38.880
We'll keep going.

17:38.880 --> 17:43.080
In fact, you know, unless, does anybody in the Mumba room have any thoughts on how to

17:43.080 --> 17:44.560
get people to simmer down?

17:44.560 --> 17:48.120
I know, Popi, this is an old whipping horse of yours, right?

17:48.120 --> 17:49.880
I have no idea what you're talking about.

17:49.880 --> 17:50.880
Yeah, of course.

17:50.880 --> 17:51.880
All right.

17:51.880 --> 17:56.440
Well, we got a whole batch of interviews to get into, so let's do one more sponsor spot

17:56.440 --> 17:57.560
before we get to those.

17:57.560 --> 17:58.560
I want to thank DigitalOcean.

17:58.560 --> 18:03.240
Let's go over to DigitalOcean.com right now, everybody, DigitalOcean.com and use the promo

18:03.240 --> 18:04.240
code unpluggedoctober.

18:04.240 --> 18:08.640
You've got a little bit of time left, so why not go apply to your account right now.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.960
Unpluggedoctober, all one word, lowercase.

18:10.960 --> 18:11.960
So what is DigitalOcean?

18:11.960 --> 18:13.520
Ange, do you know what DigitalOcean is?

18:13.520 --> 18:14.520
Yeah.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.040
It's DigitalOcean's that make sense.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.760
Here, read that top.

18:18.760 --> 18:19.760
Go for it.

18:19.760 --> 18:20.760
I want to hear how you do.

18:20.760 --> 18:24.560
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

18:24.560 --> 18:26.600
easy way to spin up a cloud server.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.600
Hey-oh!

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
That's right.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.200
And users can get started in less than 55 seconds.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.800
Some of you are doing about 30 seconds or so.

18:32.800 --> 18:33.800
And guess what?

18:33.800 --> 18:38.360
The cloud hosting plan started only $5 per month, and that's going to get you 512 megabytes

18:38.360 --> 18:42.200
of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, because they're all SSDs.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.200
What's up?

18:43.200 --> 18:44.920
One CPU and a terabyte of transfer.

18:44.920 --> 18:49.080
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

18:49.080 --> 18:50.080
and London.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.440
But Ange, I've got to tell you about that interface.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.440
It's simple.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.440
It's intuitive.

18:54.440 --> 18:57.160
And power users can replicate it on the straightforward API like you do all the time.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.160
Awesome.

18:58.160 --> 19:00.320
You're always implementing it on that API.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.520
And I want you to go over to DigitalOcean right now and just check out their interface.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.200
They've got a demo on their front page.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.560
Just scroll down a little bit and look at that UI.

19:06.560 --> 19:07.560
That's not a mock-up.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.440
That's actually what their interface looks like.

19:09.440 --> 19:13.420
That's the UI you use to spin up KVM virtual machines in data centers all over the world

19:13.420 --> 19:18.200
that you can migrate, take snapshots, do DNS management, have HTML5 console access.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.840
It's incredible.

19:19.840 --> 19:20.840
Just go look at it.

19:20.840 --> 19:23.280
Just go put your face up against the screen and just be amazed.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.440
I am all the time.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.440
And DigitalOcean's getting even better with their new community tutorials.

19:27.440 --> 19:32.040
In fact, they'll pay you $100, $200 to write a tutorial for DigitalOcean.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.320
And don't even worry.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.320
They're going to help you hit the easy button.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.720
They've got an editing staff that will work with you to make sure you look smart and that

19:37.720 --> 19:39.440
you don't spell things wrong like I do.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.440
Right?

19:40.440 --> 19:41.500
That's a big problem.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.500
And I understand.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.500
And DigitalOcean does too.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.760
So they've got editors that work with you.

19:44.760 --> 19:48.840
You write up a good tutorial, they're going to give you like $200 or something like that.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.280
They're going to pay you appropriately, I'm sure.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.960
If you write crap, I'll personally write in there and ask them not to pay you $200.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.920
I don't know if they'll go for it, but that'll be my mission life, so do a good job.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.520
But they'll work with you, so that way it's great, I'm sure.

19:59.520 --> 20:01.780
Go over to DigitalOcean.com right now.

20:01.780 --> 20:05.640
Buy the promo code UnpluggedOctober, spin up a droplet and try something out.

20:05.640 --> 20:10.720
GitLab, WordPress, BitTorrent Sync, OwnCloud 7, all of these things that we talk about

20:10.720 --> 20:11.720
all the time.

20:11.720 --> 20:14.780
Docker, CoreOS, anything like that.

20:14.780 --> 20:19.160
Go have some fun and educate yourself because you can do it for two months for absolutely

20:19.160 --> 20:23.360
free when you use our promo code UnpluggedOctober, you're going to get a $10 credit.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.360
It's a pretty great service.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.440
I've had them for a while now.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.960
They run some of the back end infrastructure for Jupiter Broadcasting, a lot of the back

20:28.960 --> 20:32.720
end infrastructure for Michael Dominic from Quota Radio for all his clients.

20:32.720 --> 20:37.800
It's a really great service, DigitalOcean.com and thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

20:37.800 --> 20:38.800
Linux Unplugged.

20:38.800 --> 20:44.800
Okay, so now that we got our sponsors out of the way, we can get a whole batch of interviews

20:44.800 --> 20:45.800
done.

20:45.800 --> 20:46.800
So let's just jump right into them.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.700
So Seagull happened October 24th and the 25th.

20:48.700 --> 20:53.260
It's a grassroots technical conference dedicated to spreading awareness and knowledge about

20:53.260 --> 20:57.600
GNU slash Linux and the community and also free Libre open source software all around

20:57.600 --> 20:59.520
that and even hardware.

20:59.520 --> 21:01.760
So it is kind of new, right, Eric?

21:01.760 --> 21:02.760
It's like what?

21:02.760 --> 21:03.760
It's second or third year?

21:03.760 --> 21:05.720
This was his second year, yes.

21:05.720 --> 21:06.720
Okay, yeah.

21:06.720 --> 21:07.720
So it's just getting started.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.200
Eric, how many people would you say?

21:09.200 --> 21:11.120
About 200 people there or what?

21:11.120 --> 21:14.080
I would say about 100 to 200, yeah, easily.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.080
All right.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.600
Well, our first interview is Aaron Peterson.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.400
He's actually a friend of the show.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.520
We met him when we went to our Kubota users meetup and he's the one that put the plasma

21:22.520 --> 21:23.560
cake together.

21:23.560 --> 21:27.880
So we'll start with that and then we'll move right along.

21:27.880 --> 21:28.880
Hi, guys.

21:28.880 --> 21:34.000
I'm here with Aaron Peterson of FreeGeek Seattle and I would just like him to tell us a little

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
bit more about it.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.080
Hi.

21:37.080 --> 21:43.300
FreeGeek Seattle is an organization that will help take old computers and find a good home

21:43.300 --> 21:44.880
for them.

21:44.880 --> 21:53.080
We'll install ethical software on it and we'll teach and train people how to do that at some

21:53.080 --> 21:54.680
of our workshops.

21:54.680 --> 21:59.480
So if you need a computer, you can come to our workshops on Saturdays at the Filipino

21:59.480 --> 22:08.960
Community Center and we will help you work on a computer and at the end of the program,

22:08.960 --> 22:12.600
you can end up with a computer.

22:12.600 --> 22:17.560
So he specifically goes out there and his community works on these old computers that

22:17.560 --> 22:21.600
people turn in and a lot of times, these people will turn in computers and they'll be missing

22:21.600 --> 22:24.600
the hard drive or they'll be missing RAM which people will gut them and then bring them in

22:24.600 --> 22:28.440
so they kind of rebuild them, repurpose them, they get them loaded up with Linux and Libre

22:28.440 --> 22:32.880
Office and you can come in there and work on these computers and then you get to leave

22:32.880 --> 22:33.880
with a computer.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.040
That was pretty neat.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.040
That is really awesome.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.040
Yeah.

22:38.040 --> 22:41.760
So our next interview is Art from Pogo Linux and Eric, if you have anything you want to

22:41.760 --> 22:44.200
say, I need to just jump in but I thought we'd do these first ones kind of quick because

22:44.200 --> 22:45.640
they're kind of our short ones.

22:45.640 --> 22:46.640
Oh yeah, totally.

22:46.640 --> 22:51.840
This is Art from Pogo Linux who we visited a while back for How To Linux.

22:51.840 --> 22:57.440
Now you guys might remember from How To Linux Episode 3, we last spoke to people at Pogo

22:57.440 --> 22:58.440
Linux.

22:58.440 --> 23:02.680
So I'm here with Art from Pogo Linux, here to talk to him about some of the developments

23:02.680 --> 23:04.400
they've had since then.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.360
So Art, what can you tell us?

23:06.360 --> 23:13.920
Well, we've been busy with a lot of stuff, a lot of new marketing things including this

23:13.920 --> 23:15.160
show.

23:15.160 --> 23:18.320
We love Seagull, we love supporting the open source community.

23:18.320 --> 23:22.480
Right, it wasn't too far for you to go across the water either.

23:22.480 --> 23:26.800
So what kind of products can you highlight for us real quick to tell us about people

23:26.800 --> 23:28.720
who might be interested in some servers?

23:28.720 --> 23:35.600
Oh yeah, I mean we have our huge line of servers and storage solutions and all the way up from

23:35.600 --> 23:39.600
a tiny 1U to a full on cluster, whatever you need.

23:39.600 --> 23:46.880
But the fun thing to talk about right now, at least I find it fun so maybe you will too,

23:46.880 --> 23:51.800
is we're working on a silent workstation.

23:51.800 --> 23:56.680
We can't really say it's silent, but it's so close to silent that it might as well be.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.960
Like in terms of decibels, where are we talking about?

23:59.960 --> 24:06.480
Like right around the noise floor of a typical room, like below a conversation level, below

24:06.480 --> 24:08.160
a whisper almost.

24:08.160 --> 24:13.080
So we're talking if sometimes, I'm assuming it's water cooled, is that correct?

24:13.080 --> 24:14.080
Absolutely.

24:14.080 --> 24:17.920
Okay, so in terms of water cooled solutions, sometimes they sound a little bit like a refrigerator.

24:17.920 --> 24:23.080
I've heard that a few times with some very quiet fans on top.

24:23.080 --> 24:25.260
How does it compare to that?

24:25.260 --> 24:33.720
It's even quieter because it's a newer setup and it is designed to be as close to silent

24:33.720 --> 24:36.520
as they can possibly manage.

24:36.520 --> 24:43.160
And the fans are all specifically designed for that and I think it's pretty impressive.

24:43.160 --> 24:47.360
Hey Ange, I want a water cooled workstation.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.520
Yeah, that would be awesome.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.600
I noticed Linux Fest Northwest was there.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.600
That's awesome.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
Were they?

24:53.600 --> 24:54.600
Did you see them in the background?

24:54.600 --> 24:55.600
Yeah, that was the totem pole right there.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.600
Yeah, that was them, wasn't it?

24:57.600 --> 24:58.600
Yeah, they were there.

24:58.600 --> 25:02.960
They were right next to Pogo Linux and they were there just to support Seagull and try

25:02.960 --> 25:04.200
to help them get going.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.160
Yeah, well you know what else is cool, Eric?

25:06.160 --> 25:08.520
Pogo Linux was in Ohio at the same time.

25:08.520 --> 25:09.520
Yeah, they were.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.080
Yeah, Art was telling me that.

25:11.080 --> 25:13.400
Yeah, they had a booth there.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.440
So they really hustle, I guess.

25:15.440 --> 25:16.440
Yeah.

25:16.440 --> 25:20.840
So they didn't happen to have that workstation there for demo, did they, Eric?

25:20.840 --> 25:22.480
They did not have it there for demo.

25:22.480 --> 25:26.260
They pretty much just had the table with a bunch of stickers and brochures, but that's

25:26.260 --> 25:27.260
about it.

25:27.260 --> 25:28.260
I'm all about silent.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.600
I'm all about that silent these days.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.320
So I'll be curious to see how that goes.

25:32.320 --> 25:35.200
And they're in our neck of the woods, so maybe we can go down there and see what's up in

25:35.200 --> 25:36.200
a little while.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.200
Yeah.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.200
Okay.

25:38.200 --> 25:44.280
So if you know anything about me, you know I love the idea of people taking the power

25:44.280 --> 25:46.560
of the internet on their own, a mesh network.

25:46.560 --> 25:51.000
You don't need the man, you don't need Comcast, we'll all just individually connect to each

25:51.000 --> 25:55.720
other and blanket the world in mesh networking, maybe.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.600
And I guess you got to start somewhere, so why not in Seattle?

25:58.600 --> 26:01.080
So here's Dan from the Seattle MeshNet.

26:01.080 --> 26:06.360
Hi, I'm here with Dan Ryan of the Seattle MeshNet, and he's going to tell us a little

26:06.360 --> 26:07.440
bit more about that.

26:07.440 --> 26:11.880
So Dan, what can you tell us about the Seattle MeshNet, how it works and whatnot?

26:11.880 --> 26:19.600
Well, basically the Seattle MeshNet is a community-owned and run network, and we use wireless radios

26:19.600 --> 26:28.400
like this one right here to go and create a network between households and office buildings.

26:28.400 --> 26:32.400
We use a routing protocol called CJDNS to hook it all together.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.800
And that's basically what it is, you know?

26:34.800 --> 26:35.800
Cool.

26:35.800 --> 26:40.160
So the way I'm understanding this is it's basically a bunch of networks just kind of

26:40.160 --> 26:45.420
communicating with each other so that you're not having to rely so much on one single

26:45.420 --> 26:47.880
internet service provider, is that correct?

26:47.880 --> 26:49.240
Exactly.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.820
That's basically what we do.

26:51.820 --> 26:54.660
There's multiple gateways to the internet that you can use.

26:54.660 --> 26:58.800
People who offer their business class connections, you know, at no cost, you know.

26:58.800 --> 27:03.320
And the eventual idea is you'll have people, you know, operating their own little, I guess

27:03.320 --> 27:07.720
you could call them ISPs, you know, for a couple bucks a month you can get an IP, you

27:07.720 --> 27:11.880
know, and a certain port speed or something like that, you know.

27:11.880 --> 27:12.880
Okay.

27:12.880 --> 27:17.940
So you're using these devices.

27:17.940 --> 27:22.080
It's honestly just people's household networks and business networks all just kind of combined

27:22.080 --> 27:23.840
into one gigantic network.

27:23.840 --> 27:26.280
Are there any security implications with these?

27:26.280 --> 27:31.320
Well, it's not really routing their current, like, IPv4 or IPv6 network, you know, out

27:31.320 --> 27:34.040
to the general community, you know.

27:34.040 --> 27:38.680
We have a routing application called CJDNS, and it's actually a full network suite.

27:38.680 --> 27:43.720
It assigns you an IPv6 address using a public-private key pair, you know.

27:43.720 --> 27:47.960
And it goes and, you know, provides you a secure way to communicate with other nodes

27:47.960 --> 27:52.400
by, you know, using Salsa 20 encryption to, you know, create encrypted links, you know,

27:52.400 --> 27:55.400
between you and whoever you connect to, you know.

27:55.400 --> 28:01.840
And so it's encrypted end-to-end, and it's, you know, fairly fast and reliable, you know.

28:01.840 --> 28:07.520
On some of, you know, our worst links, you know, we've tested IPv4 versus CJDNS, and,

28:07.520 --> 28:12.480
you know, the latency difference, you know, one will, you know, take 20 milliseconds,

28:12.480 --> 28:14.040
the other will take two.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.040
Right.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.040
Okay.

28:16.040 --> 28:20.040
So how much would something like this cost to get up and running for the average person,

28:20.040 --> 28:21.520
like average household?

28:21.520 --> 28:26.680
Generally, you know, around $100, you know, right around that mark, yeah.

28:26.680 --> 28:30.040
It's not too bad price-wise, you know, to get set up and running.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.040
Okay.

28:31.040 --> 28:35.720
And if anybody wanted more information, where would they go to find out?

28:35.720 --> 28:45.280
Go to seattlemesh.net, you know, and check out our map at seattlemesh.net slash map.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.840
So there might be a drinking game there.

28:48.840 --> 28:49.840
Okay.

28:49.840 --> 28:52.760
Well, let's not troll our guests.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.520
So did you get a good picture of the hardware, Eric?

28:55.520 --> 28:57.280
Like were you able to hold it?

28:57.280 --> 28:58.920
I was able to hold it.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.920
They had some of it right there, and it's just really a white box.

29:01.920 --> 29:02.960
They have two different ones.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.920
One was a small white box, one was a larger white box.

29:04.920 --> 29:08.580
I'm assuming that had to do with whether or not it had more output or not.

29:08.580 --> 29:12.460
So the idea would be I put one in my place, my neighbor puts one in his place, neighbor

29:12.460 --> 29:15.460
down there puts one in her place, and then we just all kind of extend the network down

29:15.460 --> 29:16.460
there.

29:16.460 --> 29:17.460
Exactly.

29:17.460 --> 29:18.460
I'm ready.

29:18.460 --> 29:19.460
My body is ready for that.

29:19.460 --> 29:22.960
But I feel like we've got to come up with something as an alternative, even if it's

29:22.960 --> 29:24.800
not super great.

29:24.800 --> 29:29.240
The trick with that is making sure that everybody around you is on board with it, otherwise

29:29.240 --> 29:30.800
it doesn't work at all.

29:30.800 --> 29:31.800
Right.

29:31.800 --> 29:32.800
Yes, very much.

29:32.800 --> 29:36.360
But you know, it could be worth it.

29:36.360 --> 29:40.480
If censorship and copyright protection, all this stuff makes the web a mess, even if we

29:40.480 --> 29:44.640
had to have a mesh network that was like two G-speeds by today's standards, I think if

29:44.640 --> 29:48.080
we could send text and audio, it would be totally, totally worth it.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.080
Well, exactly.

29:49.080 --> 29:52.200
But if you're an RFC or what have you, that doesn't take much bandwidth at all.

29:52.200 --> 29:55.280
Plus, you figure things like torrents and stuff like that, maybe, I don't know how that

29:55.280 --> 29:57.120
would work in a mesh network setup.

29:57.120 --> 30:02.960
I know there's other mesh networking initiatives out there, I just don't know a lot about them.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.520
All you know is a side.

30:04.520 --> 30:06.480
He was really good at speaking.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.800
He didn't seem nervous at all, even though that's a nervous tick.

30:08.800 --> 30:09.800
Sure.

30:09.800 --> 30:10.800
It was really good.

30:10.800 --> 30:17.840
And I can't remember who mentioned it, but there was a meshnet presentation at Ohio Linux

30:17.840 --> 30:18.840
Fest as well.

30:18.840 --> 30:22.240
It's a topic that we continue to poke at, but I don't feel like anything ever really

30:22.240 --> 30:23.240
gains traction.

30:23.240 --> 30:26.960
I just think it's really crazy that they were in two places at once.

30:26.960 --> 30:27.960
But I guess we were too.

30:27.960 --> 30:28.960
Yeah, that's true.

30:28.960 --> 30:29.960
Technically.

30:29.960 --> 30:34.200
But doesn't it seem like it can't just be something that's in the house, it almost seems

30:34.200 --> 30:37.780
like it has to be something that's on the mobile too, so that way everybody moving around

30:37.780 --> 30:39.880
is contributing to the network.

30:39.880 --> 30:40.880
I think that helps, yeah, definitely.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.920
Yeah, they didn't really have anything like that, but yeah, definitely.

30:43.920 --> 30:44.920
Okay.

30:44.920 --> 30:47.840
So Eric got a chance to talk to Liz Rush.

30:47.840 --> 30:50.400
She's part of, I think it's called Ada.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.120
It's called the Ada Initiative.

30:53.120 --> 30:56.960
The Ada Initiative, and she's going to tell us about that.

30:56.960 --> 31:02.640
I'm here with Liz Rush of, well, she's going to have to tell you a little bit more about

31:02.640 --> 31:03.640
it.

31:03.640 --> 31:07.160
It's a really cool program for women getting into technology, so here's Liz to tell you

31:07.160 --> 31:08.160
more about that.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.160
Hi, yeah.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.160
I'm Liz.

31:10.160 --> 31:15.180
I'm here from Ada Developers Academy, which is a new program in Seattle.

31:15.180 --> 31:22.360
It's a year-long, non-profit, tuition-free code school for women, and it is a program

31:22.360 --> 31:24.000
that's really industry-driven.

31:24.000 --> 31:30.440
We have companies that sponsor students, and what we do is six months of in-classroom intensive

31:30.440 --> 31:31.440
training.

31:31.440 --> 31:34.440
We work on projects in groups and pairs.

31:34.440 --> 31:40.200
We do test-driven development, pair programming, we learn agile methodologies, and then after

31:40.200 --> 31:46.320
six months, we move on to internships at local companies that have sponsored, and when they're

31:46.320 --> 31:51.040
in the internships, the students are working in small development teams writing production

31:51.040 --> 31:52.040
code.

31:52.040 --> 31:56.800
So, it's kind of like an apprenticeship program where they're actively doing the job that

31:56.800 --> 32:02.000
they're being trained to do, and really, what the point of the program is is to be an alternative

32:02.000 --> 32:07.440
hiring pipeline for companies who are facing a shortage of developers and having difficulties

32:07.440 --> 32:08.920
attracting female talent.

32:08.920 --> 32:09.920
Yeah, that's huge.

32:09.920 --> 32:16.800
Yeah, and then it's also a great way to get really bright, intelligent women into technology

32:16.800 --> 32:20.760
when it hasn't been something that they've been exposed to before.

32:20.760 --> 32:25.520
So a lot of us, I was in the first cohort of women to go through the ADA program, and

32:25.520 --> 32:32.120
a lot of us had interest in technology and clearly the aptitude, but we hadn't ever thought

32:32.120 --> 32:38.400
of it as something that was an option for us, and many of us come from backgrounds in

32:38.400 --> 32:44.080
humanities and liberal arts, and those skills have actually transferred really well into

32:44.080 --> 32:49.240
our new careers as developers because we can bring in these outside skills like public

32:49.240 --> 32:55.740
speaking, understanding users, and really kind of having a different perspective on

32:55.740 --> 32:59.480
technology, and that allows us to be really great developers.

32:59.480 --> 33:05.840
So we're out here today trying to spread the word about ADA and find new women who would

33:05.840 --> 33:10.800
be interested in participating in the program and also companies that would like to sponsor.

33:10.800 --> 33:11.800
Oh, wow.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.280
Yeah, that's a lot of information.

33:13.280 --> 33:21.600
So it looks like companies like Expedia, Zillow, I'm seeing on your sponsor sheet there.

33:21.600 --> 33:26.920
So what kind of rate do you have of hiring?

33:26.920 --> 33:28.200
What's your hiring rate?

33:28.200 --> 33:33.120
Well, our first group of women to go through the program is actually finishing their last

33:33.120 --> 33:44.160
day at internships today, and we have 100% rate of having job offers before graduating.

33:44.160 --> 33:46.880
So that seems like a pretty neat initiative and 100% success rate.

33:46.880 --> 33:52.240
I wonder what ADA stands for because when you first said it, I was going to say, wait,

33:52.240 --> 33:54.560
American with Disabilities Act?

33:54.560 --> 33:57.880
Because ADA Developers Academy, it's actually a recursive acronym.

33:57.880 --> 33:58.880
Okay.

33:58.880 --> 33:59.880
Oh, yeah.

33:59.880 --> 34:00.880
Okay.

34:00.880 --> 34:03.640
So yeah, it's almost certainly refers to ADA Lovelace.

34:03.640 --> 34:04.640
Yeah.

34:04.640 --> 34:05.640
Okay.

34:05.640 --> 34:06.640
That too.

34:06.640 --> 34:07.640
Yeah.

34:07.640 --> 34:08.640
So this is interesting.

34:08.640 --> 34:09.640
You know, it's funny.

34:09.640 --> 34:10.640
You see mixed results in the chat room.

34:10.640 --> 34:13.080
Some people think, well, it's not necessary to have something specific just to women.

34:13.080 --> 34:17.960
But I would argue against that just based on the track record we have so far.

34:17.960 --> 34:23.440
And are the people who are saying that possibly middle class white men?

34:23.440 --> 34:24.440
Maybe.

34:24.440 --> 34:25.440
I mean, I don't.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.440
Does it matter?

34:26.440 --> 34:27.440
Almost certainly.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.440
Yeah, of course.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.440
I suppose.

34:29.440 --> 34:30.440
Yeah.

34:30.440 --> 34:31.440
I guess so.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.440
I guess so.

34:32.440 --> 34:33.440
I guess so.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.440
I guess so.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.440
I guess so.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.040
I think I think people are worried that by by putting people in separate groups and sort

34:37.040 --> 34:40.880
of and giving them special treatment, that that's almost a form of exclusion itself.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.680
And that's kind of what I wanted to get your opinion on.

34:42.680 --> 34:43.920
What do you think about that?

34:43.920 --> 34:49.800
Well, well, the opposite is already true in that, you know, the the industry is already

34:49.800 --> 34:52.120
dominated by white middle class men.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.120
So right.

34:53.120 --> 34:54.120
Yes.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.120
That is already the case.

34:55.120 --> 34:56.120
Right.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.120
Yeah.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.120
Yeah.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.120
That's that's kind of my thing.

34:59.120 --> 35:01.560
And that obviously has failed us dramatically.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.880
So and you're of the fair sex.

35:03.880 --> 35:04.880
What do you think?

35:04.880 --> 35:12.240
I think it's cool to have a specific place for women to go to specifically learn code

35:12.240 --> 35:16.760
where and I know, yeah, a lot of people are like, well, everybody should have the opportunity

35:16.760 --> 35:19.100
and everybody does have the opportunity.

35:19.100 --> 35:25.320
Women can go into other programs and whatever in colleges, but to have one place.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.560
It's about a peer group, isn't it?

35:26.560 --> 35:30.280
I think so, and in learning and in a safe place.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.360
I think it's I think it's a good idea.

35:32.360 --> 35:33.360
Yeah.

35:33.360 --> 35:39.240
And especially knowing that you sorry, go ahead by knowing that you can go somewhere

35:39.240 --> 35:44.160
at knowing you can go somewhere where you're not going to get laid out, latched out, you

35:44.160 --> 35:47.880
know, chatted up, ask for your phone number where you can just get on and do the right

35:47.880 --> 35:49.680
job and hollered at and stuff.

35:49.680 --> 35:50.680
Yeah, exactly.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.740
But not only that, but, you know, look at me.

35:52.740 --> 35:58.580
So I, I have a knack for technology, not, you know, at some pro level, but I have interest

35:58.580 --> 35:59.580
in it.

35:59.580 --> 36:04.200
I've always worked on proprietary software programs, implementation and conversion, you

36:04.200 --> 36:05.440
know, things like that.

36:05.440 --> 36:11.520
I've always done the IT for every company that I've worked for, you know, minor IT troubleshooting.

36:11.520 --> 36:16.200
But I decided when I went to college and got my four year degree, I wanted something that

36:16.200 --> 36:17.200
I could take anywhere.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.200
I got an operate operations.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.200
I'm sorry, a business operations, business administration.

36:21.200 --> 36:25.920
Bachelors in business administration because I could go anywhere with that.

36:25.920 --> 36:29.200
But you know, in hindsight, I have a knack for technology.

36:29.200 --> 36:32.200
So this could be like an opportunity where I could go back.

36:32.200 --> 36:35.520
Do you feel like you just didn't even consider the technology for some reason?

36:35.520 --> 36:38.400
Or was it more of a like strategy approach?

36:38.400 --> 36:46.320
I tried to sit in a technology class in high school, as you know, and it went way over

36:46.320 --> 36:47.320
my head.

36:47.320 --> 36:48.320
And it was a beginning class.

36:48.320 --> 36:51.120
It was like, what, NT4 or something?

36:51.120 --> 36:52.120
Probably back then, yeah.

36:52.120 --> 36:56.360
So, you know, and yeah, and I was the only female in there.

36:56.360 --> 36:58.320
That was a little discouraging.

36:58.320 --> 36:59.520
That did kind of make a difference for you.

36:59.520 --> 37:00.520
Yeah, it did.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.520
It did.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.160
So if you went into a classroom that was maybe full of females.

37:03.160 --> 37:09.140
Yeah, I think, and particularly in the place that I'm at now, being 30, and already have

37:09.140 --> 37:13.800
my four year bachelors, I could do something like an all women's code school and not feel

37:13.800 --> 37:14.800
like...

37:14.800 --> 37:19.720
There's an inferior-like mentality.

37:19.720 --> 37:20.720
Not necessarily...

37:20.720 --> 37:21.720
Inferiority complex.

37:21.720 --> 37:27.680
Yeah, not necessarily intentional, but I would feel bad holding up a class of men because

37:27.680 --> 37:29.560
I'm behind, you know?

37:29.560 --> 37:32.440
I feel like, yes, I would have the disadvantage.

37:32.440 --> 37:38.520
Do you feel like maybe as parents, we could do more to encourage girls to play more with

37:38.520 --> 37:39.520
technology?

37:39.520 --> 37:44.200
And I wonder if it's like initial channeling, like, oh no, this is for the boys and girls

37:44.200 --> 37:45.200
you go...

37:45.200 --> 37:47.340
I'm trying to figure out where it kind of stems from because I think one of the reasons

37:47.340 --> 37:50.440
why when you were in that class in high school, you were behind, is because a lot of the boys

37:50.440 --> 37:56.440
in that class had an innate, like, they had self-taught to get themselves kind of to there.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.760
I don't know, because I was a little more advanced than a lot of...

37:59.760 --> 38:04.280
It's really hard because we grew up in a very rapid technology...

38:04.280 --> 38:08.120
Yeah, you were really savvy online and dialed up and managed all that to find.

38:08.120 --> 38:12.040
It changed really fast, too, so it's really hard to know because, yeah, I did have to

38:12.040 --> 38:16.880
keep up with it, but yeah, I wasn't completely interested in it directly.

38:16.880 --> 38:17.880
Yeah.

38:17.880 --> 38:23.800
All right, so another note along these same lines, Eric talked to the Seattle Attic Community

38:23.800 --> 38:27.600
Workshop, and we'll play that.

38:27.600 --> 38:32.980
I am here with the Seattle Attic Community Workshop.

38:32.980 --> 38:37.040
This is a project I've never heard of before, but I know these guys really are excited to

38:37.040 --> 38:41.560
talk to you about what they're doing, so maybe you guys can introduce yourselves.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.680
First of all...

38:42.680 --> 38:43.680
My name is Audra.

38:43.680 --> 38:48.080
I work with the University of Washington in the Genome Sciences Department.

38:48.080 --> 38:53.120
For Linux, we use a lot of Linux on our clusters and everything, and I also do open source

38:53.120 --> 39:00.360
work with DreamWith, which also runs on Linux using Perl.

39:00.360 --> 39:06.840
My name's Anne, and I am currently between jobs, but I do a lot of data analysis work,

39:06.840 --> 39:09.480
so R and those sorts of things.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.480
I'm Frances.

39:10.480 --> 39:17.800
I'm working with the Wikimedia Foundation right now, and yeah, a lot of fun.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.920
Hi, I'm Paul.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.960
I use Linux at home and at work.

39:22.960 --> 39:26.640
I'm DevOps for a company called Climate.com.

39:26.640 --> 39:33.080
We have a Linux suite on Amazon Web Services, and I do my own home stuff too.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.080
Excellent.

39:34.080 --> 39:42.000
Could you guys just tell us a little bit more about this Seattle Addict Community Workshop?

39:42.000 --> 39:43.600
Yeah.

39:43.600 --> 39:49.680
We felt that there was a gap in the makerspace community for an explicitly feminist makerspace,

39:49.680 --> 39:53.520
and so we're all about teaching people to make all sorts of things.

39:53.520 --> 39:59.160
Some of them are physical, but other things are getting women into doing open source coding.

39:59.160 --> 40:03.800
We've done a couple of hackathons for DreamWith, which is an open source fork of live journal

40:03.800 --> 40:05.560
material.

40:05.560 --> 40:10.880
I would like to run a Git workshop at some point and get some people in to Git, because

40:10.880 --> 40:12.640
I know a lot of people want to learn it.

40:12.640 --> 40:20.240
They've told me, and it can be tricky to pick up on your own because of the UI, and let's

40:20.240 --> 40:21.240
see here.

40:21.240 --> 40:26.520
Eventually, if we get the setup right, I would also like to see if I can't get a chapter

40:26.520 --> 40:29.440
of Black Girls Code to run.

40:29.440 --> 40:37.840
Yeah, around the community that we want to be working towards here isn't one where RTFM,

40:37.840 --> 40:42.040
it's write a better manual together.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.040
I like that line.

40:43.040 --> 40:47.000
It's not RTFM, it's write a better manual together, which I think is inclusive.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.680
It's more in the spirit of open source too.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.680
Yeah, definitely.

40:49.680 --> 40:54.160
I was talking to them a lot afterwards, and they were a pleasure to talk to.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.360
Yeah, so tell me more about them.

40:56.360 --> 41:02.640
Well, basically they have a very feminist bent to their organization, so that's one

41:02.640 --> 41:08.160
thing to keep in mind, but also they seem to really be wanting to proactively go out

41:08.160 --> 41:14.840
there and help other communities become more woman friendly, which is great.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.480
I think that's a huge thing.

41:16.480 --> 41:20.660
So they'll work with other established communities and just sort of, what, maybe advise and consult

41:20.660 --> 41:21.660
a little bit?

41:21.660 --> 41:22.660
Yes, exactly.

41:22.660 --> 41:23.660
And promote.

41:23.660 --> 41:26.560
They gave me all sorts of contact information, which I think was great.

41:26.560 --> 41:27.560
Cool.

41:27.560 --> 41:29.800
So Eric, are you going to go back next year?

41:29.800 --> 41:30.800
Absolutely.

41:30.800 --> 41:31.800
Cool.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.600
I think it was a great experience.

41:33.600 --> 41:36.880
It was a little bit on the smaller side, which was great.

41:36.880 --> 41:41.080
Got to know quite a few people, some of which we'll probably have to make sure is in the

41:41.080 --> 41:42.080
show notes.

41:42.080 --> 41:46.600
Yes, we have a lot more in the show notes, including Eric recorded some of the talks.

41:46.600 --> 41:50.600
We have the audio recording sessions for those, and he also included the YouTube page where

41:50.600 --> 41:54.240
some of the videos are posted, so there's a lot more of Segal in our show notes this

41:54.240 --> 41:55.240
week.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.240
Correct.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.240
Yeah.

41:57.240 --> 42:01.320
And it's going to be, I honestly think it has a lot of potential.

42:01.320 --> 42:06.920
The venue at Seattle Central Community College, not the biggest place, but it has only room

42:06.920 --> 42:11.120
to grow in terms of amount of people getting involved and whatnot.

42:11.120 --> 42:14.280
I feel almost selfish that we have so many great events just in our neck of the woods.

42:14.280 --> 42:15.280
I know.

42:15.280 --> 42:16.280
I know.

42:16.280 --> 42:17.280
I know.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.280
I want to do all the things.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.280
I know, right?

42:19.280 --> 42:20.280
I kind of want to go to this next year.

42:20.280 --> 42:24.520
I think we need to, well we definitely need to have some swag present.

42:24.520 --> 42:27.120
I didn't realize he was going, I would have sent him with some swag.

42:27.120 --> 42:30.040
Yeah, oh yeah, next year for sure.

42:30.040 --> 42:32.860
And it sounded like maybe they'll try to schedule it so it doesn't happen the same weekend as

42:32.860 --> 42:34.400
Ohio Linux Fest, right Eric?

42:34.400 --> 42:36.160
Yeah, they're thinking about it.

42:36.160 --> 42:37.480
It's definitely something in the works.

42:37.480 --> 42:45.040
I did talk to Adam from, he was one of the organizers, and he said that they understand

42:45.040 --> 42:48.920
that there's a timing issue and they do want to do some things to address that.

42:48.920 --> 42:49.920
Very good.

42:49.920 --> 42:52.040
Well, Eric, thank you for going down there and grabbing that for us.

42:52.040 --> 42:55.280
It was great to kind of see how that, and I'm glad we're jumping in on it too while

42:55.280 --> 42:59.360
it's still kind of in the early days so that way we can kind of follow along as they expand,

42:59.360 --> 43:00.360
which we will do.

43:00.360 --> 43:04.840
All right, so we've got the crew here, well some of the crew that was here at Ohio Linux

43:04.840 --> 43:05.840
Fest.

43:05.840 --> 43:09.740
We've got a little more to talk about, plus share some stories and things like that.

43:09.740 --> 43:13.000
So why don't I take a minute and thank Linux Academy.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.760
Go over to Linux Academy right now.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.760
Won't you check them out and get yourself certified.

43:17.760 --> 43:21.560
That's right, go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

43:21.560 --> 43:22.560
Check them out.

43:22.560 --> 43:24.640
They've got all kinds of great courses and features for you to take.

43:24.640 --> 43:28.040
They have step-by-step video courses that you can download and take offline.

43:28.040 --> 43:29.320
Audio as well.

43:29.320 --> 43:30.880
If you're like Seth, you can listen in the shower.

43:30.880 --> 43:33.400
If you're like me, you can listen just on your desktop.

43:33.400 --> 43:35.640
I love the downloadable comprehensive study guides too.

43:35.640 --> 43:38.600
They're manuals you can print out or read on your machine.

43:38.600 --> 43:42.440
You can grab them for Linux, AWS OpenStack, DevOps training, all of that.

43:42.440 --> 43:45.640
Self-paced courses with over 835 videos.

43:45.640 --> 43:46.640
It's kind of nuts.

43:46.640 --> 43:50.840
Linux Academy, in addition to four lab servers, you'll receive access to scenario-based labs

43:50.840 --> 43:51.840
as well.

43:51.840 --> 43:55.040
And this is something really neat they've recently improved is their lab platform now

43:55.040 --> 43:59.300
allows users to have four running Linux servers at one time.

43:59.300 --> 44:01.360
You can have any distribution you would like.

44:01.360 --> 44:06.080
They have over seven and they'll automatically adjust all the courseware to match that distribution.

44:06.080 --> 44:10.240
You get two public host names for each server and you can even assign servers roles.

44:10.240 --> 44:13.920
Let's say you want one to be a DB server and one to be a DNS server for your labs and you

44:13.920 --> 44:16.920
can label the roles in your dashboard to help you remember them.

44:16.920 --> 44:20.440
It's so neat and they spin them up on demand when the courseware requires it.

44:20.440 --> 44:24.080
They've got learning plans so you can automatically select how much availability you have and

44:24.080 --> 44:28.160
they'll generate the courseware with your time budgets, reminders to help you keep on

44:28.160 --> 44:29.800
top of if you're a busy person.

44:29.800 --> 44:33.440
I heard from so many of you out there recently that have really been checking it out and

44:33.440 --> 44:35.160
have been super impressed.

44:35.160 --> 44:38.600
I think the number one thing I hear from folks that check out Linux Academy is, yeah, I heard

44:38.600 --> 44:39.600
of what you said, Chris.

44:39.600 --> 44:40.600
It sounded really great.

44:40.600 --> 44:44.040
I went and signed up and now I'm blown away and I'm never leaving.

44:44.040 --> 44:46.560
That's the best part about your Linux Academy subscription.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.040
You're always going to get the new stuff.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.240
They're always adding new courseware constantly.

44:50.240 --> 44:54.600
You have a group of educators, Linux enthusiasts, and programmers that have come together to

44:54.600 --> 44:58.560
create Linux Academy specifically for the Linux and open source community.

44:58.560 --> 45:02.080
Now they're starting to reach out into other areas that you might find yourself.

45:02.080 --> 45:04.800
Perhaps you're what you might consider a, quote, unquote, DevOps.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.080
Well, they've got whole sets of courseware for you.

45:07.080 --> 45:10.000
Or you need to migrate something to AWS to help you scale.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.480
They'll walk you through scenario-based training so at the end of your training, you feel like

45:14.480 --> 45:16.160
you've actually done it because you have.

45:16.160 --> 45:19.240
They'll spin up an EC2 instance, S3, all of it for you.

45:19.240 --> 45:22.080
They've got live streams and videos so you can ask the educators questions directly.

45:22.080 --> 45:25.560
They've got a powerful community that'll help keep you motivated.

45:25.560 --> 45:27.320
There's so much great stuff.

45:27.320 --> 45:30.000
When I'm over there, I'm constantly checking out the new stuff just to see what piques

45:30.000 --> 45:33.400
my interest, to see how far I get, and to see if I still got the skills.

45:33.400 --> 45:37.320
But if I was working for a nine to five, this is what I'd be doing to help check that box

45:37.320 --> 45:39.440
on my next review to show that I'm progressing.

45:39.440 --> 45:43.260
And if I was still contracting, this is how I would keep my skills sharp, even when I'm

45:43.260 --> 45:48.080
not working with a client that's particularly scratching any itch that might be up and coming.

45:48.080 --> 45:52.600
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, say, why don't you go over to Linux Academy right now,

45:52.600 --> 45:54.080
check them out.

45:54.080 --> 45:56.800
I talk to them from time to time about some of the things they have coming up and I cannot

45:56.800 --> 45:59.000
wait to tell you I'm so impressed.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.880
So there's never been a better time to go to Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and save

46:02.880 --> 46:05.760
33% on your quarter.

46:05.760 --> 46:06.760
That's a great deal.

46:06.760 --> 46:10.280
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

46:10.280 --> 46:14.960
Okay, so, Colonel Linux, you still here, did we, I haven't heard you for a while, are you

46:14.960 --> 46:15.960
still here?

46:15.960 --> 46:16.960
I'm still here.

46:16.960 --> 46:17.960
Good, alright, good.

46:17.960 --> 46:21.600
And just here, we don't have Producer Q5 or Blaster, so that's too bad.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.600
Too bad Blaster couldn't join us.

46:23.600 --> 46:24.920
I see he's up and quiet listening.

46:24.920 --> 46:25.920
There you go, hey there Blaster.

46:25.920 --> 46:26.920
There he is.

46:26.920 --> 46:27.920
You have audio with you Blaster?

46:27.920 --> 46:28.920
Yes I do.

46:28.920 --> 46:29.920
Okay, very good.

46:29.920 --> 46:32.160
So, it's not great audio, so we won't talk too much.

46:32.160 --> 46:36.880
But it's okay, we're glad you're here Blaster.

46:36.880 --> 46:41.720
Blaster joined us as part of the crew at Ohio Linux Fest and he drove up in style.

46:41.720 --> 46:42.720
It was pretty, he was like a boss.

46:42.720 --> 46:43.720
What?

46:43.720 --> 46:44.720
What are you going to say?

46:44.720 --> 46:45.720
The Instagram picture of the crew.

46:45.720 --> 46:46.720
Oh, of the crew?

46:46.720 --> 46:47.720
Yeah, I should totally pull that up, huh?

46:47.720 --> 46:48.720
Yeah.

46:48.720 --> 46:49.720
Yeah, that was a great one.

46:49.720 --> 46:53.840
Yeah, Ange got a group selfie and you know what everybody noticed from that group selfie?

46:53.840 --> 46:54.840
What?

46:54.840 --> 46:55.840
Q5's Mohawk.

46:55.840 --> 46:56.840
Yeah.

46:56.840 --> 46:58.840
Who couldn't notice that thing?

46:58.840 --> 47:00.660
That was awesome.

47:00.660 --> 47:02.360
Noah's of course Google Glass.

47:02.360 --> 47:03.360
Oh, and his boss.

47:03.360 --> 47:04.360
Yeah, his boss.

47:04.360 --> 47:05.360
Boss face.

47:05.360 --> 47:06.360
Right there.

47:06.360 --> 47:13.000
So, the crew got in throughout a couple of days, but Ange and I got there Friday and

47:13.000 --> 47:16.840
we immediately went out to the Tilted Skirt, which is, how would you describe the Tilted

47:16.840 --> 47:17.840
Skirt Ange?

47:17.840 --> 47:20.320
It is like...

47:20.320 --> 47:21.960
It's like Hooters but better.

47:21.960 --> 47:28.800
Well, it's the cute little plaid skirt with a matching, not bra.

47:28.800 --> 47:29.800
Bikini top.

47:29.800 --> 47:30.800
There you go.

47:30.800 --> 47:34.440
With the schoolgirl white, you know, Britney Spears.

47:34.440 --> 47:35.440
Short jacket.

47:35.440 --> 47:36.680
Yeah, short jacket that ties.

47:36.680 --> 47:37.680
Tied underneath the bikini.

47:37.680 --> 47:38.880
Yeah, underneath the bikini.

47:38.880 --> 47:42.680
But you were pleasantly surprised that also the male wore a similar attire.

47:42.680 --> 47:47.160
Yeah, the men wore, well, it didn't show as much skin, but yes, they did wear kilts.

47:47.160 --> 47:48.160
Yeah, yeah.

47:48.160 --> 47:51.160
So, we get into town and that's where we went.

47:51.160 --> 47:54.440
That was our first impression of Columbus, Ohio, was the Tilted Kilt.

47:54.440 --> 47:55.800
I'd never been to one before.

47:55.800 --> 47:56.800
Me either.

47:56.800 --> 47:57.800
And the food is actually pretty good.

47:57.800 --> 47:58.800
Yeah.

47:58.800 --> 47:59.800
It was a long time ago.

47:59.800 --> 48:00.800
No.

48:00.800 --> 48:01.800
No, they were pretty weak drinks.

48:01.800 --> 48:02.800
Which is weird.

48:02.800 --> 48:07.400
We're like, Ange and I, so this was in like six years, the first time we've gotten out

48:07.400 --> 48:09.120
on just her and I without the kids.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.120
It wasn't really a vacation.

48:10.120 --> 48:11.120
It was work, but...

48:11.120 --> 48:12.120
Let me put another caveat to that.

48:12.120 --> 48:13.120
Okay.

48:13.120 --> 48:17.680
I didn't find out that I even really liked alcohol until about three years ago after

48:17.680 --> 48:19.400
Abby was done breastfeeding.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.280
That's when I started drinking wine.

48:21.280 --> 48:25.680
Anyway, so yeah, so six years ago, I wasn't interested in alcohol anyway, but we haven't

48:25.680 --> 48:26.680
been out.

48:26.680 --> 48:28.160
So, that was night one.

48:28.160 --> 48:31.360
Night two was crazy.

48:31.360 --> 48:37.520
Night two, downtown Columbus went Halloween, and I believe all of the adults in the city

48:37.520 --> 48:38.520
were there.

48:38.520 --> 48:39.520
They dressed up.

48:39.520 --> 48:40.520
There was crazy costumes.

48:40.520 --> 48:42.600
They shut down streets.

48:42.600 --> 48:46.160
It ended up making us drive around in circles for a while.

48:46.160 --> 48:47.160
So that...

48:47.160 --> 48:48.160
Well, yeah.

48:48.160 --> 48:50.440
Well, some of that was Noah's fault, I guess.

48:50.440 --> 48:51.880
But no, no judging, Noah.

48:51.880 --> 48:52.880
No judging.

48:52.880 --> 48:53.880
It was all good.

48:53.880 --> 48:55.480
But it was a really good time.

48:55.480 --> 48:57.680
Noah, you go to these fests all the time.

48:57.680 --> 48:58.680
Let's start with you.

48:58.680 --> 49:00.880
What was your impressions of Ohio Linux Fest overall?

49:00.880 --> 49:03.760
Well, first of all, we'll start out with saying this.

49:03.760 --> 49:07.080
I am not shy about admitting that I am, in fact, directionally challenged.

49:07.080 --> 49:08.080
Who, you?

49:08.080 --> 49:13.440
Eric, you've never been in a car with me, how would you know?

49:13.440 --> 49:14.440
Have you?

49:14.440 --> 49:15.440
Yeah, I have.

49:15.440 --> 49:16.440
Oh, that's right.

49:16.440 --> 49:17.440
Back in Portland.

49:17.440 --> 49:18.440
OzCon.

49:18.440 --> 49:20.440
So, I judge every conference.

49:20.440 --> 49:25.040
I think the guy from the Ohio open source group said it best.

49:25.040 --> 49:29.720
I judge a conference, its quality, based on how many ThinkPads I see.

49:29.720 --> 49:30.720
Right.

49:30.720 --> 49:37.440
And I saw very few MacBooks, comparatively speaking, and a ton of ThinkPads, which made

49:37.440 --> 49:38.440
me really happy.

49:38.440 --> 49:39.840
And those ThinkPads are running Linux.

49:39.840 --> 49:43.640
Yeah, a lot of actual Linux users there, which was a nice change.

49:43.640 --> 49:44.640
You're right.

49:44.640 --> 49:46.760
And what do you think about the size, Noah?

49:46.760 --> 49:51.920
So I thought that the size was a little disappointing based on reports that I'd heard from other

49:51.920 --> 49:52.920
people.

49:52.920 --> 49:57.640
And it was funny, because all the people that said, oh well, Ohio is this great thing, and

49:57.640 --> 50:01.120
you have to go to it, and this, that, and the other, were people from Self, who had

50:01.120 --> 50:03.600
met at Self, who came to Ohio.

50:03.600 --> 50:07.000
But they're also at Self, in addition to a bunch of other cool people from Self.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
Yeah.

50:08.000 --> 50:15.320
Yeah, well, in my experience, Linux Fest has anywhere between 40 and 60 or so booths, usually,

50:15.320 --> 50:16.320
right?

50:16.320 --> 50:19.000
And this place had like 15.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.680
But they focused more on talks.

50:21.680 --> 50:24.720
They had a fairly full talk schedule, at least for Saturday.

50:24.720 --> 50:29.840
I think Friday was a little sparingly.

50:29.840 --> 50:33.440
Saturday was pretty good, but Sunday was definitely, yeah.

50:33.440 --> 50:34.440
Saturday was good.

50:34.440 --> 50:35.440
Yeah, that's for sure.

50:35.440 --> 50:36.440
Sunday was spare.

50:36.440 --> 50:37.440
It was just mostly tests.

50:37.440 --> 50:38.440
Yeah.

50:38.440 --> 50:40.860
I concur with everything you guys are saying.

50:40.860 --> 50:44.760
It was smaller than I expected, based on sort of the feedback I'd gotten from the audience.

50:44.760 --> 50:45.760
Yep.

50:45.760 --> 50:49.320
However, a lot of people came because they knew we were there, which is really cool.

50:49.320 --> 50:55.960
That's my point, is to me, it sort of demonstrated a pretty fundamental lack of marketing on

50:55.960 --> 50:56.960
...

50:56.960 --> 50:57.960
Absolutely.

50:57.960 --> 50:58.960
Yeah.

50:58.960 --> 51:04.440
Because a lot... I would say 250, 300 people told me, I heard about it on Last.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.320
I didn't know about it until I heard about it on Last.

51:06.320 --> 51:11.040
Now, when you figure there might have been, I don't know, 600, 700, 800 people there, that

51:11.040 --> 51:15.560
is a ridiculous number of people that did not know about it before the show.

51:15.560 --> 51:17.000
And they need to market better.

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Yep.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
Yep.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Yeah.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.560
Some of the people that had booths there saw enough Linux action show jackets, unfiltered

51:24.560 --> 51:31.060
Coder radio shirts, Last 300 shirts, that they know where they need to go now.

51:31.060 --> 51:33.320
We did have some bugs in our hotel room.

51:33.320 --> 51:34.320
Lady bugs.

51:34.320 --> 51:35.320
Yeah.

51:35.320 --> 51:36.320
Oh, wow.

51:36.320 --> 51:37.320
It was infested.

51:37.320 --> 51:38.320
They were our pets.

51:38.320 --> 51:39.320
It was not infested.

51:39.320 --> 51:40.320
Well, it was actually infested.

51:40.320 --> 51:41.320
It was, too.

51:41.320 --> 51:42.320
There was maybe a-

51:42.320 --> 51:43.320
Dude.

51:43.320 --> 51:46.360
Towards our last day, there was maybe a dozen in our room.

51:46.360 --> 51:48.360
In one area or throughout the entire room?

51:48.360 --> 51:49.920
Well, you know, kind of all over.

51:49.920 --> 51:55.480
They were mainly in the window area, but they're on our nightstand and on the mirror, the lamps,

51:55.480 --> 51:56.480
the ceiling.

51:56.480 --> 51:57.480
I didn't mind, though.

51:57.480 --> 51:58.480
I really didn't actually mind.

51:58.480 --> 51:59.480
Lady bugs, right?

51:59.480 --> 52:00.480
Oh, yeah.

52:00.480 --> 52:01.480
I'm with you.

52:01.480 --> 52:02.480
My wife's got a bad phobia.

52:02.480 --> 52:03.480
We wouldn't have done it.

52:03.480 --> 52:04.480
Chris kept trying.

52:04.480 --> 52:05.480
Chris's idea... You've seen a lampshade, right?

52:05.480 --> 52:06.480
There's four sides of a lampshade.

52:06.480 --> 52:08.760
The top and the bottom are open.

52:08.760 --> 52:12.120
Chris's idea to get rid of the lady bugs was to insert them into the top of the lampshade,

52:12.120 --> 52:15.200
and I don't know exactly what he thought was happening, but he kept getting continually

52:15.200 --> 52:18.680
shocked when they fell back out the bottom side, right back to where they were when he

52:18.680 --> 52:19.680
picked them up.

52:19.680 --> 52:23.160
I just want them to crawl around on the inside and then see their shadows through the lampshade.

52:23.160 --> 52:24.160
It didn't work.

52:24.160 --> 52:25.160
Well, it didn't work.

52:25.160 --> 52:26.840
They did it on their own from time to time.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.240
Angie was worried they'd lie in her mouth.

52:28.240 --> 52:29.240
That's what she was worried about.

52:29.240 --> 52:30.240
Yeah.

52:30.240 --> 52:34.720
Thankfully, I was so exhausted from being up at 4 a.m. on Friday, 5 a.m. on Saturday

52:34.720 --> 52:39.080
that I fell asleep so fast Saturday night.

52:39.080 --> 52:40.680
I didn't even have time.

52:40.680 --> 52:46.680
Getting back to more on the conference itself, the best thing I think I saw there, other

52:46.680 --> 52:52.120
than the two little 11-year-old kids that I think I got to switch to Linux, was Ruth's

52:52.120 --> 52:53.120
talk.

52:53.120 --> 52:54.120
Yes.

52:54.120 --> 52:56.680
Which I know, and that's coming up a little bit later in a different show or something,

52:56.680 --> 52:57.680
I'm sure.

52:57.680 --> 52:59.720
Well, do they want us posting a keynote talk like that?

52:59.720 --> 53:00.720
Yeah.

53:00.720 --> 53:01.720
They recorded them themselves.

53:01.720 --> 53:02.720
Okay.

53:02.720 --> 53:03.720
All right.

53:03.720 --> 53:04.720
Do we have a different audio source for that one?

53:04.720 --> 53:05.720
No, unfortunately.

53:05.720 --> 53:06.720
Okay.

53:06.720 --> 53:07.720
All right.

53:07.720 --> 53:08.720
Sorry.

53:08.720 --> 53:09.720
Okay.

53:09.720 --> 53:10.720
We're going to skip across the room, right?

53:10.720 --> 53:11.720
Yeah.

53:11.720 --> 53:12.720
I watched it though.

53:12.720 --> 53:13.720
Ruth gave an incredible talk.

53:13.720 --> 53:14.720
It was really good.

53:14.720 --> 53:19.960
Well, and so one of the things that she hit on was that as a community, we go to all these

53:19.960 --> 53:25.640
different conferences like OSCON and LinuxCon, and you can't find an example of somebody

53:25.640 --> 53:28.000
using Linux or open source.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.240
Like she actually said in her presentation, I will walk up to a booth and ask, is there

53:32.240 --> 53:37.480
anything open about your project that you say is open source and is at an open source

53:37.480 --> 53:38.480
conference?

53:38.480 --> 53:42.480
And she's a person that actually runs Linux on her laptop, on her desktop.

53:42.480 --> 53:46.000
She works for a Linux organization, but she believes in the concept of open source.

53:46.000 --> 53:49.400
It's not just she believes in making money off of open source.

53:49.400 --> 53:50.480
Right.

53:50.480 --> 53:55.000
And Ruth, she works at Red Hat and she's part of the PyDora project.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.960
And she went up there and I thought she gave some...

53:57.960 --> 54:02.000
You know what I liked about Ruth's talk, and I think this is something that made it really

54:02.000 --> 54:03.040
connect with me.

54:03.040 --> 54:05.400
And so I don't know when we're going to play it because it's long.

54:05.400 --> 54:08.280
It's about 30 minutes, but we will try to play it soon.

54:08.280 --> 54:12.080
And she talks about, she draws parallels to history.

54:12.080 --> 54:15.760
And that to me was the most powerful thing is she can kind of demonstrate in some ways

54:15.760 --> 54:19.600
we've been here before and we have fought these battles.

54:19.600 --> 54:24.000
They were named different things and they were about different things, but the moral

54:24.000 --> 54:26.280
of the stories remain the same as they are today.

54:26.280 --> 54:29.480
And that to me was sort of the most powerful thing about what she did, because when you

54:29.480 --> 54:34.480
look at these historical things and you see how they resolve, it's so obvious with 2020

54:34.480 --> 54:35.480
hindsight.

54:35.480 --> 54:39.680
And so you can apply that same mindset to the problems we're dealing with today.

54:39.680 --> 54:42.080
And you can see she just nailed it so many times.

54:42.080 --> 54:43.720
So that was really good.

54:43.720 --> 54:48.640
And the other thing about Ruth is she was extremely dynamic.

54:48.640 --> 54:52.040
She had a moment where she had to look something up on her computer, so she engaged the audience

54:52.040 --> 54:57.760
and got them to sort of vamp for her while she was filling time.

54:57.760 --> 55:02.880
And she just was so good at handling questions.

55:02.880 --> 55:06.280
She would just ask her a random question about patents and she just had a great answer for

55:06.280 --> 55:07.280
that, I thought.

55:07.280 --> 55:09.480
And I was super impressed by that.

55:09.480 --> 55:11.940
And that was really, I thought, where Ohio Linux Fest shined.

55:11.940 --> 55:16.440
And they also had Ken Starks do a closing talk, which was really interesting as well.

55:16.440 --> 55:23.120
Blaster, did you have anything that you wanted to particularly talk about?

55:23.120 --> 55:24.120
I don't know.

55:24.120 --> 55:31.560
The streets closing down was kind of annoying, but especially when the only way to get into

55:31.560 --> 55:36.480
your hotel, into the valet parking, is to drive the wrong way on a one-way because they

55:36.480 --> 55:40.600
close down the only other street you can use to get to your hotel.

55:40.600 --> 55:42.640
But that also kind of makes you feel like a ninja.

55:42.640 --> 55:43.640
How about the Fest?

55:43.640 --> 55:50.560
I didn't really experience too much of it.

55:50.560 --> 55:53.880
Walking around was a little bit, I mean, once you walk four blocks to get directly across

55:53.880 --> 55:57.840
the street, it's a little bit of a pain to walk everywhere else.

55:57.840 --> 56:00.920
But no, the booths were cool.

56:00.920 --> 56:02.600
I checked out most of them.

56:02.600 --> 56:07.400
The swag was nice, especially those little nerve guns.

56:07.400 --> 56:09.960
And it seemed like everybody was pretty friendly and low-key.

56:09.960 --> 56:10.960
That was great.

56:10.960 --> 56:11.960
Oh yeah, everybody was definitely friendly.

56:11.960 --> 56:15.760
Because there's those conferences that feel a little stressful, a little high-strung like

56:15.760 --> 56:22.840
OSCON versus something like Linux Fest or Ohio Linux Fest that felt a little more relaxed.

56:22.840 --> 56:28.800
One thing that I did notice about a difference between Linux Fest and this Fest is that this

56:28.800 --> 56:35.320
one felt like more people were driving just a couple hours to stop by, see it, and leave.

56:35.320 --> 56:39.080
Whereas with Linux Fest, people flying in, they're staying in a hotel.

56:39.080 --> 56:44.320
So while there's that, you'd think if you're staying in a hotel by Linux Fest Northwest,

56:44.320 --> 56:47.080
you'd be casual and not rushed and stressed or whatever.

56:47.080 --> 56:51.560
But I felt like there was less, people were more casual.

56:51.560 --> 56:54.720
Because they were on their own time, they were on their own schedule or something.

56:54.720 --> 56:56.480
Yeah, it was really, really interesting.

56:56.480 --> 57:02.280
But there were a lot of people nearby that just drove anywhere between two and eight

57:02.280 --> 57:03.280
hours.

57:03.280 --> 57:04.280
Yeah.

57:04.280 --> 57:05.920
And it was always a good sign.

57:05.920 --> 57:09.600
Like you get in there and they're using Linux there at the Fest organizers themselves.

57:09.600 --> 57:10.960
You check in at a Linux box.

57:10.960 --> 57:13.440
All of that's always a good sign too for a conference.

57:13.440 --> 57:15.800
So it was all in all a great trip.

57:15.800 --> 57:19.880
It was a little smaller than I expected, but once I adjusted that, I appreciated the fact

57:19.880 --> 57:23.000
that it gave us the time to connect with people.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.720
I met a lot of people.

57:24.720 --> 57:27.920
It was really, really neat to meet that many people.

57:27.920 --> 57:29.020
And I want to do it more often.

57:29.020 --> 57:32.680
So we're already talking about the next conferences we're going to go to, obviously Linux Fest

57:32.680 --> 57:33.680
Northwest.

57:33.680 --> 57:34.680
You can put that in your calendar.

57:34.680 --> 57:35.680
Yep.

57:35.680 --> 57:36.680
We're talking very seriously about scale.

57:36.680 --> 57:37.680
I think we want to do that.

57:37.680 --> 57:38.680
Yep.

57:38.680 --> 57:39.680
Self.

57:39.680 --> 57:40.680
Chase might even want to join us for scale.

57:40.680 --> 57:41.680
Self.

57:41.680 --> 57:44.040
Self sounds like it's a must do as well.

57:44.040 --> 57:45.040
More and more events.

57:45.040 --> 57:47.200
So we're going to just try to get our shows covering more and more of this stuff for those

57:47.200 --> 57:48.400
of you who can't make it.

57:48.400 --> 57:55.720
I think what I've discovered in these trips is that this aspect is more important than

57:55.720 --> 57:59.400
I think I've appreciated for an open source community.

57:59.400 --> 58:02.440
Actually connecting with people, talking about these problems, seeing how people are using

58:02.440 --> 58:07.240
technology and the amazing, interesting things people are doing.

58:07.240 --> 58:11.560
I saw a project that was actually running on a Sega Genesis that somebody is making

58:11.560 --> 58:15.120
software today for a Sega Genesis and running their own custom stuff.

58:15.120 --> 58:19.960
And they're using open source tools to do things that I never even thought people would

58:19.960 --> 58:21.400
ever have a desire to do.

58:21.400 --> 58:25.760
And then you see it and you realize why sometimes we have such strange and esoteric things.

58:25.760 --> 58:30.880
And it was really fun to kind of see practical implementations and uses of Linux, open source,

58:30.880 --> 58:31.880
talk to people.

58:31.880 --> 58:35.220
I talked to some sys admins about the things they're struggling with.

58:35.220 --> 58:36.760
We shared some war stories.

58:36.760 --> 58:37.760
All of that.

58:37.760 --> 58:42.480
Just that level of connecting when the community itself is inherently a collaboration community

58:42.480 --> 58:43.480
I think is super important.

58:43.480 --> 58:45.320
So I want to attend more of them.

58:45.320 --> 58:47.160
So I think we're going to do that.

58:47.160 --> 58:49.200
Any other closing thoughts you guys on Ohio?

58:49.200 --> 58:50.200
No?

58:50.200 --> 58:53.720
Were there any biohazard suits?

58:53.720 --> 58:54.720
Only for Halloween.

58:54.720 --> 58:55.720
What?

58:55.720 --> 58:56.720
No?

58:56.720 --> 58:57.720
Biohazard suits?

58:57.720 --> 58:58.720
Oh, no.

58:58.720 --> 58:59.720
We did see...

58:59.720 --> 59:00.720
No, but you know what?

59:00.720 --> 59:01.720
Funny story.

59:01.720 --> 59:07.000
When we did have to run to our connecting flight, we both, because we had so much adrenaline

59:07.000 --> 59:10.920
and we had just gotten off a flight so our legs weren't working super well.

59:10.920 --> 59:11.920
And we had our bags.

59:11.920 --> 59:13.200
Yeah, we had our bags.

59:13.200 --> 59:16.640
We were coughing like crazy once we got on the plane.

59:16.640 --> 59:17.640
For about an hour.

59:17.640 --> 59:18.640
Yeah, so...

59:18.640 --> 59:23.240
And I immediately, in the second cough, I'm like, oh God, I bet the guy next to me thinks

59:23.240 --> 59:25.080
that I'm contagious or something.

59:25.080 --> 59:27.320
And so I'm like, look, I'm not sick.

59:27.320 --> 59:32.740
We just had to run and it's causing an asthmatic adrenaline reaction.

59:32.740 --> 59:35.160
So it'll stop soon, hopefully.

59:35.160 --> 59:36.160
Yeah.

59:36.160 --> 59:37.160
It was nuts.

59:37.160 --> 59:39.120
And then I was glad we had a couple hours to rest on a plane.

59:39.120 --> 59:40.120
Yeah.

59:40.120 --> 59:41.120
Four and a half.

59:41.120 --> 59:42.120
Yeah.

59:42.120 --> 59:43.120
Yeah, that is true.

59:43.120 --> 59:44.120
Yeah.

59:44.120 --> 59:47.600
I'd say if you've considered it, go and if you can make it a business expense, even better.

59:47.600 --> 59:48.600
Or get your work to pay for it.

59:48.600 --> 59:49.600
Yeah.

59:49.600 --> 59:50.600
Exactly.

59:50.600 --> 59:51.600
There's a lot of people that have done that.

59:51.600 --> 59:52.600
Yep.

59:52.600 --> 59:53.600
Especially at OSCON, but even a few here at Ohio.

59:53.600 --> 59:54.600
Yep.

59:54.600 --> 59:55.600
And it was neat to see Columbus.

59:55.600 --> 59:56.600
I don't know what...

59:56.600 --> 59:58.560
I still don't know what dot in the I in Ohio is, but...

59:58.560 --> 59:59.560
Faux-Hio.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.560
Faux-Hio it is.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.560
And we might have some more.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.560
Do you think we'll have a little more in the Faux show?

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.560
Speaking of Faux?

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.600
Yeah, because we're doing Jacket Awards on the 2nd, which is this Sunday.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.880
And yeah, for a second there, I thought I was on last.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:16.280
The Linux Action Show Jackets pictures in the Faux show following Linux Action Show

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.280
on Sunday.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.280
Mm-hmm.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.240
And we'll show some more pictures and stuff like that from our trip.

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.400
I've got some pictures that aren't on the Instagram feed we could show.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.400
Me too.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.400
Just a couple, but yeah.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:25.400
Yeah.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400
So we'll do some more stuff in there too.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:30.360
So we'll have a little itsy bitsy more Ohio stuff just from the community aspect in the

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.240
Faux show this Sunday, which will immediately follow the Linux Action Show on the live stream.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.760
So tune in for that if you want any more goodies.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.800
I think that's everything we have for today.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.520
I'm going through our list right now to make sure, but check out the show notes for more

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.000
clips from Seagull, including some of the talks, some of the videos of the keynotes,

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.320
and we have two more things in the kitty that I really want to get from Ohio.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.160
One is Ruth's talk that Noah and I were talking about, and the other is an interview that

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.120
Noah did with Ken Moore, who's creating the Lumina desktop for PCBSD.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.540
It's a brand new desktop, and I think we'll probably fit that into this Sunday's Linux

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:09.680
Action Show to get a little tour of the Lumina desktop.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.520
So we'll have the OpenSUSE review this Sunday, and then I think maybe we'll put at the end

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:19.480
of the show or something like that the walkthrough of the Lumina desktop, which I believe producer

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.080
Q5SIS is currently trying to get to work on Puppy Linux.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.080
Just a little teaser.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:28.720
I got to see Ken play around with it a little bit, and he showed me some stuff, and it looks

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.720
really nice.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:30.720
Yes.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.720
Yeah.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.720
It's very cool.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.320
And the integration of them ZFS features is super sweet.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.640
It's going to make us Linux users totally jelly, so be prepared for that.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.640
All right.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.160
Well, that'll bring us to the end of today's episode, and we're going to get out of here.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.400
If you want to get a hold of us, go over to jupyterbroadcasting.com, click that contact

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:52.080
link, and then choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown, or go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.080
and send us in your feedback.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:57.480
Don't forget to check this week's Fo' Show out for even more coverage, and tune in on

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:03.640
Sunday for the big show for our review of OpenSUSE, and come back next Tuesday for a

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:05.180
brand new edition of Linux Unplugged.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.560
We do this show at 2 p.m. Pacific, and go over to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.760
to have our robots convert that for you.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.920
It's the only thing we allow them to do, so please give them a purpose.

01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:19.960
Visit jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar, because every millisecond that goes by is

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.680
an eternity to them, so don't torture them any longer.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.680
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.520
All right, Matt, I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.520
Sounds good.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.520
See you then.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.520
All right, everyone.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.960
Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.040
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:22.120
Chris, you guys should come over to Europe.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.120
I know.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:24.120
I know.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.120
Boy, yeah.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120
You've got to convince the boss here, Poppy.

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.760
I think that might be a milestone.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:34.800
The biggest European conference is FOSDEM, probably, which is the beginning of February

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.800
next year.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.800
That's way too soon.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.800
Okay.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.800
Darn it.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.800
I know.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:45.880
Plus, we have scale and Linux Fest, and- Yeah, we do not have the funds for Europe

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:46.880
that soon.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.880
Shoot.

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.880
God, I want to.

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.320
I want to so bad, though.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.320
What is the...

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.320
Can you...

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.320
What is the name of the Fest again?

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.320
Can you type it in the chat?

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.320
FOSDEM.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.320
F-O-S-D-E-M.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.320
FOSDEM.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320
Oh, okay.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.320
The biggest.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320
The biggest.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.320
Brussels.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.320
jb titles.com.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.320
We're going years and years and years.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.200
It's a university in Brussels.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.700
It's a fantastic place.

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:08.700
jb titles.com.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:09.700
jb titles.com.

01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:10.700
So, Angela, I got a question for you.

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:11.700
Yeah.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.560
I didn't want to bring this up on air, but...

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.560
You are right now.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.560
You know that, right?

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:16.560
Well, now the show's over.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:19.520
Now you can go cut this stuff out and it won't be weird, right?

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.520
Oh, sure.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.520
Okay.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.520
So here's my question.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:29.700
You said you'd feel uncomfortable leading a group of men in some sort of a technology

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.700
class or something like that, right?

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.700
No, not leading.

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:32.700
Okay, teaching.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:33.700
Holding back.

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:34.700
Holding back is what she said.

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:35.700
Yeah, holding...

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.340
Like, yeah, I feel like I...

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.340
They would be ahead of you?

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:43.060
Yeah, that I'm coming in, yeah, without as much knowledge or...

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.060
Oh, okay.

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:49.420
And so I feel better about holding back a group of women because they probably, I don't

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.420
know.

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.420
Yeah, I know it's...

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.800
That's what I was getting at, that's what I was getting at.

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:56.960
So right there, don't you think that that is part of the problem?

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.960
I mean, like...

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.960
No.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:04:59.960
Okay, well, but then how can you say...

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:00.960
Here's what you're saying.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:08.120
You're saying that we need a women's group because women are being pushed aside by men

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.240
from technology, but at the same time, then you say, well, I wouldn't feel bad holding

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.680
back women because I think that they're less technically inclined.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.680
No.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.680
No, no, no, no.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.680
That's not what she said.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.680
No.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.680
You're extrapolating.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.480
I feel like the environment...

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:30.000
I think that women learn technology at a different pace than men.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.280
Possibly.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.360
I think, too, there's a difference is that those organizations recognize that a lot of

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:40.340
women are coming from a beginner position more so than some of the people that are going

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:42.640
into the more standard educational courses.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.480
So standard education is geared for people that are further along in the process where

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.040
a lot of women now are going, you know what, this is something I'm interested in, but I'm

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.840
starting at more of a square zero, and these organizations are more geared to handle that.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.720
I understand what you're saying, though, Noah.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:02.400
It is a hard position to be in to advocate for one thing, and at the same time, you're

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.400
kind of supporting...

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:08.360
Admitting or not admitting, but yeah, sort of like condoning a line of thought.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:14.720
If you're the only woman in the class, it's quite possible that the men in the room will

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:19.540
be patronizing and condescending towards you if you don't keep up with them, whereas it's

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:24.200
almost certainly the case that if you're in a room full of women, that won't happen.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.080
I guess my question, Popeye, is why do you assume that she wouldn't be able to keep up

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.080
with them?

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.080
I didn't.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.080
She did.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.080
Yeah.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.080
Okay.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.080
Okay.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:35.080
That's fair, I guess.

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:36.080
I guess it would be situational, I suppose.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:37.080
Yeah.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:42.480
So the thing is, you know, I know there are ways to advance in classes based on some tests

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:47.360
or like talking to an instructor, but a lot of the guys, I think, that are going into

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:52.280
beginning technology classes have a lot of the knowledge, and I don't.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.280
Yeah.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:59.680
You know, maybe in advanced courses or specialized courses, that would be a different story,

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.680
you know?

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:04.520
That can be more mainstream, like once it's a specialty, but yeah.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:06.560
All right.

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.240
So Ohio Linux Fest and Segal Roundup are currently...

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:10.400
That's really long, though.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.400
When is DST?

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.400
I think it's this Sunday, right?

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.400
Yeah.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400
Don't we switch over to this Sunday?

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.400
We fall back?

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.400
That's correct.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.400
On the 2nd, yes.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.400
On the 2nd.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.400
So it always screws with LAS.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.400
That's my wife's birthday.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.400
It always...

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.400
So Matt, prepare your brain for that.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.400
All right.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.400
Because that always...

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.400
You know, LAS always takes that one because it always happens on the Sunday.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.400
So I'm going to warn you guys now.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:32.400
Sunday is my wife's birthday, and she has requested a tech-free day, so I will be incommunicado.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.400
Aw, the tech-free day.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.400
Yeah.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.400
Well, just do what I do when I tell...

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.400
Oh, never mind.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.400
Okay.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.400
Go to the Jupiter Broadcasting Instagram.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.400
All right.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.400
JupiterBroadcasting.com, everybody.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:48.680
But we got some new late-minute titles coming in while I go look at the Instagram feed here.

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:49.840
You need one of those no phones.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.840
Oh, yeah.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.880
We got some.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:59.240
So there is our children in a wheelbarrow with my hair, and I think belly looks the

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.240
best.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.720
I think little belly looks the best there in the middle.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.720
Oh, my God.

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.720
That's cute.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:04.720
That's great.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:05.720
There you go.

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:06.720
They're daddy's hair.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.720
Although I think you could have got a better hair still, but that's fine.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:11.720
The hair doesn't like it.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.720
It's fine.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:13.720
That is awesome.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:14.720
That is actually really good.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:15.720
Yeah.

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:16.720
Yeah.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:17.720
Okay.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.720
So let's see where the boats.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.720
Got some last-minute suggests.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:20.720
SeaGulf.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.720
SeaGulf 2014.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.720
Linux Equality.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.720
Angela goes open source.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:26.720
Guys.

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.720
Ohio Linux and Seagull Coverage.

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.720
Digital Ocean That Makes Sense.

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:32.720
I like that one.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:33.720
Ohio Faux.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.720
Failed.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:35.720
AdrenalGland equals no energy.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.720
Thank you, Eric.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.720
You get it still.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:38.720
Thank you.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:39.720
Yes, I do.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.720
I took basic health in high school.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.720
I know.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.720
I shouldn't have opened the show with a health joke.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:44.720
I shouldn't have opened the show with a health joke.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.720
I just got this look from Angela like, what the hell are you doing?

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.720
Yeah, it was.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:09:10.720
Yeah, it was.
