00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,200
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux podcast.

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,200
My name is Chris.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,200
My name is Wes.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,040
Hello, Wes, you handsome bastard.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,360
You know, this episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru, the leader in learning for the

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,440
Cloud Linux and other modern tech skills.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,360
You know, they got them hundreds of courses and thousands of them hands-on labs.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,560
So go get certified.

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,280
Go get hired and get learning at cloudguru.com.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,800
Today on the show, we find out the latest developments in WireGuard.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,640
What the heck is going on with WireGuard?

12
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,760
Turns out a lot, and our favorite VPN just got even better.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,280
Jim Salter joins us in just a bit to chat about that.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,400
Plus we have some community news.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:53,480
We have pics, we have feedback, and even more, including one, Mr. Brent.

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Hey, Brent.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
Well, hi, Chris.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,960
You're joining me right here right now.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,160
You know what we need to do?

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
What is that?

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,240
We need to say time appropriate greetings to that virtual log.

22
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
Hello, Mumble Room.

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
Hello.

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,240
Hello.

25
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,240
Hello.

26
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,640
Hello, everybody.

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Thank you for joining us.

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,720
I don't really know how many are in there today because we are remote on the road.

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,760
So I'm not actually looking at the Mumble Room right now.

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,200
Sounds to me like a whole fluffle of them.

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
I go with a fluffle.

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,520
I could definitely go with a fluffle.

33
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,640
Yeah, I could see that.

34
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
Yeah.

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,040
So Brent and I are here in Salt Lake City right now.

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,800
We're on the road trip, you know, winding our way out to Denver.

37
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,600
We just had our first meetup in Salt Lake City, and it was great.

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,280
It was really good people.

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,720
There was all kinds, all walks there.

40
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,400
And I don't know, it just turned out even better than I think we expected.

41
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,500
I was really impressed with how many people showed up.

42
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,960
We didn't really have final numbers.

43
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
That's kind of how it goes.

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,400
But we had to keep adding tables as people walked in.

45
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
It was really great.

46
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Yeah.

47
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,540
And we had, well, we had security analysts there.

48
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,680
We had software developers, engineers, people that were just learning about Linux and were

49
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,960
curious about the Linux community.

50
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,960
I mean, it was, it was pretty nice.

51
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
It's wonderful.

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
It was.

53
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,880
And Brent in the entire time has been crammed in here with the family in Lady Joops, where

54
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,120
we are recording right now.

55
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,640
I think that's Uncle Brent to you.

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
That's right.

57
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
Yeah.

58
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Yeah.

59
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,720
Especially after you went to war in the pool recently.

60
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
I think I lost.

61
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
I'm not sure.

62
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
You always lose, Brent.

63
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,280
When it comes to that, you just pay for it later.

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
But I'm curious.

65
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
So how has it been?

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,800
I, you know, I thought maybe you were a little crazy coming along with us because there's

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,000
a, you, me, the wife, three kids and a dog in this a 37 foot RV right now.

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's true.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,760
Now looking back, I think I should have thought about it a little bit more, but I will say

70
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
so.

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Yeah.

72
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,760
Day one and two was like heavy learning curve for how to do the RV life and I kept getting

73
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,640
tips from everybody and the kids are great at saying, no, no, you got to do it this way.

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
They're experts.

75
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Yeah.

76
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
They're pros now.

77
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,160
But we're in, I don't know even which day we are, it was day five, seven, seven, six,

78
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,160
seven, something like that.

79
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
Yeah.

80
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,120
I feel like we've got this amazing routine, you know, when it's like, okay, lights are

81
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
out soon.

82
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,160
It's everybody just kind of buzzes around and nobody has any questions.

83
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,320
It's just like autopilot.

84
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,780
You've gotten some quintessential RV life.

85
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,360
You've gotten the campground experience where we've had a very, very, very loud campground.

86
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,780
You got some off-grid boondocking experiences where we're going off of battery.

87
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,160
You even had the, oh crap, we got to pull over.

88
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,760
There's a horrible windstorm situation where we were in Jerome, Idaho and the winds were

89
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,900
getting up to 25, 30 miles per hour and we just decided to pull over and spend an evening

90
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,720
in a parking lot at a Shell station.

91
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,800
I would say we made the best of that situation having those, what we grilled a bunch of tacos

92
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
and stuff.

93
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Yeah.

94
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,800
That was actually one of my favorite nights.

95
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,440
It's been pretty great because I've got Brent following behind me in the focus and so I

96
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,840
can like relay messages to Brent like, I can be like, hey there Brent, we're going to pull

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,240
over here in a couple of minutes, so keep an eye out for the next exit.

98
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,280
10-4 there Jeeps.

99
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
And that's been pretty great.

100
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,360
So we got the two-way radios.

101
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,000
And so we were in Idaho and I had to radio Brent, I had to say, I think we're going to

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,440
pull over, we're going to fuel up and we're going to check the weather because things

103
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,840
are getting pretty bad.

104
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,200
And we parked for a bit and we just couldn't get any information.

105
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,800
We just couldn't figure out what was going on.

106
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,260
Idaho kind of has like stuff spread out all over different web pages.

107
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:26,360
So eventually I was relieved when we found the ultimate Idaho resource.

108
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,000
It turns out there's a Drive Idaho podcast that is done by the transportation of Idaho

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,160
and it's all about Idaho's roads.

110
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,280
Hello and welcome back to the Drive Idaho podcast.

111
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,440
I am your host, Vincent from Bully.

112
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,400
I am the Chief Communication Officer for the Idaho Transportation Department and the Idaho

113
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,880
Transportation Board.

114
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,360
It is my pleasure to host these podcasts now for three years.

115
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,720
In season three, this is episode number seven, Boy How Time Flies.

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,000
Three years of the Idaho Drive podcast or Drive Idaho podcast and every episode is packed

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,520
full of insightful information that really had us riveted while we were trying to figure

118
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,680
out if we could survive on the road.

119
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,040
And one of the things we've been using most recently is ultra high performance concrete,

120
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:20,600
which is very strong concrete, almost has the strength of steel.

121
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,640
And we've been using that innovation recently.

122
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Yeah.

123
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,440
So you don't want to miss that kind of stuff.

124
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,380
That was really helpful.

125
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,440
So we just didn't know what to do.

126
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,580
We couldn't get any information.

127
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,580
We didn't know what was happening.

128
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,400
We had the wind forecast and they all looked bad.

129
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,680
So we spent the night there and I think we made the right decision.

130
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,040
Yeah, it did seem like the right decision.

131
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,500
And now we know about the Drive Idaho podcast.

132
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,180
So now we've got something to listen to.

133
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,920
And then just this morning, Brent made a special JB breakfast out on the griddle because of

134
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,360
course we brought the griddle with us.

135
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,920
Got to have a griddle on board.

136
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,440
That griddle has been pretty priceless.

137
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,160
I think all of us were a little groggy this morning, so I thought I'd make a special breakfast.

138
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,620
And I think, well, how was it?

139
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,620
It was delicious.

140
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:06,400
Not only was it packed with protein, but you cooked it in the shape of the letters JB between

141
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,240
the bacon and the eggs.

142
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,320
So that made it really special.

143
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
You should post a picture.

144
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,180
It was pretty good.

145
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,120
So then this is our last show that we're recording in Salt Lake City.

146
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,820
Then we hit the road onto Denver.

147
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,640
We'll have that meetup in Denver on August 20th.

148
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
That's going to be huge.

149
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,260
We're going to have folks from Linode there.

150
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,160
They're going to be giving away hardware and prizes and gift certificates for Linode services

151
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,040
or whatever you want to call that credit, I suppose.

152
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
It's going to be huge.

153
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,560
Plus we're going to have drinks and food.

154
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,980
I heard we're going to have many of our friends there.

155
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,800
Some people from the Ubuntu desktop team, some people from elementary.

156
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,080
Obviously System76 folks are going to be there.

157
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Who else?

158
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Rumor has it.

159
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Rumor has it.

160
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,080
We are probably going to even be joined by other guests that I can't remember at the

161
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
moment.

162
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,600
That's how you keep it secret around here.

163
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,240
You tell Chris, but he won't remember.

164
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
That's very true.

165
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,000
Wes is going to be there.

166
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Alex is going to be there.

167
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,600
That's going to be protein and cheese.

168
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Yeah, absolutely.

169
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,920
So that's going to be a lot of fun too.

170
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:10,200
But let's talk about who's here right now because Cassidy and Daniel Foray from elementaryOS

171
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,120
are joining us and they have some really particularly fantastic news.

172
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,940
Guys, congratulations on elementaryOS 6's release.

173
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
That's super exciting.

174
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,940
Thank you.

175
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,940
Thank you.

176
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,940
Thanks.

177
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,200
So I feel like this has been one that we've been waiting for for a while and there's like

178
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,380
so many things we could talk about, but I think the one that I'd like to start with

179
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,740
and I don't know which one of you wants to take this, but could you just tell us a little

180
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,240
bit about the new touchpad gestures that are supported throughout the OS?

181
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,320
Yeah.

182
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:50,000
That's thanks actually to a lot of work from Jose Exposito and also from some of the work

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,580
that Purism has been doing with Lib Handy.

184
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,480
So we had some like really great community and upstream work that kind of came in at

185
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,760
the right time and we were able to take that and integrate it really well and so we have

186
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,540
gestures not just at the window manager level where we can do things like one-to-one multi-touch

187
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:16,000
gestures to get into the multitasking view or pinch to zoom or you could do push and

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,120
pull to zoom with multiple fingers, stuff like that, but we're also using Handy to get

189
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,840
gestures inside applications as well.

190
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,120
So you can do things like two fingers swipe to go back, navigate in system settings or

191
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,840
in web or in a bunch of other places throughout the OS.

192
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,280
Man, it's so smooth.

193
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
It's so slick looking.

194
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,600
I mean, I experimented with an earlier version of it, not even the final version and was

195
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,640
just so, so happy with how that all worked.

196
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,880
Cassidy, I know also this has sort of been the accumulation of a lot of the thinking

197
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,000
and work around dark theming and can you explain to us how dark theming now works in elementary

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
OS 6?

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,120
Because I'm not necessarily going to have every app that's dark, right?

200
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Yeah.

201
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,080
So we've been really careful to do an opt-in dark style.

202
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,880
So by default, you can choose it in the system and all your system maps and the default apps

203
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,000
and things like the panel and doc will switch to a dark style, but we're not going to force

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,960
a dark style on third-party apps because they might have custom styles.

205
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,120
They might be forcing a specific text color and switching the background out to dark would

206
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,540
make it unreadable.

207
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,740
So we ensure that app developers can opt into that through a really simple system API.

208
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,600
And we're also working with the free desktop community and other desktops like Gnome and

209
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,360
toolkits like GTK to ensure that that can be supported across desktops as well.

210
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,760
Like a real standard or something.

211
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Yeah.

212
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,560
It'll be a standard where, you know, theoretically a cross-platform app like Firefox or Chrome

213
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,520
could even hook into that and use the same dark style like they do on other platforms.

214
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Oh boy.

215
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,600
I hope that takes off.

216
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,840
That really seems like that's the great way to split that problem where some developers

217
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,580
are concerned that you're forcing a style onto an application so it won't look correctly.

218
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,480
But this kind of system, this sort of opt-in system, that just seems like a great way to

219
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
do it.

220
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,960
I know there's also just, there's so many things we could talk about here.

221
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,680
I love the new accent colors, the way they look and the way they affect everything from

222
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,240
like your suggested action buttons to tech selection and all of that.

223
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,840
Such a nice subtle, subtle effect.

224
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Yeah.

225
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
It looks so sharp.

226
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,360
It just really pops.

227
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,120
There's also though a couple of shifts in applications.

228
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,920
I think this is where we're seeing a big embrace by the project around Flatpaks and how Flatpak

229
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,400
security is going to work.

230
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,640
Can one of you guys talk to that a little bit?

231
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,360
Because one of the things I noticed is there's that new permissions view in system settings

232
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,800
that will show you, I think, I haven't tried this yet, but I think what it does is it kind

233
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,360
of shows you what each portal Flatpak apps have been granted.

234
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Like it's a centralized place for people to view and manage this.

235
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Yeah.

236
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,920
We really embraced Flatpak in a big way and we're trying to build like a complete story

237
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,240
around Flatpak and not just like, Oh, we're shipping a couple of Flatpak apps.

238
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,640
But like you said, with managing permissions and the entire app center publishing flow

239
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,280
is all built around Flatpak.

240
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,380
Now we provide a Flatpak runtime for developers to target.

241
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,120
And also we ship our sideload app.

242
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,880
So our sideload method for elementary OS is Flatpak apps.

243
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,760
And we tell people, you know, Hey, you can download Flatpaks from Flat Hub or from wherever

244
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,900
else, you know, people might be distributing them.

245
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,400
So we're really trying to embrace like this entire Flatpak model.

246
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Yeah.

247
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,240
I mean, this is such a great example of when you guys do something, you really go all the

248
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
way.

249
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,760
It just feels integrated and it feels like it's just completely like a complete solution

250
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,520
with that extra system setting in there.

251
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:50,400
I know that Mail has also seen a total rewrite for elementary OS 6 and there's also a new

252
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
tasks app.

253
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Yeah.

254
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,900
Online accounts is another big one that we've been looking at and there's been a lot of

255
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:05,160
work from our community upstream and evolution data server to help make it easily consumable

256
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,440
with Vala and improving the language bindings.

257
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,280
So we were able to take that work and then completely rebuild Mail around evolution data

258
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,340
server and this new tasks app.

259
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:21,260
And we completely rebuilt all our online account stuff around hooking accounts into evolution

260
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,260
data server.

261
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,080
So we've really got this great foundation now to be able to start going a lot deeper

262
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,000
into online accounts and to do that work upstream.

263
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's awesome.

264
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's great to hear.

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,300
Now, you know, you know, I got to ask, let's talk about release timeline.

266
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,040
Some people have been waiting for a long time to see this release.

267
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,240
How do you guys feel?

268
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Did you hit the mark?

269
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,320
What, did it take longer than you'd like to see or is there really no expectation here?

270
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,520
What's your thoughts on that?

271
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
It's been a long road.

272
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,720
Like, I mean, we said in our announcement blog post, like there was a whole global pandemic

273
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,840
dropped on us in the middle of development, which definitely affected the timeline a bit.

274
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,400
But you know, we've always been about when it's ready rather than a hard release date

275
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,320
and we want to make sure we're getting things right.

276
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,000
I know this cycle we had a lot of really big features like the multi-touch and like flat

277
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
pack and rewriting, not just our packaging for our own apps, but rewriting the whole

278
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,800
backend for App Center itself for how developers submit their apps.

279
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,500
So there was a lot of work that went into it that had to be done.

280
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,600
And I think given that, given all the circumstances, I think it came out at a good time.

281
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,400
It definitely seems like the features that have landed here are kind of the kind of features

282
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:39,000
that check my boxes because what I feel like I'm sort of noticing is a slow increase in

283
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,600
what I can customize throughout the distro.

284
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Yeah, absolutely.

285
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,360
There's, you know, there's always, people will always say, you know, elementary OS,

286
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
you can't change anything.

287
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,940
You can't right click on anything.

288
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,920
You can't customize your theme.

289
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,820
And you know, there's trade-offs for all of those.

290
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,080
So we've introduced a lot of these options into elementary OS in a way that's well supported

291
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,300
where, you know, users can make their operating system and their computer feel like their

292
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:07,200
own, but also we don't have to support every possible combination of settings.

293
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,580
So it's always a balance and we're definitely able to move in the direction of offering

294
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,240
more options, which is really nice.

295
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,260
Yeah, that stands out, I think, about this release.

296
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,280
You can tell that the whole team's been weighing and thinking carefully about a lot of these

297
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
things.

298
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,420
You know, clearly like the dark style, it's something that's been on a lot of folks' minds

299
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,160
for a long time, but it seems like the project didn't really want to jump into it without

300
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,480
having properly thought that through.

301
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,280
And I think that shows in the user experience.

302
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,260
Yeah, I think that's kind of something that's a theme for us is we're not always necessarily

303
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,680
the first people to do stuff, but when we build a feature, we really want to make sure

304
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,880
that we do it in a way where we can really stand behind it and believe in the direction

305
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
we took with it.

306
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,520
Man, I am so excited for you guys.

307
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,760
I know the community is really looking forward to this.

308
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
The hype was real.

309
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,240
I checked in on Reddit last night on the elementary OS, I've read it and people were piecing together,

310
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,000
reading the Twitter feeds, trying to figure out how close it might be.

311
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Yeah, that's always fun.

312
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,700
Yeah, it was good fun.

313
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,160
It's an interesting problem as a completely open source project.

314
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
Everything we do is open source.

315
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,880
We even had the copy for the website on our GitHub profile like days ahead of time, and

316
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,000
we want to be completely transparent, but also we want that hype and that excitement.

317
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,600
So it's always fun to see what people pick up on.

318
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,800
Well, congratulations again, and we'll have links in the show notes if people want to

319
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,560
go grab it and support the project.

320
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,520
I think this is a great opportunity for people to kick in and help with the future developments.

321
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,320
And then we will also have a link to this blog post that Cassidy put together that is

322
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,440
a monster post.

323
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,040
There's so many more things we didn't even get to.

324
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,880
I don't know, do you guys feel like we missed anything pretty critical that we should mention

325
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,880
on the show?

326
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,920
Because I feel like the blog post itself has got another 10, 15 things we didn't even touch

327
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
on.

328
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,160
Yeah, I mean, we could probably do a whole show if you want to do a whole show just about

329
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
the release.

330
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Yeah.

331
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,440
No, I think the other really big one is we put a lot of work into the installer and kind

332
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,920
of the first run experience.

333
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:07,180
And so we hope that that helps people that are installing for themselves, but also provides

334
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,640
a better experience if they're installing to give a computer to somebody else or help

335
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,320
us with OEMs that are distributing.

336
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,440
So I think that's a lot of work going in there to make it so that it's a lot easier for people

337
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,440
to install and get elementary OS pre-installed.

338
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Yeah, great.

339
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,720
I'm glad you mentioned that because I do remember that was a point during the beta to have people

340
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
test that.

341
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,000
And that seems like a lot of work went into that and it was a very impressive experience

342
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
when I tried it.

343
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
All right.

344
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,040
Well, thanks for coming on and telling us about the new release.

345
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Congratulations.

346
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,840
And now go get working on the next one.

347
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,840
For sure.

348
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
Thanks for having us.

349
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
Thank you.

350
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:50,080
All right, now, just a really brief deck update because, you know, it is Steam Deck time,

351
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
right?

352
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,840
Which is something that I hoped we would not be seeing.

353
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,400
It seems that Valve is working to make sure that Windows, even more recent versions of

354
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,560
Windows, will run on the deck.

355
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,920
Yeah, this is a little disappointing to us Linux diehards anyway.

356
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,440
But it's a bit trickier than it might seem because Microsoft's recent push for a more

357
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,080
secure platform means that there's that whole secure boot and TPM 2.0 requirement if you

358
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,240
want to run Windows 11 without any tricks anyway.

359
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,720
Now this does include the AMD desktop Ryzen 3000 series.

360
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,300
It's got the TPM.

361
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:30,920
That's based on the Zen 2 microarchitecture, just like the APU in the deck.

362
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,240
But the support for that TPM actually working in the way Windows wants it to requires some

363
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
BIOS support.

364
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,880
And that's something that Valve and AMD are currently thinking through.

365
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,320
Yeah, and it sounds like they've already got Windows 10 up and going on it.

366
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
Of course.

367
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,520
It's just really about getting Windows 11.

368
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,300
Is this a fatal mistake?

369
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,040
It's kind of like undercutting your platform's best chance in a way.

370
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,840
Well, I mean, how could they not though, right?

371
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,880
I mean, at the end of the day, to be pragmatic, you want people to buy the hardware, you want

372
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,480
them involved in your platform and Steam runs great on Windows.

373
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,800
So yes, I think to some extent, right, it does dilute the message.

374
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,440
But could they really have not done this?

375
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
I'm not sure.

376
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,720
Yeah, and I guess it's another feature in that box, right in that checkbox, you know,

377
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,040
it says, hey, I've got, you know, Windows support when you're looking at all the features

378
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,000
of the various competitors, I suppose it's a feature.

379
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,200
Is all your favorite proprietary software?

380
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,260
I think that was the downfall of the Steam machines and not complete downfall.

381
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,140
But I think it contributed to the failure of the Steam machines is that people could

382
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,160
buy them for cheap and then throw Windows on them.

383
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,920
And it just didn't move the needle for Linux gaming.

384
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,880
So it didn't encourage developers to port native games.

385
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,600
And now here we are in a world of Proton.

386
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,400
The other thing I'm curious about is how it's going to run on the system.

387
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,160
You know, if you throw Windows on there, is it all of a sudden going to bog it down in

388
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
some way?

389
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,480
That's not the experience they expect.

390
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,820
It also seems like this time around, they've switched where the effort is right before

391
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,880
they were trying to build a platform on Linux, which required buy-in.

392
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,520
And now they're just they're bypassing that, right?

393
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
They're not.

394
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,240
I mean, yes, they want developers to better support Proton.

395
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,280
But it seems like some extent they've acknowledged like, well, we're just gonna have to do it.

396
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,720
If we want Proton, if we want to run on Linux, we're going to do the work to make it work.

397
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Yeah.

398
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:09,260
Well, we can probably guess why Valve rebased Steam OS on Arch from Debian.

399
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,740
But maybe we don't have to guess.

400
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,640
We don't have to guess any longer.

401
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
Isn't that nice?

402
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:18,440
A gamer, one of the lucky few, I know, not us somehow, who recently went to the Valve

403
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
HQ.

404
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,360
Well, there spoke to a Valve designer, Lawrence Yang, who noted, so Arch Linux, one of the

405
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,360
main reasons, and there's a couple.

406
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,560
But the main reason is the rolling updates of Arch allows us to have more rapid development

407
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
for Steam OS 3.0.

408
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,040
We were making a bunch of updates and changes to specifically make sure that things work

409
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,360
well for the deck, and Arch just ended up being a better choice.

410
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,440
Linode.com slash unplugged.

411
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,080
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account.

412
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,280
And of course, you go there to support the show.

413
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,160
Linode is where we host everything now, and they've really been focused on making it the

414
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,400
absolute best Linux experience in the cloud for 18 years.

415
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,920
They're independently owned, and that's what they have been doing.

416
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,320
That means things are fast, like the rigs, the networking, the dashboard, even the customer

417
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
support.

418
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,740
Linode really has the best human customer support, and you can get them by phone, ticket,

419
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,520
or even on social media.

420
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,120
Our most recent Linode deployment has got to be probably our colony tracking server

421
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,360
that we're using for this road trip.

422
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,600
I have a client that runs on my phone, and that pings own tracks running on Linode every

423
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,240
time the phone detects a certain amount of movement.

424
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,320
And then own tracks renders out an embeddable web view, and we are displaying that over

425
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,760
at colonytracker.live, all running on top of Linode.

426
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,480
The entire stack, heck, pretty much the entire business is running on Linode while we're

427
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,480
on the road.

428
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,080
I had to offload a bunch of stuff into the cloud from my local server, even what I've

429
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,560
relied on for years, just because I was having stability issues.

430
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,200
You can build from their marketplace as well, like with one click deployments and get going

431
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,800
really quick.

432
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,440
That's nice, but you can also DIY if that's how you prefer.

433
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,160
You can also create your own images, and then they even have community scripts, stack scripts,

434
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,120
that sometimes even have multiple distributions you can choose from.

435
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,520
There's a lot of options.

436
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,600
So that's why I think the $100 is great, because you can go over there and really experience

437
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
it.

438
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,240
Get that visceral Linode experience, if you will, DIY it up if you like, or deploy from

439
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
the marketplace.

440
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,240
They've got 11 data centers around the world you can choose from.

441
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,600
So that $100 means when you go over there, you're really going to kick the tires, but

442
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,200
you got to go to linode.com slash unplugged.

443
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,520
That's how you support the show, and that's how you get the $100 in credit.

444
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Try it out.

445
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Experiment with something.

446
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,960
That's how I got started, and that's how I got hooked, and I didn't even have $100 credit.

447
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,280
I tell you what, I did it on my own dime, and I stuck with it, and I love it absolutely.

448
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,960
I can enthusiastically recommend them to you.

449
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,680
I have no doubt you'll find something to do over there to deploy, to test, and even to

450
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
enjoy.

451
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,040
So go try it for yourself and support independent content like this here program, and get $100

452
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,000
in credit for yourself for 60 days on a new account.

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,880
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

454
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,520
Well with you on the road, Chris, we've really been putting our WireGuard setup to the test.

455
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,000
I mean, this weekend we were recording LAN and having no ends of trouble with our usual

456
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,720
tools establishing a good connection that we could actually record over, but always

457
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,080
the first thing we try is WireGuarding back to the studio.

458
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,640
Yeah, it's like this, maybe it's a carrier problem troubleshooting step, and it actually

459
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,160
works sometimes as we just kind of bypass filtering and use WireGuard, and I'm using

460
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,560
it right now to pull up the mixer and control the mixer in the studio for the remote production

461
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,240
that we're doing, because it all streams through the studio even when we're not there, and

462
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,800
the way we connect back to that to do that is over WireGuard.

463
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,960
So to say it's mission critical would be an understatement, and there's been some updates

464
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,320
recently, and something that Wes and I have been kicking around digging into is, is there

465
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,480
an improvement in the state of management tools, because WireGuard itself is kind of

466
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,600
a lower level technology, right?

467
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,440
It's an enabler, but you need kind of some user space applications on top of that to

468
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
manage it.

469
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
Well, yeah, right?

470
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,400
I mean, what happens when you dump water all over your computer and then you need a new

471
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,680
WireGuard key given to you, right?

472
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,560
Too soon, dude, too soon.

473
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,040
And as you say there, WireGuard is great, but you kind of just get some command line

474
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
tools.

475
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,040
There's like wg-quick for the command line, you can do systemd services, but you still

476
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,040
got to manage all the peers and stuff yourself, you might be running scripts, you might forget

477
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,240
exactly what you need to do if you don't use it all the time.

478
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,440
And we were kind of early on the WireGuard thing, right?

479
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,600
We were compiling the module, we were using it before, you probably should have used it

480
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
in production.

481
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,200
But that meant there wasn't really a rich set of tooling ready to go to help us kind

482
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,440
of do the next level of admin stuff for everyone that might need access to the JB Studio or

483
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,760
just for our own personal stuff.

484
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,760
That's changed though.

485
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,720
I mean, wow, I was kind of just trying to do a little mini review of what are the available

486
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
things?

487
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
What's still being maintained?

488
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,040
Because, you know, things pop up all the time, but they might be maintained for a year and

489
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,240
then people move on to other tools.

490
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,080
There are so many options now.

491
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,620
Yeah, I actually wasn't even sure like what would be the right fit for us.

492
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,600
Because like the web based stuff seems too much.

493
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,400
But the command line based stuff seemed like it was too little.

494
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:16,720
But I noticed that you found like, one, two, three, four different command line apps for

495
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,220
managing WireGuard users and keys.

496
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,280
Do you even feel like it's that necessary?

497
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,960
I guess it's necessary if only one person on the team knows how to use the core tools

498
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,240
and then you want other people to have the capability of managing it.

499
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,840
Maybe that's where it becomes necessary.

500
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,160
That's just it, right?

501
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,200
We've kind of come a bit farther from everyone having to read the Arch Wiki article on how

502
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
to use WireGuard.

503
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,980
I'll get it configured and understand like what the configuration files are.

504
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,440
Now we've got clients for our phone, you've got QR codes you can scan, you know, that's

505
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,720
the next level of user for WireGuard.

506
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,340
And yeah, if you do have a setup where you've kind of got one person or a team of admins,

507
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,900
you might want some helpers that can, you know, give you a list of stuff that all the

508
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,300
keys that you've got.

509
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,520
And there's a huge range here.

510
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,200
Some stuff is just at the shell script, or there's a clever Perl script that uses the

511
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,800
same configuration you've got with WG Quick, but lets you add comments and metadata and

512
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,640
sort of query that as an information base in a way that you can't do with the standard

513
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,640
tools.

514
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,580
And then you've got stuff that sucks all that data inside of it itself.

515
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:19,360
So some of its YAML, there's one called WG Manage, which has a snap and all the stuff

516
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,660
stored in one YAML file.

517
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,120
So if you like that, have at it.

518
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,240
Another one I've been looking at in particular is called DSNet.

519
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,140
And that's got kind of the same idea.

520
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,000
It's all stored in a JSON blob.

521
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,280
So that's one layer of how do you want to interact with it?

522
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,440
Some of them have, you know, different styles of interfaces.

523
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,440
And then some, like DSNet, well, they don't have a full true sort of GUI to do the admin

524
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
side.

525
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,100
They do have GUIs on the reporting side.

526
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,400
It's got a sort of monitor for the actual server itself.

527
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,000
So it'll show you the WireGuard send and receive traffic if you don't have net data installed.

528
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,480
And it can make you a little handy HTML report of what all the IPs you have are, who's online

529
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
or offline.

530
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,040
And so this is more of a whole server infrastructure, not just a script.

531
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
Yeah.

532
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,960
And also like how much transfer up and down they're using with the description field in

533
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
there.

534
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,080
Now this is really cool looking.

535
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,360
So this sits on top of DSNet and it generates this information.

536
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,680
It's not part of DSNet itself.

537
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
Yeah.

538
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,880
So there's no, the monitoring is a side project by another individual, but it is, I think,

539
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,720
officially, you know, the official monitoring dashboard for DSNet.

540
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,040
So external, the HTML report, on the other hand, that's built right in.

541
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Ah, okay.

542
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
Okay.

543
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,120
So now talking about GUIs.

544
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,160
So that was, those were command line applications.

545
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:38,480
We'll have links to all of that with information in the show notes, like we do, but maybe we

546
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,480
should just quickly talk about something that we used to use that we've kind of backed off

547
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,560
on, but it's not necessarily a bad project and that's subspace.

548
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,820
Yes, subspace.

549
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,200
Just a simple WireGuard VPN server GUI, a web GUI at that.

550
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Yeah.

551
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
And it looks pretty nice.

552
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
It's kind of got what you'd expect, right?

553
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Just a nice little dashboard.

554
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,480
You can see all your devices and it's got a little handy helper form.

555
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,500
If you want to go add a new device, it can show you QR codes.

556
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,280
We were excited about this because it kind of came out early.

557
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,040
It was one of the first like really full featured and there was a service packing and they'd

558
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,720
sort of put the stuff that they used for their own internal paid service out in the open

559
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,200
source world, which is awesome.

560
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,680
Unfortunately, it hasn't really been touched since then.

561
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,080
And that was kind of the problem we ran into is it had a lot of good ideas, but not everything

562
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,080
was fully fleshed out.

563
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,920
And I'm not sure if that was just, you know, it had been a code dump over the wall or they

564
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,000
were still working on that internally, but in any case, it meant it was just sort of

565
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,320
half finished.

566
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,520
And there's downsides when you go with some of these more complicated systems is all the

567
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,760
data lives in its own custom config.

568
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,340
And that meant if there were problems with subspace, like we've been doing a bunch of

569
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,640
updates on our scheduling arch based server, and at one point there were some issues with

570
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,240
mismatch versions from what the subspace container was built on and what the host was using.

571
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,040
And that meant I had to go muck around with all the internals and it wasn't as easy.

572
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,960
I would have liked to just be able to like pull all the keys out or add a new key by

573
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,320
hand on the command line if the GUI wasn't operational.

574
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,720
Yeah, maybe not as big of an issue on an LTS version of Linux.

575
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,040
Yeah, that may have been better, but I don't know that that's really how we want to operate

576
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
our server necessarily.

577
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,600
I think we like moving ahead and that would have felt like a workaround to this project

578
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,160
not really keeping up with the state of WireGuard and the kernel as well, I think.

579
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,040
We wanted something that was a current base.

580
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,160
Yeah, exactly.

581
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,480
Now in a development I had missed out on, there is now an actively maintained community

582
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
fork.

583
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,560
It's in the subspace community named GitHub Organization, which is pretty fitting.

584
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,600
And it looks like they're just carrying on development.

585
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,040
So maybe, maybe one option I didn't expect for us to have is to just try switching to

586
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,760
that and see if we like it.

587
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
Hmm.

588
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
Okay.

589
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
That's really interesting.

590
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
I definitely have to read up on that after the show.

591
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,120
There was other GUIs you found and this all gets kind of confusing because the names are

592
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
not great.

593
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,240
Like what I liked about subspace is that's a name that that sticks in my head.

594
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,500
It makes me think of Star Trek.

595
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
That's not going anywhere.

596
00:28:51,500 --> 00:29:01,360
But then we've got projects are named like WGUI and WireGuard UI and WGEasy and it just

597
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,840
kind of all blurs together and they're all separate GUIs all kind of trying to accomplish

598
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
the same thing.

599
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,520
Did one of these stand out to you over the others?

600
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,000
Yeah, it's tough because there's a lot of good options.

601
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,040
And while I've played with it with most of these, I haven't used any of them really in

602
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
anger, right?

603
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,920
We haven't even actually decided what we're going to switch to if we do switch our solution.

604
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,080
I'm tempted by DSNet so far if we don't go the GUI path.

605
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,920
Both WGUI and WireGuard-UI seems like they offer a lot of the same functionality and

606
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,820
pretty much all of these have Docker containers available and several of them are just a single

607
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,080
go binaries you can run.

608
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,760
So the setup should be easy, kind of just pops up a UI and just needs WireGuard installed

609
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
on your host system.

610
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,700
So to some extent, it might depend on what admin actions you actually do and how well

611
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,560
that's supported by that particular container and if you like the way that the GUI looks.

612
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,800
That said, there was one that stood out which is called Drago, a flexible configuration

613
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,360
manager for WireGuard networks.

614
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,480
And this has basically, it's trying to take things to the next level.

615
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,640
It can show you the network topology.

616
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,960
It can have overlay spanning networks, kind of approaching some of the ideas that we've

617
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,840
talked about in Nebula, but it can do a whole lot more.

618
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,480
It's got a rest API, automatic IP assignment.

619
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,580
It's also a single binary lightweight and it's really meant to set up encrypted node

620
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,200
to node communication.

621
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,080
And that's where there's a whole other category of like advanced WireGuard tooling that didn't

622
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,480
really exist before as well.

623
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,800
Ooh, I love the way this displays the nodes that are connected to each other.

624
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,960
We'll have a link in the show note where they have an animation that shows you the way they

625
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,500
can visualize the network topology.

626
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,800
That right there is so cool.

627
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,920
But the overall UI does seem clean, seems really straightforward.

628
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,400
And the fact that it's a single binary means it's going to be really simple to get up and

629
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,400
get going.

630
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,900
So that's Drago, D-R-A-G-O.

631
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,820
And I agree, Wes, that does look really compelling.

632
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,320
The only other direction I might suggest people consider going, and I think you might agree,

633
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,640
if you've already got Home Assistant, there is actually a Home Assistant community add

634
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,300
on to turn your Home Assistant box into a WireGuard machine.

635
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,560
And it's essentially just using a container with WireGuard in it to do that.

636
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Yeah.

637
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
I mean, why not?

638
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,800
If you're already invested in Home Assistant, if you're not doing the kind of throughput

639
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,280
where you might want to have this on its own dedicated box somewhere on your LAN, you

640
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,560
just want an easy backdoor to some of your home stuff that might want to be trying to

641
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,640
get it back door to your Home Assistant box anyway, this could be a really easy fit.

642
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,920
Although I've got to say, I have not tried this one.

643
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,360
No, no, I haven't either because I like to have it separated out.

644
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,160
But I could see some folks that might want to just sort of combine everything right there

645
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,240
and just have it all managed within the Home Assistant UI, which makes it pretty simple

646
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,400
to add and remove the stuff.

647
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,800
So I could see that.

648
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,120
You've also found some more advanced options out there.

649
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,680
Boy, we got a ton of resources for the show notes on this one.

650
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,440
Seems like there's almost too many options.

651
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,440
Things have really exploded.

652
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Yeah.

653
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,560
So we've got that company tail scale, which has a sort of mesh wire guard proprietary

654
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
offering.

655
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,000
Well, they've got some of their stuff open source and someone's written head scale, which

656
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,440
is basically a self hosted implementation of their backend control server.

657
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,440
And then there's a whole bunch of different takes on sort of wire guard mesh networks

658
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,560
at different maturity levels, including stuff for Kubernetes, or there's an interesting

659
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,120
project called auto wire, which integrates with console as a backend and sort of auto

660
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,040
magically give you a wire guard network.

661
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,040
There's also stuff to integrate with OAuth 2 or even a little tiny rust tool wire guard

662
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:29,760
dash P2P, which uses a distributed hash table sort of bit torrent style to help you set

663
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,000
up peer to peer connections over wire guard.

664
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
That's awesome.

665
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Okay.

666
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
All right.

667
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,480
Now, I want to make a call out here while we're still talking VPN stuff, because we

668
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,180
don't get to do this too often on the show, and we love to geek out about VPNs.

669
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:49,720
If anybody out there is actively using Nebula in production, that's a VPN technology, a

670
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
peer to peer network technology we've talked about before.

671
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,040
If anyone out there is using Nebula, we'd love to hear just a little bit about your

672
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
setup.

673
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,760
You don't got to give away the secrets, but just tell us how it's working for you and

674
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,600
how you're using it because we want to do a future episode on Nebula again.

675
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,720
So go to linuxunplug.com slash contact and check out the links at linuxunplug.com slash

676
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:14,120
418 for links to everything that Wes found and all kinds of additional resources.

677
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,080
And if you're struggling to just sort of put all this together, I want to mention that

678
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,360
our friends over at Cloud Guru have an LPIC-2 Linux engineer exam prep.

679
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,640
Now, this is a course that's designed to cover all the objectives for the LPIC-2-201 exam.

680
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,960
And this is going to give you a lot of good information, a lot of fundamentals, including

681
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,440
how to do capacity planning, utilities and concepts that you should know and use for

682
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
that.

683
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,260
And when you've completed the course, you're going to be ready to pass the LPIC-2-201 exam.

684
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
And that's pretty great too.

685
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,080
It helps you get certified and helps you understand some of these fundamentals.

686
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,760
We'll have a link to that or you can go to acloudguru.com for that kind of stuff.

687
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,340
Now, we did get a chance to chat with Jim Salter.

688
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,720
You guys probably remember Jim, he used to do TechSnap with Wes.

689
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,280
And now he is on two and a half admins with Alan and Joe.

690
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,000
He also writes for Ars Technica and he's been covering WireGuard for a long time.

691
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,680
And so when some new features in WireGuard landed, we thought he'd probably be the guy

692
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,420
to call up and get the scoop because he usually does a deep dive.

693
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:19,640
But one of the big things announced recently is a massive improvement for WireGuard on

694
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,040
Windows.

695
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,120
My recollection, Jim, was that they had a user space Go version of WireGuard, but this

696
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,600
is something totally different.

697
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
Yeah, exactly.

698
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,360
So, you know, since the earliest days, there have basically been two major implementations

699
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:39,720
of WireGuard, the Linux in kernel and a user space that was written in Go, Google's user

700
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,440
space programming language.

701
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,700
And the Go version was kind of the portable one that, you know, would get run on other

702
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:49,560
non Linux operating systems, or you could run it on Linux if, you know, for some reason

703
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,480
you wanted nothing to do with kernel module.

704
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
Client of last resort.

705
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Exactly.

706
00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:00,680
So like WireGuard Go is what you'll be using on FreeBSD or Macs or, you know, Windows up

707
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,840
until now and most likely still now, but you have the option of instead using a proper

708
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,440
in kernel implementation called WireGuard NT.

709
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,720
And so I guess the big difference here would be that running it in the kernel is going

710
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,920
to mean what?

711
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
Better performance?

712
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,720
Is it going to mean better stability?

713
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,640
What are Windows users going to see as an improvement as switching from user space?

714
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
Stability?

715
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
No.

716
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,340
The big things that you get are improved performance, and this isn't really confirmed like the extent

717
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:33,620
of it, but just intuitively, you absolutely should be seeing lower battery usage as well

718
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,320
on portable devices.

719
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,440
Because what you're doing by moving the implementation in kernel is you're getting rid of all this

720
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,280
context switching from user space to kernel space and back again.

721
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,240
Normally when you're interacting with your network stack, by the time you say, you know,

722
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,820
hey, I want to get all this data off this box and packets, everything goes into the

723
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,200
kernel and it stays there.

724
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,000
Like your whole network stack is in kernel from that point.

725
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,380
So you just have the one transition.

726
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:02,340
But when you're doing a user space VPN, whether it's WireGuard or whether it's open VPN or,

727
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,240
you know, what have you, what you end up having to do is kind of pop in and out of

728
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,920
kernel space, right?

729
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,160
Because you've got some kind of a virtual network driver shim basically that just kind

730
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,400
of serves to dump things onto the kernel side of it, but doesn't do a whole lot itself.

731
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,320
And then you've got, you know, all the processing, whether it's the, you know, the crypto, you

732
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
know, you have it.

733
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,300
The majority of that happens in user space.

734
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:30,060
Now that context switching, when you go from user space to kernel space and back again,

735
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,000
that introduces additional latency.

736
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,640
Now on the lower end, that's not going to be a big deal performance wise.

737
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,720
Like you know, if you're only talking about a few hundred, you know, even even a gigabit

738
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,480
on like most x86 systems, you're not really going to see a big bottleneck there.

739
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,640
But when you start talking about the higher end, when you've got, you know, 10 gigabit

740
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,780
or larger network interfaces, and you know, boxes with enough CPU to at least in theory

741
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,680
be able to manage that, now you start talking about a really big difference performance

742
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,680
wise.

743
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,160
Well, we know how you love getting nitty gritty details there, Jim, I assume you whipped out

744
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,640
some tools and did some performance benchmarking here?

745
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,200
Well, yes and no.

746
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:11,560
I did do some performance benchmarking, but I didn't try to test the 10 gig stuff.

747
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,920
WireGuard creator Jason Donenfeld had some handy dandy screenshots to go.

748
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,080
He was using Ether, which is a Microsoft offered tool pretty similar to Iperf 3, at least in

749
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,240
the way he was using it, you know, to test sequential throughput.

750
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,920
And he showed between two what used to be packet.net C3 small instances with 10 gig

751
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
interfaces.

752
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,680
And the WireGuard throughput went from two gigs flat using the old WireGuard Go and Winton

753
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,040
approach.

754
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,480
And when he dropped in WireGuard NT with the same instances, you know, the same everything

755
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,040
else, it went from two gigs flat to 7.5.

756
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
Whoa.

757
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,560
All right.

758
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,560
So this I think we should probably stress because you did kind of touch on it.

759
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,000
But this is still experimental right now for Windows users.

760
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,680
Like it involves tweaking the registry.

761
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,760
It's not quite ready for production, correct?

762
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
Yeah, yeah.

763
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,920
This is absolutely not ready for like real production yet.

764
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,680
I mean, now, if you're somebody who's just got like a couple or three machines you want

765
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:13,560
to keep connected and you know, you're like, oh, hey, well, if it if it looks good, then,

766
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,000
you know, I'm ready to try it and see how it goes, then yeah, I think it's ready for

767
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,600
you to jump in with both feet.

768
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:24,960
But if you're talking like, well, I've got a network that like a bunch of people's productivity

769
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,600
depends on this.

770
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,280
Or if you know, even if it's a case of like, well, there's only two machines, but if this

771
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,440
tunnel goes down between them, then like, you know, I'm gonna have to drive 50 miles

772
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,600
to get things fixed again, then no, this is absolutely not for you.

773
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,380
It's I mean, it's not even beta yet.

774
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,560
This is alpha code at this point, which what that actually means is that, you know, the

775
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,400
the features are pretty much all complete.

776
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,960
But it's had very little testing, right?

777
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,000
It's all about that next level of is it really robust?

778
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,200
Is this going to work in real production scenarios?

779
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,200
Exactly.

780
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,400
And, you know, as long as we're talking about, you know, the reasons that you might not want

781
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:03,000
to use this someplace where you can't afford to monkey with it yet, although I, I did some

782
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,240
testing of it, and I have not seen personally any issues with it.

783
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,920
And you know, I have seen these tunnels with, you know, many terabytes thrown down the pipe

784
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,680
and no issues.

785
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,160
The other big difference, because everything has been moved in kernel is that, you know,

786
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,400
if you do hit a major bug, the consequence is not like my tunnel went down.

787
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,600
It's my Windows box just blue screened, potentially, right?

788
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
It's a crash.

789
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Sure.

790
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,540
So with that in mind, these things are hard to judge.

791
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:34,120
But for you personally, when do you think you would start deploying this thing for clients?

792
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,160
How long is it before Jim Salter is going to advise clients use this over an existing

793
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,960
VPN on Windows?

794
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,840
In the absence of an overwhelming problem that one of those clients, you know, is reporting

795
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,520
to me, I'm not going to be using it in production to support clients until Donenfeld says this

796
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,920
is production ready, which I would guess now this is do not take this as like, you know,

797
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,200
over informed.

798
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,840
Like I got the scoop from the guy.

799
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,360
This is literally just a guess.

800
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,560
But I'm guessing, you know, somewhere along the lines of like a year from now, probably.

801
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,560
Okay.

802
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,160
And have you when you were doing research for this, have you gotten any sense if Microsoft

803
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,680
is hip to this, what their sense of this is?

804
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,040
If Donenfeld is maybe going to see somebody from Microsoft reach out, you got any idea

805
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,520
what their reaction is to wire guard landing in the kernel?

806
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,520
Let's put it this way.

807
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,840
People eat my hat, your hat and the nearest MAGA hat available if they are not both aware

808
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
and interested.

809
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,840
Okay.

810
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,360
It seems like they should be, right?

811
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,920
Well, so here's the thing.

812
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,640
I know they were absolutely paying attention when Donenfeld created Winton, which was,

813
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,960
you know, the virtual Nick that lived in user space prior to this.

814
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Okay.

815
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,440
He created that because he originally planned to use, you know, Microsoft built in VPN adapter

816
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:52,000
technology and rapidly discovered that it really was neither modern enough nor suitable

817
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
for his tastes.

818
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,960
And he already knew that, you know, he wanted absolutely no part of tap windows, which is

819
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,160
the virtual network adapter that open VPN uses.

820
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,600
So he created Winton, which is as simple as possible.

821
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,600
It's a project that's actually, it's a separate project from wire guard itself.

822
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:14,440
Winton is that lives for no other reason than to be as basic and, you know, broadly applicable

823
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
as possible.

824
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,600
A nice little primitive for doing this on windows.

825
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,920
Yeah, this, this little primitive network shim that you can hook other things to.

826
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,040
And that project already was successful enough that you actually have the option of using

827
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,760
Winton rather than tap windows on open VPN now.

828
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,240
And an awful lot of people have done a lot of testing that demonstrates open VPN throughput

829
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,160
going up about a hundred percent when you shift from tap windows to Winton.

830
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,640
And again, that's before you even get into the new stuff we're talking about with, with

831
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
WireGuard NT.

832
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
That's just wild.

833
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,640
Yeah, it's pretty bonkers.

834
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,120
So you asked earlier, you know, had I done any testing and I said, I hadn't tested the

835
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,760
10 gigabit stuff, but we never quite got into what I actually did test.

836
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,080
There was a nice little unexpected surprise that came about when Dun & Phil first started

837
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,840
letting a few people test WireGuard NT.

838
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,080
What they discovered, and this was not something that he had particularly expected or planned

839
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:10,800
on, but some of these early testers reported, Oh, Hey, this resolves my WireGuard over

840
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,920
wifi issues.

841
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,120
And these weren't specifically WireGuard over wifi, but basically any VPN over wifi, you

842
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:23,640
tend to get considerably worse performance over the VPN tunnel than you would moving

843
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,200
the same data without the tunnel over the same wifi connection.

844
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:34,120
And with the shift from WireGuard Go and Winton to WireGuard NT, some of his testers saw

845
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:37,320
throughput increases of as much as double.

846
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,040
So that was the thing that I tested because I thought, you know, that's going to be the

847
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:45,480
biggest deal to like the most people who hear about this news, you know, outside like the

848
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,480
corporate segment.

849
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,480
Right.

850
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,560
You're not a big network engineer, but you might be using a VPN on your home network

851
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,720
while you're trying to get stuff done.

852
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,720
Right.

853
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,960
Like who isn't using a VPN over wifi?

854
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,320
Yeah, I hope.

855
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,520
One of these days in theory, people will, you know, go to those, you remember those

856
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,320
old school businesses that would they call them a hotels, I think, Oh yeah.

857
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,360
You could like rent a place to lay your body for several hours.

858
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,360
Yeah.

859
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,360
Yeah.

860
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,960
And they would offer you, you know, very dodgy wifi that you didn't necessarily trust a whole

861
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,960
lot.

862
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,960
So you establish a VPN across it.

863
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,720
Well, anyway, I wasn't able to see those like super dramatic results of, you know,

864
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,520
people saying, Oh, well, you know, my, my WireGuard throughput went from 50 megabits

865
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,080
to, you know, like 200 or whatever.

866
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:32,480
But with that said, I was able to confirm throughput increases of up to like 25%, which

867
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,320
is not anything to sneer at.

868
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,560
No, I'll take it.

869
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,560
Yeah.

870
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,560
So the, now this is not proven, but the most reasonable theory that I've heard anybody

871
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,940
talking about, including Donenfeld about, you know, why the wifi performance increases

872
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:54,560
with WireGuard NT over WireGuard Go is a packet aggregation, like specifically 802.11 packet

873
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,560
aggregation.

874
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:01,760
Now, if you feed your 802.11 device driver enough data at once, basically it kind of

875
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,920
aggregates all that stuff out into a single burst that it can send out at one time with

876
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,160
lower overhead and you know, less issues with like window scaling, you know, all this kind

877
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
of crap.

878
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,840
It's, it's just better, right?

879
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:19,140
So the most likely thing that we can come up with is that what's happening is by keeping

880
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,100
everything in kernel rather than doing all this constant context switching back and forth

881
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:28,440
from user space to kernel space, what's happening is these packets are arriving in a timely

882
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,440
enough fashion to the 802.11 stack that it can aggregate them all the same way that it

883
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,920
would without the tunnel in the first place.

884
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,520
Now the other thing about that is that means you're not just seeing a throughput increase

885
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,520
on your own personal WireGuard tunnel.

886
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,800
You would also be consuming less airtime to move the same amount of data, which means

887
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,080
the wifi quality gets better for everything on that network, not just you and that one

888
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,080
specific tunnel.

889
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,400
Be a good neighbor, run your WireGuard in the kernel.

890
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,400
Come on folks.

891
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,600
Forget the neighbor, man.

892
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:02,680
I mean, who's only truly stop and think about it, who only has a single device active on

893
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,160
their own wifi in their home these days?

894
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,160
I have a wish.

895
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,160
It's not me.

896
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,160
I'm sure it's not you.

897
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,960
Chris, you only got one device over there on wifi?

898
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,720
Afraid not.

899
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,920
Not even in the RV, am I right?

900
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,280
No, I think on average we have like 36 wifi devices in the RV.

901
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,280
Exactly.

902
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,640
So if you're moving data over a WireGuard tunnel over wifi, you're not just improving

903
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,020
your experience on that device.

904
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:30,120
When you shift to WireGuard NT and get more packet aggregation, you're improving your

905
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,960
wifi for those 29 other devices as well.

906
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,440
Well, while we're talking about complicated networks here, Jim, I'm curious, you know,

907
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,040
we mentioned open VPN here and it's kind of the elephant in the room, especially for,

908
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,520
you know, bigger deployments.

909
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,060
People have been using it for a long time, have come up with ways of managing these deployments.

910
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,600
And when WireGuard first hit the scene, I remember you and I talking about this promising

911
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,260
technology, really nice, simple, clean, but I think having administration capabilities

912
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:58,640
for it, actually managing all those connections was a bit of a to be figured out issue.

913
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,120
And I'm wondering if you're using WireGuard in production with your clients, how are you

914
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,120
actually managing it?

915
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,700
Oh, God, yeah, I've long since replaced.

916
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,720
So I used to have a fairly large monitoring network that, you know, all of my clients,

917
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:15,500
server VMs and, you know, hosts and whatnot were connected to.

918
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,760
So you know, we're talking like hundreds of nodes on this network, and they would all

919
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,200
connect outbound to what amounts to a hub out in the cloud.

920
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,320
And of course, if you know anything about network stuff, you know, that, you know, once

921
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,060
you've established that connection one way, it doesn't matter which direction you established

922
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,320
it, it's a two directional tunnel once it's been established.

923
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,760
So you do it that way.

924
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,200
And you can avoid having to, you know, set up, you know, NAT pinholes and like a million

925
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,200
networks, whatever.

926
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,120
But all that used to be with open VPN, and it worked.

927
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:51,800
But unfortunately, every month, I was spending somewhere around five to 10 hours, basically

928
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,520
reconnecting crash tunnels and, you know, trying to, oh, geez, don't get me wrong.

929
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,800
I mean, I had watchdog scripts, right, that would like look for problems and try to automatically

930
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,800
disconnect and reconnect and reestablish tunnels.

931
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:10,920
But open VPN had so many interesting ways of crashing tunnels, that even writing watchdog

932
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,320
scripts that would attempt to tear everything down to the bare metal and reestablish it,

933
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:18,800
I just never could get past that, like five to 10 hours worth of, you know, there would

934
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,920
be a few things here and there that I'd have to find an alternate way into and reestablish

935
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,040
those tunnels, you know, by hand, you know, screwing around with it.

936
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:31,320
Now, when I ripped all that out and replaced it with WireGuard, I went to zero hours a

937
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,320
month.

938
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,720
It's been more than a year now.

939
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:40,560
And the average is zero point zero zero zero zero zero zero hours a month reestablishing

940
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,560
collapsed tunnels now.

941
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,560
Wow.

942
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,440
And I have to imagine over the last year, VPNs have probably been more important than

943
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,720
ever for a lot of people.

944
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,720
Oh, God, yeah.

945
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,720
So.

946
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,840
So the first step for me was replacing my monitoring network with WireGuard, which

947
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,680
was a smashing success.

948
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,680
The next step, which is still underway, is, you know, all my clients who use open VPN

949
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,520
themselves, like, you know, with their Windows laptops and whatnot to get into the office

950
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,520
remotely.

951
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,520
Right.

952
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,520
Switching them over to WireGuard.

953
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,680
We're about halfway done with that yet.

954
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,000
And it has absolutely been a win.

955
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,680
And are you finding any particular tools or making that easier or not to manage?

956
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:18,480
The kind of scale that we're talking about here, there's really not a whole lot of management

957
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,280
issue in the first place, right?

958
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:27,720
You know, most of my clients are around, let's just say the sweet spot is like 20 to 50 employees.

959
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,720
Sure.

960
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,280
So the big boogeyman that everybody always wants to bring up with WireGuard versus open

961
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,600
VPN is, oh, you can't have DHCP.

962
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,040
Everything has to be statically addressed.

963
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,380
And that's true.

964
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:41,240
I've just never quite been able to figure out why I would care about that.

965
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:47,200
I mean, you still have the same basic process of like you set up credentials for a new VPN

966
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,140
user and you hand them to that user and they install them and off they go.

967
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,140
That's still the process.

968
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,360
I guess if you had like thousands of users and for some reason you wanted to not subnet

969
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,080
enough space for them all to be connected at once, that would be an issue.

970
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:07,740
But as it is, it's not that hard to just, I mean, they get an IP address along with

971
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,960
their key pair.

972
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,040
And when you revoke their key pair, you revoke that IP address as well and you can reuse

973
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,120
that for the next new user that needs it.

974
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,120
Yeah.

975
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,440
It's been so great while we're on the road to use WireGuard.

976
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:24,180
I use it every single day and I have really enjoyed your coverage over the years now of

977
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,820
it specifically over at ours.

978
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:29,000
And now you're sharing some of that on two and a half admins as well.

979
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,040
And I just feel like you've nailed the WireGuard coverage over the years, Jim.

980
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,400
So it was just great to have a chance to have you come on here and update us on this stuff.

981
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,400
So thank you for your time.

982
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,400
Thanks, Chris.

983
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,480
There's some definite housekeeping that needs to happen around here.

984
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,040
There is so much, so much.

985
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,280
Brent, I mean, you're making a mess over here.

986
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,280
I'm sorry.

987
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,280
It's my first time.

988
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:54,960
Actually, Brent, real, true, honest, no joke, Brent did our laundry for us.

989
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,000
Brent went out and did our laundry and then he brought it back to the RV and like the

990
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,120
rule breaker that he is, he line dried our RV in the campsite.

991
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,400
Of course, he's a campsite, you know, he's a camping newbie, so he didn't know that's

992
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,200
actually against the rules for whatever stupid reason they don't want you doing that.

993
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,640
But I thought it was fantastic, so Brent's actually been helping keep it quite clean.

994
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,960
But what we do want to mention is the meetup page at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

995
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,060
will have our upcoming meetups there, like the one in Denver and the feedback page.

996
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,880
That's at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

997
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,080
And then I also want to mention the telegram group where we're sharing additional pictures

998
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,520
and tidbits from the road trip, as well as just the conversation, always participating

999
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,360
in and ongoing and whatnot.

1000
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,840
It's telegram.

1001
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,840
It's a real time chat room.

1002
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,120
I don't got to explain it to you.

1003
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,120
It's not new.

1004
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,320
Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash telegram.

1005
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,320
Get up in that.

1006
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:53,120
Also the lup lug and it was getting some love, getting some love at our Salt Lake City meetup.

1007
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,380
The lup lug happens every Sunday.

1008
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,400
It doesn't matter where you are in the world.

1009
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,980
Every Sunday, the lup lug is happening and you can get in there on mumble using free

1010
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,520
software every single Sunday and hang out with like minded folks.

1011
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,200
Details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

1012
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,800
It's noon Pacific time.

1013
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,240
But you can just go to Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash calendar and you can get all

1014
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,760
of that in your local time.

1015
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,280
We do that for you.

1016
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,120
Robots do it for you, actually.

1017
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,400
Scripted robots.

1018
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,840
Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash calendar for that.

1019
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,560
Well, I think it's time for a little feedback.

1020
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:33,340
Yann writes in, having bought an iPad two years ago and returned it after three weeks

1021
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:38,560
because it was just unworkably locked down and I couldn't stand the OS, I was a bit of

1022
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,760
a surprise to hear some of your opinions about it.

1023
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:46,480
Having tried to do even basic stuff like importing a CA certificate, it's just a pain in the

1024
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,480
butt.

1025
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,720
The system is so locked down that it just doesn't make sense for any kind of tweaker

1026
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,720
to use.

1027
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,040
I've since bought a Samsung tablet and they are really good.

1028
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:00,320
In my opinion, better than the iPad with respect to both media consumption and productivity

1029
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,280
or even something like drawing, especially price wise.

1030
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,160
And also if you want to make tweaks and modifications, you can have a Linux container system running

1031
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,680
on the tablet without an issue.

1032
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,800
Something that you'll probably struggle to do on an iPad.

1033
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,280
So maybe you guys should revisit this.

1034
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,280
Thanks in advance.

1035
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,440
It really feels like one of those, it depends on your use case, man.

1036
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,200
Like if your use case is running a container on your tablet, that definitely isn't the

1037
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,200
iPad for you.

1038
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,200
Right.

1039
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,400
No, it doesn't work.

1040
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,760
If your use case is maybe something more traditional, then I think the iPad is a really, really

1041
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,300
strong contender.

1042
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,880
This conversation is really in the context of the JingPad.

1043
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,520
The fact that the JingPad is out and it's looking like a pretty nice device.

1044
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:48,320
And so the question has kind of come up on the show, is it time to reevaluate our position

1045
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,320
on tablets?

1046
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,840
Because we've kind of written off the Android tablets and everyone on the show kind of just

1047
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,200
begrudgingly went, yeah, it seems like the tablet to get right now is the iPad.

1048
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,600
I think that's what inspired that email.

1049
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:04,040
And I guess this kind of drives the point that it really kind of depends on what you're

1050
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,040
using it for.

1051
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:10,040
I still think the iPad is a better tablet device because I want something that has a

1052
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:14,680
built-in LTE connection that's pretty reasonably priced and easy to connect to my provider

1053
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,280
and has support by my carriers.

1054
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:24,120
I want something that has the X32 edit app from Behringer, which is an app in the Apple

1055
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,400
App Store, and I want something that has WireGuard support.

1056
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,440
So that way I can connect over LTE, establish a WireGuard connection, and then control my

1057
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,520
mixer with the X32 software.

1058
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:41,160
The iPad happens to nail that job, and I don't think I could get it accomplished on the Jing

1059
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,160
Pad.

1060
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,860
Maybe I could on the Samsung.

1061
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,840
And so the question is, is it time to revisit this?

1062
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,840
I think the answer is yes.

1063
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,660
You know, you look at the Jing Pad, you look at what people are saying they're doing with

1064
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,660
different tablets.

1065
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:53,560
I think, yeah, the question is, do you have the money for it?

1066
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,480
And that's really the problem is you only have so much money to spend on these kinds

1067
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,040
of things, and you don't want to blow it on something that's going to turn out to be a

1068
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,280
crap device.

1069
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,480
You want to spend that money on something you're going to get years out of.

1070
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,480
Maybe you can hand it down.

1071
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,520
I can hear the pain in your voice, like maybe you've been through this before.

1072
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,160
Yeah, I mean, that's been a lot of my kids have hand-me-down devices.

1073
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:18,200
And when you look at the years of support you get with iOS, the pretty good app store,

1074
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:23,240
and the pretty decent performance, even from older tablets, it's a pretty strong value.

1075
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,120
But there are a lot of other great devices out there, like I've recently started grabbing

1076
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,440
some Fire tablets for some of my home automation stuff.

1077
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,120
And after you spend some time with them, you can actually turn them into decent devices,

1078
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:38,560
and they're at a way, way, way, way better price point than an iPad, or probably even

1079
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,040
the Samsung tablet.

1080
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,600
But I notice that you don't travel with a tablet.

1081
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,420
You just have the laptop.

1082
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,420
Never really appealed to you?

1083
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,560
Well, I think you nailed it.

1084
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:53,360
It's the combination of dedicating a certain amount of funds to a device that kind of,

1085
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:58,180
I guess when I really tried to explore them, they felt like they got old quite quickly,

1086
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,800
and they were locked down in the ways that I didn't appreciate.

1087
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:06,360
So for me, lightness and travel, of course, is another huge thing.

1088
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,080
Yeah, they all seem so limited, right?

1089
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,060
So then you're kind of just buying an appliance.

1090
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:14,780
You almost have to accept the fact that this is a limited device, and that's why I have

1091
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,780
a PC.

1092
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,780
It's interesting.

1093
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,920
I thought the tablets would replace my need to bring a laptop everywhere, but I haven't

1094
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,360
really found any success in that.

1095
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:26,920
And every time I kind of dabble in it, maybe I need to be more creative, perhaps.

1096
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,680
And I'm welcome to some feedback there.

1097
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,520
Just carrying one machine and it's a laptop seems like it works for you.

1098
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,360
Well, I bring small things, you know.

1099
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,320
It's only a 13 inch.

1100
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,920
You did hear me complain about the fact that that screen felt a little small, and I've

1101
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:45,480
noticed some users using their iPads as extra screens, which I think that would certainly

1102
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,480
appeal.

1103
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,880
So I have become re-interested.

1104
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,800
That goes back again to your use case, like if, yeah, do you want to use it as an extended

1105
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,800
display?

1106
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,040
Well, which tablet supports that?

1107
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,520
Yeah, I noticed you only have one sticker on that laptop, though.

1108
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,520
I mean, it's a good sticker.

1109
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,560
It's a Linux Unplugged sticker.

1110
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:03,600
But did you know we have a whole new batch of stickers over at JupiterGarage.com?

1111
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:08,520
And they're all taken from the high resolution, what's it called?

1112
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,520
Why am I blanking on it?

1113
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,520
Because I'm exhausted.

1114
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,520
It's hot.

1115
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,520
And I've had a cider.

1116
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,520
Album art.

1117
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,520
Yeah, yeah.

1118
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,520
But what are we?

1119
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:16,520
Vector art.

1120
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,520
The vector, the vector art.

1121
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,520
That's what I'm trying to say.

1122
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,520
Because it's super high.

1123
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,800
We're able to just do like really beautiful stickers at three different sizes.

1124
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,280
That's what I'm trying to say, Wes.

1125
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,200
And the other thing I forgot to mention last time, which is why I put this in the show

1126
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:33,320
doc to begin with, is if you get one sticker, additional shipping on the stickers is 10

1127
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,320
cents.

1128
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,720
So you could get yourself like a self hosted Dakota Radio or Linux Action News or Chris

1129
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,080
and the Badger or Linux Flies on Mars sticker.

1130
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,480
They're all over at JupiterGarage.com and they are awesome.

1131
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,760
Our members get a discount that is in your members info feeds and stuff like that.

1132
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,600
I think that's how it works.

1133
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:58,560
You may have heard in our chat with Jim that he mentioned an application he was using to

1134
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,680
benchmark his WireGuard connection.

1135
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:04,200
And we may have, we may have talked about this, but this is a pick that's so dang good

1136
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,040
we want to talk about it twice.

1137
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:10,700
And it's called Ether, a comprehensive network measurement tool.

1138
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:16,760
And it's by this upstart developer named Microsoft.

1139
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:21,320
And they've created, this Microsoft company has created this tool that you can run on

1140
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,520
Linux, you can run it on your Windows and on your Mac.

1141
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,680
And you give it a few flags and you're off and running and you get nice, really well

1142
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:33,720
displayed information about performance information, statistics, any errors that have been noticed

1143
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,880
by the system and all of that.

1144
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,320
I don't know, did you get a chance to play with this Wes, because I think we've actually

1145
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,640
talked about it once before.

1146
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,640
Oh, we have.

1147
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,420
It was actually a pick on Linux Unplugged episode 280.

1148
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:48,720
And funny enough, that episode is when we had just gotten back from visiting System

1149
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,660
76 in Denver way back in 2018.

1150
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,160
So it feels fitting to be revisiting it now.

1151
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,160
Wow.

1152
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,940
That is, that's serendipity right there, isn't it?

1153
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,780
You can tell something's on our mind when we're on the road and solid remote connectivity

1154
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:07,840
and figuring out what route and what connection is the best is on our mind.

1155
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,840
We're solving problems.

1156
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,840
Yeah, exactly.

1157
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,840
Right.

1158
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,880
And clearly we haven't figured everything out.

1159
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,280
We're still solving the same problems.

1160
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,280
As for Ether, if you already use Iperf 3, I don't know, you probably don't need this

1161
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,280
if you're comfortable.

1162
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,520
I think the value is they've got some neat thread based scaling so you can kind of have

1163
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:28,540
a single server and use that to benchmark a whole bunch of systems and it should scale.

1164
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,360
And it's just a single little go binary.

1165
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,840
So it's easy to run, especially because it also runs on Windows and Mac OS.

1166
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,080
So if you've got all kinds of different clients you want to benchmark, maybe this is the tool

1167
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,080
for you.

1168
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,080
Hmm.

1169
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,480
Very nice link to that in the show notes.

1170
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,480
All of those links will be at Linux Unplugged dot com slash 419.

1171
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,760
Wes, am I right that the next time you and I are doing a show, it's going to be together

1172
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,760
in Denver?

1173
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,760
Oh, I'm excited.

1174
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,760
Yeah.

1175
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,440
You get in early that morning too.

1176
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,720
So I guess that means you're probably just going to have to do all the show prep on the

1177
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,880
plane, you know?

1178
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,080
So I'm just going to assume you'll do all the prep then that week.

1179
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,300
So you're going to have that flight out.

1180
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:06,960
You know, whatever they've got in the magazines, I'm sure we'll have some mention of Linux,

1181
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,960
right?

1182
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:08,960
Yeah, probably.

1183
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,960
There's probably something in there.

1184
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,560
If not, we'll just, I don't know, we'll figure it out.

1185
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,920
I'm really looking forward to it.

1186
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,920
It's going to be fun.

1187
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,280
We don't even know where we're recording yet.

1188
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:17,620
We may do it in Lady Joops.

1189
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,420
We may be able to do it at System 76.

1190
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,880
Maybe we'll do it in the Airbnb if we can get in there that early.

1191
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,880
Who knows?

1192
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,880
But it's going to be fun.

1193
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,960
And then once we're all there, we're going to have a JB Airbnb where, well, we'll see

1194
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,960
how that goes.

1195
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,360
But we're all going to be in one spot.

1196
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,080
But we'd love to have you join us live just to experience that and see where things are

1197
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,080
at.

1198
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,480
You can do that over at jblive.tv.

1199
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,720
We do it at Tuesdays at noon Pacific, 3pm Eastern.

1200
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,600
See you next week.

1201
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,040
Same bad time, same bad station.

1202
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,680
And there is a lot more going on.

1203
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:53,360
Of course, Self Hosted is going to be recorded on the road this week as well.

1204
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,360
So do your thing.

1205
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,760
Go over to the Twitter, follow the network at Jupiter Signal, get information on all

1206
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,480
of that stuff and future meetups.

1207
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,360
You can follow this here podcast at Linux Unplugged.

1208
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,360
Or if you don't do the Twitter thing, I don't blame you.

1209
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,380
You can just find everything we're doing over at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

1210
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,680
That's the main network website.

1211
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:15,280
And if you're not yet listening to Linux Action News, you're missing about 20 to 30 minutes

1212
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,520
of what the heck is going on in the world of Linux every single week.

1213
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,680
And you probably should get tuned into it.

1214
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,880
Links to everything over at LinuxUnplugged.com.

1215
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,880
Thanks so much for joining us.

1216
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:43,040
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1217
01:00:54,760 --> 01:01:10,360
I think Levi has won Brent over a little bit, you know, because Brent came in kind of a

1218
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,360
cat guy.

1219
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,360
Not that he's anti dog.

1220
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,360
I'm not trying to say that.

1221
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,400
But I feel like you came in and you just were kind of, you know, that's Levi.

1222
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,400
That's great.

1223
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,520
It's really good to see Levi again.

1224
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,520
But then Levi started snuggling with you in the morning and then pretty soon you started

1225
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:28,200
taking him on walks and the next thing you know he's spending the entire night with you.

1226
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,200
I feel like there's something developing there.

1227
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,400
Well, I think he's got this nice way of welcoming guests and he's totally won me over.

1228
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,640
That's for sure.

1229
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,640
It's pretty great to see.

1230
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,640
All right.

1231
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,640
JBtitles.com.

1232
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,640
I don't think I started the titles.

1233
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,660
I don't because I couldn't get in the IRC room.

1234
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,240
So we'll just see how that goes.

1235
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:45,880
You know, it's a road show everybody.

1236
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,880
Don't worry.

1237
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,080
We've got a few titles listed under show not listed.

1238
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,080
That seems appropriate.

1239
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:58,160
Oh man, I'm glad to be done for at least a couple of days until self-hosted because I

1240
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,120
tell you what, it has been tricky doing this on the road.

1241
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,560
The connectivity has been really weird because we're kind of close to downtown Salt Lake

1242
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:09,080
City which means sometimes the cellular networks are really kind of busy and there's a construction

1243
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,120
project going on.

1244
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,440
There has been a concert.

1245
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,600
There has been people coming and going.

1246
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:19,360
Like even just during this recording there was planes taking off, motorcycles going by,

1247
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,240
diesel trucks starting up, I mean the whole thing.

1248
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,220
It's been kind of a real juggle more so than I expected.

1249
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:29,440
So hopefully when we get out of here it's going to be in quieter territory.

1250
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,880
Salt Lake City has been very smoky so it hasn't been like the most like impressive experience

1251
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,080
but I do want to come back and enjoy it sometime.

1252
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,760
This spot isn't bad if you were here to just enjoy the city because it's right next to

1253
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,760
the rail.

1254
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,960
I mean you can walk to the rail in like five minutes and it's close to everything.

1255
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:50,440
It's ten minutes to everything downtown and lots of good eating and all that kind of stuff.

1256
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,720
So I would totally recommend this KOA in Salt Lake City if you were an RVer and you were

1257
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,840
coming here.

1258
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:00,960
But if you wanted to come here to record or work quietly it would probably look somewhere

1259
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:17,280
else.
