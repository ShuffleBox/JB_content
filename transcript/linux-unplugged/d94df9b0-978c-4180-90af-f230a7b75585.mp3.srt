00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 438, a special holiday edition.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hello friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
My name is Chris.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
My name is Wes.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And my name is Brent.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And because it is a special edition, we have a bunch of friends joining us today.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Welcome back to the show, Joe.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, sir and Drew.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
How do you do?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And of course, this is our annual predictions and review episode.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So before we go any further, before we get into those,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
let's say hello to our virtual lug.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hello, Chris.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello, everyone.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hello, you guys.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm really glad to have you here today because there's some of these

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that you're on the record for.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So it'll be good to get your takes on it.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Suckers.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, you're going to have to own up just like we will.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In fact, why don't we start with that?

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're going to start with the review, then we'll do the actual predictions

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
with just a disclaimer off the top of the show here.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm in a weird situation.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is the backup recording gear.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Like I bring, yes, I do.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I bring a backup podcasting backpack.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And like my just in case something goes wrong and I get stranded somewhere,

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can still do a show, go bag.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And that's what's been deployed for today's episode because everything

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
that happens to me seems to be really my own fault when I think about it.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I decided to go out into the woods for a white Christmas,

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
went to one of my favorite spots, got a nice white Christmas,

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and then we got inundated with one of the biggest storms we've ever had

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
in my lifetime here, especially where I'm at, you know,

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
temperatures around five degrees Fahrenheit, snow every day.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's just been a wild, wild cup.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, it's been about a week now that I've been here

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
that I've been stuck.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And now we're almost out of gas.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We're almost out of propane.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We're almost out of water.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But I wanted to get Linux unplugged done.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We wanted to get it recorded.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And then I'm going to try to get out of here because it is cold

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and the RV is frozen.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So things sound a little weird.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If there's something that doesn't seem quite right,

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
that's what's going on right there is this is the backup backpack.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And it's going to be a little hokey, but we've been testing stuff.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We've been sorting things out.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And I'm hoping that when we get done with the shows,

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
the roads will have melted enough that we can safely make it out of here.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Although I'm not actually sure we can get our slides in

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
because our slide toppers are icebergs right now.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So we'll see.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So I'm just going to focus on the show.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Just going to focus on the show.

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Although this was the week I was right now.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This was like this is like work on projects in the studio time.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And instead I'm stuck here in the woods.

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thank goodness I brought the Starlink dish with me.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, this is a really battle testing the old Starlink setup.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And so far so good, right?

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's battle testing everything.

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's the opposite of Tucson.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's bizarro Tucson where I had a problem of things overheating.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Now I have a problem of things getting too cold like my batteries.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
They can't get lower than 25 degrees Fahrenheit or else they stop taking a charge.

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So like I got to continually stress the system and keep the inverter going.

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So that way it vents heat into the battery bay.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I've had to get up every two hours for the like last six nights

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
because I got to make sure the temperatures are OK.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So while the show's going, the temperatures drop.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And then as soon as we get done doing the show, I have to like generate a big load, a big noisy load.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So that way I can warm the batteries up.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's the game I've been playing.

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well, you're up all night.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sure you've been stewing over your predictions, huh?

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And perhaps lamenting what you said last year.

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I know I have.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, boy, oh, boy.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
These aren't looking good for me, Wes.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I like your predictions a lot better than mine.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We've all got some here.

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So I say we start owning it up.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now, just to remind folks that haven't listened before,

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
we have some predictions we'll be getting to, but we have to be concise.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We have to be very specific.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And we have Joe along to play arbiter and judge to make sure that we comply with the rules.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're going to keep us in line, right, Joe?

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, I'm the referee.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You've got to be specific.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's got to be quantifiable.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We've got to be able to measure it next year.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's right.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And you have to we're going to try to get everybody to state it in a nice, concise way.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
So that way it's something that's easily reviewable and provable,

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
which is what we're going to do now.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So what do you say?

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Since Drew is our guest, we start with Drew this year.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So get yourself ready, Drew, because I don't know how many of these came true,

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
but each one of them had super sound reasoning,

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
starting with your Chrome OS prediction from last year.

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I predict in 2021 that Google will release an official ISO image for Chrome OS for x86 computers.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Drew, I checked and this didn't actually happen,

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
even though they bought that company that essentially did this.

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, no, I totally thought this was going to happen.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And then it didn't.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You can get Chromium OS.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's not technically official, but there is no Chrome OS.

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So, you know, it's like you think you see that you see all the tea leaves like kind of you're reading them

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and you see, gosh, you know, they've they've been kind of having like this kind of side x86 port that they've maintained now.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now they just bought this company when their entire focus is rebasing Chrome OS for x86 PCs.

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And then nothing, nothing, just nothing.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Is this just to tell that x86 is really on the way out?

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Maybe.

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, but why not use that same tech to make Raspberry Pi images of Chrome OS?

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Seriously.

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Be a good way to, you know, increase the user base.

124
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
People want to try it out.

125
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
All right, Drew, now this next one.

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, I feel like you were you were you were kind of recently into the new gig and looking at what was going on in the marketplace.

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And this one seemed really solid.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I predict in 2021 that Rancher ownership will change hands.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Rancher OS would be sold and it didn't happen.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Nope. Missed that one, too.

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Now, what was your thinking on that one?

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Just that SUSE tends to kind of fluctuate a lot and, you know, it's hard to go wrong with the SUSE bet.

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You know what I think happened is some new leadership came in and they recognized some of this stuff is their best product.

134
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah, absolutely.

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So leadership had a change of heart.

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And otherwise, I think you would have got it.

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Now, this one, this one you got right.

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I predict in 2021 that VMware will go independent.

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And that has happened.

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Dell has spun off VMware.

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hey, oh, completed. Done.

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Give me that point.

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You got it, sir. Nicely done.

144
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
This may be our only win.

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't know. I don't know about that.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
All right. What do you say?

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Should we do poppies?

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
How you feeling, Poppy?

149
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You ready to do some of yours?

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah. OK. All right.

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Now this one, actually, I think you're going to start out with a win from last year.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I predict in 2021 Canonical will neither IPO nor be bought by Microsoft.

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Turned out you got that one.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Did you have insider information?

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Hmm. Yeah, I might have done at the time.

156
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Not anymore.

157
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But even though not anymore, I'd be happy to keep that one running for a couple more years.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yeah. OK. All right.

159
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You'll double down.

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So and you're including the IPO in that.

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yep. OK. All right.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Well, one of our first M1 predictions was made by you.

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Here's how it went.

164
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:34,000
In 2021, Hector Martin and collaborators will get 90 percent of the hardware in the first generation M1 Max booting on Linux.

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
OK, I feel like this is the first one where we got to we got to kind of discuss it a little bit.

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And then Joe's going to have to make the final call because what do you think the GPU accounts for in that setup, Poppy?

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Like is GPU 10 percent or is it more like 20 percent?

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, I was thinking more, you know, 90 percent functionality.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I know I said 90 percent of the hardware.

170
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I felt like, you know, could you get it working the same way that you put Linux on a ThinkPad?

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It 90 percent works.

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You could probably say 90 percent like the fingerprint reader doesn't work or, you know, some small part that you don't use doesn't work.

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know. I've seen pictures of people running M1's with Debian and it looked pretty good.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yep. Using GNOME with LLVM pipe or whatever it is to do CPU accelerated graphics.

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So what do you think, Judge?

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I think until we get an installer, it doesn't count at all.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's zero percent.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Oh, no, that's unfair.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's unfair.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
If you said 90 percent, you know, ThinkPad fingerprint reader at 90 percent.

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, it's not there, right?

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
With if you're using LLVM pipe.

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, exactly. I don't think that it's it's there.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I think the problem is the final 10 percent takes 90 percent of the time.

185
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Right. True.

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah, we did just see some more patches land like two days ago to enable more of the T1 and T2 hardware.

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That looks really good.

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So, I mean, you know, I would be surprised if we're sitting here at this time next year and it's not correct.

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I got to feel like I don't know about full GPU acceleration, but just about everything else does seem there.

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I mean, some some people might be happy with just that.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I personally just want headless Linux for server purposes. So, you know, that's all I need.

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
All right, Poppy, CentOS was on our mind and you have our first CentOS prediction from last year.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Here's how it went.

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
In 2021, Red Hat will do something disliked by the community, which intentionally makes life hard for the ROX Linux developers.

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hmm. I'm thinking through and I can't think of an example of this.

196
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, I'm not really in that community and I don't keep an eye on CentOS and Rocky and all the others.

197
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So I don't really know. I thought we would have heard about it if they had. So I don't think so.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
OK. All right. Well, keep thinking on that.

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Maybe we could return to that in the prediction section of the show because it seems like there's that's pretty ripe right there.

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's got to be something going on. Why don't we stick with the Mumble Room?

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Byte, you had a prediction about risk and it went like this.

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I think in 2021, there will be a credit card sized computer with a full-fledged RISC-V CPU.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
A credit card sized computer. So you're thinking like Raspberry Pi size? Is that what you meant?

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah, around about. So, yeah, with developer boards, they could be twice the size, but yeah, more like Raspberry Pi.

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Ref slash judge, whatever I keep calling you. What do you think?

206
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I think that we have seen some that are getting towards that size. It's not very powerful. I can't remember what they're called though right now.

207
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There has been a lot of progress towards that anyway.

208
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Beagleboard test one.

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's it.

210
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, all right.

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So it's a win.

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hang on. I have that board and it's prototype, but it's not out yet.

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh, wait. Does prototype count? Does that count?

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It was limited to 300 developers, I think.

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
How do you get one then?

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Because I pretended to be a developer, but they discontinued it and they've said there will be another one, but it's not this one.

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So that's not a publicly available device.

218
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Uh oh. Do we have to retract the win?

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I think we might have to.

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Boy, that's tough. I see a lot of flutter about it, you know, last January. So it was looking good throughout the year, but I guess not.

221
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What a shame. That was a close one. That was a close one. All right, Wes Payne, prepare yourself.

222
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We're going to do your predictions. And you started with one that I really, really hoped would materialize, but I don't think it did.

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I predict that in 2021, GNOME finally fixes their plugin problem with a new API they've announced.

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That means a misbehaving plugin can no longer crash your whole dang shell.

225
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't think so, Wes.

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Nope, definitely not.

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I was hopeful. You know, there's been a lot of interesting GNOME developments this past year, that's definitely for sure.

228
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Plenty of drama and active community discussion as well, but not a lot of progress there.

229
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No, something like that would have been so great for end users and distro makers, but it seems we're still a bit out from something like that materializing.

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Now, this next one, I feel like you're going to get it right, just not necessarily yet.

231
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I predict that in 2021, the first Rust based kernel module will be widely distributed, either optionally in the main tree or shipped by Ubuntu, Fedora or Arch.

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't think that happened. No, it didn't.

233
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, a lot of progress, even just this December, the V2 of that big old patch set was set out, seems like it's now using the stable Rust, so that's getting a lot closer to shipping.

234
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
They've got support from people like ARM, Google, Microsoft, all are interested in seeing this happen.

235
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So it seems almost inevitable at this point, but yeah, maybe next year.

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yeah, and it seems like when it does happen, we're going to start probably with a device driver, right?

237
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And then it'll kind of grow from there.

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah, you know, little bits, standalone, independent functionality that, you know, get the community comfortable with it.

239
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
We'll keep our eyes out. We'll keep our eyes out.

240
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And then your last one was probably the spiciest of them all.

241
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And I think if I recall, my reaction was sort of like, what?

242
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I predict that Linus Torvalds will make an announcement sometime in 2021, and he's stepping back to some degree from his day to day involvement with the Linux kernel.

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You know, the other thing is, I don't even know if he would make a public announcement or if it was just something he would slowly ratchet down over time.

244
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Right, sort of slink away. That's a good question.

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
There definitely was an announcement, though, which I think I'm glad of, right?

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I mean, we've got a nice, a lot of nice emails out on the mailing list and plenty of RC postings, et cetera, from Linus this year.

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Well, he'd be missed.

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah, he's been, actually this year, he's been really consistent with the releases.

249
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Only a couple of delays for pretty reasonable reasons with the kernel releases.

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And he always kind of puts like a cute little note in there explaining what the reason was for the delay.

251
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And it's always just such a human reason, like, oh, man, the airport was just packed and traffic was just awful.

252
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So this one's making it out a little late. It's just something to see that, you know, it's so human.

253
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
All right. Time to own up to mine, I suppose. And then we'll get to the predicting here.

254
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We do have a couple of extra bonus ones I might slip into, but.

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Well, I am really kind of bummed to say that my first prediction, I feel like we are absolutely no closer to than when I made this prediction in 2020.

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And our manufacturer in 2021 will come out with an ARM SOC that matches or beats Apple's M1 on Geekbench.

257
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Geez, that just didn't happen at all.

258
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Unless you count the M1 Pro and Max.

259
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No, damn it. I do not. Damn it. I really was like I thought Samsung would have an ace up their sleeve like they, you know, this is their business.

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
They must have seen this coming. They just surely were just not totally caught off guard.

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Right. Like they weren't just totally flat footed.

262
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
No, they were. And they're still working on their damn response.

263
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And Qualcomm as well. And so, yeah, I couldn't I don't even know if I'd want to make this that prediction this year.

264
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Who knows? It may not even happen this year. It's pretty pathetic, actually.

265
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Apple just lapped them. Hey, at least Asahi's doing well, huh? Yeah, that's true.

266
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yeah, that is true. In fact, Apple just recently made a change to Mac OS, the latest point release that is going to make it easier for Asahi Linux long term.

267
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And and Hector Martin thinks it's a change that was made implicitly for Asahi Linux.

268
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's like one of those like sneaky little changes that makes life simpler.

269
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I have not played this next one. I wanted to save it for myself, but I do feel like there's going to be maybe some debate.

270
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It depends on how specific I got.

271
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I predict that system 76 will begin in 2021 to maintain their own genome shell packages.

272
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So I said begin to maintain. Does Cosmic count as their own genome shell packages?

273
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I think so. Yeah, you do. I'm surprised. All right. It seems like they're headed in that direction, at least.

274
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So begin. Yeah. OK, so you're going to give this one to me.

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I am. Yeah. Wow.

276
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yeah. Only because you qualified it with begin sneaky tactic there, Chris. Can I interject for a moment?

277
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So if you look in the system 76 PPA, which is where they build a lot of their stuff, there are no shell packages in there.

278
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
No, no, no. They are in there. So just to validate that they are maintaining, to some degree, some known shell packages.

279
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And I'm glad you showed up today. Here we go. Thanks. Thanks, Poppy.

280
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Good. Poppy with the science. Yeah. So I also just dropped a link in the chat above their GitHub repo for their known shell with a few patches they add on top of it.

281
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I am elated just because I had resigned myself to not having a single win here because like this last one, I can't really verify.

282
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I have found out a rough estimate since the last time Microsoft released numbers, but I made this prediction about WSL.

283
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm going to say that in 2021, it becomes public that a distribution has more users on WSL than physical installs in the wild.

284
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And this just didn't really seem to happen. From what I can tell, I saw an article quoting three million to four million active daily WSL users.

285
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But I don't actually know if that's true. And I don't know how current the numbers are.

286
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And I don't know if that surely that's larger than some distros.

287
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But no distros come out and said, we're the largest WSL distro, etc, etc. You know, it just doesn't seem like it happened.

288
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You were very specific about it. And I think that was your downfall here.

289
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You said that it would become public, first of all, so not just a leak or whatever.

290
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And also, you said that there'd be more WSL for a particular distro than there would be physical installs.

291
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So, no, I'm afraid this is an absolute fail. I think it is. I agree.

292
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's OK. I got one win, so I'm feeling pretty good going by the odds now. Our buddy Alex couldn't make it today.

293
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
He had something come up, but he did make this prediction last year and he wants to submit it again for this year.

294
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I predict slash hope that a Western Digital easy store 20 terabyte hard drive will cost two hundred and fifty dollars or less at some point in 2021.

295
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The supply chain shortages just really messed up that prediction.

296
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It may have happened if things had just continued to tick along like we expected.

297
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But we had no idea what we were in store for for supply chain issues.

298
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
No, we did not. But gosh, yeah, here's hoping that one comes true for all of us data hoarders.

299
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Right. I agree. I agree. We also, by the way, should mention we made a few predictions in Linux Action News and I have a Raspberry Pi prediction in Linux Action News for that episode.

300
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But Alex did make one regarding the Raspberry Pi.

301
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The next major release of the Raspberry Pi, maybe the Pi 5, will have an option for a proper storage system.

302
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So that's MVME or M.2 SATA or just a genuine SATA port.

303
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Negative. Pi 4 was released in 2019 and it was not updated, hence maybe my prediction in LAN.

304
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Sorry, Alex. Maybe next year.

305
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Linode dot com slash unplugged. Go there to get one hundred dollars and sixty day credit on a new account and you go there to keep this here show going.

306
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Man, I tell you what, I am so glad that I sink the essentials like clips and ISO images up to Linode.

307
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's like my go bag digitally. I have stuff up there that is just easily accessible or even better.

308
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Easy to spin up on Linode when I'm in a pinch. That's where we've built everything in the last couple of years.

309
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's really the cloud for a Linux geek. They have 11 data centers worldwide and they've been hard at work for 18 years,

310
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
creating the best experience for running applications on Linux. That's it.

311
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Nobody can just touch that kind of experience and passion.

312
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
If you like to build something yourself or deploy one of the many one click stacks, Linode has excellent options for you.

313
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Either way, you're going to get started fast, quick and easy.

314
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That matters because if you get an inspiration for an idea, you can get something up and running in just seconds on Linode.

315
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And they've been rolling out screaming fast NVMe storage.

316
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
They have AMD epic processors in their CPU rigs and they have the best customer support in the business.

317
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You add it all together, it makes a lot of sense.

318
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Customer support is great. Super fast rigs. A Linux culture that runs deep.

319
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And it's a great way to support the show, too.

320
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
There's a lot of reasons to choose Linode, but that $100 might be the biggest because you can really go try it for yourself and let me know what you think.

321
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Linode.com slash unplugged. Get $100 for 60 days on a new account and you support the show. Linode.com slash unplugged.

322
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Well, now that we've seen how we did last year, I suppose it's time to make some predictions about 2022.

323
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Gosh, I feel a bit foolish even just saying we're going to try to do that, but do what we must.

324
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yeah, especially after that go.

325
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Well, perhaps I'll give it a start here.

326
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm going to predict that Canonical announces a Flutter-based desktop environment.

327
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You madman. A whole desk like a Unity 3 kind of project that is Flutter-based?

328
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yeah, like that.

329
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Mad lad.

330
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Ref, you got any specifics you want out of this before we have them lock that one in? It seems kind of straightforward to me.

331
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Announce, not release.

332
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Announce, not release. Yeah.

333
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Aha. Good catch.

334
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah, otherwise that's all good.

335
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
All right, let's lock it in Wes.

336
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I predict that in 2022 Canonical will announce a Flutter-based desktop environment.

337
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I would be really, really excited to see that happen just because what a fun thing to follow.

338
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Don't know if it'd ever be for me, but yeah, it'd be interesting to see that.

339
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Right? Yeah.

340
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm curious about Popeye's reactions to this, whether he's smiling or rolling his eyes or, I don't know, crossing his fingers.

341
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, when we did our predictions on the Ubuntu podcast, the last episode of the Ubuntu podcast a couple of months ago,

342
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
we had a bonus prediction that all three of us gave, which was by the next LTS in 2404, Ubuntu desktop will no longer be Gnome Shell-based.

343
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
And then we discussed it a bit and the outcome we decided was there'll be a new desktop and it will probably be Flutter-based.

344
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The way to do it, right, would be you get the LTS out the door and then you make the announcement and you start iterating between this LTS and the next one.

345
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That's the only way they could do it.

346
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah, you kind of got that anchor-based LTS for folks that are a bit nervous, perhaps.

347
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Right, which also gives strength to your announce, but not release.

348
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Fingers crossed.

349
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I think that's good.

350
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You want to try your second one?

351
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yeah, all right.

352
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Well, so I went spelunking in some of our past years and I realized in the past I made a few U-specific predictions, Chris.

353
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I thought I'd rekindle that past tradition.

354
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm going to predict that after doubling down on Tumbleweed on the server, you're going to start using it on the desktop in 2022.

355
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That seems insane to me at this point.

356
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't know.

357
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I mean, so any desktop at all or my primary daily driver?

358
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So I'm thinking it's in the category when you're trying to get work done on Linux.

359
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That's a Tumbleweed machine, whether that's like a laptop or your office workstation upstairs.

360
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I think you've got to be specific here.

361
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I think you've got to say either the laptop or the workstation upstairs with the funky screens.

362
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I think, yeah, I think that's good.

363
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I feel like I could give you a hint, but I don't want to.

364
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Like, should I help you or should I stay competitive?

365
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I don't know.

366
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's fair. That's fair.

367
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
All right. Well, I'll go with the laptop.

368
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Okay. All right. Lock it in.

369
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I predict that in 2022, Chris will be using OpenSUSE Tumbleweed on his laptop.

370
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Good call, because that ThinkPad would be the first place I try it.

371
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Because, you know, it's such a guaranteed to work standardized hardware base.

372
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
That's my go-to.

373
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So I think that was a good call.

374
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The desktop has been running Arch for a very long time, and it takes a big upset.

375
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Like, I haven't even put Fedora on that thing yet.

376
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
So, oh, boy, yeah, that tells you right there.

377
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Okay, Brent, I'd love to hear your first prediction for 2022.

378
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yeah. Okay, here we go.

379
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I predict that in 2022, Ubuntu snap by default another major Linux desktop application.

380
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So either LibreOffice or Thunderbird, to be more specific.

381
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
So two possibilities there, Ref. You good with that?

382
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah, I think if you're going to be specific about those two applications.

383
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I didn't want it to be too broad. That's no fun, right?

384
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So having a little bit of some specifics.

385
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Plus, they're two, I don't know, fairly large applications, not just like a small tool or something.

386
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So that feels right to me.

387
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Okay. All right.

388
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Log it in.

389
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:09,000
In 2022, Ubuntu will snap by default another major Linux desktop application, either LibreOffice or Thunderbird.

390
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
All right.

391
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It is locked, and I'm surprised I didn't think of that one, to tell you the truth.

392
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
That seems likely.

393
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm thinking through that list, which one's probably the biggest pain in their butt,

394
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
and which one could build off of a relationship they've already established?

395
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's Thunderbird there, right?

396
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
They've already done this with Firefox.

397
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
It seems like Thunderbird would be the next step.

398
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I don't know.

399
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
How many people use Thunderbird versus LibreOffice?

400
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Who will it affect?

401
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I was curious about this one because there's been a bit of backlash in the past,

402
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
and yet it seems to still be the direction they're going.

403
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So I don't know.

404
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm interested to see where this gets.

405
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I suppose it might get weighted by what's hardest to build to, like with Chromium.

406
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Right.

407
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That's what I wonder.

408
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I mean, just from past insights to this, for something like this to happen,

409
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
would it have to be initiated by LibreOffice or Mozilla slash Thunderbird,

410
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
or would it be initiated by Canonical, do you think?

411
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
No, not at all.

412
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I mean, in the case of Firefox, as you know, it was initiated by Mozilla,

413
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
but for others, it's initiated by Canonical.

414
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I think this is understandable, especially given that both of them are already snapped.

415
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
They're already available in the store.

416
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
They're already maintained by Canonical employees.

417
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
So I think it's a bit of a no-brainer that, yeah, this almost certainly would happen.

418
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
And you get bonus points, maybe, if both of them are done.

419
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Ooh, nice.

420
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I'll take that.

421
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, I think that's fair.

422
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Phobe's here rooting for us today.

423
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I love it.

424
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Okay, great.

425
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So those are pretty solid.

426
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I like that.

427
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I could see that happening.

428
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And I think you got one more for us.

429
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I do.

430
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I think this one might have been on all of our minds,

431
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
but I decided to make it a little bit specific.

432
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It has to do with Steam.

433
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I think the Linux monthly usage stats might go really high this year,

434
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
so I predict that they might just double.

435
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Hmm, okay.

436
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So we'll see the Steam user base double.

437
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So it's going to be above 2%, just a little bit above 2%,

438
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
you think, by this time next year?

439
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Well, double, I kind of had to look into this

440
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
because I figured Joe would be on me to be more specific.

441
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So gamingonlinux.com has the Steam Tracker,

442
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
and currently, at least November 2021,

443
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
they have stats that it's at 1.16% of their platform.

444
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
So doubling that 2.32%, I think, would be reasonable.

445
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
That's something measurable, right, Joe?

446
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Does that work?

447
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Yeah, I think what you've got to say in your lock-in

448
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
is specifically that the gaming on Linux Steam Tracker

449
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
will show that it is 2.32% or more.

450
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Okay.

451
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Just as an aside, a little math,

452
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
and that brings it to almost 3 million users,

453
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
which would be very interesting.

454
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
All right, lock it in, Brent.

455
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Steam's Linux monthly usage stats from gaming on Linux

456
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
will double to 2.32% at some point throughout 2022.

457
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I think if you just go even above 2.3%, that'd probably be a win.

458
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Drew told me this was maybe one of his predictions too.

459
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Drew, did I steal your thunder?

460
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah, a little bit.

461
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I was going to aim for 3%.

462
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Ooh, I like it.

463
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Three, bold.

464
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I actually, my initial thought was to triple,

465
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
but then I did the math on the actual numbers,

466
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
and I thought, no, that's not going to happen,

467
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
but maybe you're splitting that.

468
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Yeah, and I will say what's really going to make or break this

469
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
is if Steam Deck users get tracked as Linux users.

470
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
That's a very good point.

471
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
That's a very good point.

472
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
I would imagine they would.

473
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I don't see why they wouldn't, but perhaps...

474
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Hang on, that assumes that they don't install Windows

475
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
on their Steam Deck immediately.

476
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That's a risk.

477
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I can't see this happening.

478
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
In fact, I would say I can't see the Linux Steam percentage

479
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
going above 1.2, 1.3.

480
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Wow.

481
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Tell us more.

482
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Why?

483
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It's a percentage, and the other numbers are going to go up as well,

484
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and Linux isn't in a bubble,

485
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and there are people who are buying Windows machines as well,

486
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and I just can't see that the Steam Deck has enough market penetration

487
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and enough staying power for people who keep the OS that's already on there

488
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
for it to sustain all the way up to 3%.

489
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That's a gigantic jump.

490
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Poppy, I think you should lock in a counter-prediction to Brent here.

491
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Okay.

492
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
In 2022, the Linux Steam numbers, as represented by gaming on Linux,

493
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
will not crest more than 1.2 or 1.3%.

494
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
A brutal counter-prediction.

495
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I love it.

496
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Drew, why don't we stick with your predictions now?

497
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What do you see in the works for 2022?

498
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I see more vulnerabilities being exploited.

499
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Specifically, we're going to talk about log4j,

500
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and I'm going to predict that a log4j exploit attack

501
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
will cause greater than $100 million in damages to a single business.

502
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Okay, so the way we would validate this is seeing a headline

503
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
of like 100 million damages or more due to vulnerability exploit?

504
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Mm-hmm.

505
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
How do you feel, Ref?

506
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah, I think that's quantifiable.

507
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
All right, lock it in, Drew.

508
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I predict that in 2022, an attack against the log4j exploit

509
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
will result in greater than $100 million in damages

510
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
against a single business.

511
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I hope you're wrong on that one, you know?

512
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I do, too, because, you know, I work for a business

513
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
that could be affected by log4j,

514
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
although we have done our due diligence and closed the gaps,

515
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
but they're finding more and more stuff about it every day, so...

516
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It seems inevitable there's going to be something way down the stack

517
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
that we're not even looking at today that they'll discover.

518
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
In the chat room, the orange one says there was another log4j vulnerability

519
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
released just as we're live now, so...

520
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Oh, wow.

521
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Go figure.

522
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Gosh.

523
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Okay, all right.

524
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You got anything that's going to make me look forward to 2022?

525
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah, I wanted to have a positive one going into 2022,

526
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
and that's going to be...

527
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I think that System76 is going to release separate key cap sets

528
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
in different colorways and profiles for the launch keyboard.

529
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Shenanigans.

530
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Shenanigans?

531
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I call them shenanigans.

532
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You're too close to them.

533
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You've got insider knowledge, Drew.

534
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I actually don't on this.

535
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I have not actually hang out with anybody at System76

536
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
in a couple of months now.

537
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Okay.

538
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
All right.

539
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I believe you, so you want to lock it in.

540
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You good with that disclaimer out of the way?

541
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Sure.

542
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Okay.

543
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
All right, Drew, lock it in.

544
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I predict that in 2022,

545
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
System76 will release key cap sets in different colorways and profiles

546
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
for the launch keyboard.

547
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Dang it, I guess I'm going to have to finally buy a launch in 2022 then.

548
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And hook it up to that framework you're going to get.

549
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Right.

550
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Ref, we could do a bonus round with your...

551
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You have one prediction from last year.

552
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Do you want to own up to it?

553
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Okay, I kind of remember what it was now.

554
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
All right, here it is.

555
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I predict that in 2021,

556
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
you'll be able to use everything up to a browser in future.

557
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Ooh.

558
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Ooh.

559
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I don't think that one played out unless there's some fork, right?

560
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Okay.

561
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
No.

562
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The idea of my prediction is that it's totally silly

563
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
and very unlikely to happen.

564
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So do you have one for 2022?

565
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I do.

566
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
All right.

567
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's ridiculous.

568
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Okay.

569
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I predict that Bitcoin is going to go over $1 million.

570
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Ooh.

571
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Whoa.

572
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Whoa.

573
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I mean, since you're predicting,

574
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'll play ref here and I have no problem with that.

575
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I think that's a pretty easy one to measure.

576
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I think it's wild, but it's easy to measure.

577
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So you want to lock it in?

578
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Okay.

579
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I predict that at some point in 2022,

580
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Bitcoin will be worth more than $1 million.

581
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
All right.

582
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
So it just has to touch it and forbid there.

583
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Yeah, even if it crashes totally afterwards.

584
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I don't think it's going to happen really,

585
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
but wouldn't it be amazing if it did?

586
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Yeah.

587
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It would be the number one story.

588
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Everybody would be talking about it.

589
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Every time Bitcoin price starts to go up,

590
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
it becomes like this fascination with the mainstream media.

591
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And then the price drops back down and they stop talking about it.

592
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yeah.

593
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
But if it gets over $100,000, then there'll just be crazy mania.

594
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And then it'll get to $200,000, $250,000,

595
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
then half a million, and then a million.

596
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Who knows?

597
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Hmm.

598
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You know, just a couple of quick interesting Bitcoin stats.

599
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
In 2021, they reached 90% of all Bitcoins

600
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
that will ever be mined have now been mined.

601
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So their last 10% to 21 million is going to be a long,

602
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
hard slog for miners,

603
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
which likely implies that their cost to mine will go up,

604
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
which is probably going to mean the cost of a Bitcoin is going to go up

605
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
because the miners have got to recoup their investments there.

606
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
So, you know, there is some pressure there to bring that price up.

607
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You never know.

608
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Yeah, or they'll just all give up and go home.

609
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yeah, everybody buys Ethereum and cashes out a Bitcoin.

610
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Yeah.

611
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah.

612
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
All right.

613
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I've got a couple of predictions that I'll lay down

614
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
and see if you guys will accept.

615
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I'll start with one that I'd really like to see happen

616
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
because I think it'd be good long-term for them.

617
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
If they pull it off right,

618
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Flat Hub will begin a process of monetizing in some way in 2022.

619
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
And I could see this being either via pay-what-you-want app sales,

620
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
or I could see it being sponsored apps on Flat Hub.

621
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
But it's a way for the Flat Hub resource to start to produce some revenue

622
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
and ideally some revenue that developers of applications could share in

623
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
and would be motivated to go publish their apps on Flat Hub.

624
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Any thoughts?

625
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I mean, I can narrow that down,

626
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
but my general idea is Flat Hub monetizes in some way in 2022.

627
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
So they have been working on this for years,

628
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
and so it's definitely on the cards.

629
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I just wonder when they'll finally deliver it.

630
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah, all these things feel like we predict them,

631
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and then it takes like another two, three years for it to actually happen.

632
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Like they happen.

633
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It's just we always kind of get the timing wrong.

634
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
We think it's going to happen sooner than later,

635
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and we think things that are going to happen a long time down the road

636
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
happen sooner than anyways.

637
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
We mess up the timing.

638
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I suspect there may be intentional delays after they hear our predictions,

639
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
but I don't know.

640
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Messing with us, for sure.

641
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
For sure, Wes.

642
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
What do you think, Rev?

643
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Do I need to get more specific?

644
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Or can just Flat Hub monetize us in 2022?

645
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I think that just monetizing is a bit too vague.

646
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I think we need some specifics somehow.

647
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yeah, some amount of like,

648
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
is this like income received for the whatever foundation or nonprofit behind it?

649
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
How do we quantize this?

650
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You know what I'm inclined to do?

651
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I'm inclined to say they, to just get specific then,

652
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and say they launch a pay-for-what-you-want model in 2022.

653
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think the bigger thing to aim for that you might want to go for

654
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
is that they will add a paid system that limits applications you can install

655
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
until you've paid for them.

656
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Because pay-what-you-want means you can still install anything you like.

657
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But if they add the guardrails so that it's impossible to install this thing

658
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
until you've paid for it, and once you've paid for it,

659
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
you have the entitlement to own it and install it again and again and again,

660
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
that's a big thing, I think.

661
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
How do they pull this off technically, right?

662
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Because they're now pre-installed in a lot of different distributions,

663
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
app stores and app centers.

664
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So I remember having a conversation at Academy maybe three years ago

665
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
with the Flatpak people where they were saying,

666
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
you know, would SnapCraft be interested in collaborating on this

667
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and having a common platform for buying software on Linux?

668
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And I didn't think that was likely given that we'd already developed a paid model

669
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
which was then shut down and hasn't reared its head again.

670
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
So I know they've been working on for exactly that method,

671
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
for being able to pay for something and be entitled to use it

672
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and have some authentication server or something that says,

673
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
yes, you own that thing or no, you don't.

674
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Isn't the problem here that people don't buy software anymore?

675
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
They download the software for free and then sign in to that software

676
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
for their paid subscription.

677
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
You know, what we need is like some sort of distributed ledger

678
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
that has like a specific token that tracks who owns digital goods.

679
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You know, that would solve these kinds of problems.

680
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
You're onto something.

681
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So let's see here.

682
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
This is really tricky because the more I think about it,

683
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
technically the longer they stay free,

684
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the more integrated they've become into just standard desktop workflows

685
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and then to just throw a monetized strategy on there seems tricky.

686
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
How about sponsored apps?

687
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
They'll have sponsored featured apps on Flat Hub.

688
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
How about that?

689
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah, well, that's something they could do.

690
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I think they'd get some pushback for it, but they could certainly do it.

691
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
All right, I'm going to lock that in then.

692
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm going to say that in 2022, Flat Hub will feature sponsored applications.

693
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I hope.

694
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I mean, I hope they make some kind of revenue, for goodness sake.

695
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Yeah.

696
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
All right, now, if I didn't just give it away,

697
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
here's my second prediction.

698
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
This one I think is probably one of the riskier predictions,

699
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,000
but I think in 2022, an open source project will use some kind of NFT,

700
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
not a silly JPEG, but some kind of NFT to raise funds.

701
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Now, I think this is risky because NFTs are already getting associated with scams

702
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
and all kinds of silly stuff.

703
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
You see pushback from the gaming community,

704
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
and there will be people in the open source community

705
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
who probably do something kind of scammy with it, you know,

706
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
because that's a thing that happens.

707
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
There's grifters out there.

708
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
But if you zoom out a little bit and stop thinking about monkey JPEGs

709
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
and you think about it as a way to prove digital ownership of a good,

710
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
you could start to see how a project could make an NFT out of a pull request.

711
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Maybe something got merged and you make an NFT out of a screenshot of that.

712
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I mean, there's all kinds of stupid ways you could sell something

713
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
that a free software developer is doing as an NFT,

714
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
and they could make a few dollars here.

715
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Now, here's the other thing.

716
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Now, despite what you might like about cryptocurrencies

717
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
or what you might think about it, if you look at the last year,

718
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
there's been about 100% value gain for Bitcoin.

719
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And if you look at the year before that, it was 160%.

720
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
So it's possible that developers could actually raise funds

721
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
using an asset that goes up in value over time.

722
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So you buy this NFT pull request from the VLC project

723
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
and you pay them $100 in Ethereum.

724
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And at the end of the year, that Ethereum is now worth $300.

725
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And they cash it out and they've just made a profit on that.

726
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
That could be something we start to see happen in the podcast index.

727
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
They're starting to do this lightning network monetization strategy for podcasts.

728
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
We could see something like that with open source.

729
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But I think it's going to be something in the NFT space.

730
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
There'll be some of us that think, ah, this is a horrible idea.

731
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
And there'll be some that actually go for it.

732
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And there'll probably be enough people that they'll raise money.

733
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It might even bring people from outside the Linux community into this action

734
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
because I mean, NFTs are super popular right now.

735
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So my specific prediction would be an open source project uses an NFT to raise funds.

736
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah, well, that's easily quantifiable. We can easily test that.

737
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
It's a terrible, terrible idea, but it's almost certainly going to happen.

738
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Right. I think so, too. All right.

739
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So to lock it in, I'll say this.

740
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:35,000
In 2022, an open source project will use NFTs or an NFT alone to raise funds.

741
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Will there be cute pictures involved?

742
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I mean, you know, just as a side prediction.

743
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I mean, I don't think so. I mean, I don't know.

744
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,000
We need for this concept to work, you know, to show that you can raise funds for projects using digital scarcity.

745
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I feel like you're going to have to have a respectable project that does it in a respectable way.

746
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
And the first few that do it are going to set the pace.

747
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It's either going to blow up and be a grifter thing or it's going to be a reasonable way to buy one off unique things from open source projects that they can use to raise funds.

748
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
And it may not work out great either way, but somebody is going to try it.

749
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Who?

750
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I would think for it to really work, it would need to be a project that is known just outside the Linux community,

751
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
but a project that Windows and Mac users are familiar with, too, that maybe there's like a soft spot for, like some nostalgia, like VLC.

752
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
OBS. OBS. Come on.

753
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
OBS would be a great one, even Audacity possibly, but that's not going to happen.

754
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
But something that is recognized in the broader community, because what from the little bit of following of all this NFT stuff that I've done,

755
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
what I've noticed is it's drawing in a lot of the normals, people who are not like high end extreme geeks.

756
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
It's definitely got that, too. But normies are coming into this.

757
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It reaches outside the tech circle more so than I would have expected.

758
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
There's a certain distro that I think might do it, but I'm not going to say it on air just in case.

759
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I don't want to upset them.

760
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Okay, okay. I wonder. I wonder, but I think I know which one you're thinking of.

761
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
You know, I got a couple of grab bag items in here we could cover real quick.

762
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Alex said that he hopes we'll see a made for home assistant certification program launch.

763
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Oh, that'd be neat.

764
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And like I said, he's also predicting the 20 terabyte hard drive for under 250 again.

765
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
He's slotting that one in.

766
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
When we were going over this, I think the deck was probably the biggest question mark.

767
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Like, what's the deck impact going to be over 2022?

768
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Will there be deck OS clones that are, you know, available as a desktop distro?

769
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Like, what's that going to be? Will it even ship?

770
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Will it even ship? Yeah, I suppose that's a question right there.

771
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Yeah, I hope so. That'd be a blunder.

772
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I feel like it is. Like, that's probably what the delay was about a bit, was getting to something more doable.

773
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I think they had to reassess. Hopefully now they've got themselves a realistic timeline.

774
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But, you know, Valve time.

775
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Wes, did you throw the Ubuntu uses ButterFS by default in 2210 in the grab bag?

776
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Was that yours? No, that wasn't me. That was me.

777
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I was thinking maybe there might be a ButterFS in stream or like some version of one of the clones that sneakily added ButterFS back in maybe.

778
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Oh, man, wouldn't that be nice?

779
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Like a set of packages you could install on CentOS stream to get ButterFS support?

780
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Yeah, yeah. Oh, a boy can dream.

781
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
A boy can dream.

782
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And I noticed none of us had a specific Asahi Linux prediction.

783
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I made one in LAN, I think, but we didn't have any in this show about Asahi Linux.

784
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I thought you'd be all over that, Chris, since you've been following it so closely, but seems you went a little further out.

785
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It's so hard to know, right? It's so hard to know.

786
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
You don't want to tempt fate, right?

787
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Right. And like we were talking about earlier, that stuff is, that last 10% is really, really tricky.

788
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I thought about a stretch of saying maybe, you know, if enough of that stuff gets merged upstream, maybe Arch Linux ARM gets some support.

789
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I didn't have anything specific for Starlink either, although, man, talk about a lifesaver right now.

790
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It really has been just so great to be able to be.

791
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I was out here in the woods, did not plan to broadcast, did not plan to stream from here.

792
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I just got stranded, but I brought it with me and set it up, had to log in, change my service address.

793
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And then waited about 10, went for a walk, came back in about 15 minutes and it was all online.

794
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And, you know, I'm getting 100 megabits from the freaking woods. It's great.

795
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And, you know, it's cold out, right? I mean, at night it's down to five degrees Fahrenheit.

796
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
And that thing is actually what I've been doing.

797
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I wasn't sure how well it would do, but at night I've been turning it off to save power because we're in a pretty precarious situation.

798
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,000
And I just don't have any power to spare. So I turn it off at night using a smart plug and home assistant.

799
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And then in the morning I turn it on using the same system and it boots up in about three, five minutes.

800
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
It's connected to the network and the system just switches over from cellular to Starlink.

801
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
And then when I turn it off, it switches back to cellular. So that's worked out pretty good.

802
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
That's great. Did you get some hero shots of, you know, like, of course, the Starlink shining in its rugged terrain?

803
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Actually, for our live stream tweet today, if you check my Twitter profile,

804
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I have a shot of the Starlink out in the little dishy out in the snow.

805
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I have a Starlink prediction. You do?

806
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Well, I think Starlink might add data caps this year to their subscriptions.

807
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You shut your dirty mouth. I know. I'm not saying I want it. I'm not saying you want it.

808
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I'm just saying they got they got to do that at some point, right? Oh, no, I hope not.

809
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
You know, it has been so great not worrying about that anymore because it's such a pain in the butt on cellular.

810
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I'd pay I'd pay more. You know, they could nickel and dime me. I think it would be relatively high, but like unlimited unlimited just seems impossible.

811
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Yeah, especially when when you run out of bandwidth, your solution is like more ground stations and more satellites.

812
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So it's not it's not like when you're when that's what you got to do, that does take a lot of resources.

813
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
You just got to think of it as funding Starship. That's what you're doing.

814
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Yeah. Funding Elon's personal Mars Society is probably what we're doing.

815
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
OK. All right. Well, I'm feeling pretty good about these, you guys. This is a good range.

816
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Anybody have anything that we wanted to get in that we missed before we wrap it all up?

817
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It's a pretty good line up here. I feel like most of these have a pretty good shot compared to last year's batch, which were pretty bad.

818
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So we've got the orange one in the chat room and he has a prediction that I really hope happens.

819
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
You want to read it for us, Brent? Yeah. The prediction is in 2022, we see native Wayland support for Zoom.

820
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yes. Yes. It's about damn time. It really would be.

821
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And two bit has a prediction that due to supply chain issues, more electronic manufacturers will look to making their devices more repairable.

822
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Another good year for right to repair would be nice to see.

823
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Twenty twenty one was I feel like the best year for right to repair we've seen in a decade.

824
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So it'd be great to see that trend continue. Let's keep that momentum going.

825
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Yeah, here's hoping. Amen. From West's lips to the universe's ears, I say.

826
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
All right. Well, we got them all in here. I think we're going to start wrapping it up so that way I can hopefully escape the woods.

827
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:03,000
But remember, Linux Unplugged now is moving to Sundays at we're going to start around 12, 12, 30 Pacific at JBLive.TV.

828
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So join us over there. We usually get the stream started a little early and then, you know, the show gets going.

829
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Sometimes we're a little slow, but we we aim for just that we're going to aim for for every Sunday.

830
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And we'd love to have you hang out in our Mumble room. You can get information at that at Linux Unplugged dot com slash Mumble.

831
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,000
We also really appreciate your feedback. It's a great resource for the show for ideas and discussions.

832
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
You can send that in at Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

833
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,000
And if you're not going to be able to join us on Sundays anymore, if you've only been alive Tuesday listener, thank you so much for for joining us live when you could.

834
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And for most of you downloading, which is the vast majority, what this is going to mean is you're probably just going to get the show a day earlier.

835
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
You know, you're going to get one maybe maybe even a little earlier than that.

836
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
That's going to be the major change for the most people listening is the show will just come in a little bit earlier.

837
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So and hopefully we'll be on Sundays, we'll be always having a hoot and hollering good time because it's the weekend and not the middle of the work week and the middle of one of the busiest work days for me is Tuesday for whatever reason.

838
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Less stress, more fun. Linux Unplugged 2022. Lock that in.

839
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I say, Wes, thank you, everyone, for joining us.

840
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Links to nothing really, because we didn't talk about much, but user Linux Unplugged dot com.

841
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And for one last time, thank you so much for joining us on a Tuesday and we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

842
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You.
