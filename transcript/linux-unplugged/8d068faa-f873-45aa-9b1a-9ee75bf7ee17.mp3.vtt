WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
anybody in the mumble room using something besides just the default

00:03.600 --> 00:08.400
terminal for their desktop like I love I love console so that's almost always the

00:08.400 --> 00:12.840
one I go to but anybody using something besides the default like term X

00:12.840 --> 00:20.440
terminator terminator yeah yeah oh really okay I I recommend hyper

00:20.440 --> 00:24.560
Pokemon this is something that dark crack team here at Linux unplugged has

00:24.560 --> 00:29.180
discovered and I just want you to give it a consideration it's wondrous

00:29.180 --> 00:33.720
tailor-made Pokemon themes for hyper terminal okay so just give that a

00:33.720 --> 00:36.360
consideration while the link in the show notes it's for all you Pokemon

00:36.360 --> 00:45.720
enthusiasts this is Linux unplugged episode 202 for June 20th 2017

00:54.280 --> 00:58.240
Oh welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show where your host

00:58.240 --> 01:03.600
is being bombarded by BSD enthusiasts it's a full-on attack I'll tell you more

01:03.600 --> 01:07.960
about that later out of the show mr. West is in route right now battling

01:07.960 --> 01:12.120
Seattle traffic but the show goes on he'll be slipstreaming himself into the

01:12.120 --> 01:16.240
show he'll be live patching himself into the podcast in a little bit in the

01:16.240 --> 01:19.680
meantime we have some community updates to get through including some really

01:19.680 --> 01:24.480
important security news for Kmail users up front huge update from the fedora

01:24.480 --> 01:29.440
project we're gonna dig into some shenanigans going on out there we'll

01:29.440 --> 01:33.760
tell you about that there's a mystery afoot and some mess what I know it's

01:33.760 --> 01:38.200
very confusing and then mr. Michael Hall joins us formally from canonical now at

01:38.200 --> 01:42.840
endless to tell us what he and endless is up to and then towards the very end

01:42.840 --> 01:47.800
of the show we have a random grab bag I have some updates on something we talked

01:47.800 --> 01:52.120
about last week and if time permits although we have so much stuff to get to

01:52.120 --> 01:55.720
this week I have an interview from the floor of self that we haven't had a

01:55.720 --> 02:00.200
chance to play yet in the show now it's not super time-critical so if time

02:00.200 --> 02:03.720
doesn't permit never fear we could always sneak it into later time but if

02:03.720 --> 02:07.840
the show permits we'll get to that so before we jump into all of our community

02:07.840 --> 02:12.100
updates for episode 202 before I start talking about the barbecue coming up in

02:12.100 --> 02:16.400
a couple of weeks before we get to our follow-up let's bring in our mumble room

02:16.400 --> 02:26.600
time-approved screening mumble room Wow I feel like I feel like if I was in a

02:26.600 --> 02:31.040
room and we were in a physical room and you all did that I would nearly go into

02:31.040 --> 02:35.080
an anxiety attack but for some reason you're all coming into my headphones I

02:35.080 --> 02:38.440
maybe it's even more intense but thank you guys for being here I'm looking

02:38.440 --> 02:43.000
forward to chatting about all this stuff Michael welcome back to the show mr.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.800
Hall it's good to have you like this is your third time I think you might be a

02:45.800 --> 02:50.600
record holder yeah do you do like the SNL like five-timer jacket or something

02:50.600 --> 02:53.320
I think I should get one of those I think we should I think we should

02:53.320 --> 02:57.920
probably you could be the person that starts that tradition you never know and

02:57.920 --> 03:01.680
it would be a good jacket too like not one of these WWDC jeans jacket but all

03:01.680 --> 03:07.840
really nice materials I'm afraid you'd have to give Alan and Martin like a full

03:07.840 --> 03:11.760
wardrobe though yeah there'd have to be a line between like occasional guests

03:11.760 --> 03:15.280
and frequent contributor because those guys basically would have not just the

03:15.280 --> 03:19.840
wardrobe but they'd also have to have like a whole line of like swag just for

03:19.840 --> 03:23.200
them of them for their attendance although although to be fair if you keep

03:23.200 --> 03:25.400
it up at this rate you might beat them because they've been very busy on

03:25.400 --> 03:31.160
Tuesdays recently so they haven't been able to join us of course it is

03:31.160 --> 03:35.320
obviously I mean what else you got going on so we do have a few really positive

03:35.320 --> 03:38.520
stories to get into but I wanted to cover one that's I don't know if I don't

03:38.520 --> 03:41.320
know if negative is the right way to describe it but I did want to cover one

03:41.320 --> 03:46.120
that is pretty important for Kmail users Kmail send later feature when combined

03:46.120 --> 03:53.600
with K K mails PGP support didn't work and so if you were scheduling emails

03:53.600 --> 03:56.520
with the understanding that they'd be encrypted when they were sent later

03:56.520 --> 04:00.280
those emails were getting sent in the clear text they were just getting sent

04:00.280 --> 04:03.240
plain text no encryption applied at all even though the UI would suggest

04:03.240 --> 04:07.320
encryption was being applied to that email the back-end scheduler that

04:07.320 --> 04:13.160
actually grabbed that queue and sent the emails off didn't go through the open

04:13.160 --> 04:18.480
PGP system and so those routines were completely bypassed leading to the email

04:18.480 --> 04:22.760
being sent in plain text without being signed or encrypted which is even just

04:22.760 --> 04:26.240
getting not not getting signed is a big deal and so the bug would lead to

04:26.240 --> 04:31.680
unintentional information disclosure of private messages and it's CVE 2017 96 04

04:31.680 --> 04:36.560
how about that and the KD project is aware of it versions 4.11 that's when

04:36.560 --> 04:43.920
the send later feature was introduced and 1704.1 are vulnerable Kmail version

04:43.920 --> 04:50.880
so it's versions between 4.11 guys to 1704 Kmail version 1704.2 released on

04:50.880 --> 04:55.320
June 8th of this year contains a fix for the problem and so this is one of those

04:55.320 --> 05:00.200
where I'm not sure what distros are patching I haven't I didn't look into

05:00.200 --> 05:03.720
that but I'm not sure if it's getting back ported to older desktop versions by

05:03.720 --> 05:09.880
the distro maintainers or what there is there is several there are several links

05:09.880 --> 05:13.440
that more information about it but that just is one of those things you know

05:13.440 --> 05:16.840
it's just like you you're using a tool you think you're using encryption and

05:16.840 --> 05:19.640
maybe you have a reason why you especially like when you're doing this

05:19.640 --> 05:24.680
type of communications you had very limited amounts of doing some of our

05:24.680 --> 05:28.760
work for some of our other shows timing is sometimes kind of an important thing

05:28.760 --> 05:30.880
about it because like you're writing somebody something and you want to send

05:30.880 --> 05:35.040
it off after something after a piece of news breaks or after after a story comes

05:35.040 --> 05:38.040
out then you want the email so the timing thing of really sensitive

05:38.040 --> 05:42.200
communication turns out to be pretty pretty important so this is a this is

05:42.200 --> 05:47.720
one of those where if I have I ran a Linux critics blog I would be extremely

05:47.720 --> 05:53.520
harsh about this because it's an example I think of a vulnerability and I don't

05:53.520 --> 05:56.040
need to harp on this too hardly but I do think it's an example of a

05:56.040 --> 06:01.240
vulnerability that if say

06:01.520 --> 06:08.880
Gmail had this problem or even say Apple Mail on the iPhone had this problem it

06:08.880 --> 06:13.760
would be there would be mobs in the streets there would be mobs in the

06:13.760 --> 06:18.760
streets about about this lack of security and this simple obvious amateur

06:18.760 --> 06:25.280
mistake by these companies but when it's K mail and we all love the the K mail

06:25.280 --> 06:29.560
folks I mean it's not like we want to blame shame anybody here but when it's K

06:29.560 --> 06:32.160
mail we're all just like oh okay good I'll go and get those patches installed

06:32.160 --> 06:37.680
and then we don't really even talk about I mean this is this is a story from June

06:37.680 --> 06:42.240
and I was like nobody's talking about this so I think it's an I think it's

06:42.240 --> 06:44.760
worth mentioning

06:46.080 --> 06:49.820
a HRS points out they don't you says it's a Gmail doesn't support GPG but you

06:49.820 --> 06:53.600
get my drift right if there was a critical vulnerability in something like

06:53.600 --> 06:58.160
this in a in a commercial product we how we hold it to a different standard

06:58.160 --> 07:01.560
WW do you agree do you I mean you see what I'm saying here at least like if

07:01.560 --> 07:05.540
this was Gmail that had a flaw of this magnitude I feel like there would be a

07:05.540 --> 07:09.000
totally different level not just because the users are larger but because the

07:09.000 --> 07:14.800
expectations are different or do you think oh yeah yeah I think if this was

07:14.800 --> 07:20.400
happening on Gmail and I like I'm a Gmail user even though I'm going through

07:20.400 --> 07:24.680
Thunderbird I would probably demand a fence you know you would have want to be

07:24.680 --> 07:29.480
left out of this you know former bro Levy and have your stuff out and open

07:29.480 --> 07:33.320
and to their credit you know they when they found out about it they hustled to

07:33.320 --> 07:36.320
get it fixed and they've been really clear on their communication about it's

07:36.320 --> 07:38.880
not like they're trying to like snuff the story out it just doesn't seem to

07:38.880 --> 07:45.120
get maybe I mean I'm sure user base size must be part of it I don't know feels

07:45.120 --> 07:48.240
like more than that though one of the stories getting a lot of traction is

07:48.240 --> 07:54.040
this post by Christian Shaler on the future of fedora just even beyond

07:54.040 --> 07:58.280
workstation 26 and there's a couple of things I pulled out in here that have me

07:58.280 --> 08:02.160
super excited about just long term fedora not not a lot of stuff we get our

08:02.160 --> 08:05.760
hands on immediately but long term they're working on improving integration

08:05.760 --> 08:09.960
of the NVIDIA binary driver which is kind of remarkable talking about the

08:09.960 --> 08:12.240
fedora project here but they think they have a salute they're gonna have a

08:12.240 --> 08:15.520
solution in place where you can use the NVIDIA driver when you want the extra

08:15.520 --> 08:19.440
graphics and graphics power and they think that it's going to be a pretty

08:19.440 --> 08:24.200
smooth installation and they're also working on a fleet commander which will

08:24.200 --> 08:28.560
allow which will be a tool essentially to allow you to manage fedora and red

08:28.560 --> 08:32.600
hat enterprise desktop centrally it's a tool that's really targeted more like

08:32.600 --> 08:36.600
universities and large installations but I don't know it could be pretty cool and

08:36.600 --> 08:39.880
the the other thing is they're gonna help you integrate it with their free

08:39.880 --> 08:43.520
IPA suite of tools so it's essentially going to give you an LDAP active

08:43.520 --> 08:47.760
directory style like active directory support but the one that I really want

08:47.760 --> 08:50.520
to talk about in this post and I think this is probably why this post is

08:50.520 --> 08:54.640
getting the most attention is pipewire we've talked about it before on the show

08:54.640 --> 09:00.000
when it was called pinnows and now it's been renamed to pipewire and they're

09:00.000 --> 09:05.520
increasing the scope of what pipewire is going to accomplish so think of it maybe

09:05.520 --> 09:12.480
at first pass as pulse audio for everything video and audio it aims at

09:12.480 --> 09:16.680
unifying Linux audio and video the long-term goal is for pipewire to not

09:16.680 --> 09:23.120
only provide handling of video streams but also handle all kinds of audio

09:23.120 --> 09:30.600
wow I got to stop right there that if they pull that off that's the homefield

09:30.600 --> 09:35.480
advantage Mac OS has for media production because they they have that

09:35.480 --> 09:40.960
whole quick time and core audio and core video system worked out where there's

09:40.960 --> 09:48.160
just API's available and Final Cut 10 just sits on top of that technology so

09:48.160 --> 09:50.760
they're spending a lot of time to make sure that pipewire can handle audio in a

09:50.760 --> 09:55.440
way that not only addresses pulse audio use cases but also the ones that are

09:55.440 --> 10:01.880
handled by Jack today wow a big part of motivation for this is they want to make

10:01.880 --> 10:06.280
fedora workstation the best place to create content and we want the pro audio

10:06.280 --> 10:14.000
crowd to be first-class citizens of our desktop oh my god wow so this is huge

10:14.000 --> 10:19.320
this is really really huge is if they can if they can get this even close it's

10:19.320 --> 10:23.000
gonna be it's gonna be a phenomenal phenomenal groundwork for multimedia

10:23.000 --> 10:27.480
applications also flat packs so they expect to start shipping pipewire in

10:27.480 --> 10:32.760
fedora workstation 27 which is pretty soon if you think about it but it it's

10:32.760 --> 10:35.880
only gonna be sort of like the first version the really early stuff it's gonna

10:35.880 --> 10:39.480
handle video and they say one of the reasons they need to do that is to

10:39.480 --> 10:43.120
handle video for flat back applications because I got a they got to give it like

10:43.120 --> 10:46.960
up they got a poke a portal for video and so they're gonna also provide an API

10:46.960 --> 10:51.760
for flat packs and get ready for this

10:52.640 --> 11:00.160
an API for screen capture under Wayland this is one of the number one questions

11:00.160 --> 11:05.000
I get about Wayland I had one just just it came into the show 45 minutes before

11:05.000 --> 11:08.440
I went on air what about what about remote access to Wayland what about

11:08.440 --> 11:13.680
screen capture software in Wayland this is gonna be huge for desktop users of

11:13.680 --> 11:17.240
Wayland that wanted to screen capture that that want to maybe have a remote

11:17.240 --> 11:21.260
desktop system this could lead to all of that potentially so pipewire to the

11:21.260 --> 11:25.760
rescue for more for media production and also for the Wayland transition then

11:25.760 --> 11:34.280
there was this moment oh man I wish Wes was in here so I could see his face in

11:34.280 --> 11:39.160
this one so they make a post and they make a part in here little section here

11:39.160 --> 11:42.840
about fractional scaling for high DPI systems fractional scaling a lot of talk

11:42.840 --> 11:45.760
about that recently we've been talking about that recently because there was

11:45.760 --> 11:50.080
that hack fest between canonical and gnome developers at canonicals what was

11:50.080 --> 11:54.240
it Taipei offices well it turns out fedora workstation has been leading the

11:54.240 --> 11:58.400
charge in supporting high DPI on Linux they write and they hope to build on

11:58.400 --> 12:02.400
that current work to enable fractional scaling support where they link to the

12:02.400 --> 12:07.520
gnome.org blog post about the fractional scaling hack fest and he goes on to talk

12:07.520 --> 12:10.200
about the importance of fractional scaling now they're gonna be there to

12:10.200 --> 12:13.720
support that when it's ready and some great work also going into just the

12:13.720 --> 12:16.880
general performance of gnome shell all this almost feels like a direct

12:16.880 --> 12:22.920
criticism response of mine recently and I'm happy to see this they are closing

12:22.920 --> 12:27.960
bugs on small little performance issues in mutter and gnome shell it's coming on

12:27.960 --> 12:33.080
top of earlier work that they've done and while it's a real you know subjective

12:33.080 --> 12:37.480
thing they are working on quote-unquote gnomes performance and quote-unquote

12:37.480 --> 12:41.240
gnomes overhead to make gnome shell even more performant in future versions of

12:41.240 --> 12:44.760
fedora which of course is going to benefit everyone using the gnome desktop

12:44.760 --> 12:51.040
then there's a little note in here about flat packs they say essentially what

12:51.040 --> 12:54.560
we're doing is making it very simple for a fedora maintainer to build a flat pack

12:54.560 --> 12:57.200
of an application they maintain through the fedora package building

12:57.200 --> 13:04.440
infrastructure and push that flat back into a central flat pack registry hmm so

13:04.440 --> 13:08.200
they're gonna make it easier for people to ship flat packs as well good stuff

13:08.200 --> 13:13.120
overall about about about firmware updates they're getting closer to

13:13.120 --> 13:15.680
shipping codecs just as everybody's streaming things and it doesn't matter

13:15.680 --> 13:19.640
anymore yeah we're glad we fought that and this is a big one I will end on this

13:19.640 --> 13:23.080
I think yeah we'll end on this yeah this will be good battery life they're

13:23.080 --> 13:27.560
looking into hopefully making a dent here they say for a while now we've been

13:27.560 --> 13:30.680
digging into this and we'll hopefully share information soon on which laptops

13:30.680 --> 13:35.640
users should buy that will have good battery life under fedora hmm they also

13:35.640 --> 13:40.760
have a they they have a point Christian Kellner or Kellner is the main point on

13:40.760 --> 13:44.080
battery life and taking up improving battery life benchmark tools that they

13:44.080 --> 13:48.880
use so hopefully we'll see a distribution taking battery life very

13:48.880 --> 13:52.200
seriously one that's very gnome focused again pretty good because it turns out a

13:52.200 --> 13:56.000
lot of districts are shipping something based on no shell these days that's a

13:56.000 --> 14:00.360
lot of that's a lot of stuff coming for fedora after just last week I said it's

14:00.360 --> 14:03.680
fine it's fine it's all right is anybody in the mumble room have any

14:03.680 --> 14:10.440
reactions or responses to any of that stuff that I just rambled on about go

14:10.440 --> 14:19.400
ahead no only the Western already does a spawn RTP back end so oh oh okay I I

14:19.400 --> 14:22.720
guess I think you may have heard that yeah do you just put in the term I'd

14:22.720 --> 14:27.040
love to know more about that so it's like a full-on RDP like Microsoft

14:27.040 --> 14:31.800
remote desktop protocol back end for Weston basically using free RDP and

14:31.800 --> 14:36.760
using those libraries as well so there is an implementation of it for wayland

14:36.760 --> 14:39.800
but only in Western for some reason I don't know why the desktop something up

14:39.800 --> 14:45.560
hmm yeah well and Weston is sort of like the reference right so if they just they

14:45.560 --> 14:48.360
don't have to necessarily choose to use that part of the reference of limitation

14:48.360 --> 14:53.520
I suppose no I mean they could use their own interface for the libraries they

14:53.520 --> 14:57.280
could but they just see the talk is there so I think part of it is to like a

14:57.280 --> 15:01.720
lot of them are adapting their existing compositors or existing systems to use

15:01.720 --> 15:05.480
wayland instead of creating something from scratch so maybe some of that might

15:05.480 --> 15:08.400
be belted on later I don't know that's interesting that you know I'm gonna I'm

15:08.400 --> 15:11.600
gonna take a look at that more thanks for attuned it for for linking that

15:11.600 --> 15:15.000
that's pretty cool that's pretty cool anyways we'll have a link to the fedora

15:15.000 --> 15:21.440
26 workstation post I go ahead sorry I think the flat back thing is rather

15:21.440 --> 15:26.720
interesting tell me does that could some kind of replace the PPAs of Ubuntu if

15:26.720 --> 15:32.240
you have a build server that can build some flag packs out of the sources you

15:32.240 --> 15:36.200
imagine the same thing as snap packages with to get service like some kind of

15:36.200 --> 15:43.260
open build service yeah that would be rather cool I think that you that would

15:43.260 --> 15:48.120
be really cool you guys know about flat hub right so this is I think separate

15:48.120 --> 15:51.680
than flat hub but no go tell go on about flat that's cuz it's pretty interesting

15:51.680 --> 15:58.640
so flat hub is this kind of centralized flat pack repository it spun out of the

15:58.640 --> 16:03.160
gnome work it's independent of gnome now and trying to get buy-in from app

16:03.160 --> 16:07.560
developers and platform developers and it's really just to ease discovery and

16:07.560 --> 16:12.160
distribution of flat packs by having one place where you know distros can set up

16:12.160 --> 16:16.960
by default users can just go there and find whatever apps are available yeah

16:16.960 --> 16:19.360
they're there they were last week we talked a little bit about they're

16:19.360 --> 16:23.920
looking to raise some funding and I like that they're I like that they're trying

16:23.920 --> 16:29.080
to set something up that's independent which is great and whenever you're

16:29.080 --> 16:32.240
trying to figure out like what software is available it's nice to have a central

16:32.240 --> 16:36.280
place to go to go see what applications so if you go to flat pack org slash apps

16:36.280 --> 16:41.040
dot HTML you can get all the GUI or command-line apps there's quite a bit of

16:41.040 --> 16:44.880
stuff really I mean there's some good stuff in here like core bird is pretty

16:44.880 --> 16:50.400
nice and discord and gnome mpv shoot shoot yeah so there's some good stuff in

16:50.400 --> 16:57.760
there and yeah flat pack flat pack org slash apps dot HTML for that yeah I I

16:57.760 --> 17:01.720
think that's fascinating so speaking of competing technologies that's kind of a

17:01.720 --> 17:08.680
similar similar trend everybody's everybody's friend Lenart Pottering has

17:08.680 --> 17:15.760
a new tool new a new project and it's ca-sync casa-sync I'm not sure ca-sync

17:15.760 --> 17:21.360
I'm gonna call it and it's it's it's a tool for distributing file system images

17:21.360 --> 17:25.760
it combines the idea of the our sync algorithm with the idea of git style

17:25.760 --> 17:30.200
content addressable file systems and creates a new system for efficiently

17:30.200 --> 17:35.340
storing and delivering file system images and for optimizing for high

17:35.340 --> 17:40.160
frequency update cycles over the internet with a focus on delivering to

17:40.160 --> 17:45.640
IOT devices containers VMs applications portable services or entire OS images

17:45.640 --> 17:50.080
but he hopes to extend it to later in later on down the road to more of a

17:50.080 --> 17:53.080
generic way a fashion to become useful for backups and home directory

17:53.080 --> 17:58.040
synchronization as well and he goes through his blog post here and says he

17:58.040 --> 18:01.320
took a look at the different approaches out there he says he wanted something

18:01.320 --> 18:05.320
that made updates cheap he wanted something that respected boundaries on

18:05.320 --> 18:08.120
disk space and usage on servers something that was friendly to content

18:08.120 --> 18:12.760
distribution networks something that was simple and he does specifically in here

18:12.760 --> 18:17.540
address systems that operate on block layer and replace squash FS images you

18:17.540 --> 18:20.720
know I don't updates and they just right over the squash FS image and then mount

18:20.720 --> 18:26.680
it he seems to not like that approach which I think is kind of the I could be

18:26.680 --> 18:30.360
wrong on the details but I think it's kind of the Ubuntu core approach and he

18:30.360 --> 18:34.320
wants to he goes on to say later on delivering direct squash FS or other

18:34.320 --> 18:37.560
file system images is almost beautifully simple but of course it means every

18:37.560 --> 18:42.040
update requires a full download of the newest image which is both bad for disk

18:42.040 --> 18:46.240
usage and for generated traffic even though you can try to hack it with z-sync

18:46.240 --> 18:49.880
and things like that he says besides the issues I pointed out already I just

18:49.880 --> 18:54.120
wasn't happy with the security and root reproducibility properties of these

18:54.120 --> 19:00.840
systems either so this isn't like a flat pack snap packages alternative but it is

19:00.840 --> 19:07.000
like a whole new way to distribute OS updates and images I think he was

19:07.000 --> 19:09.720
working on something in the past that use butter FS to accomplish something

19:09.720 --> 19:13.360
kind of similar to this but this is different than like say are just using

19:13.360 --> 19:20.400
our sink or OS tree or similar tools because those tools he is doing

19:20.400 --> 19:23.680
something where he's removing all of the file boundaries and then he chunks

19:23.680 --> 19:27.720
things up small files get lumped together with their siblings large files

19:27.720 --> 19:31.920
get chopped into pieces and then he can recognize similarities between all of

19:31.920 --> 19:36.280
those files beyond just there you know beyond the file boundaries make sure all

19:36.280 --> 19:41.800
the chunks are distributed and then send them around and the chunking algorithm

19:41.800 --> 19:47.040
is based on buzz hash which is a rolling hash function and shaw 256 is used to

19:47.040 --> 19:52.120
store the hash functions to generate the digits of the chunks I know it's super

19:52.120 --> 19:58.000
complicated it's all up on its blog up on his blog post what do you think

19:58.000 --> 20:02.120
www you loving this no I'm not loving it because it reminds me of how I'm

20:02.120 --> 20:08.560
recovering files and I can't even use any of hash functionality or anything to

20:08.560 --> 20:15.440
double-check files and I have one files merged with other files and compressed

20:15.440 --> 20:22.000
containers and all kinds of junk so no this just does not sound appealing to

20:22.000 --> 20:30.600
me at all I I feel like it is complicated to understand and this

20:30.600 --> 20:35.880
diagram isn't doing any benefits but there are other operating systems out

20:35.880 --> 20:40.200
there like plan 9 and there's other systems out there that have this

20:40.200 --> 20:44.720
functionality at an OS level and it's it's really nice because you can

20:44.720 --> 20:48.040
essentially send a system from one system to the other system booted up and

20:48.040 --> 20:52.520
it's live you can clone it you can you can send an update over the internet and

20:52.520 --> 20:57.800
if it fails you know you have recourse you can slowly trickle something to a

20:57.800 --> 21:01.120
device when you have a limited bandwidth connection and then have it assemble the

21:01.120 --> 21:04.640
updates on its side and then do itself you know screw itself over in the

21:04.640 --> 21:12.520
upgrade process so I I totally recognize on the surface of it a need that it

21:12.520 --> 21:15.520
seems to be addressing just like I did with system D when when system D was

21:15.520 --> 21:19.000
announced then I was like oh yeah like the network socket stuff and some of

21:19.000 --> 21:23.800
these other things are really pretty useful in the server space this is one

21:23.800 --> 21:28.680
of those where when you have systems that have all kinds of random ass

21:28.680 --> 21:33.320
containers or dozens of containers running on it you do kind of need a way

21:33.320 --> 21:36.200
to manage all of it that sort of standardized at the OS level that goes

21:36.200 --> 21:43.240
just beyond beyond just software delivery but actually addresses

21:43.240 --> 21:47.920
delivering and managing the operating system and you do want something that's

21:47.920 --> 21:52.120
sort of almost like the plumbing level and he's pretty good at that kind of

21:52.120 --> 21:57.200
stuff but I do wonder if it's competing with other solutions that have already

21:57.200 --> 22:00.120
been created I got to learn more I'm gonna study more into it but if anybody

22:00.120 --> 22:03.400
else has done a deep dive and can help me figure it out I'd appreciate it whole

22:03.400 --> 22:06.400
thing is really fascinating he talks about where it could go down the road

22:06.400 --> 22:09.800
talks about how you can operate at the block level or the file system level

22:09.800 --> 22:15.840
anyways there's there's he's already I mean he's already got essentially this

22:15.840 --> 22:18.440
is what's crazy about Lenart he's already essentially built the whole damn

22:18.440 --> 22:23.000
basics here he's got functional code you can use right now I really I just find

22:23.000 --> 22:26.680
this to be one of those one of those things where it's he creates something

22:26.680 --> 22:30.640
that's slightly slightly thought-provoking and sometimes causes a

22:30.640 --> 22:35.360
strong reaction and it's so ca-sync and we'll have a link in the show notes if

22:35.360 --> 22:42.120
you want to see more about that ca-sync by Lenart quite the quite the transition

22:42.120 --> 22:45.800
he's made over the years anybody else have any thoughts on it before we move on

22:45.800 --> 22:50.560
I'll throw in a quick related story I guess I have I guess I have a thought

22:50.560 --> 22:53.960
then if nobody else does just a quick update canonical has released a new

22:53.960 --> 22:58.560
stable version of the snap craft utility for creating snap packages and this one

22:58.560 --> 23:02.320
supports resuming downloads of the core snap when a building them like a when

23:02.320 --> 23:05.320
building a classic snap or an air occurs or something like that the package can't

23:05.320 --> 23:08.440
be if you know this just happens sometimes you can't fetch do you can't

23:08.440 --> 23:12.980
fetch and this is going to be very handy for anybody that's trying to do that or

23:12.980 --> 23:16.680
people that are doing continuous integration they will continually be

23:16.680 --> 23:19.040
downloading pulling things down and sometimes the snap just fails to grab

23:19.040 --> 23:22.160
something and this is gonna help that maybe the connection resets cuz like for

23:22.160 --> 23:25.800
me I'm on a my file lot this can be really cool so good for them everything

23:25.800 --> 23:29.880
is continuing to move forward I say it's it's good to see all kinds you've got

23:29.880 --> 23:34.800
flat we got news on flat packs we got news on snap packages Katie and live

23:34.800 --> 23:37.960
today just announced that they're shipping the next test version of Katie

23:37.960 --> 23:41.000
and live via app image for the first time or like they said something about

23:41.000 --> 23:44.040
the first time we're shipping this an app image so they're still doubling

23:44.040 --> 23:46.880
they've been talking about it before but they're doubling down an app image it is

23:46.880 --> 23:53.720
and now let notes got see a sink so welcome to Linux everybody it's a party

23:53.720 --> 24:03.080
hey and you're welcome to join it and just bring your own booze now I don't

24:03.080 --> 24:06.080
know what to make of it I don't I don't care it's just as long as I can install

24:06.080 --> 24:10.080
software if I could pick one I'd probably go with snaps or app images but

24:10.080 --> 24:14.640
I'm happy with flat packs do I'll take PPA 2.0 just get it to me just just yeah

24:14.640 --> 24:19.600
BYO packaging exactly you know let's talk about digital ocean for a second

24:19.600 --> 24:21.600
let's take a moment and talk about something that's really simple and

24:21.600 --> 24:25.280
straightforward it's an easy way to spin up a Linux rig on their super powerful

24:25.280 --> 24:29.160
infrastructure in just seconds and probably less than a minute you could

24:29.160 --> 24:32.200
have a Linux system up on one of their many data centers all over the world

24:32.200 --> 24:36.920
with a 40 gigabit connection coming into that hypervisor they got SSD storage for

24:36.920 --> 24:42.440
everything an interface that is so easy to use if you're a total noob or a long

24:42.440 --> 24:47.200
time expert you're gonna have a good time and then when you're ready to grow

24:47.200 --> 24:51.320
it's easy to increase your memory attach highly available block storage it's also

24:51.320 --> 24:56.560
all SSD based a simple I API when you start having multiple systems monitoring

24:56.560 --> 24:59.640
alerting to make you look like a boss and you're on top of things load

24:59.640 --> 25:04.400
balancing as a service and ladies and gentlemen a brand new baby coming soon

25:04.400 --> 25:13.240
object storage yeah yeah and if you sign up for early access you can receive one

25:13.240 --> 25:19.280
terabyte for free through October 31st oh my gosh they don't they don't like

25:19.280 --> 25:22.600
they don't ever rest like they don't do they just never take a vacation over a

25:22.600 --> 25:25.440
digital ocean they're wrong like they just rolled out the new cloud firewall

25:25.440 --> 25:29.760
which is such a brilliant thing now this object storage a simple easy cost

25:29.760 --> 25:38.680
effective way man this is brilliant digital ocean is just killing it go to

25:38.680 --> 25:43.200
digital ocean calm use our promo code do unplugged apply that after you create

25:43.200 --> 25:46.680
your account you get a $10 credit and you can start messing around build a

25:46.680 --> 25:51.840
system put it in production learn more digital ocean calm and use our promo code

25:51.840 --> 25:56.080
do unplugged it's all one word you just apply it to your account digital ocean

25:56.080 --> 26:02.080
calm promo code do unplugged so you heard mr. Michael Hall just a little bit

26:02.080 --> 26:07.200
ago chatting with us and he joins us today but not from canonical anymore but

26:07.200 --> 26:14.240
from now now flying the endless flag is the is the flag is it sort of is it is

26:14.240 --> 26:17.440
it like really well rounded on the corners and with beautiful

26:17.440 --> 26:25.960
translucencies and what's that flag look like Michael welcome back to the color

26:25.960 --> 26:30.000
scheme I'm I'm picking up the whole thing it's a big change and yet not a

26:30.000 --> 26:34.840
whole big change so I was talking about endless a few weeks ago on the show when

26:34.840 --> 26:38.040
I was talking about how I think the future for gnome is extremely bright

26:38.040 --> 26:40.840
beyond just the fact that more people are working on it and everybody just a

26:40.840 --> 26:44.200
lot of things are lining up for gnome right now and on my list of things that

26:44.200 --> 26:48.040
are lining up for gnome in the positive direction was endless and endless OS

26:48.040 --> 26:52.920
which I believe is based on gnome shell am I right it is yeah it's got a

26:52.920 --> 26:57.240
modified version of gnome shell so what is the what is endless about what is

26:57.240 --> 27:00.960
sort of the elevator pitch on to endless for people that aren't familiar so the

27:00.960 --> 27:05.760
company's mission summed up in a single sentence is the whole world empowered

27:05.760 --> 27:12.440
and it's basically there are about three billion people who want a desktop but

27:12.440 --> 27:17.800
don't have access to one for one reason or another and the company's mission is

27:17.800 --> 27:23.280
to make a desktop that works for them price point they have the internet that

27:23.280 --> 27:26.600
they have because a lot of desktops right now if you don't have internet

27:26.600 --> 27:31.520
access or you've got very unreliable or very expensive internet access a lot of

27:31.520 --> 27:38.440
the stuff that you know regular PCs will do but yeah are not available yeah when

27:38.440 --> 27:42.880
they when the internet goes out which happens from time to time my smartphone

27:42.880 --> 27:47.160
and my PC like I I have it happened recently I sat there Michael and I

27:47.160 --> 27:50.960
thought to myself well what the hell did I do with my computer before I had the

27:50.960 --> 27:54.560
internet like I doubt there was a time mean very long time before I was

27:54.560 --> 27:57.840
regularly connected to the internet and now when it's out I it feels like

27:57.840 --> 28:02.440
everything I can't search I can't reference Wikipedia I can't really pull

28:02.440 --> 28:06.440
down my email it's it feels extremely limited so how does how does endless

28:06.440 --> 28:11.000
address that specifically so there's a couple ways we go about it one is

28:11.000 --> 28:15.280
preloading content like you said you go to Wikipedia a lot but how many pages of

28:15.280 --> 28:20.360
Wikipedia do you actually go and see at any given time you can fit thousands and

28:20.360 --> 28:25.040
thousands of these pages onto a few gigabytes of hard drive space so we'll

28:25.040 --> 28:29.000
preload a whole bunch of Wikipedia content onto the hard drive of these

28:29.000 --> 28:32.640
computers that go out so that all that information is there whether they have

28:32.640 --> 28:36.480
internet access or not and then the second thing that we're working on is

28:36.480 --> 28:44.560
what we call asynchronous internet and that's ways to deliver content in either

28:44.560 --> 28:49.560
times where internet is cheap or when in the brief periods where they are

28:49.560 --> 28:55.160
connected so sort of batching up like updates exactly so like if you've got a

28:55.160 --> 28:59.120
newsreader app or something you've got an app for your local newspaper it

28:59.120 --> 29:02.960
doesn't need to go and download the content every time you open the app it

29:02.960 --> 29:07.640
can go download it overnight and get you you know the next day's stories already

29:07.640 --> 29:12.480
there for you and a lot of the the bandwidth expense in a lot of the areas

29:12.480 --> 29:15.720
of the world that we're targeting is really cheap at night when everybody's

29:15.720 --> 29:20.960
asleep so people can download content when it's cheap use it offline when it's

29:20.960 --> 29:25.160
expensive so why not why not a few apps on top of

29:25.160 --> 29:29.800
Ubuntu why why a whole OS why why a complete solution because it feels like

29:29.800 --> 29:32.720
it's more than just a desktop it feels like it's a whole integrated product and

29:32.720 --> 29:39.880
solution it is it's actually it's built off of OS tree and flat packs oh okay

29:39.880 --> 29:45.280
so the OS image is delivered through OS tree we can do transactional updates of

29:45.280 --> 29:50.640
that and then you add apps to it via flat packs from GNOME software that's

29:50.640 --> 29:55.440
some edge that's some cutting-edge stuff there yep and you know part of what

29:55.440 --> 30:00.560
we're doing is we're working on a way now where you can load apps or OS

30:00.560 --> 30:06.280
updates or even like application content updates onto a USB stick from a computer

30:06.280 --> 30:09.720
that has internet access and then take it to a whole bunch of these computers

30:09.720 --> 30:13.800
that don't have it and they can use what's on that USB stick just like they

30:13.800 --> 30:17.560
would connecting to a remote server so they can get their OS updates they can

30:17.560 --> 30:22.360
install applications they can refresh you know their news app whatever hmm and

30:22.360 --> 30:30.600
so are they are they focused it's only on like the the markets that have like

30:30.600 --> 30:34.840
occasional internet and and things like that or are they looking at also the

30:34.840 --> 30:41.360
broader Linux desktop market that is the the specific market and it's kind of a

30:41.360 --> 30:45.720
vague definition because it's not just like you know in Africa or parts of South

30:45.720 --> 30:51.560
America but there's work being done right now in prison systems where those

30:51.560 --> 30:55.160
computers are not connected to the internet ever for obvious reasons sure

30:55.160 --> 30:59.080
but they still need a way to put updates on there get new content on there make

30:59.080 --> 31:02.960
them useful without putting them actually on the internet absolutely gosh

31:02.960 --> 31:06.720
that may avoid there must be there must be so many use cases for that and

31:06.720 --> 31:11.720
there's really nobody that's rushing to fill that void because everybody wants

31:11.720 --> 31:16.120
to integrate their OS is with their cloud product exactly but you know a lot

31:16.120 --> 31:19.120
of these technologies that you were just talking about with flat pack and you

31:19.120 --> 31:22.700
know like see async and everything they're all again make it easier to do

31:22.700 --> 31:28.200
all of this offline or asynchronously so why um why also hardware because it's

31:28.200 --> 31:34.280
pretty unique stuff it's got a unique look a unique design is this is this

31:34.280 --> 31:38.040
part of the we don't just give out an image but is this part of the whole it's

31:38.040 --> 31:43.200
one product thing so that to give it a little bit of history the the original

31:43.200 --> 31:46.720
attempt that the company made was to use mobile hardware like tablets or phones

31:46.720 --> 31:51.640
oh interesting they were gonna have them plug into a TV for a monitor you know

31:51.640 --> 31:55.760
you might call like a convergence type experience yeah similar to what you know

31:55.760 --> 32:00.200
a bunch of was going for but that that wasn't working out for them and they

32:00.200 --> 32:05.280
tried some variations on that before settling on actually doing a desktop OS

32:05.280 --> 32:11.640
based on Linux so once they started getting the the OS going they needed a

32:11.640 --> 32:15.840
way to actually put this OS out there and give it a run make sure it works

32:15.840 --> 32:20.160
show investors that it works so they did this line of hardware they did the

32:20.160 --> 32:24.600
mission mini the mission one a couple others the devices that you've probably

32:24.600 --> 32:31.240
seen the little white yeah which did their job of letting the company test

32:31.240 --> 32:36.800
the OS in these markets with hardware that they knew it would work on since

32:36.800 --> 32:41.320
then though they've been partnering with a sir and ASUS and HP and now those though

32:41.320 --> 32:45.180
we I'm sorry the ones who are making hardware with endless OS running on it

32:45.180 --> 32:52.280
and putting that out into those market no kidding so we're in Brazil and Mexico

32:52.280 --> 32:57.360
and Guatemala right now and we are just about to launch in Indonesia wow

32:57.360 --> 33:01.680
congratulations that's really great and so I guess as part of this growth they

33:01.680 --> 33:06.600
brought you on and are you are you on there as is your official role like Lord

33:06.600 --> 33:11.320
and dictator of endless or where do they fit you in there same role that I had at

33:11.320 --> 33:15.080
canonical actually I'm a community manager and going to be working on

33:15.080 --> 33:20.720
growing their community and helping the the users get in touch with the company

33:20.720 --> 33:24.360
make sure we're getting good feedback into the company and vice versa cool so

33:24.360 --> 33:29.560
I guess what excites me about endless is first of all brilliant idea seems like

33:29.560 --> 33:33.560
that's a pretty good market to go after because even outside of developing

33:33.560 --> 33:39.180
nations there is a lot of installations just in the West that sounds like they

33:39.180 --> 33:43.080
could benefit from a system that's intentionally designed to be offline with

33:43.080 --> 33:46.840
ways to update it via thumb drives and whatnot that's just I love all of it so

33:46.840 --> 33:50.240
it to me when I heard this and thanks for filling in some of the gaps to me

33:50.240 --> 33:53.840
the reason why I thought this is gonna be great for gnome was now you have a

33:53.840 --> 34:00.080
company who's who's gonna have who's gonna have something based on gnome in

34:00.080 --> 34:04.640
front of a lot of users that are truly that quote-unquote new user people that

34:04.640 --> 34:07.560
really expect different things from their computer like it's gonna bring in

34:07.560 --> 34:11.640
a whole new set of of users that are gonna drive finding more bugs they're

34:11.640 --> 34:15.120
gonna drive future upstream development of gnome like I think that even more

34:15.120 --> 34:18.280
deployments are going to increase the eyes on the bugs in the code like all

34:18.280 --> 34:21.160
these things are going to stack up but what are some other ways that endless is

34:21.160 --> 34:24.760
involved with the gnome project outside of just what seemed to me to be obvious

34:24.760 --> 34:31.680
benefits so I mentioned flat hub already one of the endless employees Rob McQueen

34:31.680 --> 34:35.240
is the one who's getting that set up he did the crowdfunding that you mentioned

34:35.240 --> 34:40.120
and endless is already planning on shipping flat hub enabled by default in

34:40.120 --> 34:45.400
future versions so that people who want to put apps available to endless users

34:45.400 --> 34:48.760
submit them to flat hub they're automatically going to be available

34:48.760 --> 34:55.040
that's awesome and that that is a just that would be great for hall clinics in

34:55.040 --> 34:59.000
general really is just getting just getting a universal package format more

34:59.000 --> 35:03.080
accepted and why flat packs and you know the history and the decision there was

35:03.080 --> 35:06.840
it just because it's the whole gnome ecosystem I don't know the history of it

35:06.840 --> 35:10.360
I think it's because there were a bunch of known people that started the

35:10.360 --> 35:14.320
original engineering around this that's what was there at the start it was

35:14.320 --> 35:17.920
available it worked so they went with it can you fill in any details around that

35:17.920 --> 35:20.040
because that was the other thing I remember hearing about endless is that

35:20.040 --> 35:25.120
there was some known people behind it right so I don't know all of them but I

35:25.120 --> 35:30.960
know cosimo who I think he's been on your show before I'm not I can't

35:30.960 --> 35:39.080
remember he's been on some show cosimo cos it yes yes the gnome director is an

35:39.080 --> 35:44.080
engineer here at endless yeah it was Linux action show ages ago I think yeah

35:44.080 --> 35:48.640
and I know we've got some others too I just don't know who's yeah I'm still

35:48.640 --> 35:51.320
yeah I've been here for less than a month now so I'm still learning

35:51.320 --> 35:55.240
everybody and what their past connections were so what are so what are

35:55.240 --> 35:59.040
some of the secret future projects that you can you can tell us about and then

35:59.040 --> 36:02.200
blame on the fact that you were new to the gig and didn't understand all the

36:02.200 --> 36:07.840
rules like give us like give us a hint so if you go to community dot endless m

36:07.840 --> 36:13.400
comm I'm gonna start posting some kind of teaser videos about what's coming in

36:13.400 --> 36:18.160
the next version so endless 3.2 has got some really big changes we fell behind

36:18.160 --> 36:22.960
in our sync with gnome so we were a few versions behind that's being caught back

36:22.960 --> 36:29.020
up a lot of new flat pack improvements have landed a lot of OS and shell

36:29.020 --> 36:32.840
changes have landed that makes it a lot better so I'm gonna start dropping some

36:32.840 --> 36:35.840
short little videos showing off the changes you can check them out there

36:35.840 --> 36:41.060
that's our forum site community dot endless m comm awesome I will link that

36:41.060 --> 36:44.280
in the show notes to to make it easy for anybody that wants to lazy web that link

36:44.280 --> 36:48.520
it looks like that's a that's a pretty cool resource so if I was if I was

36:48.520 --> 36:52.320
looking to switch distros is this something that would be in is this

36:52.320 --> 36:55.040
something you say yeah Chris is a long time desktop Linux user I think you

36:55.040 --> 36:59.720
should give this a consideration or is it more for totally new users who are

36:59.720 --> 37:04.520
coming into Linux and and want something just just something that's more met for

37:04.520 --> 37:09.440
their expectations I would tell you to give it a try but if you're like a

37:09.440 --> 37:13.720
hardcore tinkerer you're probably not gonna like the fact that it's got this

37:13.720 --> 37:19.080
read-only OS tree system image oh interesting but you know if you've got

37:19.080 --> 37:23.600
you know like a guest computer or something anywhere you've got Chrome OS

37:23.600 --> 37:27.400
being run it would be a great replacement for that I actually just

37:27.400 --> 37:32.160
gave I gave a laptop with it to my grandmother to let her try it out

37:32.160 --> 37:40.440
because her windows well she's only had it for a little while now she played a

37:40.440 --> 37:45.560
lot of online games so that's been some issues with flash but I put Chrome on

37:45.560 --> 37:49.620
there and that seemed to have helped stuff I love it but he makes got some

37:49.620 --> 37:52.840
some tough questions for you Michael see if you've managed to grok this stuff yet

37:52.840 --> 37:59.200
go ahead mini yeah Michael do you have some upgrade priorities for your system

37:59.200 --> 38:04.680
I imagine if you have bad internet so let's say you have priority call bug

38:04.680 --> 38:13.920
fixes and other bug fixes and then at the end only application updates I don't

38:13.920 --> 38:18.080
know yet I know the whole offline upgrade with a USB stick is still being

38:18.080 --> 38:24.560
developed and I would imagine it uses just OS tree images so like the kernel

38:24.560 --> 38:30.120
and the system libraries and stuff would all be in one update but if you have

38:30.120 --> 38:35.240
some if you have normal online connectivity could the system just

38:35.240 --> 38:41.180
decide okay I have online connectivity I have new kernels first I do a kernel

38:41.180 --> 38:48.560
update if I have a connection I continue with the upgrades oh like like the like

38:48.560 --> 38:52.640
the oh wow oh that is a neat idea so the update system itself says okay well now

38:52.640 --> 38:56.240
that I've got a moment of data these are the most high priority but you know what

38:56.240 --> 38:58.920
would be tricky about that is you also have to figure out dependency resolution

38:58.920 --> 39:14.280
somehow right in fact so the OS tree models like it's like getting that it

39:14.280 --> 39:18.520
has checksums for individual files right so you can check to make sure every

39:18.520 --> 39:21.760
files legit so if there's a bad file you can you could abort the update so that's

39:21.760 --> 39:26.080
pretty solid so you have a good chance the updates gonna work and it uses hard

39:26.080 --> 39:31.440
links I think so I'm rough on my understanding but the OS tree is like

39:31.440 --> 39:35.480
sort of it does the entire thing in one go and then it goes through and does a

39:35.480 --> 39:38.520
full check of all the files to make sure that everything is solid and that there

39:38.520 --> 39:41.480
aren't any corrupt files and then it flips the bit and says this is now the

39:41.480 --> 39:46.100
live file system that kind of right and I think it keeps that old one around too

39:46.100 --> 39:49.960
so if you go to reboot and something's wrong you just flip back to that old set

39:49.960 --> 39:52.840
right which is sort of going back to what Lenart was saying like here's a

39:52.840 --> 39:56.120
different way to do it Lenart's has CA sync now which is totally different thing

39:56.120 --> 39:58.720
which I'm sure we'll learn more about in the future but this is another way to

39:58.720 --> 40:04.280
deliver this feature set so sounds like maybe CA sync is going to deliver these

40:04.280 --> 40:08.440
differences to OS tree images maybe I don't know I'll have to look more into

40:08.440 --> 40:13.720
that interesting hmm so you do you do you I guess I want to make sure I

40:13.720 --> 40:18.120
understand the the your answer to the hardware stuff sounds like sort of the

40:18.120 --> 40:21.880
implication and your answer was is that endless might pull back a bit from

40:21.880 --> 40:25.400
producing hardware now that they kind of have some momentum going and feature

40:25.400 --> 40:29.160
more so it sounds like you're gonna focus more on working with upstream OEMs

40:29.160 --> 40:33.280
did I did I just grok that yeah yeah I mean we don't we don't want to be the

40:33.280 --> 40:37.240
hardware provider for endless OS that was a way to bootstrap things to get it

40:37.240 --> 40:41.240
out into the market but we really want to work with hardware partners to get it

40:41.240 --> 40:44.440
out there oh okay all right well you know what that seems to make a lot of

40:44.440 --> 40:49.880
sense like I'm really excited about just something just something really focused

40:49.880 --> 40:55.400
on that market focused on on it's so refreshing to hear here's somebody that's

40:55.400 --> 40:58.080
building something that's not all about integrating their cloud solution and

40:58.080 --> 41:03.040
it's more about building a system for people where they could be offline for

41:03.040 --> 41:05.920
long periods of time because that happens to me quite a bit and it's gonna

41:05.920 --> 41:09.640
happen to me in in in about a month I'll be offline for a large period of time

41:09.640 --> 41:12.560
and so it'd be a great time to give something like endless a spin so I'm

41:12.560 --> 41:19.080
considering throwing it on a on an XPS how's the high dpi support um I don't

41:19.080 --> 41:22.880
actually have a high dpi monitor to test it on so I'm not sure I might give it a

41:22.880 --> 41:27.000
go it's a gnome shell so yeah yeah you know and you got all that fractional

41:27.000 --> 41:32.440
scaling well played sir well played well Michael is there anything else you want

41:32.440 --> 41:36.440
to mention or tell us about endless before yeah if you want to get it the

41:36.440 --> 41:42.200
the latest stable version is available at endless OS comm slash download we're

41:42.200 --> 41:45.680
pushing bit torrent so if you could help us out by seeding it that would be

41:45.680 --> 41:49.760
awesome we'd love you for it very good and then keep an eye out in about a

41:49.760 --> 41:54.320
month the next major version should be coming out oh very well we will keep our

41:54.320 --> 41:57.420
ear to the ground and I keep everybody updated and feel free to join us in the

41:57.420 --> 42:00.920
future and tell us what's going on with the project I'm I'm excited I'm really

42:00.920 --> 42:04.400
excited by it look forward to it yeah give it a try I want to see what you

42:04.400 --> 42:09.120
think okay I might just time it perfectly with my offline trip and we

42:09.120 --> 42:13.480
will report back now I before we go I wanted to just mention also really

42:13.480 --> 42:18.440
quickly another bit of community news just sort of a quick aside our friends

42:18.440 --> 42:24.400
over at elementary OS have announced their move over to github oh there he is

42:24.400 --> 42:31.520
ladies and gentlemen mr. West Payne hello I'm late no problem been holding

42:31.520 --> 42:34.240
the fort down though it's been an awkward show but now that you're back

42:34.240 --> 42:37.880
everything's right so I just think I just mentioned that really quickly

42:37.880 --> 42:41.320
because I think that's gonna be great for elementary OS yeah hopefully that

42:41.320 --> 42:44.520
makes it easy to people to contribute exactly you get more people in there

42:44.520 --> 42:48.720
it's exactly that's exactly what I was thinking you read my mind mr. West you

42:48.720 --> 42:52.720
know what let's take a moment and thank ting go to linux.ting.com to sign up and

42:52.720 --> 42:56.520
get $25 off a device if you want to grab one directly or if you bring one and

42:56.520 --> 42:59.760
they have a CD main and they got a GSM network so you might just want to bring

42:59.760 --> 43:04.400
one check out their BYOD page if you bring it you get $25 in service credit

43:04.400 --> 43:09.200
son I'll tell you what girl it's $23 per phone per month on average for a ting

43:09.200 --> 43:13.880
customer so you see why that $25 credits nice it's really simple in fact it's

43:13.880 --> 43:17.520
it's the way mobile would work a lot of times outside the states my audience

43:17.520 --> 43:22.000
tells me you mean this isn't how you guys do it it's it's obvious it's so

43:22.000 --> 43:24.840
simple and obvious I guess it took two cows to figure it out and they launched

43:24.840 --> 43:29.040
ting and now they have a simple smart way to do mobile you just pay for what

43:29.040 --> 43:36.000
you use $6 for each line so if you want one line at $6 a month if you want two

43:36.000 --> 43:40.320
lines at $6 a month if you got a phone that you occasionally use that's a

43:40.320 --> 43:43.240
really really nice thing because you can have your main line like I do and then

43:43.240 --> 43:46.680
you can have a standby line that's only six dollars if you don't use anything on

43:46.680 --> 43:49.320
it and when you do need it you just pay for what you use your minutes your

43:49.320 --> 43:53.520
messages your megabytes it's all clearly laid out on ting's website there's no

43:53.520 --> 43:57.680
hidden charges or surprises you get a great dashboard to manage it incredible

43:57.680 --> 44:01.920
customer service all the stuff you'd expect with a standard plan nationwide

44:01.920 --> 44:06.400
coverage no contracts you can see your usage at a glance so you're on top of it

44:06.400 --> 44:10.120
all the time bring a device or grab one from ting like check this one out Wes I

44:10.120 --> 44:14.080
gotta scoot up here for this guy scoot up gotta get in get I gonna get yeah I

44:14.080 --> 44:20.920
gotta zoom in here zoom in enhance this is the ANS h450r say that again the ANS

44:20.920 --> 44:30.320
h450r Wes I'm sure you've heard of it right you might notice it's a it's it's

44:30.320 --> 44:33.880
a bit rugged look I was gonna say it quite handsome it's rugged yeah it

44:33.880 --> 44:38.800
looks like the fridge that Harrison Ford jumped in to survive yes you get it so

44:38.800 --> 44:43.280
this is I bring this up because this son-of-a-gun is in the sub 70 market

44:43.280 --> 44:49.200
when you use our code oh yeah go to linux.ting.com $65 Android phone now you

44:49.200 --> 44:54.000
know it's not gonna be the S8 here it's not got the it doesn't have like the eye

44:54.000 --> 44:57.600
tracking it does look like I could drop it and have a decent chance of not

44:57.600 --> 45:01.960
scratch that is ruining yes that is exactly you get an Android 5.1 device

45:01.960 --> 45:07.120
with a quad-core 1.3 gigahertz processor that does stand that could stand a nuke

45:07.120 --> 45:12.000
test it's got Corning Gorilla Glass display that takes a punch it's got wet

45:12.000 --> 45:16.040
touch technology yes you can laugh at a maniac during rainstorms while you're

45:16.040 --> 45:20.680
using your phone like a boost yeah it's also apparently dust resistant

45:20.680 --> 45:24.880
waterproof dust proof and get ready for this West is why I picked it for you

45:24.880 --> 45:30.280
shockproof oh perfect yeah you're not getting it for its 2 megapixel front

45:30.280 --> 45:33.360
facing camera though that is not but you know that's gonna catch you when you're

45:33.360 --> 45:37.640
jumping out maybe I really prefer the lo-fi selfies yeah exactly yeah it's

45:37.640 --> 45:41.600
like a learning that much it's retro yeah it's like a 70s so you can get it

45:41.600 --> 45:46.520
with like you know 8 gigs or whatever internal but here's the thing West micro

45:46.520 --> 45:50.720
SD and the son of a gun and if that okay if this wasn't enough for this truck

45:50.720 --> 45:55.600
size Cadillac get this the son of a gun has a 2 sim slot well guess what guess

45:55.600 --> 46:00.880
what that's pretty handy I don't know why does it have CD man GSM antennas in

46:00.880 --> 46:08.720
it let me see no I just think it has CDMA all right no I mean I think it just

46:08.720 --> 46:12.360
has GSM so I don't know why you would want two Sims it's a good question

46:12.360 --> 46:18.360
maybe one goes bad on you it's like eyes it's like your eyeballs or your ears who

46:18.360 --> 46:21.920
is better than somehow I'm sure Noah could tell us why we want want to he

46:21.920 --> 46:25.880
probably has to yeah you're right he probably could Linux dot ting calm

46:25.880 --> 46:28.480
that's where you go to get started you could go get yourself Cadillac phone

46:28.480 --> 46:32.080
maybe just go get yourself that phone I mean I'm not judging to be honest with

46:32.080 --> 46:37.640
you I'm not judging you I'm jealous I'm super jealous so we have ourselves a

46:37.640 --> 46:40.000
barbecue coming up I should probably mention really quick because it's

46:40.000 --> 46:44.800
getting not next week but the week after the 4th of July America's birthday go to

46:44.800 --> 46:47.880
meetup calm slash Jupiter broadcasting if you're anywhere in the Pacific

46:47.880 --> 46:52.560
Northwest if you're within I'd say six hours you should come because seeing

46:52.560 --> 46:59.440
West's in a skirts worth it alone I would say I mean they usually on show

46:59.440 --> 47:02.560
days wear skirts that's true yeah cuz you know we have to cut it off at the

47:02.560 --> 47:05.320
table now I won't even now I'm not pretending like I'm not wearing a skirt

47:05.320 --> 47:08.520
cuz I'm just not wearing any pants so if you want to see that yeah it's warm in

47:08.520 --> 47:12.440
the studio it really does there's a lot of equipment and you want some flow you

47:12.440 --> 47:15.280
do yeah you need otherwise you're getting distracted and if you're

47:15.280 --> 47:18.360
thinking about other things you can't do a good show so meetup calm slash

47:18.360 --> 47:23.880
Jupiter broadcasting that we'd really like to have you join us hang out maybe

47:23.880 --> 47:28.360
help my chair does this squeak on you during text nap like this or is it just

47:28.360 --> 47:31.320
do I just move around more than you do I mean it does squeak I think the latter

47:31.320 --> 47:34.880
yeah yeah I do I'm conscious that it's it's funny cuz I'm not on camera I'm

47:34.880 --> 47:37.240
just sitting here I could just sit here like a lump but instead I'm like moving

47:37.240 --> 47:41.280
around constantly meetup calm slash Jupiter broadcasting I don't know what's

47:41.280 --> 47:44.380
happening other than we're gonna be cooking a lot we're gonna be hanging out

47:44.380 --> 47:48.520
I wonder if we'll have the VR set up or if we can enlist somebody set up the VR

47:48.520 --> 47:52.160
we could have the VR go and that could be pretty fun and then we're gonna do

47:52.160 --> 47:54.920
Linux unplug live we're gonna invite everybody to stay and hang out with us

47:54.920 --> 47:59.360
and we'll have it going on the TV in the living room and we also have a couple of

47:59.360 --> 48:03.240
chairs here in studio so if we get a couple of brave souls who might want to

48:03.240 --> 48:06.720
go from a virtual lug member to an actual physical take it to the next

48:06.720 --> 48:11.000
level right so meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting if you can make it just so

48:11.000 --> 48:15.040
we kind of know how many people are coming as we can plan food wise and then

48:15.040 --> 48:19.240
we probably are gonna stream it somehow I mean if nothing else we'll have the

48:19.240 --> 48:22.800
studio cameras on who love the mics open so people come in and talk to the chat

48:22.800 --> 48:26.920
room and I don't know they will have like a barbecue cam or something it could

48:26.920 --> 48:29.520
be a lot of fun so it's we're gonna celebrate episode 200 of the unplugged

48:29.520 --> 48:33.000
program there we go I got that out of my system I feel like we can do the show

48:33.000 --> 48:37.880
now breathing room it was do you see that do you see that box behind you do

48:37.880 --> 48:42.440
you see that there's a box back there is a box what's in that box these started

48:42.440 --> 48:48.000
showing up around the around the around the web and they are they're hand

48:48.000 --> 48:53.520
painted I believe tux mass sort of like a guy Fox mass but it's a guy this is

48:53.520 --> 48:59.880
adorable isn't that pretty cool it's a system 76 been sending out these these

48:59.880 --> 49:03.160
guys here I'll turn on do I have the do we have studio cam yeah there we do it's

49:03.160 --> 49:05.760
not a very clear picture but here you can kind of see if you're watching the

49:05.760 --> 49:08.760
video version you can kind of see the guy tux mask here and it comes in a

49:08.760 --> 49:12.440
nice envelope with a wax stamp straps right to your face and so they have they

49:12.440 --> 49:14.880
have quite a big they're making something something's going on there's

49:14.880 --> 49:17.760
like a hashtag involved and there's a I also notice on the website there's a

49:17.760 --> 49:23.560
countdown going on so I suspect if you go to the system 76 calm website and

49:23.560 --> 49:27.120
look around for their revolution or look so it's either revolution of 76 or

49:27.120 --> 49:31.200
hashtag revolution revolutionist 76 if you're on Twitter I think there's

49:31.200 --> 49:34.480
probably some sales coming down the road but they're making look at this I don't

49:34.480 --> 49:38.080
know what it is it could be something bigger though because I mean at first I

49:38.080 --> 49:42.480
thought okay it's gonna be a big sale but then they start talking about the

49:42.480 --> 49:45.520
people have forgotten what real freedom means to have the possibility of

49:45.520 --> 49:49.520
attaining anything you can imagine rather than allowing limits to define

49:49.520 --> 49:52.520
your greatest potential don't like to allow limits to define my potential

49:52.520 --> 49:58.840
that's true on June 27th which is soon hashtag revolution is 76 commences for

49:58.840 --> 50:02.960
which I have a grand surprise in store for our community this shall be the day

50:02.960 --> 50:06.960
the day that we reveal to the world a global society of creators today we will

50:06.960 --> 50:10.880
remind the people how to access freedom from surveillance from limitations from

50:10.880 --> 50:19.280
restrictions so I so I don't know I don't know what this means access to

50:19.280 --> 50:21.720
freedom sounds good though yeah so I don't know it could be at first I was

50:21.720 --> 50:24.320
like well this sounds like open hardware almost like maybe they're gonna launch

50:24.320 --> 50:27.000
does that was that what you were thinking something like that but it also

50:27.000 --> 50:30.560
could just be a sale it could just be a sale I think it does go to show that

50:30.560 --> 50:35.480
those system 76 keyboards the caps lock key definitely works it's very effective

50:35.480 --> 50:46.120
yeah that smooth travel yeah that is a takeaway you can make and there's also

50:46.120 --> 50:49.520
it's happening here in the tweet to look see see there's a lot of there's a lot

50:49.520 --> 50:52.360
of caps in that tweet there too well what it feels that good why not you

50:52.360 --> 50:56.400
pretty pumped up yeah hey so if you want to play with the it's pretty nice see oh

50:56.400 --> 51:00.920
and then they have a website inside the mask open source revolution org let's go

51:00.920 --> 51:05.920
there let's see what that open source revolution you know I'm having a hard

51:05.920 --> 51:10.480
time typing today is a weird you're not wearing your mask it's because I all

51:10.480 --> 51:14.680
they've had today is a is of is a smoothie oh it just goes to the website

51:14.680 --> 51:19.360
I was already alright so you can go to if you want to check it out and so you

51:19.360 --> 51:22.480
know you people people always say like oh let me put my sys admin hat on now

51:22.480 --> 51:25.960
you can put your sys admin mask on yeah and you're ready to do some do some

51:25.960 --> 51:31.200
penguin eating right all right do you think it would look good it might

51:31.440 --> 51:34.800
the smells alright so I could wear that it's kind of loud though when we set

51:34.800 --> 51:40.000
around on the table you know I mean it's not a good show prop yeah it'd be good

51:40.000 --> 51:42.880
if this was more if we had a camera if we had a camera straight on to us but

51:42.880 --> 51:46.280
anyways yeah so you can we'll have a link in the actually I hopefully I'll

51:46.280 --> 51:51.640
have the image embedded if you want to see it in the show notes so duder linux

51:51.640 --> 51:56.240
says that there's going they're gonna be launching new cases and stuff wow oh my

51:56.240 --> 52:01.000
god West holy crap that was freaky man hello I'm gonna take a picture I just I

52:01.000 --> 52:04.640
just I just turned over and Wes was wearing the mask I looked over at Wes

52:04.640 --> 52:12.520
and he's wearing the mask and I I just about had a heart attack that is uh I'm

52:12.520 --> 52:14.720
gonna tweet that so people can see what I'm talking about cuz that is some

52:14.720 --> 52:18.520
creepy stuff yeah so duder says that he says that they're gonna be launching new

52:18.520 --> 52:23.160
cases and stuff that could be it I'd like to see something I mean there's a

52:23.160 --> 52:26.360
yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of there's a lot of caps and there's a lot

52:26.360 --> 52:28.960
of promotion for freedom and open source so we'll see what's we'll see what it

52:28.960 --> 52:32.800
comes out to be anyway so I'll post that later cuz I'm getting distracted by it I

52:32.800 --> 52:35.880
wanted to cover something that I think is just really important anybody who

52:35.880 --> 52:43.080
likes minecraft or and like in my case is a parent of a minecraft user two of

52:43.080 --> 52:49.080
them as a matter of fact minecraft is going to this new back end this new

52:49.080 --> 52:55.480
fancy bedrock back end that's gonna be a common core for minecraft on Windows 10

52:55.480 --> 53:00.800
minecraft on Xbox and Android and console versions like that and tablets

53:00.800 --> 53:07.880
and there is currently no back end for the Linux what yeah and there currently

53:07.880 --> 53:12.080
is a they drop in Java yes exactly they're moving away now they're gonna

53:12.080 --> 53:15.200
can't they're gonna maintain the Java version so it's not like Java the Java

53:15.200 --> 53:18.480
versions going away forever but the issue is that if you want to if you want

53:18.480 --> 53:22.680
to multi-play or if you want to download any of the new texture packs or any of

53:22.680 --> 53:28.400
the new levels or skins you have to be in this new back end I see so if you

53:28.400 --> 53:31.120
want it's the Java users will probably just be able to keep playing amongst

53:31.120 --> 53:35.160
each other forever and I just never get any of the new cool stuff yeah my yeah

53:35.160 --> 53:38.520
exactly my son Dylan says he's fine with that but I have it see what I'm worried

53:38.520 --> 53:42.600
about is this eventually leads to dad I want Windows 10 and then that's this is

53:42.600 --> 53:46.680
this we cannot have so they have this feedback dot minecraft dot net site where

53:46.680 --> 53:54.240
there is currently a petition yes I know it's a petition there's currently a

53:54.240 --> 54:01.320
petition going on for Linux support and it also is for Mac support but there

54:01.320 --> 54:05.440
are more like radical approaches kidnapping developers children it's just

54:05.440 --> 54:10.600
these petitions so so often fail to work because the developers themselves bring

54:10.600 --> 54:17.120
in a certain bias to the market so this guy his name is mojang to toto MMO and

54:17.120 --> 54:21.960
he's got a Windows icon you know he's got mojang in front of his name and he's

54:21.960 --> 54:27.360
responding on the reddit post about this feedback thread and he says he talks in

54:27.360 --> 54:30.680
here he says well one of the reasons we're not shipping for Linux is there's

54:30.680 --> 54:35.840
there's no store there's no Xbox Live but they probably just have to build that

54:35.840 --> 54:40.320
in there's no update mechanism for closed-source stuff so you would need to

54:40.320 --> 54:44.320
make our own store and then we'd have to sell the launcher there and it's just a

54:44.320 --> 54:48.800
massive amount of work for us and probably more than just porting issues

54:48.800 --> 54:55.400
so he's saying the reason why one of the most highly played games in history

54:55.400 --> 54:59.240
isn't getting ported to Linux is because they can't figure out a way to ship it

54:59.240 --> 55:05.440
for Linux is what he's saying yeah ouch I would like I would like somebody to

55:05.440 --> 55:13.000
tell him about flat packs and snap packages and app images yeah and then of

55:13.000 --> 55:17.800
course they so somebody says what about using the distro third-party repositories

55:17.800 --> 55:21.480
Google does this for Chrome and Debian you could set up your own repo and then

55:21.480 --> 55:24.820
send updates that way and he says but how do you plug that into a store so

55:24.820 --> 55:27.880
then people can buy it and if they don't buy it they don't get it you can't use

55:27.880 --> 55:31.800
repo for paid updates out of the box also each distro can choose different

55:31.800 --> 55:35.320
package managers so instead of one you have to support two and a lot more than

55:35.320 --> 55:39.600
that really or go steam which is gonna be unlikely for Microsoft yeah that's

55:39.600 --> 55:43.240
that part which is he totally acknowledges in this post he says I

55:43.240 --> 55:46.180
ported a game to Linux before and the fragmentation of the and the

55:46.180 --> 55:49.660
non-existence of the ecosystem makes Linux easily the most expensive platform

55:49.660 --> 55:53.600
to support for developers which crossed them which crossed with minimal sales

55:53.600 --> 55:57.740
makes it a really tough idea actually getting the game to run is almost the

55:57.740 --> 56:00.720
easiest part and we're already there because they got working on Android to

56:00.720 --> 56:05.040
the game I've ported sold something like 56 copies in the first month on Linux

56:05.040 --> 56:10.120
this guy's a mojang a place everything theory or a former mojang employee he

56:10.120 --> 56:13.600
might be an MS employee now I'm not sure but the anyways we'll have the thread

56:13.600 --> 56:16.480
all that linked in the show notes if you would like to see it ported maybe it's

56:16.480 --> 56:20.840
worth throwing in there because if it gets enough attention they'll learn

56:20.840 --> 56:24.360
about ways to distribute software on Linux it's a solvable problem it's

56:24.360 --> 56:29.200
actually problem we've already solved so I would love to see that because man

56:29.200 --> 56:35.220
wouldn't it suck if Linux missed out on one of the most important games simply

56:35.220 --> 56:41.920
because it was too freaking hard to figure out how to ship software on it

56:41.920 --> 56:45.160
especially for you for so long when people were running like Minecraft

56:45.160 --> 56:48.240
servers on Linux and I mean you know it feels like there's been we've kind of

56:48.240 --> 56:51.520
been at least somewhat connected to it or it's been a part of our community or

56:51.520 --> 56:55.800
at least on the edges of it for so long yeah architect points out I'm gonna I'm

56:55.800 --> 56:58.160
gonna do this respond to this because they probably get this in the comments

56:58.160 --> 57:01.280
to architect points out well you know Chris you could run you could run the

57:01.280 --> 57:06.200
new bedrock or whatever it's called version in in wine you know maybe

57:06.200 --> 57:10.440
crossover will build a build a nice easy installer and put in a bottle but the

57:10.440 --> 57:15.560
the thing is is like my kids and all of my kids friends aren't gonna install

57:15.560 --> 57:18.840
Linux to then install wine to then install Minecraft the might see the

57:18.840 --> 57:21.760
thing is is right now there's the and this is kind of what this is what muddies

57:21.760 --> 57:26.520
the water is there is a quote-unquote Minecraft launcher which is kind of

57:26.520 --> 57:32.360
recent might still actually be in beta and is native and available for Linux

57:32.360 --> 57:37.320
this is a native Minecraft launcher for Linux and that's been available for a

57:37.320 --> 57:41.820
while now and then there's this new bedrock core version of Minecraft which

57:41.820 --> 57:46.400
is only at present in terms of desktop computers available for Windows 10 there

57:46.400 --> 57:52.960
is a port like a small educational version that they have forked off that

57:52.960 --> 57:56.120
is available for Mac OS that is also based on the bedrock core there is

57:56.120 --> 58:01.220
nothing for Linux and that's really depressing so links in the show notes

58:01.220 --> 58:05.360
I'm gonna I'm gonna try to get in there I'm gonna try to pass around this

58:05.360 --> 58:09.960
information to folks and maybe get the folks over there in touch with people

58:09.960 --> 58:13.480
that know more about how to package up software deliver it and maybe get them

58:13.480 --> 58:16.720
communicating with the folks that are developing the new Minecraft version so

58:16.720 --> 58:22.080
that way they can get educated on what's available maybe we can help them so we

58:22.080 --> 58:24.680
are working on it already behind the scenes it is tough though when you kind

58:24.680 --> 58:28.640
of you you know you're relying on you know other games bigger games or things

58:28.640 --> 58:33.040
where you weren't so assuming that there would be the store infrastructure you

58:33.040 --> 58:36.800
know like a lot of games they'll just do it in game or that kind of thing it's

58:36.800 --> 58:39.720
tough when we don't you know we have kind of those but we don't have great

58:39.720 --> 58:44.560
set of primitives for hey here's your private DRM paywalled app it's just not

58:44.560 --> 58:48.560
yeah yeah yeah yeah and it's one of those things where like the old version

58:48.560 --> 58:52.960
is not gonna die necessarily so maybe it'll be just fine for a while but you

58:52.960 --> 58:58.480
don't also want to be on the road yeah yeah there's yeah there's always there's

58:58.480 --> 59:02.520
always the possibility that mine test could take off yeah well GB mine test

59:02.520 --> 59:08.400
server that's what you're saying no I don't think late at the barbecue I don't

59:08.400 --> 59:13.480
think so man you know I got you know I you know what I gotta do I gotta quit

59:13.480 --> 59:17.120
playing video games takes up a lot of time but just never I never I never have

59:17.120 --> 59:21.000
time for for anything because I'm just playing all these little race the Sun

59:21.000 --> 59:24.480
here and there okay you're right just to wake up with okay you're right okay I

59:24.480 --> 59:27.280
was teasing I I don't actually play video but I you're right I do play some

59:27.280 --> 59:30.800
race the Sun from time to time you know what I you know what I would do if I had

59:30.800 --> 59:37.380
some spare spare time I would lay seeds in my mind and I would then pour stinky

59:37.380 --> 59:42.120
stinky fertilizer over those seeds I would then water it and maybe every now

59:42.120 --> 59:47.120
and then splash in a dash of coffee grinds have you heard this coffee grinds

59:47.120 --> 59:52.000
in your garden have you heard oh yeah sure you have uh-huh yeah I haven't done

59:52.000 --> 59:56.320
it but I've done it don't do too much did you grow me some more coffee no I

59:56.320 --> 01:00:00.140
grew tomatoes but this is supposed to be an analogy about your mind Linux

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:05.440
Academy comm slash unplugged see I was I was I got off on the I'm being excited

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.400
about coffee but the thing is is you could lay the seeds for your mind and

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.720
then Linux Academy that's the fertilizer you go in there you get some self-paced

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:17.320
in-depth video courses on every single Linux cloud DevOps topic the big stuff

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:23.320
too like Azure and AWS and your open stacks and oh my goodness oh my goodness

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:26.360
if you didn't if you don't have all of the basics of networking don't feel like

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.160
you're don't don't don't feel bad don't sit there and hide it from everybody

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.040
don't keep it your big secret just go to Linux Academy they got great courses all

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:38.040
that stuff hands-on scenario based labs to give you experience on real servers

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.960
human beings instructors that are happy to advise you and answer questions when

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.480
you get stuck course scheduler which is nice to work with your biz a schedule

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.640
learning paths with your series of courses and content plan by Linux

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.760
Academy's instructors iOS and Android for when you're on the go like West hey

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.040
oh and study guides like lesson audio and notebooks that you can take with you

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:00.840
and study offline and flashcards that are maintained forked and made even

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.680
better by a community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members what's not

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.880
to love go there and try it out for seven days for free Linux Academy comm

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:12.440
slash unplugged this is a tool and a platform built by Linux enthusiasts

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:16.440
wanting to spread Linux to more people and make it more accessible and this was

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.720
their mission they combined up with developers and educators and now more

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:23.040
and more people's Linux Academy is just growing like crazy and they're build out

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:26.880
a team that keeps that content fresh builds in new stuff all the time they

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:31.340
have virtual labs that they really have nailed because you can pick the course

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:35.200
where distro click that and then it'll match up with the lab server and spin

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.080
that up for you that stuff is magic and I was involved in some of the

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.360
conversations on how they were putting it together super impressed with their

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:45.620
team really smart people running Linux Academy go to Linux Academy comm slash

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.880
unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:55.440
program so I want to do a little follow we got a comment in last so we got a

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.740
couple of things so the first one I want to address is like just what it's like a

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:01.280
like a question I'd like to get people's comments that listen to the show

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.960
after the fact and the last week's show was like an hour and 27 minutes almost an

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:12.840
hour and 30 and the comment that came into the show was too short shows not

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:17.700
long enough that seems like it was probably and see in my world about an

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:24.600
hour is about probably just right for most commuters maybe hour and 45 for the

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:28.780
longer commuters 30 minutes is even a good time that's what we try to do with

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:33.320
Linux action news is about 30 minutes and it's you know so I was like I what

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.960
are your thoughts was I feel like an hour and a half was probably too long

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.580
last week I think like we went too long and so I'm kind of curious who you

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.760
think and I want to toss it out there for people listening on like the

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.320
YouTube's or and they're in their cars when they commute and can maybe tweet me

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.640
some feedback and let me know what they think or leave in the comments but your

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.560
thoughts what do you think I mean I I do agree that an hour it's a very

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:55.740
tractable time kind of understand it you know how to budget for it maybe an

01:02:55.740 --> 01:03:00.160
hour and a half is less so it does bring up a good question about like how do we

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:03.640
want to manage that what do we shoot for and when do we break you know what's our

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.360
flex there in terms of like what we're having a really good discussion it makes

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:11.960
sense to go that longer or that deep dive made sense but hmm so maybe the

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.600
content should decide yeah I think that's why we went long is like that's

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.800
just what the content called for yeah but I mean we should think about how

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.480
it's distributed how people can listen to it I know that like you know I don't

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.520
want to get in position where it's always just a little too long and then

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.160
people aren't finishing it or feel like they don't get to enjoy it the right way

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:31.240
yeah or I don't want people not listening because it's too long right

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.880
like I got other shows I gotta listen to too I can't spend an hour and a half on

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.400
one show it could be a thing I would like to think that we would be high on

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:41.000
their list but you never know so give us your feedback either in the YouTube

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.480
comments or at Chris Elias let me know speaking of at Chris Elias Paul tweeted

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:48.800
me on some moonlight follow-up from last week this is really cool so remember we

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.240
talked about moonlight is an open source project that allows you to take

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.960
advantage of NVIDIA's proprietary lockdown only to Windows on chip GPU

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:02.640
accelerated network streaming moonlight opens that up for Linux users tablet

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.040
users Raspberry Pi users like it just opens that whole thing up and it's

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.280
really slick and you and I speculated we thought well could you use this to

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.560
stream a Windows desktop to a Linux PC yeah and this would be sort of like

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.040
screw wine screw VMs I'll just put a Windows box in the corner and just

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.800
stream the whole damn desktop using moonlight yeah well Paul tweeted me and

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.520
he said at Chris Elias you can use moonlight on the entire desktop by

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:28.640
pointing it at explore dot exe and it doesn't work on grid cloud so like it

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:33.560
won't work on AWS because it requires a hardware GTX we also said well shoot put

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:37.640
this up on a cloud exactly yeah but it needs a physical GTX card for that which

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:42.520
we know we knew that actually and then Alder wrote into the unplug subreddit at

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:47.160
unplug dot reddit comm he said sometime last year I had a grand plan of putting

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:53.360
a Windows PC in a corner and using it as a gaming appliance yeah yeah he said so

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.400
the idea was run Linux on a laptop with a clean-looking office space with

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:00.240
moonlight helping to bridge the gap of missing games for Linux but suffice to

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.200
say I ran into a few problems I tried every version available of moonlight on

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:08.440
the iPad 3 on the Nexus 5x on an Android TV box Linux laptop Windows laptop

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:14.520
chromium extension and the Java client they all performed amazingly up to 720p

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:20.480
at 60 frames per second but there is some input lag but it's mostly workable

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:25.760
especially with a single-player game where the where twitch or a frame twitch

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.720
FPS or competition isn't the goal as in you know it's not super twitchy but

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:35.040
rather the experience of enjoying the game in that use case it's fantastic

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:42.000
however once I try to push it up to 1080p the leg became very bad the H to

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.120
see the h254 which I don't know if that's typo or maybe it is h254 stream

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:51.280
freaks out at times you have to wait for it to come back it does reconnect but it

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.720
does freak out from time to time he was running on an Intel for a four core

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:58.600
Intel rig with an NVIDIA 970 and then later he put a 1080 in there and he had

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:02.200
it connected to a gigabit LAN as far as you could see there wasn't a bottleneck

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.840
in the setup but he just thought maybe it wasn't up to snuff he also mentioned

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:11.200
messed around with Wi-Fi and things like that so he says you make sure we have

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.720
some network stuff but he says he's happy to report the video drivers didn't

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.160
really seem to make a big difference same performance with different video

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:20.920
drivers he says I don't I'm not sure anyways he says I just wanted you guys

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.720
to know that if you dig into it it's pretty close just needs a little more

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.840
work and give a little forgiveness on the performance from time to time but if

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:32.200
you're doing a 720p stream you're gonna be pretty happy up to 60 frames per

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.040
second that's reasonable yeah especially if you're just trying to pull you know

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:39.920
pull down a Windows desktop application like I mean after we talked about is

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:43.200
like well this could be a great way to do Photoshop or maybe even premiere

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.440
that 720p would be pretty limiting or for me you know you might even like I

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.680
remember using this plane with the steam streaming stuff yeah I just wanted to be

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.600
hanging out with my roommates in the living room but I didn't want to like

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.760
drag my tower and hook it up to the TV but they just like said I could play on

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:00.160
this little laptop and yeah kind of a similar thing kind of a similar thing

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:03.800
so thank you guys for I got a couple other people that wrote about moonlight

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:08.480
and they were similar in tone so I thought that would probably be a good

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.200
summation but I was we actually got a few bites on that moonlight topic I was

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:17.840
surprised maybe I should go try it so yeah if you do let me know let me know

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:21.600
let me know how it goes let me know how it goes if you'd like to join us here in

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:26.160
the show we'd love to have you with the we have a decent see how many people

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:30.720
right now we have if you expand the window here hold on let me see I'm gonna

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:35.200
tell you we have eight people have joined us this week which is pretty good

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.480
we love each and every one of you they're not super talkative this week but

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:42.200
we love having them here and that's nice but we have had sort of like in the past

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:46.000
we've had up to like 40 50 people in that room it's been a park and I think

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.800
the summertime is here and people are out out and about enjoying yes so there

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.440
is an opening for a new opportunity for new voices and new opinions come talk

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.920
about Linux yeah the opportunity is there it's not as crowded as it has been

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:04.600
and the you could take advantage of the summertime exodus just I think we have a

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.240
just go to the go to the chat room really because we you can find out about

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:10.480
the guide that we have you can find out about the mumble room so really the best

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.320
resource is to go to jblive.tv and just go to the embedded chat room there you

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:17.840
can do bang mumble to get the mumble server information and then we'd love to

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:21.880
have you join us next week and if you don't make it to mumble the IRC is fun

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.440
too yeah yeah you can definitely hang out in the IRC we're watching that

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:28.760
during the show as well we we do try to this is you know we have less less stuff

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:32.640
live than we did because Linux action is to be live right so this is you know

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.320
we're kind of moving more towards this is the big live show that we do for our

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:38.600
Linux community so we'd like to see more people get involved I know it's during

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:42.840
the day and that makes it rough for a lot of people right but it's just kind

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.880
of the way it's worked out for us I you know it's another option we just do it

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.600
even earlier in the day and that's gonna be good for anybody involved it's not a

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:55.280
good idea but we'd love to have you if you can make it so go to jblive.tv

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.040
you'll find the chat room or go to irc.geekshed.net and it's a hashtag

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.120
Jupiter Broadcast and you don't have to be here the whole show you know you can

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.640
chime come in chime in on a couple issues hang out and disappear yeah like

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.840
like mr. Hall today you know he came in and we would wish we kind of had to get

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.360
out of here by six o'clock East Coast time and so we just kind of you know

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:16.280
make sure we chatted to him before then and then he's chatted a bit with us then

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:20.280
he was out and I think that works too if you can't make it for the whole show

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.280
we're just happy to have you for a bit sometimes same with poppy and wimpy

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.560
they'll pop in when they're when they're not podcasting themselves yeah also I

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:31.400
guess Mozilla has a new podcast coming I saw that that's an interesting little

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:35.400
headline before we get out of here yeah there's there's been a lot going on in

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:38.840
the Linux community this week and so one of the things that I've been doing is

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.440
I've been transitioning Linux unplugged a bit to more about the community stuff

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:46.600
so you know talking with Michael Hall about endless and talking about the

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:50.680
elementary project moving over to github and I'm trying to get more community

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:53.440
stuff that isn't necessarily headline grabbing it's still good discussion here

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.880
in this show because every Monday we have Linux action news now it's about a

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:03.360
half hour long it ranges depending on the news and a hell if if our most

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:08.200
recent episode maybe it wasn't our best yet episode oh man because you know what

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.920
it was and I don't mean it too I wouldn't I really wouldn't tell my own

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.160
horn unless or whatever that's a phrase was it it's definitely not tooting my

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.400
horn actually kind of like it's I'm tooting my own horn here it's pretty

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.800
good I like that well the skirt makes it real easy so I'm not wearing a skirt I'm

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.960
not wearing anything you know I was looking at the news in Linux action news

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:31.360
6 Linux action news episode 6 we covered Debian 9 getting released tales 3

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.080
Firefox 54 free nose 11 open media vault 3 plus we did follow-up from the

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:41.360
previous week's episode and Joe gave a boon to touch on his phone a spin and we

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:46.400
managed to get all of that in 30 minutes and I I swear I'll stand by it it's all

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.480
of the most important things about all of those releases you need to know and

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:53.160
then we just get through it and it doesn't feel super rushed it just it's I

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.840
think because Joe and I have been doing Linux news coverage ourselves for so

01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.280
long that we really come into it and we really it's just I really like the way

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.660
that episode worked so if you haven't checked it out yet or if you checked it

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:08.640
out and haven't come back check out Linux action news episode 6 I thought it

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.240
turned out great and speaking of that Debian 9 story there's something I just

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:16.920
wanted to mention before we get out of here Debian 9 did come out this week

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:21.840
congratulations to the project it is always a big big deal when Debian 9

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.520
comes out and this release is dedicated to the projects founder Ian Murdock who

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:31.920
did pass away on December 28th 2015 so Debian 9 is dedicated to Ian and I

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.920
thought that was pretty cool I thought it was worth mentioning it's really kind

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:39.960
of classy of the project to do that too all right that'll bring us to an end of

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:46.640
this week's unplugged program steaming right towards rushing at a mad pace

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.400
towards our VLUG barbecue meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting go there

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:55.160
check it out if you want more Wes Payne check out the tech snap program yeah I'm

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.480
gonna be listening this week cuz there's a story that didn't make it into this

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:01.080
show that I think you guys are gonna cover in typical fantastic tech snap

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.440
fashion don't forget our mumble room we'd love to have you participate with

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:09.080
us live follow the network at Jupiter signal thanks for being here and we'll

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:21.720
see you right back here next Tuesday. Say goodbye Wes. Goodbye.

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:57.680
And the value of this is negative. So go figure I don't have my co-pilot this

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:01.960
week and right before the show starts like I was already on the air it was

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:08.240
actually I think 1.55 something like that the OBS machine lost all of our so I

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:12.120
couldn't grab like my screen and stuff like it lost all the capture yeah yeah

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.840
so I had to had to fix that super quick and then got that all solid and then I

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:23.480
started the show and realized into the show that in fact it's it's happened

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:31.520
again it happened again my my browser highlighting extension that I use that I

01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:34.880
was just using before the show started that I went through and highlighted like

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:38.920
this this fedora 26 blog post because it was thick and long and it was meaty and

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.360
I was like I like I don't need to put I don't need to read all of this in the

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.240
show because this would be an hour-long show of me just reading this post so let

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:50.320
me highlight these sections I highlight upstairs I come downstairs and using

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.240
Chrome upstairs and I come downstairs and my extensions gone and so I

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:58.400
installed it I stopped the show I stopped recording explicitly to install

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.720
because I guess like there's no way I can do this next story without this and

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.320
without you here to fill dead air time like I can't sit here and search through

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.920
a thing right so I'm like I got to stop the recording which I never do unless we

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:13.480
have a crash I stop recording then I go and I install the extension and now it's

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:17.480
gone again and I did that mid show and so there's no way I'd install the

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:22.520
extension during the show and I was using it to read up to our last story I

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:27.280
was using the highlight function and now it is actually gone from Chrome again I

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.220
really can't I can't fathom like shareware extension where you get like

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:34.760
six highlights and then it uninstalls itself it's actually you know Diago or

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.120
di GGO it's it's actually a paid service that I've been using for yeah

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:46.240
it's disabled this extension may have been corrupted it says oh what the hell

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:52.320
is repair extension okay so I just okay can I just if I can if I can click a

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.120
button and say repair extension and then another screen comes up and says would

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:58.320
you like to repair extension and I click repair extension why doesn't it just

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.480
automatically repair extension yeah and then is it is corrupt yes repair and why

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:06.440
is it corrupt on this I wonder if I'm having a mismatch in versions I wonder

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:10.120
if I have a newer version of Chrome here or something that I do upstairs I wonder

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:13.400
if that's what's going on wonder if this is a side because I didn't update on

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.680
this computer yesterday so I'm on Chrome 59 here need a script that'll just

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:21.880
update all of your workstations yeah all right JB titles calm we got to get out

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:26.000
of here for mr. West JB title leave you high and dry it's all right it's all

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.560
right it just is so I had like that hardware thing so I was it was just a

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:33.520
weird start it was a weird start for the show it was that's all right hi it's too

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.640
bad I was actually really excited about I mean I'm always excited about love but

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:39.720
I was especially excited about this one yeah we it I think at all it all shook

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:44.080
out in the end Wes it all shook out all right Jimmy titles calm everybody go

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:49.560
boat so it sounds like the way land is going it should really just be called

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.320
like I don't know it's basically like Pac-Man

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:57.880
syu but just for all of your yeah yeah yeah when we got done afterwards we're

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:01.120
because you don't when you're recording you don't know how long the length of

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:03.480
the episode is because you know you're recording for a while before you start

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:07.500
you record for a little bit after you end plus you know you might stop midway

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:11.560
during the show or something like that and so we didn't know because we had a

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.520
quite a bit more than a half hour in the recording so when it published and it

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:18.400
came in around a half hour I was like damn like that's amazing that not only

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.520
did we not like watch a clock but with all of that stuff we still managed to

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:29.200
nail it I mean I was a editing machine yeah things yeah yeah don't forget the

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:32.760
door knocker oh oh yeah oh that's actually what threw me off wow thanks

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:38.120
MN that's what threw me off super bad is so I was actually I actually had a good

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:41.320
groove going I got I bounced back from the technical failures I hadn't ran into

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.280
the gnome extension issue yet right so I hadn't hit that flaw so I didn't know

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:51.720
what was down the road but at 202 201 so this I'm starting up I'm spinning

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:55.640
everything up where I've already hit record we're getting ready to go the

01:16:55.640 --> 01:17:00.360
doorbell rings oh no and five minutes before the doorbell ring I got a

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:03.760
telegram from Angela said by the way there's somebody coming to work on the

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:07.120
roof guys having his friends over yeah right at least though she says by the

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:09.880
way somebody's coming to work on the roof don't worry I've pre-briefed him

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.720
not to ring the doorbell not to knock on the door I told him you are in there

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:18.960
recording it says I know shit yeah cuz it it always happens yeah there's no way

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:22.520
right cuz like it's instinct especially for people doing roof work like they you

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.000
know they they want you to know what that noise is they want you to know why

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.880
there's somebody in your yard so they feel obligated to talk to you right for

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:32.000
the like regardless of what they've been instructed like they feel for their own

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.920
personal reasons they have to so it always happens and so so but what threw

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:41.080
me off was like all of it like we this guy we went out of our way to tell him

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:45.600
not to do it and so that was kind of frustrating and then also like he took a

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:49.760
long time like he was just talking to me about something like I'm like I'm doing

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:53.200
I'm like I'm on the air right now I didn't say that to him I'm like like

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.120
but that frustration builds up in the back of your mind you're like okay I got

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:59.080
a clock ticking I'm I've got a sound clip you should just had him come right

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:02.120
in you kind of had that I know right I should have I'm like could you come in

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:05.120
here and talk to me yeah I had like a sound clip of for like a certain amount

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.800
of time that was playing so I didn't have dead air I'm like okay well I've

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:12.200
got this amount of time to talk to this guy before they before we have dead air

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.720
so then I sat down and I was totally flustered by it all because we just

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.440
really went out of our way to make sure that didn't happen and then I started

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.240
thinking like well god can we just never ever schedule stuff on show days but we

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.840
always have a show to sell a lot of show today yeah yeah and people don't want to

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:31.160
come out on Saturday yeah yeah so it's the after that and that really did throw

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:38.360
me off this it was a it was a weird episode you know it's just weird weird
