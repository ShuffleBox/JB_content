WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
you're my hero thanks poppy yeah you're welcome you're welcome so how the hell

00:06.000 --> 00:12.220
are you great I see you tweeting about audio editors I've been recently

00:12.220 --> 00:16.960
screwing around with I've been I've been taking another crack at the sort of the

00:16.960 --> 00:21.480
best quote-unquote audio editors for Linux which what would you say what

00:21.480 --> 00:26.680
would you say is the best audio editor for Linux what would you say yeah what

00:26.680 --> 00:30.740
would you say wimpy oh it's an audio yeah well boy boy do I agree with you

00:30.740 --> 00:34.960
wimpy boy fist bump yeah oh it's an audio is amazing but it you know the

00:34.960 --> 00:37.860
problem with those now it's a single track editor right it's great though

00:37.860 --> 00:41.840
it's it's a really it's the best audio editor out there if you just need to

00:41.840 --> 00:45.200
like need it yeah I don't do anything complicated with audio right if you just

00:45.200 --> 00:49.880
need to like clip and trim and you know cut or if you want to like open up like

00:49.880 --> 00:54.000
a video file like a movie and pull like a clip out of a movie it's great for

00:54.000 --> 00:59.600
that so it's really it's it's not it's not free software but it's free as in

00:59.600 --> 01:04.720
cost and it's really good pointing it's not open source yeah it's very good I

01:04.720 --> 01:08.920
mean I'm not and I'm not saying it's good for Linux I mean it's not good for

01:08.920 --> 01:12.320
Linux right it's good for any operate like it's better than like pretty much

01:12.320 --> 01:15.080
anything out there for any operating system it's I think it's actually

01:15.080 --> 01:19.120
available for all the operating systems but it's really good I use I use it a

01:19.120 --> 01:23.400
lot for unfilter and I like it a lot or sometimes if I just need to grab

01:23.400 --> 01:28.520
something small but yeah if you go in multi-track it's probably it's probably

01:28.520 --> 01:34.640
our door which I just I have not been happy with our door what happened to is

01:34.640 --> 01:41.040
I made a big mistake is when I I had this machine that I was testing mountain

01:41.040 --> 01:46.560
lion alright now what's it called Yosemite I was testing Yosemite on and

01:46.560 --> 01:56.120
for production and I installed audition Adobe audition it's so good it is an

01:56.120 --> 02:01.400
amazing audio editor and I had used it years ago so I was kind of like I was

02:01.400 --> 02:06.440
kind of impressed with it then but man they it's so good it's so so good it's

02:06.440 --> 02:09.800
so good and like compare and then I opened up our door again going back to

02:09.800 --> 02:15.040
because I edit I I'm currently editing women's tech radio in our door and so

02:15.040 --> 02:18.640
the the pains that I've been having in our door of kind of kind of would made

02:18.640 --> 02:22.120
me check out audition and so now I'm like trying to figure out if you can get

02:22.120 --> 02:28.160
audition to run under wine which it seems to be currently not possible so I

02:28.160 --> 02:31.680
think I don't know I I guess see I've been I've always said that Linux has

02:31.680 --> 02:34.720
really great audio editing but then and then I went and checked out our audition

02:34.720 --> 02:40.560
I was like whoo this is it's really great and like the like some of the

02:40.560 --> 02:45.960
plugins and effects that it ships with alone like it it does some really

02:45.960 --> 02:48.840
impressive like noise removal if you have like something in the line that you

02:48.840 --> 02:53.680
don't like it has a it has a I mean all all editors have this but it's actually

02:53.680 --> 02:58.400
really good like it can sample a section and then it's really good about

02:58.400 --> 03:01.880
visualizing for you how it's going to remove that and then you can adjust the

03:01.880 --> 03:04.680
sliders and you can it visually represents how it's gonna clean that

03:04.680 --> 03:08.080
noise up and you can preview it in real time in any section of the audio you

03:08.080 --> 03:14.480
want and then you can say it's just it's the tools that it has are really nice so

03:14.480 --> 03:21.520
now now now I'm feeling like our doors it's good but what right now I think our

03:21.520 --> 03:26.160
door is really good for recording but when it comes down to doing high high

03:26.160 --> 03:30.560
level of production editing like more than just cutting the top and adding

03:30.560 --> 03:36.560
music when it comes down to really getting in there I don't know all right

03:36.560 --> 03:39.520
so somebody say something here can I hear oh I have this thing yeah here we

03:39.520 --> 03:48.200
go hello who's there who is it is anybody listening there we go here we go

03:48.200 --> 03:54.960
hey there's poppy there he is hey handsome of course now poppies gonna be

03:54.960 --> 03:58.440
in mumble and there that's weird yeah there you go good man get that get them

03:58.440 --> 04:04.760
pants on that head poke why you sound pretty good for a man that uses a blue

04:04.760 --> 04:13.080
snowball you're not gonna see any picture from me though what's the matter

04:13.080 --> 04:18.240
are you a secret agent you can't you can't reveal your your image just call

04:18.240 --> 04:22.240
me paranoid right okay all right you can put up if you wanted to pull a hold up

04:22.240 --> 04:25.000
like a picture of Bill Clinton or something you can run and go get it who

04:25.000 --> 04:31.160
else do we have down here who else Jitzer what's your name Jits here there

04:31.160 --> 04:35.240
you go hello mr. corpse yeah hello do you see what do you see back on what do

04:35.240 --> 04:41.000
you see back on your screen right now from you nothing no the wall oh that's

04:41.000 --> 04:49.920
all you get myself oddly okay that's pretty you know just how when you speak

04:49.920 --> 05:01.520
the lights around the window yeah that's cool I like that yeah and you can switch

05:01.520 --> 05:09.200
to whichever video yeah that's neat I like that wow this is just like

05:09.200 --> 05:16.680
Hangouts yeah it's exactly like Hangouts only it's encrypted and secure and can

05:16.680 --> 05:27.280
it do recording it can do recording as well on the server welcome to Linux

05:27.280 --> 05:31.600
unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's putting out the welcoming Matt

05:31.600 --> 05:38.480
for all of those Mac switchers my name is Chris and my name is Matt so just

05:38.480 --> 05:41.860
before the pre-show I was asking you are you flooded at all because here up in

05:41.860 --> 05:47.960
the beautiful rainy Pacific Northwest it is bad Matt I'm taking the I have to put

05:47.960 --> 05:51.240
the four-wheel drive on to make it into the studio because I'm basically driving

05:51.240 --> 05:54.960
through a river oh wow yeah it's yeah that was one of the roads that one of

05:54.960 --> 05:58.120
the roads I take a good portion of it is totally underwater right now well I know

05:58.120 --> 06:02.040
Sylvania's just basically get your scuba gear I mean yeah I can't get to my

06:02.040 --> 06:06.040
butcher I can't they close the road yeah they're they're done I mean I've got

06:06.040 --> 06:10.720
problems Matt how am I gonna get my meat you're gonna have to boy scuba gear I

06:10.720 --> 06:13.760
mean it's gonna come down to scuba gear yeah we've been spared up here so far

06:13.760 --> 06:18.160
nothing I mean as far as but you've seen where I live I live on a gigantic like

06:18.160 --> 06:21.400
mr. burn style hill so yeah actually well one of the things I did early when

06:21.400 --> 06:24.520
we moved into the JB one studio is I actually built a boat underneath the

06:24.520 --> 06:30.120
studio I just got a wild idea to do it and so I figured we did that and so if

06:30.120 --> 06:33.400
we have any flooding here JB will be fine we'll just float hey coming up on

06:33.400 --> 06:37.160
this week's episode of the Linux unplugged show we're gonna get to some

06:37.160 --> 06:40.440
great follow-up in fact we're gonna get make good on a bet here in just a

06:40.440 --> 06:43.980
moment we're gonna cover something for the community and then mr. Richard

06:43.980 --> 06:47.200
Stallman I had a talk recently and it was pretty standard affair he has a

06:47.200 --> 06:50.800
pretty good talk that he gives but he had a couple of moments that he

06:50.800 --> 06:54.880
definitely emphasized and I wanted and I think I want to have a real talk with

06:54.880 --> 06:59.160
the virtual lug about some of the things he said and because I think there's a

06:59.160 --> 07:02.080
lot gonna be a lot of conflict in it and it's something we need to just have an

07:02.080 --> 07:05.920
honest discussion about it's not gonna be to make fun of our mess it will be to

07:05.920 --> 07:10.200
have a legitimate discussion of some of the points he makes and then later on in

07:10.200 --> 07:16.200
the show I I had a 2014 prediction that are I'm sorry 2015 prediction that more

07:16.200 --> 07:21.920
of not all not a lot not not like millions but a noticeable percentage of

07:21.920 --> 07:27.180
high-end Mac users would get frustrated and begin abandoning the Mac OS

07:27.180 --> 07:33.400
platform and switch back to Linux users that perhaps we had lost along the way

07:33.400 --> 07:40.440
a bunch of users we lost along the way that might come back well over the

07:40.440 --> 07:44.520
weekend a total s storm developed in the Mac community they ended up making it up

07:44.520 --> 07:50.120
on on CNBC national television lots of articles written about it about the

07:50.120 --> 07:54.840
decline of Mac software and about developers who've been around for 10

07:54.840 --> 07:59.360
plus years switching the Linux platform I'm gonna tell you about that and maybe

07:59.360 --> 08:03.760
if there is an advantage in there for Linux hmm yeah we'll see so why don't we

08:03.760 --> 08:08.000
bring in our our virtual lug a time appropriate greetings mumble room hello

08:08.000 --> 08:16.440
hello great to have you guys no all right so poppy since you're here let's

08:16.440 --> 08:20.560
cash in on a bet poppy you in a prediction said that if Ubuntu does not

08:20.560 --> 08:25.680
does not ship on a phone by the end of 2014 you'd wear pants on your head and

08:25.680 --> 08:29.400
here you are boom right there for the internet to see poppy making good Ninja

08:29.400 --> 08:37.480
Turtles pants on his head I hope so I hope so that's kind of like a trophy of

08:37.480 --> 08:43.160
shame now I think you should save that and then if somebody else fails a pants

08:43.160 --> 08:46.560
bet you should ship the box but they have to pay for the shipping so it's not

08:46.560 --> 08:50.560
out of your pocket like you should just pass that around now oh yeah pair of

08:50.560 --> 08:54.320
pants every time well it could be I'm just proposing that as an option it that

08:54.320 --> 08:59.520
might not be practical but as soon as it leaves my house I'm no longer obligated

08:59.520 --> 09:02.840
to wear them anymore right yeah unless you fail another bet unless you fail

09:02.840 --> 09:10.160
another bet so good on you I like this you know what honestly Matt you might

09:10.160 --> 09:14.240
have considered going this route instead of an entire monkey suit oh I know right

09:14.240 --> 09:17.920
tell me about I still got that thing oh yeah I still got my money that might

09:17.920 --> 09:20.960
yeah I might even make it make a reappearance here someday I got my man

09:20.960 --> 09:25.720
in the yellow hat outfit so he could always busted out you know we were

09:25.720 --> 09:29.960
talking about production on Linux more and more recently but on the pre-show

09:29.960 --> 09:33.760
even and Katie and life and wrote and he said hey I don't if you caught this but

09:33.760 --> 09:38.720
there's some news about Katie and live John Baptiste has gone got the Academy

09:38.720 --> 09:42.680
Award for the best application in 2014 here we go the score this is pulled he

09:42.680 --> 09:46.400
pulled from the form for Katie and live he says JBM is back with a vengeance

09:46.400 --> 09:49.360
developing Katie and live after being pretty much out of action for about a

09:49.360 --> 09:52.240
year and a half he's been slaving away porting the

09:52.240 --> 09:56.000
application to the latest version of Katie's frameworks which means there's

09:56.000 --> 09:59.800
not much of for us lowly users yet but what it means in the long run is that

09:59.800 --> 10:02.760
the application can keep moving forward with the latest developments of the

10:02.760 --> 10:07.440
underlying application framework for which it is built so in other words it

10:07.440 --> 10:10.800
sounds like Katie and live might be moving to qt5 and development has begun

10:10.800 --> 10:22.280
again I live in it oh it's it's unbelievable because it used to be you

10:22.280 --> 10:26.480
know my favorite let's crash an editor editor but here in recent years it's

10:26.480 --> 10:32.040
surprisingly will take a beating it's fast it's stable surprisingly I can add

10:32.040 --> 10:35.400
to it all day long I could have 50 lines of whatever it doesn't care it just

10:35.400 --> 10:39.720
works it's like yeah and it you know it makes a lot of like compositing and

10:39.720 --> 10:42.720
green-screening all that type stuff it makes it real easy to do I want to get

10:42.720 --> 10:47.280
used to the flow you know for casual usage I would recommend it yeah well

10:47.280 --> 10:50.040
then I'm glad to hear the development continues so thank you to Katie and I

10:50.040 --> 10:57.400
fan for sending that in I I I think I've had probably more luck with the earlier

10:57.400 --> 11:03.640
versions of open shot but um I want to like it it just it's just you know I can

11:03.640 --> 11:07.260
only hit save so many times after a while you do you have to develop a save

11:07.260 --> 11:12.280
tick you know and if I want to do anything with any you know you know more

11:12.280 --> 11:15.840
than three lines or you know oh forget it it's just it needs a little work I'm

11:15.840 --> 11:19.880
excited to see what they do in the future though so I you know since since

11:19.880 --> 11:27.320
we moved into JB one last year Rekai has been our editor so I don't actually do

11:27.320 --> 11:31.720
any video editing really anymore unless I unless I want to so it's not really

11:31.720 --> 11:37.120
been something that I've had to really push very much but I have it's called

11:37.120 --> 11:41.000
avid mucks see am I saying that right guys are you familiar with sounds close

11:41.000 --> 11:45.880
every demon yes okay so you guys all know what I'm talking about right this

11:45.880 --> 11:52.480
like for example today I got like three clips from RMS's speech and what it

11:52.480 --> 11:59.000
allows me to do is I opened up the WebM file that RMS the speeches in and I was

11:59.000 --> 12:03.400
able to go in and just say here's a marker and now here's a marker out take

12:03.400 --> 12:07.320
these take the between these two markers and save that as its own standalone

12:07.320 --> 12:11.600
WebM file and it doesn't do any recoding it doesn't it just takes that section of

12:11.600 --> 12:15.760
the file out re-encapsulates it back in a WebM wrapper and and just drops it on

12:15.760 --> 12:19.040
the file system it so there's no degradation and quality because there's

12:19.040 --> 12:23.680
no re-encoding yeah and it does it with all basically I think you got a codec

12:23.680 --> 12:27.440
for and so what you really got it which so so you might consider like if you

12:27.440 --> 12:31.280
don't need a full-fledged freaking editor sometimes you can do quite a bit

12:31.280 --> 12:35.200
which is chopping the ends and maybe even dropping in and pasting in like

12:35.200 --> 12:38.000
maybe intro and outro clips and you don't even need a full thing because

12:38.000 --> 12:41.320
then you just save that out to one a MKV master file and then you run that

12:41.320 --> 12:44.800
through handbrake to make your versions and you're done it's really easy so you

12:44.800 --> 12:47.720
don't what I'm discovering is is I started rethinking about this and what

12:47.720 --> 12:51.400
I realized is well if my if my production needs are reduced now that

12:51.400 --> 12:54.920
Rekai is really handling handling the editing of the shows then maybe I don't

12:54.920 --> 12:58.520
need a full-fledged editing suite of tools and once I kind of made that shift

12:58.520 --> 13:04.600
in mindset it really was a lot easier but it depends on your workload all

13:04.600 --> 13:09.400
right yes very good so we've got a few things I want to talk about and Colonel

13:09.400 --> 13:15.600
Linux are you still here yes you are but you're muted all right well standby I'm

13:15.600 --> 13:18.680
gonna I'm gonna go to you I'm gonna go to you but first I'll let you get your

13:18.680 --> 13:23.440
audio sorted while I take a quick moment and talk about Linux Academy so Linux

13:23.440 --> 13:26.400
Academy is a sponsor of the Linux Unplugged show and I think they're a

13:26.400 --> 13:29.520
perfect fit for our audience we were just talking about kind of moving

13:29.520 --> 13:32.320
yourself forward a little bit and trying new things and reach it changing the way

13:32.320 --> 13:35.240
you think about things that's one of the things that Linux Academy has allowed me

13:35.240 --> 13:39.040
to do here's why if you can get started by going to Linux Academy comm slash

13:39.040 --> 13:44.120
unplugged you'll get our special 33% discount Linux Academy comm slash

13:44.120 --> 13:48.960
unplugged and then you get access to all of their content I've logged in there

13:48.960 --> 13:53.440
and I've been surprised I kind of had a wreath I had a rethinking process when I

13:53.440 --> 14:00.440
went to Linux Academy comm specifically slash DevOps and I realized that DevOps

14:00.440 --> 14:03.440
is actually something that I guess I was I was sort of doing for a long time I

14:03.440 --> 14:06.120
didn't realize that's what we would call it and this is an area that's growing

14:06.120 --> 14:10.080
like like nuts and so Linux Academy has been developing courseware specifically

14:10.080 --> 14:12.800
for that area but they've also got courseware you you get anything you'd

14:12.800 --> 14:17.240
want to scratch an itch on for Linux really from mastering Linux to absolute

14:17.240 --> 14:20.360
beginner stuff and you can walk away from this and go get certifications it

14:20.360 --> 14:22.960
happens all the time in fact I've been getting some success stories which is

14:22.960 --> 14:25.560
awesome thank you to the audience for sending that in and keep sending if you

14:25.560 --> 14:29.200
get if you get a cert after taking a Linux Academy of course I love hearing

14:29.200 --> 14:32.200
about it so keep sending them in it's really encouraging too because if you

14:32.200 --> 14:35.200
ever kind of bottom out a little bit they've got a community of support that

14:35.200 --> 14:38.880
will help you kind of get going again but they also have a system that will

14:38.880 --> 14:43.600
give you really easy to adjust and assess time for how long something's

14:43.600 --> 14:45.960
gonna take you'll log in you're gonna say this section is gonna take this long

14:45.960 --> 14:48.960
this section is gonna take this long you need this much time and you can say you

14:48.960 --> 14:53.560
know what Linux Academy bro I only got so much time I'm a busy man and it will

14:53.560 --> 14:56.800
automatically create a learning plan that met that matches that amount of

14:56.800 --> 14:59.700
time you could downloadable comprehensive study guides virtual labs

14:59.700 --> 15:02.500
you can work and they'll spin them up on the back end 7 plus Linux distributions

15:02.500 --> 15:05.080
you get to choose from they automatically adjust the courseware to

15:05.080 --> 15:08.480
those Linux distributions I mean this is a seriously slick system because it's

15:08.480 --> 15:12.480
created by people they're enthusiastic and passionate about Linux now if you're

15:12.480 --> 15:15.680
a listener of this show you know what that difference means when somebody

15:15.680 --> 15:19.320
actually cares about open source and Linux versus just a general education

15:19.320 --> 15:24.880
site it is the final gap it's that gap that closes the uncanny valley linux

15:24.880 --> 15:28.960
academy.com slash unplugged get our 33 percent discount get access to

15:28.960 --> 15:33.680
everything they're doing some great new Docker courseware just went up also the

15:33.680 --> 15:37.720
puppet professional stuff the puppet stuff they've got now you start at total

15:37.720 --> 15:41.380
noob you know I know puppets this thing it lets me like manage servers and you

15:41.380 --> 15:44.440
go to like okay I'm ready to go get the cert seriously it's all the way through

15:44.440 --> 15:47.680
and you can do stuff in practicality they have scenario based courseware it's

15:47.680 --> 15:51.960
so great linuxacademy.com slash unplugged go check them out and a big

15:51.960 --> 15:56.480
thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged show

15:56.480 --> 16:01.360
all right mr. Colonel Linux are you back now I got my voice back hi there I missed

16:01.360 --> 16:05.840
you so I wanted to talk about some upcoming conferences the first one on

16:05.840 --> 16:11.200
the list is scale 13 February 19th to the 22nd it's a big one at the Hilton

16:11.200 --> 16:15.320
Los Angeles Airport are you still on your radar planning to go to this I am

16:15.320 --> 16:19.480
in fact I I've been to most of the the Linux conferences multiple times but

16:19.480 --> 16:23.240
I've never been to scale so this will be my first time at scale and I have to say

16:23.240 --> 16:29.880
the thing I'm most excited for is apparently you can paint with you can

16:29.880 --> 16:35.240
paint with like they have like a bio lab and you can then you you can take the

16:35.240 --> 16:38.760
the bio biological material and paint make like drawings and stuff with whoa

16:38.760 --> 16:43.240
yeah oh I also see they're doing the traditional PGP key signing party which

16:43.240 --> 16:47.040
is great now do you know anybody else on the crew is anybody else yet confirmed

16:47.040 --> 16:52.600
going not that I know of so we're gonna start organizing something around scale

16:52.600 --> 16:56.280
so that's coming up and and if you're thinking of going make sure you say hi

16:56.280 --> 17:00.840
to Noah and anybody else ends up making it on the crew the next big one for us

17:00.840 --> 17:05.080
where we really go all out is Linux fest Northwest 2015 it's gonna be the

17:05.080 --> 17:10.600
biggest Linux fest ever Bellingham Washington April 25th to the 26th this I

17:10.600 --> 17:13.320
think is gonna be a huge year for Linux fest because it's just been getting

17:13.320 --> 17:17.840
bigger and huger every single year and every year the feedback is always so

17:17.840 --> 17:21.240
positive that it just seems to continually grow I know this one's

17:21.240 --> 17:24.920
pretty far away because it's right up in our corner of the Pacific Northwest but

17:24.920 --> 17:28.320
I'd love to encourage the audience to make it out we're gonna go all out worst

17:28.320 --> 17:32.720
we're talking to them about having two booths so that way we have enough room

17:32.720 --> 17:37.760
to spread out and if you know if you know what that's like having two booths at a

17:37.760 --> 17:40.400
conference like this that's really quite an event and I think it's gonna be

17:40.400 --> 17:43.360
amazing and hopefully and not everything's lined up yet we're all the

17:43.360 --> 17:46.700
very beginning stages but hopefully we'll be able to live stream the entire

17:46.700 --> 17:51.080
thing and we might even be able to do that using Linux so stay tuned for

17:51.080 --> 17:54.560
information on that so I've links to both those in the show notes if you want

17:54.560 --> 17:57.920
to check out more details love to see you guys at Linux fest Northwest I think

17:57.920 --> 18:01.360
we're gonna go all out and I hope we're gonna get as much of the crew out here

18:01.360 --> 18:06.200
as possible so we'll find out and that's again April 25th in the 26 2015 in

18:06.200 --> 18:11.320
Bellingham Washington Linux fest Northwest org for more information mr.

18:11.320 --> 18:16.240
rotten corpse are you still here did you have to jet off all right and are you

18:16.240 --> 18:19.840
ready to talk about the new pick site that you set up yep sure all right so

18:19.840 --> 18:24.960
it's a Jupiter broadcasting comm slash last picks and now with the complete

18:24.960 --> 18:30.760
entire essentially nine-year history runs Linux and this is unbelievable made

18:30.760 --> 18:35.880
me realize how how old the show episode one Linux action show my Tivo runs

18:35.880 --> 18:43.480
Linux June 10th June 10th 2006 which is quite a long time ago so rotten corpse

18:43.480 --> 18:47.880
tell us about this pick site and how maybe people could contribute fork their

18:47.880 --> 18:54.280
own etc the pick site is it's it's written in PHP so if you know PHP you

18:54.280 --> 18:58.200
can help out with that in that case but if you don't you can actually contribute

18:58.200 --> 19:02.720
through adding data to from the github site so if you if you go to the github

19:02.720 --> 19:08.400
page you'll see that there is a folder says site and then inside that folder is

19:08.400 --> 19:12.920
the data file and everything's stored in the data file okay so there's a template

19:12.920 --> 19:16.080
in the data files you just copy and paste and add it to the bottom of the

19:16.080 --> 19:20.960
file and this it's that simple to just change the numbers and then add the like

19:20.960 --> 19:24.680
the name of the pick and the URL and that's and that's pretty much all you

19:24.680 --> 19:29.400
have to do and just send the send a pull request and I have a tutorial that I'm

19:29.400 --> 19:34.080
working on that explains how to do everything but also another tutorial to

19:34.080 --> 19:39.480
how to keep your stuff up to date with the main branch but the one of the

19:39.480 --> 19:45.800
things I like about the site is that it's mobile friendly so if you pull it

19:45.800 --> 19:52.240
up on a tablet or a phone it will you know responsively adjust itself to fit

19:52.240 --> 19:59.760
everything and one of the coolest features I like is the the calendar jump

19:59.760 --> 20:04.360
so you can just click that the top right button and you can choose just between

20:04.360 --> 20:10.600
no look at that that's really go back to 2012 or whatever whoo oh that's slick

20:10.600 --> 20:16.160
yeah it's especially useful on the runs Linux one boy you're making me feel

20:16.160 --> 20:20.320
really old though when I realize how old the show is that's that's kind of

20:20.320 --> 20:25.280
honestly tripping me out a little bit to see all of it linked and noted here this

20:25.280 --> 20:28.600
is really the first time I've seen a list of the show like this because the

20:28.600 --> 20:32.800
back catalogue isn't is in such disarray I've never actually seen it visualized

20:32.800 --> 20:40.080
like this as funny as that might seem there's a lot of people that helped I

20:40.080 --> 20:43.200
and you can go to the good hip thing and see that in the contribute section who

20:43.200 --> 20:49.840
helped out so it was really I couldn't done it by myself but one of the cool

20:49.840 --> 20:55.080
things that I set up is an API that so developers can take all the data out and

20:55.080 --> 20:59.120
you just go to the contribute section and there's an API link right now it's

20:59.120 --> 21:03.080
just JSON but there will be other output formats as well and you made this video

21:03.080 --> 21:08.000
here about it yeah the video is actually just the keeping your seeing I need to

21:08.000 --> 21:11.120
make I'm still might working on another people want their own their own list

21:11.120 --> 21:14.360
their own copy yeah if they want to help they need to fork the original repo and

21:14.360 --> 21:18.680
then once you make changes or someone else makes changes it might confuse

21:18.680 --> 21:22.640
people have never used it before so this video is just to help them keep their

21:22.640 --> 21:27.600
repo in sync with the master well it's pretty neat to see all this and this is

21:27.600 --> 21:30.840
a common request and something we've tried in different forms but thanks to

21:30.840 --> 21:33.520
various volunteers in the past you know they've done unofficial lists on their

21:33.520 --> 21:38.080
own they've tried doing in different capacities but this one it's it's much

21:38.080 --> 21:41.200
easier to find for one because it's just it's a Jupiter broadcasting comm slash

21:41.200 --> 21:45.880
las pics so that's nice but also I like that the community can also keep it up

21:45.880 --> 21:50.440
to date if anybody can contribute and you don't need to know how to code at

21:50.440 --> 21:54.760
all just go to the contribute section and you know just walk through it and

21:54.760 --> 21:59.960
then fork your own fork your own repo and that's it not to repeat myself but

21:59.960 --> 22:04.800
if you get up if you get a new Android device or a new Linux desktop I totally

22:04.800 --> 22:08.280
recommend going to the desktop apps or the Android apps and checking out some

22:08.280 --> 22:11.720
of the pics there are some super really really good apps I really like this list

22:11.720 --> 22:16.360
I work really hard to pick these apps to make sure they're as good as possible

22:16.360 --> 22:20.640
whenever I can it's not always possible but I really stand by all of these app

22:20.640 --> 22:24.680
picks and so if you've got a new rig to set up that's a great list to start with

22:24.680 --> 22:28.580
right there and you can again Jupiter broadcasting comm slash las pics it's just a

22:28.580 --> 22:31.040
great resource for the community and thank you for everybody who's helped

22:31.040 --> 22:34.520
rotten corpse and a big thank you to producer rotten corpse creating that for

22:34.520 --> 22:38.040
us well it was such a gold mine because I mean I remember air droid when you

22:38.040 --> 22:41.160
guys featured that you know it's just like that's what really sold me on an

22:41.160 --> 22:44.320
Android right there I was like I can't do this on my own my other device this

22:44.320 --> 22:48.480
was awesome well it's also nice for me because I have a pretty good idea of

22:48.480 --> 22:52.160
what I've covered before and I can always do a site search but to have the

22:52.160 --> 22:54.720
list and just be able to go to listen search to see have I picked this app

22:54.720 --> 22:58.560
before exactly sometimes there's ones I'd like oh how could I how could I have

22:58.560 --> 23:01.560
skipped this oh my gosh I need to go pick this right now and then it's I go

23:01.560 --> 23:05.280
search see if I've done I haven't I'm like oh I'm good this is my epic so also

23:05.280 --> 23:09.320
helps for no duplicates too yes exactly totally that's what I'm saying man tells

23:09.320 --> 23:12.280
what I'm saying thank you sir very much and to be interesting to see if any

23:12.280 --> 23:15.720
developers managed to pull that into their app that could be a that could be

23:15.720 --> 23:19.320
a neat light like when you're listening to an episode if they could pull in like

23:19.320 --> 23:23.280
here's just the pics boom from this episode right there you never know all

23:23.280 --> 23:27.160
right well I'll tell you about something I pick as digital ocean digital ocean

23:27.160 --> 23:31.320
comm sponsored Linux unplug program and use our promo code we've got it just for

23:31.320 --> 23:34.480
a little bit we're hanging on to it because we're retro because we're hip

23:34.480 --> 23:39.000
but not stirs it's unplugged December that's a $10 credit for digital ocean

23:39.000 --> 23:41.600
unplugged December and what's great about digital ocean you just go in there

23:41.600 --> 23:43.800
and apply it to your account you don't even have to put a credit card in there

23:43.800 --> 23:47.960
to try out digital ocean so what is digital ocean it's a simple cloud

23:47.960 --> 23:50.840
hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you

23:50.840 --> 23:54.600
to spin up your own server that you get root access to and you can start in less

23:54.600 --> 23:58.360
than in about 55 seconds maybe even less than that I often see a lot less than

23:58.360 --> 24:02.680
that and only it starts get this five dollars a month that'll get you 512

24:02.680 --> 24:08.000
megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer and they

24:08.000 --> 24:11.400
have data centers in New York and San Francisco and Singapore and Amsterdam

24:11.400 --> 24:15.400
and London but they're beautiful too and they have multiple data centers in those

24:15.400 --> 24:18.640
locations you can do private networking within the data centers which doesn't

24:18.640 --> 24:21.320
count against your bandwidth totals so if you want to have a front-end web

24:21.320 --> 24:25.880
server in a back-end database server or some caching that's a really really nice

24:25.880 --> 24:29.120
option you could also do something like have a couple of front-end servers in a

24:29.120 --> 24:32.520
back-end now server put open media vault on there there's all kinds of things you

24:32.520 --> 24:35.120
can do once you get once you get access to the box because you've got root

24:35.120 --> 24:40.240
control of it and what's really great is it's all powered by this dashboard the

24:40.240 --> 24:43.360
digital ocean is created and it's so great I mean they've got the super

24:43.360 --> 24:47.160
powerful hardware with the SSD drives and the tier 1 bandwidth all running on

24:47.160 --> 24:51.320
top of Linux using KVM like a boss and then they came up with this interface

24:51.320 --> 24:55.400
and I'm like are you kidding me are you serious you've made it this easy it's so

24:55.400 --> 24:59.480
intuitive and power users can replicate the interface on a larger scale digital

24:59.480 --> 25:03.040
ocean straightforward API and so there's tons of great community apps because

25:03.040 --> 25:07.800
once you get a good API for a popular service well if you make the API they

25:07.800 --> 25:11.080
will come as Kevin Costner has taught us and digital ocean knows it so they've

25:11.080 --> 25:15.480
made that we were just on the pre-show checking out meet meet Jitsi

25:15.480 --> 25:20.200
implementation that's running on a digital ocean droplet fully encrypted

25:20.200 --> 25:23.680
exactly like hangouts where it does the auto switching and you get the little

25:23.680 --> 25:27.840
tiles below of who's talking it's all built into the browser running on a

25:27.840 --> 25:32.120
digital ocean droplet right now it's so many opportunities and there's great

25:32.120 --> 25:35.520
tutorials because they're willing to pay money for those tutorials in fact we've

25:35.520 --> 25:38.320
got a link in the show notes of digital ocean pay up to $200 if you got

25:38.320 --> 25:41.520
something you can write here's an example of one I think I'm gonna go for

25:41.520 --> 25:44.640
especially as my son gets more and more into reading and then pretty soon my

25:44.640 --> 25:48.920
daughter this is how to create a clever a cleaver a e-book server on a buntu

25:48.920 --> 25:53.440
yes I said a buntu yes I said a buntu 1404 right there you go get the digital

25:53.440 --> 25:58.140
ocean droplet use our promo code unplug December you get the $10 credit you go

25:58.140 --> 26:01.720
create yourself an ebook server cleaver is amazing it's something I want to do

26:01.720 --> 26:04.960
an entire episode on at one point but now I'm thinking this is step one for me

26:04.960 --> 26:09.080
try this out it's just another use of the really millions of possibilities you

26:09.080 --> 26:12.700
could use a digital ocean droplet for unplug December digital ocean and a big

26:12.700 --> 26:17.920
thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplug program alright

26:17.920 --> 26:23.040
so Richard Stallman had a talk recently and it's pretty standard affair freedom

26:23.040 --> 26:26.480
in your computer and in the net he says for freedom in your own computer the

26:26.480 --> 26:29.760
software must be free for freedom on the internet we must organize against

26:29.760 --> 26:33.040
surveillance censorship software as a service and the war against sharing

26:33.040 --> 26:37.920
pretty common approach for mr. Stallman and a message that's definitely worth

26:37.920 --> 26:40.400
listening to in fact that's why I encouraged people at the end of last

26:40.400 --> 26:46.120
week's last to go listen to it however where I run into is a little bit of the

26:46.120 --> 26:49.080
practicalities and I want this is what I want to discuss with you guys so I've

26:49.080 --> 26:53.360
pulled three clips from his talk that he normally goes down this path but he

26:53.360 --> 26:59.120
emphasizes these points pretty hard in his talk and I think I'd like to hear

26:59.120 --> 27:02.840
from all of us who have worked in any kind of software industry where that's

27:02.840 --> 27:07.760
where that where that company's goal has been perhaps to have some level of

27:07.760 --> 27:12.080
profit and make money and I think that and that could be it could be a lot of

27:12.080 --> 27:15.680
us that work in the contract contracting capacity people who develop software

27:15.680 --> 27:21.800
and sell it and so in Richard Stallman's talk today he talks about how these

27:21.800 --> 27:25.840
companies that use software as a means to make money are simply doing it for a

27:25.840 --> 27:29.120
greedy purpose and I want to play the clip and I want to talk about it because

27:29.120 --> 27:34.480
in his opinion there's no way around it it's evil by nature proprietary software

27:34.480 --> 27:39.100
are being victimized by proprietary malware of course the reason they do

27:39.100 --> 27:43.920
this is typically for profit it's not that they're sadists that enjoy

27:43.920 --> 27:50.400
mistreating people no they're totally egoistical and they do this for profit

27:50.400 --> 27:55.880
like they the more users they make captive the more they can sell to

27:55.880 --> 28:04.640
somebody else and in effect proprietary software is all a swindle and they're

28:04.640 --> 28:10.640
not even ashamed of it they have conferences where they talk about their

28:10.640 --> 28:18.280
latest advances in how to make users captive and mistreat them in effect the

28:18.280 --> 28:23.720
proprietary software world is one where the ethical standards of treating the

28:23.720 --> 28:31.800
customers or the users have disappeared any mistreatment of those users is okay

28:31.800 --> 28:37.400
there may be some pesky laws or regulations they have to find an excuse

28:37.400 --> 28:43.840
to bypass like so his point is is that they're they're fundamentally it's

28:43.840 --> 28:49.680
gonna be an evil motive and I guess are we victims of commercial software in the

28:49.680 --> 28:53.880
sense that we are not allowed to have control over it in the end which is what

28:53.880 --> 28:59.080
his point was and here's here's why I asked this because right now we are in

28:59.080 --> 29:02.280
the thick of CES the Consumer Electronics Show is happening right now

29:02.280 --> 29:06.900
and just like Richard said these companies are up on stage and they're

29:06.900 --> 29:10.960
bragging about the ecosystem they're bragging about the lock-in I watched the

29:10.960 --> 29:16.240
ACES keynote and I I literally felt belittled I felt like he's and he's

29:16.240 --> 29:18.880
holding a phone up there he's like and for those of you who like to think out

29:18.880 --> 29:23.600
the box here's three models you can pick from because you're a renegade and it

29:23.600 --> 29:27.360
felt like they were formulaically looking at the audience and saying well

29:27.360 --> 29:31.160
these people identify as this so here's their product and these people identify

29:31.160 --> 29:34.640
as this so here's their product and it felt like they were actually their

29:34.640 --> 29:37.920
intention was the exact opposite of their message it felt it felt gross and

29:37.920 --> 29:41.400
it's all I wouldn't and and again it's about locking me into their system so

29:41.400 --> 29:46.120
what RMS says is very extreme but yet when I look at the background of CES

29:46.120 --> 29:52.280
happening right now I think long term I think you might be a little right well

29:52.280 --> 29:57.020
you know I I look at it as this from just a nuts and bolts point of view he's

29:57.020 --> 30:02.520
accurate what he's saying is true unfortunately and I and I know that he

30:02.520 --> 30:06.660
doesn't care about this but this is a reality convenience always and will

30:06.660 --> 30:11.280
until the end of time unless we end up in some apocalyptic world will always

30:11.280 --> 30:16.440
trump privacy and it just that's just a reality we give way to it every single

30:16.440 --> 30:20.600
day oh you want to use a club savings card at your grocery store it'll save

30:20.600 --> 30:24.040
you 30 cents sure you're giving up your privacy but you know it's saving you a

30:24.040 --> 30:27.920
little money and it's convenient we'll always give way to that now that's not

30:27.920 --> 30:32.160
to say everybody will but I think that that's the underlying issue you know

30:32.160 --> 30:36.180
does that make what Richard says wrong or bad in some capacity not at all no I

30:36.180 --> 30:39.760
think that what he's saying is fine I have no problem with it but I would

30:39.760 --> 30:44.720
point out that no one's going to wrap suddenly change their mind unless they

30:44.720 --> 30:49.760
experience that victimization that he's speaking of okay Colonel like show me the

30:49.760 --> 30:54.720
money what do you think you think about the money right so what so he's right

30:54.720 --> 30:58.800
when he says that those companies make a lot of decisions based purely on capital

30:58.800 --> 31:02.640
and why wouldn't they those businesses exist to make money and they don't care

31:02.640 --> 31:06.320
about users freedoms and why would they that's not a profitable aspect to them

31:06.320 --> 31:11.960
but if you make it a profitable aspect you know to them either by one as users

31:11.960 --> 31:16.400
if we say I'm just not gonna buy if I can't buy a device that I have

31:16.400 --> 31:19.080
administrative access to or can get administrative access to then I just

31:19.080 --> 31:22.760
won't buy it I'll buy all I'll buy this device or this competing device and you

31:22.760 --> 31:26.560
don't give them your money that's one way you can for that you can you can

31:26.560 --> 31:30.760
show those companies that if if they want give them a way to make money by

31:30.760 --> 31:35.400
supporting users freedoms the second way you can do that is I've gone into I

31:35.400 --> 31:37.760
can't count how many businesses I've got into and said you shouldn't use

31:37.760 --> 31:42.280
Microsoft Office you should use Libra office now there the the the concept of

31:42.280 --> 31:45.240
freedom and the concept of users rights they couldn't care less about but when I

31:45.240 --> 31:48.880
tell them well instead of paying $300 a year $400 a year to upgrade to the

31:48.880 --> 31:51.840
newest version every year you just go to this site you click on this download

31:51.840 --> 31:55.080
link and it's free for all 60 year computers and you start putting that on

31:55.080 --> 31:59.120
paper and shove it in front of a in front of a president's face now they

31:59.120 --> 32:05.360
care now yeah yeah well okay wimpy are you a victim when you buy your Amazon

32:05.360 --> 32:10.880
fire TV are you now a victim well Richard Stallman would say that

32:10.880 --> 32:17.240
I'm a victim I'm just a slave to convenience I suppose really on time

32:17.240 --> 32:21.800
yeah I'm a pragmatist much more of a pragmatist and Stallman is that's for

32:21.800 --> 32:26.640
sure rotten corpse you think in the long run though RMS is right yeah I mean I

32:26.640 --> 32:32.320
think our message kind of already proven that the the messages is right because

32:32.320 --> 32:37.560
and when he started doing this there was basically no options for like as soon as

32:37.560 --> 32:42.720
the the proprietary stuff took hold there was only proprietary stuff and now

32:42.720 --> 32:47.120
there's actually people who have joined the argument in projects like Firefox

32:47.120 --> 32:51.840
and stuff that are trying to keep things and a way for freedom is important to

32:51.840 --> 32:57.280
them and I think in the long term it will be eventually it will people will

32:57.280 --> 33:01.240
realize but it's in the short term it's really hard to convince them other than

33:01.240 --> 33:06.760
the you know the stuff that's free money wise but I think that what mad dog said

33:06.760 --> 33:11.800
is also a really good point that instead of trying to explain the freedom

33:11.800 --> 33:17.080
explain the fact that you're technically a slave to the product the products okay

33:17.080 --> 33:20.320
wimpy go ahead take your shot so you think fire TV and freedom there's

33:20.320 --> 33:25.760
intersection here you're ready to defend it go no I'm not going to defend it what

33:25.760 --> 33:31.200
I was going to say is that for me the fire TV is a convenient device because

33:31.200 --> 33:37.200
it was inexpensive and I can plug it in and it works and it does what I need it

33:37.200 --> 33:46.760
to do but if I needed to exercise my freedoms then I'm perfectly capable of

33:46.760 --> 33:56.440
building a XBMC or Cody set-top box using a Raspberry Pi and streaming the

33:56.440 --> 34:02.920
content over NFS from a server in the house so I have I have my choices I've

34:02.920 --> 34:08.320
just chosen convenience over protecting my freedoms in this case and let's not

34:08.320 --> 34:14.880
forget the the content that I'm consuming on my fire TV or my XBMC Cody

34:14.880 --> 34:23.040
box is proprietary and copyright and license encumbered anyway so all right

34:23.040 --> 34:29.200
fair enough but a daredevil let me ask you this if those of us who have the

34:29.200 --> 34:32.960
option to implement a free system don't elect to do it then who will and will

34:32.960 --> 34:37.880
those options fade away long term here I mean I'm talking really big picture like

34:37.880 --> 34:43.760
this is in a way the expression of human thought it is it is something that maybe

34:43.760 --> 34:47.800
should be protected and if those of us who have the means to implement the

34:47.800 --> 34:51.480
version that protects that thought for the future generations don't implement

34:51.480 --> 34:56.080
those options daredevil I'm asking you don't we sort of condemn those options

34:56.080 --> 35:03.320
yes but I feel that we have an option to still make a transition easier but

35:03.320 --> 35:07.800
currently the tools that we have at our disposal have been really hard to push

35:07.800 --> 35:12.560
to the public but there is a place that we're starting to get our feet in which

35:12.560 --> 35:17.440
is into in government institutions because of cost and through this we can

35:17.440 --> 35:21.960
influence a future road pad that actually makes sensible copyright law

35:21.960 --> 35:27.880
that actually fixes the problem at its core not just you know we're still on

35:27.880 --> 35:31.640
the fight corporations free software and sometimes the corporation is aligned

35:31.640 --> 35:37.280
with us and then it gets fuzzy right well I feel that RMS RMS would disagree

35:37.280 --> 35:42.080
with you so you are you sound like an optimist that's nice RMS would say no

35:42.080 --> 35:47.080
it's not going to go that way in fact RMS says well our duty is is we have to

35:47.080 --> 35:53.720
protest these come now and we have to fight back for instance we have to

35:53.720 --> 35:59.520
protest whenever the representatives of the companies that mistreat people show

35:59.520 --> 36:06.800
up to speak recruit or whatever if there's an Apple or Microsoft or Adobe

36:06.800 --> 36:14.600
or etc recruiting team coming to your university well organize a protest and

36:14.600 --> 36:25.920
teach explain to people why it why that company is doing harm so popiah I know

36:25.920 --> 36:28.840
this is maybe a point that you might have contention with do you think the

36:28.840 --> 36:32.080
appropriate way to express this is through protesting like the Apple genius

36:32.080 --> 36:38.960
by yeah well yeah I have I mean you've obviously poked something there where I

36:38.960 --> 36:47.160
I have I I don't like some of the the means by which this is done I think the

36:47.160 --> 36:51.320
positive way to do things is to write good software write good free software

36:51.320 --> 36:58.120
to continually berate companies that make proprietary software I don't isn't

36:58.120 --> 37:02.560
working I don't think it ever has really worked I think what has worked is

37:02.560 --> 37:08.320
producing great alternatives to proprietary software in the form of free

37:08.320 --> 37:15.720
software hmm and how do you also market that software well and yeah honestly it

37:15.720 --> 37:20.240
even fails the core our economic economies are based on intellectual

37:20.240 --> 37:25.120
property the real exports of nowadays modern societies is intellectual

37:25.120 --> 37:30.400
property if you don't fix it in a way that incentivizes business to move away

37:30.400 --> 37:34.480
from that direction then you're killing yourself it's not just asking to the

37:34.480 --> 37:38.480
corporations to stop it's asking the country to stop and that doesn't make

37:38.480 --> 37:43.600
sense to anybody so that I feel that there needs to be a tangible way to make

37:43.600 --> 37:46.760
a transition if you don't offer a transition to people they won't care

37:46.760 --> 37:50.640
because they will look at the benefits of these proprietary software and

37:50.640 --> 37:55.200
actually discard some of the inconveniences right we need to teach

37:55.200 --> 37:59.000
people in one hand but at the same time we need to provide a transitional and

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
not just with quality software because quality software can be transformed into

38:02.000 --> 38:06.280
proprietary look at PSD license for example explicitly allows this and I

38:06.280 --> 38:10.680
feel that if you don't fix the core issues you're going to run into them

38:10.680 --> 38:15.440
later or sooner it doesn't matter you will run into them RMS would argue that

38:15.440 --> 38:18.600
I think it needs to begin with the individual developer at the end of the

38:18.600 --> 38:22.840
talkie to the Q&A and the question came up well what if I want to make money

38:22.840 --> 38:28.800
might like to make living out of selling their software so which business model

38:28.800 --> 38:33.420
would you okay the first question is they might point is they might like to

38:33.420 --> 38:37.520
do that but if they but that doesn't justify or excuse doing it in an

38:37.520 --> 38:43.800
unethical way proprietary software is an injustice they shouldn't do that but

38:43.800 --> 38:47.880
there are there are many free software business models like there is selling

38:47.880 --> 38:54.360
support there is constructing custom solutions paid by the clients you can

38:54.360 --> 38:58.960
deliver the solution is free software the clients still gonna have to pay there

38:58.960 --> 39:03.520
is crowdfunding there's just plain asking for donations there's a new

39:03.520 --> 39:09.440
package called Lily pond for editing musical scores and the maintainer gets

39:09.440 --> 39:14.000
enough money just from users that are happy and send it there are others as

39:14.000 --> 39:18.920
well there are big companies that fund development of useful free software

39:18.920 --> 39:24.800
governments fund a lot especially in Europe so yes there are ways to do this

39:24.800 --> 39:32.040
but if you don't find one that doesn't excuse non free software next so that's

39:32.040 --> 39:35.120
a pretty radical stance and I think that's where it starts to lose the

39:35.120 --> 39:38.920
message with a lot of people dare W have any follow-up thoughts on that yes and

39:38.920 --> 39:43.560
this is as a software developer I have to agree you can actually because your

39:43.560 --> 39:46.880
client especially when it's a client that doesn't have the technical

39:46.880 --> 39:52.000
understanding you can claim that this is the appropriate way of doing and I work

39:52.000 --> 39:58.560
on my own bucket so I can decide these things but I understand that the models

39:58.560 --> 40:03.600
and the great companies currently didn't weren't like in you United States you

40:03.600 --> 40:09.120
have a red hat and we here kind of have open Sousa right so Sousa but it's still

40:09.120 --> 40:14.480
around of a hybrid model you still have canonical it's still a hybrid model so

40:14.480 --> 40:19.280
there has some some benefits on the hybrid model otherwise it wouldn't be

40:19.280 --> 40:26.720
the selected model right so unless there is a fix on the policy I don't think

40:26.720 --> 40:33.240
there will be not even a fight that will actually make a dent in solving the

40:33.240 --> 40:38.400
issue we as developers we can bring up but most of us can actually argue that

40:38.400 --> 40:42.360
we're already doing free software for the companies we give our copyright to

40:42.360 --> 40:46.240
the company that paid us so as developers are really doing committing a

40:46.240 --> 40:51.160
crime perhaps the company model is but at that point is like me saying I'm

40:51.160 --> 40:56.600
going to enforce anyone that's got my software do not use it somewhere else

40:56.600 --> 41:02.840
like yeah can I just interject yes and point out that this isn't actually an

41:02.840 --> 41:07.840
abstract argument because what RMS is talking about is a framework of social

41:07.840 --> 41:12.640
justice that is around software but is in terms of technology that we're using

41:12.640 --> 41:16.840
now for technology that we can be more important to us in the future things

41:16.840 --> 41:22.640
like you know heart pacemakers care I know smarter TV smart cars exactly now

41:22.640 --> 41:26.880
the point is okay how ethical is it for someone like a right to not be have

41:26.880 --> 41:31.640
access to the safety aspects of those devices to make sure that they are safe

41:31.640 --> 41:36.560
for them okay when some company decides care out to look up a care right and

41:36.560 --> 41:41.240
throw their key I look at it from a completely different perspective from

41:41.240 --> 41:44.320
that too I look at it from a 200 year perspective I try to think ahead and I

41:44.320 --> 41:48.800
try to think looking back at our history and our creations if these things are

41:48.800 --> 41:54.200
locked away behind these proprietary licenses and walls in the long term

41:54.200 --> 41:58.880
they're a loss they don't they don't better the whole which is kind of sad

41:58.880 --> 42:03.280
well it is human nature to share things I mean the whole point about proprietary

42:03.280 --> 42:07.280
stuff okay is that you know when man discovered a fire okay wasn't something

42:07.280 --> 42:10.320
he hoarded himself care right and kept for himself right there's a question

42:10.320 --> 42:13.360
okay you know everyone who benefited from the idea of care from you know

42:13.360 --> 42:17.320
making fire that's because inherently okay it's a human nature okay to swap

42:17.320 --> 42:21.800
ideas going to discuss and two things it's this in sort of you know

42:21.800 --> 42:27.200
commercialistic aspect okay that's made us sort of very it is against human

42:27.200 --> 42:31.000
nature like that's why I think a lot of people get into software like on the

42:31.000 --> 42:33.400
commercial desktops I think that's why a lot of people get into piracy I think

42:33.400 --> 42:37.560
that's why a lot of people share stuff before I knew about music piracy I was

42:37.560 --> 42:41.120
making mixed tapes with friends and we were sharing them I didn't know that was

42:41.120 --> 42:44.040
stealing music that was just sharing something I liked with my friends oh

42:44.040 --> 42:48.320
hell back in 1982 okay I was sharing all these spectrum games on tapes and

42:48.320 --> 42:53.840
everything yeah very much so very much so so the whole talk is linked in the

42:53.840 --> 42:57.600
show notes if you want to check it out one thing is is you know the message is

42:57.600 --> 43:02.480
always very strong and then if you think about a little bit sometimes you get to

43:02.480 --> 43:05.920
the truth underneath it I'll tell you about the truth of my savings that's

43:05.920 --> 43:11.400
ting go to linux.ting.com sponsor of the Linux unplugged show and now I have

43:11.400 --> 43:17.080
turned the corner on my two years with tang and what's well yeah I know I know

43:17.080 --> 43:20.160
it's awesome and it's great because I've only paid for what I use I've got no

43:20.160 --> 43:23.760
contract nor the termination fee and remember ting's got that savings

43:23.760 --> 43:28.160
calculator so if you're noodling around how much you would save go put in your

43:28.160 --> 43:31.600
actual monthly usage so how many you make a lot of calls let's say you make

43:31.600 --> 43:35.160
and let's say you make a hundred minutes I doubt it I doubt it do you even talk

43:35.160 --> 43:38.640
on the phone for an hour let's let's say 60 minutes go you know let's say you do

43:38.640 --> 43:41.860
let's say 80 minutes because you know grandma called text messages you know

43:41.860 --> 43:46.800
you get that damn SMS system that goes off accidentally because something went

43:46.800 --> 43:50.600
off on your alert system so you get 300 text messages let's say but normally you

43:50.600 --> 43:53.840
don't but let's just say this this month you got a lot of text messages and

43:53.840 --> 43:58.080
megabytes used because then you had to go log into the remote GUI to disable

43:58.080 --> 44:01.120
the alerts and of course it downloads all those damn graphs every time you

44:01.120 --> 44:04.520
have to do it let's say you used 800 megabytes so I don't so you know what

44:04.520 --> 44:07.720
you used a gig it was a really bad month because your job sucks so now what was

44:07.720 --> 44:10.100
your bill because you're in a contract right if it's bill if your bills like

44:10.100 --> 44:15.000
mine let's say it's 130 bucks all right you go calculate your savings just go

44:15.000 --> 44:17.960
see what you do now depending on your usage these numbers will change so go

44:17.960 --> 44:20.680
over to the ting calculator and try it out but boom over a two-year period if

44:20.680 --> 44:23.760
you're like Chris and you're at your team you're making you're just passing

44:23.760 --> 44:28.600
the two-year mark two thousand three hundred and twenty eight dollars saved

44:28.600 --> 44:32.300
over two years by switching to ting and ting is just starting to get better not

44:32.300 --> 44:35.720
only do they have an early termination relief program no hold customer service

44:35.720 --> 44:41.120
an incredible dashboard but ting is also going to GSM in February will you be

44:41.120 --> 44:45.320
able to see them at CDMA and GSM under one account and one of the things I love

44:45.320 --> 44:51.320
about ting is they've always got your back this model allows for them to be

44:51.320 --> 44:56.560
unlike any other carrier and so one of their series they have on their blog now

44:56.560 --> 45:00.840
the ting tip and the first one in the ting tip is reducing your data usage in

45:00.840 --> 45:04.680
Google Chrome so if you use Chrome on Android like I've been using I like

45:04.680 --> 45:08.480
Firefox 2 on Android but I've been using Chrome more they have a step-by-step

45:08.480 --> 45:14.600
process with nice animated gifs so our gifts whatever you want so you can just

45:14.600 --> 45:18.240
go they don't have flash come on right you're not an animal plus it works on

45:18.240 --> 45:20.880
your mobile this way and you go in you go through these settings and they'll

45:20.880 --> 45:24.280
talk to you about how do you do reduce data usage on Chrome the ting blog is

45:24.280 --> 45:28.880
always featuring really great stuff app pics stuff about their GSM coverage and

45:28.880 --> 45:32.200
now these the ting tips to help reduce data usage yeah the mobile carrier is

45:32.200 --> 45:36.200
writing up great how-to's to save data and by the way you don't have to be a

45:36.200 --> 45:39.160
ting customer obviously to take advantage of these tips but it's pretty

45:39.160 --> 45:43.280
cool that things put them out there so go to the linux.ting.com linux.ting.com

45:43.280 --> 45:50.160
it's linux l-i-n-u-x I'm sorry gnu linux was already taken we couldn't we

45:50.160 --> 45:53.800
couldn't use that one so it's just linux.ting.com they'll take $25 off your

45:53.800 --> 45:57.360
first ting device if you got a ting compatible device guess what you got one

45:57.360 --> 45:59.960
you can just bring with you they're gonna give you $25 of credits would

45:59.960 --> 46:04.040
probably pay for your first month oh ting it's pretty great linux.ting.com

46:04.040 --> 46:09.360
and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the linux unplugged show so one of the

46:09.360 --> 46:13.200
things we noticed colonel linux and I when we're at these events is there in a

46:13.200 --> 46:19.600
wash of Mac books it is gross it is full of Mac books so we're gonna talk a

46:19.600 --> 46:22.520
little bit about this and I want to say at the beginning of the segment if

46:22.520 --> 46:26.640
you're listening to this show and Mac OS X works for you and the Mac hardware

46:26.640 --> 46:31.920
works for you no judging good for you I have no problems with that this is not

46:31.920 --> 46:37.560
going to be an attack on your choices if I acknowledge that for many it works

46:37.560 --> 46:42.680
probably many so I want to just disclaim that right now this is not an attack on

46:42.680 --> 46:48.040
those of you who choose to use the Mac but I made the prediction in our

46:48.040 --> 46:51.280
predictions episode that I felt like people are gonna start getting really

46:51.280 --> 46:55.800
burned out with Mac OS 10 the quality isn't so good you start to feel the

46:55.800 --> 47:01.800
walls of the sandbox pretty quick and you kind of get tired and burned out on

47:01.800 --> 47:05.360
what I call like it's it's I don't have a great term for it but I think of it as

47:05.360 --> 47:10.600
like the marketing debt of OS 10 like there's a there is a direction that

47:10.600 --> 47:15.280
Apple as a company is going in and in order to make the whole product line

47:15.280 --> 47:19.760
look like it's going in that direction Apple will unnecessarily do things to OS

47:19.760 --> 47:23.280
10 to fit that like you know all of a sudden rebranding the way it looks with

47:23.280 --> 47:27.880
unneeded transparencies that slow it down or yearly release cycles that way it

47:27.880 --> 47:31.200
feels like your phone's firmware and you think of it as a firmware not an OS

47:31.200 --> 47:35.000
release and in the meantime they don't have enough time to do Q&A these kinds

47:35.000 --> 47:39.360
of things I feel like will begin to grate on people so that's where we begin

47:39.360 --> 47:46.640
today Marco Armit who is he was a guy that originally wrote tumblr he created

47:46.640 --> 47:51.920
Instagram he's the current developer of overcast he hosts the podcast accidental

47:51.920 --> 47:56.200
tech podcast and he used to be the publisher of the magazine and he's one

47:56.200 --> 48:02.120
of the top sellers in the iOS App Store and he wrote on his blog over the

48:02.120 --> 48:05.120
weekend that Apple has lost the functional high ground that Apple's

48:05.120 --> 48:11.000
hardware while great met does not is not matched in OS quality in fact he goes on

48:11.000 --> 48:15.640
to say that it's gotten pretty bad and he goes on to cite that a recent

48:15.640 --> 48:20.480
developer a well-known developer who's switching to the Linux desktop so Marco's

48:20.480 --> 48:24.200
argument here is that essentially what my prediction was is that Apple's

48:24.200 --> 48:27.020
marketing is pushing the OS in directions and at a pace that they

48:27.020 --> 48:30.200
cannot sustain internally development wise that the quality has been on a

48:30.200 --> 48:35.480
rapid decline in fact word-for-word he says I suspect the rapid decline of

48:35.480 --> 48:39.240
Apple software is a sign that the marketing is too high a priority at

48:39.240 --> 48:43.640
Apple today this is a long-term Apple developer who makes his money on the

48:43.640 --> 48:47.120
Apple platform saying this not Chris this is not Chris saying this this is

48:47.120 --> 48:52.000
Marco saying this and I think that's remarkable and this also comes just

48:52.000 --> 48:57.680
after Jeff Wozniak or geoff Wozniak I'm not sure how you say his name 10 year

48:57.680 --> 49:02.760
developer of OS 10 switch to Linux in late 2014 and he says it was the best

49:02.760 --> 49:07.560
tech decision he made all year he says he started using OS 10 in 2005 when OS 10

49:07.560 --> 49:12.560
was at version 10.4 Tiger he was having troubles with Linux and he moved over to

49:12.560 --> 49:17.840
OS 10 he was happy as up to OS 10.6 snow leopard thought it was pretty good then

49:17.840 --> 49:21.960
things started to show up that he didn't like an OS 10.7 features like launchpad

49:21.960 --> 49:24.960
that didn't really resonate with him and as things progressed he became

49:24.960 --> 49:28.720
increasingly annoyed and disconnected with the environment he said he found

49:28.720 --> 49:31.400
he'd stopped using the majority of the primary apps that shipped with OS 10

49:31.400 --> 49:36.320
like mail Safari iTunes and the Apple creativity apps like the iLife suite for

49:36.320 --> 49:40.880
the more for the most part he says he ran essentially Firefox mailmate and a

49:40.880 --> 49:44.840
terminal most of his work was done in terminals the culture of the operating

49:44.840 --> 49:47.560
system at this point was more about sharing than it was personal

49:47.560 --> 49:50.480
productivity in short he says I was working against the grain of the

49:50.480 --> 49:55.640
environment I was working against the grain of the environment I was in a

49:55.640 --> 50:00.120
gradual transition but OS 10 it went from a useful tool that got my work done

50:00.120 --> 50:05.520
to obnoxious ecosystem that I no longer wanted to be part of he goes on to talk

50:05.520 --> 50:09.280
about how it was daunting that there was a complete lack of transparency in

50:09.280 --> 50:12.880
future software development and a decline in quality as he perceived it

50:12.880 --> 50:17.040
which makes it a tenuous relationship when you're using as your development

50:17.040 --> 50:22.960
platform and then he says 10.10 Yosemite hit the upgrade was egregious he says

50:22.960 --> 50:28.360
messages in 10.10 is a complete shit show it's a stunning regression he says

50:28.360 --> 50:32.640
at this point my default position on Apple software and OS 10 has moved from

50:32.640 --> 50:36.520
probably good to probably not okay they seem more interested in pumping out

50:36.520 --> 50:40.720
quantity by the way of upgrades it's death by it's death by a thousand cuts

50:40.720 --> 50:44.400
but it's death nonetheless he says I came to realization I was

50:44.400 --> 50:48.540
frustrated disappointed by OS 10 and I didn't see it getting better so I quit

50:48.540 --> 50:52.800
now he goes on to admit I've gone back to running Linux and I consider it

50:52.800 --> 50:58.120
somewhat inferior if not markedly inferior to OS 10 OS 10 in terms of

50:58.120 --> 51:02.920
usability but it feels like a personal computer again I'm enjoying the

51:02.920 --> 51:06.440
experience and look forward to working with it even if it's a monumental pain

51:06.440 --> 51:13.280
in the ass and then he links to Paul's audio yeah you know that was probably

51:13.280 --> 51:17.120
the most truthful article I've heard in a long time because he nailed it at the

51:17.120 --> 51:21.440
end he nailed it in the middle yeah ten-year developer on OS 10 plus you've

51:21.440 --> 51:27.480
got Marco arm at one of the top iOS developers now to top it all off panic

51:27.480 --> 51:33.280
one of the longest time developers for the mac OS platform panic one of the

51:33.280 --> 51:38.000
biggest independent development shops for OS 10 one of the most respected and

51:38.000 --> 51:43.640
well-known creators of iOS apps and OS 10 applications did a year-end post and

51:43.640 --> 51:48.040
they talked about the challenges in this 2014 review iOS upgrades they talked

51:48.040 --> 51:52.040
about how iOS upgrades have not been very well done they talked about how

51:52.040 --> 51:56.720
they had to leave the Mac App Store they say that it hasn't been going very well

51:56.720 --> 52:01.580
in the Mac App Store and that sales the sales after leaving didn't suffer they

52:01.580 --> 52:05.400
talked about the app review process being atrocious but here's the most

52:05.400 --> 52:13.080
devastating number of all they break down their sales 51% of panic sales are

52:13.080 --> 52:22.240
on iOS 49% of panic sales are on the Mac okay 51 on iOS 49 on the Mac but

52:22.240 --> 52:32.520
revenue only 17% on iOS 83% on the Mac even though they sell more on iOS they

52:32.520 --> 52:38.520
make dramatically less money which I believe a lot of developers are learning

52:38.520 --> 52:43.280
about the whole entire Mac ecosystem and the whole premise of getting developers

52:43.280 --> 52:48.320
to buy these Mac books to get Xcode to get a Mac is so they can get in this app

52:48.320 --> 52:54.680
store this gold mine but these are top-tier Apple developers top-tier Apple

52:54.680 --> 52:59.880
developers saying it doesn't make economic sense they say iOS represents

52:59.880 --> 53:04.560
just 17% of our total revenue despite selling more than half of our total unit

53:04.560 --> 53:10.600
sales that's huge it's part of this crazy huge mobile users won't pay enough

53:10.600 --> 53:14.640
money but there's a lot of problems there so I think you know this this

53:14.640 --> 53:18.440
promise of the App Store has pushed a lot of people to buy Macs but this

53:18.440 --> 53:22.680
promise seems to be flopping on its face you've got these prominent developers

53:22.680 --> 53:26.880
that are saying look at these things aren't right quality's down I lay they

53:26.880 --> 53:30.360
Marco Armand his post says the stuff that we used to give Windows users a

53:30.360 --> 53:33.760
hard time about like we've got no room to talk Windows is getting nice and

53:33.760 --> 53:38.040
stable meanwhile our crap can't run very well and I totally concur with that like

53:38.040 --> 53:44.640
you know we just upgraded the Wirecast system to Mavericks which is 10.9 even

53:44.640 --> 53:48.280
though 10.10 is out because the quality of the releases takes about a year

53:48.280 --> 53:51.840
before they're usable in a high production workload it's getting pretty

53:51.840 --> 53:57.960
bad so I wonder is Linux in a good position to pick up this mess because

53:57.960 --> 54:01.040
it's gonna get pretty bad before people are gonna switch and that could take a

54:01.040 --> 54:05.200
little while and legitimately so Windows 10 isn't that far away right I mean

54:05.200 --> 54:07.920
Windows 10 is a couple years away they're gonna have a really strong

54:07.920 --> 54:11.640
message especially to power users as yours looking pretty good people could

54:11.640 --> 54:15.600
want to get in on that Matt do you think Linux is in a position to pick up some

54:15.600 --> 54:19.040
of these what about these folks who switch to the Mac that might be

54:19.040 --> 54:22.680
switching back do you think we're in a position are we ready for that I think

54:22.680 --> 54:27.800
so I well let me let me preface that yes and no yes in that we have the

54:27.800 --> 54:31.320
bare-bones stuff necessary to make this happen yes it's absolutely in existence

54:31.320 --> 54:35.880
if we could actually get I don't know the word out beyond the echo chamber

54:35.880 --> 54:39.560
that would be an amazing thing that's yet to happen I hope it does that's what

54:39.560 --> 54:42.680
needs to happen and where Microsoft will be picking up the pieces if we don't get

54:42.680 --> 54:45.200
you know our heads out of our butts and get that happening if we get the word

54:45.200 --> 54:48.280
out hey there is an alternative you guys should check this out then get some of

54:48.280 --> 54:52.560
these developers to actually you know utilize it and then share the software I

54:52.560 --> 54:57.000
don't know developed for Linux you know as an option I think we might actually

54:57.000 --> 55:00.240
see a shift but until that happens you know I think that we're gonna

55:00.240 --> 55:04.880
perpetuate this the usual circle jerk I really do well and I said here's a case

55:04.880 --> 55:09.320
set up here's a case study Michael Dominic co-host of the quarter radio

55:09.320 --> 55:14.760
program yeah longtime Mac developer hadn't needed a second workstation and

55:14.760 --> 55:20.080
he grabbed a Dell laptop and our desktop I'm not sure and he installed Ubuntu

55:20.080 --> 55:25.040
Mate 1404 edition that Wimby and team have put out and for him he says you

55:25.040 --> 55:29.200
know at the end of day Chrome is Chrome sublime text is sublime text and I need

55:29.200 --> 55:32.480
a terminal and I was able to get all of the work done I needed to do on this

55:32.480 --> 55:37.360
machine and I think that's significant I think it is so I think that to further

55:37.360 --> 55:41.000
preface this even more for developers absolutely we'll see a shift I don't

55:41.000 --> 55:43.560
think there's any question of that I think where we're gonna continue to

55:43.560 --> 55:48.040
fall down those that they're gonna be using Linux boxes to make software for

55:48.040 --> 55:51.400
Windows and they're gonna be using Linux boxes to make software for you know for

55:51.400 --> 55:54.740
other platforms and probably a lot of mold and web services big time on web

55:54.740 --> 55:59.200
services I don't see anything really happening on the Linux desktop and and

55:59.200 --> 56:02.400
that's sad no I mean as far as the developers that are actually developing

56:02.400 --> 56:05.680
for it yeah they're doing their thing but as far as the big migration that

56:05.680 --> 56:09.880
we're hoping for no one if I go outside and scream hey I'm using Linux no one

56:09.880 --> 56:13.000
has any idea what I'm talking about I mean that's not changing we don't

56:13.000 --> 56:16.320
actually get out there and change that we talk about it but no one actually

56:16.320 --> 56:19.400
doesn't well and if we're just looking if we're just looking at the high-end

56:19.400 --> 56:22.600
technical users the users that are looking for an exodus from the Mac

56:22.600 --> 56:26.240
platform wimpy make me feel better are you saying you're seeing a pretty good

56:26.240 --> 56:31.920
percentage of Mac hardware yeah within the Ubuntu Marte community I was really

56:31.920 --> 56:36.720
surprised at how many people there are that are using Mac hardware and that's

56:36.720 --> 56:44.120
a mixture of Intel Mac books is that what they're called I don't know I've

56:44.120 --> 56:52.840
never seen one somebody somebody in the community has put together a power PC

56:52.840 --> 56:58.620
build of Ubuntu Marte which runs on the the you know iBooks the g4s and what

56:58.620 --> 57:04.840
have you so I'm actually working with them to try and improve that so I when

57:04.840 --> 57:09.160
when I had some hardware difficulties that some of the Jupiter broadcasting

57:09.160 --> 57:14.000
community helped solve for Ubuntu Marte and this is things like UAFI because

57:14.000 --> 57:19.800
again I've never seen one of those whatever a UFA is it most of the people

57:19.800 --> 57:24.520
that volunteered to help were running Mac books of some description yeah I've

57:24.520 --> 57:28.000
gotten emails from folks on Mac books on power PC MacBook specifically saying

57:28.000 --> 57:34.040
they're doing Mate edition I had I had 30 people participate in the testing and

57:34.040 --> 57:39.360
the feedback and 24 of them were on Mac hardware and this was in the real early

57:39.360 --> 57:43.560
days of Ubuntu Marte when it was in the alphas and I was genuinely surprised by

57:43.560 --> 57:48.720
that and of course what they do is they stick plank or doki on it and they

57:48.720 --> 57:56.040
recreate a Mac OS 10 type workflow because you know Mac OS 10 is a

57:56.040 --> 58:02.160
traditional desktop by and large right Colonel Linux this is why we've got to

58:02.160 --> 58:05.880
make Linux work better on the MacBook hardware don't you think I think that's

58:05.880 --> 58:10.520
a I think that's a great first step but it it that won't entirely solve the

58:10.520 --> 58:15.120
problem because if you had if let's just say everyone let's just say we have a

58:15.120 --> 58:18.600
max exodus from the max and everyone comes over to Linux and now everyone

58:18.600 --> 58:22.160
installs Linux on their MacBook that's a great first step but when those people

58:22.160 --> 58:25.520
go out to buy a new computer it can't be a MacBook again if they go out and buy a

58:25.520 --> 58:28.600
MacBook again they continue to give Apple their money and they continue to

58:28.600 --> 58:33.080
put Linux on it then Apple can then then Apple continues to win they continue to

58:33.080 --> 58:36.000
they're gonna continue putting what's what's the difference if I buy a Lenovo

58:36.000 --> 58:40.520
with Windows on nothing nothing but but that and that's where things like system

58:40.520 --> 58:45.240
76 where the Librem laptop come in is where where you're not supporting

58:45.240 --> 58:48.600
Microsoft by buying a Lenovo laptop or where you're not supporting Apple by

58:48.600 --> 58:53.920
buying a MacBook although I will throw this in there I think that Apple goes a

58:53.920 --> 58:57.280
lot further out of their way to make it difficult to run alternate operating

58:57.280 --> 59:01.560
systems on their computer than than Lenovo does with with Windows Lenovo

59:01.560 --> 59:04.560
would more than happily sell Linux on their laptops that people were willing

59:04.560 --> 59:08.560
to pay for it I don't know that Apple feels the same way sure although I would

59:08.560 --> 59:14.120
I would argue that we've solved greater challenges and also I think you know

59:14.120 --> 59:18.040
obviously what you say is ideal like if you know we get hardware that was ready

59:18.040 --> 59:21.280
to go with Linux that'd be amazing in the stores that'd be great the reality

59:21.280 --> 59:26.200
is the store experience is awful it's only getting worse and the Apple stores

59:26.200 --> 59:29.720
are better than going to Best Buy to buy hardware from a consumer standpoint so

59:29.720 --> 59:32.800
that's where they're gonna go and I think it's impractical if we don't

59:32.800 --> 59:38.480
assume that not only is the MacBook appealing but that Apple is not standing

59:38.480 --> 59:41.840
still they're gonna make better newer MacBooks like there's a rumor right now

59:41.840 --> 59:46.800
that there's the next MacBook will only have one connector USB the new USB

59:46.800 --> 59:52.240
reversible C connector one connector one connector you guys okay I don't know if

59:52.240 --> 59:54.880
that's true or not but you could see a world where that happens and you know

59:54.880 --> 59:58.920
what it's still gonna sell the reality is it's still gonna sell and if Linux

59:58.920 --> 01:00:04.160
isn't there for it it's our loss yeah that's true you know and I also think

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:06.520
that you talked about that single connector you can guarantee there's

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.200
gonna be lots of add-on connectors so that you can adaptively connect other

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:16.820
legacy devices and whatnot yeah poppy did you see Lenovo's new x1 carbon

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:24.520
announced at CES yeah and the new x2 x0 series you know the 220 230 240

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:29.400
looks like they've gone back to the proper keyboard mm-hmm not the stupid

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:36.720
one that was on the x1 8 gigabyte max RAM yeah yeah which is stupid yes yes

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:41.080
yes no good that's entry-level these days really isn't it yeah yes I've got

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.400
virtual machines three doubles I have to get here okay go ahead so first I

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:49.800
boycott Apple products but to me this seems like it's possibly clinging to a

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.680
single example in order to move an opinion that this community tends to

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.360
lean toward other other examples I would say it was actually three examples but

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:07.400
yeah meeting to the fact that there was you know a caveat that their product was

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:12.760
aimed more towards power users which iPhone and iPad other similar mobiles

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:17.400
aren't you know what it really is I have a gut sense that I have a gut sense

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:22.840
that because when I have to sit down and use OS 10 I become very aware of

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:26.120
certain limitations that I think to myself anybody anybody who's sitting

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.200
there that just has a job to do you know you don't give a crap about with the

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.080
with the rest of the with the company's big overarching goals are it's really

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.720
none of your crap you know that's why I think honestly Ubuntu Mate edition is so

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:41.840
appealing to so many people because it is it is the representation of the idea

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:46.320
of the classical desktop before the vendors vision altered what the desktop

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:51.000
must look like so that way it matched their bold Steve Jobs Ian vision and I

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.640
think people are rebelling against that and that's why there's such a strong

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:57.960
appeal to Ubuntu Mate I think that same sort of undercurrent where

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:01.440
you're in OS 10 you feel like you're going against the grain you feel like

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:04.380
it's it's in an ecosystem that's not used for you you don't want any of the

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:09.240
native apps that is something that that it transcends a lot of people like

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:12.040
that's something that I think a lot of people will feel over time so that's

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:15.320
where some of this comes from but what we're citing is three examples Marco

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:22.600
Armit the Georgia Wozniak or whatever his name was and panic which is a huge

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:27.520
development shop for Mac and iOS so it is arbitrary examples but it's three

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:32.360
pretty pretty solid examples as far as examples go so there but there is an

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:36.440
angle that I actually liked just to bring some light to which is it seems

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:41.240
that people are forgetting one of the things that made Apple as successful as

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.440
they are now is exactly that they didn't have functionality and someone could

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.480
make money out of making that functionality maybe they're abusing on

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.080
the removed functionality and the people using to build things there are feeling

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:58.480
that pain however that's exactly what gives the money in the first place is

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.760
that the platform is lacking functionality they provide a core basis

01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.360
and they give you the grounds to start running and you start running and put

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.880
the functionality in and people buy that's why there's a market there what

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.520
actually makes it even difficult to get into Linux you have almost a version of

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.960
something always there and you have to be really good on the flip side did you

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:25.760
see that yesterday HP announced $180 stream PC that runs Windows it's like a

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.000
Chromebox for Windows and of course the number one question is how do you put

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.760
Linux on that and could that be maybe the ultimate new low-cost Windows

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.400
machine or Linux machine ships with Windows and like you know unfortunately

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.280
yes you're voting for Windows with that purchase but if you can pull it off and

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:43.640
make it a cheap Linux box that could be a nice little rig too I mean how much

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.400
better are you gonna get than some of the Intel looks especially the lower

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:51.400
priced ones like this it's just cheaper it's like $180 well I don't think they're

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:56.280
gonna risk selling this in Europe as many countries imply applied a law that

01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:01.120
allows you to avoid the Microsoft X you don't know how will they feel about it

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:06.840
avoid it no I don't think so I don't Italy Italy hacks least by its Supreme

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.840
Court ruled out that you cannot charge for the OS if the user rejects the

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.600
license so they actually have to refund Windows a few stories yeah I've heard a

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:20.160
few stories which actually works too which is really cool that's really

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:24.640
without it mr. corpse am I correct in in in

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.360
remembering that we have an interview with a mattei developer this weekend on

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:34.040
the Linux action show yes Stefano will be there well hey wimpy who is who is

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.400
Stefano will you tell the audience Stefano is the lead developer and

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.840
project lead for the Marte desktop and what should I ask him and he got you got

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:48.960
any burning questions oh boy I don't know ask him anything you like okay ask

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.320
him anything you like that'll be on Sunday's live access he's a super bloke

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.600
very friendly I'm looking forward to it a lot so and I think he's got good

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.320
timing alright well so that'll wrap up this week's episode of Linux unplugged

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.960
we've got links to the articles and blog posts that we discuss if you'd like to

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.120

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:59.600
tuning in this week's episode of unplugged see you next Tuesday

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:30.040
I wasn't gonna put in the show but you know where all these Mac users are

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:34.160
switching to don't you don't don't don't even doubt it they're switching to arch

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:40.200
and gnome 3 ah don't don't doubt it don't doubt it it's happening if our

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:45.600
Linux is to be believed at least according to the most recent package

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.120
survey stats for the Arch Linux project Firefox comes in at the number one

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.520
browser chromium comes in at number two nano is the number one editor VI at

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:59.160
number two the number one desktop on Arch Linux gnome 3 followed very closely

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:06.400
by KDE, XFCE, Cinnamon, LXDE, Mate and Enlightenment number one file manager no

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:15.800
not files or Nautilus since gnome nope then are there you go I wonder how

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:20.560
they're measuring that though I might have to dig into the gutter together yeah

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:23.680
you have to have the you have to have that voluntary I forget it's like Pac

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.800
Man stats or something like that there's like a standard yeah well there's two

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:31.120
things there's first of all you need that stats package installed which is

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:36.080
like the popularity contest on Debian and Ubuntu but also you have to nominate a

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:43.640
package that represents that something is installed so if Thunar is the

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:49.600
largest user base of file manager that kind of implies that XFCE is therefore

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.520
the largest desktop deployment and that could it be that what they're using to

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:59.280
measure the gnome shell installs is actually some generic thing very

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.120
possible would have on the system people just prefer Thunar because I kind of

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:10.560
prefer it who want it for the look like the lowest you know resources so they

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.760
feel like they're telling window managers like I well and here's why I

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.040
think it might have a leg up because definitely if I'm using KDE I'm

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:22.560
mandatory of Thunar because if I'm gonna connect to any SMB share I want that as

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.880
a GVS mount I do not like the way Dolphin handles SMB shares so the minute

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:31.720
I go do anything on my network I fire up Thunar so I think a lot of KDE desktops

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.280
probably use it for that reason too because it's a really easy way to get

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:43.360
you know a Samba mount on your SFTP master race yeah Eric is mobile and

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:49.280
opinionated JBtitles.com JBtitles.com everybody both see you mentioned that HP

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.800
device that was released earlier today yeah the steam PC or the stream PC

01:08:53.800 --> 01:09:02.320
sorry yeah this stream it is ugly ooh I like proprietary Exodus did you see

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:06.880
there did you see the silver and white one yeah that's still ugly yeah yeah it

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:13.040
does yeah it does you not order them with no OS installed from HP I don't

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:17.200
know no no no not these no not these stream PCs because I think Microsoft is

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:21.320
subsidizing part of the cost subsidy okay that's right yeah we've got a local

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:27.040
local computer vendor that sells the the genuine Intel NUCs and also like the

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:34.320
the gigabyte pocket which is a NUC style device yeah and the box does that when

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:38.840
you open it it's weird but they'll sell them without licenses so you can buy it

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:43.600
with no operating system they'll send you a form which looks very official

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:49.360
which says that you you waive certain things and that you you waive all of

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.040
your technical support with them because you want no operating system but you

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.320
fill out this form and they'll send you the stuff with no iOS on it that's cool

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:03.280
this thing is actually good on a Celeron so yeah anything you want well yeah how

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.760
do they lock you into it that's the question what are they doing to get you

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.440
to keep running Windows 8 there might be something I don't I don't like it I'm

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:14.520
probably missing something here but the seller on NUC is a hundred and forty

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:20.920
is it I thought it was I thought it was 200 no no 140 RAM is 22 bucks and you

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.040
can buy it you could use a compact flash cut 32 gigabyte compact flash card you

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:28.280
have the same thing except it's not you know it's not all pre-built it's not

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:32.000
from HP and the price is getting close but yeah I agree it doesn't look like

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.240
Tupperware I don't understand why the NUC doesn't sell more crazy I think I

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:42.720
think you got to put it together oh it's not that hard oh yeah people who are

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:46.320
buying are not gonna be wanting to do that yeah well okay you're buying them

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.000
like crazy at work let me put it to you this way anyone who's buying one of those

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.920
HP boxes to put Linux on it is it's gonna be easier to install RAM and a

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:57.000
hard drive and a NUC with the direction yeah way better it is to that's true by

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.560
that agent and then you can get out installing Linux on these things

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:14.320
probably know how to put a RAM and hard drive yeah well exactly
