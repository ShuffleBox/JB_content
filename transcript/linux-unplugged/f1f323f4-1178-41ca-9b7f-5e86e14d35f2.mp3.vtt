This is Linux Unplugged Episode 41 for May 20th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.760
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's digging through all of the

00:40.760 --> 00:46.680
quote-unquote big data. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey Matt. So this week by

00:46.680 --> 00:51.600
big data I mean we've got some results from the survey that we did last week in

00:51.600 --> 00:54.520
the Linux Unplugged show. We asked folks to chime in with their home server

00:54.520 --> 00:58.880
setups and I had some like I had some basic like do you have this installed do

00:58.880 --> 01:01.240
you have this installed and then I left like these fields for like leave some

01:01.240 --> 01:04.760
notes and that's where there's some really interesting stuff but I think

01:04.760 --> 01:08.960
some of the other things that stood out for me is the cloud versus home

01:08.960 --> 01:13.760
installation bias we'll talk more about that and then also just the massive

01:13.760 --> 01:18.080
amount of people that listed Arch as their home server distribution.

01:18.080 --> 01:22.760
Interesting. Which is funny. I'm not surprised. We just did an episode on that

01:22.760 --> 01:26.720
right? Yeah we did. And I thought maybe I was going out on a limb but turns out I'm

01:26.720 --> 01:32.640
behind it I'm behind the trend and we've also got the survey from our Linux the

01:32.640 --> 01:36.560
Linux subreddit they do like an annual survey and they got a brand new one that

01:36.560 --> 01:39.400
just came out it's actually it's getting to the size now where I think it's worth

01:39.400 --> 01:43.280
talking about they had over 10,000 respondents from all different walks of

01:43.280 --> 01:46.280
life on the Linux subreddit so we'll cover some of the results from that

01:46.280 --> 01:50.440
coming up in today's episode but first I wanted to tease a couple of things just

01:50.440 --> 01:54.040
let's just you know what like I'm just a hint bomb I'm gonna drop I haven't

01:54.040 --> 01:56.120
showed you this to you Max I wanted to surprise you on the show I don't know if

01:56.120 --> 02:00.040
you have the video stream up but just a little hint I do we have a little hint

02:00.040 --> 02:03.840
now on the video stream of where things are going with how to Linux there is

02:03.840 --> 02:09.560
chase Eric and I down in downtown Seattle on the beautiful Kerry at the

02:09.560 --> 02:13.760
beautiful Kerry Park which is like the most picturesque version of Seattle you

02:13.760 --> 02:18.680
have ever seen it's gorgeous so I won't say what we were doing but there might

02:18.680 --> 02:23.360
have been some shenanigans happening yesterday some scenery some selfies you

02:23.360 --> 02:26.760
know just some weird you know we were we were kind of making asses of ourselves

02:26.760 --> 02:29.360
to be honest with you because it's a pretty busy park because it's so iconic

02:29.360 --> 02:33.920
you know it's so like it's so like classic Seattle yeah and when there we

02:33.920 --> 02:38.480
were kind of goofing around and people were actually to be true to be truthful

02:38.480 --> 02:43.280
about it very patient with us because for the most part I mean every now and

02:43.280 --> 02:46.160
then there was like some dog shenanigans going on and things like that and some

02:46.160 --> 02:52.560
dog fights and and we sometimes like the reflector would fly away and go towards

02:52.560 --> 02:59.240
a crowd of people yeah that was a possibility too so but it was funny gosh

02:59.240 --> 03:02.520
it was a gorgeous day yesterday it's gorgeous day here today as well but

03:02.520 --> 03:06.560
that's so yeah boy I just tell you what man that was that was some nice

03:06.560 --> 03:09.200
shooting but that's not actually all this morning I wanted to talk about

03:09.200 --> 03:13.520
before we get rolling I also have see if you can guess see I'll try to do it

03:13.520 --> 03:16.600
before you see the video version on the stream see if you can guess what I have

03:16.600 --> 03:24.040
in my hot little hands by this audio tone can you guess what I have in my

03:24.040 --> 03:34.600
hands no that's the Intel sound man yes yeah I got the we just got it in studio

03:34.600 --> 03:41.840
today this morning the Intel NUC D 5 4 2 5 0 W Y K H rolls right off the tongue

03:41.840 --> 03:45.680
that's a gorgeous piece of hardware yeah this so this is the I wish I had my

03:45.680 --> 03:51.120
box to join you this is the fatter NUC this this is a big fat on it's and the

03:51.120 --> 03:56.640
reason for that is it can take a standard size SSD you know two and a

03:56.640 --> 04:00.520
half inch SSD instead of that PCI little card you have to use so and it's not

04:00.520 --> 04:04.880
that much bigger to be honest with you but now yeah so we're gonna have a

04:04.880 --> 04:07.840
little this is gonna be a little dedicated Skype machine so we can do

04:07.840 --> 04:11.880
some fancier Skype stuff here in JB one and you know we were really kind of like

04:11.880 --> 04:15.280
okay how do we want to do this what is the best way to accomplish what we want

04:15.280 --> 04:19.080
to do and the at the end of it it was like because we already had the SSD on

04:19.080 --> 04:27.040
on-site it really meant all-in for a core i5 rig with I think it's I think we

04:27.040 --> 04:32.920
get eight gigs or 16 gigs I can't remember eight gigs I think it was like

04:32.920 --> 04:38.280
400 bucks from Amazon yeah 460 or something like that total and it's gonna

04:38.280 --> 04:42.240
make you know it's just perfect for Skype it's it's small Rekai calls it

04:42.240 --> 04:46.000
the glue of the studio cuz now we've got this is our second one and I believe it

04:46.000 --> 04:49.760
these little it's just so much it's so much power in a little compact machine

04:49.760 --> 04:54.400
and Linux is such a slam dunk on the NUC it's just really easy cuz it's all

04:54.400 --> 05:00.360
Intel parts how much do they got well that one that one is yeah like also all

05:00.360 --> 05:04.080
set after we bought the RAM and everything was like 460 or 480 something

05:04.080 --> 05:08.220
like that but that's pretty good this is my five right yeah that's an i5 laptop

05:08.220 --> 05:12.880
i5 with yeah but it has like the virtualization stuff yeah it's just a

05:12.880 --> 05:17.220
really low undervolted underclock yeah I mean you get really low TDP yeah don't

05:17.220 --> 05:20.240
get the most performance like you would if you went with a desktop i3 you you

05:20.240 --> 05:23.640
know we get the same feature set just a little bit less performance but it can

05:23.640 --> 05:27.400
turbo up there sometimes if it's not overheating yeah the one we've got now

05:27.400 --> 05:34.480
in in production is usually around you know 1.8 gigahertz for each core which

05:34.480 --> 05:38.440
for doing for doing HD Skype is more than enough it's really more than enough

05:38.440 --> 05:41.960
so it's it's it's great or you know mumble or whatever that's gonna be

05:41.960 --> 05:45.760
essentially like another call-in box that way we can take multiple Skype

05:45.760 --> 05:49.120
video calls and things like that essentially like the communication hub

05:49.120 --> 05:54.320
yeah and so having something that is low profile quiet like that and so

05:54.320 --> 05:57.640
eventually the other nice thing is we can essentially add more I'm just we'll

05:57.640 --> 06:01.160
just get a little shelf and put them on there and they have HDMI directly out

06:01.160 --> 06:05.480
that goes into the capture machine they have one audio out port and then we use

06:05.480 --> 06:09.360
one of the USB ports to add a USB sound card which we would do anyways so they're

06:09.360 --> 06:12.280
pretty nice little machines so the one that I'm showing the picture on the

06:12.280 --> 06:17.200
live stream is a nut too and this is an arch box run in gnome 312 and it's just

06:17.200 --> 06:21.280
it's it's great it's it's sometimes needs restarted I've noticed that

06:21.280 --> 06:23.600
sometimes these knocks need to be rebooted I don't know what's up with

06:23.600 --> 06:27.200
that I don't know if it's the Intel driver or what have you updated the

06:27.200 --> 06:31.400
firmware chiptap I don't know I don't think so oh because they don't or at

06:31.400 --> 06:34.520
least mine never came with updated firmware so when I got it I updated them

06:34.520 --> 06:37.680
and it seems to be better after about David Rick I might have you know the

06:37.680 --> 06:43.600
thing what we've noticed is the HDMI audio out after like about 24 48 hours

06:43.600 --> 06:47.800
starts to get crackly oh see I don't use the audio at all in mine so I wouldn't

06:47.800 --> 06:50.800
know so maybe that's why I haven't noticed Rekha says he did update the

06:50.800 --> 06:55.360
firmware yeah well what's cool about it is so so so they have an audio out jack

06:55.360 --> 07:00.000
plus then we have the USB sound card so that we can like you know so we have

07:00.000 --> 07:04.840
this so audio comes in over USB or goes out depending on the setup and then we

07:04.840 --> 07:08.800
also have an audio out over HDMI and because it's the Intel Iris graphics the

07:08.800 --> 07:14.980
driver works pretty much flawlessly so after your base install of even you know

07:14.980 --> 07:18.480
and it makes an arch setup super simple after your bachins base install you've

07:18.480 --> 07:25.040
got working HDMI mirroring with audio signal so for us that means one wire to

07:25.040 --> 07:29.380
the capture machine and we can get the desktop picture and the sound from the

07:29.380 --> 07:33.080
machine without having to run any other wires which leaves those other audio

07:33.080 --> 07:36.640
interfaces available for other things and so it it's it's a great combination

07:36.640 --> 07:40.960
I really am impressed with these boxes and I think I wonder why Intel is the

07:40.960 --> 07:43.600
only one selling these because it seems like people could be relabeling these

07:43.600 --> 07:48.920
maybe people are oh I think like gigabyte does so yeah gigabyte uses a

07:48.920 --> 07:51.600
more powerful chip in the brain yeah and then you have that company that makes

07:51.600 --> 07:55.320
the orange box they also do a whole line of nick things yeah those guys figure

07:55.320 --> 08:01.160
what they're called no I'm not they have an i3 version that's only 299 or 289 yes

08:01.160 --> 08:05.040
yeah they do yeah I went with the higher processor just so that way we have a

08:05.040 --> 08:08.480
little more flexibility what we use it for right because a lot of times thinking

08:08.480 --> 08:12.040
for me I maybe just get the cheap yeah you know it'd be great for like a

08:12.040 --> 08:16.120
visuals machine for BSD now because it's super small and it's just out of the way

08:16.120 --> 08:21.440
and I went with the i5 because here in the studio I have found that every

08:21.440 --> 08:24.160
piece of gear ends up getting used for all kinds of different stuff that you

08:24.160 --> 08:28.800
would never expect it and and so I try to just sort of hedge my bets when I'm

08:28.800 --> 08:32.360
buying studio equipment and I err on the side of more power so that way when it

08:32.360 --> 08:35.840
ends up doing something I never planned for it's a capable for doing the job but

08:35.840 --> 08:39.560
if you would like this is always gonna be email web you know it's it's it's

08:39.560 --> 08:42.320
always gonna do like maybe one VM something like that you could go lower

08:42.320 --> 08:47.160
power I think oh yeah I can think of so many uses for those boxes yeah so many

08:47.160 --> 08:50.800
yeah I think calling them the glue is a good description and you know I've seen

08:50.800 --> 08:54.840
some pushback on our coverage of the Ubuntu orange box people are like this

08:54.840 --> 08:57.360
is like there's a thread right now in the subreddit it's like what's the

08:57.360 --> 09:02.000
actual use case for something like this I I think people undersell the NUC and I

09:02.000 --> 09:06.640
think I think it's I think that's why I maybe it's because I've had so many good

09:06.640 --> 09:10.400
experiences with the NUC now I started off feeling like it was a finicky

09:10.400 --> 09:13.800
device and I still think there's some I think still has some esoteric rough

09:13.800 --> 09:18.780
edges but I think it's I think it's gonna revolutionize some production

09:18.780 --> 09:24.320
stuff it's what one of my opinion all on the NUC NUC is a great workstation it

09:24.320 --> 09:27.720
could be a great media center but at the end of the day it's not gonna make a

09:27.720 --> 09:31.280
good data center you can actually exactly a whole portable data center

09:31.280 --> 09:37.640
with that Ubuntu orange box yeah that's just what I'm seeing yeah I could use

09:37.640 --> 09:41.960
that yeah exactly for a data center there's something like the the super

09:41.960 --> 09:47.080
micro iCloud it's like three use and fits ten i3s and it's probably more

09:47.080 --> 09:52.000
practical yeah Alan what I'm talking about is basically people who want to

09:52.000 --> 09:56.560
build their own data center and don't have that much space so right well three

09:56.560 --> 10:01.720
uses enough only like three pizza boxes well yeah that's true you know it's

10:01.720 --> 10:05.120
heavier and harder to carry around whereas the orange box has those carry

10:05.120 --> 10:09.200
handles and stuffs it's super portable in that case so you can take one of

10:09.200 --> 10:13.640
those data center and a truck those half-use sleds and put one in a case like the Nuc

10:13.640 --> 10:18.040
is but it's sorry the orange box rather is but well there were a bunch of places

10:18.040 --> 10:22.520
I used to do this with Mac Mini's I was just gonna say that do that I was just

10:22.520 --> 10:26.800
gonna say the Mac Mini they're still around it's Mac Mini polo dot net I

10:26.800 --> 10:31.160
still haven't made the money back yeah you go Matt you send him a power PC Mac

10:31.160 --> 10:35.360
Mini and you could run things the power on those I mean like because they're

10:35.360 --> 10:39.040
really they weren't powerful but they were real consistent I don't know how to

10:39.040 --> 10:41.760
describe that better they just the power something about the power piece oh the

10:41.760 --> 10:45.800
power PC chip was solid yeah I thought that was a great machine I agree and I

10:45.800 --> 10:49.680
couldn't bring myself to throw it away yeah yeah why am I looking at buying a

10:49.680 --> 10:55.440
NUC right now I'm supposed to be having dinner I'll tell you about something

10:55.440 --> 10:58.520
else you should consider buying because it's mobile that makes sense and that's

10:58.520 --> 11:03.160
our first sponsor this week that is Ting head over to linux.ting.com shout it

11:03.160 --> 11:08.080
proud my friends linux.ting.com that tells them that you appreciate them

11:08.080 --> 11:11.600
supporting the Linux unplugged podcast and that you're willing to take a couple

11:11.600 --> 11:15.480
of minutes and check out their service as a thank you for keeping us on the

11:15.480 --> 11:18.480
air but here's why you'd want to go there once you're there you'll you'll be

11:18.480 --> 11:24.640
amazed at Ting because it's no contract mobile and you only pay for what you use

11:24.640 --> 11:28.320
it's a flat six dollars per month and then it's just taxes and your usage on

11:28.320 --> 11:33.680
top of that so like in my case I have two phones on my Ting account and I end

11:33.680 --> 11:38.200
up paying a very very low rate because both myself and Rekai who's the other

11:38.200 --> 11:42.320
person on my account are very smart about our data usage we're primarily Wi-Fi

11:42.320 --> 11:45.320
users because we're pretty much either here at the studio or somewhere else that

11:45.320 --> 11:48.600
has Wi-Fi and then you know of course when I'm driving I'm careful with that

11:48.600 --> 11:53.480
that makes my monthly bill with two phones generally unless we have a big

11:53.480 --> 11:56.320
day where we have to tether or something like that for you know several days in

11:56.320 --> 11:59.560
row and Comcast is totally biting the dust you know that because that'll go up

11:59.560 --> 12:03.640
a little bit but even in that scenario it was like forty four dollars for two

12:03.640 --> 12:08.760
smartphones that's for a Nexus 5 and an HTC one and that's with everything picture

12:08.760 --> 12:12.400
picture messaging hotspot tethering included with that plan it's just use

12:12.400 --> 12:16.120
it's just your usage they bail they bill on the usage not on the gimmick and

12:16.120 --> 12:20.240
that's what makes Ting stand out so go to linux.ting.com because that's gonna

12:20.240 --> 12:25.120
take $25 off your first device and they've got a whole new slew of devices

12:25.120 --> 12:30.680
including the beautiful HTC one m8 that is unquestionably one of the best

12:30.680 --> 12:34.160
Android phones on the market now one of the big improvements they made over the

12:34.160 --> 12:37.120
HTC one is considerable battery improvements which I think is awesome

12:37.120 --> 12:40.000
and a little sleeker design of course and a few other things they've got

12:40.000 --> 12:44.960
Samsung Galaxy s5 as well they have new mid-range and entry-level phones and I

12:44.960 --> 12:50.120
was taking a look at the Moto X on Ting check this out you buy this Moto X if

12:50.120 --> 12:54.120
you go to linux.ting.com it's gonna cost you three hundred and fifty six dollars

12:54.120 --> 12:57.840
that's an unlocked phone that you own that you're only paying for the usage

12:57.840 --> 13:01.680
you're not in a contract it's $356 that's not the cost where they're

13:01.680 --> 13:04.920
spreading it out over a two-year contract without and gouge you that's

13:04.920 --> 13:09.280
you pay it and you're done and then it's just what you use after that for a

13:09.280 --> 13:13.040
Motorola X and some folks say this is one of the best Android phones ever made

13:13.040 --> 13:17.480
that's unbelievable so go over to linux.ting.com and check out what they've

13:17.480 --> 13:21.160
got to offer and try out their savings calculator put your current bill in

13:21.160 --> 13:24.800
there and then check out the difference and tell me you couldn't go get

13:24.800 --> 13:28.080
yourself a new computer every couple of years on that money you'd save it was

13:28.080 --> 13:33.980
unbelievable for me linux.ting.com and a really big thank you to ting for

13:33.980 --> 13:40.720
sponsoring Linux unplugged getting us into our 40s Matt it's so crazy all

13:40.720 --> 13:43.920
right hard to believe we're in the 40s already I mean it's like where'd that go

13:43.920 --> 13:48.720
I know right that really did go fast so I'm just reposting in the chat room

13:48.720 --> 13:53.220
right now a Google Doc that's it oh hi that's the problem oh you're the problem

13:53.220 --> 13:58.840
you are the Samsung can be hi we were discussing a side conversation well

13:58.840 --> 14:02.600
we're back I'll let you finish it up in the post show sorry I just jumped right

14:02.600 --> 14:06.760
back in I just posted in the chat room if you guys want to take a look at it to

14:06.760 --> 14:10.240
the survey results the Google spreadsheet results from the home

14:10.240 --> 14:15.180
server survey that we did last episode and rocks like everybody has a home

14:15.180 --> 14:20.320
server yeah seriously yeah so rotten I don't what what jumped out at you

14:20.320 --> 14:25.440
initially when you looked at the results the majority of people using the home

14:25.440 --> 14:29.960
for their home server is heavily in backups and media for likes file storage

14:29.960 --> 14:35.680
like media servers and stuff like that but also it's a lot of hate against

14:35.680 --> 14:40.120
using cloud services yeah it was sort of well go ahead that's pretty easy to

14:40.120 --> 14:45.400
explain the average user has like what a megabit of upload baby yeah even even

14:45.400 --> 14:50.900
high-end people like me only have five megabits of upload yeah well try to

14:50.900 --> 14:56.360
upload a couple of terabytes that way well there's other uses in just in file

14:56.360 --> 15:00.480
storage and back yeah yeah right so you know I like knowing where my stuff is

15:00.480 --> 15:04.120
and I this was a home server survey but that jumped out at me too rotten when I

15:04.120 --> 15:08.920
was looking through this essentially like out of out of how many do we get a

15:08.920 --> 15:13.600
hundred and what was it I think hundred fifty five respondents hundred fifty

15:13.600 --> 15:20.000
eight respondents like two of them are using like a host somewhere to be their

15:20.000 --> 15:24.240
home server and like VPN into it and in like both cases like it's because of bit

15:24.240 --> 15:28.000
torrent sync and maybe like plex or maybe more than two but it's like almost

15:28.000 --> 15:31.880
just two and in in all cases where they're using cloud hosting it's for bit

15:31.880 --> 15:37.800
torrent sync and in some cases plex and I was I was surprised it was that strong

15:37.800 --> 15:41.600
of a difference because it's there was a huge standout what about you it what

15:41.600 --> 15:44.480
stuck it what stood out to you when you were looking at the results you know

15:44.480 --> 15:50.720
actually I I see a lot of flex when I look at these results yes a lot of media

15:50.720 --> 15:56.080
serving yeah couch potato and some other stuff I've never even heard of like sick

15:56.080 --> 15:59.280
beard oh yeah well we covered sick beard recently but that does seem to be really

15:59.280 --> 16:03.520
popular yeah which is good it's good and it's ab nzb which kind of goes along with

16:03.520 --> 16:06.760
six beard sick beard and I didn't participate in the survey but a lot of

16:06.760 --> 16:13.680
these people and I are in perfect sync like that with bit torrent sync you know

16:13.680 --> 16:20.720
I use all the time yeah and plex yeah and network backup I a few folks are

16:20.720 --> 16:24.120
using tiny tiny RSS which makes me happy because I think that's a good project

16:24.120 --> 16:29.240
and it was a great Google reader replacement use that as well you know

16:29.240 --> 16:34.200
what jumped out to it jumped out at me is not as much own cloud as I expected

16:34.200 --> 16:38.040
there is definitely a fair amount of own cloud representation but not quite as

16:38.040 --> 16:42.040
much that's just because you know in my opinion I've talked about this before

16:42.040 --> 16:47.640
it's a pain in the butt to set up and then once it does get set up it's like

16:47.640 --> 16:50.840
sometimes it screws up and maybe that's just the database back end or something

16:50.840 --> 16:55.160
I just honestly don't know but yeah there's a lot less own cloud I see one

16:55.160 --> 16:59.400
or two things of own cloud on here but not much I like some of these that some

16:59.400 --> 17:02.920
of these guys gave us a total like like a list out of their drives and all that

17:02.920 --> 17:06.720
kind of stuff if you are considering jumping into a server and you want to

17:06.720 --> 17:09.520
see some of this stuff this is a really good resource we'll have it linked in

17:09.520 --> 17:13.280
the show notes here's an example of somebody who has a DVR running on fedora

17:13.280 --> 17:16.840
20 but he's planning to change it to archie says 2 terabyte hard drive 4

17:16.840 --> 17:22.560
gigs of RAM he's got myth TV subsonic xbmc plex and of course SSH so many

17:22.560 --> 17:29.840
folks so many folks using plex so many plex users very dominant there's also a

17:29.840 --> 17:35.080
lot more arch than I would expect it yes and you know what a lot more arch

17:35.080 --> 17:41.120
almost almost a majority of arch and also a few mentions of free BSD in here

17:41.120 --> 17:50.960
and a lot of free NAS too so here's a good one I liked this one this guy's got

17:50.960 --> 17:55.560
sab nzb couch potato plex uses his network backup and then a git annex

17:55.560 --> 17:59.480
which a git server is a really good idea he says I think the main importance for

17:59.480 --> 18:02.400
the NAS will be enough storage being able to put whatever I would like on

18:02.400 --> 18:09.080
there he says I do monthly ZFS scrubs I do snapshots every day with the ZFS

18:09.080 --> 18:13.400
tools and then I use ZFS send to send my data to another storage device in

18:13.400 --> 18:17.040
another place which I thought was really good he said he likes to do our sinks

18:17.040 --> 18:22.360
for simple backups duplicity for Windows duplications and BUP BUP one of the best

18:22.360 --> 18:25.720
backup utilities out there which sounds familiar but I haven't checked it out I

18:25.720 --> 18:33.440
don't think really cool results I really liked going through this and yeah like

18:33.440 --> 18:38.720
other people have picked up on arch really stood out in in this survey arch

18:38.720 --> 18:43.280
really stood out and I wanted to talk about that a little bit because we just

18:43.280 --> 18:46.520
did us we just did an episode about building the ultimate home server on

18:46.520 --> 18:51.480
arch and before we went on the air I thought maybe I would get a lot of

18:51.480 --> 18:58.440
feedback that I was crazy I was being too on the edge I I was using a toy

18:58.440 --> 19:02.200
operating system for a serious task and I was being irresponsible it's honestly

19:02.200 --> 19:05.400
what I I kind of projected what I thought if I was looking into what the

19:05.400 --> 19:11.320
future what I thought the feedback was gonna be and I would say overall it has

19:11.320 --> 19:15.240
been very positive we had a very good response to Sunday's episode the

19:15.240 --> 19:18.600
ultimate you know a home server arch home server the arch home server

19:18.600 --> 19:23.160
challenge that we did and this the survey results here which is funny I

19:23.160 --> 19:26.400
didn't I didn't want to look at this before I did the episode because I

19:26.400 --> 19:29.400
didn't want to like cheat and like do oh that looked cool I want to do that I

19:29.400 --> 19:32.640
wanted to build the thing I wanted to build and then follow up this on Tuesday

19:32.640 --> 19:35.960
so when I opened this up this morning to look at this I was kind of floored and

19:35.960 --> 19:39.320
then combined with all of the really positive feedback that we got and a lot

19:39.320 --> 19:44.640
of folks saying yeah I run arch 2 that was sort of revealing to me and I

19:44.640 --> 19:48.920
thought I've been wondering if maybe you and I just sort of happened to

19:48.920 --> 19:52.920
serendipitously and thanks to the chat room as I've been reminded to point out

19:52.920 --> 19:58.120
switch to arch it's sort of a time when arch is reaching sort of a mass momentum

19:58.120 --> 20:04.200
and despite I think so yeah and despite how hard the arch project seems to try

20:04.200 --> 20:08.760
to make it hard for people to adopt it seems to somehow keep happening and then

20:08.760 --> 20:15.760
we just got these results of the 2014 reddit linux subreddit is that hey yeah

20:15.760 --> 20:18.840
the subreddit for the linux art is like what our slash linux yeah our slash

20:18.840 --> 20:24.000
linux subreddit and they've done these for a while but a couple of years ago it

20:24.000 --> 20:28.440
was taken over by somebody new and I think he's been doing a good job with

20:28.440 --> 20:31.000
this and so I wanted to cover his results and chat with you guys about

20:31.000 --> 20:36.320
this and you know I mean these are just these were results they were posted on

20:36.320 --> 20:41.920
a subreddit they made it sticky for a while you know so I take it for what it

20:41.920 --> 20:51.320
is they had 10,292 respondents which is up from 7,698 last year and the year

20:51.320 --> 20:59.000
before that it was 4,932 so a lot of growth and it seems our linux itself has

20:59.000 --> 21:03.520
grown a lot in the last year so you combine the growth of linux itself with

21:03.520 --> 21:06.840
the with the linux subreddit and then the fact that the mod stick it it they

21:06.840 --> 21:11.440
had some pretty good results and so they asked folks do you use linux on

21:11.440 --> 21:15.680
non-server computers and of course like 96 of their respondents 96% of the

21:15.680 --> 21:19.600
respondents yes because they're in the subreddit do you use and then they asked

21:19.600 --> 21:23.800
them do you run linux on any of your server computers and 58% of people

21:23.800 --> 21:29.520
responded yes when they asked for fun or profit for fun 66% of people for profit

21:29.520 --> 21:34.360
27% of people so that's all kind of interesting but what I thought really

21:34.360 --> 21:39.280
stood out is this next survey question what linux distro distro do you

21:39.280 --> 21:44.920
primarily use on your non server computer what is the out of all 10,000

21:44.920 --> 21:50.080
respondents what is the number one distribution arch not Ubuntu it's arch

21:50.080 --> 21:57.880
it's arch linux 64% on the server 36% on the desktop overall I just thought that

21:57.880 --> 22:01.280
was pretty stand out here's a couple of bits of differences Debian has replaced

22:01.280 --> 22:04.960
linux mint for position number three elementary OS has quickly gained a

22:04.960 --> 22:08.920
following putting in position number six Zubuntu has dropped to position number

22:08.920 --> 22:14.080
seven after elementary OS and crunchbang has risen above kubuntu and gen 2 for

22:14.080 --> 22:17.200
position number eight and kubuntu has dropped off the top ten making it in

22:17.200 --> 22:22.680
position 11 now I don't know about you guys but my gut for some reason gives

22:22.680 --> 22:27.280
more credence to this survey then the top ten results on distro watch no

22:27.280 --> 22:30.600
disrespect to the distro watch folks but for some reason distro watch is based

22:30.600 --> 22:34.800
on just clicks on their website it's very right right and this seems like I

22:34.800 --> 22:39.160
mean I don't have a strong impression of the user base of our Linux but it seems

22:39.160 --> 22:43.480
to be a wide mix and in fact if anything I would have labeled them as anti arch

22:43.480 --> 22:47.160
Linux to tell you the truth I would have said they kind of hate on arch a lot in

22:47.160 --> 22:52.160
the I disagree I think I think that they're I think you're definitely gonna

22:52.160 --> 23:02.320
have a mix but I would say they're more anti boon to I've seen like a bigger

23:02.320 --> 23:06.000
group of purists for sure but they're definitely pretty pretty set in their

23:06.000 --> 23:09.560
ways yeah also they should have looked at the the survey should have also

23:09.560 --> 23:14.160
included the the basis so they should tell you like elementary OS is based on

23:14.160 --> 23:19.160
a bunch of so they should point out like how much space in a bunch of yeah well

23:19.160 --> 23:22.120
then you lost this place because of fragmentation possible well you could

23:22.120 --> 23:26.560
make that same argument about Debbie and then sure but it's more I think it's

23:26.560 --> 23:30.560
there's the the more important part is that they they did the survey for like

23:30.560 --> 23:36.040
people to fill out the survey like three weeks before Ubuntu released 1404 yes

23:36.040 --> 23:39.640
and that would have skewed the results massively in that pay in that way well

23:39.640 --> 23:42.440
they should have it should have skewed the results towards Ubuntu because the

23:42.440 --> 23:45.920
Ubuntu hype was at an all-time high before the 1404 but people weren't

23:45.920 --> 23:48.400
using it it was asking what are you currently using people are probably

23:48.400 --> 23:52.000
waiting to use it well I know I would think they'd be using a book do don't

23:52.000 --> 23:55.200
you think and don't you think more Ubuntu users would be trolling the our

23:55.200 --> 23:58.640
Linux subreddit for news about the Ubuntu release than normal and there's

23:58.640 --> 24:02.200
a lot of people who went from there's people who went from arch to 1404 and

24:02.200 --> 24:05.320
have been using it for a while there's even a couple blog posts about it but I

24:05.320 --> 24:10.160
know it's just it's not that it's saying that they it's just the timing was

24:10.160 --> 24:14.120
where they could have waited a month I don't know I I think if anything doing a

24:14.120 --> 24:18.680
survey as the weeks leading up to the next major release of anything gives

24:18.680 --> 24:22.080
more attention to Ubuntu and it's getting if anything I think that's

24:22.080 --> 24:26.720
actually more of an indictment of the poor showing of Ubuntu hmm but I could

24:26.720 --> 24:30.880
be wrong our could be nothing you know all of this could mean nothing let's

24:30.880 --> 24:34.240
keep that in mind here's I want a couple more things just to just as for us to

24:34.240 --> 24:40.600
chew on what Linux distro distro you primarily use on your non server

24:40.600 --> 24:44.920
computers so this is fun versus profit number one distribution people use for

24:44.920 --> 24:50.620
fun arch Linux no surprise there when it comes to profit only 15% of them use

24:50.620 --> 24:55.100
arch which is not too surprising Debian does a strong showing at 23% as does

24:55.100 --> 25:02.320
fedora for profit 28% fedora came in at number two for fun at 71% now what did

25:02.320 --> 25:08.440
what other Linux distro do you use on your non server computers Debian played

25:08.440 --> 25:12.720
showed very strong here followed by Ubuntu and arch Linux but through this

25:12.720 --> 25:16.400
whole thing arch does really good now here's here's an interesting one more

25:16.400 --> 25:20.400
people using Linux on laptops than on desktops not by a huge huge number but

25:20.400 --> 25:25.480
by by a pretty good number with that that number though because he set it up

25:25.480 --> 25:29.840
where it was laptops and tablets are the same answer yeah but who's running who's

25:29.840 --> 25:33.400
running Linux on the tablet people could be considering Android or you know a

25:33.400 --> 25:37.920
bunch of touch yeah yeah but you know it does kind of get to the point where I do

25:37.920 --> 25:43.320
run Linux on my laptop but I also run Windows on my gaming desktop for those

25:43.320 --> 25:48.880
windows right games right yeah I think there's some folks that do that so yeah

25:48.880 --> 25:52.560
Debian it's interesting too for server distributions Debian was the top

25:52.560 --> 25:57.520
followed by Ubuntu then sent OS number three then arch in number four or it's

25:57.520 --> 26:02.440
Linux at number four then followed by right at Enterprise Linux that's that's

26:02.440 --> 26:06.640
got to be because of the demo that's got to be the demo I would think yeah

26:06.640 --> 26:09.840
although just because they make the most money doesn't mean they have the largest

26:09.840 --> 26:13.840
install base and then which Linux distro do you primarily use on your

26:13.840 --> 26:17.240
server computers fun versus profit Debian again is up there now I thought

26:17.240 --> 26:22.600
that was kind of funny too they get into the desktop scene and they ask folks

26:22.600 --> 26:29.800
like what desktop and what's your favorite Linux GUI gnome 3 really no

26:29.800 --> 26:36.400
wow that surprised me yeah yeah well I actually went and arched it and

26:36.400 --> 26:44.600
put the good man on it I am too yeah I'm doing gnome 3 on the ultra pro right now

26:44.600 --> 26:49.840
and I love it it's growing on me I'm actually a big fan of gnome 3 except is

26:49.840 --> 26:55.120
it mutter yeah mutter is the it's not it's not working very well for me so

26:55.120 --> 26:59.720
I've had a few crashes just because of mutter and so it may be kind of locked

26:59.720 --> 27:03.640
me down and not be nice gnome 3 yeah yeah but as when I did use it it's it's

27:03.640 --> 27:09.440
pretty awesome Katie Katie that's number two oh go ahead there Devlin make your

27:09.440 --> 27:14.600
point yeah that actually makes me question now that we've been seeing like

27:14.600 --> 27:20.840
the cutie and GTK fight going on if gnome shell is gnome trees being so

27:20.840 --> 27:26.520
successful in terms of usage in desktop wouldn't that mean that kind of GTK 3 at

27:26.520 --> 27:30.640
least is getting some attention there yeah I mean maybe this momentum will

27:30.640 --> 27:35.280
keep them relevant so what what do you guys think what is the most hated Linux

27:35.280 --> 27:45.560
graphical environment any guesses unity by a freaking ginormous margin ginormous

27:45.560 --> 27:51.720
margin which honestly feels a little unfair in fact he even points out that

27:51.720 --> 27:59.280
the hate for unity is actually up over previous years so now I think that

27:59.280 --> 28:04.040
improves so much well that comes to people more people being exposed to it

28:04.040 --> 28:08.880
now because it's it's in the mainline version go ahead there is the second

28:08.880 --> 28:13.920
most what I see here is like it seems like the power users that being are the

28:13.920 --> 28:17.000
ones that are actually actively in these communities and participating on the

28:17.000 --> 28:21.960
voting and stuff and the result is that those are the users that feel that they

28:21.960 --> 28:26.720
got kind of left out yeah the newest choices right and as a result it goes

28:26.720 --> 28:35.360
back to yep pretty much yeah you got it and let me tell you something else I

28:35.360 --> 28:39.560
think what this shows you is and this is my this is my connection here but I

28:39.560 --> 28:43.000
think one of the reasons why arch is seeing such strong performance is

28:43.000 --> 28:46.640
because it's a great distribution to run gnome and what's the number one desktop

28:46.640 --> 28:50.160
everybody loves gnome so what do people run on their desktops in this survey

28:50.160 --> 28:54.520
arch what's the number one desktop environment they're using gnome so it is

28:54.520 --> 28:58.520
interesting that because nobody even though fedora does a pretty good job

28:58.520 --> 29:03.920
nobody has gotten off their dumb asses to make a good gnome 3 implementation so

29:03.920 --> 29:09.880
arch is eating their lunch in the power users and I think I think we as Linux

29:09.880 --> 29:13.840
users need to change our perspective because we always talk about these

29:13.840 --> 29:18.200
magical pony new users who show up from magical land and just want to say please

29:18.200 --> 29:23.120
sir give me some Linux because that's of course how new users operate so we're

29:23.120 --> 29:27.480
always talking about these mythical new users and in reality it is those of us

29:27.480 --> 29:33.040
who've been running Linux for over a decade now that are still here we're

29:33.040 --> 29:37.920
still relevant we're still buying products and guess what we like gnome we

29:37.920 --> 29:42.120
like arch Linux because we have evolved our tastes over time not all of us and

29:42.120 --> 29:47.440
I'm not disparaging anybody who hasn't but I think there is a vast majority of

29:47.440 --> 29:52.360
longtime Linux users who are sick of the distribution crap and politics they want

29:52.360 --> 29:56.280
these kids off their lawn they just want to get a good damn desktop use the

29:56.280 --> 30:00.360
latest software and that's what they want to do all day long and let the kids

30:00.360 --> 30:04.120
fight it out they can go do whatever they need to do and personally maybe I'm

30:04.120 --> 30:07.320
just bringing my own baggage into this but I think I might be representing a

30:07.320 --> 30:12.440
large crowd here and I think these numbers might back that up what do you

30:12.440 --> 30:18.760
guys think I don't think it's your own your baggage I mean when gnome shell

30:18.760 --> 30:22.800
started came out people were bashing at it I looked at what they were trying to

30:22.800 --> 30:26.960
achieve and it pleased me I didn't like the implementation at the moment so I

30:26.960 --> 30:31.680
didn't jump right right away to using it but yeah that's how I was to know

30:31.680 --> 30:37.320
crossroads crossroads do you uh what do you think do you think this is a me

30:37.320 --> 30:45.040
bearing my own baggage well the thing about no gnome 3 and are just arch

30:45.040 --> 30:50.200
doesn't really do a lot there I mean the whole thing is you know upstream and all

30:50.200 --> 30:54.480
that kind of stuff but Fedora really pushes gnome a great example of this is

30:54.480 --> 31:00.600
gnome software still does not run on arch because package kit on official

31:00.600 --> 31:05.640
arch repos is zero dot seven dot six and gnome software requires zero dot eight

31:05.640 --> 31:12.400
dot one I think yeah and it doesn't build as I've tried I can't I can't get

31:12.400 --> 31:19.560
it to build and so it really it's Fedora is pushing gnome Fedora is the epitome

31:19.560 --> 31:23.680
of gnome all right Colonel Linux why don't you play devil's advocate for me

31:23.680 --> 31:28.680
so I don't disagree with what you're saying yeah you make a very good point

31:28.680 --> 31:34.720
but what but taking that attitude of you know we're the power users and and and

31:34.720 --> 31:39.960
cater to us that's great for one desktop and and we have that but that I think

31:39.960 --> 31:44.200
where these companies like canonical are coming in where they're trying to craft

31:44.200 --> 31:51.600
the the unity desktop is we want to want to further we want to spread the idea of

31:51.600 --> 31:54.840
Linux and new users are turned off to Linux primarily because there's people

31:54.840 --> 31:57.960
like us that say well listen I can do everything from the command line and

31:57.960 --> 32:00.920
that works really really well and it's really really efficient I mean you just

32:00.920 --> 32:04.680
talked a couple episodes ago about how efficient crazy efficient it is to be

32:04.680 --> 32:07.960
able to do things from the command line but that scares new users off and so if

32:07.960 --> 32:13.080
we want to reach past 10% of the market share we have to create a welcoming

32:13.080 --> 32:16.440
desktop I think that's the other side of the argument right I agree yeah and that

32:16.440 --> 32:20.560
then and that what that what that means is it doesn't minimize the open seusses

32:20.560 --> 32:24.160
and the Ubuntu's and and the fedoras and the manjias and all of these things

32:24.160 --> 32:27.680
because they obviously have a role to play in this but what I think it does

32:27.680 --> 32:34.000
mean is there I think there has been this group of Linux users who kind of

32:34.000 --> 32:37.940
have just been overlooked because we're so busy thinking we know what's

32:37.940 --> 32:41.120
best for everybody and thinking how we're gonna get more users we're so

32:41.120 --> 32:44.240
we're so worried about getting more people using Linux that we kind of just

32:44.240 --> 32:48.520
forget about this group who I think is is trying to show their voice in these

32:48.520 --> 32:53.120
results and I but I at the same time doesn't mean you cater exclusively to

32:53.120 --> 32:56.160
them I think that would go I think I think that would that would that would

32:56.160 --> 33:00.280
stagnate the adoption of Linux absolutely I agree with you Noah all

33:00.280 --> 33:03.520
right Riley you had a you had a point for unity I wanted to get to that

33:03.520 --> 33:08.240
actually said unity is actually almost underrated because like the only thing

33:08.240 --> 33:12.840
people ever use unity on is Ubuntu and people just don't like Ubuntu for

33:12.840 --> 33:16.360
whatever our reason but if you actually tried it on Arch it's actually pretty

33:16.360 --> 33:21.040
awesome I've been using it for like two weeks now I can't believe how stable it

33:21.040 --> 33:24.700
is are you using the mooo OS or did you just load it on no I just did it I did

33:24.700 --> 33:32.080
the repo method is it the 1404 yeah it's the same version in 1404 it's got

33:32.080 --> 33:37.160
like all the new global menu stuff all that I like that idea we should do a

33:37.160 --> 33:42.720
poll and find out what desktops the chat room and the and the unplugged users use

33:42.720 --> 33:48.120
now there is a caveat with that though cuz Eric installed it he said this week

33:48.120 --> 33:53.280
and his GTK stuff got messed up on the other desktops so if you're you need if

33:53.280 --> 33:56.600
you're gonna use unity just to use unity don't try to use other stuff with it

33:56.600 --> 34:01.080
yeah correct yeah correct yeah it kind of borked my machine and I didn't back

34:01.080 --> 34:06.240
it up before so or that partition anyway so I ended up having to just nuke and

34:06.240 --> 34:11.280
pave my arch install that kind of applies to Ubuntu as well if you use

34:11.280 --> 34:16.520
unity you just use unity yeah that's true you know when I loaded LXQT on my

34:16.520 --> 34:22.480
Ubuntu 1404 install I was a little bummed because the menus were so jammed

34:22.480 --> 34:27.480
full of just all kinds of junk that unity kind of does a good job of not

34:27.480 --> 34:30.840
putting in your face but when you go to something as a more traditional menu

34:30.840 --> 34:36.440
structure oh it was it was like I was feeling the presence of unity and all of

34:36.440 --> 34:40.080
the system setting all of that stuff but you know that's what you get when you

34:40.080 --> 34:44.200
install something over a desktop so that's any no thing you know I should

34:44.200 --> 34:49.000
stop into a spot but it would you mind going to straw poll dot me and making a

34:49.000 --> 34:52.880
poll of like just say what's your desktop environment and just put like you

34:52.880 --> 34:55.880
know some of your some of the top ones in there and give me a link I'll in fact

34:55.880 --> 34:58.960
I'll jump down to restricted casting so you guys can come up with the list while

34:58.960 --> 35:04.400
I tell you guys about digital ocean another sponsor of Linux unplugged and

35:04.400 --> 35:08.080
another company that I am very very happy to be a customer of what is

35:08.080 --> 35:12.240
digital ocean well digital ocean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to

35:12.240 --> 35:15.800
offering the most intuitive an easy way to spin up a cloud server folks in our

audience have been able to get up and running about 42 seconds but just you

35:19.160 --> 35:22.840
know to hedge their bets digital ocean is gonna say yeah we bet about 55

35:22.840 --> 35:27.080
seconds or so you can get a cloud server that you have root access to spun up and

35:27.080 --> 35:33.280
pricing plants are only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD

35:33.280 --> 35:39.560
which I really love the asset that SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer yes a

35:39.560 --> 35:45.360
terabyte so for like you know a lot of you that's right there at $5 you'd be

35:45.360 --> 35:49.560
surprised at how much machine you can get plus digital ocean pairs up with the

35:49.560 --> 35:53.720
tier 1 bandwidth providers and the best data center locations all over the world

35:53.720 --> 35:57.200
in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam and they're always growing

35:57.200 --> 36:01.600
they're always adding in fact to that end they're also hiring so you might

36:01.600 --> 36:05.080
want to go digital ocean calm and click that we're hiring button and see if

well actually it's not so brand new anymore it's getting towards the end of

36:10.800 --> 36:14.840
May well let's let's rock May for Linux unplugged use our promo code unplugged

36:14.840 --> 36:19.240
May and you'll get a $10 credit that $10 credit will let you try out that $5 rig

36:19.240 --> 36:24.840
for two months for absolutely free digital ocean calm unplugged May is that

36:24.840 --> 36:31.000
promo code once you get logged in go check out that dashboard go look at that

36:31.000 --> 36:35.040
dashboard and tell me that is not the coolest thing ever they have managed to

36:35.040 --> 36:39.960
wrap around an entire KVM management system that allows you to deploy virtual

36:39.960 --> 36:44.320
images around the world the different data centers take snapshots and backups

36:44.320 --> 36:50.720
manage the DNS and HTML 5 web console one-click application installs all

36:50.720 --> 36:55.000
riding on top of Linux and KVM through seriously one of the best and most

36:55.000 --> 36:59.620
intuitive but yet powerful interfaces I have ever seen it is worth getting a

36:59.620 --> 37:03.720
digital ocean account just to see a little bit of masterpiece right there

37:03.720 --> 37:09.160
digital ocean calm and use the promo code unplugged May and a huge huge huge

37:09.160 --> 37:14.320
thank you at a digital ocean oh and also I was gonna mention go look at their

37:14.320 --> 37:17.740
pricing plans they have hourly pricing I don't mention that enough and so if you

37:17.740 --> 37:20.440
guys just need to do a little bit of testing you can go get a digital ocean

37:20.440 --> 37:25.280
account use our promo code unplugged May and try the hourly pricing you will

37:25.280 --> 37:28.680
probably be able to run that machine for quite a while with that $10 credit

37:28.680 --> 37:31.960
that is a great way if you just want to run it for a couple of hours I've got

37:31.960 --> 37:34.840
emails from folks that do build projects up there they do some quick

37:34.840 --> 37:38.840
syncing and they shut it down try it out try out their hourly pricing you might

37:38.840 --> 37:42.560
find that works really well for you and also if you get stuck when you're trying

37:42.560 --> 37:45.980
to deploy something go look at their community section they've got some

37:45.980 --> 37:49.960
really good tutorials that people have written up like here's an example how to

37:49.960 --> 37:53.920
use bit torrent sync to synchronize directories and Ubuntu 1404 one of the

37:53.920 --> 37:58.360
things I noticed in our survey was a lot of folks who are using cloud hosting are

37:58.360 --> 38:01.760
using that now as their own method of backup because it's just a really good

38:01.760 --> 38:05.720
way for you to be able to control your data and backup and there's all kinds of

38:05.720 --> 38:07.720
things that are in here it's not just bit torrent sync of course there's all

38:07.720 --> 38:10.320
kinds of server-side applications you might need a little help they've got

38:10.320 --> 38:13.160
tons and tons of pages and their current and up-to-date because they've got a

38:13.160 --> 38:16.480
really passionate community digital ocean comm and use the promo code

38:16.480 --> 38:20.160
unplugged me to get that $10 credit and a big thank you to digital ocean for

38:20.160 --> 38:26.120
sponsoring Linux unplugged loves it so I'll jump back in here how we how we

38:26.120 --> 38:32.720
doing are we working on the pole okay yeah so once you submit it it'll it'll

38:32.720 --> 38:36.120
make a little link that you can copy at the top you just you can drop off the

38:36.120 --> 38:40.280
results a little slash R and then try toss out the chairman we'll have the

38:40.280 --> 38:45.120
chatroom vote and get an idea of what their poll is I'll vote to and we'll put

38:45.120 --> 38:48.440
that out there but I might have too many options it's not good letting me oh

38:48.440 --> 38:52.760
really you guys put that what are the desktops you put in there what are they

38:52.760 --> 39:01.440
oh gosh we put in no Michelle Kate unity Katie e X of CE LX DE LX QT mate i3

39:01.440 --> 39:07.320
awesome ex-nomad Pantheon cinnamon flux box open box TWM window manager e17

39:07.320 --> 39:12.600
that's probably the problem that's just the shell there's a few you can easily

39:12.600 --> 39:17.720
take out like JWM you can take that out yeah this is what happens when a

39:17.720 --> 39:20.760
committee comes up with some of it if also some of them you maybe just

39:20.760 --> 39:24.480
combine a bunch of the very very simple yeah let's do that yeah that's a great

39:24.480 --> 39:35.560
idea XFCE and LXD yes we should just say tiling or something all right UT is not

39:35.560 --> 39:38.720
it's not even final yet let's give you to be in there dear Devlin has something

39:38.720 --> 39:42.120
he wants to add to the to the discussion let's him go ahead even though I

39:42.120 --> 39:47.280
personally use a tree most of the time and I use gnome tree when I go out in

39:47.280 --> 39:53.240
public and if I'm going to a place full of noobs I go with something more that

39:53.240 --> 39:58.000
will be more user-friendly to them even though my personal preference is I tree

39:58.000 --> 40:04.680
in that scenario I think it matches well and I think a lot of us kind of do that

40:04.680 --> 40:11.160
we've seen that at least in the in the Linux best stuff like that people go and

40:11.160 --> 40:17.320
use their technical stuff but when they go into to meet new users it's just that

40:17.320 --> 40:27.200
becomes so simpler to to show something up yeah all right so I wanted to open up

40:27.200 --> 40:32.200
a topic to the to the room here so now everyone is free to move about the

40:32.200 --> 40:37.600
cabin one thing I thought it'd be kind of fun because we are obviously a bunch

40:37.600 --> 40:41.000
of Linux enthusiasts slash advocates we're always talking about why people

40:41.000 --> 40:45.240
switch to Linux I also think it's good though to be real about it so that way

40:45.240 --> 40:50.400
because here's the here's the here's the truth you guys here's there's a lot of

40:50.400 --> 40:54.920
people listen to this show that have a dirty secret they don't use Linux they

40:54.920 --> 40:59.040
run Windows or Mac or whatever it is but they listen they listen to kind of keep

40:59.040 --> 41:01.960
their beak wet they listen to kind of keep their ear to the ground so they

41:01.960 --> 41:05.880
know what's going on because they're considering it and so for these folks I

41:05.880 --> 41:09.240
like to give them the real story and you know I've been thinking about this a lot

41:09.240 --> 41:15.240
because in how to Linux chase is going to be making the switch and you know I

41:15.240 --> 41:17.740
don't want to blow smoke up his butt I want to be honest like when something

41:17.740 --> 41:20.600
sucks it sucks and I wanted to be able to say yeah man that doesn't work so well

41:20.600 --> 41:24.240
but don't worry you can do X or yeah we're still working on that that kind of

41:24.240 --> 41:28.760
stuff so bit puffing the chatroom just came out of the closet he's on a Mac

41:28.760 --> 41:35.560
right now but I thought let's talk about some some Linux switching stories or

41:35.560 --> 41:39.480
when we convince somebody to switch to Linux and it backfired real bad because

41:39.480 --> 41:42.520
maybe we can learn as a group I'll start and then I wanted to toss over to Noah

41:42.520 --> 41:45.400
because I know he's done some client deployment so he probably has the story

41:45.400 --> 41:49.640
but I'll start with mine my like one of my biggest Linux shames like my big

41:49.640 --> 41:55.040
Linux failure was when I got my wife who was my girlfriend at the time I believe

41:55.040 --> 42:01.480
switched over to Linux and it was KDE this is a long time ago and I switched

42:01.480 --> 42:05.120
her photo manager over from whatever she was using at the time on the Mac it

42:05.120 --> 42:09.200
might have been I photo though I feel like this was pre I photo it was

42:09.200 --> 42:12.880
different enough that when she was organizing her photos she was

42:12.880 --> 42:15.960
permanently moving and deleting them and didn't know that because that's not how

42:15.960 --> 42:20.080
it worked in her own program and she I end up losing a whole bunch of her her

42:20.080 --> 42:24.680
photos and that was like you know at that point we were done you know

42:24.680 --> 42:28.120
experiment was over going back to another opera I can't remember was

42:28.120 --> 42:32.960
Windows or what it was and it was no that the switch to Linux experiment was

42:32.960 --> 42:37.640
done no no we're married now so I managed to save the relationship but I

42:37.640 --> 42:41.200
don't know if I had pushed that Linux thing who knows so that's that's my

42:41.200 --> 42:44.480
failure you know I should have I should have probably thought ahead and thought

42:44.480 --> 42:47.680
yeah this photo programs gonna work different for her but Noah have you been

42:47.680 --> 42:52.200
out there have you been to have you convinced a client or a user or a friend

42:52.200 --> 42:55.840
or family member to switch to Linux only to have it blow up in their face or your

42:55.840 --> 43:00.240
face as the case might be yeah many it has it has blown up I want to give a

43:00.240 --> 43:05.720
disclaimer it has gone the other way many many many more times nine out of ten

43:05.720 --> 43:11.080
times right when I install Linux for a client they are much happier and I lose

43:11.080 --> 43:14.840
money right that's that's 90% of the way they're not they're not taking they're

43:14.840 --> 43:18.400
not calling you up for support anymore so you lose money right yes right but

43:18.400 --> 43:22.960
there have been a couple of times one one that I'll tell you one that's that's

43:22.960 --> 43:28.120
comical and then then a true example of where Linux just failed the we instead

43:28.120 --> 43:32.360
we had a hotel it was complete web-based system that they used to check people in

43:32.360 --> 43:35.400
and out and so we walked in this I said well what's the problem well the

43:35.400 --> 43:39.160
computer is really slow and it takes a long time to boot nothing really works

43:39.160 --> 43:45.400
right and I I mentioned this when when we were all meeting at Linux fest but I

43:45.400 --> 43:49.520
have a dirty a dirty little secret when I anytime I try somebody out on Linux

43:49.520 --> 43:55.520
for the first time what I will do is I will use a Samsung 840 SSD because when

43:55.520 --> 43:59.280
I put that drive into the computer all of a sudden not only don't they have the

43:59.280 --> 44:03.160
junk that comes with Windows but that SSD just super fast yeah right and base

44:03.160 --> 44:07.960
next to an actual spinning hard drive it just seems that much faster right so I

44:07.960 --> 44:11.120
put the drive in there and oh my gosh the computer so fast everything works

44:11.120 --> 44:15.420
we're so happy great when I leave the next day I get a call the computer

44:15.420 --> 44:18.440
doesn't work what do you mean it doesn't work so I go back over and I look and she

44:18.440 --> 44:23.320
goes well I don't like see this the icon has changed it's no longer the little

44:23.320 --> 44:26.480
blue e how do we get the blue e on there and I said well it'll do the same thing

44:26.480 --> 44:29.800
just click on this well we don't know which one to click on and all of our

44:29.800 --> 44:32.360
staff doesn't know which one to click on and when you open it everything works

44:32.360 --> 44:35.200
fine but if anyone closes it then we don't know how to get back there so I

44:35.200 --> 44:39.000
actually ended up downloading the icon file and changing it and renaming it

44:39.000 --> 44:42.400
Internet Explorer and theming it to look like Windows Internet Explorer just to

44:42.400 --> 44:47.120
keep them happy oh man now that I don't think that really exemplifies Linux

44:47.120 --> 44:50.920
failing where Linux actually truly and totally failed me was I had a friend and

44:50.920 --> 44:53.960
she called me she said you know what do you recommend I'm my computer's kind of

44:53.960 --> 44:57.080
reaching the end of its life and I said what do you do with it well I get online

44:57.080 --> 45:01.640
and I edit documents and I do this and I do that okay so walked her through

45:01.640 --> 45:08.160
installing Linux all of her music would not pull over because she had purchased

45:08.160 --> 45:13.000
it in whatever Windows uses I don't even know but plays for sure purchase well I

45:13.000 --> 45:19.040
sure she had a zoom okay so whatever plays yeah okay so whatever it is it

45:19.040 --> 45:22.680
doesn't pull into Linux and it was it was a it was it was one of those things

45:22.680 --> 45:25.960
where she'd asked me before can I move my music collection over well of course

45:25.960 --> 45:29.320
you can move music Linux plays music yeah no problem right right no that

45:29.320 --> 45:32.480
didn't work yeah and then she goes well I can play can I play Netflix well we

45:32.480 --> 45:36.120
installed the Netflix desktop but if you don't have a really powerful machine

45:36.120 --> 45:40.160
that running all of that the layers that it needs to run that didn't work yeah

45:40.160 --> 45:44.600
yeah and essentially what it all boiled down to was she could edit her word

45:44.600 --> 45:48.800
documents and she could check her email and that was it and we ended up going

45:48.800 --> 45:54.200
back to Windows oh yeah I mean that you know like that the WMA they were

45:54.200 --> 45:59.880
probably even WMA files they were yeah I mean I think yeah so that's you know

45:59.880 --> 46:04.160
that's a that's a hard thing because that's Angela my wife's mom kind of the

46:04.160 --> 46:07.640
same situation right they use a computer they're on a satellite connection so

46:07.640 --> 46:12.880
they're basically just downloading a few things printing off photos and you know

46:12.880 --> 46:18.160
updating Facebook but they have bought I mean I don't want to speak for them but

46:18.160 --> 46:22.480
it's potentially thousands of dollars worth of DRM copyrighted protected music

46:22.480 --> 46:26.800
and it's just one of those things where I don't have the time to unencumber all

46:26.800 --> 46:31.600
of that music for them so they are on like some ancient you might even be

46:31.600 --> 46:36.920
Vista install like what are you gonna do right all right mumble anybody else in

46:36.920 --> 46:40.360
the mumble room want to share like a Linux deployment blew up I mean again

46:40.360 --> 46:44.240
like Noah said of course it generally goes good I don't have like a huge

46:44.240 --> 46:47.800
detailed one but essentially I gave someone Linux because they were tired of

46:47.800 --> 46:53.440
windows and then they I had to go away for like a couple weeks or so and while

46:53.440 --> 47:01.080
at the time I got back they had given up and bought a Mac that was a quick nut

47:01.080 --> 47:03.920
punch like I was like I thought you're gonna keep going then boom you strike

47:03.920 --> 47:10.560
with that I was going over to a friend of a friend's house it was late at night

47:10.560 --> 47:16.360
we weren't gonna be there for long and I see that he's running Ubuntu on his TV

47:16.360 --> 47:21.400
like right in front of his bed I'm like oh cool Linux Linux Linux and then he

47:21.400 --> 47:24.640
couldn't get the resolution correct and I'm like well hmm maybe you should just

47:24.640 --> 47:30.640
try updating so we do a little pseudo app get update pseudo upgrade and it

47:30.640 --> 47:40.840
doesn't boot and I have to leave pretty soon and he never talks to me again all

47:40.840 --> 47:51.400
right if my microphone works yeah yes yeah we so does it go ahead check yeah

47:51.400 --> 47:56.640
okay actually I have three stories why can I can wrap it up in one because it's

47:56.640 --> 48:01.520
always the same story for all three okay what is it in the last month I just

48:01.520 --> 48:05.200
can't explain how it happened but I guess it's mixture between the XP ending

48:05.200 --> 48:12.400
and the always malware stuff that happens on Windows systems anyway three

48:12.400 --> 48:17.960
guys came to me and asked specifically to install them Linux on their

48:17.960 --> 48:25.360
computers and I must say they are happy with it oh good just happy well that's

48:25.360 --> 48:34.200
good that's great yeah I had my dad on it for years and years and then he ended

48:34.200 --> 48:38.520
up wanting a new computer and the shiny Mac got him and we had a couple we had a

48:38.520 --> 48:41.520
little we had a little bit of a mini disaster that kind of pushed him over

48:41.520 --> 48:45.960
and yeah but my worst story is the photo one all right we've had we've had some

48:45.960 --> 48:49.440
back and forth but we do now have the official oh yeah what we have one more

48:49.440 --> 48:52.240
story before I get to know I just wanted to point out that my story was like a

48:52.240 --> 48:57.280
dropping a bomb with a Mac thing but this is also in like 2005 2006 so it was

48:57.280 --> 49:01.760
it was kind of a mess back then anyway yeah mine mine was mine was way mine

49:01.760 --> 49:04.640
like was before iTunes was a thing I think it before I photo was a thing

49:04.640 --> 49:07.840
that's how long ago mine was but and so like now I would ever use dark table or

49:07.840 --> 49:13.280
something like that yeah really short positive one sure yeah yeah go ahead

49:13.280 --> 49:20.080
turns out my 80 year old staff that actually put Suza on his box on his own

49:20.080 --> 49:27.080
and it works he's happy with it you know and you guys has and I didn't help him

49:27.080 --> 49:33.160
that no bearing on the fact that I'm a Linux user now but my my grandpa on my

49:33.160 --> 49:39.560
dad's side of the family he's he's in his 80s and he's got he's his favorite

49:39.560 --> 49:44.280
distro is puppy Linux that's his he's loved puppy Linux for years and he

49:44.280 --> 49:47.120
thinks this is the best perfect distro for him and he likes putting on low end

49:47.120 --> 49:51.800
hardware but he's also a big Fedora user and he tries out every Ubuntu

49:51.800 --> 49:55.200
release but he always ends up going back to Fedora which I think is hilarious

49:55.200 --> 49:59.960
because yeah he's also in his 80s and it's awesome yeah it's just something

49:59.960 --> 50:04.480
he's always enjoyed tinkering with and I didn't even know until after I started

50:04.480 --> 50:09.080
the Linux action show like a couple of years into it it came up like my dad

50:09.080 --> 50:11.880
mentioned to him that I was doing a Linux show and it's like oh you like

50:11.880 --> 50:17.320
Linux like are you serious like my mind was blown it my mind was it was like I

50:17.320 --> 50:20.960
entered another reality all right so yeah that's more or less what happened

50:20.960 --> 50:26.120
to me as well that's amazing here is the we've had a few iterations of but here's

50:26.120 --> 50:28.960
our latest poll which desktop environment do you use I'm gonna vote

50:28.960 --> 50:32.040
we'll also have this in the show notes we want the download audience to vote

50:32.040 --> 50:35.120
too I'm just curious what you guys use so I'm gonna vote for Gnome Shell for

50:35.120 --> 50:39.240
both of us okay Matt okay sounds good that sounds like me all right so I'm

50:39.240 --> 50:43.640
voting and I guess I already voted on that maybe I already voted voted all

50:43.640 --> 50:46.720
right and the results are hold on survey says I think we put straw poll under

50:46.720 --> 50:53.260
some load here right now Gnome Shell has a healthy 27% lead followed by KDE with

50:53.260 --> 51:01.600
a 22% lead cinnamon coming in at 11% unity 9% XFCE 9% mate 7% and then it

51:01.600 --> 51:04.840
kind of trails off from there this is almost mirroring exactly what we saw in

51:04.840 --> 51:08.360
our Linux that's wild and you know I've kind of lost my love for cinnamon I mean

51:08.360 --> 51:12.240
it's it was fun for a while I just you know it's kind of like watching the same

51:12.240 --> 51:15.880
TV show over and over after a while you can't get bored with it well yeah but

51:15.880 --> 51:19.560
the extensions of cinnamon are not as good as gnomes but they are pretty good

51:19.560 --> 51:23.000
yeah they are pretty good it got my interest at the end of the day for me in

51:23.000 --> 51:26.480
cinnamon and I I think it's great in like for a lot of folks who want a

51:26.480 --> 51:31.500
classical UI but brought a little more into you know the year 2014 man to

51:31.500 --> 51:35.280
cinnamon nail that and it doesn't really well for me the problem is is I think

51:35.280 --> 51:38.760
what you're kind of getting at Matt is I'm just kind of done with that it's the

51:38.760 --> 51:43.080
same thing that eventually kind of wears on me about mate or Mate you know I've

51:43.080 --> 51:48.560
I've played that I grok that UI but I recognize that the paradigm that was

51:48.560 --> 51:53.680
set up way back in the 80s you know is due for some refreshing and I think

51:53.680 --> 51:57.720
that's why I like gnome 3 and and honestly if I spend enough time

51:57.720 --> 52:01.840
configuring my KDE desktop what I like about KDE 2 is I can make it feel like a

52:01.840 --> 52:07.440
more modern operating system it's true I mean now on some boxes I still do use

52:07.440 --> 52:11.720
XFC simply because I'm not in front of them every day I just need I need quick

52:11.720 --> 52:14.720
access to something I've used in a launcher anyways I don't care why run

52:14.720 --> 52:18.880
the resources at that point but for a daily use situation yeah I do prefer

52:18.880 --> 52:26.160
norm go ahead Riley for people who don't want like all the unnecessary stuff that

52:26.160 --> 52:30.320
Katie yes like it still has all your extensions it still has like your

52:30.320 --> 52:43.680
desktop but effects and all that stuff so yeah pretty much 30 ways to get to

52:43.680 --> 52:50.880
the control panel I mean you know that's kind of I would disagree with that but

52:50.880 --> 52:56.280
that's I think cinnamon is also a good source for people who want to a full

52:56.280 --> 53:00.440
fledged DE but can't you know put they can't devote a lot of resources to it

53:00.440 --> 53:06.440
because I've there's been benchmarks that show that XFC Inc and cinnamon are

53:06.440 --> 53:10.440
very close to about the same resource usage and that's actually kind of

53:10.440 --> 53:14.480
amazing when you can say and you think about it came from gnome how does how

53:14.480 --> 53:19.160
does cinnamon work when you don't have compositing does it still work okay you

53:19.160 --> 53:23.280
know it's it doesn't work very well it's very it's very slow it needs a graphics

53:23.280 --> 53:26.080
card it doesn't really matter what kind of graphics card so that would be an

53:26.080 --> 53:29.760
area though where XFCE kind of has yeah that leg up and still you're still in a

53:29.760 --> 53:34.120
GTK environment and I think an area where LXQT is gonna be a strong

53:34.120 --> 53:39.680
competitor for XFC I wanted to go back to something that Crossroads was gonna

53:39.680 --> 53:46.720
mention go ahead Crossroads okay so the thing about thing about cinnamon is that

53:46.720 --> 53:52.040
at least when I but I always thought when I was on unity I saw cinnamon I

53:52.040 --> 53:55.080
thought it was great I thought it was wonderful I really wanted to try it out

53:55.080 --> 53:59.440
I never really got around to it ended up using KDE and used a few things and then

53:59.440 --> 54:07.520
I finally installed the mangero version of with cinnamon and I you know I thought

54:07.520 --> 54:10.160
I was gonna love it I thought it was gonna be great and I used it it was fine

54:10.160 --> 54:18.360
and then I got bored really quickly and I just it never turned me on I think

54:18.360 --> 54:21.840
sometimes too because the options are there to tweak with them you fiddle with

54:21.840 --> 54:25.400
them and then you get bored with fiddling with those options and kind of

54:25.400 --> 54:28.880
sounds so weird it almost sounds like what's it called when like you get

54:28.880 --> 54:34.200
kidnapped and then you relate to your kidnappers Stockholm Stockholm Stockholm

54:34.200 --> 54:36.920
I wonder if gnome gives me Stockholm syndrome a little bit because I'm like

54:36.920 --> 54:39.640
because it doesn't have all these things for me to tweak although they are

54:39.640 --> 54:43.520
tweakable actually like a lot of stuff is surprisingly tweakable but because

54:43.520 --> 54:46.800
like it's not just a right-click it's not right there I generally just leave

54:46.800 --> 54:52.040
it alone like one I essentially I install gnome I spend about 20 minutes getting

54:52.040 --> 54:55.840
like my theme and my icons and and fiddling with different things that may

54:55.840 --> 54:58.880
you know every time I try something new settling on something and then I

54:58.880 --> 55:04.400
generally don't ever change it again unless a new icon back comes out that I

55:04.400 --> 55:08.880
want to check like right so but on KDE it is a daily occurrence that I'm

55:08.880 --> 55:12.640
changing something because it's there and it's it's just right there too it's

55:12.640 --> 55:17.800
right-click boom there it is so it's a long and short if you have any type of

55:17.800 --> 55:22.400
obsessive types I guess that's probably not because I'm that way too um you know

55:22.400 --> 55:24.720
I speak from experience that might not be the best desktop choice for folks

55:24.720 --> 55:28.360
like us I don't know now lion head you just don't get it I understand what's

55:28.360 --> 55:36.360
your point well I just feel confused when I'm using it so I just feel that

55:36.360 --> 55:43.400
no X yeah so I just feel that XFCE is more streamlined at least for my kind of

55:43.400 --> 55:48.880
workflow yeah it just works better on the laptop or on the same time you can

55:48.880 --> 55:53.600
stream it streamline it whatever way you want to yeah all right well before we

55:53.600 --> 55:57.960
wrap up I'll go ahead finish up finishing thought I was just gonna say I

55:57.960 --> 56:01.840
think the the problem with gnome is that people aren't you aren't used to the

56:01.840 --> 56:05.040
paradigm so they expect something else yeah when if they give it enough time

56:05.040 --> 56:09.640
then gnome could actually be it can change your your your preference of the

56:09.640 --> 56:13.320
paradigm and you'll actually like no more than other ones if you just try it

56:13.320 --> 56:20.400
yep very good guys well so if you wanted to check out this the home server survey

56:20.400 --> 56:23.600
I would especially if you're gonna build a home server soon or you're thinking

56:23.600 --> 56:27.040
about or you want to figure out how you want to improve yours go look at those

56:27.040 --> 56:31.280
results there's some great content that you guys supply gals guys and gals I say

56:31.280 --> 56:36.000
guys universally it's a unisex term for me just disclaimer on that and then also

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
we'd love to hear your feedback I I decided this week we would do the survey

56:40.000 --> 56:44.320
for the feedback we generally read a few emails on the Linux unplugged show for

56:44.320 --> 56:48.760
this week I actually ended up replying directly a lot to the emails and didn't

56:48.760 --> 56:51.800
really feel like anyone particularly grabbed me that I want to pull into the

56:51.800 --> 56:56.280
show but we do love featuring your emails so go over to Jupiter broadcasting

56:56.280 --> 56:59.480
comm click that contact link choose Linux unplug from the drop-down and

56:59.480 --> 57:05.120
maybe you can kick off our next discussion I love having a topic on the

57:05.120 --> 57:08.240
show that sort of inspired by an email that comes it maybe not be the main

57:08.240 --> 57:11.400
topic but something we can chew on is always appreciated so anything in the

57:11.400 --> 57:14.480
Linux space that you would love to hear a good discussion on please send it and

57:14.480 --> 57:18.680
ask your question don't make it too long so that way we can fit it on air and you

57:18.680 --> 57:21.560
never know maybe you will help set the course for the next Linux unplugged show

57:21.560 --> 57:25.040
and last but not least we do have this open mumble room from these fine

57:25.040 --> 57:28.280
gentlemen that you've been hearing from and we don't have any ladies that are

57:28.280 --> 57:31.000
joining us in the virtual mumble room so ladies out there if you'd like to

57:31.000 --> 57:34.400
represent the female Linux perspective we'd love to have you just go over to

57:34.400 --> 57:40.000
JB live TV we do Linux unplugged live at 2 p.m. Pacific on Tuesday just go to

57:40.000 --> 57:43.320
Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar to get that in your time zone and when

57:43.320 --> 57:46.320
you go to the live page we have an embedded chat room and you can join that

57:46.320 --> 57:50.520
embedded chat room and hit bang mumble and when you hit bang mumble it tells

57:50.520 --> 57:53.200
you the mumble server address now you might say Chris why don't you just say

57:53.200 --> 57:56.640
it right now well first of all dear listener perhaps it's gonna change at

57:56.640 --> 58:00.520
some point and I just want you to stay dynamic or maybe maybe it's a members

58:00.520 --> 58:03.600
only jacket and the only way you can find out is you come to our chat room
