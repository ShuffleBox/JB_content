1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The internet should be simple and safe.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We strongly believe that having nothing to hide shouldn't mean having to show it all.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is Silent Keys.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A beautiful and secure keyboard that defends your privacy.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Open source and plug and play, Silent Keys protects you from viruses, ransomware, mass surveillance and identity theft.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Stop governments, employers, search engines and credit agencies from seeing what you do online.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Browse without fear and protect who you are, what you do and what you like.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Block annoying tracking ads and encrypt all your traffic so you can surf the web privately.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Every year, millions of people experience banking fraud and lose their savings.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Be safe from keyloggers when accessing online banking, Bitcoin and social media.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Stream your favorite TV shows from all over the world with no restrictions.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Because a simple keylogger can record all your keystrokes and defeat the best security,

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
we created a tamper-proof keyboard, an aluminum shell that can't be opened without breaking.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's really easy to use. Plug it in, press a button and boot.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Silent Keys includes Satya, a modern and secure desktop.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The best way to protect an operating system against viruses is to make it read-only and have it load from scratch at every use.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This makes it immune to insecure systems and leaves no trace.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Just like a CD-ROM.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Silent Keys features a secure update switch with free and unlimited updates.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
To protect your privacy and prevent data leaks, Silent Keys automatically encrypts your web connection using Tor or VPN.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Anonymous browsing on Silent Keys safely counters fake Wi-Fi, ISP snooping, mass surveillance and hackers.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All ads are blocked too.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Secure messaging and end-to-end encryption for your email comes out of the box.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That is the slowest email encryption I've ever seen.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay, if this is legit, if they can make this something that's really simple for the average person, it's not so bad.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But look at this, Wes, 616 backers. They were only going for $55,000, they've raised $105,000.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So they're scratching some itch, but it's essentially a read-only live GNOME desktop with a decent GNOME theme.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't look bad.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You know what, Wes?

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why is it a keyboard as well?

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, because then it's the tamper-proof device where it freaks out when it gets broken.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You know what, guys? This is what it tells us.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It doesn't matter about the technical whiz-bang because, you know, they mean this is or it is what it is.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It may or may not be hacker-proof, right?

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Right.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What it does tell you is that we are in the wrong business.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 150 for June 21st, 2016.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is awash in distribution releases.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
My name is Chris.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
My name is Wes.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How about it, Wes?

42
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Like today, this week at least, it giveth.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We have some great releases to talk about today that are super fresh.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We've got a Mycroft update that I'm really excited to talk about for multiple reasons.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We'll tell you guys all about that.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Some cool hardware coming for Ubuntu Phone.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
A free great game for Linux this week.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
DockerCon's going on right now, and I've snussed out – snussed out?

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's sussed and sniffed.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I snussed out some of the best stuff.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And then coming up last but not least, we're going to look at Maroo?

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Maroo OS.

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The desktop on your Android phone.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yeah, it's – they claim they've got Convergence, and they've based it on Debian, and it's here today.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And I – it uses like Wayland or some shenanigans.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Like there's some crazy far out future technology in that thing.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't know, Wes.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You have to dig into that.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wes has got a load on his phone.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He'll give us his take, how it runs on his Nexus 5.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And towards the end, Flatpaks, they're officially here.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah, you know, universal software installation.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's another universal answer.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Another standard Flatpak.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now we've got Snaps, Flatpaks, App Images.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They're all competing to essentially do the same thing.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But we've already talked about that aspect of it.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But since we started that conversation, people have gone to war.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It is a fast-moving story.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Holy.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I mean, I don't want to drop an S-bomb at the top of the show.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sure we were all like kind of bitter about Linux packaging or something.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't know.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I mean, it has gone to full-fledged war over this.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And boy, my – somehow because I talked on two shows, I have wandered in the middle of this.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And I am just getting slammed on all sides.

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And we're going to just talk a little bit about it today in the show.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And we'll see.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Depending on how far this beer gets me, I may get a little ranty, but I doubt it.

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Because we just got one great beer here from Fremont Brewing just a bit down the road.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Just a piece from where you probably work.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I mean, not too far.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
All things considered, coming right out of a local Seattle brewery.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Because beer matters, it says.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is the Summer Ale, their American Pale Ale.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This looks like a nice treat, Wes.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And I've got to say, too, it's got a good color to it.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Do I have the camera on?

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You guys probably can't make it out.

91
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah, it's a little dark.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But it has a really good color to it.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oh, I didn't open mine.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Jeez.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Come on, Chris.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's see.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's document the hazard and mess right now.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There we go.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So we will be –

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We've come prepared.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We've been enjoying that during the show today.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So we've got a lot to get into.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's bring in our virtual lug.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumba Room.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Hey, yo.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Good to see you.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hello.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Wow.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I really caught – look at that.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I caught them off guard.

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Did you see that?

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes, you did.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
All right.

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So guys, I already asked you on the pre-show.

116
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So I already know the answer.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We haven't really got a chance to kick the tires yet.

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm going to hold my powder drive for the segment.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But Fedora 24 is officially out today.

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And there are some really nice things in this one.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Mainly, the one that I'm really looking forward to is in GNOME 3.20 is in this.

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Also, talked about it just a bit briefly there,

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Flatpak support is also included in this version of Fedora.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So they have sort of an official, unofficial upgrade guide,

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm going to call it, that we will link in the show notes.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Interesting.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah, where you can do an update.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And I have a – just put it actually recently back into production a bit.

129
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll tell you about that later in the show.

130
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The Fedora Cloud installation that I have running a couple of different containers

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and whatnots that I'm going to do an upgrade from 23 to 24 as part of my –

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll be curious to see what you think about that.

133
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yeah, I'll give you my thoughts.

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Part of my review in Linux Action Show on Sunday, I'll talk about Fedora 24.

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But congrats to Fedora for getting a release out, shipping it with GNOME 3.20 in there.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And I think it's got kernel 4.5 or some shenanigans like that.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And of course, looking pretty solid with the Flatpak support.

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So that's Fedora.

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We don't have a lot to say about it because we have so much to cover.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why don't we jump into a little Mycroft news because Ryan is joining us today.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Wonderful.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Welcome back to Unplugged, Mr. Ryan.

143
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hey, it's good to be back.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Thank you, sir.

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you very much for being here.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We really do appreciate it.

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So tell me about version.7, responsive listening, third-party skills, a new voice,

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
the big update, and better emotions on the front panel too.

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Like there's a lot to cover here.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
But what the hell is responsive listening?

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Can we start there?

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Responsive listening is a name I came up with because I didn't have a good name for how to describe it.

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But for the longest time, and you'll see this in the blog post that I made,

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
we played around with this idea of passive listening, and it worked all right.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And that was the deal where you can say an entire sentence, put Mycroft's name anywhere,

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and it will trigger and then take action.

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But what we found was that lots of people were already interacting with the device

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
in the way that Google now has trained them, and Siri and the Echo.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And so they were saying, you know, hey, Mycroft, and then saying whatever they were going to say.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How were they supposed to be saying it beforehand?

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, it's not that they couldn't say it that way.

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's that they could insert the name anywhere that they wanted to.

164
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, so the actual Mycroft part of the sentence, the word Mycroft might be four or five words into the sentence,

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and the system would have to be able to wake up and scan back to find what was said before the name, right?

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Correct, and it was pretty cool technology, but people didn't understand the latency that came from that.

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And it was only about a second, but there are now expectations,

168
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
especially because people are comparing us against the Echo.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And so what we've done is we've gone ahead and put responsive listening as the default.

170
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So you say, hey, Mycroft, and then your query, and it comes back pretty much instantaneously.

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And then what we've done is we've gone ahead and begun working on making the existing passive listening,

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
is what we called it, an option that people can just go in and check in the config.

173
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, that's neat.

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Responsive listening, that's a good name.

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And I guess I assumed because of that's how, like you just said,

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
all of the other assistants that are sort of on the market right now operate the other way.

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I just assumed that would be the way Mycroft would operate.

178
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
There's so many little aspects to this.

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And Ryan, it got me thinking about sort of an advantage that Mycroft might have,

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
being open source, where the code can be publicly audited.

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
People have a higher level of trust in it than say maybe the Alexa or the Google stuff,

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
because you don't really fully understand their complete motivation behind the product.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You have a pretty good idea, though.

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And with Mycroft, everything being kind of out in the public,

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
it doesn't quite matter what the motivation is,

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
because you can still see what the end result is literally for yourself.

187
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And so that gives Mycroft the opportunity to maybe be a little creepier than say Google or Amazon can be.

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Like it could eventually give Mycroft room to say,

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
hey, would you optionally like that we listen to everything all the time?

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I mean, there's like a lot of different things that people might be willing to let a fully open source assistant do

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
that they wouldn't want a commercial version to do.

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Am I making sense here?

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, but you're operating under the assumption that the Echo isn't already listening all the time.

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, yeah, that's true.

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But yeah, and what we're hoping is that eventually I think that's the way that a lot of these little smart assistants will be,

196
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
regardless of whether or not they're in a dedicated device in your house or on your phone or wherever.

197
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The question is about trust and about whether or not, because I think eventually,

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and we talked about this at one of our meetings, one of our all hands meetings,

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
somebody brought the fact that eventually they thought that the benefits would outweigh what a lot of people saw as security concerns.

200
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm not saying that that's how we feel.

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:21,000
But, you know, it's the idea that it could listen and be smart enough to actually offer you up suggestions

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
or take notes for you that you might forget to take yourself and things like that.

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Those benefits might eventually outweigh people's privacy concerns.

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But the worry is, you know, what company are you going to want to trust your data with?

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Are you going to want to trust your data with a company?

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Being an open source company, an open source project, we get to be a little more transparent with users

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
and let them know, you know, here's kind of how things are.

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can audit the code and make sure that it's only listening when you want it to

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and not have to do some sort of crazy gymnastics to figure out what exactly is happening with your data

210
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and whether or not you just bugged your house.

211
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yeah, and what exactly is it that they're storing and why are they storing it?

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You know, you make a good point because I think, unfortunately, and I want to make sure that sinks in

213
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
because I always get pushback on this, unfortunately, I think you are right in the sense that

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
the convenience that a lot of these different platforms offer, be it iOS or Android or the entire Google platform,

215
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
it is, for people who just need a little extra help in life, it is actually very tempting.

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And it seems to me that if they're willing to make that concession to use Google, like I have recently

217
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
kind of started going all in with Google because Google Photos is just, they just happen to nail something

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that is exceedingly important to me as a father of three young, adorable children.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Google Photos is one of two offsite backups, plus I have a local storage of all my photos.

220
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And the ability to search that and say, you know, Grandma and Hugs and Dylan and get all that mapped out is super useful.

221
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And then I started using Google Fit because I'm starting to exercise more and getting all of that information,

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
being able to use different devices for different tasks and have all of them report back to Google Fit

223
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
as a central input to get all of this. So now I have like one spot to go to get a lot of different information

224
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
from weight, water, sleep, quality, walks, all of this information is in one dashboard for me now.

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
With charts and all this kind of crap that is very nice to have.

226
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And of course I know, I am fully intellectually aware of what that means they are doing in terms of tracking

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and the information they're building about me. And if I had a better solution for some of this stuff,

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I immediately would probably go somewhere else. So I think even if Mycroft gets to the market in a year or two

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
where they're competitive at some of these levels, be it the artificial assistant where you can prompt it

230
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and ask it questions or whatever it is, I think if people are already like me who are very aware of the problem

231
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and are still willing to make the concession, as soon as something like this comes along,

232
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
it's going to be like, I'll be an early adopter, we've got to go all in on this.

233
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I think it's from people like me to just the average person are going to be really responsive to a product like that.

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's a big one.

235
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I think that what we have to do as a community is consider what we want the future of this stuff to look like.

236
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's so crazy how locked down this specific technology is with these providers that aren't Mycroft.

237
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They're much more locked down than let's say like Android, which is slowly moving that direction.

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But when it comes to these intelligent personal assistants, it's really, really a black box.

239
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What's crazy is they're quickly becoming one of the most intimate things you interact with.

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What I think is that we should have an answer and that's what we're trying to do with Mycroft.

241
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
One thing I wanted to get back to is before we talk about all the crazy stuff going on in this space,

242
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I wanted to talk a little bit more about the release because you talked about a couple of things that were in there.

243
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
One thing I want to know more about is third party skills and things like that too.

244
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Absolutely. That was the end of discussion on that. I was kind of curious to go more back to the 0.7 release.

245
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
For those with developer kits, we got a lot of new face animations.

246
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's a lot more responsive.

247
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We're looking at trying to present data on the face on that little LED array.

248
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Whenever you ask for the weather, it gives a really nice, clean interface for seeing the weather as well as other things like that.

249
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Then third party skills, which you talked about.

250
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is the beginning of something we've been planning for a long time was a way to install third party skills.

251
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Right now, you have to literally drop the skills into a directory for them to be loaded when Mycroft starts.

252
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We're building a skill management system that talks to a repo full of skills people have submitted.

253
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The idea is that you can just add a Roku skill and various other skills.

254
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, man, Ryan. Oh, man.

255
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The thing is, there's already third party skills out there.

256
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
We need to get a list of those so that people can start playing with them now.

257
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's why we kind of accelerated this piece because we keep getting people saying,

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hey, I wrote a skill. Will you accept it in the core?

259
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We have to walk this line of, yeah, that's a really cool skill, but I don't think most people use that.

260
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I know that there are people who will use it.

261
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's see about getting it, making it installable by people.

262
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
For instance, there's this one called diagnostic skill,

263
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
and you can ask it all sorts of questions about your system that Mycroft is running on.

264
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What's the CPU usage? What's the RAM usage? Things like that.

265
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Then we also saw, oh, boy, there's lots of skills.

266
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Mycroft is a little bit more personal now.

267
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You can say, how are you doing? Hello?

268
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Hello, that's so sweet.

269
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm not sure if it's still in there, but for a while, when you asked him how he's doing,

270
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
sometimes he would tell you a little bit about what's going on.

271
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He would say, hey, I'm doing good. I'm busy.

272
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Then he would list off a few processes that were running on the bar.

273
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's awesome.

274
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's really funny.

275
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I secretly use Arch Linux.

276
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah, and we got a new voice, too.

277
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's cool. In fact, we have an example.

278
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Poppy posted this. I think he's pretty excited by this.

279
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
This is the new...

280
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
74, Lawrence, Kansas has few clouds and is currently 76 degrees.

281
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, here, I'll start from the very beginning.

282
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
With a high of 78 and a low of 74, Lawrence, Kansas has few clouds and is currently 76 degrees.

283
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Certainly a little robotic, Ryan, but that's pretty...

284
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's really cool.

285
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah, I mean, it definitely sounds like Poppy.

286
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It sure does.

287
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's amazing.

288
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

289
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We're continuing to make improvements to that voice,

290
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
but frankly, now I'm very accustomed to it.

291
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yeah.

292
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Poppy keeps talking to me every day.

293
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Fake Poppy.

294
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It kind of makes me want to be able to address the unit as Fake Poppy.

295
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You know?

296
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's...

297
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Phoebe.

298
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah.

299
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Phoebe.

300
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay, and also, I saw there's a Debian repo.

301
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh, I'm excited for that.

302
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That sounds great.

303
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So if I'm...

304
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What does this mean?

305
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Can you...

306
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Is it just now a couple of app sources away and now I can install all the Minecraft packages?

307
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So, yeah, we have an app repo.

308
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Aaron, our systems administrator, he's been on here before,

309
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
ran into a problem that he talked to the packaging community about.

310
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So I think that repo will probably be shared out, I would guess, tomorrow.

311
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, I don't know if you got the memo, Ryan.

312
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
We're all about snaps now, so not repos.

313
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
No, flat packs.

314
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, flat packs.

315
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah.

316
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No, snaps.

317
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I know.

318
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm very, very familiar with snaps.

319
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm very, very familiar now with flat pack.

320
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
We're playing around with those.

321
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
We have a snaps repo up where people can watch as we package that up.

322
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And at this point, we're just asking for help on all of our packaging.

323
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
We want to package in all of the different standards for every repo,

324
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
as I know that we've been talking a lot about lately with the universal...

325
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
all these different universal packaging...

326
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Solve, yeah, all these universal solve all problems standards,

327
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
which we're going to talk more about when we get to flat packs in a bit.

328
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But yeah, it's...

329
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But we're just trying to package Mycroft in as many...

330
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
get it to as many different people as possible, and that's kind of our focus.

331
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So if people in the Jupyter Broadcasting community want to help us do that,

332
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
that would be great.

333
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And then finally, we've got...

334
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
if you look at the bottom of the blog post,

335
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
which I hope that you'll post in the show notes,

336
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
there's a few other projects that we're working on.

337
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We're working on a community website

338
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
that has a lot of information for those who are interested

339
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
in contributing to the open source side of Mycroft.

340
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And then we're working on just all this stuff that you can see in GitHub

341
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
as far as, like, we have an issue tracker

342
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and we've just been throwing all of our ideas in there.

343
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And so we're really getting tons and tons of feedback,

344
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and lots of people are submitting front ends for Mycroft.

345
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
We now have a plasmoid...

346
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
a home extension, an Electron front end, an Android app.

347
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, cool. Oh, man.

348
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So it's coming in really, really fast, so fast, in fact,

349
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
that we're finding it really, really difficult to answer all the questions

350
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
as people charge ahead, but that's a great problem to have.

351
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You know what would be a killer feature in comparison to the Echo

352
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and probably even the Google Assistant and Siri is

353
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
if somehow all of these...

354
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
if I had it on an Android device on my desktop and in the hardware device,

355
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I know we've kind of mentioned this before,

356
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
but if somehow all of these were connected in some way

357
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
where if one of them learned something or could, like,

358
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
if I could, say, send a telegram to Wes to one of them,

359
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
all of them can have that functionality without me having to install an app

360
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
on each one or install a third-party feature on each one.

361
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Like, if at the end of it, you know, maybe it's a couple years down the road,

362
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
these different Mycroft endpoints all felt like a shared brain,

363
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
truly got us closer to Jarvis.

364
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Because right now, all the other AI assistants,

365
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
they're each their own individual thing.

366
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Like, if you're using Siri and you have an iPad and an iPhone

367
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and now you're going to have it on the Mac OS,

368
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
you literally, you could say, you know, hey, telephone,

369
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and it will, if they're all in the same proximity, they'll all light up

370
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and they'll all try to answer the question like a bunch of dummies

371
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
and each one of them doesn't have any idea that there's another instance

372
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
of it running.

373
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Now, I don't know what the solution is there, but if there was some way

374
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
to make it feel like one cohesive intelligent system, Ryan,

375
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
is that possible? Is that within Mycroft's future?

376
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah, it is.

377
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It was one of our day one features working on,

378
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
and we're still working to make it so that the units are aware of each other.

379
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They live in what we call a domain.

380
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
They're supposed to eventually have awareness of each other,

381
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
and if, for instance, two of them pick up the same thing,

382
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
go through some very, very quick election process to say,

383
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
you're getting the better stream, you're in a better position

384
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
to answer this question, you go ahead and do it.

385
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
And the other thing, too, is that we already have shared configuration

386
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
across instances.

387
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I have four Mycroft instances.

388
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
They're all in the same settings, and that's all done through our backend,

389
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
which is currently named Cerberus.

390
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
However, a lot of our backend stuff is going to be getting a really,

391
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
really big update soon, and so you'll see maybe that name go away

392
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and a true backend that really feels comfortable to use

393
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and is really a great user experience comes to the forefront.

394
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
We're super, super busy, but everything's going great,

395
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
and we're trying to build as many relationships right now

396
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
with folks who are packaging software and folks who are interested

397
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
in working on frontends for Mycroft to just let it permeate

398
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
to as many different places as possible and to make that process

399
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
of getting started with Mycroft that much easier.

400
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's great you guys are working on snaps.

401
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Do you know what it is in packages that started to land in the AUR?

402
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That'd be great, too.

403
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't know.

404
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
The thing is, every time I check out the AUR for a project that I work on,

405
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
someone has already beat me to it by the time I go to package stuff.

406
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So it wouldn't surprise me if there was already Mycroft in the AUR,

407
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
and I've got an Arch machine in front of me right now,

408
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
and I haven't taken the time to check, but it wouldn't surprise me at all.

409
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I've been working really, really hard on trying to help people

410
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
get the information they need to finish their frontends.

411
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I'm super interested in the GNOME extension and the Android app.

412
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah, that is looking really good.

413
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
So, Ryan, my last question.

414
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Are you ever going to make it out to Washington?

415
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Because we've got to Mycroft up the JB Studio like nuts.

416
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Yeah, I actually was just contemplating this the other day.

417
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Now that we've really got so much done, I'm interested to come out

418
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and not only hook up the JB Studio, but also Lady Jupiter with Mycroft.

419
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
We've got it controlling some things like the Nest

420
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
and some early smart things stuff and Philips Hue stuff,

421
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
so maybe we'll also have to see if we can figure out some smart things

422
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
to pimp your place out with.

423
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah, that's going to be so ridiculous, because I actually,

424
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
a couple of months down the road, am going to go on a road trip

425
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
to go to a developer summit, and I think I'm going to do

426
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
a Lady Jupiter technology rover log video for that.

427
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I probably should have just said that out loud, because now I have to do it.

428
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Damn it!

429
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Yeah, I'm wondering if we can put like a,

430
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
what's your internet connection like when you're in Lady Jupiter?

431
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It depends on where I'm at, very much.

432
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Anywhere from a megabit, you know, 700 kilobits a second

433
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
to up to 30, 40 megabits, depending on location.

434
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Well, the thing that we could do that I think would be really cool

435
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
is to take like a NUC and hide it somewhere in Lady Jupiter

436
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and then connect it to like this complex microphone system

437
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
throughout the thing, so it's just one brain all the time.

438
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You know what, I actually have a spot.

439
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
There is a spot underneath one of my seats,

440
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
there's an AC outlet underneath the seat, and it's an open space,

441
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
and I already have a Linux powered access point and router down there.

442
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So I was just planning to kind of expand that out,

443
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and I got a spot in there for a NUC already.

444
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
If we got a dedicated, somebody who's been working on an Electron app,

445
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
it'd be cool if you full screen that Electron app on like a display.

446
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Oh, totally.

447
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh, man.

448
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Totally, totally.

449
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Oh, man.

450
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Lady Jupes, you know what would be really cool is

451
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Lady Jupes has an outside outdoor television,

452
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
and so like when we go to like, you know, like summits and stuff.

453
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Lady Jupes played the live stream.

454
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah, put that up on the TV, on the outdoor TV.

455
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That would be really crazy cool.

456
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And actually, all the video is routed to a switcher,

457
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
so it would be no problem.

458
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
We just send the feed.

459
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah.

460
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's easy peasy.

461
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
So people want to know in the chat room,

462
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
is there anywhere that they can find the Android app yet?

463
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Is that out yet?

464
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
You can.

465
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I would tell everybody to go to the docs.microsoft.ai,

466
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
and there's a little contributing option there where you can see like

467
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
all the ways to get involved.

468
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And if you join either our IRC or our Slack channel,

469
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
we've been talking about it a lot lately,

470
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
and if you're a community member who's working on it,

471
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'm not entirely certain that he's popped it into the repo yet,

472
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
but I'll ask him because I know he's collaborating with somebody else

473
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
in the community, so they have to be collaborating somehow.

474
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So maybe it exists, and I just haven't gone and visited it yet.

475
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So it sounds like it's an open source Android app?

476
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah, yeah, and it runs the full stack on the device too.

477
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Wow.

478
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Like, my crop is running on the device.

479
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Holy crap.

480
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I want to try that.

481
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
It's not hitting an API or anything.

482
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We got a pull request a while back that took,

483
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
so this is a core on a Raspberry Pi, so bear this in mind.

484
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It took it down from using 100% of one core on a Raspberry Pi to less than 1%,

485
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
just based on improvements that we made to the listener.

486
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And so since we did that, we've been loading it on many, many small devices,

487
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and it's been flying.

488
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That's awesome.

489
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And a lot of phones, a lot of Android phones,

490
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
are actually more powerful than a Raspberry Pi.

491
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So from what I saw in the little demo video,

492
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and I'll try and share it with you,

493
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
because the guy recorded his son talking to his phone

494
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
and the Android app answering.

495
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Wow.

496
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It seemed to be running just fine.

497
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
That's amazing.

498
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So what you're telling me is you pulled a Richard,

499
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and you Pied Pipered this thing, and you went from like 99,

500
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and you just cut it.

501
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
That's an incredible reduction from maxing out a CPU core to 1% CPU usage.

502
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Now you just have Minecraft everywhere with me.

503
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
That's what you get for...

504
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It was a community member.

505
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
He now is an intern, but he wasn't at the time.

506
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Isn't that awesome?

507
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And so we can't really take...

508
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I mean, I guess we can take credit for it now that he works for us,

509
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
but at the time we couldn't.

510
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That's a huge benefit of being open source.

511
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Man, that feels good.

512
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Well, Ryan, thank you for the update.

513
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
And if you are able to stick around,

514
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
we will be getting into Flatpak and Snaps in a little bit,

515
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
and I'd love to hear some of your thoughts on that.

516
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
While you're just mentioning...

517
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Yeah, go ahead.

518
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I can say something that gets me yelled at.

519
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
That's what this show is for.

520
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I got to tell you, don't worry, nobody's listening,

521
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
nobody's going to comment afterwards.

522
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Certainly not.

523
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Don't have to worry about that at all, Ryan.

524
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
There's not even a subreddit for it.

525
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
There's not even a subreddit.

526
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
We were just talking about the Android phones.

527
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
OnePlus 3, you know, the new OnePlus phone,

528
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
which is just getting complicated.

529
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Very complicated.

530
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
OnePlus 3 looks like it's going to become

531
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
an unofficial Ubuntu phone, though.

532
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
There is some interest out there by the ubports.com folks,

533
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
a group of independent developers.

534
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
They're going to port Ubuntu Touch to the OnePlus 3.

535
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
This would make the Ubuntu Touch available on a very nice,

536
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
modern, capable, fast, and very well-reviewed smartphone.

537
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Considering a new smartphone, maybe the OnePlus 3

538
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
should be my future.

539
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Maybe, because it's getting really good reviews, too.

540
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I mean, I want convergence, right?

541
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Like, who doesn't?

542
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Well, we'll find out how Maru works on your phone

543
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
in just a little bit.

544
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Speaking of phones, let's also just take a moment right here.

545
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Guess who we're going to talk about, Wes.

546
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Do you have a guess?

547
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Ting.

548
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh, it's Ting.

549
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
That's right.

550
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Go over to Ting and check them out.

551
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Ting is a little different than anybody else.

552
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
They don't work like your regular cell phone provider.

553
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Ting keeps rates simple.

554
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
We don't make you pick a plan.

555
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Instead, you just use your phone as you normally would.

556
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
How much you use determines how much you pay each month.

557
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
All right.

558
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You can have as many devices as you want on one account.

559
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
That's good, because when you use more,

560
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
you pay less per minute, message, or megabyte of data.

561
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Is that math right?

562
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Your usage plus $6 per active device on your account

563
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
plus taxes is your monthly bill.

564
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Yeah, it is.

565
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Simple.

566
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That's what we mean when we say mobile.

567
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I get it.

568
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
That makes sense.

569
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yeah, it's your minutes, your message, your megabytes.

570
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
That's your Ting math.

571
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
And then it's $6 for the line.

572
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
And then whatever Uncle Sam's cut is right there.

573
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You see, you just got...

574
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Wes?

575
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Boom.

576
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
That is what you get right there.

577
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And I got to tell you, Wes, I was sort of all in on Ting

578
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
just because of the savings when I switched over.

579
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I was like, okay, well, that seems obvious.

580
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I want to pay less every month.

581
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Yeah.

582
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And I have Wi-Fi at home.

583
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I have Wi-Fi here at the studs.

584
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I have Wi-Fi at family member's house.

585
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I have Wi-Fi at, you know, there's Wi-Fi on the bus these days.

586
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Freaking McDonald's has freaking Wi-Fi.

587
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
So I was like, this is going to be great because I'll be able to game the system.

588
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So that was sort of what brought me over to Ting.

589
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But then what kept me at Ting, the first bit,

590
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
is I kept having these revelations about how they were actually a really cool company

591
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
and not just like a bullshit like, we're hip.

592
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
And so we do blog posts.

593
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
No, it's like actually there's really cool people and they really get it.

594
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And they really are not playing a gimmick.

595
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
They're not playing a game.

596
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
They don't have to wear a leather jacket and a pink shirt to get you to be convinced to switch over.

597
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
They just make a really simple mobile service.

598
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Every device they sell is unlocked and you own it.

599
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
The customer support, you get to talk to a real human being.

600
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
The control panel allows you to control all aspects of your phone.

601
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Oh, that control panel is awesome.

602
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It really is super good.

603
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
They're a store.

604
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You can buy SIM cards.

605
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You can buy feature phones.

606
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You can get the latest phones.

607
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You can bring your own.

608
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And they have GSM and a CDMA network for you to pick from.

609
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
If you're a small business, this is a no-brainer.

610
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Really, seriously, like independent surveys have been done, conducted.

611
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And not only, by the way, speaking of that, not only does Ting totally kick ass in consumer reports for their category of provider,

612
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I got to tell you what, nobody touches them when it comes to small business plans.

613
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
If you have like 10 devices and you bring them over, nobody's going to touch Ting.

614
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
You go 10 devices and more and it's nuts because it's $6 for each line.

615
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
A lot of places, the minimum is $15 a line, something like that.

616
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And in a business account, it could be even more.

617
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And that's even when they cut in some big scale deals.

618
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
$6 a line.

619
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
One line, 50 lines.

620
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
$6.

621
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
If you want to give somebody an emergency phone, it's $6.

622
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
CDMA and GSM, which means you can repurpose a lot of your existing phones that still work perfectly fine

623
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
or you can find a great phone off of eBay or buy one right from the Ting store.

624
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Go get it from Google Play.

625
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Great controls, great customer service.

626
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It's a really good service.

627
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I think everything about Ting is top and tops.

628
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And they really do actually have a good blog.

629
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
They constantly are posting interesting stuff there too.

630
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You can check that out.

631
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
If you start by going to linux.ting.com, you support this show.

632
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You can try out their savings calculator and just use that as a litmus test.

633
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Does this work for you?

634
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
It might not.

635
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And that's why they have the savings calculator.

636
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
You can just figure that out right there.

637
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You don't need to waste your time or Ting's time.

638
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Just try the savings calculator.

639
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That won't take long.

640
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Linux.ting.com and then if it does look like it's going to work, like for me, I end up saving like $2,000 every two years.

641
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Linux.ting.com.

642
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
That's crazy.

643
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Take $25 off your first device or if you bring a device, you'll get service credit, which will probably pay for more than your first month.

644
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Linux.ting.com.

645
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Thank you, Ting.

646
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
All right.

647
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
So before we go any further, let's take a little break.

648
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Refresh with a free game.

649
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Oh, is that a Linux game I see?

650
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yes, it is.

651
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And it's a good one too.

652
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I already own this game.

653
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I got it on sale during the sale, but it's a limbo, which the thing that really stands out about limbo is it's sort of a platformer.

654
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So you have to like the side scrolling platformers, but it's not like a lot of colors and a lot of whiz bang.

655
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's beautiful.

656
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,000
It's dark and it's moody and it's mysterious and it uses lighting and shadows in a way that really no other game has ever before or has since.

657
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And it's exceedingly beautiful and also very reasonable to play even like on an Intel chipset.

658
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And it works great with the controller.

659
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's a great SteamOS game.

660
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
It's been out since 2011.

661
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
So it's not like it's brand new, but it's one of these overwhelmingly positively reviewed games.

662
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It really is.

663
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
People love it.

664
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And it's freaking free right now.

665
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Can't be free.

666
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Yeah.

667
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
If you're listening to the show for the next couple of days, it is free right now and you can find it in the show notes.

668
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So I think that's just really super cool.

669
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Look at that.

670
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Did you see that huge creepy spider?

671
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
That thing is just...

672
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Man, that always creeps my kids out.

673
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
They love this game because it's slightly creepy.

674
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So they love that.

675
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
All right.

676
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
So I believe Mr. Ikey is in the Mumble Room.

677
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And that just happens to work out great because a brand new release of Solus is out.

678
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
1.2.

679
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Don't call it 1.2 though.

680
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Call it Shannon.

681
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
And it is looking good.

682
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I've heard people talk...

683
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
People have been talking about the boot speed this morning.

684
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
This is what the chat room is saying this morning as I was setting up.

685
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
They say, Wes, that new SolOS sure boots fast.

686
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I've never seen a distro boot that fast before.

687
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
That's what the chat room is saying.

688
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So Ikey, you're doing something right.

689
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
What's new and notable in the new shiny release?

690
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Ikey, I don't hear you.

691
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Did he leave?

692
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
No.

693
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Ikey, that's your cue.

694
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Somebody bring Ikey back.

695
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Somebody bring Ikey back.

696
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I don't even see him.

697
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Hey, Wes.

698
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Where's Ikey?

699
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I don't know.

700
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Jeez, Louise.

701
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
But I do want to give this 1.2 Shannon a try.

702
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah, it does look nice.

703
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Although, this is such a good setup to have a fail like that.

704
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I just feel like now I don't want to talk about it.

705
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I mean, that was like...

706
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I think that was my best setup of the show.

707
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What do you think?

708
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
You think that was my best setup of the show?

709
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You've peaked, Chris.

710
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah.

711
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I think I peaked and then the payoff wasn't there.

712
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Hi.

713
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Sorry.

714
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
The man of the hour.

715
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So how's audio working on SolOS, Ikey?

716
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Audio is working fine.

717
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
It's great.

718
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's great.

719
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So it turns out like I spent ages earlier setting up this mouse because it's got all

720
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
these buttons.

721
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I thought, I'm going to set that mouse button up there and I'm going to use that one for

722
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Mumble and I'm not going to forget which one it is.

723
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
There's three of them, not two.

724
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So I'm here now.

725
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
No worries.

726
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I actually gave me a chance to have a little fun.

727
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So what is the new shiny in the big release here?

728
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So I mean, where do we start?

729
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I mean, we're 20 days late and I can only apologize for that to people.

730
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Oh, so you guys are copying Fedora, huh?

731
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
What does it say?

732
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Yeah.

733
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I mean, it basically turned out the same time as them and before Half Life 3.

734
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
So I'd say, you know, we're doing all right there.

735
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Yeah, yeah.

736
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
It's both a difference.

737
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
It's good.

738
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Yeah.

739
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I mean, it was later than I anticipated, but I mean, I've not been too well myself lately,

740
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
but we made it.

741
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It represents over three months of work, over 150 bugs fixed, a completely new replacement

742
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Steam runtime and the Linux Steam integration with roughly 160 of the libraries that we've

743
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
enabled for Steam now being optimized as well.

744
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Yeah, we got the epic boot time, obviously.

745
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It's been a massive, massive release.

746
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So tell me a little bit about this Steam stuff because I got a little wind of this earlier.

747
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And I don't really – I'm not hip with the Steam stuff, but here's my rough understanding

748
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:17,000
of Nike is if you got all the necessary libraries that all the different games need, if you

749
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
use the more modern versions that come with current distros, you often get better performance,

750
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,000
less problems than using the prepackaged Ubuntu runtime libraries that are based on an old

751
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
version of Ubuntu that come with Steam itself.

752
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
And so I guess some people prefer to use the runtime libraries, some people prefer to use

753
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
native libraries, and you guys have tried to solve this problem.

754
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Am I tracking?

755
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it.

756
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I mean, I know that you yourself go between Fedora and Arch and so you've probably seen

757
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
some of the Steam issues yourself.

758
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:56,000
On Ubuntu, I mean, people tend to get it easy on Ubuntu up until about 16.04.

759
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I was going to say 16.10.

760
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That's not happened yet.

761
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
But these libraries are like from Ubuntu 12.04.

762
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So, I mean, in Linux terms, they are crusty.

763
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
These are really, really old libraries that are built specifically for Ubuntu.

764
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I mean, we're talking about libraries that just don't exist in other distributions.

765
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
They've got different soul names.

766
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You've got like curl, GNU, TLS, which are specific Ubuntu and Debian things.

767
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
So, what we decided to do is like, okay, one, this is nonsense, right?

768
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
We build Solace and we optimize it for our users.

769
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's like, okay, so if we're going to have to do some hacks here to get it to work, well,

770
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
we're going to make sure we do it properly.

771
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So, we took what would constitute the full runtime and just started building everything

772
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and disabled Steam from running its own runtime.

773
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So, we've got something called Linux Steam Integration, which basically replaces user bin Steam.

774
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So, this shim will run instead of that.

775
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
And we made sure it doesn't leak or anything like that.

776
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And it replaces itself with the Steam process afterwards.

777
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
So, when we disable their runtime and we use ours, you actually get nice integration.

778
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
So, you'll actually see things like font config is actually working.

779
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
You get all the right font rendering come through.

780
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I don't know if you guys have seen it on Archer and other distros, but you'll see the font

781
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
are ever so slightly out of line.

782
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The buttons along the top of Steam, they're all kind of drunk as well.

783
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So, it fixes those issues.

784
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
The tray will be natively themed as well, which it's those little touches which really,

785
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
really help.

786
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But the main thing really was the performance.

787
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Those were advantages that came afterwards.

788
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,000
You can disable our runtime and forcibly use Steams because ours is new.

789
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
There's going to be things we haven't tested yet.

790
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:52,000
We were responsible and tested 100 titles in the first 24 hours.

791
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It was our duty, right?

792
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But that also sounds like a good idea just from, you could see some game developer go,

793
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
oh yeah, well, that distribution's doing their own weird thing with Steam.

794
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So, that gives the person a reset button to say, okay, well, I'm testing it with the native

795
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
runtime and I'm still having the problem.

796
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Yeah, that's true.

797
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Yeah, I mean, they can do either way.

798
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
There's even a third option if you like.

799
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So, one of the games, well, there was two of them.

800
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Counter-Strike Go wasn't working for me.

801
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I don't remember if you guys saw the update a couple of weeks ago.

802
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Basically, something went wrong when they suddenly switched it to use 64-bit only on

803
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
CSGO.

804
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It still shipped with the 32-bit version.

805
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So, I thought, aha.

806
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So, I added a tweak in there, which you know when you run things via the Linux 32 command

807
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
line, it basically forces things into a 32-bit environment.

808
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
So, I added that support inside of LSI.

809
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
So, Steam will then be tricked into running only 32-bit versions of the applications.

810
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,000
So, what that does is for CSGO, I'm able to use the native runtime in 32-bit mode.

811
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And for Goat Simulator, a very serious strategy game, you're able to run that in 32-bit with

812
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Steam's runtime because that uses some special Nvidia physics libraries.

813
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You are doing the Lord's work there.

814
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
That's great.

815
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
It's, you know, somebody's got to do these things, right?

816
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Why not me?

817
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So, that's all coming in, the new update.

818
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And so, along with that, do you package it all up with like an update mechanism or is

819
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
it sort of a nuke and pave process?

820
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
No, I mean, people can update.

821
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So, in terms of the packages that have already got installed in the system, those will change,

822
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
right?

823
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So, whatever updates you got through there, like security updates and things like that,

824
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
those are going to come through.

825
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Between Solus 1.1 and 1.2, we decided to change how we put certain packages together.

826
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
New distributions are coming out and they're starting to use Budgie and we thought, well,

827
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
maybe those patches we've been doing aren't quite the best approach.

828
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
So, we'll try and set an example, show people how you can actually ship a distribution or

829
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
an operating system just to be pedantic and show them how you can actually have all the

830
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
presets in place and how you do the configuration.

831
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So, we added a couple of packages.

832
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,000
One of them is Solus Hardware Config, which takes care of certain mouse configurations

833
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
like the RAT5 mouse and things like this and Budgie Desktop Branding, which contains all

834
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
of the live CD configuration and all the tweaks that are needed for Gsens for basically the

835
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Budgie experience we now offer.

836
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
So, those don't come through as an update.

837
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
They're basically going to have to be opt-in.

838
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So, the package selection is very much dependent on the ISO you downloaded.

839
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
You can upgrade and install those things as well.

840
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
But if you're already in 1.1, you'll just get the normal updates that come through.

841
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Of course, you're still going to get all the optimizations that come through for all the

842
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
lower libraries as well.

843
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So, you will still benefit.

844
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It just won't look exactly the same or won't have exactly the same software installed.

845
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
It's easy to do, though.

846
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
That sounds like a lot of thought is going into every single thing about this release.

847
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Is there something that you work on that you think a lot about that you assume probably

848
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
people don't even notice?

849
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Like, is there something in here that people miss?

850
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Like, what is it?

851
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Like, I always know when there's something I work on, there's something that I just sweat

852
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
the details on.

853
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And then after I'm done, I'm like, did anybody actually even notice that?

854
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Yeah.

855
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Well, I mean, it's going to be that way for me for a lot of things.

856
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I mean, you know yourself.

857
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Once you put something out, like you say, you sweat on something, it's not so much when

858
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
someone doesn't notice that as they notice something far more insignificant.

859
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Yeah.

860
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And that's the killer.

861
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So, I mean, not as insignificant.

862
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So, we've had a bit of a UX update.

863
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
We've actually been lucky enough.

864
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I mean, I think you guys know yourselves, but the guy behind the Arc theme, Horst3180,

865
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
we've worked directly with him for a long time now.

866
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And with him, we actually just redesigned the budget desktop.

867
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
And that's how budget desktop 10 came around, like designed by the theme author.

868
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Wow.

869
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah.

870
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
So, like it was actually called Arc Desktop for a long time.

871
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Yeah.

872
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Okay.

873
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
That was the code name.

874
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
He's helped us a lot more with getting things together this time.

875
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
And we now have the Arc icon theme as well.

876
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So, within 40 minutes of it having a Git repo, it was the default in Solus.

877
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
He'd be on all the cards for a while.

878
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Sam Hewitt has also helped us a lot with UX design this time around.

879
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I mean, you all know Sam.

880
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Sam, I don't know.

881
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I probably know him by a handle.

882
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I probably don't know him by Sam.

883
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So, Sam Hewitt, the guy behind the paper theme.

884
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Oh, okay.

885
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yeah, yeah, okay.

886
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Yeah, that guy.

887
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Right?

888
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That guy.

889
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Yeah.

890
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
So, he's helped us with designing the software center, giving like little hints and tips

891
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
and fixes and mock-ups for that, as well as the installer itself.

892
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So, how has adoption been?

893
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Adoption?

894
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I haven't a clue.

895
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
When did we release?

896
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Early yesterday?

897
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Well, I just mean as a whole.

898
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I don't mean one particular release.

899
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I mean, as a community, you get a sense that there's growth there, that things are picking

900
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
up.

901
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
But what is your sense?

902
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Yeah, I mean, definitely.

903
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
There's a lot of people really now starting to get it.

904
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I mean, Solus goes against the grain in so many ways.

905
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And it's never easy to explain exactly in one sentence to people.

906
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
It's like, you know, this is what Solus does.

907
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And they're like, well, why not use Ubuntu, Stora, Debian, insert something here?

908
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:50,000
It's like, because kill me if you want, but I don't think it works.

909
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
We have to do some...

910
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
There's so many things that we do that are so fundamentally different that we couldn't

911
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
do as a downstream.

912
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
So, explaining those things, but people are now realizing that.

913
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
And you do see comments now.

914
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
People are like, I can actually see why you did this from scratch.

915
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Like it was designed to avoid the problems in the first place.

916
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Like, it's not like we're somehow superior to or holier than other people.

917
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
We've taken that experience, and I've taken my own experience in doing this as well, and

918
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
folded it into something new.

919
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That's pretty cool.

920
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And I think it always, after we chat, it always makes me want to download it.

921
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So, I'll download the new release and give it an install.

922
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'm looking forward to that.

923
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
So, I always like using something.

924
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
There's a lot of thought and intention that goes into it.

925
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Yeah.

926
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Well, Aiki, thanks for the update.

927
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Anything else you want to touch on?

928
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Maybe that crazy mouse?

929
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I don't know.

930
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Okay.

931
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
No, I mean, no, because it only fires things up.

932
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You are welcome to stick around.

933
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I know, I think I saw you mention something on Google+.

934
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You're getting lots of questions about snaps in Solace.

935
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
So, if you want to stick around for that discussion coming up in a few minutes, you are welcome.

936
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Okay.

937
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I'll bite.

938
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Excellent.

939
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Just really quick, I just wanted to give a mention because it's happening right now as

940
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
we record the show.

941
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
DockerCon is going on, and they're integrating something that I'm hoping Wes can explain

942
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
to me what it is, because I think it's kind of a big deal.

943
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Docker is integrating orchestration right into the core Docker engine with their new

944
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
release.

945
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
This is some of the big news that's coming out of DockerCon going on in Seattle.

946
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
So, Wes, you've seen probably some of the shenanigans as a result of DockerCon.

947
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I've certainly seen a lot of people with really cute little whales walking around, which,

948
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
hey, that's not bad.

949
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah.

950
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So, you've probably seen all of the DockerCon traffic.

951
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
So, container orchestration, if I'm understanding what that there means, Wes, now, you'll have

952
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
to forgive me.

953
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I haven't been a sys admin for a couple of years now, but that's another fancy way of

954
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
saying like a framework to manage all of your containers and spin them up on different machines

955
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
and shut them down and delete them and version them and standardize them and things like

956
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
that, correct?

957
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Yeah.

958
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
So, it's like, as they say here, container orchestration is what is needed to transition

959
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
from deploying containers individually on a single host to deploying complex multi-container

960
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
apps on many machines.

961
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Yeah, okay.

962
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
So, yeah, as you're growing your cloud, maybe you're on other people's infrastructure, you're

963
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
on your own infrastructure, you need something that will help you take your single little

964
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Docker instances and actually scale them, make sure they fit into the roles, integrate

965
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
with your configuration management.

966
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
There's a lot of ways to do this and now there's something built right into Docker.

967
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I can even see a scenario where you have four or five digital ocean droplets that you spin

968
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
up containers on demand for, like I would just be playing with Fedora 23 today.

969
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
So, to me, it seems like what Docker just announced is they're going to take a huge

970
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
part of the Docker ecosystem and integrate it into the core functionality of Docker.

971
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Like, last time I was at DockerCon was last year around this time.

972
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:56,000
It was LinuxCon DockerCon and the number one industry at DockerCon is container management

973
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and orchestration of containers.

974
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,000
And they just announced they're integrating that into the core.

975
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I read about it.

976
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
It's some badass stuff.

977
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,000
It allows you to do swarms of Docker containers with just a couple of commands and set up

978
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
clustered Docker containers with a few more commands and you don't really have to really

979
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
worry about any of the, quote unquote, you don't have to worry about it, quote unquote,

980
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
underlying technology.

981
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
And they're building that in the core Docker using just a Docker command line.

982
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I mean, this is like a massive thing.

983
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Right.

984
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
So, we'll probably see it rolling out and everywhere.

985
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
I haven't played with it yet, so it'll be interesting.

986
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I don't know how we'll see, like, will other people adopt it, will it be wrapped around

987
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
by other systems like Kubernetes or all that kind of stuff?

988
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Right.

989
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah.

990
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That's a good point.

991
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So, we'll just be watching and see what happens.

992
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I don't know.

993
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
That's probably all we really need to talk about here on this show, I imagine.

994
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I don't know.

995
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
But I'm sure there's lots of news.

996
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I looked over the talks.

997
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
There's a lot of interesting stuff.

998
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Microsoft's giving a talk about how the containers on Windows are going, if that's your thing.

999
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
You know what I really don't like about them?

1000
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So, I've been following the DockerCon thing just to see if there's stuff for us to talk

1001
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
about.

1002
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And so, I saw the Microsoft talk.

1003
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
And you know what the really arrogant thing about the Microsoft talk was?

1004
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Is Microsoft positioned their entire talk as, well, now that Microsoft's getting involved

1005
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
with Docker containers, now Docker's coming to the enterprise.

1006
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Now it's production ready.

1007
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Now Docker's production ready.

1008
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Meanwhile, those SOBs are running it in a virtualizer on their Windows platform.

1009
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
It's not even a true container.

1010
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Like, they're such a bunch of posers.

1011
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
They're so desperate to make their Windows platform relevant that they're bending over

1012
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,000
backwards to make Linux containers run on their platform as easy and thinly as possible

1013
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
using their virtualizer.

1014
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And then, they have the sack to say, well, now Docker's arrived at the enterprise.

1015
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I will say the Mac support is kind of neat, just that they're using XHive, which is ported

1016
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
over from our friends at FreeBSD, which is pretty neat.

1017
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Isn't it interesting to see one of the first things that Beehive does in a large production

1018
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,000
scale is bring Docker containers to the Mac.

1019
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.

1020
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Full circle, everyone.

1021
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Full circle.

1022
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Welcome to BSD Unplugged.

1023
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
You know, it's just one of those things.

1024
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It just happens.

1025
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Okay, so.

1026
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Oh, man.

1027
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Yeah, you know, speaking of Beehive, it just got Windows video support, so you can VNC

1028
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
into that thing.

1029
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
You don't have to do it over a serial console.

1030
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Yeah.

1031
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
That's a big usability win.

1032
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Speaking of DigitalOcean, let's take a moment and talk about DigitalOcean.

1033
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
You've got a container you want to deploy.

1034
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Do it over at DigitalOcean.

1035
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Now, we've been talking about Docker, but Wes here, you do LXD containers in production

1036
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
on DigitalOcean.

1037
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And what do you like about the LXD containers over the Docker containers?

1038
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Well, you know, they're just a little more familiar.

1039
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I mean, Docker works well if I was, you know, making maybe like a big fleet of microservices

1040
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
and using orchestration tools and that sort of thing.

1041
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Docker may be something I would look to be using.

1042
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
LXD containers are nice because they really act a lot more like VMs, which is something

1043
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I'm familiar with.

1044
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And I get all of my regular Linux tools for admin, right?

1045
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
So, like, I know how to use like SystemD and journal control and all that kind of stuff

1046
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
to manage services, et cetera.

1047
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
It's all the same tools, and then I can just spin them up, transfer them from server to

1048
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,000
server.

1049
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
So, it's simpler in some regards.

1050
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Make copies, take snapshots.

1051
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
It's very simple.

1052
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
And if you don't need a huge enterprise-grade thing, you just want a few containers.

1053
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yeah.

1054
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
You know, I basically set up a system, turn it into an image.

1055
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I can then just update the image when I need to.

1056
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I can transfer it and then just make as many images as I want.

1057
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Are there LXD container images like there are Docker?

1058
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Like, could I go grab a pre-setup LXD container to be lazy, or does it pretty much build it

1059
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
from scratch each time?

1060
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Well, so they are like actual image files, right?

1061
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
So, like, they're tarred up file systems.

1062
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Okay.

1063
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
So, they send these on the file system as an image.

1064
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Oh, okay.

1065
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
And then are there – is there like a place you can find pre-built ones?

1066
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yeah.

1067
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So, they have like a repository, and then you can also – the nice part is that they

1068
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
all have a REST API, and then they'll all just – you can like – if you have your

1069
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
own, you can then share images with any two servers that you want to let talk to each

1070
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
other.

1071
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Oh.

1072
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It's also really easy to make.

1073
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Like, you pretty much just take any install that you want, and you can trim it down,

1074
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
you know, uninstall packages or build it up minimally.

1075
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And then the format's really easy.

1076
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It's like you make two tar files.

1077
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
One's metadata.

1078
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
One's the file system.

1079
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You run, like, load it into an image.

1080
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
That's nice.

1081
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And then you can use it.

1082
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So, what's the process like of getting LXD running on a droplet on DigitalOcean?

1083
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Well, use like Ubuntu 16.04 when it's there by default, and then –

1084
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh, so it's like sex.

1085
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Type LXC.

1086
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Yeah, right.

1087
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Pretty much, right?

1088
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Type LXC, and then it generates a client certificate, and then you can get started and –

1089
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Nice.

1090
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So, you can pretty much do like LXC launch Ubuntu, I think.

1091
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Huh.

1092
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
You know, I think I'm going to play with that for a bit, because I was messing around

1093
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
with Docker, but I was on Fedora.

1094
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
But I was messing around with Docker, and it did feel like it was way more than I needed,

1095
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
really.

1096
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So, that's interesting that you say that.

1097
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So, you go over to DigitalOcean, and if you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED – DOUNPLUGGED,

1098
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
one word lowercase – that'll give us a little bit of support, a little bit of like,

1099
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
hey, yeah, that unplugged show is sending traffic our way.

1100
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
That keeps us going.

1101
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
But it also gives you a $10 credit, and you can try out like a droplet for a while.

1102
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:59,000
They have hourly pricing, so the droplet you may use may not need to be on all the time.

1103
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
And then that $5 – or they have a $5 a month if you want to just run it for a month or

1104
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
whatever.

1105
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Like, they have a really flexible pricing structure.

1106
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
So, the $10 credit could actually get you quite a bit of distance.

1107
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
All their rigs have SSDs, so it's a nice, fast I.O.

1108
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
They have data centers all over the world.

1109
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
They run Linux for the host.

1110
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
KVM for the virtualizer.

1111
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
40 gigabit connections into the hypervisors.

1112
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Tier 1 bandwidth at the data centers and the best interface.

1113
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I mean – and it's not even like a good interface for a web application.

1114
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,000
It is a good interface for managing this.

1115
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
You know what was sweet is today when I was – I decided to install a whole bunch of

1116
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
crap on this Fedora droplet that I have.

1117
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:49,000
And it was really super, super nice to just go in there and have the HTML5 console pop

1118
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
up.

1119
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
And I was able to watch the console spit out information while I'm SSHed in.

1120
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So, my SSH session feels fast and native and just – in fact, sometimes I even use Mosh.

1121
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Oh, yeah.

1122
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Totally.

1123
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Yeah.

1124
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Which really makes it feel like I'm sitting right there.

1125
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
But then to still have like the – to have it in a separate window on my second monitor,

1126
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
the console of the droplet is just the best, dude.

1127
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I love the –

1128
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
You know if you break anything.

1129
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,000
It's just right there.

1130
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,000
And it took four seconds to reassign a DNS hostname to the Fedora.

1131
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
It's like I was like, you know, I want to change the name of this Fedora machine.

1132
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
So, I used hostctl, hostnamectl or whatever it is.

1133
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Is that hostnamectl to set the hostname?

1134
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
And I set the machine name and the icon name.

1135
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And then in DigitalOcean, I just copy and paste just because over the interface, when

1136
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
you hover over the IP, it gives you the option to copy the IP right.

1137
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
So, boom, boom, pasted, updated the A record, and because the DNS was already pointing to

1138
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
DigitalOcean's name servers, it was SSHed immediately.

1139
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
And I was up and working.

1140
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
I'm installing, just experimenting.

1141
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I'm hoping to eventually get like a nice secure open source location tracking program that

1142
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
we can have for family members.

1143
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
And also when production – like during Linux Fest, we can have like crew members install

1144
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
it if they want.

1145
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Totally.

1146
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
They're on their way.

1147
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Yeah, exactly.

1148
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
But I don't want to use any hosted service, and so I wanted a rig to try these out on.

1149
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And to be able to install these different packages and stuff, the faster you're going

1150
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
to access that HTML5 console, it's a great setup.

1151
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Plus, you can take snapshots if you need to.

1152
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I did.

1153
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
If you're worried about breaking it, you're just like, boom.

1154
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I did.

1155
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Peace of mind.

1156
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Yep.

1157
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
DO Unplugged to get the credit and support this show.

1158
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
So, tell me about Meru, which seems to promise real big, Wes.

1159
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
For those of you out there that aren't familiar with it, their tagline is, your phone is your

1160
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
PC.

1161
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Now available for the Nexus 5, it's a new kind of computing experience.

1162
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
We've talked about it in the past.

1163
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It's based on Debian, and supposedly it's context aware.

1164
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
You plug it into a big monitor, and boom, you get a big old Linux desktop.

1165
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Is it true?

1166
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
In my experience so far, I mean, it hasn't been perfect, and I haven't tried it extensively,

1167
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
but I do have it running right here on my phone.

1168
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So, is it an app on Android that runs in a virtual environment?

1169
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I mean, so is that Android I'm seeing right now, or is that the phone UI?

1170
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
That's Android, but that's Meru OS.

1171
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
So, it looks just like what we're seeing in the video right now, is exactly what I'm seeing.

1172
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I have multi-ROM, so I just booted right into it.

1173
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So, this is Meru OS running Android?

1174
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I think it is Android.

1175
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I thought it was Debian-based.

1176
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
It may just launch through Debian, New Zealand.

1177
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I'm not actually sure how it works.

1178
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Okay, so how do I initiate a different desktop experience?

1179
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Unfortunately, I don't think we can without the right cable, which I do have.

1180
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
That makes sense.

1181
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,000
So, if we want to set up a demo, I can film it and upload it.

1182
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

1183
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Because, of course, you'd have to plug it in, right?

1184
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
But you plug it in, and it just, you know, XFCE desktop launches.

1185
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
You need like a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, which I tested.

1186
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,000
There's some problems, and I did run into this, where the Bluetooth mouse is like a little laggy.

1187
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
They suggest just turning it off and on or turning Bluetooth off and on.

1188
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
That did not fix it for me.

1189
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I have not been able to fix it, but I have not tried that much.

1190
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,000
So, it may already be fixed, or it may just be something I need to configure.

1191
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
But the keyboard worked perfectly.

1192
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It was otherwise, it was like fast, it was responsive.

1193
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I've seen some videos of people using Blender, using GIMP.

1194
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:17,000
So, it appears to be running Android 5.1, and it says is Maru on the Nexus 5 is the version, version 0.2.3.

1195
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Kernel version 3.4.0, GEAA 8415.

1196
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And so, it's very much right now a pure Android experience.

1197
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So, it does mean you've now had to downgrade from Marshmallow to Android 5.

1198
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:40,000
But in exchange, without a reboot, you plug in the HDMI cable to this son of a gun,

1199
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,000
and you're telling me it instantly expands to an XFCE desktop.

1200
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Because this is not an XFCE launcher on the phone right now.

1201
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
And what happens on the phone screen?

1202
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
It stays, you can use the phone too.

1203
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
You can use both at the same time.

1204
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
So, Android remains running on the phone.

1205
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Yep.

1206
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
So, it must be an Android app then.

1207
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
And so, you usually just want it to go fall asleep.

1208
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
What do they call that?

1209
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Doze?

1210
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Yeah.

1211
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
And so, it'll keep everything on.

1212
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Otherwise, if you explicitly lock it, it can sometimes trigger the screen saver in the other window.

1213
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
But otherwise, it really works very well.

1214
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
So, in what scenario could this actually be practical?

1215
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Because here we are, you wanted to show it to me, and yet, without the hardware, you can't actually do anything.

1216
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
So, you have to have the cable.

1217
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Everywhere.

1218
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
You have to have the port cable.

1219
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Everywhere you go, you'd have to have somewhere to plug that into.

1220
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Yep.

1221
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
So, you also have to have an external monitor ready to go.

1222
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
And a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.

1223
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Yep.

1224
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Those two are fairly easy, and I suppose you might have them anyway if you have a tablet or something.

1225
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:42,000
This is starting to seem extremely, I mean, now that you actually have to live with this in practice,

1226
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,000
all the dependencies to actually be able to use this as a desktop machine is really kind of making it limited.

1227
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Because at some point, you're going to go, well, I could also just go get a Chromebook.

1228
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,000
You could just get a Chromebook, especially now that they're running the Android apps.

1229
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Yeah.

1230
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
You know, and I haven't tried it that much, and you are kind of surrendering, like,

1231
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
if you're not going to go to the trouble of having a computer and you're just using your phone,

1232
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,000
and you bring your phone to work, and then you plug your phone into your keyboard and monitor,

1233
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
then you're left with the computing power of the phone.

1234
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Here's what I would rather have for me.

1235
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I would rather have a really easy image that allows me to run Google's version of Android

1236
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
so I can get my monthly security updates.

1237
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
That's why I buy a Nexus phone.

1238
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And then I would like something like multi-ROM, but maybe like a fork of it or something,

1239
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:35,000
that easily reboots me into another OS that can still access the Android data or something to that degree.

1240
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Oh, yeah.

1241
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Because I don't want to forfeit having modern Android.

1242
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
At the same time, it's probably only, now that you mention this,

1243
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
it's only like a couple of work case scenarios.

1244
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
At best, Wes, you could have a dock and a keyboard and a mouse at work,

1245
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
and a dock and a keyboard and a mouse at home, and you could go between home and work.

1246
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
But it's not like you're going to go to a coffee shop and use it.

1247
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
You're not coming here to the studio and using it unless you put a dock here.

1248
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Really, at a certain point, the overhead of having to just reboot into a dedicated OS

1249
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
that is designed for a desktop computer, I don't know.

1250
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
And all I'm doing is using my phone all day, which is like,

1251
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I have a lot more powerful computers I'd probably want to use.

1252
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
But it is an interesting idea.

1253
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And the performance is better than you thought.

1254
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I mean, XFCE doesn't really need that much, but it was working fine.

1255
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I haven't installed a lot.

1256
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I haven't tried taxing it.

1257
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I'm going to try to play with it more this weekend.

1258
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Anybody in the Mumble Room have any questions for Wes's test drive with Maroo OS?

1259
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I guess, yeah, NorthRanger, you were going to say, what's the point of having to reboot?

1260
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Yeah, I mean, Android is running a Linux kernel.

1261
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Is it really that much overhead having the extra Android user land kind of shoved to the side

1262
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,000
if you're ultimately booting up an X server and running a desktop shell anyway?

1263
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Probably not.

1264
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
It probably depends on how they do it.

1265
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I'll have to do some more research to see what I can find out.

1266
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
And it only supports the Nexus 5 at this point, which is kind of a bummer because...

1267
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Yeah, I mean, I like it.

1268
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
It's working for me, but it's definitely feeling old.

1269
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Yeah.

1270
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,000
So does this change your anticipation at all one way or the other for a Ubuntu phone?

1271
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
So you mentioned getting the OnePlus 3 because, you know, you were thinking maybe upgrading in the future.

1272
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Yeah, I'm thinking about that, yeah.

1273
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Now that you've tried this, has this chilled your opinion of convergence at all?

1274
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I mean, I think I'm still waiting for, like you said, I'm waiting for the real use case in my life.

1275
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I did have a really powerful device, and I did have, you know...

1276
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
There's just a lot of things to bring around.

1277
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
You can't carry a screen, a keyboard, and a mouse with you and the cable everywhere you go.

1278
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
One use case I could maybe think of is, like, my wife, for instance, she's an artist,

1279
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
so she has a little Cintiq small screen that she carries around with her.

1280
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
That might be something, if you could connect it to something like that,

1281
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
where you're already carrying around a screen for some reason, maybe in that case, but that's pretty niche.

1282
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
N3, you had a question?

1283
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Yeah, is it running mirror?

1284
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Oh yeah, did we figure out what the Linux display manager was?

1285
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I didn't see anything on their website about it.

1286
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
There's not that much information on the website.

1287
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
There is a Google group for development.

1288
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Yeah, I don't think they actually have the info,

1289
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
but we will link to the page if you guys want to dig through it.

1290
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And then I saw JM, you had a question.

1291
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
JMBBBBZ, go ahead.

1292
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
BBZ.

1293
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Yeah, can you make phone calls and text and things when you're in desktop mode, when you're docked?

1294
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I have not tried a phone call, but texting, I've been using other apps.

1295
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
That stuff all seems to work fine.

1296
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Yeah, it's the full Android OS.

1297
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
So if people have more questions, too, I'll be happy to film a little thing

1298
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
or film me using it or stress testing it if there's things people want me to try.

1299
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Is it Google Apps on there?

1300
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Not yet. It's pretty minimal.

1301
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
It looks like here I'm reading a thread right now on how to get the Google Apps on there, though.

1302
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
In fact, it's interesting.

1303
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
It's kind of revealing on how they do this.

1304
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Does it feel kind of snappy when you're using it in desktop mode,

1305
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
or does it feel like you're running off a phone?

1306
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
It really didn't feel very laggy.

1307
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I mean, the mouse was lagging a little bit, but I pulled up a terminal, I was browsing the web.

1308
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
That part wasn't laggy at all.

1309
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
It is. There is. Oh, boy.

1310
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
You know, the Motorola laptop is really the best scenario.

1311
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
That's really what you need is something like that.

1312
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
You can still find them on eBay every now and then, but that would make that.

1313
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
If you had something that was in your bag that was lightweight,

1314
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
that extra battery, LCD screen and a keyboard.

1315
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Yes, exactly. They're out there.

1316
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
You should have the Motorola laptops out there.

1317
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
All right, so any other notes on the Meru or any other questions?

1318
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
No? All right.

1319
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Then we shall move forward because I do want to talk about the snaps and flat packs here for a second.

1320
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
But before we go any further, let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy.

1321
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
LinuxAcademy.com is where you go.

1322
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,000
That's a platform to learn more about Linux and the technology around it.

1323
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Not just Linux itself, although that's a huge part of Linux Academy,

1324
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
and not just the core essentials and all the expert things around it.

1325
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Yes, all that stuff. Yes, it's true. It's true.

1326
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
But also a lot of projects built around it.

1327
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,000
So things like Ruby or things like NGINX or things that are tangently related,

1328
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
like the entire OpenStack setup or Amazon Web Services.

1329
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
This is all different aspects. And even to that end,

1330
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,000
now Linux Academy is introducing Microsoft Azure Essentials.

1331
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
How about that? Because you know what?

1332
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Azure is a competitive cloud computing platform that runs a whole ton of Linux.

1333
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
That's right.

1334
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Yeah. And so they've launched a courseware on that, which I think is pretty awesome.

1335
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And they've also recently launched a new social note card system

1336
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
where you can fork note cards and get really good learning stacks.

1337
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
They have scenario-based labs that put you in the middle of everyday comment day tasks.

1338
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
They have instructor mentoring, which is slick,

1339
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
and also a little bit of secret sauce,

1340
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
and the graded server exercises for those of us who just don't test so well.

1341
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
It's nice knowing, like, getting some verification, right?

1342
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
You're just like, yes, I actually did learn that thing.

1343
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
That's me shaking because I was taking a test.

1344
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Yeah, it's really nice.

1345
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
It's a good platform stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members.

1346
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
And if you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you get a great discount.

1347
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I love the fact that they spin up a server on demand that you get to SSH in

1348
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
just as the courseware calls for it.

1349
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
You choose the distro.

1350
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
It modifies the courseware and the machine they spin up, which is nice.

1351
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And the other thing is, and, boy, I could have used this a few years ago,

1352
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
is if you're learning some of the Amazon Web Services stuff,

1353
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
they're managing all of that for you so you don't have surprise bills.

1354
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
You don't have to worry about their complicated setup.

1355
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
You don't have to, like, go get your boss to give you the credit cards.

1356
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
That way they can pay for it.

1357
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
None of that, it's all just built into the Linux Academy courseware.

1358
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Check it out, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1359
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
All right, guys.

1360
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
So we have the official announcement that Flatpaks were released this week.

1361
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
And I thought since it's newsworthy, it came out literally today,

1362
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
it's worth talking about here on the Unplugged show.

1363
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And I don't know where to go with this without just putting it all out there.

1364
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And hopefully people...

1365
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:19,000
So on the Linux Action Show, by the time we got to the Linux Action Show on Sunday,

1366
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
people had really, really, like, drawn a line in the sand

1367
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
and picked a side in the new universal packaging war.

1368
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:37,000
And there was a full-on response, a lot of it from the Red Hat folks,

1369
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
about Canonical's PR strategy.

1370
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And there was some attacks, some of which we covered in the Linux Action Show.

1371
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And it got really kind of ugly fast.

1372
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
A lot of focusing on the PR initiative.

1373
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
A lot of talk about how they use distribution names.

1374
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I think, you know, that is worth thinking about and having a discussion about.

1375
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I think that is a fair discussion.

1376
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
But I was really disappointed to see they didn't go after the technical merits.

1377
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Yeah, that's what I'm most interested in.

1378
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,000
I wanted to take a moment, though, and just point something out

1379
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:20,000
that really rubbed me the wrong way once I came to the realization.

1380
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,000
A lot of the posts on the mailing lists, on the blogs, on Twitter,

1381
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,000
even today, actually, I'm still seeing them even today,

1382
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
about how Canonical is manipulating the PR in this.

1383
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
One of the Fedora mailing lists developers, they said,

1384
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Canonical beat us to the marketing punch.

1385
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:47,000
And then they focused on this aspect so much that I realized what bothered me about it

1386
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
is, Wes, can you do a, do you have a web browser on that?

1387
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I sure do.

1388
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Can you go to opensource.com for me?

1389
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I'll go there with you, too.

1390
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Let's all go there.

1391
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Opensource.com.

1392
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Yeah, let's give them some traffic.

1393
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
How would you describe opensource.com, Wes?

1394
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
I do see a big, friendly Red Hat right in the top right corner.

1395
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.

1396
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
This is, opensource.com is an extremely valuable domain name.

1397
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Now, especially, picture the outsider coming into the Linux ecosystem

1398
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
wanting to learn more about open source.

1399
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
This has got to be one of the biggest pieces of real estate in Linux

1400
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
in the open source ecosystem, opensource.com.

1401
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
This is an outfit that is funded by Red Hat

1402
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
damn near all of the writers write for or are employed by Red Hat.

1403
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
The ones that don't are Red Hat friendly.

1404
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I mean, no disrespect to the people.

1405
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I know some of them that run this, and they're fine people.

1406
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:48,000
But this is literally, this is literally one of several propaganda fronts

1407
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:57,000
that Red Hat finances to gently nudge the news coverage in the Linux ecosystem

1408
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:05,000
on a fucking hourly basis.

1409
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I just, this company is among many tech companies that makes and establishes

1410
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,000
PR outlets, works with journalists, hires Red Hat friendly people to write things.

1411
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
This is something that all of them do.

1412
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
And I understand that the Fedora project is not directly hooked up to Red Hat,

1413
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
but let's be honest, it's a Red Hat project.

1414
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,000
So to come after Canonical for just having a successful PR launch,

1415
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
should they have name dropped distributions?

1416
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Maybe, maybe not.

1417
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I think you could quibble about that.

1418
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Should have Mark Shuttleworth taken a pot shot at Flatpak saying that

1419
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
95% of contributions come from one person?

1420
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,000
No, I don't think so.

1421
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:53,000
But you can't fault them for working with different outlets,

1422
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
for doing interviews, for people behind the scenes working with projects,

1423
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
making sure they understand the SNAP package format,

1424
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,000
troubleshooting problems they run into, directly outreaching to work with them.

1425
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
That's not manipulation.

1426
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:13,000
And see, if you read some of the posts, they all essentially go like this.

1427
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Canonical manipulated the PR.

1428
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
They didn't want to go with somebody else's technology.

1429
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
And the conclusion is, if they really wanted to make this a community effort,

1430
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
they should have come around and talked to us all.

1431
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
They didn't follow the process.

1432
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
They didn't follow the rule.

1433
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
That's the same line of thinking that prevents women from joining different

1434
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
groups and industries or singles out minorities.

1435
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
They didn't follow the process.

1436
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
They didn't go through the proper channels.

1437
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
It is a contribution that happens organically.

1438
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Everybody treats it like it's some master Shuttleworth plan.

1439
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Like Mark Shuttleworth is up in his moon tower up there plotting the global

1440
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,000
dominance of Linux and his master plan is to manipulate the tech press and get

1441
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
them to all orchestrate his brand new package format so that way he can declare

1442
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
dominance and earn all of the millions of dollars by coming up with this technology.

1443
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:11,000
And so when Canonical releases something, instead of going after it on its

1444
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:18,000
technical merits, we go after it on the evil Canonical once again trying to drop

1445
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
something in our laps just like Upstart and Mir.

1446
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:27,000
It's all part of Shuttleworth's master plan.

1447
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
It just gets so old.

1448
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,000
And the constant attacks on the PR are so unfounded.

1449
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
And the Linux Foundation is just as guilty.

1450
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:44,000
They also have donor friendly writers who write puff pieces and don't even

1451
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
disclaim it's being financed by these companies.

1452
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Again, manipulation.

1453
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Go ahead.

1454
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:56,000
The Flatpak thing was interesting because they were saying that Ubuntu was not

1455
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
working with the community and they're trying to build this stuff because the

1456
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
whole not invented here thing except for the fact that Snap was created first and

1457
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
the Flatpak is the actual not invented here.

1458
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Do we really even care which win was created when?

1459
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Because it seems like...

1460
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
No, we don't care.

1461
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
It's just what they're saying.

1462
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
But the more important part is that they're saying these things about how...

1463
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:27,000
When he was saying that 95% of the work, he probably didn't actually tally it up,

1464
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
but the people who were saying it was not 95, it's 75.

1465
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
That's a significant number still.

1466
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
You're caring about a percentage that's not that big of a deal.

1467
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
It's 100% canonical contributors to Snap and SnapD.

1468
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I mean, really.

1469
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
At the end of the day, there's a Red Hat initiative and there's a canonical

1470
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
initiative.

1471
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
To be honest with you...

1472
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
I think his point was it was 100%.

1473
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I think he was saying not necessarily it was 95 Red Hat, it was 95 one person.

1474
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I think what's interesting about the Snap initiative is the work to get it on the

1475
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
other distributions, a lot of that was community driven.

1476
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
People were interested in getting Snap packages on their distribution,

1477
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
so they put the work in.

1478
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Again, it wasn't some sort of canonical master plan.

1479
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Once there was momentum, canonical pushed some of the final bits into piece,

1480
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
made things work, did the outreach.

1481
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
I mean, in their interest, for sure.

1482
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
That absolutely makes sense, but you can honestly see how this was an organic,

1483
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
like, well, let's create something that solves our problem.

1484
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Oh, there's some interest here.

1485
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Well, if there's interest here, we just have to do this, this, this, and then now...

1486
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Okay.

1487
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I mean, you could almost see how it just fell in their lap.

1488
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Like, they're lucky in some sense, and yet it's from their own doing.

1489
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,000
But the reaction is it's part of this master strategy, and that mentality that

1490
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
comes out brings us all to war, and then everybody picks their side.

1491
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
And I intentionally, in the Linux action show, was like, there's a lot of different

1492
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
technologies here.

1493
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I don't know which one's going to work.

1494
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
I think security sucks on all of them right now, and I just think this solution

1495
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
is inevitable at some point.

1496
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
That was my core point in the Linux action show, and I got emails,

1497
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
you have to stop ranting.

1498
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
That was a horrible rant.

1499
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Chris is supporting Snap Pack.

1500
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Chris is a Flatpak yes man.

1501
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Like, that's just stupid crap that I can't even believe.

1502
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Everyone knows you're for app image.

1503
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I mean, come on.

1504
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I just don't care.

1505
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Yeah, right.

1506
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
I mean, we just need a successful technology.

1507
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Hopefully, we can all figure it out without too much of the same thing.

1508
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,000
So with that said, Flatpak, I think, is an interesting solution.

1509
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Yeah, totally.

1510
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,000
I'm a little uncertain that it's going to be the long-term winner for a couple

1511
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
of reasons.

1512
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
It's very desktop focused, and that's a point I meant to mention in the Linux

1513
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:43,000
action show, where snaps are definitely more designed for server, Internet of

1514
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Things devices, and desktops.

1515
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:51,000
And if you think about the huge ass server market, just having all of the

1516
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
momentum that snaps just – okay, how can I say this?

1517
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
You know what I'm trying to say, Wes.

1518
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Because snaps are going to support server installations, there's just going to be

1519
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
more snaps by raw numbers right there.

1520
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
There will be just way more snaps because it supports server stuff and because it

1521
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
works on Ubuntu than app image is probably ever just right there.

1522
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:15,000
And then the fact that – I would think there's going to be so many people

1523
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
familiar with creating snap packages for the server that there's going to be a

1524
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
lot of knowledge sharing that is going to just sort of, I think, be a snowball

1525
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
effect for snaps.

1526
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Well, and that makes a lot of sense, too, with how Popi was talking last week

1527
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
about how it works with how they're mounting that at boot time.

1528
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
So everything will be there.

1529
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:36,000
You can just spin up an Ubuntu droplet, install your snap, and now you're running

1530
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
your binary with all the dependencies handled for you, and it's super easy,

1531
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
right?

1532
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
J6 points out in the chat room that after the Linux action show, the blog I was

1533
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
reading – Adam's blog I was reading.

1534
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I like Adam.

1535
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I think he's a nice guy.

1536
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
The blog I was reading, he updated his post to say, oh, and I guess there's this

1537
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
thing called AppImage.

1538
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
They weren't even aware of AppImage.

1539
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Okay.

1540
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
So maybe there's something to say, like, was enough prior research done?

1541
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Maybe not.

1542
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I don't know.

1543
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I wanted to see – I wanted to give – oh, go ahead.

1544
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Go ahead and start.

1545
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Let's start.

1546
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Let's go in the mobile room.

1547
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,000
So the AppImage thing is funny because AppImage has been around the longest.

1548
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Yeah.

1549
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
And there's, like, project shipping with AppImages right now.

1550
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
One of them by the creator of the kernel we all speak about all the time.

1551
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Yeah.

1552
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
It's just unbelievable.

1553
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,000
But the funny part is, like, this – it's all about the – like, the main core problem

1554
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
is that all this hatred towards Ubuntu, whether it's – like, whether it's even technically

1555
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,000
justified or not, they just want to jump on as many things as possible.

1556
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,000
So, for example, when Snappy was first released in 1604 and it was big, big press, the first

1557
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
thing people said was, well, they just made it for Ubuntu.

1558
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
They don't care about any other distro.

1559
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And then when they show that they're working with the community to actually make it for

1560
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
all other distros as much as possible and as soon as possible, well, that doesn't count

1561
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
anymore.

1562
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Like, that – let's completely ignore the fact that the main complaint we had is now

1563
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
completely voided.

1564
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Let's make – let's find another reason to hate them.

1565
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Yeah.

1566
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I think that's definitely a component.

1567
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I think what makes it sort of murky is there is also a technical argument to be made and

1568
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:11,000
there is also legitimate concerns and questions about the CLA and about their closed backend.

1569
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
All questions, I think, could eventually be answered but don't have good answers right

1570
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
now.

1571
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
And so I wanted to – let's start with – is Ryan and Ike – yeah, good.

1572
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
So let's start with Ike real quick.

1573
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Ike, I saw your G Plus post on this and I thought it made it a good opportunity to say,

1574
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,000
you know, we're talking a lot about this in a way that it makes it sound inevitable

1575
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:37,000
but there's probably some pretty common work cases where this type of packaging isn't

1576
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
really necessary.

1577
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I think you've been getting a lot of questions about snaps in Solace so I'd be really curious

1578
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
to hear your thoughts about it.

1579
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Yeah, I mean, it's been a bit of an outbreak so from my perspective, I've just seen people

1580
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
asking about it because they've heard about this thing called snap.

1581
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
It's suddenly a thing now everybody needs to ask about it.

1582
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,000
People who hadn't ever heard about it before, this is now the future of everything.

1583
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Why aren't you using it, you human scum?

1584
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:07,000
And this has pretty much been the weight of the tide so far.

1585
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Boom.

1586
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,000
From zero to 60.

1587
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Yeah, I mean, far be it from me to be outspoken at all.

1588
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,000
But I mean, people started straight up with Solace.

1589
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
It's like, you really, really, really now need to be using snaps.

1590
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,000
And it's like, well, I mean, I'm probably going to go into a bit of a rant now myself,

1591
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
so may I?

1592
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Yeah, go ahead.

1593
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Right, so Solace has been around in one form or another now for the last few years.

1594
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
It's got a bit of an old code base and it's got this commotion in the old bugger behind

1595
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
it for the last few years as well.

1596
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Now, Solace was designed, as I said earlier, to avoid these design issues, right?

1597
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Solace doesn't have 14 different versions of a library.

1598
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
We'll have one.

1599
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
You're only using that.

1600
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,000
So immediately, we don't have the problem of what if I need this version of a library?

1601
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Well, you're not getting it.

1602
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
It's as simple as that.

1603
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Well, how are we going to get LibreOffice?

1604
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
We already packaged LibreOffice for you.

1605
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Why do you suddenly need LibreOffice packaged?

1606
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:09,000
And then there's the fact that Solace doesn't use a traditional packaging format.

1607
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
So if you look at any traditional format, say a Debian package.

1608
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Now, Debian packaging is hard, right?

1609
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:20,000
It's one of the reasons I first went with an independent base because I passionately,

1610
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
passionately hate Debian packaging.

1611
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
That if it was on fire, I wouldn't piss on it, right?

1612
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I hate it that much.

1613
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,000
So I went as far away in the opposite direction.

1614
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Now, when you package something, you have a policy.

1615
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
You say, these are development files.

1616
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
These are files the user is going to need.

1617
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
This thing has relational dependencies between them.

1618
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
So I designed a packaged build system that would tie all those pieces together

1619
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
and put the policy in place.

1620
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
So I don't have to do manual file lists.

1621
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I don't have to do manual things at all, right?

1622
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,000
So to give an example, Michael Hall posted up an example of how easy it was to package

1623
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,000
the Genie Editor for Ubuntu and Apple Snaps.

1624
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
You saw that post, right?

1625
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I think it was about 32 lines.

1626
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Yeah, he said he was editing the YAML file for the GenieSnap from within Genie.

1627
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Right.

1628
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
The Solus package is smaller.

1629
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
The build file is smaller.

1630
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,000
So from the perspective of Solus, just from a packaging perspective mind,

1631
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I'm not talking about confinement or sandboxing.

1632
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Snap is technologically inferior to what we already have, okay?

1633
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:36,000
So that's one huge reason for Solus not to need to adopt it.

1634
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
We go for integration.

1635
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
So say Solus is using GTK 3.18 now.

1636
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
We have the 3.18 theme.

1637
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
We want everything to look good, yeah?

1638
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:52,000
So why would it then want to bring in 3.20 packages that then don't quite interact properly

1639
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
or don't look quite well?

1640
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Solus has an optimized runtime.

1641
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Would it then want to use a runtime that isn't optimized or is built or maintained by somebody else?

1642
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:08,000
So it sounds like you're worried about it taking away my curation is kind of what you're saying.

1643
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I mean, curation is definitely one part of it, but I don't want to water down my system

1644
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
and trust somebody else to build my operating system because if they were capable of doing that,

1645
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I wouldn't be the person building Solus.

1646
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
You are in a unique position there, that's funny.

1647
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:27,000
So now I want to ask Ryan, who's sort of on the other end of this, who's got an upstream project

1648
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:31,000
that's moving extremely fast, there's lots of features they want to ship, they want a guarantee.

1649
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Clearly he's involved with packaging and the difficulties there.

1650
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And he wants to get out on as many freaking distros as freaking possible.

1651
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:43,000
So Ryan, what are your thoughts about snaps and flat packs and all of that and some of your experience so far?

1652
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Oh boy.

1653
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
You know that Ike and I used to work on Solus together.

1654
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I used to try to help out.

1655
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:08,000
So the problem is when I'm packaging my crop, I have to pack it for every single thing.

1656
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It's not enormously – well, no, it is.

1657
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It's kind of an enormous task.

1658
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Yeah, that's what I hear a lot.

1659
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:22,000
And you've got to do a lot of talking with folks who are involved in the distro.

1660
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And it's just – it's kind of a mess.

1661
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Even Debian packaging is a mess.

1662
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Well, I guess Ike kind of said that.

1663
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
You're trying to be diplomatic about it.

1664
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Just go and say it's awful.

1665
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I think everyone knows that.

1666
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Yeah, and so the thing is it doesn't have to be snappy.

1667
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
It doesn't have to be flat pack.

1668
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:50,000
It doesn't have to be AppImage, but whatever – or maybe it's all three of them.

1669
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Well, actually, can I make you – I disagree.

1670
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I think you're being too polite because Mycroft, I mean legitimately, has some server-side components that AppImage simply just doesn't address.

1671
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Yeah, and I've thought about that, especially when you're running headless or you're running with the device.

1672
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
But the thing is is all we want to do is be able to give people the newest version of the application.

1673
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,000
That's it.

1674
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
And we just – and we don't want to spend all of our time packaging.

1675
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I've had a guy who's – Aaron, who's been working two weeks on just packaging.

1676
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And that's kind of ridiculous.

1677
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Like we just want to get a version that somebody can pull down and install and not have to worry about it.

1678
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:39,000
If that's snappy – I've got SnapD on my Arch machine since we were talking about it. I installed it, but I haven't restarted yet.

1679
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
So the SnapD isn't running.

1680
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
It's not on your path yet.

1681
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:54,000
But I was going to – but like the – but the idea is as an application developer, I just want to be able to tell people like here, this is an easy way to install it.

1682
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
If you want to pull it from your distro, that's great.

1683
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
But like this is a fast way to do it.

1684
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
And we know everything's good in there.

1685
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
We know the system libraries.

1686
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
You don't have to worry about them.

1687
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:15,000
The thing that really actually made me look at Flatpak and look at SnapD is I updated FreeType 2.

1688
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I think I talked about this last time I was on here.

1689
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,000
And FreeType 2 broke all my Electron apps when it went to 2.6.3, I think.

1690
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
And I was like, I can't believe that happened.

1691
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I can't believe that such a – just this font library broke my Electron apps.

1692
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:42,000
And you can say whatever you want about Electron or about anything along that path.

1693
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:51,000
But it would have been great from a user perspective when I'm just trying to use Slack to tell somebody something if it was just all self-contained.

1694
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
And I don't know what the security implications of that are.

1695
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:02,000
But it's frustrating, especially when you're trying to get stuff done.

1696
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Yeah.

1697
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:11,000
So I guess I think, Ryan, the reason why I like your perspective is because I think it represents two valid points of view.

1698
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
So I want to toss it back over to Aiki.

1699
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:21,000
So Aiki, I think really what I see here is Ryan makes a case for certain specific applications to be distributed this way.

1700
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:28,000
And I think you're making the case that the base system and all your daily driver applications should probably be maintained by the distro.

1701
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
What do you think?

1702
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Yeah, I mean, you do need a domain separation, right?

1703
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
So I have what I call the operating system.

1704
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:47,000
And in the case of Solus, that is basically up to the budget desktop and any – the fat stuff and the stuff that we own, like the web browser, text editor, things like that.

1705
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Apps on top of that are then separate.

1706
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:56,000
In the case of applications, so from Solus' perspective, we're not owned by a corporation.

1707
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:59,000
It's just me, Paddy, here you have to deal with, right?

1708
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
So I can be a bit more flexible than most.

1709
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:09,000
If I was a company or something, it'd be harder to deal with Solus, but it's just me because, you know, I'm not here to make a fugue without Solus, so it's simpler for me.

1710
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:15,000
So I'm happy to, if you like, bend a few rules to help the application developers get in.

1711
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:22,000
But then from the other perspective, I mean, I can make it as easy in the world for any of these guys to package their app up for Solus.

1712
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I'll even make sure their patch is getting for libraries, or I'll even make sure they have the different versions of the libraries they need.

1713
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I'm happy to do that.

1714
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,000
From my perspective, and sorry, Ryan, but you kind of made yourself a target there.

1715
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Now, to use MyCraft as an example, now, that's something that I look at as having a system level of components.

1716
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Now, as for being up in a flat pack, well, I've already gone and looked at the code.

1717
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Now, Ryan himself will tell you, I've already requested an architectural analysis of that.

1718
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I've gone and looked through Mimic because I'm not happy with the code, right?

1719
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
And I've worked with them.

1720
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
They've had a few issues there and I've spoken with them, and they are responsive.

1721
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
I'm good in that.

1722
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:07,000
But things like that, I wouldn't want to go in first because I don't want Solus users in the dark, right?

1723
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Because then you're getting into an area, now, not to use, specifically not to use Mimic or MyCraft in this example,

1724
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:22,000
but what you then get is a downward spiral that contributes to incompetency of software engineering practices.

1725
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:30,000
So, by allowing everybody to run in a container, by allowing everyone to be isolated, they can get away with having shite code.

1726
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
But don't they already?

1727
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Yeah, but I'm not one of those people.

1728
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I'm the sort of person who runs their code through Valgrind and static analysis and makes sure it doesn't leak.

1729
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:46,000
So, by allowing these things to just break, like, do whatever they want because they're in a sandbox,

1730
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
we're just going to have this downward spiral of incompetency.

1731
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:55,000
It would be like saying if you put your car and limited it to 10 miles an hour and put cushions all around the side of it.

1732
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I think you're caught in a logic loop here because I think we are already in that paradigm of software quality

1733
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:10,000
and that's why projects like yours exist in the first place because we're sick and tired of it

1734
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,000
and we need people who care about some of those small things.

1735
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Sure, but I mean, there does need to be, it's a case of owners, isn't it?

1736
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:24,000
We all need to agree, first of all, we do need the OS app separation, right?

1737
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,000
So, the OS, everything up to and including the desktop that you ship, that belongs to you.

1738
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,000
If your version of a library breaks the applications, you're a bad vendor, right?

1739
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:39,000
If the applications break the operating system, that's a bad application.

1740
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
So, I can see why you need the separation.

1741
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:45,000
What about the use case that some of these things solve?

1742
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Not necessarily a flat pack, but definitely app image and snaps.

1743
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
What about this really important use case where you just have no control over this?

1744
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Somebody discovers Solace, they download it, they've just recently switched over from a Mac or Windows

1745
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,000
and the way they install software is they go to the vendor's website and they download it from their website.

1746
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,000
They're dumb, they don't know any better, curse them, but that's how they want to do it.

1747
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:14,000
That is a one example, but legitimately, let's be honest, it really is solving a problem.

1748
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Did you be able to say, there are better ways to get software on Linux, but if you want to download this snap,

1749
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,000
just go here, download these snaps or that use case, here's a thumb drive full of snaps, install these.

1750
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:30,000
There are scenarios where it is beneficial to the entire platform as a whole to be able to say,

1751
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
this could be installed on Linux.

1752
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
End of sentence.

1753
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I mean, it can be beneficial, but I mean, there's so many problems with this as well.

1754
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:48,000
So, when I install a.exe, I mean, I'm sorry, when I install a snap from the internet,

1755
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
because this is exactly what we're emulating.

1756
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Between Flatpak and Snap, we're just trying to emulate Android, right?

1757
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Yeah, I guess so.

1758
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
This is exactly what we're trying to do here.

1759
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
We're downloading arbitrary files from the internet and install it, but this time,

1760
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
we're going to do it without the store itself, which is what snaps are trying to do.

1761
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Except there's a store and there's a repo with snaps, so no.

1762
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Yeah, except for the store, none of our distributions can actually contribute code to this unless we,

1763
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
the store itself, we can't see, right?

1764
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
That's completely proprietary.

1765
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:22,000
We're not allowed to see it, but we're going to trust code going through though, yeah?

1766
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:28,000
There's a difference between saying you don't trust it and saying it doesn't exist.

1767
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Along with that, if I want to contribute code to get any of Snap fixed or better integrated,

1768
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I then have to sign a contributor license agreement.

1769
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
I agree.

1770
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
So, how open is it really?

1771
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
It's open in terms of code.

1772
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:45,000
The code is open, but if I want to contribute it and I want to integrate into Solus, then I can't.

1773
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I think you could throw snaps out there and the entire conversation is still valid

1774
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
if you're just talking flat pack and app image.

1775
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I agree that I think none of them are technically close yet.

1776
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I mean, close might not be the thing, but...

1777
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I mean, they have kind of definitely a while to go.

1778
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
And this is the thing.

1779
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,000
We're getting into heated arguments nowadays like, well, everybody is,

1780
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
but neither of them have had a chance to prove themselves yet.

1781
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
It's early days.

1782
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I think it is early, and I think what I think I really appreciate about your viewpoint is

1783
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:20,000
it represents sort of the person who's willing to go that extra step,

1784
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
to think a little bit harder about the way these things are built,

1785
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
to present the user with better options, to make sure that things are built and designed properly

1786
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:33,000
and things are running current, and those are going to be the people that are the most disserviced,

1787
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I think, by the more generic software installation gets on Linux.

1788
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:42,000
And so I think the point that you're representing here in this conversation is a huge point of input

1789
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
that we're getting, it's not exactly refined like that yet,

1790
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,000
but we're getting a lot of that feedback into the show, is there is a point for the package maintainer.

1791
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,000
There is a point for the builder, for the assembler, and we have come to these positions

1792
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,000
and had people do these jobs for very specific reasons.

1793
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,000
It wasn't just arbitrary that we just one day all decided we're going to have package maintainers

1794
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
and we're going to have repos and we're going to do software this way,

1795
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
and we're going to share libraries.

1796
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
That wasn't just an accident.

1797
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,000
There was good reason for it, and when you implement it properly,

1798
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,000
it is a very good system, and it's not going away necessarily.

1799
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
And then I think Ryan does a great job of representing the upstream project

1800
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
that's got something really neat on their hands that they want to get out to as many people possible

1801
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:28,000
in the most predictable manner possible, in the most user-acceptable manner possible.

1802
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
And that's also a completely legitimate point of view.

1803
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I have a question for Ryan.

1804
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Go ahead, Ryan.

1805
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Ryan, if you have a situation where the packaging, the current structure of packaging,

1806
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:47,000
let's say the application level and not the core base was just those three competing.

1807
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,000
All of the three, the Flatpak, the SNAPS, and the AppImage,

1808
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
are all equally dominant at some point in time.

1809
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Would that be an improvement to the current state?

1810
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
If they were all competing but all still...

1811
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Say that one more time, I'm sorry.

1812
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:09,000
If you had to make three packages, and depending on the distro,

1813
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,000
let's say some distros use SNAPS, some use Flatpak,

1814
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
but they don't all have a universal, they don't all agree to that.

1815
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
But instead of having to deal with the maintainers,

1816
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
instead of having to deal with different formats based on the different distros

1817
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
and the different distro versions, you only had to make three,

1818
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,000
one for each structure for Flatpak, SNAPS, etc.

1819
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Would that be an improvement to the current state for Mycroft?

1820
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Sure. I mean, what we're talking about is kind of totally different, I think.

1821
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Ike is talking about some of these lower-level system libraries

1822
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
that, frankly, Mycroft does use.

1823
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
We walk kind of a line.

1824
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
We've had issues packaging with SNAPI in the past

1825
01:36:53,000 --> 01:37:01,000
because we touch some things that are not as simple as your normal desktop application.

1826
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:05,000
But the thing that we're trying to do,

1827
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:08,000
and I think what a lot of application vendors are trying to do,

1828
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:15,000
is put something out there where they're not so worried about

1829
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:20,000
system library changing like free type 2 when they haven't written support for that yet.

1830
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:26,000
There are a lot of things like that where you're trying to do your best

1831
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:33,000
as an application developer, but you got so many competing desires from your users

1832
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
that sometimes you need to have that direct relationship with them

1833
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
in order to provide a good, consistent, stable experience.

1834
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:50,000
And I think that if we demonize these projects,

1835
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
and I know that's not what a lot of people are doing,

1836
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:00,000
but there's obviously a reason that they're gaining traction,

1837
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,000
and that's because application developers are having a hard time targeting Linux

1838
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
and getting a consistent experience to their users.

1839
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
And to talk about the trust issue,

1840
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:20,000
if somebody is willing to go and grab a PPA for a piece of software,

1841
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,000
they already trust who's providing that PPA.

1842
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Should they trust them? I don't know.

1843
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:29,000
But they already do, and there's a lot of trust that's thrown around anyway.

1844
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
You know, you're trusting the maintainers.

1845
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Sorry, there's people confusing PPAs with being canonically maintained.

1846
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Yeah, I think you make a good point, Ryan.

1847
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
And I want to give you sort of the final input here.

1848
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,000
You said you have a proposition.

1849
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:50,000
I'll start off with one bit of confusion I actually had with Ryan there,

1850
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
which I didn't understand.

1851
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Ryan, you just asked if they were all competing standards,

1852
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
would you then accept them all and it would all be a good thing.

1853
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
That doesn't seem like it makes sense to me.

1854
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
You would adopt one of these standards because of the universal standard

1855
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
to solve the problem of not doing the other packaging formats.

1856
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Otherwise, you'd essentially just took on three more packaging formats.

1857
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
No, I didn't. No.

1858
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I never said we would just package one.

1859
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:21,000
I never said we would just package one of those.

1860
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
That's not what I just said either.

1861
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Hold on, stop, stop.

1862
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
This is not really worth talking about.

1863
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
It's just simple.

1864
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,000
The question was if you could basically get away with using just AppImage,

1865
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Flatpak, and Snaps.

1866
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
You've essentially covered the entire ecosystem.

1867
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Isn't that better than creating four different versions of the RPM,

1868
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
two devs, one for Debian, one for Ubuntu,

1869
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
and submitting it to the openSUSE build service

1870
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
and trying to get it in copper.

1871
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
That's what I was saying.

1872
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Yeah, that's all you're saying.

1873
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
It's not better.

1874
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
I think seriously that the problem is elsewhere.

1875
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Seriously, the problem is that developers have been doing development

1876
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
relying on system-wide things like package names.

1877
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Developers used version control systems appropriately.

1878
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,000
By appropriately, I mean include your dependencies in your project tree

1879
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
as a submodule of GitHub or SVN or whatever.

1880
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
This would allow any maintainer to go and compile the project.

1881
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Now, how they distribute those files in their distribution is their problem.

1882
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
But everyone, there is a maintainer, will be able to just get your source

1883
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
and build it.

1884
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
That would actually fix things.

1885
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
We wouldn't care if we're deploying 30 different packages

1886
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
because at the end of the day, anyone really wanting,

1887
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
they could download the source and build.

1888
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I don't want to wait for a maintainer to do that.

1889
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I think just the complication of that landscape.

1890
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Here's what I get on the Coda Radio show.

1891
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
A lot of people who want to start distributing Linux server-side apps

1892
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,000
and they want to ask Mike and I the best way to go about it.

1893
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
The number one thing they have a problem with is,

1894
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I can't effing figure out how to even get my app out there.

1895
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
How do I package it?

1896
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Which one should I be packaging it for?

1897
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Which version of those districts should I package it for?

1898
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Then once I've packaged it, how the hell do I let anybody know about it?

1899
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
There's no app store.

1900
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,000
There's no central news place that people check.

1901
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
How the hell do I let anybody know I've created this thing?

1902
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:18,000
The entire process is so opaque to them.

1903
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
It's so nebulous to them that they honestly say,

1904
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
you know what, I got better things to do.

1905
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I'll just go make a Docker container and call it good.

1906
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
I'm out.

1907
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Okay, so we should probably wrap it up.

1908
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
But I guess the point is,

1909
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
is what I think people are fundamentally missing

1910
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
when they're not getting the entire argument is,

1911
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,000
and maybe I'll send it back to Ikey so we can finish this thought here,

1912
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:44,000
but the point is, there's a problem out there,

1913
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
a meta-problem that goes beyond the technology,

1914
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,000
that goes beyond the sandboxing, that goes beyond who created it.

1915
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
The meta-problem is, is there is a wave of talent

1916
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
that wants to create software for a platform,

1917
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
and they simply can't even figure out how to get the applications here.

1918
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
And if you don't think it's true,

1919
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
you haven't been talking to a lot of developers,

1920
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
because it is fundamentally just that stupid basic problem

1921
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
is what's holding up a ton of them.

1922
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
As I looked at it, it looked super complicated.

1923
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I ain't got time for that.

1924
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
And when you have so many choices, how do you know which one?

1925
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
And they're not familiar with it.

1926
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Or a really fancy app for the Mac OS X,

1927
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
because they're defined.

1928
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Or you end up with your own cloud on Debian.

1929
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1930
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
But okay, I know that wasn't your main point

1931
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
about the semantics of the packages.

1932
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
You had another point you wanted to make in there, right?

1933
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Yeah, no, I mean, that one I was just literally confused about.

1934
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Yeah, so finish it up there.

1935
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Didn't know that was going to happen.

1936
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So my proposal is basically this.

1937
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I know it probably is not actually on here at the moment,

1938
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
so I'll let him reply on IRC.

1939
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
So this one's a bit of a freeway.

1940
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,000
But, well, moving on.

1941
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
So my proposal is basically this.

1942
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I know I've raised concerns over parts of the code base in Mimic.

1943
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Now, to be clear, this is not me trying to crap on Mimic, right?

1944
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:07,000
This is because of the forked code base that it started from.

1945
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Now that stuff is already a nightmare to work with.

1946
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I can see that.

1947
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
So I'm not crapping on those guys' stuff.

1948
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
So my proposal goes freeway.

1949
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Ryan, it feels like this is your life.

1950
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I will package all of my craft for Solus, right?

1951
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,000
And I will demonstrate how easy this is going to be.

1952
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
That's a great title.

1953
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
I will demonstrate how easy this is going to be.

1954
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Now, it's something I'm going to be maintaining, right?

1955
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
And just as long, I want you to take the patches coming back.

1956
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
So this is, you know, to get everyone back in the mood

1957
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
and open source and contribute, right?

1958
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
I will give you the patches back from Solus

1959
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
for the things that I have concerns about,

1960
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
as opposed to just sitting there bitching about them.

1961
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Now, because there's a lot of that that goes on these days.

1962
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:00,000
And for Popey, there are some things I think

1963
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
that Y package in Solus has already done, right?

1964
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Now, as much as I picked on it before for having some technical limitations

1965
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
in comparison to Solus' Y package,

1966
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
that doesn't mean that Snappy isn't good for Ubuntu.

1967
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
What doesn't work for us will actually work for Ubuntu, right?

1968
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
This is their solution. That's great.

1969
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
There are some things we have already done in Y package in Solus

1970
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:29,000
that I keep going to say, flat back, I'm sorry, but it's not.

1971
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
There are some things that it could really, really benefit from.

1972
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
So some of the things that we took from Clear Linux,

1973
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
it could also benefit from them, like the optimizations,

1974
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
the advanced pattern and logic.

1975
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,000
So some of those concepts, some of the constructs that we use

1976
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,000
in our YAML files, I think they could really do those.

1977
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Now, personally, I'm not going to be able to sign the CLA.

1978
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
So what I'll do, I will put those contributions out as public domain,

1979
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:55,000
and I will leave those for anyone in the canonical to take them up

1980
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
and merge them if they wish.

1981
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Nice. And you know what? If Mycroft in some way,

1982
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
like a Venom extension or some capacity,

1983
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
ended up integrated into the desktop on Solus...

1984
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Oh, boy, that wouldn't be a bad thing.

1985
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Well, we have Raven, don't we?

1986
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
I would have to run that on my laptop.

1987
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
I would think I'd get that on my laptop.

1988
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
We have the Raven sidebar. How sexy would that be?

1989
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Yeah. That's my promise.

1990
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,000
I would like to point out, too, that I love Solus.

1991
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I used to be a part of that community, and I've used Y package,

1992
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:29,000
and it's a good solution.

1993
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:36,000
So Ike and I, we get along in other settings.

1994
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
It's Wes. He brings out the worst in people.

1995
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
I sure do.

1996
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Yeah. But what we're just trying to do is find easy ways

1997
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
to get our software to users.

1998
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I mean, this has got to be, wherever we end up,

1999
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
this is going to be kind of a good thing for projects like yours, Ryan.

2000
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
So I'm excited for it, and I can't imagine you aren't.

2001
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Can you share it all?

2002
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Have people from Canonical contacted the project and said,

2003
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
can we get you started? Can we help?

2004
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
What's that process been like?

2005
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
Because that seems to be sort of a key piece that they've done

2006
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
that's helped them get an early start on a lot of snaps,

2007
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,000
is Canonical is working directly with different projects

2008
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
to help them say, hey, do you have any questions?

2009
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Are you interested? Can we help you?

2010
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Have you had any discussions like that?

2011
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
So first I'd like to real quick thank Ike,

2012
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
and I can't think of who else popped in,

2013
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:35,000
but some early folks popped in from Solace and from Ubuntu

2014
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:42,000
and a guy from Fedora to provide some kind of day one and day two feedback

2015
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:46,000
on the repo when it first went open source, the MyCraftCore repo.

2016
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
So first I want to thank those guys.

2017
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,000
But yeah, we have had the Ubuntu guys reach out to us

2018
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
and walk us through packaging.

2019
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:01,000
We have some requirements as far as access to the sound devices

2020
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:06,000
that we still do a back and forth with them on.

2021
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I'm making sure that it picks the right sound device.

2022
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Yeah, it needs to pick the right sound device.

2023
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
It needs to pick the sound device that's in use by the user.

2024
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
It needs to have a good default.

2025
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:24,000
There's a lot of nuance in picking and managing sound devices.

2026
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:29,000
But all around they've been really good providing feedback.

2027
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:35,000
I talked to Adam Miller on the Fedora project

2028
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,000
who also provided some feedback around Flatpak.

2029
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:46,000
But yes, so far everybody who I've spoken to on the Snappy team

2030
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
has been really great about answering questions,

2031
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
so same with the Flatpak guys.

2032
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
And then of course there have been Wimpy

2033
01:47:54,000 --> 01:48:00,000
who helped us out with packaging for Debian for Ubuntu.

2034
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:06,000
So I don't want to poop on any of the packaging things.

2035
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,000
And I want to say that the Snappy guys and the Flatpak guys

2036
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,000
have been great providing feedback.

2037
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:22,000
My two cents is that I'd really like to start discussing

2038
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:25,000
the technical merits of these projects,

2039
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
like you've been advocating for, Chris.

2040
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I'd love to see more write-ups on what the actual difference is

2041
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
and not about canonical quote-unquote propaganda.

2042
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Boy, that is so great.

2043
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I think that's probably our ending note right there

2044
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
is I think just maybe future episodes,

2045
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
maybe we'll just start the conversation,

2046
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
future episodes I'd like to talk about.

2047
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,000
First of all, Flatpaks are very much a repo-based technology

2048
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,000
which is a totally different approach than say AppImage

2049
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
or Snap necessarily can be a totally different approach

2050
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,000
and is in some ways reminiscent of PPAs, good and bad,

2051
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
and means software updates will be easier.

2052
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
There's a lot of technology there, right?

2053
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Their sandboxing is further along for different distributions.

2054
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Snaps, I think it's only on Ubuntu and Arch right now,

2055
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,000
but how are they doing that?

2056
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
What is AppArmor the right choice?

2057
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
All these questions that we have,

2058
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,000
questions about re-implementing the Snap store backend

2059
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
or creating your own Snap store.

2060
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Do you have to rebuild the Snap D program?

2061
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
And where will the real community actually flourish?

2062
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Yeah, is uApp browser, whatever it is, uBrowser, whatever it is,

2063
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
is that going to be the place?

2064
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
All these little questions that we have I think now

2065
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
are what we should start talking about

2066
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
and the technical aspects of them.

2067
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
I think this part of it, it really has moved

2068
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
to a very partisan discussion very quickly,

2069
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:53,000
but I don't know if there's much more productive conversation

2070
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
to be had there.

2071
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I will say I think we may end up with two regardless.

2072
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I think that something you said caught my attention,

2073
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,000
just that really Snaps are the only one

2074
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
with any server focus at all.

2075
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Like Flatpak explicitly says that it doesn't really fit with the server

2076
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
and AppImage has that great desktop in there.

2077
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
So I think really Docker or something like that

2078
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
is here to stay on the server side too.

2079
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
So there's probably at least going to be two.

2080
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,000
The momentum and demand around delivering reliable,

2081
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
consistent, predictable software on the server

2082
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:26,000
is going to make Snaps at least successful

2083
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
on the Ubuntu platform.

2084
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I think probably that alone.

2085
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
But all of that is a conversation for another day.

2086
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Join us on Sunday on the Linux Action Show.

2087
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
We'll be reviewing the new Fedora release.

2088
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I'm really looking forward to it.

2089
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
This is the release I have been hoping for.

2090
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Gnome 320 is looking nice.

2091
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
It's got Flatpak support.

2092
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:46,000
I've had a Fedora installation on the server running for a while now

2093
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
that I'm going to be upgrading to Fedora 24

2094
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
and reporting on that.

2095
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Really have been looking forward to it.

2096
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Join us live Tuesday.

2097
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,000
That's my next Tuesday, my last episode before I go on vacay.

2098
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Wes, you may not be here too.

2099
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,000
I may not be here.

2100
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
So we may have a special guest sitting in Wes's chair.

2101
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Find out the time in your local time

2102
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
by going to jupyterbroadcasting.com.

2103
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Then join us at jblive.tv, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

2104
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

2105
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I've never installed Gnome slash Linux.

2106
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Zombies don't run Linux.

2107
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I've never installed Gnome slash Linux.

2108
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I got the sense right as we were leaving there,

2109
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
the rotten, you had something you wanted to add,

2110
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
but we were wrapping up.

2111
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Did you have, did you want to complete a thought?

2112
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,000
I was just going to answer your question about the UAP Explorer.

2113
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2114
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
That's the unofficial, non-canonical thing.

2115
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Right, yeah.

2116
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Remember how the Ubuntu forms were unofficial at one time?

2117
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Remember that?

2118
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
And they became, that's a long time ago.

2119
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,000
That's a while ago.

2120
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,000
jbtitles.com.

2121
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Well, the UAP Explorer is not just snappy.

2122
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
It also has click packages, so it's kind of like a mess right now.

2123
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Yeah, for now.

2124
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Hey, both, a big thank you to both Ryan and Ike,

2125
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
who had stepped in the ring.

2126
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Thank you also, of course, to everybody who contributed.

2127
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
But it was, there was a lot of heavy lifting there by you guys.

2128
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Really appreciate it.

2129
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Yeah, I don't think I needed to mention it,

2130
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
but it was very nice having different perspectives

2131
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,000
from the different audiences.

2132
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Yeah, yeah.

2133
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Absolutely.

2134
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Yeah.

2135
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Maintainers, packagers, all that.

2136
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I wanted to add that Mycroft is already dockerized.

2137
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Right, so there you go.

2138
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,000
There you go.

2139
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Of course it is.

2140
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Right?

2141
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
Everything's dockerized.

2142
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,000
All right.

2143
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
drivertitles.com, you guys.

2144
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Got to go to drivertitles.com.

2145
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
My little poppy.

2146
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Oh boy.

2147
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
That poppy sounded like a robot, huh?

2148
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I got to get...

2149
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Sorry about the My Little Poppy one.

2150
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I got to get Mycroft installed on this machine

2151
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
just so I can make poppy say stuff during the show

2152
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
when he's not here.

2153
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Right?

2154
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,000
You have to.

2155
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
That's obvious.

2156
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Poppies are going to end up showing up on a lot of podcasts.

2157
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I want...

2158
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:20,000
So I want the functionality to say Mycroft define coconut.

2159
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Like I want to be able to just...

2160
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Can I do that, Ryan?

2161
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Will I be able to get like a word definition?

2162
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Because that's what I would like to have right here

2163
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
in the studio with a mic on it.

2164
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
And that way when I want to define something,

2165
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:37,000
I can just ask Mycroft and then poppy reads the answer.

2166
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Let me check.

2167
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Let me pop them up right now.

2168
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
I love it.

2169
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
So Eki, you spent a lot of effort trying to make sure

2170
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
that games work on it, especially Steam games,

2171
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
but are you getting any support from Valve

2172
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:58,000
and doesn't it kind of suck if you're not?

2173
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Well, I mean, you must have realized by now,

2174
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,000
I'm, you know, I'm half wired wrong.

2175
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,000
So in terms of support from Valve,

2176
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
the way I kind of look at it defined is like,

2177
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:14,000
well, I'm doing it because they're not.

2178
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,000
You know, I mean, eventually they're going to pick up

2179
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
on what I'm doing and eventually all this stuff

2180
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
will become the norm and everything will be fixed.

2181
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
But it doesn't really bug me, to be honest with you.

2182
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Do I think they should have been doing it properly first?

2183
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Yes.

2184
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Do I think they should have used Ubuntu 12.04

2185
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
and use a runtime library like that? No.

2186
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,000
But it's the same reason why I think Flatpak is doomed as well

2187
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
because of the whole thing.

2188
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
We're going to provide your API, um, ABI,

2189
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
but we're not going to define it.

2190
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
So what it should have been is like, this is the ABI we need,

2191
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,000
not this is the ABI you're going to use in this exact form.

2192
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
And that's exactly the same problem Flatpak has.

2193
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
And it's the reason why Flatpak would never go into Solus,

2194
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,000
why Snap would never be a primary form.

2195
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,000
It could be something we could accept as a secondary form in Solus, you know?

2196
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Because it doesn't push that, um,

2197
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
it doesn't force that distribution method on you.

2198
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,000
That's perfect because Snap is not, it's intended to be a supplement.

2199
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
It's not intended to replace the core at all.

2200
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Like, Far Shutterworth was asked about whether Snap would make it

2201
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
where that Debian was not necessary.

2202
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
And he said that was never going to happen,

2203
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000
that Debian is a fundamental importance to Ubuntu.

2204
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Yeah, there's no reason for them to pursue that.

2205
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Hold on, hold on, guys.

2206
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
This is CNN Breaking News.

2207
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
We have an update from Robot Popey.

2208
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Greetings, Professor Falken.

2209
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Would you like to see some projected kill ratios?

2210
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Oh, God.

2211
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
That's awesome.

2212
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:47,000
And that is our, oh, God, that is our Popey robot update.

2213
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Where did that come from?

2214
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Popey.

2215
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
The Whopper, I believe.

2216
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Popey's inside the Whopper now.

2217
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
That's amazing.

2218
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
So, yeah, I got to get hooked up to the stream.

2219
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Yep.

2220
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Oh, Popey.

2221
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,000
That is maybe the next most important JB project.

2222
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Oh, Popey.

2223
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
You know, JBot needs a voice.

2224
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Yes, it does.

2225
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
JBot needs a voice.

2226
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
It needs to come alive.

2227
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Wouldn't it be great if at the end of the show we could turn on JBot?

2228
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:15,000
And, like, wouldn't it be, I wonder if there's a way we could,

2229
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
you wouldn't want people to, like, jam it up.

2230
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,000
No.

2231
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
But you'd want to have certain people, I don't know,

2232
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
because you wouldn't want to limit it either,

2233
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
but it would be great if we could give JBot a voice

2234
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
at this point in time during the show.

2235
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Can we ask Ryan right now that if you asked Mycroft,

2236
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,000
would you like to play a game?

2237
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
That's the answer.

2238
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,000
How about a game of chess?

2239
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,000
That was pretty good.

2240
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:38,000
That was good.

2241
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Greetings, Professor Falcon.

2242
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Would you like to see some projected kill ratios?

2243
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
You know what I got to do is I got to put that on the soundboard

2244
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
is what I got to do, because that's going to be handy.

2245
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
I secretly use Arch Linux.

2246
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
All right, so we got to go pick our title

2247
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:55,000
and then we got to get out of here.

2248
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Yep.

2249
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
It's getting ridiculous.

2250
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Oh, yeah, sure.
