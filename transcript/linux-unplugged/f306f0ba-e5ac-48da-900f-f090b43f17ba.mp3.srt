1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,460
I feel like we should probably warn everybody that next week is the daylight savings monster in the US and it's gonna mess with everybody's

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:12,880
Lifetime it's already happening. That's one of the reasons why we don't have any folks here today is it's already happened across the pond

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,800
They're all screwed up

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,880
Yes, yes, we are. I still blame George W Bush for this

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,220
It was really Bush's fault and now it's all it's totally ever since he did that

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,420
It's screwed with my live shows around this time of year. So next Sunday the 5th at 2 a.m. In the US

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,760
We switch so now it's gonna mess with land, but since land isn't live no big deal. Yeah

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:37,240
Yeah, see if we just had that one Linux based world government. Yeah, right. It could all just be Unix time

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,400
Would that be the Linux Foundation? Yeah, I guess so

10
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:47,560
You know change from a sort of foundation to government agency, but let's let's let's put a pin in that idea Wes

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,240
This is Linux unplugged episode

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,080
221 for October 31st. Whoo 2017

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,260
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's still in a reinstall fugue state. My name is Chris

14
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,700
My name is Wes. Hello beard. Mmm burgers. Yeah

15
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,820
We all have a little we have some burger pleasantry going on right now, but that's not what we're here to talk about

16
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,520
I'm not here talking about burgers at least at least not yet

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,700
No, we have a really great show lined up for you today. Very excited about today's program for a couple of reasons

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:36,480
We have two guests coming on did rocks who posted all of the Ubuntu gnome journey posts for the 1710 release cycle shares

19
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,460
some insights including an anecdote that

20
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:46,500
That occurred just before just before 1710 went live that hasn't been posted anywhere because they're all too exhausted

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,460
And if you think that those final ISOs are final, maybe not maybe maybe not

22
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:57,380
Yeah, so it's an interesting anecdote. We'll get to that and then we'll cook the Ubuntu desktop manager joins us

23
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,260
And I got a couple of hard questions for him

24
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:08,140
specifically, I want to know if them dropping unity sort of takes away some of their strategic advantage of controlling their own desktop and

25
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,980
I

26
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:17,060
Ask him if canonicals goals with snaps are going to impact the relationship with gnome

27
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,740
Which obviously they are very dependent on now and I'm just curious how he sees that relationship

28
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,480
So those those amongst other questions will cook answers and just a little bit in the show

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,740
but of course we have a whole bunch of community news to get into and we have a

30
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,820
I'll say a humble virtual look today. Hello mumble room. Thank you for joining us. Hello

31
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,180
Hello robot arms, so we have a couple of guys which actually the best guys we have the best people

32
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,780
I'm told people tell me these are the best so we have much to get into today

33
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,580
But I wanted to take a moment and share my fugue state of reinstalling computers with you. Just for a moment

34
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,700
I've gone full maniac. I haven't been on a tear like this in years and

35
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,940
And it's really morphed into something perverted. That's gonna give me people are gonna give me crap

36
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,220
I'm gonna tell you guys something in this in in just because it's content

37
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,140
Yeah, sit down if you need to be prepared, please go gentle on me when I tell you this, please

38
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,820
But I have to I have to be honest with you. I have been installing

39
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,660
Ubuntu 1604

40
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,900
Like crazy did no one make you do this. No, it's happening. He and I have almost swapped positions again

41
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,700
It's kind of funny. It's kind of funny and totally unrelated. He and I just had a conversation about this

42
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,780
I had a you know

43
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,340
I just had a I had a kind of I had a come-to-linus moment where I was

44
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,620
sitting here in the studio getting ready to reload the next machine and

45
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,420
You'll understand more after my interview with will cook by the way

46
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,860
This this will give you some of the insights as to why I've made my decision

47
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,700
but I decided after evaluating gnome plasma Mate or Mate and

48
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,180
unity 7

49
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,540
For the studio where we have some high DPI requirements non. We have some touchscreen requirements and don't I?

50
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,580
Evaluated those desktops to see if they could who would be the best one in fact

51
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,620
I didn't even intend to evaluate unity it just sort of happened by mistake

52
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,140
I never even gave any considerations just one of the systems happen to have it on there and

53
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,300
After trying all these desktops for production

54
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:21,800
I know you guys get sick of hearing this, but I'm just I decided that don't don't give me shit, but it's actually unity 7

55
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,240
it's

56
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,040
Ironically unity 7 it's the most stable it seems to perform the best under load and

57
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,640
It has polish in areas that that matter to me. I'm not saying it's better than gnome

58
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,740
But I am saying that for areas that matter to me. It's better than known and so I'll give you a couple examples

59
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,480
Multi-monitor support is is still better in unity would guess what we use a lot here in the studio

60
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:51,040
I I still prefer the way that they handle the launcher

61
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,140
I still prefer that's that system that that that super key system and instead of the way that gnome implements

62
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,520
It's not a big difference, but I do prefer it

63
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,140
There's others

64
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,820
There's other things though that are like

65
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,440
Rough edges that have been rounded off by unity where you can tell that a lot of thought it's it's ironically in some ways a lot

66
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,760
like when I use

67
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,560
elementary OS you car you are struck with

68
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,240
And you and maybe Dan could talk about this a bit, but you are struck with

69
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,520
Shit somebody thought of that

70
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:24,800
Somebody somebody actually thought of that and solve that problem for me and when you hit when that hits you a few times you're like

71
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,920
Oh, man, this is there is that there is something else going on here that I've missed

72
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,280
And I don't know Dan if you want to expand upon the point of where sometimes some projects are willing to spend I would assume

73
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,800
You tell me if I'm wrong a hell of a lot of time on something a lot of other people might not even consider important

74
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,440
Yeah, I mean, I think it just comes from just dogfooding and obsessive perfectionism

75
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,040
Just hating yourself enough to sit through it

76
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,980
You know good way to put it and I mean grinding your way through it and punishing yourself as you just keep working away at it

77
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,520
Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you remember the first versions of unity were awful, you know

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,600
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right and it the same thing for any software

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,340
I think the first versions are like this is what we assume is gonna be good and then they're terrible and then it's you know

80
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,720
You you grind through it and you iterate on it you go

81
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,160
Okay, this is what we learned and changed and you know

82
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,200
That's really you know

83
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,800
That's been happening to the plasma desktop and know them too

84
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,280
Like they've all been going through iterative releases where they've been getting better and better. I I switched over full-time to gnome 3

85
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,560
when

86
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,880
3.12

87
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,920
Was sort of the main release and I think every release since then has been getting progressively better

88
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,920
And I was very excited about gnome 3 for a long time and I never switched away from unity

89
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:48,560
Because of gnome 3 I didn't switch away because of right because of that I switched away from unity because I switched to arch and

90
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:55,280
With that I switched to gnome and I was excited by the idea of a polished desktop for all distributions

91
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,500
That's really what fired me up about gnome coming back to it now

92
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,520
Now I have a different mindset in the studio. These are not machines that I use to enjoy

93
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,800
I don't use these to play like I don't really play a lot of video games

94
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,920
But I do play with my computer alone and these are not computers I play with so it doesn't matter if they're appliances

95
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:17,160
And so when I sat down to load 1710 with the new gnome 3 desktop, I said well, okay

96
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:25,520
what what what is 1710 giving me that 1604 doesn't because we've already got a 1604 machine in production that has been rock-solid and

97
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,160
Beard and I looked up the packages that we need and we didn't see any all the software we needed is available

98
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,880
Wow. Yeah, and it struck me. This is not the same

99
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,360
Path it was back when you in 1404 or 1204 before especially

100
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,240
Yeah, the LTS as your desktop now is much more doable every single package

101
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,160
I wanted was available for 1604 without I used to come on air and say

102
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,660
Ubuntu LTS desktops are the hardest distro to install software on because after about a year and a half

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,300
Nobody makes offer for it anymore and all your PPAs break

104
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,840
Everybody's making software for it now every every single app that I've installed via a dead was all available for 1604

105
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,720
or snaps and

106
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,280
Including OBS and ffmpeg versions that we used to not be able to get. Yeah, it's it's just a different

107
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,840
It's just a different landscape now

108
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,360
and so I I just kind of made like this business decision that I was going to deploy 1604 and

109
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,120
Just I got six months until the next LTS comes out if I want and then I made then once I made that decision

110
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,280
I made the part that I've actually been building to because I know we've been talking a lot about Ubuntu

111
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
This is kind of the last big episode on it

112
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,800
For a while and I decided if I'm going to be practical and be all business-like with my machines and go 1604

113
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,880
Why not also experiment with deploying Ubuntu's product or canonicals product called landscape?

114
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,920
Now landscape is sort of a central management

115
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,240
Platform where you can also do inventory package management user management script management

116
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
performance monitoring

117
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,400
all of these things across all your machines from one central place and

118
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,080
You get like a hundred credits for free

119
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,640
For the first 60 days or something like that

120
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
And I think it works out depending on which

121
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,160
Tier you get it works out to be about five dollars a month

122
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,280
And if you're watching the video version right now, I have got my landscape account up on the screen

123
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,960
I've got five machines registered these this is the tear I've been on recently as these five and

124
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,860
You can see just by a quick glance that I have two outstanding alerts over these five machines

125
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,840
One computer has upgrade packages available and one computer has been upgraded but needs to be rebooted

126
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,200
Yeah, that's not too bad

127
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,760
But there's some things that are actually really quite neat about it

128
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,280
One thing is the performance monitoring so I can pull up graphs across all of our studio systems

129
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,840
And I can see if one system is under a quite a bit more load than the other system

130
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,680
I can see at what times that is like if it's show times or if it's non show times memory usage swap usage

131
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,920
temperatures for the storage and for the

132
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,640
hardware and

133
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,680
Any of this can be downloaded as a CSV and I can I can zoom in and just look at one machine for any of this

134
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,080
Information or I can get all of the machines, which is the which is the screen

135
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,080
We're looking at right now if you're watching the video version

136
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,720
Additionally, like I said, it also kind of has like an inventory management aspect to it

137
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,100
So I can click in and get the hardware information so you can see here is the precision

138
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,560
7720 that I'm using at the lady dupes office quote-unquote, which is a chair and

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,840
It has a boon to 1604 3 on it. It's got the xeon e3

140
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,160
1535 m6 processors in it 64 gigabytes of RAM

141
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,280
You know gives you the whole hardware spec any kind of technician notes that are on it

142
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,840
You can change its power state or schedule a reboot change which groups it or it is in you can go in even further and get

143
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,040
more detailed things like serial numbers and bio states and

144
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Mac addresses and all the things you would get from an inventory management system as well as monitoring and alerting if there's an outage

145
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,000
Which is great

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,860
And of course the thing that I really signed up for is and this this has just been really nice for me is

147
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,880
Package management and they break it out in a way that is easy to read

148
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,680
So like here's the crack lib dash runtime and instead of some complicated CVE thing

149
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,000
It's just runtime support for a password checker library

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,680
It gives it gives me real English descriptions of what these vulnerabilities are

151
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,080
And so I I and then if I expand it I get all the CVEs I get everything

152
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,600
But I am able to make a like an educated decision if that's worth me interrupting one of our production systems

153
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,040
And I've been using this. I don't know if I'm gonna keep it once

154
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,320
You know, I'm gonna keep I don't know

155
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,880
I don't fuck you

156
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,600
But once my hundred credits runs out if it if I find it makes it easier for us to do IT in the studio

157
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,140
Which is kind of always a time suck for either the beard or myself. I think I do it

158
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,320
You also get alerts so you can see I've got one computer that has the packages

159
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,340
One computer that needs to be rebooted and I could issue that reboot from here, of course

160
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,160
So I I'll go ahead and I'll issue the reboot command to the precision. That's nice

161
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,880
Yeah, and I can just say restart as soon as possible and machines that need to be restarted

162
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,660
Also get a little icon next to their name a little like a weird

163
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,560
Yeah, and so that's what I've been playing with since our last episode

164
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,360
I know it's sort of I've explained it before this show is sort of like the deep space nine of

165
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,680
Linux podcasts where sometimes we have continuing story arcs that we keep going back on and this has been one of them and

166
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,760
I think my takeaway from it is I

167
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,120
Forgot I forgot how much I liked unity and I've never been a unity hater

168
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,000
So it's not like I'm reversing some position I've taken but I haven't been a unity user and I've been a baby a unity denier

169
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,560
Like I just pretend like it doesn't exist

170
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,200
Like I did like when we were first evaluating desktops, I didn't even consider unity

171
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,160
Like it didn't even come because it's that thing that only a boon to has right? Yeah

172
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,200
So you don't really think of it as the first class? No, and then all of a sudden

173
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
I'm like well, but I'm gonna install boon to oh

174
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,680
And stay tuned for the interview with will cook because you'll see why it may actually work out to be a really great long-term bet here

175
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,680
In a little bit. Did you have anything you look like you had something you were pontificating on over there?

176
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,220
Are you just dreading us formatting the last of these machines? I'm dreading having to support unity grace

177
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,580
Hopefully you won't have to well you'll love that comp is window effects. Let me tell you let me tell you well in the meantime

178
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,320
The media is continuing their freakout. Yes. I said the media is continuing their freakout about Cody

179
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,640
I don't know why it's Cody

180
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:12,160
That's that's the thing they hate and I do have a theory but I am really worried here because if you read this story

181
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,600
And this is this is unfortunate Brian Barrett over at wired and I generally like wired stuff

182
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,680
Just did a real hit piece against Cody

183
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,880
but it's actually it's an indictment of open source and that's what it concerns me is you could remove Cody and you could put a

184
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:32,800
Lot of other project names in the spaces and have the same damn problems even just desktop distros

185
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,080
So here's its start. I mean it starts with a vengeance

186
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,480
The Cody box pitch is hard to resist a little black plastic square

187
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,000
Not much different than a Roku or at Apple TV and similar in function as well this streamer though

188
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:55,400
Offers something those others never will free access to practically any show or movie you can dream of no rental fees

189
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,480
No subscriptions, just type in the name of a blockbuster and start watching in high-definition streams in seconds

190
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,440
What are we doing here? Let's just we don't need to do this whole thing damn

191
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,940
And of course if I'm if I'm an industry executive reading that and wired I just poop myself a little bit

192
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,400
Oh, yeah that I'm the one writing this but I won't I won't despair the author here

193
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:22,120
He goes on he makes he does write some interesting history about Cody and the XP MC connection if you're curious and does mention

194
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,160
A few things here and there but gets a few stingers in that really is the part that I go

195
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Oh god, this could be any open source project

196
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,520
Like any open source ecosystem Cody contains multitudes. There are the Cody media player itself

197
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:41,920
There's the TV add-ons and other developer communities and there are the plugins that scraped the internet for pirated material

198
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,320
Those are what transformed Cody into the modern-day pirates favorite ship

199
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
It's a bit of a Wild West

200
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,600
Cody's open source anyone can take that software and put any piece and put it on any hardware and

201
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:01,760
The industry has thrived too because it's managed to stay relatively underground at least in the u.s

202
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,520
Which is funny because if you look at statistics for torrent downloads

203
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,480
They've gone from like damn near 30% of internet traffic to like 5% of internet traffic

204
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,600
So torrent piracy is way down and that's what these plugins do is they're torrent plugins that are capable of

205
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Ordering the torrent in a way that lets them stream in real time. That's what these plugins are doing

206
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,560
and if you you have to do it that way because if you just did HTTP streams you get shut down immediately and

207
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,640
You could say that Ubuntu mate is a enabler of

208
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,920
Terrorist activities because maybe they used Ubuntu mate to plan a terrorist attack

209
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,200
this this is a really really slippery slope and

210
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:49,480
The Kodi project has had at least here in the US has had to make a really interesting response to cover their own asses

211
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,960
Because they're becoming the poster child the the context here is this story

212
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,560
I'm covering for you is is damn near a weekly story

213
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,120
If not, at least a twice a month story and I covered it a long time ago on the show and I decided to cover it

214
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,920
Again to illustrate to you that it's a problem that is not going away and I'm I am a bit concerned about this to tell you

215
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,720
the truth and

216
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,920
the Kodi project has had to respond in a way that I don't like and I can't see how they could have handled this any

217
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,160
Other way and the the thing that sucks is I could see other open source projects having to do the same thing

218
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,280
Well, first of all, they got to get all business-like then they have to lawyer up and then they have to go sue the shit

219
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:33,720
And anybody that sells anything that says Kodi that isn't just straight vanilla build from the project's website

220
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,960
Because that then they can tell the courts but look we're trying to fight this

221
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,640
We're trying to go after these guys because our pure Kodi project doesn't have these plugins

222
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,960
So we're going after them. But of course all if this is this is a short-term play because they're just stopped putting coding the name

223
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,320
Here's a quote from the Kodi project or I guess the Kodi company

224
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,280
We're basically taking the stance that if you use the word Kodi to mean something other than the vanilla software

225
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,480
We release if you pre-install add-ons or something like that

226
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,880
That means you're no longer shipping Kodi and we consider it a trademark violation

227
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,720
That's he goes on to comment that's sort of worked. We've been able to get a bunch of sellers off eBay and Amazon that way

228
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,120
Man I mean you could legitimately w get could be put in this position

229
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,520
this is bad and

230
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,520
I what it feels like to me when I read Brian's post here and I'm sure Brian Barrett is not a tool of the

231
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,360
Copyright industrial complex, but when I read this post

232
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,880
It feels like media executives that are super worried about their fiefdoms being torn down by this internet thing

233
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,680
And so they've got to start casting shade as much as possible and delegitimizing these things

234
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,040
And getting people to go into the grooves that are Roku Apple TV

235
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,520
And the things that are built to sell you content that is DRM and licensed

236
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,720
And this is part of the strategy. Oh, yeah

237
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,040
The reason why it's in Wired is because it's appealing to the geek audience with this one and that's also why you have the back

238
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,760
History of XBMC, you know, it's just it's appealing to the geeks. You got to get all the demos

239
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,360
You got to get the executives. You got to get the geeks. You got to get all the demos

240
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,760
Make sure you really get this this whole thing locked down and I worry about the Kodi project

241
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,120
So I have a link in the show notes if you want to read the whole thing because I did just give you some of the

242
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
highlights

243
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,960
I hate to see it happen to Kodi

244
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,040
And I hate to see them have to become super litigious because of it. This is a uh, yeah

245
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,880
It's a bad culture for everyone who's involved instead of just being like hey Kodi's awesome

246
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,760
And it's a great useful open source project. You want to talk about something positive to oh, please just sort of

247
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,320
If you have any I don't have any new flat pack. Oh new flat pack. Does it come itself in a flat pack?

248
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,520
How does that work? Well, the flat pack may be getting a little flatter and easier for people to understand or stable

249
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,520
So this is uh, we're going to be talking about a little bit more about that in a little bit

250
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,640
Um, so this is uh, we got we got two things actually. It's kind of neat

251
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
You're going to have flat pack 0.10

252
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,600
Which is going to be like a we won't call it LTS, but it's going to be the stable series of flat pack

253
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,520
The 0.10. Okay, and then you're going to have the fancy

254
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,760
0.11 which will get all the new features all the new

255
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,880
Yeah, so 0.10

256
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,760
The first one is going to be the first in a release of new

257
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,120
In a series of new releases that are stable new features will all be added to the 0.11

258
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,200
Branch and bug fixes will be back ported to the 0.10 branch

259
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,800
Which seems like a great way to put something in production but keep improving on it

260
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,200
And then maybe all those accumulate to like a 0.12 and you start having like a kernel versioning system

261
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,000
It's kind of impressive that they're already doing this sort of like a lot of projects takes a long time for them to get like a

262
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,640
Real development release workflow, but they're still at the you know

263
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,200
They're not even at like a real full release yet and yet they're they're doing this well. Yeah

264
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,360
Yeah, and um, we saw recently that the mint project is going in with uh

265
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,440
Uh flat packs because they kind of like the more ppa run your own repo

266
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,880
Uh solution than the centralized store solution and you can see how there could be different advantages to both

267
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,000
And and meanwhile the folks over at elementary os have put published an update on the state of the app center

268
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
So we had dan on the show dan

269
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,200
I mean was it how long ago?

270
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
Did you guys did you come on the show to talk about the app center was?

271
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,320
We did a special ages ago. Oh, I think I think it was maybe six months. I can't remember. Yeah six months and um

272
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,400
Uh now you guys have got over 50 apps and they're looking good. So what's going on with the app center? How are things?

273
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,320
Yeah, it's going pretty well

274
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,760
Um, like you said it's been about six months and we have uh over 50 apps now actually as of this morning

275
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,640
We have 58 apps. Oh, yeah in there

276
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,080
So yeah, i'm pretty excited about it

277
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,000
There's there's all kinds of cool stuff in there

278
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,920
I mean things that I never expected people to write and it's been really awesome to see like an explosion of native apps

279
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:52,640
Like they're not web apps or or cross-platform ports or anything like that. They're all gtk high dpi ready and

280
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,800
It's pretty sweet looking good on the desktop on the desktop, too

281
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:03,120
Um, so are you uh, are you are you talking all talking at all about any kind of the uh, money?

282
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,520
That's been made or if it's profitable at all or anything like that

283
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,560
Um, I mean I could I could give you some like little stats here and there. Um, I I

284
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,760
I want to be careful because there's people's privacy in question, right? And I don't want to everything's still new

285
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,040
Bust somebody out on how much money they make but um, I can tell you that

286
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,160
Um, nobody's making a living right now. It's still in the realm of like beer money

287
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,920
Um, one of the developers told me uh, it's enough that I could take my wife out to dinner. That's nice

288
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,440
I mean, that's really great. That's going from zero to that is really great

289
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,640
Yeah, so, you know it like you said it's going from zero to to something is you know, it's an improvement

290
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,440
But we you know, we still have a long way to go like our eventual goal

291
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:51,520
Is that we do want people to make a living so we've been talking to different people about um, you know

292
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,760
The kind of the problems that they have or what would encourage them to pay more

293
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,000
Uh, I know a lot of people want a flow for them to be able to pay later

294
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
So they want to be able to download free at first and then come back and pay

295
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,860
And the store isn't really good at handling that right now. You'd have to like uninstall and re-download

296
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,200
Okay. Yeah, that seems though. It seems like sort of that seems like a sort of a problem that other app stores struggle with

297
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,560
Yeah, definitely

298
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Yeah, so that's something that we can be better at. You know, I was wondering as an end user. Um,

299
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,480
What are my expectations for when like, uh, like uh changes come to the app center?

300
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,920
Is it is that a release based thing like new releases of elementary os will have new app center

301
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,600
Updates with features or is it something's updated separately of the main os release?

302
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,520
And we're releasing updates all the time. We don't freeze application updates at all

303
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,680
Um, even for all our apps even like we we post a blog post every month where we talk about the updates we've made

304
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,080
And um our our average right now is that um,

305
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,720
The average app center app has received around five updates in the last six months. Gosh. You guys are doing great

306
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,640
Wow, these are some good stuff here. So I also noticed that it seemed like there was some interest in the app center, uh, by uh,

307
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
system 76

308
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah, so one of the things that um, we kind of set out to do when we built app center is making sure that we were

309
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
using all of open standards

310
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,160
And so that's awesome for system 76 because since we use package kit and we use app stream for our metadata

311
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,960
They can use our client in pop os and just do some branding work and they really like the way that it works

312
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,440
So they can really benefit as a downstream from this work

313
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,560
Cool, so they're essentially able to I guess white label it in in other words and uh, make it system 76 or pop os branded

314
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,760
Yeah, so they've got a couple of little tweaks in there and we've been talking to them about uh,

315
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:44,640
How we can upstream some of their changes maybe cool. Um, but I I guess the major difference between their they're calling it pop shop

316
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,040
um, the major difference between pop shop and app center is that um,

317
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,600
They aren't using our app center repository. So it's kind of just um a front end for the ubuntu repositories

318
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,760
Instead of uh our app center repository

319
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,120
I'm going to be really curious to see I want to play with that because it's probably a better experience than gnome software

320
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,160
I'll love to gnome software. You guys are doing great. Uh, but uh, you know

321
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,120
I've also played with app center and I found it to be a I don't know a better experience. I would put it

322
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,880
Um good for them and I wonder if we might see other distributions take that on too. I think that's a great idea

323
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,360
So i'm looking at the post i'll have a link in the show notes

324
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,320
Uh anything else you want to call out about the six month anniversary?

325
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,520
Um, just definitely that if you have an idea for an app, uh, you know

326
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:34,240
Or you want to get involved with either the front end of app center or the back end of the app center dashboard

327
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,560
It's written in node.js. It's all open source

328
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,720
Like we'd love for you to be part of this ecosystem and and there's you know

329
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,000
Tons of different ways that you can fit into it. Definitely and um,

330
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,120
I'm glad to see progress in like the right directions on some of several fronts on this. Uh, you're right

331
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,600
And just to reiterate you said it but it's awesome

332
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,960
I mean, it's not just like 50 more than 50 apps hitting an app center. It's 50 apps

333
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,480
Written for linux gtk plus high dpi ready fully native. Wow

334
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,520
Yeah, you know

335
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,080
I think one of my favorite things that they've done that a lot of the other app stores don't do is they have links

336
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
Directly to issue trackers. Oh, yeah

337
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,000
That's yeah, that's a great idea. That's really handy. Wow. Yeah, you know, that's been a big one because i've definitely watched people

338
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,480
Having that direct link i've been able to go file issues and developers are able to fix them really quickly and push out the updates

339
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,200
Like whenever they want we have a super tight feedback loop between users reporting issues and developers taking out updates to fix them

340
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,360
Yeah, if you guys are looking for an app to check out, uh, I suggest torrential, uh, which is a torrent app that I checked out

341
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:42,160
Awesome, just nice simple clean fast a good performance really liked it torrential and it fits right in on the desktop

342
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,520
It's it's a great experience and you know what when you guys launch it

343
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,080
I said it then i'll say it now i'm really glad somebody's doing this because I think if we can even just say

344
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,560
There's there's uh, even if elementary os proves out that there is interest in a linux consumer market. I think that's beneficial

345
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
So awesome guys. Well

346
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:08,560
Uh dan and i'll also say to cassidy because he was the one that wrote the or at least made the post over at medium a great

347
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,160
Work gentleman and great work for the whole team and great work to all the software developers, too

348
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Thanks. Yeah, that's really good stuff now

349
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:22,800
Everybody knows that there's one threat to the human race that goes beyond nukes goes beyond rocks from space

350
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,160
I mean i'm not the one saying this it's elon musk saying it it's ai ai is going to doom us all

351
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,780
Ai is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization

352
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,680
um

353
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,200
in a way that

354
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,880
car accidents

355
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
airplane crashes

356
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Faulty drugs

357
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,280
Or bad food were not they were not they were harmful to

358
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,440
A set of individuals within society, of course, but they were not harmful to society as a whole

359
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,000
um ai is

360
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,980
A fundamental existential risk for human civilization

361
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,480
Whoa, that is not mincing words at all

362
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:10,240
And so that is the context in which we view this next story at&t is working on an open-sourced ai project with

363
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,640
the linux foundation

364
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,760
Yeah

365
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,160
And it's going to be called the oh, I just the first time I realized I had to say it out loud akumas

366
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,400
akumas

367
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,120
A cu mos akumas akumas

368
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,720
Yeah, the akumas project which aims to be a marketplace of artificial intelligent apps and services

369
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:35,540
So linux foundation today announced that it's working on an open-source ai project at&t is one of the founding organizations

370
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,320
In my past experience this usually means that at&t is going to be the predominant contributor and therefore the driving force

371
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,000
Uh, we'll see something like hey, we have this stuff

372
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,640
We don't know how to shepherd or steward it. But uh, if you guys do we'll give you this big chunk of code

373
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,680
Well, it's sort of that definitely. Yeah. Um also hey, can you help us with a community aspect?

374
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,680
But it's it's even more than that

375
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:05,060
It's we don't think we can make a buck off the core technology, but we know we can make a buck off of ancillary services

376
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,240
and

377
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,280
services

378
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,400
So if we could get this thing to be a market winner

379
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,200
Then we would make a ton of bank, but we're not going to make bank actually selling it itself

380
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
So why don't we hand this over to linux foundation?

381
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,200
Because then people are willing to take it as a standard because it's not coming from at&t

382
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,120
And I would assume at&t is probably a company that could cook something up like this

383
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,240
Might actually be able to give google or amazon a run for its money

384
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,600
They certainly have a lot of yeah a lot of money resources that sort of thing

385
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:31,920
Yeah

386
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:38,320
But I think instead of like a core ai its goal is more like a platform is to enable a free exchange of ideas as they

387
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,200
Say and machine learning solutions, which is an interesting that would be interesting a marketplace and a platform for machine learning solutions

388
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,600
Using artificial intelligent frameworks you guys got your buzz bingo. Yeah, right

389
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,960
They want like tools for casual users not just data scientists

390
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,560
So maybe something that like we could actually go play with hey, you never know sticking apps

391
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,960
And microservices. There we go. I had to make sure we got the whole bingo. Oh, yeah, that's important

392
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,800
Oh that was this interesting development now

393
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,400
Here's the reality of it and they say this in the gadget post that we'll have linked

394
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,980
The project code will be available near to the platform's launch in early 2018

395
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,500
So maybe we might follow up on the story when that happens if there's some uh, yeah

396
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,200
They got like a real minimal landing page. You can go check out at uh, acumos.org

397
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,060
But the fact that they're even talking about this means that there's probably I bet you a pretty

398
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,140
Significant chunk of this thing developed if I if I were to wager how these companies work

399
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,120
They generally have almost the whole damn thing lined up and now it's really a matter of licensing partners

400
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,780
Branding marketing the new logos for the new name because there might be a name change now that they're making it a public project

401
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,220
And so they have all these old names in there and all that has to be done

402
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:48,020
Before they can actually hand it over to linux foundation and that's all the shit that's happening now

403
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,540
So the code's written

404
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:56,420
But all this other stupid bureaucratic crap is what's gonna take until then it can finally make its way to github or wherever

405
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:59,940
It's going to live right? Yeah. Yeah, and then either it will go nowhere

406
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,740
Or it may be successful, you know

407
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:09,220
I'm still watching the edge x foundry stuff that del contributed the linux foundation for iot and I actually think it's a great solution because

408
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,100
quick recap

409
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,580
it's like an iot firewall and it it it takes all your iot devices and

410
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,140
Manages them locally on your LAN and then of course can enable remote connections and stuff like that

411
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,500
But it's um, it's it's it's way more. It's way more privacy inclined. It's way more local

412
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,980
It's it allows you to build your own custom iot network using a set of apis and frameworks

413
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:35,620
They created that can enable alerting and automatic response and all of this and none of it's connected to the internet or cloud

414
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:40,740
it absolutely can be and you can even use remote services including the echo stuff, but um,

415
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,580
You can all run on the LAN and uh, that seems like that would be a thing

416
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,220
But uh so far I haven't heard a lot of buzz. They've had an update. They've had a big software update

417
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,460
it also seems like uh, these are the sorts of things that

418
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,020
They kind of go without buzz maybe because the people who end up getting adopted are right

419
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,780
Like I mean think there's part of a solution there. They are an implementation detail

420
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,380
They are not the product like think about uh open daylight when we went and checked that out

421
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,180
Like I hadn't heard a bunch about it, but then here's all these different people from different big companies using it

422
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:08,900
Yep, yeah

423
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:15,140
Because it's like it's how linus sees linux in a lot of ways linus says that linux is often just in implementation detail

424
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,620
Uh, it reminds me of the anecdote that when steve jobs, uh was still alive

425
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:25,220
He tried very aggressively to buy dropbox years and years ago and his pitch to them was

426
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:32,820
You should come work for us because you are a feature not a product and you will get replaced by the platform eventually

427
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:40,020
And uh to some extent he's right. You now have you have google drive. You have microsoft one drive. You have apple's icloud thing

428
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,860
But dropbox is competing

429
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,940
But just like that edgex foundry

430
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:52,680
And uh now this project. What was it akumas project akumas. There we go beards saying that he's the official pronunciation

431
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,520
It may just be an implement implementation detail for a marketplace or something

432
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,920
Just like linux is often an implementation detail for a mobile device for a phone

433
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,760
Did they say anything about what license is going to be? No, I don't know if you saw

434
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,560
Did you see anything on their holding page? It's definitely not in the news. No

435
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,240
No, and I don't know if I don't probably may not know until I get it up on github

436
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,160
Well, i'm just saying ant is popular with the bsd licenses

437
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:21,160
i'm, just wondering if we can connect the mycroft project with this with this project and have some sort of like

438
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:27,160
Like sped up sped up collaboration here where maybe solutions and and tricks could be built over in one spot

439
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,000
And they can be deployed to i'm just saying mycroft, please for the love of god mycroft

440
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,480
I don't know if I want a mycroft overlord

441
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,320
I'd take it more than an echo or a google or a any other one. That's for damn sure

442
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,080
I want it on all the things

443
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,720
You know what else is good for all the things linux academy if you want something for your linux box if you want to learn

444
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
about some of these cloud services

445
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,200
Cloud service eye is that yep, that's it when you're talking about multiple cloud services cloud service eye

446
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,280
Is that a thing or cloud survey?

447
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,120
Well linux academy can help you sort it all out. They got the right terms. I'm sure

448
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
I like that linuxacademy.com

449
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,760
Unplugged that's where you go to support this show and sign up for a free seven day trial

450
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,240
And a seven-day trial is going to

451
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,840
Pretty much let you get a good sense of their self-paced in-depth video courses their hands-on labs

452
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,760
Their learning paths if you want to go for a set course in your career

453
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:24,360
Their practice exams to get you ready for quizzes their certification training if that's your goal. You'll get a sense for some of that

454
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,160
They've also got virtual servers. They'll spin up on demand that matches your courseware

455
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,600
So say you chose debian, right then the virtual machine's also debian. I just love that feature

456
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,520
Not only do I love the feature, but uh, I that's when they were building that that's when we were really talking a lot

457
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:48,040
Uh before about them becoming a sponsor and oh man, they were so proud of that system because you got real linux geeks

458
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,280
At the core of this company real linux geeks

459
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,040
And then they worked with some of the best educators and developers to create this platform

460
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,760
And now they've got full-time human instructors when you need help

461
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:03,320
They got a community stacked full of jupyter broadcasting members that are vibrant and active and they can participate in the content to a degree

462
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,640
To like the flashcard systems forkable by the community

463
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,120
They have ios and android apps to let you study on the go and speaking of studying on the go

464
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:15,240
They also have lesson audio and notebooks and study guides you can download and well, you know

465
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,040
If you're doing that offline thing, it'll work just fine turns out paper has a great battery life

466
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:26,200
Who knew it's crazy and it's got a pretty good contrast ratio last millennium's technology

467
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:33,480
Linux academy.com slash unplugged linux academy.com slash unplugged you go there you get the seven day free trial and you support the show

468
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,880
Thanks to linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program program program

469
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:43,400
Um, let's talk about uh, the intel me stuff just really quick. This is the management engine stuff

470
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,400
That's actually like an edison system. If you're not familiar with edison, that's like a x86 system on a chip

471
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,400
thing

472
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:57,720
It's actually fascinating because it originates from the 486 and then they've like modernized the 486

473
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,560
And this is what makes up the edison

474
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:05,800
So it's like a it's like the it's like the best things about the intel 486 with some of the best things about modern processors

475
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,440
Um for uh for crazy cheap price and a crazy even cheaper for intel

476
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:17,320
So of course intel has now built their management engine on more recent intel boxes off this x86 system

477
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,160
And this is a huge problem

478
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,200
Because that means your basic bitch hacker is now going to be able to poke at this thing

479
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,780
I mean i'm i'm i'm being a little generous but it's it goes from this weird esoteric architecture

480
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,540
Where there aren't very many debugging tools to rip this thing apart

481
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:42,940
And it requires these crazy hardware bridges to connect to it to now it's x86 code running on a pc

482
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,500
And it just fundamentally changes the game and I think i'm speculating here

483
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,300
But I think this is why google is now getting in the game of getting out of intel me

484
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:58,220
We recently talked about purism doing it now google's going even further. They've started the nerf project

485
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:05,260
It's short for the non-extensible reduced firmware and it's their effort to replace most of the uefi

486
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:13,180
Firmware with a small linux kernel and init ram fs and a custom portion of code written in the go programming language

487
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:18,540
That's right. Everyone you liked linux. We're putting linux in your linux. So double linux boot

488
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:25,180
Yeah, this is uh from one of from ron one of google's core boot developers. Uh, he was in munich. No minnick

489
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:32,460
Talk i'm horrible. I'm the worst person ever talking about their nerf project at this week's embedded european linux conference

490
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:37,260
So look that shit up nerf delivers linux performance and reliability in its firmware

491
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,180
Oh

492
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,340
Don't show that to alan jude. Oh my god. Don't show that to anyways as well

493
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:50,220
It also emulates all post boot activity of the uefi and more importantly the management engine

494
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,780
Rather than allowing it to run concurrently in the background, which that creepy son of a bitch is doing

495
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,780
Yeah, while your os is running. It's really awful. I really hate it currently

496
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:04,620
The nerf effort is focused on intel hardware hardware while the core boot developers acknowledge that the latest amd chips

497
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,460
Are closed up too and don't believe all you read about ryzen they say

498
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,100
Well, that's a bit of a bomb at the end. What does that mean?

499
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:18,140
I gotta say the slides for this they're they're posted here. They're definitely worth checking out

500
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:23,740
There's no video yet, but it's it's really easy to read through i'm very intrigued with this project

501
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,820
Yeah nerf also great name great name and it's fun to say. Yeah, it's it's really great

502
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,940
So he says that uh, he says it also has a 32 32x speed up and boot time

503
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,860
Oh because you can probably skip a whole bunch of shit

504
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,820
Because you can go from one linux kernel to the next

505
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,460
And just and kexec is already a thing that they're using. I wonder so and all the use

506
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:51,340
So all of the user lands written in go you eliminate all uefi uefi and all management engine post boot activity

507
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:56,860
yeah, they basically did a bunch of work and they kind of talk about it here to like identify every piece of uefi that

508
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:02,700
They could do without including like uefi has an ip tcp ip stack sometimes, right?

509
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:08,220
And a whole bunch of other stuff and it's like well, we already have this open source kernel that we use are using

510
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,540
All the time. Why not use this too and they're looking at it from the

511
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:19,420
Attack vector and and and control vector and not so much from the freedom vector

512
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,460
Which is interesting because they're still ending up with the same results to a degree

513
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,660
So here's they say the core problem. Yeah, according to the google developer linux

514
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:33,580
No longer controls the x86 platform between linux and the hardware. There are at least two and a half kernels

515
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,220
I'm gonna read that again because just wrap your head around that for a second

516
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:40,860
Isn't this reminding you of the baseband problem with your cell phone between linux and the hardware?

517
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,200
There are at least two and a half kernels. They are completely proprietary

518
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,320
And exploit friendly and the exploits can persist i.e

519
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,360
Be written to flash and you can't fix them. That's the core problem that google's trying to solve and

520
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,160
You know, they're really concerned about server security because they're looking at this not for desktops and laptops

521
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,000
They're looking at this for servers. Exactly. Uh, and then you're right. Jeez west. This is a super awesome

522
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,120
Uh, i'm looking at this, uh this presentation. Um

523
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,120
We can you toss a link to that in this section of the show because that is

524
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,680
That is worth reading. Okay, so we have just a couple more community updates before we can get into the interviews

525
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,840
And this story today's a breaking news story. I should have gotten like some sort of soundboard clip. The appeals court is uh, surprising us

526
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,320
Get ready for the story that has literally spun my in spawn span my entire podcasting career

527
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
It's this is unbelievable

528
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,560
Sco's back

529
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:43,520
Sco is back. No is back suing ibm in the appeals court. It's it's back on the sco versus ibm case

530
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,320
lives it's

531
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,480
Just done. So, okay. Let's recap last year us district judge david nuffers. God damn it chris

532
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,040
This is not your i'm gonna stop saying names for the rest of the episode has ruled against ruled against sco

533
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,960
um

534
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,880
In two summary judgment orders and the court refused to allow sco to amend its initial complaint about against ibm

535
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,840
We all said okay story's done sco's done this story. This is like a year ago where it said it's all done

536
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,840
But then sco soon appealed which didn't surprise too many of us, of course

537
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,960
But it happened and we've been kind of waiting around to see where this appeal is going to go

538
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
Well on monday the 10th u.s

539
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,900
Circuit court of appeals found that sco's claim of misappropriation

540
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,720
Could go forward while also upholding the judge's previous other two orders

541
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,520
so this is i'll get to it in a second is because it's kind of complicated but

542
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:38,160
If you haven't been following this story since march of 2003, I can understand. Um, I don't know why I have to be honest with you

543
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,900
So anyways sco then named then named caldera systems filed a suit against ibm in march of 2003

544
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,520
For allegedly contributing sections of commercial unix code that they thought they owned from the unix system 5

545
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,720
I think it was which the scope group was pissed and said you contributed that to the linux code base

546
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,660
There by sort of forcibly open sourcing it they argued that ibm essentially stole or misappropriated

547
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,120
Its proprietary code known as unix where system release 4

548
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,240
in the may 4 2001 release of the

549
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,240
Monterey operating system a new version of unix designed for ibm's power processors. It was incomplete didn't have a compiler

550
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,440
It wasn't like a complete

551
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,880
Um os and so sco claims that it was ibm

552
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,200
Uh, basically dumping to get the code out there on the on when ibm released that that same day, uh,

553
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:35,760
Sco argues that ibm released a sham version of the system in order to legitimize its own general distribution of the ax power product

554
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Which contained sco's code?

555
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,360
They say that they what ibm basically did was did a sham release of an os that had their code in it

556
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,600
So that way when they later then released another os they could say but there's precedent

557
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,560
There's other operating systems out there. They're already shipping the code

558
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,760
We're not the first ones to do this, huh? And sco saying yeah, but you did that on purpose

559
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,320
Just so you could make that claim

560
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,480
And that's why we're still coming after you after all of these years

561
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,640
They're like, okay, well the judge can be right about all that stuff, but you still did a double dog trick

562
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,160
Back in 2001

563
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Do we know if uh any of this any of this code still exists in its original form in the kernel

564
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,040
I would be curious. Well, no, no

565
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,360
There was like a serious like come to hasus moment where they went through and like cleaned out anything that might have been left

566
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,040
Who knows maybe that might have been some of the momentum behind system d2

567
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,240
The whole thing though is is like this zombie threat against linux

568
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,560
That is just sort of like it's one of those zombies that comes up at you, but doesn't have any teeth now

569
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,760
So it's just sort of gummy at your neck. It's not actually I don't know

570
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,600
It's actually but you're like, oh, it's a new accessory. Come on take with you. Just go just go zombie go terrible

571
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,720
Yeah

572
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,520
It's the zombies go and it's back zombies go is back

573
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,040
And they're saying that ibm double dog tricked them years ago by doing a sham release of an os

574
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,600
That way they could then do another release of another os that had their code in it that then ended up in ganu slash linux

575
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
Which was the original sin?

576
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,840
Everybody follow that good. So I want to talk a little bit about

577
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,960
our

578
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:22,320
Guests will cook is the ubuntu desktop manager and mr. Didrocks is I would say probably most publicly famous for his?

579
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,640
artfuls

580
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,320
Transition to gnome post he did 16 blog posts, which I will have linked in the show notes

581
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,480
I'll have at least the 16 and it was he was ubuntu gnome shell in artful

582
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,240
Every single sort of major decision was documented and we covered

583
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,120
Some of these in the show probably a dozen not that half a I don't know five of them

584
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,680
But there were some big moments we covered in the show

585
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:52,720
And we were currently going back to them and I really liked these posts because uh, there was something that microsoft did during

586
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:59,440
I don't when's the last time I complimented microsoft everybody microsoft did something really smart during the release cycle of windows 7

587
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,080
I wonder if you guys remember remember. She's sorry remember this

588
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:07,120
there was this like a insider windows development blog where they

589
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,160
documented every major decision towards the development of windows 7 and

590
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,000
Including like some big changes that would impact enterprise deployments and end users and gamers and they did this long

591
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,920
complicated technical series and even though I wasn't a windows user

592
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,240
I loved reading it because I really got an insight in the development of windows 7

593
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,280
And I think it really got the whole damn windows community for what it was excited about this release

594
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,800
And I still to this day believe was one of the things that contributed to its success windows 7 its success

595
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,960
In the enterprise because sys admins like me were reading that and we knew what was coming group policy wise

596
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,480
We knew it was coming with the smb signing. We knew what was changing with how the shares enacted all this stuff

597
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,600
Really kind of was just explained to us and it made it an easy adoption and I feel like to a degree

598
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:01,360
That's what didrocks post did for ubuntu 1710 in this transition from unity 7 to gnome and their idea to do with their

599
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:06,400
Their reasoning for their doc and how they did it the gnome mode. So I talked with didrocks about some of this

600
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,320
And uh, I think it's great and we get a great anecdote for him

601
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,000
And then after that i'll bring on will he he had to join us separately

602
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,640
They were going to come on together, but will got stuck at the office

603
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,440
And so after I wrapped up with didrocks will was getting home

604
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,880
So then will and I chatted for a bit

605
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,400
So we got two separate interviews that we're going to play and wills is really great because as the ubuntu desktop manager

606
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,800
He's in a position to answer some, you know

607
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,440
Rather poignant questions. And so I asked them and so i'm really looking forward to playing that for you guys as well

608
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,280
So let's take a moment

609
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,200
And let's thank digital ocean digital ocean is a sponsor right here on the unplugged program and they've rolled out so much great stuff

610
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,560
So I guess hacktober has wrapped up now as people are listening to this

611
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,640
Lots of good code went to open source

612
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,080
If you if you want to just go look at some of the projects that digital ocean

613
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,760
Helped code roll into go look at the hacktober fest page

614
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,160
They also provide a lot of back-end infrastructure for a lot of our favorite open source projects

615
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,760
They really do they do sort of quietly every now and then some of the projects might put like a logo on the page

616
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,320
Or something, uh digital ocean is just a great way to spin up really fast really powerful infrastructure in less than 55 seconds

617
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:16,100
And the pricing is just phenomenal. And if you use our promo code, you'll get a ten dollar credit. So go to digital ocean.com

618
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,120
Create the account and then use our promo code do unplugged one word

619
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,720
Put it all together do unplugged and that'll give you a ten dollar credit

620
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,400
My favorite rig is the one I use for my remote desktop system is three cents an hour

621
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:36,240
So that's just amazing and then I've attached 100 gigabytes of block storage which I use to hold what I call my work volume

622
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,880
Which is all the big like clips and stuff. I'm working on for work and uh, I i've

623
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,600
I've been really really impressed with how well that's worked because obviously these things aren't like built to be desktop systems

624
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,920
But hell if it's not super fast because everything's ssd. Oh, yeah, they got crazy great internet connection

625
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,120
Crazy great internet. So I always have the that transit man

626
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,880
I have the best doing like always when I'm wrote in I always know that the digital ocean

627
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,240
Droplet has the best possible connection and that really makes a difference for that

628
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,680
Um, the object storage is great for generating links to download stuff

629
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,480
Of course, I could I can only scratch the surface there and and all of it really kind of comes together with a dashboard

630
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,720
That's so great. I say it's a dashboard for days. It's you can you can choose from ubuntu freebsd fedora debian

631
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,720
Um centos and they have uh core os in there as well. You can choose data centers all over the world

632
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:29,360
Work with teams if you want and if you've never ever installed a server before it's easy

633
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,520
And if you've installed servers for the last 15 years

634
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,640
You're gonna love how they've managed to strike that balance and it's still easy

635
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,680
Like the thing that makes me smile every damn time I do it is the dns management in digital ocean

636
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,480
It's just or or actually really what really is tops is the ssh ssh key management. Oh, yeah

637
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,240
Oh, man, nobody doesn't like that. Nobody doesn't like that. And they're also uh rolling out their new spaces product

638
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,360
They're offering a couple of months for free right now and they have a great

639
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,360
Write up on what the hell object storage is how it works why you might want to use spaces

640
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,660
And how it could probably make your website faster to digital ocean.com

641
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,960
And then just use our promo code do unplugged one word you get a ten dollar credit

642
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,200
And you support the show and we much we much much appreciate it. Um, so there was a post recently

643
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,120
Talking about the canonical goals for 1804, which i'll have linked in the show notes

644
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,560
But we're going to get into that a little bit. Let's let's start with. Uh, mr

645
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,880
Didrocks, uh, I assume when I started talking to because he wrote all the blog posts that of course

646
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,320
He must be the man with the master plan. There was no even master plan

647
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,320
Yeah, actually in my conversation with him

648
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:38,160
It turns out that they weren't even really quite sure what they were going to do up until the point. They went to guadec

649
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,480
Like how far in are we going to go? Like how many changes are we going to make?

650
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,200
They knew they had some data like the they'd surveyed users and everybody wanted to dock

651
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,600
Everybody wanted thunderbird and firefox. So they had like an idea of what the users expected

652
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,080
But there was a moment

653
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,400
That we talked about on the show is one of the times we covered with this blog post where things really clicked for them

654
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,000
And that was they went to go to guadec. They they build up some contacts

655
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:08,320
But didrocks ends up having a conversation with a friend of his they just spitballing and and the guy goes hey, you know

656
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,040
There's this there's this gnome shell mode thing and you guys could implement all your modifications in this mode

657
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:18,480
And then people could just choose between them and that was sort of like the pivotal moment where I think development

658
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,640
For 1710 kicked up and he shares all insights here. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's all based like we didn't, you know change anything in the core

659
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,760
You know like gnome shell, uh idea about theming or about, you know, adding extension

660
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:36,960
Like for the for the way we implement our session like adding the dock what you don't have by default on the gnome one

661
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,040
Uh, it's using what we call a gnome shell, uh mode

662
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,800
And so as part of the mode you can say this is the css. So this is a theme basically

663
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,200
This uh, those are the default extensions that we want to enable. Um,

664
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:58,560
And basically it was even you know, like based on a conversation with some friends, uh in the gnome community

665
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,040
Who told us oh you should do it that way

666
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:07,440
Yeah, that seems like a significant decision point for this entire project. Like it seems like when when the decision was made to implement

667
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,760
A gnome mode a session

668
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,840
Uh, it sort of was like a turning point in a way like how this was all going to be done. Is that true?

669
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:18,480
Yeah, exactly. Like, uh, yeah, so it was a little bit before even we decided

670
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,160
You know what we are going to do it was in july and I was just you know

671
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,520
Doing my daily exercise with a friend who is working on gnome and flat back

672
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,480
So we can see that we don't hate each other

673
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:35,120
And uh, and basically we just you know, like discuss about how how well in case you know, we are going to ship a doc

674
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,520
Or you know, what do you think because we are talking about tech, you know every time and say oh, you know

675
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,520
That there is this mode thing. Uh,

676
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:47,520
And this is how gnome classic is implemented and maybe you can look at you know

677
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,400
This and see if it works for you. And yeah, it did work. It did work even, you know

678
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,240
Way better than I was expecting

679
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:01,680
We we only have two or three distro patch in gnome shell changing the behavior like the alt-tab one that I explained on my blog

680
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,580
And two or three things on the sound notifications

681
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:12,320
But we made that depending on the session. So it means that if you are in the ubuntu session, it has this behavior

682
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,560
If you are on another session, it has a default upstream behavior

683
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:21,040
So the conversation meanders a bit and I get to 1804 with him and

684
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,280
There's a clear message from both will and didrocks here and it's the 1804

685
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,840
They really want it to be a rock. And so it's about polishing. So practically speaking

686
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,920
How do you go from that statement to actually making it happen?

687
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,360
And so didrocks says well, we're really going to have our qa

688
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,360
Focus on banging on gnome 3 the way we used to bang on unity 7. We're regearing our qa department now for gnome 3

689
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,360
We want as well with our qa team

690
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,680
To bring back, you know, the kind of quality expertise that we have

691
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,960
with unity in particular like

692
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,760
Running a lot of integration tests

693
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,280
So that each new uploads, you know are very work-solid

694
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,640
And so that we don't have to stress, you know as much as we did for 1710

695
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,800
They have a lot of automated testing

696
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,440
I'll be interesting to see if they can apply that to gnome, you know

697
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,720
Because then gnome could start seeing a bunch of great bugs and they can apply that to gnome

698
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,680
You know because then gnome could start seeing a bunch of great bug fixes

699
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,240
I was looking on the community page where will cook's starting to post our weekly roundup

700
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,120
They're working already practically on quite a bit of stuff. This made me think, you know, we were talking earlier about

701
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,160
Elementary and unity that there's something you know

702
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,520
Not to say that that like gnome or plasma don't have releases or anything like that

703
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,880
But there's something a little different when it's a distribution release, you know

704
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,160
There's a certain amount of like they understand that this is going to be the gateway

705
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,240
It's not just that it's to the whole experience and if they're going to get adopted or not

706
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,960
And so maybe there's a little bit different of an attitude and that's going to go up. Yeah interesting

707
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,080
Uh, so I got this anecdote from dinrocks

708
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,880
I really appreciate him sharing with us because I love this kind of stuff because it's nothing that's been posted on a blog or twitter

709
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:03,360
And um, it's kind of a significant development that came up 24 hours before the 1710 release

710
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:10,400
But the day before the release we found you know for first one guy telling oh, I don't have any more ui

711
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:17,120
Okay, and then we saw a second person, you know complaining as well. Yeah, they had ati cards

712
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,840
A third one a fourth one having nvidia cards and we started, you know, like to say oh

713
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,560
There is really something like a lot of people complaining no gnome shell crash

714
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,640
You know like before they had a ui and on that day, you know the update broke

715
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,880
and

716
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:42,560
Thanks to the very awesome french community. Uh, i'm i'm looking a lot on you know, the french forum being very involved with that community

717
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,440
And over the forum, we were debugging that

718
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:51,680
And I was asking, you know, uh, one of the impacting persons to revert, you know a lot of packages

719
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,720
And it was 24 hours before the release so you can imagine, you know the level of stress

720
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:03,620
Wow, uh and we found that it was the gnome shell update from 3.26.1

721
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,080
So from 3.26.0 to 3.26.1

722
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,800
This issue started to appear

723
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:18,400
So looking at you know all the commits and we saw that new features entered gnome and we saw that this

724
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,440
You know, oh potentially those commits are going to break

725
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:29,200
So preparing special packages, you know trying to revert some commits and asking over the forum to the guy, you know

726
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,800
To test it and the guy even was working and he went back home just to test this

727
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,040
So it's really awesome, you know dedication

728
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,600
Yeah, like I I can't thank you enough

729
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,800
And and once we found, you know the commits we were able at least, you know to ping upstream and they fix it, you know

730
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,800
very very, you know

731
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,760
Uh quickly, uh seeing what the issue, you know started to be but basically, you know

732
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,840
It's a lot of stress and and we just had a respin, you know on the day of the release

733
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,400
So people telling all this, you know, the isos are ready for a week already and you can download that it should be the final

734
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,240
No, it's not

735
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:13,280
Those are not final isos. So to this take this anecdote in for a moment, uh, 24 hours before the 1710 release

736
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,340
gnome

737
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:19,200
3.26.1 comes out and gnome 3.26.1

738
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:25,280
for some users starts breaking the graphical environment and this is the this is the

739
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:32,240
So they really gnome 3.26.1 didn't come out 24 hours release but 24 hours before release. They realized this problem has developed

740
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,720
Right. They've already got it on their iso, right?

741
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:40,640
So they've already got gnome 3.26.1 on the iso and they realized 24 hours before release shit. This is starting to wow

742
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,520
And it was thanks to a french community forum member

743
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,680
That didrocks was chatting with via the forum not a canonical employee

744
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:55,840
But this forum member who left his job and went home to help debug the problem

745
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,960
That they managed to find the issue

746
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,000
Get a fix written get the patch upstream to gnome gnome

747
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:11,300
Adopted the fix and they got that fix then repackaged up and pushed back down to 1710 in that day

748
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:15,060
So not only is it fixed but it was like fixed the right way and upstream. Yeah. Wow

749
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:20,020
I just couldn't even believe that when I heard that that's like the best because that forum member was willing to go home for the day

750
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:26,900
This is like a open source success story on steroids. I feel like canonical should like call that guy's

751
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,620
Office and give him like a doctor's note or something

752
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:34,020
Well, he's yeah, I mean I I say thanks to whoever that individual was

753
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:40,820
Yeah, I mean that really helps and it's it really does also show you in a weird weird like real way

754
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,140
How much of a community effort it still is at the end of the day?

755
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:48,660
You can talk about mark shuttleworth and canonical and and you can talk about the employees at canonical

756
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:53,540
But at the end of the day, thanks to a forum member in a french linux community. I just can't even believe it

757
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:55,060
It's it's just sort of

758
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:00,340
Uh, but it's so great because it is having worked in project releases like that the exact kind of thing that happens

759
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,340
It's those real human stories. Um

760
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:08,980
So I also asked him if he's going to continue to blog during the 1804 cycle because like I said, I've really enjoyed them

761
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:12,580
And he says he is he says that he'll be continuing to post updates

762
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:17,780
Um, and uh, he doesn't expect there'll be as many because there's really not going to be as many radical changes

763
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:23,540
It's going to be more like bug fixes and stuff. You know, they're trying to make 1804 solid not uh, not totally new but

764
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,540
um both

765
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:31,460
When I talked to will and didrocks, I got I got I got a sense that there's there is a um

766
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,940
Willingness to implement new features in 1804. So there could be new stuff that ends up showing up in 1804

767
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:40,020
Even though right now they're all talking bug fixes

768
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,100
uh, so

769
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:45,780
Now I want to talk I want to chat with will it's a we have these are a bit longer

770
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,380
Um, and um, I will uh, you know what? Let's do this. Let's take a moment

771
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:53,940
We'll uh, we'll we'll say we'll thank ting and then we'll get to will because uh will was a we don't want any

772
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:59,460
Chat and yeah, I just want to do the whole thing. So go go over to linux.ting.com. Yeah, that's right

773
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:04,020
Linux.ting.com you go there and you sign up for a smarter way to do mobile. It's it's it's

774
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,580
It's how they'd have to do it to be honest

775
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:11,300
If they had to compete today if the big duopoly's had to compete today, uh, it's how they'd have to do it

776
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,620
It's you just pay for what you use you don't prepay

777
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:18,260
for like 300 minutes and 300 text messages and a gigabyte of data or

778
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:21,720
Or a thousand, you know, you don't you don't just guess how much you're going to use

779
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,240
You just pay for what you do use. It's 23 for the average

780
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,240
Ting bill per line 23 bucks you pay for what you use

781
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:32,360
It's six dollars a month for each line if you want 10 lines at six dollars

782
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,000
Now I stop and think about that if you're a small business or even a kind of a moderately large family

783
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,120
Who else has those prices six dollars a line and then you pay for what you use? That's

784
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,040
I mean that's super competitive for a small business. It's a game changer

785
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:52,360
It lets us it lets us have mobility and coverage in a way that would cost us an inconceivable amount of money

786
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:59,000
Otherwise you go to linux.ting.com and you get 25 in service credit if you bring a gsm or a cdma device

787
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:04,440
Yeah, they support both just check their byod page or if you want to buy a phone, they'll take 25 off

788
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:11,000
They have great devices the whole range from budget phones flip phones sim cards only to uh, you know

789
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,600
The latest and greatest cadillacs and they really are just super simple to work with

790
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:18,520
It's uh, in fact, I really like their new strategy when when the beard over there was at twitch con

791
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,040
As uh, sort of like a twitch con swag item. They were handing out ting sim cards

792
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,520
And I think that just sort of perfectly encapsulates ting

793
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,560
It's like you just get the sim card and then when you need it you put it in something

794
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,880
And then uh, they'll let you use their mobile network, however you want and you just pay for what you do use

795
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,540
It's a really great way to do it. You go to linux.ting.com

796
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:43,160
It's it's my mobile service provider now for over two years linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring

797
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,160
linux unplugged

798
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:50,700
Yeah, so will is the ubuntu desktop manager and he just recently restarted the desktop weekly newsletter

799
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:56,300
Over at community.ubuntu.com where they covered some of the upstream fixes that they've been working with

800
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,620
And he has all kinds of things to talk about

801
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:02,780
I've been wanting to chat with will for a long time and he and I had a had a good chance to sort of

802
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,420
Chat on and off at the ubuntu rally

803
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:09,660
But I wanted to get him on the show because he's one of those guys where he has been around at canonical

804
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:14,300
And been following ubuntu well since forever and i've been using ubuntu for oh, I don't know

805
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,820
Well since the beginning stewart langridge of all people put me onto it

806
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:22,380
Um, I was playing around with debbie and and he said oh you should try this ubuntu thing. It's a whole lot less bother

807
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:28,380
And yeah, he's got like 11 year old uh an account over their launchpad account or something like that

808
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:29,820
and uh

809
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,500
He's now the guy that sort of manages the whole damn ubuntu desktop effort

810
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:37,980
And so I wanted to ask him sort of a question that's been kicking around in my mind

811
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:44,620
And that is did they just sort of screw the pooch by dropping unity because it was essentially theirs

812
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:49,340
Nobody upstream could tell them no they had a certain amount of difference

813
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:55,100
That was that made them stand out because they had this unique product and gave them certain leverage to implement

814
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:59,420
Goals that the company might have so if you want to integrate snap packs throughout the whole damn thing

815
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:03,020
Nobody would stop them from doing it to unity. So I asked will I said will

816
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:08,540
Is are you concerned that ubuntu has lost some of its leverage by dropping unity and switching to gnome?

817
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:11,020
I'm not concerned about it. Uh, I mean

818
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:16,140
there will need to be uh, these discussions about I don't know some of the

819
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:21,420
the usability that we think is suboptimal, uh, but upstream

820
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,060
Have a very clear vision about the way that they want to do it

821
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:28,300
So, you know, we need to we need to have those discussions in the open with upstream

822
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:31,020
And you know, we need evidence to back this up

823
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:35,500
Um, we do have a certain amount of research that was done in the unity seven days

824
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:37,740
Uh, and indeed the unity eight days to say, you know

825
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:44,700
This works and this doesn't so we can make all of that research available to to gnome designers and the gnome community and say

826
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:49,020
We think this is a good idea and here's why we think it's a good idea. Let's talk about it

827
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:50,620
Um, and you know

828
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:56,860
We're coming with with evidence showing one way or the other if it is ultimately against the the wishes of upstream then you know

829
01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:01,180
That's that's the way we have to go because we are now working upstream

830
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:09,020
He actually reiterated that point later on he later on said yeah, if they do something that we're not on board with

831
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:16,300
Then uh, we'll just defer to their wisdom. We believe in this case and that's uh, that's a fascinating statement

832
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:20,460
Essentially, they're planning not to fight the current. That's a big that's a big move decision

833
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:25,820
Uh direction for you know a company to go that's a lot of trust in their upstream

834
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:31,420
And I also asked him kind of related. I said well, how have some of the hardware vendors responded to this?

835
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:38,460
You know what? I mean? And uh, his answer was essentially well for the most case they're shipping ltss, but

836
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:41,580
Uh for the second thing, uh in a way for them

837
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:46,060
It's it's less risk because now canonical is not solely responsible for the desktop product

838
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,940
And so the oems in a way

839
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,340
Uh don't really have that worry that it's canonical

840
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:55,820
You're not gonna get off the pot and uh ship something new or or we've got to start now. It's

841
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:00,380
They're they're not solely responsible for it defers the risk a bit for the oems in the long run

842
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:06,540
Was sort of his argument now I had I had a question that sort of been percolating from our discord chat room discord.me

843
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:14,300
Jupiter colony. We have a linux unplugged chat room over there linux unplugs chat room a reason why channel I guess they call it

844
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:18,540
Here's why I think this is a good idea you guys i'm mentioning this because if you're ever watching the video version

845
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:22,780
And you see a link go by or if you're listening and you want to hear what the discord room's response was

846
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:25,980
Now that we're breaking linux, we're gonna break all the shows off into their own channels

847
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:30,060
There's not going to be a ton of activity between this episode and the next one

848
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,900
So if you're here if you're listening to this in playback either in video or audio

849
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:39,500
You can go into that linux unplugged channel and see what the discord conversation was because there's not really going to be much else in there

850
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,700
And including links if you see something go by

851
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:47,340
So discord.me slash Jupiter colony and then linux unplugged as a channel for this show

852
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:53,340
And so one of the questions that's been coming through our discord a lot has been are they going to replace all the devs with uh,

853
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:55,580
with with snaps, um

854
01:03:55,580 --> 01:04:02,480
Will said recently that they were are considering replacing the leaf quote-unquote applications with snaps in 1804

855
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,620
So, uh, I asked him, you know, what is a leaf application to deal with that?

856
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,900
And what role are snaps going to play in uh, 1804?

857
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:15,100
So we have the dev archive and that is not going to go away because there are flavors that are using it

858
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:18,140
Uh, a lot of the snaps are built on from from those devs

859
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:21,500
Um in that source, so, you know that it's not going to go anywhere

860
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:26,060
But we do want the to have the ability to to push out new and updated

861
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:33,180
Applications much quicker to our end users. We're not going to be a rolling release. You know, that's that's not going to happen

862
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:39,500
So the snaps give us the the freedom to push out updates quickly and it gives us the whole

863
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:45,340
Um ability to have various tracks and various channels so we can put something into testing

864
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:50,220
And people can very easily switch over test it and then switch back again if it doesn't work

865
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:53,020
so it gives us an element of freedom to

866
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:55,740
to move more quickly on a very

867
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,180
solid foundation of 1804 that the underlying os can

868
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,980
Can stay the same and all of the um, you know

869
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:07,260
The processes that we go through to make sure that only good quality packages get into that release. Um,

870
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:12,620
I see. So yeah the idea with snaps and the leaf applications. These are the ones sort of uh, the

871
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:18,860
The very tip of the tree if you like, um, these are going to be user applications, which are

872
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,500
perhaps less

873
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:27,500
Entwined in the in the underlying os so the likes of the gnome apps they depend on the gnome libraries

874
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:31,900
But they don't necessarily need to sort of dig into deep into the file system

875
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:38,540
Yeah, and so it seems like if it's a user space application that uh isn't necessarily overly integrated with the overall os

876
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:42,060
It could be a candidate to be snappified and then

877
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:47,100
Sort of like how android delivers stuff through the play store in a way. This is a rough equivalent

878
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,920
Uh canonical could deliver updates to applications

879
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,620
While not altering the lts base

880
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:57,100
Seems like a I mean it seems like a pretty good goal and that would be a good way to test it

881
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:00,700
But I my comment back to will was essentially that's huge

882
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:08,060
I mean, that's a huge objective for canonical that obviously makes snaps pretty critical to the future of the desktop into canonical

883
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,400
Um, aren't you a bit worried that this is going to frustrate?

884
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:16,460
Your upstream developers gnome that are creating your desktop now

885
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:22,460
Like you are now in a very precarious situation where the ubuntu distribution is pretty much married to gnome

886
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:28,700
And they're all in on flat pack and you're you guys are creating a competitor that could ruffle some feathers

887
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:33,340
Are you concerned about that? Yeah, I mean that that is definitely a very real risk

888
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,220
And we do need to be careful the way that we we navigate that

889
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:37,420
um

890
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:44,300
But ultimately, you know, we're not we're not blocking flat pack from being developed and distributing their apps in that way

891
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:49,740
Um, you know, you can get all the game apps as flat packs and you can get them all as snaps

892
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:52,060
So, you know, there should be a problem here

893
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:57,260
I thought that was a decent answer really because that's true at the end of the day. They're both

894
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:00,860
uh, essentially first class citizens on the ubuntu desktop

895
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,060
So you could if you want to run you want to flat pack it you can flat pack it

896
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:10,060
And uh, let let the market decide is essentially their approach there fair enough fair enough

897
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:14,700
So there's been some rumors go on afoot that unity 7 is not quite dead yet

898
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,180
That in fact, there may be a small

899
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,420
But not not insignificant effort

900
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:26,320
To continue unity 7 and to make it shippable for 1804

901
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:32,540
Yeah, and I want to know what the heck's going on here. Is this a canonical driven effort?

902
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,420
Is this a community driven ever? What is the story here?

903
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:42,540
A community driven thing. Uh, I mean we're obviously very welcome of people that want to step up and help maintain that

904
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:44,860
Uh during the 1710 cycle

905
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:49,580
We did take an interest in making sure that unity 7 still worked and and you know

906
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:51,580
wasn't completely broken and that

907
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:54,860
Is a is a statement that we will stand by in 1804

908
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:59,020
We will make sure that it doesn't just break horrifically and and then suddenly it is unusable

909
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:05,580
Um, what we won't be able to do is is any sort of significant feature development. It's in it's on 1604

910
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:09,580
So things like security updates and critical crashes these sort of kind of things

911
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:15,580
We are still on the hook to to make sure that those updates happen. So, you know if we're if we're in there

912
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:19,180
Um working on the code base anyway to to fix up things then

913
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:20,620
um

914
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:23,900
You know the the that will benefit 1804 users as well

915
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:29,180
You know if we upload I don't know let's say a new version of um xorg and suddenly it breaks

916
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:32,780
Um unity 7 the more people that are out there testing it the sooner

917
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,420
We know then the easier it will be to fix that or you know

918
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:40,460
Rather than six months later try and try and find what commit it was that that broke it in the first place

919
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:44,620
So yeah, i'm very i'm very keen to see people get involved in that

920
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:49,740
Yeah, there's a community organizing effort over on the community page and i'll have a link to that in the show notes

921
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:55,900
It's it's not insane actually because they already have to support it as you heard will say for 1604

922
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:00,140
so that the the security back porting bug fixing is

923
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:03,820
Not maybe not so much bug fixing unless it's something like a regression

924
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:07,740
Uh is still happening for 1604 because they have to support that for years

925
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:12,460
So why not also then make it available for 180 if that works being done totally, you know

926
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:16,220
like microsoft like makes security patches for xp but then

927
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,260
Hold on to them unless you pay

928
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:24,620
Yeah, it's essentially the opposite of that and um, I I kind of I kind of think it works great too because

929
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:26,060
Comp is itself

930
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:29,980
We've had wimpy talking to us a little bit about how compass itself is also still being maintained

931
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:35,740
And in in quote unquote not active development, but not also neglected. It's like still being worked on

932
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:37,740
It's still a product that gets tested and

933
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:43,660
It's getting better still. Um, so you have basically a vintage comp is compositor

934
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:51,020
Which has been pretty well worked out now over the years by a very intelligent very talented developer who uh, just blows me away

935
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:57,100
some of the some of the um video acceleration stuff I think is due to the compass the guy that also maintains compass and um,

936
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,500
Just incredibly talented individual

937
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,500
And so I really I guess I have a lot of I now that I now I know who he is

938
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:06,220
And i've met him. I have some faith in uh,

939
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:12,620
Uh that product and it seems like it's obvious that if unity is going to be maintained for 1604 that it's

940
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:14,940
It's probably a safe bet for 1804

941
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:17,980
And it's pretty damn reliable and it works pretty damn well

942
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:22,940
And so to me it was that that conversation there after I walked away i'm like why the hell don't I just use that?

943
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:26,380
Like I didn't switch away from ubuntu because of unity. I switched away because of arch

944
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:29,820
And uh, if I hadn't switched away, I would have still been using unity

945
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:33,500
So why not and it's going to be maintained for it for I mean

946
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,860
The l that 1804 is going to be maintained for five years. Yeah, totally

947
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:41,660
That's a ton of long time and I could switch back to gnome or plasma at any moment

948
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:43,900
And I have a ton of runway to let them work it out

949
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:46,780
That is where it's nice to be on a monkey right? Like not only do you get unity?

950
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:51,500
But yeah, you can switch to know just about anytime you want. I know you can get unity on arch

951
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:57,500
I tried I tried it's just it's not the same. Um, so there's there's there's sort of a bigger story here

952
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:02,940
And that is if you're I I hear this from the audience too if you're like, I I never really develop anything

953
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:06,540
I I don't do any translations. I I don't even submit bugs

954
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:08,140
uh

955
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:11,340
But I feel like I should do something and uh, maybe this is your time

956
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:16,220
Maybe this is your time 1710 is not bad to kick the tires even load it up in a vm as will says

957
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:20,700
And uh help file bugs if everybody could spend, you know an hour

958
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:28,220
In a vm testing something in 1710 and just log a bug report for everything they find then it means the 1804 is going to be

959
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:31,980
Just an excellent high quality solid reliable release

960
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:35,980
Um, we we can't do that on our own. We're you know, relatively small team

961
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:41,180
We can find the bump and fix the bugs that we know about so people can can tell us about these things

962
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:44,860
Then they will get fixed don't just hang out on um

963
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:48,140
comments on on forum posts and um

964
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:53,340
You know social media and that kind of thing moaning that something's broken. Please help us to to fix it

965
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:53,820
Yeah

966
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:59,180
And it's really not hard to file a bug for ubuntu and uh, it is sort of an opportunity to sort of contribute

967
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:03,340
Towards the next lts that could be more stable even if you're not a main daily ubuntu user

968
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,860
It's a nice way to help out open source and the gnome project and maybe wayland

969
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:11,180
Uh, so check that out. We'll have links to ways to help out and the community stuff in the page

970
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:17,100
It really seems to be in the show notes. It really seems to be their focus is making 1804 great again. Oh, I did it

971
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,340
Oh god, sorry. I'm sorry

972
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:23,740
Anyways, I really appreciate both didrocks and will coming on the show. It was great to chat with them

973
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:28,780
Yeah, that's great. And it was it was nice to sort of mark. Um a really um, I mean

974
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:34,060
Damn, uh, uh, what do you call it? Uh, hercules effort. What is that herculean? Thank you

975
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:37,500
That really was what seemed like 1710 was especially when you consider

976
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:41,820
They started out they didn't quite know going into it how far they were going to go

977
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:47,580
Like where was the line? Where do we draw the line from? This is unity now to stock gnome 3

978
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:53,660
They didn't know where that line was. They didn't know what their doc solution was. They they ended with a

979
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:58,940
A great anecdote where a community member saves the day by helping troubleshoot

980
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:02,780
And then upstream kicks ass by cooperating in record speed. Wow

981
01:13:03,180 --> 01:13:08,300
Did you see this week that the gnome project had a little gnome loves, uh, ubuntu on their front page

982
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:12,620
I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if it's still up there, but they were they were welcoming 1710 users

983
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:15,020
That was pretty I did not expect to see that

984
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:19,420
Didn't I don't know if it's still up there or not, but oh it is still up there. Look at that

985
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:23,520
Yeah ubuntu plus gnome equals love. Oh at gnome.org

986
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:28,300
How far we have come well what happened to the big red hat conspiracy

987
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:33,900
Anyways, it's great to see it and um now i'm all now I now i'm

988
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:39,260
Now i'm some sort of unity hipster and I I hate it. I hate it because I know people are going to give me shit

989
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:43,740
Um, but i'm all in and i'll link you if you're if you are too if you want to stay here

990
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:50,460
Uh, you know what unity 7 is the new xfce i'm calling it right now. And I also am going to predict here on this show

991
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:51,800
episode

992
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:58,640
221 that there will be a unity 7 respin of at least 1804 if not 1710 eventually

993
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:02,720
That if this takes off and you even get a few people contributing

994
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:06,880
And the fact that canonical employees are going to be contributing as part of their maintenance of 1604

995
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:11,580
Why wouldn't you create a respin? Everybody loves making a respin. Yeah, totally

996
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:18,380
Maybe and maybe even it'll have first class support someday call it pop. Oh, no, i'm kidding. Um, oh, oh ouch

997
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:23,260
But I really think somebody could come up with something like this like a respin and uh, it might have some love

998
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:27,340
Yeah, maybe they're uh, maybe unity 7 refugees will end up on unity

999
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:32,700
We should name it. That would be really if anybody in the room anybody in the room good coming up with names

1000
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,980
Because that'd be a really good one. Hello. Mr. Wimper. It's nice to see you pop in

1001
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:40,700
Hello, i'm good at names. What do you think if somebody i'm calling a prediction that somebody

1002
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:44,540
At least with 1804 maybe during 1710 cycle

1003
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:49,340
But I think with 1804 is going to release a unity respin of ubuntu unity 7

1004
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:52,060
Let's call it unity 8

1005
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,340
like ate or like what like

1006
01:14:55,980 --> 01:15:01,420
No unity. No unity 10 unity 10, dude. You gotta go. What do you think wimpy? What are they gonna call that distro?

1007
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:03,420
It's a unity 7 ubuntu

1008
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:11,740
Well, I mean it's funny you should mention this because i've just sort of pitched in on their thread on the ubuntu community

1009
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:13,180
hub to say

1010
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:17,740
If they're seeking to make a there are a group of people that are gearing up to do this

1011
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:21,900
You know if they're seeking to make an official flavor, I will help guide them through that process

1012
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:27,500
And i've been thinking about names. I've not mentioned this to anybody but they could go for

1013
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:34,460
For the ubuntu unity remix whilst they're, you know working through that process and then it would become ubuntu unity

1014
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:37,260
But I thought to myself I quite like ubuntu united

1015
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,180
That's good, too

1016
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:45,100
I think uh, well, I think it's going to be ubuntu unity probably just for clarity clarity. I bet I bet you

1017
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:51,420
Yeah, so the new naming scheme is sort of ubuntu and you know desktop environment or application

1018
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:55,420
So, uh, my prediction is pretty on point then it would seem

1019
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:56,620
uh

1020
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:00,060
Wow, I would really I would really like it if they took you up on that offer

1021
01:16:00,140 --> 01:16:03,340
You have the bandwidth for that because uh, that's very generous. I don't know

1022
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,820
I just not to repeat myself in the show

1023
01:16:05,820 --> 01:16:08,860
But um i'm going all in on unity 7 on the studio machines

1024
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:10,940
And so i'm really i'm really glad to hear that

1025
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:16,220
We just played a clip from will where he said that they're gonna there's be some level of support into 1804

1026
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:18,460
Which really kind of sealed the deal for me?

1027
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:22,540
Yeah, and you know, I I contacted will earlier and said, you know, I was gonna

1028
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:28,220
Offer my assistance and i've found out that other people at canonical are already

1029
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:32,940
also offering their assistance to sort of coach and guide this group of

1030
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:34,620
um

1031
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:38,220
Uh would be distro maintainers to get them orientated

1032
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:42,620
So I think there's a good chance that this could happen because all the right people seem to be prepared to

1033
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:48,620
You know lend extend a hand to to help them get started. So it'd be great to see it's a genuinely good product

1034
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:53,820
Just it's it's a good product. Um, it's in the sense that you can appreciate that

1035
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:58,540
It's well thought out it performs. Well, it does its job and it stays the hell out of your way

1036
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:05,260
And then it does other things that I appreciate as somebody who gets impatient as it the there seems to be

1037
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:11,500
Uh, and I have not confirmed this but noah's told me a subtle transition in the animation speeds as you continue to use the desktop

1038
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,500
The animation speeds at a certain point speed up

1039
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,900
Once they figure okay, you've gotten the idea

1040
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:19,660
Yeah, that is some brilliance right there. That is some damn brilliance

1041
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:26,780
There's a lot of thought and design that's gone into unity. And the other thing is is that it is still current

1042
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:34,780
So, you know high dpi and all of those good things are all taken account for and when I when I wrote my email

1043
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:38,060
I introduced on my my post on the community hub

1044
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:44,540
I introduced myself for those those who weren't familiar and sort of basically said, you know, I have some experience in preserving a desktop

1045
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,540
For the users that love it

1046
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:50,620
And I did want to go on a bit further and and you know talk about that

1047
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:56,380
But I decided to keep things brief, but you know, I wanted to say, you know, unity 7 is a great project to

1048
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,460
Preserve because it's up to date right now

1049
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:04,940
there's only one thing I can think of that they might want to consider doing to

1050
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:12,780
um, you know bring unity 7 up to date with sort of contemporary stuff and that's to use lib input as opposed to the

1051
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:16,480
Synaptics driver and other than that, you know, it's pretty much there

1052
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:20,160
um, so yeah, it's a great project to to

1053
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,920
Build a new flavor around or it continue a flavor around

1054
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,840
I think it's going to happen and I hope it does because I hope so too

1055
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:35,360
Have you seen that there's some nice iso spins from a couple of projects on source forge? No, I didn't know

1056
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:42,400
That's a thing already. It's all yeah, so there's there's a 1710 abuntu unity iso and it's it's a proper job

1057
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:46,960
It's been really well done. So I believe would you be able to toss a link to that in the unplugged discord channel?

1058
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:52,080
A bit later. I will i'll have to go hunting and find it. Sure. I would love to see that that's fascinating

1059
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:56,000
That's happening fast. Wow. Yeah, we should dig out the old um

1060
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,240
the old docs that the design team did because they did some

1061
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:08,560
They had a whole lot of extra features that were planned for unity, but never got done for various reasons like resourcing mostly

1062
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,560
but there were

1063
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:16,160
Some really nice stuff that they came up with that. We just never got around to doing. Hello. Maybe they could um, hello

1064
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,400
Use inspiration. Yeah, uh, yeah

1065
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:24,320
Will was talking too about maybe sharing some of the unity 7 usability research with uh with the gnome group, too

1066
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,520
Um, cool

1067
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:26,160
I uh

1068
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:30,160
I'm really glad you guys are here because this is going to be the episode where I get flamed for being a unity 7

1069
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:34,880
Hipster for like this i'm going to get labeled after this. So i'm glad you guys are here as a support group for me because

1070
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:40,320
Uh, well, it's it's good that you're in at the ground level chris. Yeah. Yeah, I am apparently dude. I'm using it right now

1071
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,360
It's my main desktop. Me too. Me too

1072
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:48,640
Me too. I've reloaded five systems since last week's episode with ubuntu 1604

1073
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:51,180
1604 and unity 7

1074
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,760
And I put them all in landscape

1075
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,640
It's been going great

1076
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,640
I really like it. It's the it's so far i'm only i'm obviously only one week into it

1077
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,800
I don't know if unity gets to be called hipster anymore. I think it's I think you're a unity oldster chris

1078
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:12,160
Yeah, you know the uh, i'm a big proponent of cockpit as well. I think that's a great product for fedora. Uh, but um,

1079
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,240
The landscape product is nice because you got a couple of tiered options here

1080
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:20,000
You get yourself hosted which costs a little more but then you run the server yourself

1081
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:24,800
Or you can go with the service version, which is like five dollars a month or whatever and it does everything I need

1082
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:29,760
You know, I just go to I go to landscape page. I log in I get a quick overview of all the systems

1083
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,440
I mean

1084
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,120
That's that's it. Basically give it takes it from uh, kind of a mishmash

1085
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:39,280
Everything's sort of before we had solace. We had ubuntu we had two arches

1086
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,960
um

1087
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,960
We had a couple of ubuntu 1710s

1088
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:46,960
Uh, you know just kind of just a boy that sounds like madness

1089
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,240
Even even though like linux is the whole thing that we're doing right? Like what show is this?

1090
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:56,720
But like just that's that's a lot of administrative overhead for one studio for no real reason. Yeah, it's just sort of all over the place

1091
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,400
and um

1092
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,480
You know mostly was driven by application availability, right?

1093
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:05,200
Like a year ago, um, which is just not the same issue today. It's so nice

1094
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,960
Um, and so yeah, it was a great time to purge

1095
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,760
It takes time going through and resetting up all these systems

1096
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,320
There's so many little fiddly things you got to do and you have to be able to like

1097
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,760
It's not like you can leave it off at any one stage you need to get far enough that you can like

1098
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:19,520
Still do the next show that you have to do. Yeah, i'm gonna also say

1099
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:26,340
Since i'm just since i'm already all in I think the unity launcher is still superior to any other doc implementation

1100
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:31,620
That i've used first of all, it doesn't take a shit, which is nice a lot of a lot of linux docs out there do

1101
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:34,100
uh, but it it has

1102
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:39,620
Good progress indication, but I really like the wiggle bounce thing because that really is a nice subtle, but then it stops

1103
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:44,980
It's just it's just a solid and then you hold down the super key and you get like the numbered execution

1104
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:49,940
There's a there's oh, yeah, that is nice. There's just a crap ton of keyboard navigation possible in unity 7, which uh

1105
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:54,420
Makes it really quick for me to do it on air. So if I wanted to uh

1106
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,980
Uh launch spotify to play music like during the post show

1107
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:00,740
I hold down super and I super 8 and spotify launches

1108
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:04,020
And uh, then I hit fn play and it just starts playing

1109
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:07,780
And then I get playback control in a drop down menu that I can use from the other virtual desktop that i'm on

1110
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:15,140
Super right. That's great. It is. Um, there is many things about it that I I really appreciate the like control alt

1111
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:18,340
numpad to uh, kind of quick tile windows

1112
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:23,220
I use that all the time to work and also I do feel like speaking of that. I do feel like the uh,

1113
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:28,580
Uh the desktop the the virtual desktop whatever you want to call this this this this this

1114
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:33,300
This expose out or whatever you want to call it and then move windows around is is butter smooth

1115
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:36,260
It's the it's the smoothest the zoom in zoom out move around

1116
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:42,100
The way it works is butter smooth and then there's other things about this that I that gnome 3 has just gotten

1117
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:45,380
Um with the with the new 3.26 release

1118
01:22:46,580 --> 01:22:50,660
That unity 7 had the entire time like the fact that you can snap a window to the edge

1119
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:56,420
But then resize and drag it. Oh, yes, and yes, and I don't know what they're doing differently than other desktops. But um,

1120
01:22:57,620 --> 01:22:58,740
My windows

1121
01:22:58,740 --> 01:22:59,380
Just I don't know

1122
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,140
It's like things are fitting better

1123
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:06,360
Like I snap something and there's like still space for telegram to fit on the screen and telegrams fits proportionally

1124
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:10,980
And it's just it's just like it just it just works and I don't have to screw with it

1125
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:15,860
And it's all done beautifully and smooth and I should really stop now because i'm probably driving people crazy

1126
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:22,260
But I I haven't used unity regularly as my main driver for what how long did I go? Did I switch to arch?

1127
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:28,580
Uh three years now three four years. Yeah, and so I have not used I mean i've used it as an appliance

1128
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:29,860
We have a machine over here

1129
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:30,500
I poke at it

1130
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,540
I set software up

1131
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:36,820
But I don't sit down for a six hour work period and just use it right and that's where I had started having these

1132
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:38,820
Holy shit moments where i'm like, oh, yeah

1133
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:39,860
I

1134
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:41,220
And you know what? I started members like oh, yeah

1135
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:46,020
I used to I used to do a lot of work under unity 7 like this was the desktop I took to my clients

1136
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:50,420
On my system and I sat down and I used this one. This is the one I got all my work done

1137
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:54,500
This is the one where i'd work on dozens of servers at once like oh, yeah, that's right

1138
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:56,760
This is a super kick-ass productive desktop environment

1139
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,540
And it's smooth as hell

1140
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,460
So to be fair

1141
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:08,020
It's smooth as hell in 2017 with 2017 hardware when it first came out in like 2010

1142
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:10,020
It was

1143
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:17,060
It was when it first came out. It was built for netbooks. So right. Yeah, it was like really not not a competitive product

1144
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:19,620
But it got it really it really got there

1145
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:22,340
And you know, I took three years off from using it

1146
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,140
um

1147
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:28,740
When I kind of stopped using it was when the search stuff was all kind of like getting everybody all worked up about the ads

1148
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:33,860
and the results and all the amazon results and all that and how it was proxied or if it was hdbs and

1149
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:36,500
That whole thing was around the time

1150
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:42,660
I just sort of switched to gnome anyways, and I haven't really gone back since then for any significant amount of time

1151
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:46,820
And um, that stuff's all gone now. It's off by default. It's clean, you know, it's

1152
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:50,980
Not a problem. It feels like you could have played a richard stallman sample at that point

1153
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:54,740
I know you know what if my soundboard machine hadn't crashed earlier today. I would have that

1154
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:56,740
I think he's finishing our burgers from earlier

1155
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:03,140
We did have a little five guys earlier today and he does love those fries richard stallman loves those cajun fries

1156
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:09,540
I won't speak for him otherwise though. Yeah. Anyways, so I guess i've waxed poetically enough about a desktop

1157
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:13,700
That's eventually going to die and that nobody really wants to use anymore and has caused much political grief

1158
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:17,380
In the linux ecosystem. It sounds like something that people really love listening to so I should probably stop

1159
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:21,700
But uh, I would love to have you join us come over to jblive.tv next week

1160
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:25,220
This is the week that next week the next episode

1161
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:31,700
222 is the one where we where we here in the states make the daylight savings transition daylight savings. We're slow now

1162
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:37,060
Yeah, so we're a week behind wimpy and poppy and uh, we will catch up to them next week

1163
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:43,300
So check jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar if you're a live attendee remember now, we have that linux unplugged channel

1164
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:44,580
Yeah in discord

1165
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:49,620
So if there's a link that gets tossed in there during the show or somebody says something you can go back after the fact

1166
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:52,180
And look at it, but we'll generally try to put everything in the show notes, too

1167
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:56,440
So you don't even have to worry about it go to jupiter broadcasting.com and look for episode 222

1168
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:01,220
Something else I haven't mentioned in a little while is we have a telegram group for the community

1169
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:04,740
I think you can just go to jupiter broadcasting.com slash telegram. Will you double check that for me?

1170
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:07,140
You go there and it'll forward you to our telegram group

1171
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:09,140
So i've been mentioning discord a lot recently

1172
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:16,260
I should give a plug for that and then last but not least we have good old classic reddit linux unplugged dot

1173
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:21,540
Reddit yep, that works just perfectly jupiter broadcasting.com slash telegram. Thank you, sir

1174
01:26:21,620 --> 01:26:26,580

That feels like it's impressive. That's that's almost as good as star trek sexy

1186
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:12,820
Which is the domain I own and i'm the most proud of star trek. Wow. I ever launched a star trek show

1187
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:16,260
It'll be an easter egg. Does it just forward to jb for now? I don't

1188
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:22,420
I you damn it really should I don't think I am an idiot. I should do that. Maybe i'm just too busy podcasting

1189

I hope you join us for the next one

1190
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:27,780
After that, maybe i'll get to that star trek show one day in the meantime

1198
01:28:24,100 --> 01:28:26,100
So

1199
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:43,780
All right, let's see if we can't title the son of a gun

1200
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:50,660
Let's see if we can't title this. Mr. Chris. Yes, sir that uh, that gen 2 compiling you were doing. Oh shoot

1201
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:56,100
I forgot all about that. We ran out of time. Well, it also scrolled up your discord chat. So you're behind. Oh, you're right

1202
01:28:56,100 --> 01:29:00,340
It did you're right that gentoo. That's what I can't ever tell what's happening. That's what happened

1203
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:02,580
Damn, that's so the whole chat didn't move for the whole show

1204
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:08,500
Look at that because I was busy building gentoo i'm beginning to come to the conclusion that the gentoo challenge is still on

1205
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:13,940
But eight weeks later, you're still compiling the software that is so you've got something to talk about this week

1206
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:18,100
We've never done compiling that software legitimately. This is that is true for this week

1207
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:23,460
Every time we finish compiling this updates the things. Yeah new version the chromium comes out back at it. Damn it

1208
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:29,780
It's been hard to fit it in, you know, uh, uh, I I feel bad about the chat room because uh, I had tabbed off

1209
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:35,220
Yeah, you know, that's what should we interrupt you in case because you usually only

1210
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:41,940
No, it's not really great to have because it sort of breaks the flow of the show for me to do that

1211
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:45,060
So there's not a really great answer other than me just staying on top of it better

1212
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:50,180
Really the best answer is is to take advantage of obs and discord that can you know?

1213
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:54,420
Do some sort of api magic a little shake a dake and uh, so I can bring it up and do it

1214
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:59,540
Yeah, well, well, yeah, so we don't need to be window capturing really we could do it other means

1215
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:02,420
It's just you know, that's our old system and we just quickly switched

1216
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:05,460
Um, so what do you think guys? How do we name this bish?

1217
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:08,660
You can do bang suggest in either and I will check bang suggest in the irc

1218
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:11,700
We'll put it up on the titles page. Otherwise, i'll just search for bang suggest

1219
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:16,260
Um, and we're gonna have to get that fixed. Yeah, you know, we're just kind of waiting

1220
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:20,980
You know because searching for bang suggesting the chat room works too because the search is pretty damn good in discord. That's a good point

1221
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:27,860
I installed the discord maybe a few days ago. It's interesting so far. I've never used it before other than

1222
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:31,940
This oh, yeah, you can also use the web app if you don't want to install an app

1223
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:35,220
And it's just basically about as functional. Yeah, that's what i'm using right now. Yeah

1224
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,300
As I right click I definitely see it's html5 ish. Yeah

1225
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:44,660
Yeah, i'm using a fancy snap pack mutiny os. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, there's also a snap of it

1226
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:46,660
Uh, if you just want to keep it all

1227
01:30:46,660 --> 01:30:48,660
All put away. So is it going to be a

1228
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:54,900
Irc replacement as I saw the stream. I was trying to find the stream chat

1229
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:59,540
I don't know if it's a replacement i'd say it's an alternative which seems to be better suited for live production

1230
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:04,020
So we still have the irc room too because uh, you know

1231
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,180
There's still like you can still hang out there and chat with people

1232
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:11,140
The discord though is kind of great because we can break it out into particular shows and categories

1233
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:15,460
We can do voice and chat it supports like images and previews

1234
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:18,020
Which is gives some people something to look at when they're watching the video version

1235
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:23,620
That is really sponsor are easier and clearer nice patreon integration patreon integration all that shit

1236
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:28,100
So it's nice for from a live production, but if you know, you just want a basic chat the irc still works

1237
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:30,980
Um mutiny times man

1238
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:35,620
So something that talks is there a way to talk? Is there a way to put the fact that we have two great guests?

1239
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:39,780
In the show in the title. I mean that seems like that what we should lead with because we have to oh, yeah, that's true

1240
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:42,100
Um ubuntu double header

1241
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:48,740
Double fisting ubuntu. No will was great will was great because uh, I could ask him did you have willow?

1242
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:54,820
Yeah, because we we weren't around because we were recording ours because of time zones. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah will came on and um,

1243
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:59,380
I think I got some really good questions that I think it's a pre-record with will and did that wasn't it? Yep

1244
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:02,260
Yep, and uh, it was and I did that. Um

1245
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:06,340
A lot too. I don't remember. I did that actually friday. I can't remember now

1246
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:10,820
um, and uh, so I asked will about um, you know, like snap stuff and

1247
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:14,100
You know pissing off upstream gnome and things like that and he had great answers

1248
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:19,220
He just didn't he just and the good you just really did a great job and didrocks had some great stories and shared an anecdote

1249
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:25,060
That's really great. It was just really fun to talk to those guys because they're they're um, what about hard workers inside?

1250
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:27,460
ubuntu inside

1251
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:31,540
Ubuntu a team ubuntu a team. I like that. It's not bad. That's not bad

1252
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:37,220
Ubuntu a team also talk. Does that also apply to unity? Can we can we derive two meanings from that?

1253
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:42,340
Maybe i'm really going to get some shit for this episode, especially from all the people that are running arch

1254
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,420
And they're really going to hate this aren't they?

1255
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:47,380
It's a little switch to open to now

1256
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:52,020
The dda team dda team

1257
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:54,660
That's how you say his name dda. Yeah

1258
01:32:54,660 --> 01:32:57,540
I just stuck with didrocks. I didn't fuck that up because i'm sick of that

1259
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:02,180
I had enough of that this episode everyone calls him didrocks to his face. Yeah. Yeah, I was cursed this

1260
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:25,220
This was the episode from hell for me. You
