00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 40 for May 13th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that just hit its distinguished

3
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,240
forties. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey there, Matt. Forty weeks, buddy, right

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,560
in a row, too. Man. I mean, it's no Coderadio 100 or TechSnap 160, whatever, but I'm a little

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,520
proud of it, because this is just a little idea we have. We're like, hey, we've got too

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,440
much show every week. Let's do another show. Right. Here we are 40 weeks later. I think

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,400
it's turned out pretty good. Not to pat ourselves on our own back or anything like that. No.

8
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,600
It's going to be a fun show today, too. We're introducing a new segment in this week, so

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,200
I'll tell you about that in just a second. Of course, we've got our feedback like we

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,280
always do, and two developers from the LXQT project have joined us to discuss our first

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,240
look that we had over the weekend at LXQT, just at their first major beta. We're going

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,080
to chat with them in a little bit. Then we'll get to that new segment. So that new segment

13
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,880
I mentioned, we're going to call it the Mumble Roundtable. Right now, I've submitted a link

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,740
to our chat room, and they are voting on what should be the roundtable's topic. I've proposed

15
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,840
two topics. I don't pick the topic. The live stream picks the topic. Right now, the two

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,720
topics we have proposed to them is the orange box that Canonical announced today. It is

17
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,440
an Ubuntu cluster in a box. It's a pretty cool concept, and it's made up of like 10

18
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:00,200
NUCs in a box, 10 Intel NUCs in a box, and it's a pretty neat deal. Also, the second

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,800
topic that is being voted on, so there's two choices. Choice number two, antivirus pioneer

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,280
Alan Solomon thinks that antivirus is dead, and he says he switched to Linux instead.

21
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,340
So whichever one is the winning topic towards the end of the show will be our open roundtable

22
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,120
discussion that we'll get to. So I'm looking forward to that to kind of give our virtual

23
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:27,440
lug a chance to stretch out a little bit and pontificate on a good topic. But, Matt, before

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,960
we get to that, we should probably start with the feedback, because there was something

25
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
that, man.

26
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Oh, boy.

27
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,480
Chief of the Broadcasting was off the air basically yesterday for Chrome users.

28
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,440
Yeah, what was up with that?

29
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,120
Case of the Mondays. So Mark writes in, and he says, hey, I can get an old malware warning.

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,040
I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 with XFCE and Chromium. I like that he's giving us the XFCE, like,

31
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,200
just so you know. I'm getting a malware error in Chromium, but I'm running on it. OK. Tried

32
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,080
to download the HD video version of Last 3.11, and I got a malware warning from Chromium.

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,560
Probably a bug, but I thought I should let you know about it. Love the show. Now, we

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,760
got a lot of emails like this, but Mark had a good, concise email. And Mark also was kind

35
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,280
enough to include a screenshot. So if you didn't get to enjoy this error that was happening

36
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,400
to us yesterday, there it is. It says, the website ahead contains malware.

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Oh, boy.

38
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,520
It says, Chromium has blocked access. Now, if you read carefully, it actually says, Chromium

39
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,640
has blocked access to www.podtrack.com. It actually wasn't a problem with the Jupyter

40
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,200
Broadcasting website. It was a problem with the download stat tracking service we use.

41
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,280
PodTrack's kind of like the gold standard in legitimate podcast statistic download counts.

42
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,400
As good of a service there is, it's pretty much PodTrack. Now, the problem was their

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,280
whole domain got blacklisted by the Google anti-malware whatever it is, and so every

44
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,560
podcaster that uses PodTrack had their downloads unavailable to Chromium users and then Chrome

45
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,440
users and then eventually Firefox and eventually Safari and other browsers later in the day

46
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,860
all got their downloads blocked. I mean, this is not only taking out Jupyter Broadcasting,

47
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,720
but it took out Twit, it took out NPR, the Nerdist, the Discovery Networks. All of those

48
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,200
guys that use PodTrack were nailed by this. Now, our awesome web developer, Aaron, was

49
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,040
able to, about midway in the day, I said, all right, I call uncle. Aaron, can you please

50
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,240
go in there and just pull all the PodTrack links from our site? Because this also affected

51
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,600
the HTML5 video player. So even just trying to stream video from our website, the only

52
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,480
thing that worked was the live stream. And Lynn this morning, earlier this morning, PodTrack

53
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,200
sends an email. He says, hi, Chris. Dear Chris, yesterday we discovered an issue with the

54
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,680
PodTrack domain that impacts some non-iTunes podcast users. Yeah, like everyone using Chrome.

55
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,480
It's like, come on, really guys?

56
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,240
Yeah. You know, for those idiots that don't use iTunes, the Chrome browser blocked PodTrack.com

57
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
domain reporting it as malware, followed later by Firefox and Safari as they use the same

58
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,400
malware list as Google. At the same time, Chrome's diagnostic page said there's no reports

59
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,120
of malware for this domain in the last 90 days. And for more than eight years, we have

60
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,840
not seen a browser return the domain as malware. They scanned the servers ourselves and we

61
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,720
didn't find any malware. We requested a review from Google and sometime between 1 a.m. and

62
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,400
7 a.m. Eastern today, so that's this morning, Chrome and other browsers corrected their

63
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,960
listing of PodTrack.com domain and the services are working in all browsers again. So we essentially

64
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,600
just didn't have, so for the first half of the day we didn't have downloads, for the

65
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,160
second half of the day and into today we didn't have any tracking. So not a great day for

66
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,120
us and not a great day for podcast listeners either. And in a way too, doesn't it show

67
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,560
you how dangerous it can be to consolidate power like that on the web? Because even though

68
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,260
that anti-malware tool does a lot of good and it saves a lot of Windows users' butts,

69
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:49,120
it also can go very badly. And in this case, it essentially took an entire industry, the

70
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Google malware system took an entire industry off the air. Now did PodTrack have a legitimate

71
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,540
malware? They claim not, but maybe they did. I mean they do use IIS after all, so it seems

72
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,200
entirely conceivable they did have something. But the end result for me was like, oh well

73
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,920
sorry, all of our listeners and downloaders are getting this big old scary error that

74
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,000
makes it look like the Jupiter Broadcasting website has malware on it. So it's not a good

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,120
experience all around. And I hope that Google, this isn't the first time we've seen something

76
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,400
like this happen, I think this is maybe the largest scale outage that the Google anti-malware

77
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:28,400
service has caused, and it's not a great experience. So I apologize to you guys out there who are

78
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,960
trying to download the Linux Action Show or the FoShow on Monday or Coda Radio and got

79
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,720
that error. Monday's a big day for us, so I know it affected a lot of folks out there,

80
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,360
I apologize about that. But it should all be resolved now. And the RSS feeds, for the

81
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,440
most part, weren't impacted as far as I know. So if you ever want to just bypass it, just

82
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,960
subscribe in your favorite RSS client, maybe it's G Potter or Miro or whatever it is, and

83
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,120
that might have solved the problem.

84
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,960
All right Matt, next email comes in from Gargan, I think, Jarjan?

85
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Gargan, okay.

86
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,400
Well I'm not, I apologize, I'm not getting that one right. He has a little follow-up

87
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,240
on our fragmentation time bomb discussion. He says he feels that fragmentation isn't

88
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,280
really an issue. Consider Qt and GTK, so what? You have them both on Windows and even OS

89
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,080
again. Does using Qt on iOS fragment iOS? Not one bit. It's still iOS, a well-defined

90
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,160
target for developers with a semi-stable API. Look at the toolkits that Windows has. Microsoft

91
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,640
foundation classes, the Windows template library, Smart Win++, the Object Windows library,

92
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,560
Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Qt, GTK+, Swing, and WX Widgets, all on Windows.

93
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,800
The problem is a fragmented core. Examples would be the multitude of glibc, unstable

94
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,240
kernel driver API, systemd, sysv, upstart, glib, mesa, kairo, gstreamer, pulseaudio,

95
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,160
and versions that compromise, or all versions that compromise the bedrock of the OS. So

96
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,800
I was arguing yesterday that, yeah, the core is stable. He's saying, no it's not. It doesn't

97
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,800
matter what's happening up in user land. Let them use whatever toolkits they want. What

98
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,240
really matters is we have stable APIs and ABIs to target. And that's something we've

99
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,800
heard from driver developers for years too. Do you think, Matt, maybe I was a little off

100
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,840
the mark? Maybe I was misrepresenting how fragmented the Linux core is?

101
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,560
I don't think so. I definitely see what they're saying. And I definitely agree with it to

102
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,160
an extent. But I also think that because we're so freewheeling that we don't really have

103
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,160
a dominant anything in the ecosystem. And I think that's probably kind of where a lot

104
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,400
of people find frustration, including yourself. I think that's kind of the frustration we

105
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,080
have. So I half agree with him. But at the same time, I also think that we do need to

106
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,400
kind of, in user land, kind of figure out what we're doing, at least with the dominant

107
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,840
distributions. And then everybody else can just do whatever they want.

108
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,360
That being said, our biggest problem is we have half the camp that adamantly loves the

109
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,240
fact that we have no dominant anything. And then we have the other half the camp that

110
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,960
hates it. And as long as we have that, I don't ever see this getting resolved. I think it's

111
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,000
always going to be a good effort.

112
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,040
Always wasted effort, Matt, until it gets resolved. Yeah. And you know, it's kind of

113
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,200
like evolution in a sense. Like eventually dominant strains and implementations stand

114
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,600
out in a way. And eventually, it's a lot messier. It takes a lot longer. I think it eventually

115
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,640
gets worked out. And I think things like system D, and I think the kernel API thing is a valid

116
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,080
complaint. But I don't think it's as valid as it used to be. So I think it's over time,

117
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,600
it is actually just kind of improving upon itself.

118
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,080
Nico writes in. He says, thanks for the great show. I really like it, but. And there's always

119
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,680
a but, Matt.

120
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
Always the but.

121
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,120
I was extremely disappointed with your discussion on Menjia in episode 39. I almost never write

122
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,220
any kind of comments to anybody, but this just got me so sad that I just have to write

123
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,120
this one. Now, he specifically laid out what he didn't like. I wouldn't went ahead and

124
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,280
cut it because these emails that we're getting these days are just way too long. So I'm editing

125
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,440
a little bit. So I just I wanted to kind of just touch on some of his core points. He

126
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,640
says, first of all, what I was the most disappointed with was that you guys obviously did no research

127
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,000
on the subject yourself. You just let the Mamba room tell you what they think about

128
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,820
Menjia and maybe it's OK, but by doing so, you sure made it sound a whole lot more difficult

129
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,280
and strange than it really is. And I must say, I don't I do not even understand half

130
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,400
of what the complaints were. So long story short, do your own research. I think he's

131
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,960
going to give any specifics. I mean, it's basically he just did exactly what he said

132
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,640
the Mamba. Well, I kind of cut some of it to make it. I mean, the one thing like he

133
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,280
took the most issue with was our discussion around packages and and like some of the how

134
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,120
some of the weird packages in the repos and stuff like that night. I just saw him based

135
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,040
into discussion. I mean, it's he loses right there. I mean, it's far as I'm that's not

136
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,040
even a debate now. I mean, that's not to say it's not a nice distribution from other aspects

137
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,640
of it, but that's that's through years and years of banging my face into RPM distros.

138
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,480
That's that's well researched. Yeah, I mean, I do see your point there. I mean, I don't

139
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,900
know, man. I mean, maybe we should put it on the schedule down the road in a few weeks.

140
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,680
Maybe we should throw Miji on our machines and just kind of, you know, see what we maybe

141
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,920
maybe, you know, like because I was pretty sure when we took the arts challenge, I was

142
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,680
going to be like Mr. Nose up near. This is stupid. Yeah, I know. And I'm speaking exclusively

143
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,240
of packaging worth with arch. I had no experience with the packaging. Yeah, that's true. I mean,

144
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,200
we do know magic dust to make RPM suck less. And they maybe they do. I don't know. There

145
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,160
is you are PMI in there. Yeah. Well, you know, I mean, I think it's worth a try. Sure. Yeah,

146
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,320
I see what you're saying, though. Like arch is a fully different piece. But you're you've

147
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,160
been down the RPM alley before, you know, what's at the end of that looking distro.

148
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,600
I mean, I'm not not negating that at all. I think they did a lot of things right. But

149
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,280
at the end of the day, for me, it's more than appearance packages, packages, packages. I

150
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,240
I could have the ugliest desktop in the world. But if I got the packages I need, I'm happy.

151
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,080
You know, that's just me. Yeah, I you know what? You make a lot of sense. And so let's

152
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,460
give it some thought. Maybe you and I can do a little collab after Sunday on Sunday's

153
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,220
last and figure out if there's a spot where we can slip in a Miji review and you know,

154
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,640
but I kind of I kind of see your point, too. Like we have I got a certain time you've been

155
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,720
around the block enough that you kind of learn like, you know, sometimes there's just no

156
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,400
change in a distro. I don't know. We'll see. I don't mean I don't want to make it so heavy.

157
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,520
So you and I will talk on Sunday. Maybe we'll decide to schedule it in the last and we'll

158
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,880
do it. I have a feeling we're going to do it, but we'll talk about it. All right. With

159
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,140
our rights in, he says, Hey, there, Chris and Matt. Love the show. I'm writing in for

160
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,200
an idea of how to Linux for how to Linux. Now, we get a lot of these, but I just thought

161
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,920
I'd take this opportunity to kind of update everybody on where we're at with how to Linux

162
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,480
is I'm writing in on an idea for the show. My idea is using a digital ocean droplet and

163
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,940
install a light desktop on it using X to go and X RDP server on a thin client to connect

164
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,240
to the droplet over the Internet. You could have local sound, print and drive forwarding.

165
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,240
I realize it's not a simple how to, but I'd love to see your approach to the task. Cheers

166
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,440
for an interesting idea. Turning a digital ocean droplet into essentially a remote cloud

167
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,320
desktop server. So I'm going to give you guys an update on where we're at with how to Linux.

168
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,520
But first, why don't I give a thanks to our first sponsor? And that is Digital Ocean.

169
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,800
Digital Ocean is simple cloud hosting. And I got to tell you guys, we got a great brand

170
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,620
new promo code for the month of May. Guess what it is? Unplugged May. Unplugged May will

171
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,680
get you a ten dollar credit so you can try out digital ocean for two months for free.

172
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,040
If you get the five dollar, you don't know what digital ocean is. Digital Ocean is a

173
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,760
simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to

174
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,720
spin up a cloud server. Now, you're like, oh, sure. Sure, Chris. Sure. I got a tweet

175
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,020
this week. I think our new record is thirty seven seconds. Thirty seven seconds. Now,

176
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,020
most digital ocean users can spin up a cloud server in about fifty five seconds or so.

177
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,360
Not our audience. Our audience is now thirty seven seconds. But here's the best part. Pricing

178
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,720
plan started only five dollars a month for five hundred twelve megabytes of RAM, a twenty

179
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,400
gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer for five dollars. That's a you know exactly

180
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,160
how much you're going to pay. It's a fixed cost. It's not going to scale up for CPU usage.

181
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,160
You know, you're not going to get you're not going to get charged one price for two hundred

182
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,520
gigabytes of transfer and a different price for nine hundred gigabytes of transfer. You

183
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,480
get a terabyte. It's included with that. And Digital Ocean has data center locations in

184
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,360
New York, San Francisco, Singapore and Amsterdam. Their interface is simple. Their control panel

185
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,880
is super intuitive and power users can replicate this control panel on a larger scale with

186
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,160
their straightforward API. I have heard so many awesome stories of what our audience

187
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,200
is using Digital Ocean for. So go over there, use the promo code for the month of May. Unplugged

188
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,960
May. One word, unplugged May will get you that ten dollar credit. You can try out a

189
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,920
Digital Ocean droplet for two months, even if you only use it for two months or just

190
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,480
increase your own skill set. Work on something that you've been wanting to do. Scratch that

191
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,840
itch. Try out that thing. They've got a great image backup system. So if you screw something

192
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,600
up, just take a snapshot first. Revert right back. You get tier one bandwidth. It's all

193
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,220
sitting on top of SSD drives with, I got to tell you, some of the best data center locations

194
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,420
in the world. DigitalOcean.com. Use the promo code unplugged May to get that ten dollar

195
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,400
credit. Go check them out and see what you can do. A really big thank you to DigitalOcean

196
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:11,600
for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. Every month I find something new to do with my droplet

197
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,840
and in this Sunday's last, I think we're going to be scratching an itch for you guys or at

198
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,680
least we're going to make something itch and you're going to want to scratch it. So keep

199
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,800
Digital Ocean in mind when we start talking about some server stuff on Sunday. DigitalOcean.com

200
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,720
and use the promo code unplugged May and a really big thank you to those guys. Really

201
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,840
appreciate them sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show and there's so many cool things you can

202
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,560
do with it and you know what? It's all built on top of Linux so that's pretty cool too,

203
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,520
right? So now you're supporting a company that also runs on top of Linux using KVM and

204
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,240
all kinds of stuff. They really get their users. I think that's the big takeaway. It's

205
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,320
just awesome. Now we have joining us two developers from the LXQT project. Now I know them by

206
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,320
their mumble names but maybe we'll get to know their actual names. Starting first is

207
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,200
Jay Lanch. Am I saying that right? That's Jerome Leclanche. Jay Leclanche. Jerome, welcome

208
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,240
to Linux Unplugged and we also have PC Man joining us. And PC Man, what's your first

209
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:13,360
name? PC Man? My name is in Chinese. My name is Hongren Yu. So I use this ID for short.

210
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:20,460
And you're talking to us from Taiwan, right? Yes, I'm from Taiwan. And Jerome is in Cambridge

211
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,920
I believe. So we got a 10 o'clock and a 5 a.m. are here with us. So I really appreciate

212
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,840
you guys joining us. We're going to keep it brief since it is so after hours and the connection

213
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:35,800
is a little shaky but the one thing that really struck me is LXQT as we looked at it on Sunday

214
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,780
on the Linux action show, kind of looks like it's almost for a lot of users, Matt said

215
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,560
he might be one of them, ready to use today. How far along do you guys see yourself? I

216
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,760
don't know who's maybe the best person to ask. PC Man, what is your role at the LXQT

217
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:58,280
project? Melanie, I'm responsible for the file manager.

218
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:05,960
Oh okay. And some other parts, yeah. And Jay Lanch, what is your role at the LXQT project?

219
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:13,360
I do mostly system administration and UX but PC Man is underselling himself. He's really

220
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:20,440
the guy who built the original LXD Qt project before we merged with Razer Qt. Well, big

221
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:27,040
respect because I think the work is remarkable already. So PC Man, I'll start with you then.

222
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,320
How far along do you consider it right now? Is this sort of halfway baked? Is this five

223
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,600
percent baked? Is it almost done? Where do you see it at right now in your opinion?

224
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:46,340
It's not completely finished now. We still need some more translations and artwork and

225
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:53,720
there are some remaining bugs but actually it's already working and use it daily.

226
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,440
How are you guys seeing response from a user base? Are you seeing people circle around

227
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:06,480
and get excited? We've had a really huge uptake from our recent

228
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,080
release. You got to understand that before it was LXQT, it was Razer Qt. Razer Qt already

229
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,640
had its own kind of community. LXQT really is the continuation of that. It was just kind

230
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,440
of on the back burner for a while. So are you guys, being honest with me, are

231
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,480
you on a Qt holy war or is this one of these things that you were looking at it from a

232
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,260
practical standpoint. You said, I like the direction Qt is going in. I think we could

233
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,600
build a compelling desktop around it. This is a major going from a GTK based desktop

234
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:45,480
switching over to Qt, merging two popular projects. Is there a larger motivation there

235
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,520
PC Man? Yes, actually we are. One of the reasons is

236
00:18:51,520 --> 00:19:04,680
the GTK3. When we try to port LXDE to GTK3, we encounter many problems and some APIs are

237
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:17,360
changed and some even with different behavior and the themes are changed too. So actually

238
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,760
it's not very backward compatible. So was the sense that it was moving away from

239
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,420
being a toolkit for all and maybe a toolkit specific for the GNOME desktop and since you

240
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,920
weren't necessarily interested in creating the GNOME desktop, you needed to move something

241
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:40,800
that gave you more flexibility and a quote unquote freedom? Am I grokking?

242
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:47,640
Pretty much correct. This is pretty much what we've seen from a lot of GTK developers who

243
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:55,520
feel that GTK is becoming way too GNOME centric. This was the experience of the LXDE desktop

244
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:06,600
but on the Razer side of things, we just like Qt. We've always been Qt developers and we

245
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,800
want to continue being Qt developers. So it was kind of just two projects with the same

246
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,960
goals. Right. And you guys seem to be positioning

247
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,020
the desktop in a pretty good spot. There's a lot of people who are seeing these trends

248
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,520
that are interested in Qt development and I think that's a big one. I think people that

249
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,760
are looking to switch to Linux that are interested in Qt development but they're also interested

250
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:32,400
in having a more minimal desktop experience. And when you guys decided to go forward with

251
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,080
the merger, was it with this sort of 50,000 foot view of, well, this is the way the landscape

252
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,760
is going and so we should make this merger or was it, this is what I want to do and now

253
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:51,240
just by happenstance, you guys seem to be in this really great position for the desktop?

254
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,700
I'll take this one. Basically, when we decided to merge, the LXDE Qt project was just getting

255
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:08,000
started and it was based on a lot of Razer Qt parts and on the side of Razer Qt, we had

256
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,840
a lot of problem developer wise. We had about four or five active developers and it kept

257
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,280
cycling between people leaving the project and people joining the project so we never

258
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,600
really had a solid team. So the merger was really from a need of having more activity

259
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:35,800
and was really successful in that sense. How many people are working on the LX Qt project

260
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:45,760
at this point? I would say about a dozen but as I said, we've had a lot of uptake recently.

261
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,320
Any talks of like a commercial sponsor who might provide funding for some full-time development?

262
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:59,440
You guys been approached? No approach? No?

263
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,720
We've not really had, I mean, some people contacted us not directly for sponsoring but

264
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:14,440
we're definitely open to it and a couple of our community members want to fund the project

265
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,660
as well. Great. The other really great use I could see

266
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:25,960
for LXQt are enterprise desktops where they want a cute environment and they don't necessarily

267
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,720
need Gnome 3 or full KDE. These are just business class machines. Perhaps a more traditional

268
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,000
interface is actually a performance or I guess a productivity improvement. It's a good thing

269
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,820
for productivity to be a little more classical. To me, I could seriously see commercial entities

270
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:49,640
getting interested in wanting to encourage LXQt's development because imagine a CentOS

271
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:57,000
based distribution around the LXQt desktop. It's like this is your iron solid bullet proof

272
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,320
desktop that looks and works a lot like your old XP machine did but this is now you guys

273
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,880
are a Qt development shop. This is a made up scenario but here's your Qt development

274
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,560
shop. Here's a great desktop that works for you.

275
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,160
Then of course, it's for enthusiast users who want to eek the most performance for games

276
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,200
and things like that but still want to feel like they're not totally stuck in the 90s.

277
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,960
I think it's a very interesting project, guys. Was there anything you wanted to mention or

278
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,320
touch on from our review that we did on Sunday or any follow up before I let you guys go?

279
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:34,440
I wanted to say I really liked the review. I watched it yesterday. I really liked the

280
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:42,560
review. The KDE system settings, you were talking about system settings, having three

281
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,400
or four different system settings and you actually reviewed the KDE system settings

282
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,640
not the actual LXQt one.

283
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:57,400
It's hard to tell when you do it on an Ubuntu installation. At the same time, I also felt

284
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,440
like LXQt was sort of like, hey, whatever you want to use to configure. I didn't feel

285
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,360
like I was being forced to use a specific set of configuration tools too. Is that intentional

286
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:15,440
or is that just where things are at right now?

287
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
What do you mean?

288
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,600
Well, for example, it seemed to me like, and I don't know if this was just the PPA archive

289
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:26,460
that I was pulling it from, but if I wanted to use the KDE settings to configure something,

290
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,600
it seemed to work. It seemed to allow it for what I was doing at least. I was just curious

291
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,920
if I know there's a modular aspect to LXQt. Is that the modular you mean? I can use this

292
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,040
as my default file manager. I use this as my default configuration program for my whatever.

293
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:48,120
Or will there be a very specific set of LXQt configuration tools that as the desktop matures,

294
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,920
those are the ones you use regardless?

295
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:59,480
Okay, it's modular, but it's not that modular as you think because part of this is because

296
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:07,120
the design of Qt. When you run some KDE programs, you will notice that they do not apply the

297
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,440
setting from your Qt config because they have their own module and doing this. KDE guys

298
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,480
have their own platform plugin to improve integration with KDE, so their programs sometimes

299
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:30,200
do not load the settings from Qt config, so you will have inconsistent settings among

300
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,920
the Qt program sometimes, and it's hard to solve. We suffer from a similar problem because

301
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:45,680
independent Qt programs sometimes load different settings than yours. We implemented Qt plugin

302
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:54,680
to solve this, so there are still some limitations and some settings only apply to our desktop

303
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:01,880
session, so not all of the tools can be used outside LXQt, but we will do our best to make

304
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
it.

305
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,000
All right, that makes sense. I understand how that could happen. Yeah, it seems like

306
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,080
that, and that's probably something in a few years it'll get worked out on the Qt side.

307
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,600
All right, guys. Well, thank you very much for coming on the show today. I really appreciate

308
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,560
it. I know the times are a little crazy where you guys are at, and all over the world too

309
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,920
at that, especially PC man. I really appreciate it, and keep up the awesome work on the Pac-Man

310
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:30,340
file manager or the PC file manager. Anyways, that is a great file manager, and I'm loving

311
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,880
the Qt implementation, so great work on that. Matt, I've got a little question I want to

312
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,320
toss towards the audience that's going to help inform this Sunday's Linux action show.

313
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:47,400
In fact, it's a bit of a survey. It's something I want to talk about. We've talked before

314
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,000
on the Linux action show about building the ultimate Linux home server, and in the past

315
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,560
our builds have always been Ubuntu-based, 1204 and 1210, somewhere in there, and so

316
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:06,000
now that we're over at JB1, we've been sort of building out a new server infrastructure.

317
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,760
We've got a free NAS here. It's a free NAS mini from IX Systems. Then we have in front

318
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,280
of that a Proxmox machine. It's running multiple different instances, and I'm going to go into

319
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:22,240
more detail on the big show, of Linux in front of that free NAS VM, and we're loading up

320
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,800
different services on there, and I kind of want to ask the audience what makes your perfect

321
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,200
Linux server. If you're going to load on your house or something like that, so I just put

322
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,960
the link to the survey in the chat room if people want to fill that out, and while they're

323
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,920
doing that, while they're answering the questions, it's a pretty quick survey, while they're

324
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,480
answering those questions, I want to tell you about our second sponsor this week, and

325
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,200
that is Ting. What is Ting? Ting is mobile. It makes sense. It's my mobile service provider

326
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,280
and Matt's mobile service provider, and you know what we love about Ting? You only pay

327
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,720
for what you use. I know it sounds insane. It sounds impossible. There's no way you only

328
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,400
pay for what you use, but that's what's great about Ting. It's $6 a month for every line

329
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,960
you have, and then just any applicable taxes, and your usage on top of that. I know. You're

330
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,520
like, Chris, that's too good of a deal, and I'd be like, well, listener, how come you

331
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,880
don't trust me by this point, but if you don't believe me, maybe you'd believe Kyra.

332
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,960
Ting keeps rates simple. We don't make you pick a plan. Instead, you just use your phone

333
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,680
as you normally would. How much you use determines how much you pay each month. You can have

334
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,240
as many devices as you want on one account. That's good, because when you use more, you

335
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,560
pay less per minute, message, or megabyte of data. Your usage plus $6 per active device

336
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,680
on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill. Simple. That's what we mean when we

337
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,200
say mobile. That makes sense.

338
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,880
One of the great things about Ting too is the Ting dashboard. As I've been a customer

339
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,480
now for well over a year, I really, really appreciate this. The other thing that's really

340
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,960
great about Ting is they're great at just blogging about what they're working on, what

341
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,240
they're thinking about the industry as a whole. As somebody who follows this stuff, I like

342
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,600
to be an informed consumer. I think this is one of also my favorite features. They had

343
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,080
an interview with one of their sysadmins on their blog about how Ting uses data to make

344
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,200
sure that when they make a rate change, everybody is getting a good return on that change. I

345
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,480
think it's a really interesting and fascinating way that they do this. You can watch that

346
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,400
over on their blog. They're also helping out with budget tips. This is something they think

347
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:26,400
about a lot. They've got a new guy in who's doing blogs on finance tips and things like

348
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,600
that in general. Of course, it includes saving money on your Ting account. Go over to linux.ting.com.

349
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,240
That lets them know you heard about it right here on the Linux Unplugged show. I'll also

350
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,240
get you $25 off. If you want to grab a Ting phone, they'll take $25 off your first phone

351
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,400
if you already have a phone. If you're just going to switch over and you're going to port

352
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,280
your phone, you're going to BYOD, they'll take $25 off your first month or they'll give

353
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,400
you $25 credit that paid for more than my first month. Ting has a whole range of devices.

354
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,280
They have the Sanyo 3810 Red starting at $52. You own this phone outright. Then you're only

355
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,720
paying for your usage on top of that. You can get a feature phone, one of the best feature

356
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,160
phones out there. These Sanyos are amazing with these really cool front displays where

357
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:13,000
the clock shows through for $52. It's yours. You own it. It's not subsidized. There's no

358
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,920
contract and there's no early termination fee. They've got a whole range of really great

359
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,760
devices. Go over to linux.ting.com. Also try out that savings calculator. One of the things

360
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,640
I realized is for about a year, I was saying, oh yeah, my cell phone bill was about $125.

361
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,640
And Ann's just like, actually, you know your cell phone bill was $140 a month? When I plugged

362
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,440
in my old cell phone bill to the savings calculator, it came out to $2,200 over two years that

363
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,920
I'm saving. That's a new computer every two years right there just by switching to Ting.

364
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:50,240
I could buy myself a fully loaded Ultra Pro every two years by switching to Ting. That

365
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,640
was a massive statement because I realized I kind of was willing to make some sacrifices.

366
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,100
I was willing to kind of get into a bad deal because I was honestly a little distracted

367
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:04,080
by the shiny nature of smartphones and how cool they were. And then I got a couple years

368
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,880
into it and I said, wait, what am I, $140 a month? What am I doing? I didn't even realize

369
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,720
that's what I was spending. It didn't really click with me. I didn't realize it was that

370
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,360
much money. And now looking back at it, what was I wasting my money on? I didn't get my

371
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,240
value out of that. Linux.ting.com, go get the value out of your mobile service plan

372
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,280
and a really big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. And by the way, no hold customer

373
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,320
service. How awesome is that? You don't have to, if you call in between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m.

374
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,160
Eastern time, you don't have to hold. And you know what? I really appreciate that. I

375
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,440
really do. All right, Matt, I want to talk about the perfect home server. So here's what

376
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,600
I've asked the audience and hopefully they're filling these out right now. So you're building

377
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,200
a brand new Linux home server. You're using everything you've learned or heard about over

378
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,280
the recent years. You're starting from scratch. What would you start with? So, oh, well, goodbye

379
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:00,280
Matt. What would you start with is what I asked the audience. And so I put out the call.

380
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,120
They're doing the survey right now. Hello, are you back? I am back. I have no idea what

381
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,160
happened. I think, I don't know. Maybe the gremlins infected Skype. I don't know what

382
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:16,360
happened. So I've asked the audience to go out and fill out that survey right now. This

383
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,260
will help inform the Linux action show on Sunday. I'll incorporate some of their feedback.

384
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,760
See what we get. I'm kind of curious what people, also I left a spot in there to just

385
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,040
kind of describe your dream setup and all those kinds of things. So go out there, fill

386
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,960
out that form. It's the perfect home server. And I'd be really curious to see what you

387
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,720
guys would do and see if it lines up with, oh, we're already getting some results in

388
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,040
right now. And by the way, you can see the results that I set in the form to allow people

389
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,440
to see the results. So open media vault, looks like I'm getting an open media vault. Sabnzb,

390
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,080
Plex, Subsonic. Oh yeah, Subsonic's a good one. I should have put that in the check box.

391
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:57,080
BitTorrent Sync, File and Network Services, Couch Potato. So we're getting a lot. And

392
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,600
also I asked folks if they would just avoid building a LAN server and maybe just do like

393
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,680
a VPS, like a digital ocean droplet. But we'll see. We'll see where folks go on this. I'm

394
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:13,280
kind of curious because what we've got set up here now at JB1 is a Proxmox rig sitting

395
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:19,800
on an i7 box with some internal storage and then some NFS storage. And it's pretty neat

396
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,480
because we set up an arch server. Yes, an arch server. I'm going to talk about more

397
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,320
of that on Sunday while we're doing that. We set up an arch server and then we, you

398
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,720
know, to save ourselves time down the road, made a template of it. And now we can just

399
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,760
deploy these arch boxes. And so I've got one arch machine that's limited to two cores.

400
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,120
And that way, like if it's doing things like BitTorrent Sync or Sab NZB Usenet downloads,

401
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,000
it can't go too crazy. And then we've got an encoder box on there that's for Rekai to

402
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,400
bang on for doing like a show encodings. And I just like, I said, just have at it. Do whatever

403
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,360
you want. You get eight cores. You can use up as much. When Rekai wants to take over

404
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,680
the rig, like he just logs into this one virtual machine that I set up for him and he gets

405
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:04,600
full control of all of the resources. And it's this cool way to kind of provision stuff

406
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,120
from one machine that, you know, isn't necessarily busy all the time. So why not? And what's

407
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,900
really kind of, I did some testing on the machine with only two cores assigned to it

408
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:19,640
and limited memory. We did an encode of this week's fo show and we were getting about 22

409
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:24,960
frames per second. When we switched to the encoding machine and with the eight cores

410
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,600
available and more RAM, it went up to 122 frames. We gained a hundred frames per second

411
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,080
improvement on the encoding speed. So now we've got an arch box. We're doing, and this

412
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,080
is even like optimized FFmpeg scripts yet. This is just the basic boxes. But now we're

413
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,640
going to start doing multi machine encoding using this Proxmox VM. And I thought, no way

414
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,480
are you going to encode inside a VM. That's crazy. You can't do that. Can't be done. No,

415
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,400
but it's actually, it's working okay. It could be a little faster, but beggars can't be choosers,

416
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,720
man. We, you know, you only, you only get so many. Yeah. All right. Well, I got a new

417
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,160
segment I want to introduce here in just a second, but before we do that, I want to just

418
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,480
mention we just got a few days left on the Koda radio, 100 hoodie and t-shirt teespring.com

419
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:14,480
slash CR 100. We've sold 154. There is six days, four hours, 14 minutes and 23 seconds

420
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,540
remaining until this shirt is no longer available. The hoodie, if you're in a cold area, might

421
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:25,640
be the way to go. It is hot, is over 80 degrees at JB one right now, 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

422
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,400
And so I'm looking at these red and orange Koda radio hoodies. Ange tells me the one

423
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,680
that's selling the best is this kind of dark gray is doing really well. So go to teespring.com

424
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,440
slash CR 100. Grab the limited Koda radio 100 shirt only available for a few more days

425
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,560
just to celebrate Koda radio and hitting a hundred episodes in a row too. Maybe one day

426
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,880
we'll have a Linux unplugged t-shirt up there, Matt. Nice. I'd love that. I can only dream.

427
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,840
So go get it while you can at teespring.com slash CR 100. No, we're not making a bunch

428
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,880
of money. This isn't a fundraiser shirt. We just did a limit of a hundred and we just

429
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,600
wanted something for the fans to be able to grab it. And I wanted some new shirts because

430
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,940
it's getting hot out there. So this isn't like any big money raiser, but it's still

431
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:14,680
a fun way to kind of celebrate. You know what I mean? All right, Matt. Well, it's time for

432
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:20,280
us to own up. We got to look at the results. Hazel Bishop's new longer lasting lipstick.

433
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,680
The only lipstick I found that stays on beautifully all around the clock. Now that wasn't what

434
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,840
I was talking about at all. I don't know where that came from. You know, I have been considering

435
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,420
changing my lipstick. All around the clock, Matt. All around the clock. No, actually what

436
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:40,360
it's really time for is our all hands on board round table. We asked the live stream before

437
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:47,160
we started, which topic would you like our round table to discuss? The antivirus pioneer

438
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,380
Alan Solomon who thinks antivirus is dead and now he switched to Linux or the orange

439
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:58,300
box, a $12,000 Ubuntu cluster. Now, Matt, what can you say about our audience when I

440
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,340
do a poll? What usually ends up happening, Matt? What do you usually get when we ask

441
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,920
our audience? What do you guys think about something? You know, I'm going to probably

442
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,320
roll off the hardware. I could be wrong. Yeah, I think we should because this is a

443
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:17,640
50-50 split right here. Our first one falls on its face. I said we would go with whichever

444
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,000
one polled ahead. 220 votes. You know what? I'm going to put that in the chat room. I'm

445
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,960
going to put it to a vote right now. We can have one person tip the scale. If you go to

446
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,640
right now live stream, go to strawpoll.me, slash 16-87-395. Go over there and tip it

447
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,040
one way and then that'll be our topic. They're both really interesting. However, I personally

448
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,760
think the Ubuntu one is slightly more interesting, but that's just me. All right, here we go.

449
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:51,460
The poll has been tipped to the Ubuntu orange box, 113 votes out of 223 votes. Ubuntu orange

450
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:59,320
box got 51% of the votes and the Antivirus guy got 49% of the votes. All right, Mumble

451
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,560
Room, so why don't we let Popey go first? Popey, can you tell us what the orange box

452
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:12,920
is and why it looks so damn cool? So it's a box that was designed by Canonical and built

453
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:20,320
by a company called Tranquil PC in the UK. It's got a bunch of Intel NUCs inside, which

454
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:28,200
are i5 computers that are passively cooled. It's got a gigabyte switch and the idea is

455
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,120
that you could use it as basically a cloud in a box. You could carry it around. It goes

456
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:39,960
in a flight case and you could cart it to a location and build a cloud locally, a private

457
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:47,480
cloud, no NSA snooping for you. And yeah, you're off and running with one box, one bright

458
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:54,460
orange box. So it has what, like 10 NUCs stuffed inside this orange box and then it has a gigabit

459
00:38:54,460 --> 00:39:01,280
switch integrated in this box and a USB hub, right? Yeah, it's impressive actually. We

460
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,320
saw it in the office a couple of months ago. Well, I saw it in the office and a bunch of

461
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:12,400
us were kind of peering in because they had the lid off and it was quite impressively

462
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,880
built. The guys at Tranquil PC have done a really nice job building this thing and I

463
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,800
know that at the time when they built it, I think it was a one off. Well, more than

464
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,480
one off because I saw two of them in the office. Well, so here's the specs. Okay, so it's 10

465
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Intel NUCs, specifically the Ivy Bridge D53427RKE model, rolls off the tongue, with an i5-3427U

466
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:40,440
CPU. It's got an HD 4000 graphics, 16 gigs of RAM in each NUC, a 20 gigabyte SSD, Intel

467
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,060
Gigabit NIC, and then they've got a D-Link gigabit switch in there with VLAN set up.

468
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:49,900
All 10 nodes are internally connected to that gigabit switch in aggregate. This micro cluster

469
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:56,520
effectively fields 40 cores, 160 gigabytes of RAM, 1.2 gigabytes of solid state storage,

470
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,360
and is connected over internal gigabit network. A single fan quietly cools the power supply

471
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,080
while all other nodes are passively cooled by aluminum heat sinks spanning the side of

472
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,760
the chassis. And then the first node, which is called node zero in the box, also has an

473
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:17,320
Intel Centrino Advanced N6235 Wi-Fi adapter, a two terabyte spinning hard drive, USB and

474
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,600
HDMI ports are wired and accessible from the rear of the box, and access to the USB and

475
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:28,260
HDMI of nodes one through nine are accessible under the unit. It also has six gigabit LAN

476
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,680
ports all connected to that internal switch that the NUCs are all connected to, which

477
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,800
is hooked up right there at the rear of the panel.

478
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,600
Doesn't that just sound amazing?

479
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
Yeah, it really-

480
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,160
Sounds like a lot of fun.

481
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,360
Like I've, you know, I've had some fun with the NUC recently, and I can tell you it's

482
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,080
a serious machine. You know, it's-

483
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:47,040
Yeah, so 10 of them must be 10 times the amount of fun, surely.

484
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,920
All right, so round table, mumble room, anybody in here, what do you guys think? Could you

485
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,420
see a use for an orange box like this? Could it be like, think about this, maybe like a

486
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,800
portable data center? I think this is pretty exciting. Anybody think this is bogus? Anybody

487
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,280
not excited by this?

488
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:10,160
Actually, I could think of several applications for something like this. For instance, you

489
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,800
know, for a doctor's office record keeping offsite, you know, that kind of thing. It

490
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,040
definitely has a use.

491
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,760
And I could see like two, like you could do everything working together in like one big

492
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,520
cluster or you could have one machine's the web server, one machine's the database server,

493
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,040
one machine's the file server, right? You could-

494
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,280
One's the Quazel server.

495
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:37,480
One's the Quazel server, exactly. I think this is a pretty compelling idea. And I think

496
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,760
it's interesting to kind of demonstrate maybe in a way how you could have extremely high

497
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:50,200
powered servers in a very small little container like this. You think about it, like the price

498
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,360
isn't that crazy. So it starts at, what, 7,500 euros and then depending on how you configure

499
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,000
it, the price is going to go up in there. But I mean, you can get a Mac Pro for that

500
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,280
price, right? And this is 10 machines in one box.

501
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:09,440
Yeah, Mark Shuttleworth unveiled it at the OpenStack conference in his keynote today.

502
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,960
And yeah, it's certainly had a lot of attention as a result.

503
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,160
Yeah, so there is an OpenStack thing going on right now. So I guess this was sort of

504
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,480
the big, this was the big show for Canonical, wasn't it?

505
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
One of them, yeah.

506
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,000
Oh, is there something else going on there?

507
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:34,400
Yeah, so Mark has a lot of the times he does a big tech demo or announces some new product.

508
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,120
And I think he gave two things away. One was the orange box and another was the fact that

509
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,520
there's the most powerful machine on the planet, the most powerful computer on the planet in

510
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:50,240
China happens to run Ubuntu on OpenStack, which is quite cool, really.

511
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,560
That is quite cool. Although I think we covered that in the Linux action show, so Mark should

512
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,040
watch last. That's all I'm saying. All right, hold on. I think I have the keynote that you

513
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,440
linked us earlier. Let's see if it'll play. I don't know if I have the audio from it or

514
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,840
not because I had to hook this machine up during the show. But it was pretty funny because

515
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:09,760
Mark was on stage revealing this orange box and he had it under a big curtain, like a

516
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,360
big sheet. So there's this big black sheet on stage with Mark Shuttleworth and he's walking

517
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,280
around it. He's not really drawing a lot of attention to it. And then at one point when

518
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,760
he introduces the orange box, when he starts talking about it, he pulls off the sheet and

519
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,200
then it's like, huzzah, here it is. It was a pretty good moment.

520
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,560
He loves the big reveal.

521
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,800
We'll have the keynote linked in the show notes. And Popeye was nice enough to give

522
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,080
us right to the time index so you can watch that big reveal since I didn't have it set

523
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,760
up for the show today. I apologize. Yeah, but I think it's a pretty neat thing. I mean,

524
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,440
the antivirus thing is a cool story too, but I felt like the antivirus thing is we already

525
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,040
kind of knew that. That guy was just saying stuff we already knew. Look at that, master

526
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,040
HDMI. That's so cool.

527
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:54,240
Here's the mirror to our question though. Can it play Minecraft?

528
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,360
I think it could. I think it could. Although it is-

529
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,320
Oh man, think how many Minecraft servers you could have inside that one box.

530
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,040
The problem is that HD4000 might be your limiting factor. I don't know.

531
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,400
What is a server? You could have a cluster of Minecraft servers in that box.

532
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,960
I'm thinking this is our new encoding rig, right? We just-

533
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,960
There you go.

534
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
That's not what I was thinking.

535
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,440
Yeah, we do a little GNU parallel scripting and go in there and get ffmpeg running across

536
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,920
all 10 NUCs and then it spits out a file in two seconds.

537
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,640
Oh man, I totally want one of those down.

538
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:34,920
Yeah. I find it compelling that it's just that single fan in the back too. They've obviously

539
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:39,080
taken every NUC. They're not even getting NUCs in the cases. They're like motherboard

540
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,000
NUCs mounted inside this thing.

541
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,000
They're all out of the boxes and they're all mounted on the side. There's a picture on

542
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,920
the Tranquil PC side of it upside down with the bottom off so you can see inside. All

543
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,680
the NUCs are mounted along, there's five on each side, I think, and they're mounted so

544
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,960
that the heat is dissipated through the outside of the case.

545
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,720
I was trying to find that on their website, but I don't see it. Yeah, because I saw that

546
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,800
on one of the Ubuntu announcement pages, but I don't see it on the Tranquil PC site. When

547
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,920
you saw this, does it look like they're actually buying full straight up NUCs from Intel and

548
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,520
then pulling them out of the boxes or does Intel sell them to OEMs just as the boards?

549
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,520
Did you get a sense?

550
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:26,560
I don't know. Tranquil PC build them. We contracted them to build them and they deal with all

551
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,640
that kind of stuff. I don't know whether they have someone sat there with a screwdriver

552
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,040
taking them out of the cases or whether they have a deal with Intel. I really don't know.

553
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:38,840
I like the idea though. I do like the idea that just a whole bunch of guys are at Canonical

554
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,960
and they get a big shipment of these things and they sit there and just take them out

555
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,000
of the box and they hook them up to this thing. I think that's a kind of funny idea.

556
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,440
I'll tell you what, there's a whole pile of empty NUC boxes you can chuck on eBay if you

557
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,440
wanted to.

558
00:45:51,440 --> 00:46:00,360
Well, I'm showing this picture, this image from a NUC right now. You know what? Rekai,

559
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,960
our production pipeline guy calls it the glue for the studio. It's like when you need to

560
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,040
hook two things up, you need a box in one place, you just stick a NUC there and it's

561
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:14,760
the perfect glue because it's small, it's tiny in terms of the space it takes up on

562
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,840
the table is actually beneficial but also the amount of power it draws and the sound

563
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:26,320
it makes is all very minimal. HDMI out is very nice. They've been really good rigs and

564
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:32,320
I love the idea too of not just having multiple cores but having multiple machines and then

565
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,280
having the ability to either have them all work together independently. I think it's

566
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,680
kind of a neat deal.

567
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,680
Now I know what I want. Now I want one, Matt.

568
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,680
Oh boy.

569
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,680
Oh boy.

570
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,120
I think System76 should get on there and then give us a review unit. That'd be great. You

571
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:50,200
know what? Tranquil PC if you guys want to send us a review unit. I'm just saying Linux

572
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,200
Action should take a look at that.

573
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,200
You okay with that?

574
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,200
Yeah, we could take a look at that. That'd be fine.

575
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,200
Sure.

576
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,160
I wouldn't mind. All right. Well, before we go, before we wrap up today's show, I'd like

577
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,440
to make a special request that you guys get out there. Oh, go ahead, Crash, if you had

578
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,440
something you wanted to add. I just saw that you flagged me.

579
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:11,000
I was just, I looked up the CPU that they have in those NUCs on the Intel Arc side.

580
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah, are you about to?

581
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,480
I noticed that they're actually one of the fully-enabled Intel CPUs. They've got all

582
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,360
the virtual machine stuff and all the directed IO and all that sort of thing as well. So

583
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,080
you think about for an office, like a small office that needs to run a bunch of machines,

584
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,760
you could stick one of those in there. They're not going to be ultra-fast VMs.

585
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,760
You specifically saw the-

586
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,240
You could run 20 virtual machines on it.

587
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,040
Right. You specifically saw it has VTXD support?

588
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,280
Yeah, it's got everything. I'm just going to look on the site now.

589
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:49,120
So the VTXD support's nice because then that means you can give direct access to hardware

590
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,520
to the virtual machine, which is really nice for storage and stuff. So that's really cool.

591
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,800
All right, well, there you go. We'll have links to all that stuff as well as the specs

592
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,320
listed out. And if you're curious about that antivirus guy who switched to Linux, we also

593
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:08,120
have that linked in the show notes. And I do want to ask you, if you do me a solid,

594
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,760
help us make this Sunday's Linux action show even better.

595
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,560
If you go over to the show notes, I have a link to the perfect home server form you can

596
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,200
fill out at home and let us know what you would. And add your own descriptions and things

597
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:25,480
like that and submit that. I'll be going over that. We're going to do, on Sunday, and now

598
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:32,080
I am having some free NAS problems right now. In fact, if anybody is familiar with how to,

599
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,920
on a free NAS box, just do a one-to-one swap out of a failed hard drive, I had my last

600
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,760
non-Western Digital Red drive in my free NAS rig, died yesterday or the day before. I got

601
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,320
the overnight drive replacement, I put the drive in, and free NAS does not have any interface

602
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,840
for just doing a swap of a drive. It still thinks the drive that died is still attached

603
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,240
to the pool, and so the pool is still all screwed up and the machine is locking up.

604
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:00,880
It's a free NAS catastrophe. So if anybody out there has any ideas or tips, I'd appreciate

605
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,280
that. Or if there's anything else you want to comment or give us a topic to chew on,

606
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,700
go over to jupitabroadcasting.com and click that contact link, and then choose Linux Unplugged

607
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,200
from the dropdown and send in your feedback to us. We'd love to start out the show with

608
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:17,200
a little bit of that. You can also go over to our subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

609
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,320
And don't forget, you can also join us live over at jblive.tv. We do this show Tuesdays

610
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,920
at 2 p.m. Pacific. You can get that converted to your local time zone by going over to jupitabroadcasting.com

611
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:33,520
slash calendar. Alright, Matt, so here's what you've got to get thinking about, alright?

612
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,440
You're thinking about what it would take to have Matt Hartley's perfect home server. Like

613
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,160
is it Plex on there, right? Yeah, I'm going to have to think about that. I have a couple

614
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:48,880
ideas. Yeah, so we'll talk about that on Sunday. We'll get the audience's ideas, and on top

615
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,540
of that, you'll see what we've come up with here at JB1 for the new setup. We've got some

616
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:57,320
pretty cool stuff we're doing, and it's kind of nuts how awesome this technology's gotten.

617
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:02,200
So we'll cover the perfect arch server on Sunday show, our ideas, plus the community's

618
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,200
ideas. So go over to the show notes for Linux Unplugged 40, find that Google Doc form, and

619
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,160
fill it out for us if you would. Alright, everyone, well thanks so much for tuning this

620
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,760
week's episode of Linux Unplugged. If we don't see you on Sunday for the big show, we'll

621
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:42,760
see you right back here next Tuesday. Bye, everybody!
