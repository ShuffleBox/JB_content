WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.840
You got something you want to hide or you just want to be a baller like this is it silk Guardian is an anti-forensic

00:07.720 --> 00:12.240
LKM kill switch that waits for a change on your USB ports and

00:12.840 --> 00:17.880
Then wipes your RAM and turns off your computer very much inspired by USB kill

00:17.880 --> 00:23.400
I made this project because I feel that it could be implemented better than already is so you make it you build it

00:23.400 --> 00:29.960
Three reasons why this project exists in case the po-po or other thugs come busting in I like that police are the first threat

00:29.960 --> 00:31.960
You know this guy must be a US citizen

00:31.960 --> 00:36.440
You don't want someone to retrieve documents from your computer via USB. That's true

00:36.440 --> 00:40.440
Or installs on my back doors. Yeah, you don't want malware or back doors

00:40.440 --> 00:47.000
You want to improve the security of your full disk encrypted home computer or server like maybe a Raspberry Pi actually that last one's kind

00:47.000 --> 00:51.600
Of legit yeah, so there you go if you want to just destroy your machine in one go silk Guardian

00:51.600 --> 00:54.640
I like that idea doesn't wipe the drive though. It just wipes the RAM, but I'm sure you could

00:55.280 --> 01:00.160
Customize heck yeah, you could heck yeah, you could I think that I think that could be that could be brilliant

01:00.160 --> 01:02.160
This is Linux unplugged episode

01:02.720 --> 01:04.520
133 for February 23rd

01:04.520 --> 01:06.520
2016

01:06.520 --> 01:11.520
2016

01:19.600 --> 01:25.240
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that might just be swimming in laptops

01:25.520 --> 01:31.280
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello there Wes. Guess what we got a great show. Yes, we do

01:31.280 --> 01:33.920
I'm really really looking forward to today's episode a

01:33.920 --> 01:38.780
We're gonna have a chance to talk about something that everybody else in the press is talking about everybody

01:38.960 --> 01:41.160
But they're getting it all wrong. They're getting it all wrong

01:41.640 --> 01:47.320
We're gonna talk about the big quote-unquote mint hack the ISO breach

01:47.720 --> 01:53.180
That has been getting a lot of attention since Linux action show on Sunday

01:53.720 --> 02:01.060
Then later on in the show. I am very excited to share my first hands-on impressions with intro airs

02:01.060 --> 02:03.700
Apollo laptop I

02:03.820 --> 02:07.660
West you can attest to this the first thing I do when I see people's I shove it in their hands

02:07.660 --> 02:10.020
Oh, yes, that's right. You didn't even have your bag set down yet

02:11.380 --> 02:13.840
Give me your impressions I have in the

02:14.940 --> 02:17.860
24 hours that I have had this laptop in my possession

02:17.860 --> 02:21.800
I've been going around getting people's opinions asking them what they think I've got my opinions

02:21.940 --> 02:25.980
I've set up my desktop the way. I like it. I'm gonna give you my first thoughts on

02:25.980 --> 02:31.460
Their ultimate Linux laptop, so that's gonna be an interesting comparison from last week's episode

02:31.460 --> 02:36.740
So we're gonna talk about the mint stuff. We also have a whole bunch of follow-ups including some ZFS things that are actually

02:37.420 --> 02:43.120
pretty exciting a little bit of bumpy news for Ubuntu touches new fancy phone and

02:43.700 --> 02:45.980
many other good things including

02:47.140 --> 02:49.860
including some fun news from the community

02:49.860 --> 02:56.020
So why don't we start there let's bring in that community time appropriate greetings virtual log

03:00.860 --> 03:02.860
Okay, so we have a pretty good showing today

03:03.140 --> 03:05.820
And I know some of you already drinking your beers in there

03:05.820 --> 03:10.500
I want to be I want to first I want to welcome Graham because he made me think of this you reminded me Graham from

03:10.500 --> 03:16.800
Linux voice and from a kick Kickstarter project. We're about to cover Graham welcome to Linux unplugged. Thank you very much

03:16.800 --> 03:22.140
Thanks for having me so tell me about the beer you're drinking on the show today. Um it's a it's a local beer

03:22.140 --> 03:26.420
It's from bath. I'm in Wiltshire in the UK and it used to be called barnstormer

03:26.820 --> 03:32.620
Until they were sued by a company in the US who made a cider even with the beer with the same name

03:32.620 --> 03:34.620
So it's now called Barnsley

03:35.620 --> 03:39.300
Yeah, I still call it barnstormer in the pub. You know that is funny

03:39.300 --> 03:45.840
It's pretty that's pretty appropriate because Wes and I are also drinking a local beer from Washington State where we're based out of called whistling

03:45.840 --> 03:46.740
pig

03:46.740 --> 03:52.500
It's a half of Ison. So yeah, I like it. Ours has got a 4.4 or 5.4 percent alcohol by volume

03:52.580 --> 03:55.620
It's kind of avoid the litigation. I guess with that name. Yeah, right

03:56.060 --> 04:03.260
They have and it says the Northwest original German style craft burr kind of a confused name. I think yeah

04:03.260 --> 04:10.020
That's what it says there, but the Northwest original since 1992 folks. That's like saying you haven't heard

04:11.460 --> 04:13.460
Shakespeare until you've heard in the original Klingon

04:13.460 --> 04:19.220
It is but it's not a bad beer Washington to reinvent the traditional German style. Yeah

04:20.700 --> 04:27.680
Exactly. So, okay. Well Graham, let's get started with something kind of exciting that you guys have going on because it's really we should give

04:27.680 --> 04:34.380
It some attention right away. It's only got a few days left and it's getting close to the finish line. It's beep beep

04:34.780 --> 04:36.780
Yar, what is this?

04:36.780 --> 04:44.860
So, yeah, so we make a magazine we actually crowdfunded at the next magazine and over the last couple of years that we've been doing this

04:44.860 --> 04:49.540
We really wanted to try and experiment with other things we can because we kind of do this on our own

04:50.100 --> 04:54.020
One of the things we always wanted to do was write books for children

04:54.540 --> 05:00.100
I've got kids a couple of us have got kids and I know this has become a bit of a thing now

05:00.100 --> 05:06.540
But we still don't think that anybody's really tackled made computing fun and programming fun. And so we

05:07.540 --> 05:13.020
Kick-started trying to kick-start a project to make a book that hopefully makes programming fun. The book is actually story-driven

05:13.020 --> 05:15.020
It's got pirates and robots in it

05:15.340 --> 05:20.220
and we hope to inadvertently secretly kind of insert bits of

05:20.780 --> 05:27.900
programming law in there without the kids actually having to do any programming in the book itself a little brainwashing is never a bad thing I

05:27.900 --> 05:32.140
In fact, I really love the video. I'm gonna play just a minute of it because I believe it's your daughter

05:32.140 --> 05:37.980
Here's the super cute and I think the best person to introduce this idea is my eight-year-old daughter Eden

05:39.060 --> 05:45.740
This is grace and this is Alan grace and Alan are just like my best friends. They love to learn

05:46.020 --> 05:51.980
They like to push themselves and do cool things and they aren't afraid to try anything new

05:52.380 --> 05:56.500
This is really cool. And I also you know, I remember I was pretty lucky

05:56.500 --> 06:02.980
I when I was young ish, I had a book called how computers work and it was did you ever saw these but it was

06:03.300 --> 06:09.540
Really well illustrated books that helps you break it down visually and just having something that was sort of approachable

06:09.540 --> 06:11.540
That when I did have a little bit of curiosity

06:11.980 --> 06:14.460
Helped me kind of take it further tips, too

06:14.820 --> 06:19.340
Well, that's it. I I had those books with the source code and you remember they were like in the 80s

06:22.020 --> 06:24.020
That's where you're gonna get it from of course

06:24.020 --> 06:27.820
Was that was that input magazine by any chance I

06:29.180 --> 06:34.180
Had a cool news. I had them as my barcode you could scan in with a barcode reader

06:35.220 --> 06:36.980
That's pretty cool

06:36.980 --> 06:43.540
Well, so we got we got just a few days left five days left on the Kickstarter looking for a pledge of total of

06:44.500 --> 06:46.860
28,684 us greenbacks and currently at

06:48.140 --> 06:52.380
16,903 us so if you guys want to check it out go look for bpbr

06:52.380 --> 06:54.300
We'll have a link in the show notes, too

06:54.300 --> 06:55.420
so

06:55.420 --> 06:58.020
Graham anything else we should know about the the effort here

06:58.020 --> 07:03.300
so is this gonna run kind of in long side the same sort of the same production team as Linux voice and sort of

07:03.500 --> 07:08.220
Or since that's sort of like a sub project. How's exactly sort of situated? Well part of part of the money that

07:08.860 --> 07:13.660
We're all really so busy making the magazine part of the money from the kick-starting campaign

07:13.660 --> 07:18.020
But actually go to help us commission out more stuff for the magazine to give us some time to do the book

07:18.020 --> 07:23.540
we're also going to do an interactive part to it so that at the end of each chapter you can actually

07:23.900 --> 07:29.540
With your child if you want to go online and type in bits of code and kind of experiment with the characters in the book

07:29.540 --> 07:31.700
To kind of augment the story in that way

07:31.860 --> 07:35.780
Yeah, the idea is I mean the thing is that print publishing of magazines

07:35.780 --> 07:38.820
It's it's pretty it's a pretty static business and in a way

07:38.820 --> 07:44.940
We're trying to safeguard and kind of look into broaden our horizons a little bit as well. So we thought we'd give it a go

07:44.940 --> 07:50.140
Well, best of luck to you and like you say at the bottom. It's not necessarily just for kids. No

07:51.380 --> 07:55.620
Secretly secretly, it's my fantasy pirates and robots. Yeah, it's a good one

07:56.340 --> 08:00.460
And with a little bit of a software ideology in there. I think it's pretty good

08:00.460 --> 08:02.620
Well, best of luck and hopefully guys go check it out

08:03.780 --> 08:08.720
Thanks. So Graham, you're absolutely welcome to stick around and chat with us during the rest of the show

08:08.720 --> 08:14.380
I had something I wanted to talk about. I saw wimpy on Google Plus saying there's a mutiny afoot

08:14.380 --> 08:18.780
For Ubuntu 1604 and it's it's wimpy now makes news

08:18.940 --> 08:27.000
Apparently when he posts on Google Plus because pretty soon news outlets picked it up and covered mutiny the new unity style desktop layout for Ubuntu

08:27.980 --> 08:34.700
1604 and then I very quickly noticed wimpy take to g-plus trying to make sure everybody understood it wasn't gonna be mandatory

08:34.700 --> 08:37.300
It was just an option. So what is mutiny wimpy?

08:37.300 --> 08:46.020
It's another user interface layout for Ubuntu. Okay, so those of you that been following the project main map may already know that you can

08:47.340 --> 08:52.060
One-click to augment the user interface to look like Windows or Mac OS 10 and

08:52.900 --> 08:59.620
Now we've added a look and feel that is a poor facsimile of unity

08:59.620 --> 09:03.580
It's a functional facsimile. Yeah. Yeah, it does. It does work. Yeah

09:03.580 --> 09:09.780
So it has it has the global the global menu and you have the dock down the side

09:10.540 --> 09:13.500
And it kind of looks and works like unity

09:14.220 --> 09:20.700
But really it's there to sort of showcase some of the new components that have been introduced into Ubuntu

09:20.700 --> 09:26.380
Marte which are there for anyone to use in their panels to create a user interface that suits them

09:26.660 --> 09:30.420
So that global menu can be put on any panel anywhere you'd like

09:30.420 --> 09:37.820
I don't down the side is just an applet that can go into any panel so it can go top bottom left, right

09:37.820 --> 09:42.140
You know, you can align it how you'd like and you can so that whole side panel is an applet

09:43.380 --> 09:48.820
But the panel is a panel and then that the top right the icons are a big happening out there

09:48.820 --> 09:54.140
Yeah, that's that's all in an applet. Okay, the Marte doc applet made by Robin Thompson

09:54.780 --> 09:56.780
He started that about

09:56.780 --> 10:02.300
6-9 months ago and I've been talking with him and I'm actually really pleased. He's at he's actually

10:02.940 --> 10:10.180
Developing within the Ubuntu Marte team now. So whilst we're talking I can see a telegram group going with the Ubuntu Marte

10:10.740 --> 10:12.740
Developers and they're they're feverishly

10:13.700 --> 10:19.500
Working on on new stuff. So yes, it's worked really well and and I like the backdrop as well. Yes

10:19.500 --> 10:23.180
I like that a lot to backdrop from one of the other developers

10:23.180 --> 10:29.500
Yes, I like that a lot to backdrop from one of the Google Plus community members some ghost

10:30.140 --> 10:32.900
67 and he's got a good YouTube channel as well with

10:33.540 --> 10:35.540
distro reviews and insights

10:35.700 --> 10:40.700
So I have had some additional time with Ubuntu Mate

10:41.820 --> 10:49.160
1510 that shipped on the Apollo and I you know every time I use it every single time there

10:49.160 --> 10:56.920
There are just like to this time around it was the fact that VLC was preset up installed as the default audio player

10:56.920 --> 10:58.920
like, you know, it's just

10:59.600 --> 11:03.500
There when I here's the difference for me between Ubuntu Mate and Ubuntu

11:04.920 --> 11:10.680
Legitimately when I'm installing Ubuntu standard 1510 or 1604

11:11.360 --> 11:15.040
It takes me like if I get a machine with Ubuntu 1604 on it

11:15.040 --> 11:20.880
It takes me less time to wipe it and install anti-gross and then from the command line using your word

11:21.120 --> 11:23.000
Install everything I need with one command

11:23.000 --> 11:27.960
It takes me less time to do all of that than it does to set up the Ubuntu installation not the case

11:28.160 --> 11:32.660
with with Ubuntu Mate and it's some of its because of mate tweak Mate tweak and

11:33.240 --> 11:38.720
And you know some of its like the predefined looks that wimpy has or that, you know, the team has put together and

11:39.960 --> 11:42.060
Yeah, it's it is a real feels like a tool

11:42.060 --> 11:43.480
It whatever you want to use it

11:43.480 --> 11:48.100
You just some of the things I just have to do already like for another example is install G

11:48.100 --> 11:52.620
Debye the the graphical G Debye package installer when you download Debs

11:52.620 --> 11:56.920
That's just the best way to install a deb if you want to gooey and it's already set up on a boot to Mate edition

11:57.860 --> 12:00.740
So things like that are always really nice. So 1604

12:01.740 --> 12:04.080
It is looking like a great release

12:04.080 --> 12:10.760
And so I I kind of had a question about this isn't isn't elementary OS also working on a 1604 based

12:10.760 --> 12:14.480
Release and how the hell do you get your hands on something like that? I

12:15.240 --> 12:21.800
Guess there is a way there's instructions for the odd on launchpad to build the Loki ISO

12:21.800 --> 12:25.240
But I think you need to have elementary OS already installed. So if anybody out in the chat room

12:26.120 --> 12:31.560
We're out in the community is up for making me a Loki beta ISO so I could try it out. That would be fun

12:31.560 --> 12:36.200
Yeah, I'm curious to see where they're going to because I haven't checked them out for what I've been thinking a lot about the elementary

12:36.200 --> 12:42.120
OS project recently, right and they're just taking over Geary and yeah, they just took over Geary and have Pantheon mail now

12:42.120 --> 12:44.120
they announced that this week and

12:44.200 --> 12:47.120
I think part of it is because my son has

12:47.560 --> 12:51.940
Been using elementary OS for almost a year now and it's really been flawless

12:51.940 --> 12:55.240
Wow, and I just sat down and used his computer to set up

12:56.520 --> 13:03.180
Some some minecraft mod manager. I can't remember what it's called now and you know, it was just a it's just a clean simple experience

13:03.180 --> 13:05.180
I just I think

13:05.180 --> 13:06.380
I

13:06.380 --> 13:08.380
Don't know. I feel like

13:08.660 --> 13:12.740
Maybe maybe it's worth another look. I've been I've been following on 1604 hotness

13:12.740 --> 13:13.060
Yeah

13:13.060 --> 13:16.860
So if somebody out there want to make me an ISO because they if they have elementary OS installed and follow the instructions

13:16.860 --> 13:18.700
I'd be curious because I don't have elementary

13:18.700 --> 13:23.820
installed speaking of some of our favorite distros just a real quick shout out to Antigros Antegoros and

13:24.420 --> 13:30.780
What what do you say Wes? Hmm Antigros? Yeah, let's go with Antigros. Guess what Wes ZFS support out of the box

13:30.780 --> 13:35.240
Whoa install they've redone their installer a whole bunch of new stuff. They're moving this over to stable

13:35.860 --> 13:41.840
Wow, look at all those downloads who 52,000 384 downloads for since she's 0.12

13:43.340 --> 13:46.820
It's interesting how they're almost focusing more on the installer than they are the distro itself

13:47.500 --> 13:52.140
Since she's 0.14 development 148 days of developments 510 commits

13:52.580 --> 13:55.540
46 bugs squashed look at the new installer there Wow

13:55.540 --> 14:01.860
0.16 is looking real smooth and one of the new features is built-in ZFS support

14:02.460 --> 14:04.140
You can install now

14:04.140 --> 14:06.140
with ZFS work. Go ahead

14:06.820 --> 14:08.420
Antegos is

14:08.420 --> 14:13.540
Basically 90% essentially installer anyway. Yeah, I really it's good. Yeah, it really is

14:13.540 --> 14:17.200
That's why I think it's actually kind of smart that they do this because otherwise it's essentially arch

14:18.820 --> 14:23.820
Yeah, so I don't know I think that's pretty neat so they've obviously moved after Ubuntu made the news

14:23.820 --> 14:28.980
But they must have been working on this already. Yeah, I would I would think so at least yeah, so this is cool

14:28.980 --> 14:30.980
I think we're gonna have it you're gonna have in 1604

14:31.660 --> 14:35.780
Which I guess would mean that Ubuntu Mate 1604 is gonna have ZFS support too

14:35.780 --> 14:39.700
When is that gonna be available to me in any way if I do a installation?

14:40.460 --> 14:44.220
What ZFS on Ubuntu Mate on the 1604 version?

14:44.620 --> 14:48.300
Yeah, in just the same way it will be available on any Ubuntu flavor

14:48.300 --> 14:55.500
All of the ZFS stuff is gonna be in the official archives, but that's not in the installer though, right? I don't think it's going to be in

14:56.180 --> 15:01.380
Ubiquity now at least I've seen no evidence of that so far. Yeah, and we're in feature freeze now

15:01.380 --> 15:04.360
so unless they do a feature freeze exception, I don't know but

15:05.660 --> 15:10.460
I imagine it. Well, I don't know. Yeah, are you feeling good?

15:10.460 --> 15:15.600
Maybe maybe if you use the minimal ISO, you know, you'd have to do a bit of fiddling you could use the minimal ISO

15:15.600 --> 15:22.360
You know install that on the ZFS and then yeah install the right package for the desktop of your choice

15:23.720 --> 15:27.680
I'm not thinking it's time to move your root file system over to ZFS

15:27.720 --> 15:33.120
You could maybe make the argument for home or like a data partition, which you would set up maybe after installation anyways

15:33.120 --> 15:35.980
But after your root partition or boot even

15:36.640 --> 15:39.520
I'm not sure I'm ready to make that case yet. And if you are

15:39.520 --> 15:45.720
You're gonna set up manually yourself. I'm not sure grub supports ZFS. So I don't think it could be used as um

15:45.720 --> 15:49.200
Well, I guess you could just fun. He's a BSD has even better

15:50.560 --> 15:55.240
Just fine. I've been using it for a long time. Oh, it does. How long is a long time?

15:55.920 --> 16:01.760
I've been using it for two years at least a really well like a git version of like I like a fortune

16:01.760 --> 16:05.640
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No. No, you definitely use a git version of grub, but you probably already are because

16:05.640 --> 16:07.640
Yeah

16:08.440 --> 16:11.160
That's true most distros are using a git check out

16:11.160 --> 16:16.200
The question is does it support all the new features if you use less features than the latest you're probably okay

16:16.840 --> 16:20.400
But if you're using a new grub, you're okay regardless. They support all the ZFS features

16:20.400 --> 16:24.560
So are you saying you've been you've been booting off ZFS for two years?

16:25.440 --> 16:26.680
Yes

16:26.680 --> 16:30.120
Well, there you go. Even with slash boot even slash boot on ZFS

16:30.120 --> 16:36.400
Oh, really and and how do you feel like performance overhead is for something like that? It's not bad. I

16:38.720 --> 16:43.320
Wouldn't say you really notice very much. I mean I have a lot of RAM on my machines, so I'm not yeah

16:44.040 --> 16:47.440
Okay. Well see that's that's me. That's interesting to me. That is interesting

16:47.800 --> 16:51.480
And I know their work. They've just recently started working on it on BSD

16:51.480 --> 16:56.760
So that's why I just didn't feel like I had a lot of testing right and it's another level if you expect any user

16:56.760 --> 16:59.480
Who can use the installer to understand the file system?

16:59.480 --> 17:04.480
So I feel like there's an argument there even if it works great. Yeah, huh? Well, look at that everybody

17:04.480 --> 17:08.960
It's it's interesting 16 is the future. Yeah, it's the year of the Linux desktop

17:08.960 --> 17:14.560
It is just depends on who you ask and what what desktop they're using. Yeah, I'm curious

17:14.560 --> 17:16.800
I'm curious to see where elementary OS is going. I want to try that out

17:16.800 --> 17:23.160
What what I agree with the kernel panic here computers have plenty of memory and CPU cycles. Yeah, that's well

17:23.160 --> 17:26.760
I don't know. I don't know if I agree I could always use more

17:26.760 --> 17:30.520
You know what else I could always use more of a good deal everybody do me a favor

17:30.520 --> 17:33.560
Go check out ting linux ting comms the first sponsor this week

17:34.000 --> 17:36.680
This is mobile. That really does make sense. In fact if

17:37.280 --> 17:39.020
Aliens came to earth

17:39.020 --> 17:42.920
They would look at all the other guys and they'd be like what the hell is the matter with you?

17:42.920 --> 17:45.120
What are you doing? Why are you doing it that way?

17:46.160 --> 17:50.040
And then they'd look at ting and go okay, and it's not just Kyra. They'd look at ting and they go

17:50.040 --> 17:53.200
Oh that makes sense. That's how you should do it ting keeps rates simple

17:53.200 --> 17:58.120
We don't make you pick a plan instead. You just use your phone as you normally would how much you use

17:58.560 --> 18:02.960
Determines how much you pay each month. You can have as many devices as you want on one account

18:03.120 --> 18:03.920
That's good

18:03.920 --> 18:08.120
Because when you use more you pay less per minute message or megabyte of data

18:08.360 --> 18:13.320
Your usage plus six dollars per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill

18:14.060 --> 18:16.300
Simple that's what we mean when we say

18:16.300 --> 18:23.300
Mobile that makes sense. So not only can you save earth from an alien invasion because they're pissed off about our mobile practices

18:23.300 --> 18:26.620
By going to linux.ting.com, but you get $25 off a device

18:26.620 --> 18:31.900
You get $25 in service credits if you have a compatible device and they have GSM and CDMA

18:31.900 --> 18:37.500
So you just might moto II second-gen 99 bucks unlocked. No contract. Yeah

18:38.180 --> 18:44.380
Yeah, they also have the tribute to which is a nice LG phone running Android. They got the Apple Internet phones

18:44.380 --> 18:48.620
You know if you want to fight the FBI about those before. Yeah, here's a good one

18:48.620 --> 18:53.140
I think this is like this this is this is the one I think I mean if you don't need like the

18:53.140 --> 18:57.100
S6 or s7 or you don't need a nexus because they got the nexus is too. Yep

18:58.100 --> 19:04.300
LG volt to 5-inch display tri-band LTE lollipop 5.1 show probably get an upgrade though

19:05.100 --> 19:12.180
Yeah, but look at that's a nice phone. Of course lollipops not bad really 183 dollars. No contract nor the termination fee. That's nuts

19:12.180 --> 19:17.660
LG's nexus 5 the og nexus 5 still in my pocket 215 bucks. Wow

19:19.060 --> 19:23.540
Yeah, I know that's a really great phone still that is a really great phone the aqueous crystal

19:23.540 --> 19:29.500
That's pretty nice the one plus one 290 or yeah 299 unlocked moto x they got all the great phones, right?

19:29.500 --> 19:35.020
And they also have just the sim cards go over to linux.ting.com to support the show and while you're there

19:36.100 --> 19:41.740
Do the savings calculator. That's fun. Do the same. Oh, yeah, kits and points. Yeah, that's a nice phone

19:41.740 --> 19:44.340
Kitson points out that you could put cyanogen on that. That's true

19:44.340 --> 19:47.520
You could put cyanogen on that volt shoot puts put cyanogen on that

19:47.520 --> 19:50.280
You know ting has a really great community on reddit on their forums

19:50.280 --> 19:52.700
They post YouTube videos where you can interact with them

19:52.700 --> 19:57.940
The reason I bring this up is they're not gonna shame you if you want to put a some weird thing on your phone

19:58.020 --> 20:01.340
Like they just want you to use their network and you know be a customer

20:01.340 --> 20:04.020
I they won't not give you support because you did something different

20:04.020 --> 20:08.000
No, I was straight up when I was trying out a boon to touch on ting. I was straight up honest with them

20:08.000 --> 20:10.100
Yeah, I'm running a boon to touch and they're like, oh, that's awesome

20:10.100 --> 20:14.800
Will you give us feedback on how that works on a network because we're watching that that was their response not

20:15.220 --> 20:17.740
That's not an authorized phone operating system

20:17.740 --> 20:20.900
But you're on violation of your terms of service like that's what they could have said, right?

20:20.940 --> 20:23.940
No, they didn't say that linux.ting.com go there

20:24.700 --> 20:28.100
Support the show and a big. Thank you to ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged show

20:29.020 --> 20:31.020
speaking of mobile devices

20:31.460 --> 20:33.620
Mobile World Congress. Yeah, right now I'm not going on

20:34.620 --> 20:36.620
This talks about it's the only thing in

20:36.620 --> 20:42.100
In Barcelona, they have a fancy new phone over there at the Ubuntu booth that people have been checking out

20:42.100 --> 20:44.680
I've been watching some videos of hands-on demos of it

20:45.740 --> 20:49.220
And in fact, I posted in the chat room. I should probably go grab it real quick

20:49.220 --> 20:54.380
But anyways people been looking at this new Mizzou Pro 5 and the verse says

20:54.860 --> 21:00.360
Not good enough the verge talks about it being laggy the verge talks about it not responding to some interfaces

21:00.360 --> 21:06.140
There's a good hardware design they say but they're worried that it's just too darn laggy

21:06.140 --> 21:09.500
And I I think for you and I West that's kind of a big deal. Don't you think?

21:10.940 --> 21:13.180
Your thoughts after you read something like this is

21:13.700 --> 21:18.580
Is this just an issue because it's a pre-release phone or do you think this is something on a bigger picture level?

21:18.580 --> 21:19.260
I don't know

21:19.260 --> 21:22.580
It's hard to say I think I think there is a lot with the pre-release that you know

21:22.580 --> 21:26.100
The fact that it runs that you've still got who punt you you've got you know

21:26.140 --> 21:30.420
Real Linux right there on the phone a good-looking phone. The hardware looks nice. Yes. I think that's a lot

21:30.420 --> 21:34.900
The hardware looks very nice and I'm gonna say Samsung's it's got one of Samsung's nice processors

21:34.900 --> 21:37.900
Any know like a really good processor, right? It's got a really good camera in it

21:37.900 --> 21:41.360
And I do think that there's probably a significant amount of you know

21:42.660 --> 21:48.820
Optimization for touch for quick response times rather than throughput kind of stuff that you see especially on real Linux

21:48.820 --> 21:51.060
So I'm sure there's a lot of tunables. I'm hopeful

21:51.580 --> 21:54.620
Probably really curious to see when you know the final production models roll out

21:54.620 --> 21:54.940
All right

21:54.940 --> 21:58.060
So here's what I'm really looking forward to and this is where I'm willing to give it some

21:58.060 --> 22:03.600
I mean, I'm really really sensitive to lag but XTA developers have a video of convergence in action

22:03.600 --> 22:06.700
Here we go actual real-world original stuff from Ubuntu phone

22:07.460 --> 22:12.780
It's getting better. It's getting more refined, but that's not the exciting thing. I'm going to show you the exciting thing

22:12.780 --> 22:19.140
I'm going to show you is convergence. We've now connected the phone to a monitor and it's automatically switched into windowed mode

22:19.300 --> 22:22.220
So we've got the full Ubuntu desktop here

22:22.940 --> 22:26.940
One of the new things we've got is the switcher. So I push into the right edge

22:27.420 --> 22:31.980
And I can select an application and here you see Libre office

22:31.980 --> 22:35.540
And this is running so any app that can run on Linux

22:36.060 --> 22:38.640
Will run on this well arm Linux

22:39.700 --> 22:46.820
Another nice feature we have is when you switch from phone onto the desktop a hundred percent of status preserved

22:49.260 --> 22:51.420
That's kind of nice right that's really nice

22:51.420 --> 22:55.260
No, I want that right now that sort of changes my opinion on it a little bit

22:55.260 --> 22:59.300
I know anybody in the chat room have any thoughts on Ubuntu touch or is actually using it right now

22:59.300 --> 23:03.820
I'd love to hear from somebody who's been actively on it. I know wouldn't be weren't you trying it for a bit? I

23:05.140 --> 23:07.140
Yeah, I've been using it for a while and

23:07.740 --> 23:09.740
Later this year. I'm gonna

23:09.800 --> 23:15.100
Have an extended period period where Ubuntu for devices is the only thing I use

23:16.300 --> 23:20.980
So the verge really really panned the experience the verge seemed very dissatisfied in the article

23:20.980 --> 23:25.940
They published today from Mobile World Congress. Do you have any kind of was that to do with them they?

23:27.220 --> 23:28.740
the

23:28.740 --> 23:33.500
Into user interface and the phone operating system or more the hardware. Well, I

23:34.460 --> 23:40.220
You know, I mean it's on this. It's on this mu as profile that it has the snapdragon processor in it

23:40.220 --> 23:42.220
You know, it's supposed to be pretty good hardware

23:47.260 --> 23:53.300
Yeah, I don't know I don't know if they're Apple buys or not and when the last meizu device

23:53.900 --> 23:55.900
Shipped with Ubuntu it

23:55.900 --> 23:57.700
It

23:57.700 --> 24:05.480
Took a couple of revs to iron out, you know, some of the kinks they I seem to have had some difficulty

24:06.580 --> 24:10.680
You know getting all working smoothly. So maybe it's just you know, yeah

24:11.240 --> 24:15.460
Yeah, and my accident in the Mamba room. You've been running it for a bit. What are your impressions?

24:16.420 --> 24:18.660
I've been playing around with it. I've been trying to

24:19.540 --> 24:24.100
trying to get it in a state where it does all things I'm doing with Android and I find

24:24.100 --> 24:30.060
The the I really like the system and I really like the the sort of I don't want to use the word paradigms

24:30.060 --> 24:30.980
Because it sounds rubbish

24:30.980 --> 24:38.060
But you know the the the style they're going for with the swiping from the edges and and the general feel of the system

24:38.060 --> 24:42.700
I really like it. But when I come to try and use the apps, I find that there's you know

24:43.180 --> 24:48.820
If they're just not mature like the ones I'm using on Android are that's where it really falls down for me at the moment

24:48.820 --> 24:50.860
I don't have the features which I just think oh

24:50.860 --> 24:56.280
a pod catcher will have this or an audio book player will have this and then I go looking for them and

24:56.380 --> 24:59.220
There's just they're missing that that feature that I use all the time

25:00.140 --> 25:06.620
So this chicken and egg problem for sure and the mu s5 pro looks really really nice

25:06.740 --> 25:12.660
Like I think it even has like a super high-end. I even be 20 something megapixel camera. I got really high-end camera

25:14.020 --> 25:17.000
USB-c charging there. It looks like is that USB-c or mini? It looks like you

25:17.000 --> 25:21.320
Use to be see it kind of looks like an iPhone to be honest. Yes, it does. It does but

25:22.040 --> 25:25.640
Linux on your iPhone. Hey, that doesn't sound bad wide power button on the side

25:25.640 --> 25:27.640
Oh, wow, look they have actually have it right there next to an iPhone

25:30.040 --> 25:32.040
Yeah, so

25:32.640 --> 25:38.280
Yeah, we'll see huh? We'll say meizu meizu not my zoo meizu. Thank you. Oh

25:39.000 --> 25:46.720
Yes, wimpy. Tell me about the UK that you that is right the UI usability study that we'd mentioned you ended up participating in it

25:46.720 --> 25:48.720
Do you have anything to share about that?

25:49.520 --> 25:52.520
Well, yes, I was actually the first person to

25:54.400 --> 25:56.080
Participate in that

25:56.080 --> 25:59.880
Usability. Wow, that was a week and a half ago. I think I was there

26:00.800 --> 26:07.440
So I'm not gonna go into too much detail because I'd be stealing show content from upcoming Ubuntu podcast

26:08.940 --> 26:14.120
But I suppose I suppose the thing to take away from that is that

26:14.120 --> 26:19.240
they are actually looking at the user experience of the phone and

26:19.640 --> 26:25.560
The applications and not just the core apps that are being developed by canonical

26:25.560 --> 26:30.440
But also some of the community contributed apps. So there is an effort to you know, try and

26:31.080 --> 26:32.080
improve

26:32.080 --> 26:34.080
the the

26:34.720 --> 26:39.480
User experience across the board and did you say would you say why you were there that you witnessed?

26:39.480 --> 26:45.160
Somebody giving pushback saying this doesn't make sense and then being receptive to that pushback

26:46.160 --> 26:52.440
Absolutely. Oh, that's good to hear. Okay, you know, that's that goes a long way and then they can also say, you know

26:52.440 --> 26:54.440
We've tested this

26:56.640 --> 26:58.400
Speaking of testing

26:58.400 --> 27:03.700
Wow, 100 million users are testing the hell out of telegram and I bring this up on Linux unplugged because

27:03.700 --> 27:09.220
The secret is this is like one of the number one messaging apps now on Linux

27:09.220 --> 27:15.860
Mm-hmm is telegram freaking telegram and you were looking at at a telegram alternative. Do you remember what that was called?

27:15.860 --> 27:22.020
It was like an open source. I think you put it probably in our message thread. I believe I did they say check this out

27:22.980 --> 27:26.460
Telegram now has 100 million monthly active users

27:27.940 --> 27:31.500
350,000 news your sign up each freaking day and they are delivering

27:31.500 --> 27:38.580
15 billion messages Wow daily 15 billion. That is that is really nuts

27:40.180 --> 27:45.580
Yeah, and and it really has undoubtedly become one of the largest one of the largest Linux messaging programs

27:45.580 --> 27:49.300
Did you find it there with just about it waiting for slack? Oh, jeez

27:49.460 --> 27:51.460
That's what you get for not using matter most West

27:51.460 --> 27:56.620
I know after that big that low latency maybe on some sort of server that do you think it would you think it would be

27:56.620 --> 28:00.160
Faster is that is that a thing because you know, I could always use faster

28:00.160 --> 28:01.620
That is something I could take

28:01.620 --> 28:08.380
So anyways West had found a project that looks like it may have some relation to actor. I am actor

28:08.380 --> 28:14.460
Yes, okay actor. I am and it looks like what West this has some relation to the telegram folks

28:14.460 --> 28:18.220
Yeah, I believe it's being worked on at least by some people formerly associated with the telegram project

28:18.940 --> 28:24.940
It's free secure photo and voice messages all under an Apache 2 license and they're talking about it

28:24.940 --> 28:30.500
I believe so I have not verified that myself and they're talking about integrating signals protocol

28:30.500 --> 28:34.920
Which I know a lot of people have spoken good things about it looks just like telegram. It really does

28:35.420 --> 28:36.640
Huh, that's interesting

28:36.640 --> 28:40.460
So if it has the same performance and maybe a better or more open back end

28:40.460 --> 28:45.260
That would be interesting because one of my favorite things about telegram is it really just works. The question is is what?

28:45.860 --> 28:47.700
what

28:47.700 --> 28:54.900
Encryption. Yes, are they using daredevil and you know a quick trick to see how many users are actively on telegram at any given time

28:54.900 --> 28:56.900
What's that? I

28:58.140 --> 29:00.140
Don't hear you I do not sorry. Yes

29:00.780 --> 29:01.820
Yes

29:01.820 --> 29:05.700
The trick the trick is they use in at least an Android phones

29:05.700 --> 29:11.360
They use the accounts and when you're going to your contacts app and you're going to export your contacts

29:11.380 --> 29:14.860
It shows telegram as an option even though it will not export them

29:14.860 --> 29:20.240
It will show the number of actual users registered in telegram. Yeah. Oh, ah

29:20.240 --> 29:27.520
Interesting good catch. I also by the way just one more thing before we get off the telegram topic

29:27.520 --> 29:32.800
I gave a quick mention during last that I was impressed that the linux mint project was communicating

29:33.440 --> 29:38.880
Via the tub, there's a there's a group I subscribe to on telegram with security alert notifications

29:38.880 --> 29:43.080
And I thought maybe I'd share that with the rest of you since I've gotten some questions about hey

29:43.080 --> 29:47.040
What group did you subscribe to to to get those those alerts?

29:47.040 --> 29:52.040
So let's see. It's a if you go to telegram me slash it sec alert

29:53.040 --> 29:57.840
this subscribes you to a telegram group that is essentially a read-only group of

29:59.640 --> 30:03.280
Well IT security alerts Wow, so like when Linux make got hacked

30:03.280 --> 30:08.000
This was one of the first place and since then there's been like 18 other projects that have been hacked and there's been a notification

30:08.400 --> 30:13.000
That's been posted on this telegram group. And so it's kind of a neat thing. I'll put a link in the chat room

30:13.000 --> 30:18.840
And so this was one of the ways I found out about Linux mint being hacked over the weekend was by this group again

30:18.840 --> 30:24.960
That's telegram me slash it sec alert and you know what? I'll throw a link in the show notes, too

30:24.960 --> 30:30.920
So that way if you guys you guys want to cover that mumble or many other thoughts on the telegram or open source chat or secure

30:30.920 --> 30:32.920
chat before we move on I

30:32.920 --> 30:36.620
Just hope they finally get the back end free software, too

30:36.620 --> 30:37.000
Yeah

30:37.000 --> 30:43.800
That would be the big difference if actor has the the full client is open source like the back end is there they have a server

30:43.800 --> 30:47.320
Pulled her in there. I like that. I like that. I think that's a good thing

30:48.720 --> 30:49.880
Yeah

30:49.880 --> 30:57.800
Yeah, yes, we did EKS we did EKS just joins the chat room. Hold on. Hold on just for EKS standby. I'm standby. This is

31:00.680 --> 31:01.640
Yes

31:01.640 --> 31:08.400
EKS we have reported that Anna gross is integrating ZFS in their installer but just reconfirming if you're just joining us live now on

31:08.400 --> 31:11.880
The jblive.tv stream. It has been confirmed ZFS support has been added

31:12.560 --> 31:16.120
Knowing Chris he will be reinstalling his machine right before the show next week

31:17.480 --> 31:21.360
That's so stay tuned that is very possible. All right, so Linux mint

31:21.920 --> 31:26.380
They got compromised over the weekend Clem took to the Linux mint blog and said hey

31:26.380 --> 31:29.400
I've shut down the servers where this is happening at. Oh, by the way

31:29.400 --> 31:35.480
Clem you're also your forum server god. Oh, okay. I'm gonna shut that server down. Okay now we have shut this server down

31:35.480 --> 31:41.140
Oh, yeah, they replaced the MD five sums. Don't pay attention to the MD five sums. You download use these MD five sums. Oh

31:42.040 --> 31:47.640
Boy, this just started getting out of control and shortly after that you started seeing everybody talking about it by Sunday afternoon

31:48.160 --> 31:51.440
Everybody was talking about it. Uncle Leo was talking about it on Twitter

31:51.440 --> 31:54.620
Oh dear Leo ed bot was taking shots at mint

31:54.620 --> 31:59.940
Exaggerating the scope of the flaws ZD net got an exclusive interview with the attacker

32:00.740 --> 32:03.700
And got all the details. We're gonna talk about all of that

32:04.380 --> 32:07.700
And and we're not gonna sit here and rub Linux mint in the ground

32:07.700 --> 32:12.060
It's more about it's really more about the meta discussion that needs to happen here

32:12.060 --> 32:18.660
And maybe maybe towards the end if we could bring the discussion to a place and say where we can maybe answer the question

32:18.660 --> 32:24.460
What could be done as a community to solve the problem of verifying the source and identity of an ISO?

32:24.460 --> 32:29.540
And I know there's a lot of different ways we can accomplish this you can have you can have lots of different signatures

32:29.540 --> 32:33.540
You can have there's MD five sums today all these things exist. But what if there was?

32:34.180 --> 32:41.260
Maybe something centralized maybe it's distributed like through a blockchain some way to verify the identity identity of files

32:42.660 --> 32:47.860
That was reliable and distributed. Oh, man, that could be pretty cool. So let's start talking about mint

32:47.860 --> 32:50.740
What's happened since the Linux action show on Sunday?

32:50.740 --> 32:57.540
and then maybe we can sort of end up with that bigger conversation about what could be a really cool long-term solution to this problem and

32:57.780 --> 33:03.500
Maybe you'd host that solution to this problem that long-term so I know where I would a digital ocean droplet West

33:03.500 --> 33:08.700
Come on, don't fool around use the promo code deal unplugged and get a $10 credit over a digital ocean com

33:08.700 --> 33:14.020
It's a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering most intuitive and easy way for you get a super badass Linux rig in no time

33:14.020 --> 33:18.400
They have all Linux machines run on KVM virtualizer with SSDs for the disk

33:18.400 --> 33:21.660
IO you can get started less than 55 seconds and pricing plan start Oh

33:22.460 --> 33:28.220
Five dollars a month five a month. That's right. Get your 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSDs

33:28.780 --> 33:34.660
Because they're all SSDs a CPU that's super fast a terabyte of transfer and moa

33:34.660 --> 33:40.900
Oh, what's more you ask their crazy great interface and super straightforward API that interface man

33:40.900 --> 33:42.900
That is an innovation of humanity

33:42.900 --> 33:47.740
Managing virtual machines with an interface like this. It's ridiculous. It should be illegal

33:47.740 --> 33:52.460
It's so awesome. If the US government knew they'd be taxing them on their on their innovation

33:52.460 --> 33:59.220
I'll tell you what else digital ocean supplies the back-end hosting for tons of open source projects that we know we love and we download

33:59.220 --> 34:01.220
from every single day not to mention

34:02.380 --> 34:05.780
The very mumble room we're talking to our virtual love no way. That's right

34:06.300 --> 34:10.340
Digital oceans your place to go to spin up a Linux infrastructure when you need it. They got Debian's

34:10.340 --> 34:13.900
They got the core OS is they got the fedoras the Ubuntu's

34:14.980 --> 34:18.120
They've even got no free BSD

34:19.260 --> 34:23.140
That's true. That's true. They have great tutorials to help you really take it up a notch

34:23.140 --> 34:25.040
So, you know what you can look like a boost

34:25.040 --> 34:30.740
They make it easy to take backups move them around wipe them and start over again when you screw something up real bad because you

34:30.740 --> 34:34.940
Know you will that's what it's all about. And what I love about the pricing is it's

34:35.840 --> 34:36.660
hourly

34:36.660 --> 34:41.420
So you could really just go spin up a rig for like a few hours and try something cray-cray see if it goes

34:41.420 --> 34:45.020
And if it don't go blow it away and if a go-go you keep it

34:45.220 --> 34:48.100
Then we use I know and when you use the promo code deal unplugged

34:48.180 --> 34:50.660
The decisions made for you because you get the $10 credits

34:51.060 --> 34:56.220
You can go create your virtual server infrastructure on demand in less than 55 seconds for free for two months

34:56.980 --> 35:02.100
Now if that's not boss mode, I don't know what is digital ocean comm and a big. Thank you to digital ocean

35:02.100 --> 35:05.300
For sponsoring Linux unplugged

35:06.740 --> 35:08.180
Okay

35:08.180 --> 35:12.500
Before we get into the Linux mint story

35:12.500 --> 35:17.500
I thought I would read a little bit from the CD net article and then I'll open up to the mumble room to kind of

35:17.500 --> 35:19.500
Jump in but the hacker

35:20.060 --> 35:25.220
Known as peace had a nice chitchat with that was Zach white talker

35:25.860 --> 35:30.140
Or white taker Whitaker. Oh, I like my version a lot better West

35:30.140 --> 35:35.660
Thanks that Zach white taker. He taker of white men. He comes in and he talks about

35:36.220 --> 35:40.180
What this guy did to Linux mint and I don't understand

35:41.180 --> 35:48.620
Zach apparently writes for security websites, but yet he talks about Linux like somebody who's never heard of it before but anyways

35:49.380 --> 35:52.940
So the hacker responsible who goes by the name of peace told me in an encrypted chat

35:53.780 --> 35:58.140
Probably telegram on Sunday that a few hundred Linux mint installs

35:58.140 --> 36:04.580
Remained under their control a significant portion of the thousand-plus downloads during the day. Wow. How about that, huh?

36:05.100 --> 36:12.140
Peace also claimed to have stolen an entire copy of the site's form not once but twice friends once on January 28th

36:12.140 --> 36:18.140
Happy birthday, Chris. Mine was my birthday 26, but yeah and February 18th two days before the hack was confirmed

36:18.140 --> 36:25.780
The hacker shared a portion of the form dump, which we verified to contain some personal identifiable info like birthdays profile pictures

36:25.780 --> 36:27.780
passwords emails

36:28.780 --> 36:32.380
those passwords also might not stay for very stay safe for very long because

36:33.380 --> 36:37.740
Clem was using PHP pass to hash the passwords which has known flaws

36:38.260 --> 36:42.900
It later emerged that the hacker had placed the full form dump on a dark web marketplace

36:43.540 --> 36:48.660
Which that's what you do. Yeah, which he wanted, you know 85 bucks cuz well he needed 85 bucks

36:48.660 --> 36:53.100
So he asked for it in Bitcoin peace was just jokey or I'm sorry poking around

36:53.100 --> 36:58.580
The site in January when he found or say they found a vulnerability granting unauthorized access

36:58.900 --> 37:03.620
The hacker also said they used credentials to log into the site's admin panel as Clem

37:04.340 --> 37:06.340
But we're reluctant to explain how

37:06.860 --> 37:11.340
It provided useful later on I could think of a few ways though on Saturday

37:11.340 --> 37:14.420
The hacker replaced one of the 64-bit Linux distribution images

37:14.420 --> 37:19.940
That's an ISO for those of you at home with one that was modified by adding a back door and later

37:19.940 --> 37:26.020
Decided to replace all the mirrors for every downloadable version with the Linux on the site with their own version aka

37:26.500 --> 37:33.060
Altered the site links to point to their versions the backdoor version isn't as difficult as you'd think piece in because oh, no

37:33.060 --> 37:37.380
That's right. This is one of the things the author just threw in here. This is not a quote

37:38.020 --> 37:41.180
From the hacker. This is a quote from

37:42.300 --> 37:44.300
Zach Whitetaker here

37:44.820 --> 37:46.820
Zach Whitetaker adds

37:46.820 --> 37:53.140
The backdoor version isn't as difficult as you'd think because the code is open-source the hacker said it just took a few hours

37:53.140 --> 37:57.460
To repack Linux that contained the backdoor. What does that have to do with being open-source?

37:57.460 --> 38:02.740
It just means it's easy to do those closed source ISO files Chris. Yeah, I can't touch them

38:02.740 --> 38:07.020
I just like this and this guy's like it's supposed to be a like a journalist that writes on this stuff all the time

38:07.020 --> 38:13.580
Anyways, the hacker used their access to change legitimate checksums and used and which people then download to verify the integrity

38:13.580 --> 38:17.860
checksums checked out peace said the first hacking episode start in late January, but peaked when

38:18.180 --> 38:21.100
They started spreading the backdoor images early Saturday morning

38:22.140 --> 38:26.700
They had no specific goal to their attack, but peace said that their motivation was essentially to build a botnet

38:27.940 --> 38:31.180
Using this anomaly bit malware that we talked about in Linux action show

38:31.940 --> 38:34.220
For now the hackers motive was just having access in general

38:34.220 --> 38:40.100
But they did not rule out using the body to carry out data mining or many other nefarious means in the meantime the hackers botnet

38:40.100 --> 38:46.660
Is still up and running, but the number of infected machines has dropped significantly since the news broke on Saturday

38:47.940 --> 38:52.620
Peace confirmed Clem decided not to respond for comment to the article

38:55.580 --> 39:02.380
Okay, dare Devlin so you think it's not a big deal at all not a big deal at all. Tell me why so I will say

39:02.380 --> 39:06.100
Not a big deal at all because in one if criminal.org

39:06.100 --> 39:10.980
was able to be at the our target and existence of much simpler less

39:11.740 --> 39:13.020
feature

39:13.020 --> 39:14.820
oriented website

39:14.820 --> 39:21.500
Yes, it's okay to understand that the project like Linux Mint could be infected actually any project has

39:23.900 --> 39:29.860
That same issue in the sense of there is a likelihood of having you know being a target

39:29.860 --> 39:31.860
So this is number one or two

39:31.860 --> 39:38.300
Most people how that use the the Linux Mint already have it installed. They're probably upgrading their packages

39:39.100 --> 39:43.780
Which also means that if you already have it installed in your district properly roles

39:43.780 --> 39:47.580
Which is usually something that Linux mix tends to do somewhat decently

39:48.140 --> 39:50.140
We're not downloading as often

39:52.860 --> 39:57.180
So they say thousands of people download the ISO they say a few hundred are still running the botnet

39:57.180 --> 40:03.660
Yeah, a few hundred are still running the button at those thousands that downloaded like how many times have you downloaded because you couldn't find

40:03.660 --> 40:05.660
That CD just out of laziness

40:05.700 --> 40:07.700
I've downloaded

40:08.380 --> 40:13.980
Yeah, out of laziness. You couldn't find that CD or that USB stick or that I so you did that. Yeah, I

40:14.980 --> 40:16.780
That's not really

40:16.780 --> 40:21.740
Okay, that's critical. I wouldn't call it critical for the amount of users living to me that has so Swift

40:21.740 --> 40:25.780
You also think it's critical for the amount of users living to me that has so Swift

40:25.780 --> 40:30.260
You also think this has sort of been blown out of proportion. It's not really good to go after Linux Mint

40:30.940 --> 40:34.460
Yes, it's bad for the community in general. I mean we need to

40:35.140 --> 40:38.700
Really look at this as being an opportunity. Yes to make improvements

40:38.700 --> 40:41.780
But overall it's gonna be beneficial for the whole community

40:41.780 --> 40:48.060
They're gonna see areas where their weaknesses and then patch those things and just do better and better over time, you know

40:48.420 --> 40:52.340
Patrolling different channels about Linux and saying Linux Mint sucks

40:52.340 --> 40:58.020
That's not gonna help anything and it makes me question a person's you know, really intent intentions

40:58.020 --> 41:00.220
So I gotta tell you guys

41:00.940 --> 41:03.860
I've definitely noticed they that the dogs are out

41:03.860 --> 41:04.300
Yeah

41:04.300 --> 41:08.900
And what's what's really kind of impressive about it is the dogs are out

41:09.260 --> 41:13.140
Inside the Linux community and they're going after Linux Mint and Clem

41:13.420 --> 41:17.940
most of it seems to be a bunch of cranky package maintainers who like are from Debbie and who've had like

41:18.260 --> 41:20.480
Package name namespace issues and things like that

41:20.480 --> 41:24.260
But there are a lot of people that are very upset pointing out a multitude of issues

41:25.100 --> 41:26.780
Rodden corpse. What do you think?

41:26.780 --> 41:27.020
I mean

41:27.020 --> 41:32.100
Do you think this part of the reason why this is getting as much attention is because there are outstanding issues or with Linux Mint that

41:32.180 --> 41:35.380
People still argue. Well, this is just another example of the overall problem

41:36.340 --> 41:39.540
Yeah, there's like that you mentioned the package manager issues

41:39.540 --> 41:45.780
I mean the namespace is a problem the priority control is a problem the fact that they you mean for the kernel updates

41:45.780 --> 41:50.180
Oh dad their kernel base, but they have priority controls over their own packages

41:50.180 --> 41:56.340
so if they have a package that is in your as in their repo and is updated in Ubuntu and

41:57.140 --> 42:03.340
Linux Mint doesn't change that and doesn't you know recognize that the thing has been updated. You're not gonna get that update and

42:03.980 --> 42:06.660
That's nothing to do with whether you have the same package or not

42:06.660 --> 42:10.340
It's just they have a priority that is much higher than anything else

42:10.340 --> 42:16.860
So even if you install a PPA sometimes the mint priority just overtakes it and you cannot get it installed unless you manually force it

42:16.860 --> 42:23.180
So there's like weird little bugs like that that men is done that are like legitimate problems

42:23.260 --> 42:27.700
But this overhyped thing about you know, they're it being insecure is

42:28.460 --> 42:33.420
Just pretty much garbage. Well, okay. So Wes you have a laptop. Here's your work laptop

42:33.420 --> 42:36.980
you run mint on it sort of a standard practice cinnamon edition as a matter of fact and

42:36.980 --> 42:39.860
You watch this stuff

42:40.260 --> 42:45.140
Let's talk here's a couple things on the top of my head that mint kind of gets tossed around for for not really

42:45.660 --> 42:47.660
addressing some say they

42:48.060 --> 42:54.060
Inappropriately just pull from the Ubuntu repos and sort of right on top of that their bandwidth their infrastructure, etc

42:54.820 --> 42:58.700
They distribute now, of course, they make isos available that don't have this stuff

42:58.700 --> 43:05.020
But they distribute isos with codecs and flash pre-installed which many distributions see fedora and others

43:05.020 --> 43:08.180
So you can't actually do there seems to be no regard for that

43:08.180 --> 43:11.700
Although an attempt is made to make an ISO available without them, but it exists nonetheless

43:12.700 --> 43:18.460
There's also the the matter of sort of avoiding kernel updates as a matter of actual desktop policy

43:18.780 --> 43:22.580
Then there's the there's the whole create your own X apps, etc, etc

43:23.700 --> 43:27.700
When you look at all of this in whole are we seeing something here that is perhaps

43:30.220 --> 43:32.220
Indicative of

43:32.220 --> 43:34.220
Some

43:34.620 --> 43:40.660
Things that are just not properly being taken care of and when you when you look at it as a as a Linux Mint user

43:40.980 --> 43:42.900
Are you worried?

43:42.900 --> 43:47.500
That their eyes off the ball on a few of these things they could have somebody come after them for legal issues when it comes

43:47.500 --> 43:53.460
To the codecs. They've obviously got infrastructure problems with when it comes to the security. Why why why wasn't why weren't the MD?

43:53.460 --> 43:56.260
Five sums properly signed. Why weren't they properly signed?

43:56.260 --> 44:03.540
It's an easy thing to do that anybody that has a moderately large distribution would probably want to have done. They didn't even bother doing it

44:03.540 --> 44:05.540
Right. Why wasn't why why were these things missed?

44:06.260 --> 44:11.740
Does that bother you? I think it shows a lot of the and I don't I'm not gonna call them growing pains

44:11.740 --> 44:17.200
But just Linux Mint has gained a lot in popularity since its early days like 13 or whatever, right?

44:18.340 --> 44:22.220
And it really is, you know, you can't compared a lot to fedora or a bunch of these are both

44:22.220 --> 44:29.700
Distributions with companies behind them Linux Mint is you know a volunteer team and not only are they focusing on you know

44:30.140 --> 44:31.060
building

44:31.060 --> 44:35.700
Well an operating system but building a whole skin for an operating system as well as these new X apps and all that

44:35.700 --> 44:38.260
But they have to run all the infrastructure and I think it's showing that

44:38.820 --> 44:40.660
You don't you know, it takes a lot to do that

44:40.660 --> 44:43.580
And especially if your passion is I want to make I'm working on you know

44:43.780 --> 44:51.300
Cinnamon a whole DE that they're building here. You probably don't have any cycles left as they're running a first-rate infrastructure. Hmm

44:51.300 --> 44:54.440
but I guess I do it I guess I don't know if I

44:54.980 --> 45:00.120
Yeah, I guess I guess like I mostly I guess I mostly agree. It feels like

45:00.820 --> 45:02.820
It feels like it is a bit of a growing thing

45:04.100 --> 45:07.420
But at the same time it feels like it's also just a lack of priority

45:07.420 --> 45:09.020
I guess before I go too far

45:09.020 --> 45:12.900
I think I think one of the things is maybe not serving Linux Mint at this point is

45:13.820 --> 45:18.180
Clem has traditionally been anti media anti interview closed off

45:18.180 --> 45:22.460
It doesn't doesn't do them as sort of a matter of policy for him personally

45:22.580 --> 45:26.740
Good or bad what that is kind of left is it kind of left a lot of people to fill in the gaps about what?

45:26.740 --> 45:28.540
Clem thinks about things

45:28.540 --> 45:31.740
Until something like this happens and then all as we can do from the outside is go

45:31.740 --> 45:34.860
Well, why didn't he have the why didn't he have the hashes signed?

45:34.860 --> 45:39.420
Why was WordPress not bubble like we can all we can all sit here and play you know

45:39.420 --> 45:41.220
Like hindsight's 2020 kind of thing

45:41.220 --> 45:44.460
But I guess I don't want to bash on him for it

45:44.460 --> 45:48.300
But I I do look at it and I go this may be indicative of larger problems

45:48.300 --> 45:50.820
I think it is indicative of larger problems, and I think

45:52.180 --> 45:55.220
If mitts gonna I guess if mitts gonna keep growing these are problems

45:55.220 --> 46:00.380
They're gonna get you have to really reflect on how you build what you're doing. They're gonna be that scale exactly

46:00.380 --> 46:02.540
That's the problem is well guess what now?

46:02.540 --> 46:08.300
We're here or at the scale and these problems are and it's kind of things like Linux is great for letting you set up right like

46:08.300 --> 46:12.180
He could build this website on a couple of servers that runs and distributes for his distribution

46:12.180 --> 46:17.220
But once you're a popular Linux distribution you get a lot more attention than you do if you're just you know one of the ones

46:17.220 --> 46:19.220
in the weeds and you start needing to like

46:19.340 --> 46:23.580
Sky go after you that only went kits and I want you to jump in and share your thoughts on this so far

46:24.540 --> 46:29.420
Actually, I think that a site like a distro watch could really help with something like this

46:29.420 --> 46:31.780
They could host the checksums

46:31.780 --> 46:37.260
They could even make it a little interface to where he could download the torrents or the ISOs

46:37.580 --> 46:39.580
What happens when they get hacked?

46:39.580 --> 46:46.020
And then everybody's compromised. I would hope that they would have better security. I would hope that about Linux mint

46:48.020 --> 46:50.820
I mean this is this is probably a good question

46:51.580 --> 46:55.620
Because I don't I don't think this is something unique to mint anybody could run into this issue

46:55.620 --> 46:59.940
I would have if I started my own distro, right? I mean it could happen to JB

46:59.940 --> 47:04.220
yeah, and so I feel like maybe that maybe we as a group could come up with a

47:04.220 --> 47:09.220
Better solution something that is maybe I don't know

47:09.480 --> 47:14.620
So I'm gonna start with Micah Lee Micah Lee he he wrote a blog post and a couple of things jumped out at me

47:14.620 --> 47:19.620
He said it's also important to note that comparing the checksums of the file you downloaded with ones you see on a website

47:19.620 --> 47:23.980
You download isn't secure either and this is always like we all check the checks on the trucks on

47:24.580 --> 47:30.180
Even if you using Shaw 256 if a hacker can hack the website to modify the download link

47:30.180 --> 47:34.120
They can modify the checksum at the same time to match the malicious download

47:35.200 --> 47:40.260
The only solution to this problem is to use public key

47:41.120 --> 47:42.440
cryptography and

47:42.440 --> 47:46.860
I that seems to that seems to register with me is this is a wider problem that all distros have

47:47.160 --> 47:50.720
When it comes to actually verifying the ISO that you get go ahead. Hmm

47:51.480 --> 47:53.640
Well, no, not every distro tails

47:53.640 --> 47:59.840
I think is the only one that actually one of the ones I remember that actually provides a PGP key to verify the guy

47:59.840 --> 48:05.080
So far that makes sense. Yeah, you know other than that almost all projects never do most of the time

48:06.240 --> 48:14.040
But don't other distros besides don't other distros besides tails also GPG sign wizard you're mentioning other distros do this as well, right?

48:14.240 --> 48:14.740
Yeah

48:14.740 --> 48:19.340
So the thing is near almost every distro I can think of off top of my head

48:19.400 --> 48:26.240
That most people flock to is one that I you know, everyone uses the GPG key to sign their final ISO release

48:26.240 --> 48:30.460
I mean it's built by the main, you know, the main build server and then it's pushed out

48:30.460 --> 48:33.240
It's tested and then they sign it and say okay

48:33.480 --> 48:39.120
Put it up there with the GPG key so that the mirrors will go and we'll only copy that specific file with

48:39.400 --> 48:42.200
GPG key that we've signed and they know that GPG key, right?

48:42.200 --> 48:48.440
And it would have been a huge thing if the mirrors had come back when this hell happened to mint and said hey

48:49.080 --> 48:53.600
Your GPG key just changed. Is there a reason you know why right?

48:53.600 --> 48:59.280
It would have it would have saved them so much trouble. It would have probably been alerted them immediately

49:00.160 --> 49:06.280
Maybe I mean you're still relying on end-users to check and I think that's sort of the failing bit about it

49:06.280 --> 49:11.600
It needs to be a system that almost checks itself sort of like how a bit torrent right and distributed so that it can check

49:11.680 --> 49:16.900
Multiple and make sure that you know, well if you're the check some for this or the signature for this match as well from this

49:16.900 --> 49:24.820
You have the solution just we need to get the OEMs to install a UE

49:25.180 --> 49:27.260
UEFI key that actually, you know

49:29.180 --> 49:31.180
Yeah, yeah

49:32.260 --> 49:34.260
Secure boot everybody

49:36.180 --> 49:38.180
God oh no

49:38.220 --> 49:43.820
You probably right to which would be which would work as long as Clem didn't you know? Yeah

49:43.820 --> 49:47.380
Yeah, that's true. I feel like that gets good at having that set

49:50.140 --> 49:51.460
I

49:51.460 --> 49:56.820
Think this is a good point for rolling these truths. I mean you're not installing all the time

49:57.180 --> 50:04.940
Seriously, it won't be an issue at least for that long. Yeah, and well people reporting non-user centric bugs

50:05.500 --> 50:09.700
Should be having more attention because usually those are not exposed

50:09.700 --> 50:14.580
exposed it's like well, there is this thing what we're gonna keep it quiet because we want to fix it and

50:15.460 --> 50:20.020
Things are forgotten. I think before we move on one thing. I wanted to just mention is

50:20.780 --> 50:26.020
I was pretty damn surprised at how the Linux community has turned on mint

50:27.100 --> 50:29.100
during this

50:30.060 --> 50:36.820
One of the one of the more popular Linux weekly news threads right now is I don't think Linux mint is a is a

50:36.820 --> 50:40.660
Pot as a professionally built distribution, and there's a whole

50:41.220 --> 50:44.020
deep conversation going on right there and a

50:44.860 --> 50:50.900
Lot of it is a bunch of people who just seemed to be upset from previous encounters and things like that kind of dogpiling

50:50.900 --> 50:53.420
Right now, and it's I think it's a little unfortunate

50:53.420 --> 50:59.620
I I think it's unfortunate that this happened, and I think that bad is on Clem, but I think at the same time

51:00.220 --> 51:03.860
What he needs to do now, and if he did this I think if he just came you know

51:03.860 --> 51:07.420
He's already been pretty transparent and straightforward and so now if just moving forward

51:07.420 --> 51:10.860
He's very honest and transparent about what they're doing to resolve the issue

51:10.860 --> 51:14.740
And how this isn't gonna happen again, and why they know it's not gonna happen again talk about your new infrastructure

51:14.740 --> 51:17.380
Talk about what you're changing. That's all it takes right. Yeah

51:17.380 --> 51:20.960
That's what it takes people will read it and be interested and you'll get you know you lose users

51:20.960 --> 51:25.880
Yeah, but you'll get new users. You see yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree okay wizard you get the the final word here

51:26.740 --> 51:30.020
No, I was just gonna say the main people that are pushing this

51:30.020 --> 51:36.460
are a couple people that have a little bit of sour grapes because they've dealt with these projects before and

51:37.180 --> 51:39.180
they have had disagreements and

51:39.540 --> 51:46.460
Some of those people tend to think that if you don't follow their agreement, then you're you know you can't possibly be right

51:47.540 --> 51:54.540
So there's just no everyone's jumping on everyone right now because everyone's going and saying ha ha I told you and

51:54.540 --> 52:00.060
You know so a little for a little while. I think you're gonna see people jumping all over the place

52:00.380 --> 52:06.140
Yeah, I think you're probably right, and you know that is sort of the price you pay when something like this happens, right?

52:06.660 --> 52:13.380
That is sort of unfortunately the thing and that is why I broke my wordpress installation Sunday night upgrading wordpress

52:13.620 --> 52:16.300
Because I didn't want to be the guy that was talking about this with a night

52:16.380 --> 52:20.200
Please don't go pick on me because really I don't have enough time to work on this and you know

52:20.200 --> 52:26.480
We need some white hack JB stuff here make sure I wonder if this is across Clem's mind because I've definitely talked about this on

52:26.480 --> 52:30.480
Air there's several times. I thought I just need to drop wordpress. I don't have time

52:30.480 --> 52:33.720
I mean, I think wordpress is a great super awesome project

52:34.400 --> 52:36.000
And I don't have any problems with it

52:36.000 --> 52:41.080
But I also like I'm not here to manage a website right and I I just I don't nobody is

52:41.440 --> 52:45.040
nobody is here to manage a website everybody else has got something else to do and

52:45.040 --> 52:50.520
The problem is that that means it just sort of sits and it's one of those things that really does need to be managed

52:50.600 --> 52:53.800
Yeah, I was see I was thinking about going to ghost exactly see either remembers

52:53.800 --> 52:57.400
I was but then the thing the issue was is they I started looking at all the features

52:57.400 --> 53:02.020
We'd have to rebuild and I thought oh gosh well and the ghost download was just down for a little while they moved to Singapore

53:03.680 --> 53:05.680
Okay, all right

53:05.840 --> 53:08.440
All right, so Swift wraps it up with he says well Swift

53:08.440 --> 53:11.560
Do you want to you could you want to just sort of say what you just said in the chat room sort of as our?

53:11.560 --> 53:13.360
final thought on the topic

53:13.360 --> 53:20.200
Yeah, I want to make it clear. I honestly trust Clem Linux mint has not lost my support at all

53:20.200 --> 53:25.600
I'm sorry this happened, but it ultimately will be good for the latest community as a whole. I hope so

53:25.600 --> 53:27.120
I hope that is a very good way to put it

53:27.120 --> 53:29.960
That's a good final thought on the topic if you have any thoughts out there in the audience

55:55.080 --> 55:57.080
But wait an all-episode for this

55:57.560 --> 56:01.000
So I as you may have been aware

56:01.640 --> 56:03.480
West

56:03.480 --> 56:05.220
last week

56:05.220 --> 56:06.280
after

56:06.280 --> 56:11.560
445 days of waiting I had a chance to try out the purism Libra ultimate Linux laptop

56:12.000 --> 56:14.960
And I don't know if you know what to get the timing right on this

56:14.960 --> 56:18.480
So we're gonna go to the horse's mouth directly here for just for a moment

56:18.480 --> 56:23.240
But my recollection goes down like this in the time since I backed the purism a

56:23.640 --> 56:29.760
Company I'd never heard of called intro where has come around and it started shipping laptops preloaded by the way with Ubuntu Mate and

56:30.400 --> 56:32.520
They have a couple of different products out there

56:32.520 --> 56:38.920
We'll talk more about that in a sec, but the one that I want to talk about today is intro where's Apollo laptop

56:39.520 --> 56:46.360
It's it's I think it starts a base price around 700 US greenbacks somewhere around there depending on the conversion rate

56:46.360 --> 56:48.640
it is a 13-inch laptop and

56:49.520 --> 56:53.760
I have it here in my hands and they sent me a version of the Apollo

56:53.800 --> 57:00.560
pretty well spec'd to see how it stacks up to the Libra 15 and others in terms of build quality performance and

57:00.760 --> 57:04.580
All of that so I have it here. They have had it for about 24 hours

57:05.640 --> 57:11.900
And before we go any further I want to introduce Mike from intro where Mike welcome to Linux unplugged and tell the folks listening

57:11.920 --> 57:14.680
What you do over there at intro where what is that title of yours?

57:14.680 --> 57:15.880
I

57:15.880 --> 57:22.960
Hi, I'm the co-founder of intro and we build Linux computers for the UK at the moment and soon

57:23.320 --> 57:25.320
some of Europe and

57:26.040 --> 57:28.480
The Apollo arrived on my doorstep

57:29.440 --> 57:30.880
yesterday and

57:30.880 --> 57:32.880
It is a 13-inch laptop

57:33.680 --> 57:38.920
very similar in in sort of look to say a MacBook Air or

57:38.920 --> 57:47.560
Or really the Apollo 15 only I'm sorry the Libra 15 only 13 inches very very very good build quality

57:47.560 --> 57:53.520
And so Mike I'm just curious. I I don't actually think are you selling these in the US at the moment?

57:54.680 --> 57:56.800
No, we're not selling in the US for a while

57:57.440 --> 58:01.960
The reason why yours got a US keyboard layout is because we're going to be shipping them to some

58:02.360 --> 58:06.940
EU countries because they also use that layout. Oh my gosh. I got you

58:06.940 --> 58:12.300
So a little bit about the Apollo if you would give can you give me some background on how this computer came to be?

58:12.620 --> 58:13.620
and

58:13.620 --> 58:15.940
Any kind of interesting details about the Apollo?

58:17.100 --> 58:22.380
Yeah, we started selling when his computer is about a year and a half ago, maybe two

58:23.900 --> 58:28.940
We got a lot of requests for an ultrabook and we just found

58:30.340 --> 58:34.020
An ODM in China where we could have them built and shipped over

58:34.020 --> 58:37.300
It is it you make it sound so simple

58:37.300 --> 58:41.580
But what I find to be remarkable about it, and this is something that every single person that I have

58:42.300 --> 58:44.300
Put this in their hands and said

58:44.740 --> 58:49.140
Is it feels really really sturdy really well built and?

58:49.700 --> 58:54.300
And they also people often tell me it feels a little heavy which I think adds to that it feels well built right

58:54.860 --> 58:56.860
And so I'm curious to how

58:57.540 --> 59:01.740
It was a matter of finding the right builder was it what what is it that?

59:01.740 --> 59:07.500
Entraware has been able to accomplish here when it comes to build quality that other vendors sort of in the space. Maybe haven't gotten to

59:17.500 --> 59:23.300
Is it just happened to be the partner builds a good machine because I mean it seems feel wise it's it's pretty significantly well built

59:24.100 --> 59:30.180
Yeah, so we approached a few people and these are one of the few that did solid build

59:30.180 --> 59:32.900
So one of the few that did solid aluminium chassis

59:33.720 --> 59:39.100
So we chose them obviously because they had to build quality and then the keyboard also

59:39.100 --> 59:44.340
I don't know what the process was of selecting the keyboard, but versus some of the others the keyboard is pretty nice, too

59:44.980 --> 59:49.860
And feels good in the hand the keys are actually translucent so the backlighting shines through

59:50.260 --> 59:52.260
Which is nice and the fan?

59:52.260 --> 59:59.820
Isn't running crazy loud the fan actually seems to properly cool the machine which was a nice surprise

59:59.820 --> 01:00:01.540
When I took it out of the box

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:07.020
Was there any particular tricks you guys had to pull to make this thing work properly with Linux or was it all pretty easy?

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:11.820
Well the first the first revision we had there was a few problems with the farm

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:16.980
We had the mind out in the firmware, so that's no go yeah

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:21.860
I would I would agree so if there was definitely some problems with the fan if you ran into the same problems

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:26.940
I did so if I wipe the if I wipe the OS that this came loaded with will the fan still work fine

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:32.780
Or will it stop working normally no exactly the same as what it's doing now, so it's firmware level then it's totally hard

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:38.740
Well, that's awesome. So I got it so my first impressions of this are this is one of the most well-built laptops

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:43.860
I've ever held would you agree? Oh, yeah, I really want one now. Yeah, so it's got one

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:51.140
two USB 3.0 ports plus USB C. It's got an SD card slot reader full-size HDMI out and

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:54.820
Headphone jack and entry where was kind enough to include a USB

01:00:55.420 --> 01:01:03.500
Ethernet box because there's no USB Ethernet on this it's got a 13 inch screen 1080p resolution on it two hard drives a

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:08.940
500 gigabyte spinning for the home and a 120 gigabyte SSD for the root

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:12.160
Yeah, two hard drives in a in a 13 inch laptop, too

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.920
Mike that's a pretty impressive spec a skylake Intel processor

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:21.920
And it's silent. I haven't heard it sound since I've been here. Yeah

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.160
That's a pretty impressive piece of hardware is the are the Apollo cells

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.400
Meeting your expectations

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:34.680
Yeah, they keep growing as we get more publicity on them because they are really good for the price

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.080
Yeah, I use a base $700 now the base $700

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.600
Yeah, I think has like an i3 and 4 gigs of RAM, but you just bring it up from there

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:49.400
And and then and then Mike could you talk a little bit about the choice to work with Ubuntu Mate?

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.400
What drove that and how's that going?

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:59.560
Well as approached by Martin about a year ago, and we just had a back-and-to when I was a big fan of the project

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.560
So it was obviously a good

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:06.000
Move to start shipping of our machines. Yeah, it feels fast

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.640
You know it's my first experience with it when you get a machine

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.520
You know with a nice fast skylake processor and plenty of RAM

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.520
And then you throw the Mate desktop on there with with the Ubuntu base

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.120
It feels really snappy so ready to go yeah, and the battery life

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.480
I don't have numbers yet, but the battery life has been pretty good

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:26.000
I think part of that is because the desktop environment just isn't really very demanding

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.360
So you feel like you get a nice performing computer with a very reasonable

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:33.400
Modern desktop plus you get someone like intro right here

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:37.000
We're like they're a company right so like if you have problems longer term

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.440
You know they're they're gonna be around to support them and to fix them

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.000
so the number one question Mike that everybody in the chat room wants and has is

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:50.440
How how how likely and possible is it for intro where to eventually start selling in the US is that a possibility for you guys?

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.440
Or is that just a lot of trouble?

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.240
There is a possibility, but we'll wait for we're gonna wait for a few more

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.240
A larger amount of orders before we start shipping over there. We're gonna

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:07.000
Make sure all of the you saw it first. Yeah, yeah, you get it nailed there that makes a lot to work on the JB group

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.200
Order yeah

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.040
There you go. Yeah group order this thing is

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.840
Boy, I can't wait to just keep trying it over the week

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:19.880
This is this is gonna be my main machine for the week seems like a great little just getting stuff done laptop

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:23.080
Yeah, I am really looking forward to putting it through its paces so far

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:30.920
It sounds like like it's silent and silent is a big deal for me, so I'm really happy about that and I a one thing

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:36.320
I may be continuing to troubleshoot, and I haven't I don't know if it's just the Wi-Fi here or what

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.320
But I've had a couple of Wi-Fi issues

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:43.640
Where the either the transfer rate has been real bad like I'm talking like I'm getting 2,000 millisecond pings

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:49.560
Or it just won't find the network, but I in both cases it actually could be interference

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:54.200
So I'm gonna take it out to a known good location where I only have one Wi-Fi access

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.200
point there's no other Wi-Fi accesses points around or access eyes and

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.880
See if I have any issues, but so far

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.480
I other than that and then with the ether adapter of course

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:09.800
I've had zero problems and Ubuntu Mate has been has been pretty great, too. I really like the design

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.180
It because it's a little bit smaller than the Librem it feels a little tighter

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:19.000
There's a notch where you put your finger that kind of is reminiscent of the way the Mac books do it

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.160
Yeah, which looks nice it really all it all comes together

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:29.560
It's it's it's got a bottom plate that could be removed with one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:33.920
Screws so you remove twelve little Phillips screws, and it looks like the bottom plate would come off

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.680
But it seems like such a good laptop like you show but a conference

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:43.380
And it's it's just a little different, and you've got it running Linux, and it works well. Yeah. Yeah, I really like it

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.200
I'm really really happy that the keys are

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.080
actually

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.960
The the letters are translucent so the backlit key light actually shines through the keys

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.780
Which is nice because otherwise it's kind of pointless to have the backlighting Mike is there anything else you want to add about the Apollo

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.920
Before we move on I know that's it very good sir and wimpy was there anything you wanted to add

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:10.840
Any thoughts I'd like to add yeah, yeah Mike's being far too modest

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.720
Mike has

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.360
Intro ship with a company that you'd be very interested in hearing about I think

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.240
Tell me more

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
So now partners

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.760
Val okay Mike now are you bearing the lead here hold on we have ourselves a little valve story

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.760
I got to hear it tell me about it

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:37.240
Yeah, so we're official valve partners, so we're gonna be building a steam machine shipping them out a few months

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.880
very cool I

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.880
Have you I've already begun testing come on now. Are you a gamer Mike?

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.320
We had one prototype

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.600
I'll count this year for people to use and

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:59.560
Got a good reaction so my you know Mike. I gotta say. I don't know a lot about entry where my

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:04.560
My initial impressions are is you guys are very clever?

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:09.820
So it just it just it struck me just in the name of this device

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.280
It's a pretty great device, and you went with the name Apollo

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:20.560
Which when I say Apollo West what's the next thing you think of fast? Oh you do well?

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:25.240
I don't know I think 13. I think Apollo 13. Oh 13 right and what is this?

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:31.080
13 inch yeah, it's a 13 inch laptop. It is it's brilliant. I mean it shows you a little bit of the

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.200
I I to me

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:38.120
I think it just it sort of demonstrates a little bit of the thought that goes into it is it's an Apollo

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.560
13 but of course the product name is just Apollo because

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:44.600
The 13 just sort of comes naturally part of it

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:48.320
And it makes you think what laptop to Chris get got that Apollo and how big was oh yeah?

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:52.260
I was 13 inches Apollo 13. That's clear and the 15 should be called Creed

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:53.960
No

01:06:53.960 --> 01:07:01.760
No, nothing ever gets called Creed. That's that's that has been banned, but yeah, so I I think it's pretty good kids

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.480
And you you had something you wanted to add to go ahead sir

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.660
When you said Apollo, I actually thought art and illumination like the

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:16.740
Roman slash Greek God yeah, yeah, okay, all right, okay fine not everybody thinks

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.080
But it does have proper backlit key so

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:26.200
It elimination is accurate all right, okay fine fine all those are good. See it's a clever name

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.200
Nothing nonetheless. It is a clever name

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.840
So I have if you're listening to the audio version

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:34.800
And you're curious what the hell does this thing look like and probably a lot of you are listening to the audio version in the show

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.800
notes I have a link to an album I took up up on campsite and

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:43.240
I posted pictures of because I was like hey, you know what you know what makes a good background for photos

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.920
The freaking Pacific Northwest yes, it does. It's a pretty good-looking state so Washington is so I put that up there

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:53.800
And yes, it does have a an Ubuntu button actually it's a matte button

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:57.880
So that's pretty yeah, I like seeing you can customize that right on the website. That's great. Yeah

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.760
Yeah, and it's a it's a sticker, but it's a translucent sticker

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:06.240
So it doesn't block the light which which makes that attention to detail

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:16.760
So I'm right now. I'm running Ubuntu Mate 1510 or mate or whatever addition on there. I may stick with that I

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:21.680
I I I don't I don't know what exactly it is

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:28.040
But this particular hardware has made me also want to just see what it'd be like to have elementary OS on it

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:35.160
Just to kind of go all the way. I don't know though because the thing is is right now for testing Ubuntu mate makes such a great

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.920
Low-key desktop environment that it's like you just get all of the machines performance out of it

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.160
So I just don't know about it Wimpy you had one more comment go ahead

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:50.360
Um, yeah, the version of Ubuntu mate that you're running there is actually sort of Ubuntu mate 1512

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.040
Really?

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.080
Yeah, yeah

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:59.720
So what you've got there is Ubuntu mate 1510 and then I worked with Mike to get the mate

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.060
1.12 desktop on there rather than mate 1.10

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:09.560
Did that is because in mate 1.12 we introduced

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:12.720
in the control panels

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.880
two

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:18.560
Finger three finger touch configuration. Yes, and I do really appreciate that

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.200
Yeah, so that's why we've just given you a slightly custom version

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:29.300
But so if I reloaded the OS it might I might not get the the the trackpad configuration stuff

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:34.640
No, the the trackpad works on all OSs sure, but Barte didn't have

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:39.840
The UI touch options until just recently that is it actually

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:44.800
exceptionally nice because so it is a good sized trackpad and when you go into the

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:52.000
Mouse settings in in mate you can you can say two fingers down as a right-click or in the corner is a right-click

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.360
I want to scroll by touching the right side of the trackpad

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:58.200
I want to scroll by using two fingers like all of that is available for you. Wow. Yeah

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.920
Really nice. So that's good to know. Yeah, I think I might stick with it

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.760
I I just I really have very little reason to replace it once I have it all set up

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.120
It really works super good. The only thing I might want to play fine. Yeah, sorry

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:16.260
I was gonna say you'll be fine when you go with an turgos as well cuz I know Mike runs arch. Oh, really?

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:19.560
Okay, cool there and you know

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:23.840
I was also thinking 16 if I all the other thing I might do is might do the 1604 version of Ubuntu Mate

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:29.600
Yeah, yeah and just do that because that and that would likely still have the configuration options right for my trackpad

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:34.720
Yeah, that's all built into 1604. Boom. Boom. I loves it. I

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.100
Have not done the distro bands bounce the chat room was asking. So yeah, but I might buy by the time

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:41.600
I buy the time last comes around

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.200
I think if all goes as planned this will be my review for last and we'll compare it to the to the two

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.720
I might try to do some performance stuff

01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.360
So if anybody has any questions or or even better yet

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:58.400
suggestions of ways to benchmark a system like this that actually produce information that we care about and

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:04.680
That is relevant. I would love to know that Linux actual at reddit comm you could link the benchmarks there

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.680
or something like that

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.120
Oh

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:13.920
Okay, so Wimpy I will absolutely have to have Loki if I want to try it on this machine. Why is that? Yeah for elementary

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.800
elementary is based on

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.400
1404 right which doesn't have Skylake support

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.040
Right, right and Loki's based on 1604

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.920
Yeah

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:29.200
Okay. All right. Well see 15 10 or better see somebody's got to make me a Loki

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:34.600
I said just cuz it looks like it looks like if you here's my thinking right you put that on here

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:39.000
And then you go to like a mall or somewhere you say you say look at the new Macbook. What do you think?

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:46.720
Shriner prankster and you know before before we before we walk away and say oh, it's a big Macbook ripoff

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:50.600
I want to actually make sure I'm clear I did when I look at it

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.600
I actually don't give the impression that it's trying to rip off from the Macbook what I get the impression of is

01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:01.760
Aluminum makes pretty good material for this and when you make a 13-inch machine, there's only so much room

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:07.000
I actually in some ways that I would say there's potential the keyboard may be better than the Macbook keyboard

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.440
I'm gonna type some more and tell you the truth if that's I don't know about the trackpad

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:16.480
But the keyboard I think might be better and this this thing with with one two three USB ports

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.840
I think outclasses the Macbook in terms of connectivity plus a

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:27.620
Dedicated HDMI out port and an SD card slot reader this thing might outclass the Macbook and connectivity

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:29.400
But I'm not I'm not sure about that

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:34.280
And so I don't actually I think it's I think it's selling it short to say always copying the Macbook

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:39.320
I think what it is. It's taking design cues from a good design, but it also I think is

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:44.480
Its own product very much its own product and I'm I like it a lot

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:49.560
But that is my that's my first impression if you wanted to take check out some pictures go over to the show notes

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:54.680
And if you got ideas on things you want me to do to test it, let me know so skylake. It's got Intel graphics

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.280
So we'll see what happens. We got two. We got two drives in there

01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.080
I

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.520
Mean a Linux action show dot reddit calm

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.800
That's also where you can go to submit content for this show or any other show we do

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:09.240
We appreciate that helps sort of form what we end up talking about West

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:13.960
Is there anything else we want to cover in today's episode of the unplug program? I don't think so

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:19.540
It's been a big show today. Oh my gosh, Wes, and I got to be the fool that edits. It's all together. Oh, man

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:25.760
It's for people who like to mess with computers. I am NOT looking forward to that West that is that is you know

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:28.240
Maybe it just comes out later this week once Rekha

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:34.520
Just put it out a few days Rekha. I left all the editing for you. Yeah, that's true. Hey, mr.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:41.320
Producer q5 sis got his acceptance letter for Linux fest Northwest talk. That's awesome. That is super awesome. Of course, we're grads

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:45.440
We're gonna we're gonna get Wes at Linux fest Northwest. Oh, we're gonna have people up

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:50.920
Do you guys got to be there to Linux fest Northwest org be so cool to have people from the mumble room make it to?

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:54.560
That'd be super nice. All right, check us out on Tuesdays

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:59.280
We do the show live Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar JB live TV to watch that Linux action show at reddit comm to send us

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:28.880
Feedback Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact to send us in some emails. See you back here next Tuesday

01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:40.480
Thank you for making it in I hope the project makes it are you guys gonna push forward if it doesn't quite clear

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.720
What's your what do you have? Are you formulating a plan B? Yeah, we may try and do something

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:50.160
Um, if it doesn't quite go through we'll see what happens. Yeah, I think that's a great idea regardless

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.360
But hopefully it makes you something animation. So cute. Yeah, like I love that. Yeah, great

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:54.600
Yeah

01:14:54.600 --> 01:15:00.960
Sometimes the those crowdfunding projects break through towards the end as people get motivated so you never know. Yeah. All right

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:03.480
Cool, man. Thank you for being here

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:08.760
Thanks from both to me JB titles comm chat room. Everybody go boat or bang suggest comm

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.880
Let's pick our title it out and then we're gonna get the heck out of here

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:19.000
So I'm like, okay, even though this is the dumbest idea. I I should probably upgrade WordPress before I release last I

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:23.920
Mean cuz that's one more thing to do man. Well, and it's like well it takes a while to encode

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:28.840
So I've got like an hour here to play with and I'm like I could spend this hour upgrading my WordPress installation

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.040
And then I'm not I don't look like the world's biggest

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.800
Hypocrite right and even though in the show I'm like I I suffer from this problem, too

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.600
I just thought this would be a good idea a little follow-through. Yeah

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:42.680
And so I don't want JB to get hacked pretty solid idea a couple of things that really bit me in the ass

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.320
They come the compounded

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:47.000
So first of all, I had to struggle through getting final cut to work

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.600
Which was just a disaster required a ton of maintenance to get final cut to perform properly. I I got through that in coding

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.240
That's pretty solid. Not a big deal the WebM encoding a two hour and ten minute episode

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.080
WebM was literally going in real time

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:05.400
and so it basically took two hours and ten minutes to encode one WebM file which looks way worse than any of the

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.880
x264 files and is way larger and

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:13.360
On top of all that like getting through all the final cut problems. I decide okay. I'm gonna do this WordPress upgrade. I

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Do the upgrade?

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.120
It goes pretty solid

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.680
except

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.160
One of the most critical plugins we have breaks. Oh

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:30.840
convert markdown to HTML and as you know Wes all of our show notes are written in markdown for all of our shows and

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.540
This ability to post the shows in markdown just broke on the JB site and I'm like, okay

01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:39.600
I didn't I didn't need this. Nope. I don't I don't want this right now

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.960
And so I start looking into well, I'll just go get a new WordPress plugin

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:49.860
So I do the thing that everybody does I install like three different freaking plugins and the third plug-in. I try to activate

01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:51.420
something

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:53.860
Happens and it just starts slamming the mysql database

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:59.180
Well that takes down the whole back end of the WordPress site. And so I'm like in the chair. I'm like Alan

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:04.180
Are you around Alan? No Alan. It's a Sunday afternoon. He's in Canada. I don't even know what he's doing

01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:07.900
He's doing so in Canadian and he's totally a he's totally afk

01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:13.260
The back end of the JB website is down. The files are finishing encoding as the site goes down

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:15.020
I'm like what is going on?

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:18.700
Of course the YouTube encoding is is chewing away now and I'm like come on

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:22.500
I can't get this side up. Eventually the mysql server starts responding again. I

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:27.740
Don't know why maybe just some sort of BSD magic. It finished deleting all of your data

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:33.660
Yeah, and so I log back in still no markdown plugins turns out in the new in the new WordPress

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:40.500
They want you to use jetpack and jetpack has a markdown kind of feature that you can use

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:44.580
Okay. Well so to use jetpack you have to activate jetpack

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:48.500
That's really so I installed the jetpack plug-in and I go to activate jetpack

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:52.580
Authentication failure

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:54.660
What I tried again

01:17:56.100 --> 01:18:00.460
Authentication failure unable to activate what is going on? I started looking into it

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:04.380
They're like, yeah, if your mysql server is running real bad and having some performance issues

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:09.380
It causes enough of a delay that the sync doesn't work and you can't activate the plug-in

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:12.260
So because whatever's going on with the mysql server

01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:17.260
I can't activate this plug-in which gives me markdown support so I can't post the show because now I need markdown support to support

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.820
So a long story short

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:24.620
I've now been manually converting markdown to HTML and just posting them shows is it which is not a big deal

01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:27.460
But it it's it means that we have your workflow and we have this

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:33.520
Mismatch of stump some stuff in markdown and some stuff in HTML and it's just you don't go have a canonical copy

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:35.740
Yeah, so now he's gonna now he's gonna have to go fix that

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:40.620
I love you. Okay
