1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,420
Hey look there's a picture of Popey. Oh, oh, he looks so happy surprise. I bet he smells good there, too

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,400
What the hell are you using the laptop is that your phone Popey that you have hooked up to a keyboard ten times the size

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,980
Of your phone. What is that? That was that was for him because he wanted a photo of a phone doing convergency stuff

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,940
Oh

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:35,220
I see I see I like the image text where the desktop was the phone is now says I love stroking the rich mahogany

6
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,420
He blew his ex we ask you. Yeah, really

7
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,900
What kind of that is a heck of a keyboard is there a lot of battery in that thing what's going on with that

8
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,220
Why is it so big?

9
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:55,700
The Logitech one. It's so you could you could sit a tablet in it and but it's only got a double-a and it lasts forever

10
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,860
Like you lost a year. Well, you got one. It's brilliant. Oh, I love I have a oh, so it's not that thick

11
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,140
So I have a Logitech this because that looks really thick in the picture and the Logitech I have is quite thick

12
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,700
Oh, it's quite scary

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,740
It's it's quite I think about a centimeter and a half thick Chris, which is about no furlongs or something

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,660
Oh, yeah, some students and it's gonna work. It's got something like that

15
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,660
Well, there you go. Either way you can tell that's a man who smells good. That's all I know

16
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,960
Look at that USB cable to there. Look at that. That's a nice flat USB cable. I like that poppy

17
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,620
Is that an internet phone there on the table to get an iPhone 4 or something there? What is that?

18
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,580
There's no iPhones there. That's a BQ phone. Oh

19
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,700
Okay. Okay. Well, they all kind of look alike these days. There's a bunch of phones. Yeah

20
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,940
Yeah, I moved all of the none of them two phones out of the way, yeah, right

21
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:55,100
Smart man, this is Linux unplugged episode 139 for April 5th 2016

22
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,100
Oh

23
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:14,180
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's celebrating Wes's upcoming birthday with a little birthday beer that he brought himself

24
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,380
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Happy early birthday. Well, thank you

25
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,820
Thanks for bringing your birthday beer

26
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,780
Every time well coming up on today's episode of the unplugged program

27
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,780
We're gonna do some updates on our favorite open source projects like we always do and here are some of those

28
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,580
Directly from the horse's mouth then in the in the second half of the show if you will

29
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,940
We're gonna try out a brand new distribution that promises to be beautiful elegant up-to-date fast

30
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,180
Ultra customized and arch-based and it's not a district. You've probably heard of before

31
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,940
Yes, kids. We're gonna look at this guy and tell you if it truly is something you want to take out on a rig like

32
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,820
Yours, maybe Wes has sacrificed his own rig for you to find out standby. We'll tell you about that in a little bit after that. I

33
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,140
Gotta admit it. I've been bit a little bit by the hype bug. I

34
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,340
Want to play with virtual reality Wes, but in Linux land, there's not much going on

35
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,380
Or is there is there a virtual reality desktop environment?

36
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,700
Are there projects available for Linux users right now if you have virtual reality hardware?

37
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,540
We're gonna take a look at the state of virtual reality under Linux and some of the things you could play on

38
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:26,500
Right now and some of the interesting things that Wes and I discovered we were digging around about the state of VR under Linux, too

39
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,220
Which is just kind of an interesting tidbits that we're gonna share plus

40
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,620
We got a whole bunch of other things in today's show, but to top it all off

41
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,180
I did mention we were drinking birthday beers Wes brought in something fun

42
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,620
And I think the moment was gonna give us a hard time about this one

43
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,980
So maybe we'll bring them in first before we really read this one time appropriate greetings mumble room

44
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,660
Okay, now you gotta forgive me

45
00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:00,340
Okay, so you gotta forgive me cuz I I'm just I'm just gonna read it the way I see it crikey IPA an American Indian pale ale

46
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,420
crikey

47
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:09,460
IPA there you go. It's got an 89 beer score 90 from the community. It's an American IPA with a 6.8 alcohol by volume

48
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
from Ruben's brews

49
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,660
in

50
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:20,980
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do. Can you guess where West? Do you know where it's brewed? Yes, I do. Go ahead Seattle, Washington. That's right

51
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,140
It's a local brew ladies and gentlemen, so that's what we're drinking on today's episode that are was sexy. Yeah

52
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,660
Yeah, you're right. That is it reminds me of rain here a little bit. That's what they're going for there

53
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,860
So we have much to talk about today

54
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,900
And there's a topic that we haven't floated before or we actually talk about this on the show

55
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,400
This never come up on the show or is it only something we've talked about behind the scenes. I'm not sure

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,680
I don't know because it's a big deal. It's very scary

57
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,580
developers I've warned us over and over again about uncorrectable issues and

58
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,780
Freedom problems. Yes

59
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,240
Freedom no, no, I'm talking freedom problems negative in the freedom

60
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:06,780
Dimension x86 is just getting a bad rap these days and another developer a long developer involved in core boot

61
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:13,220
Libre boot is trying to call attention to the uncorrectable freedom and security issues on the x86 platform in a newly

62
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,540
freshened

63
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,540
post and a newly freshener

64
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:25,780
attempt to get everybody to realize that post 2009 Intel systems and post 2013 AMD systems have massive flaws this is

65
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:34,560
Mainly he argues in the fact that you have these management platforms the Intel management engine and the AMD security processor

66
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,420
which require these binary only blobs that have major vulnerabilities in them and

67
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,580
He also has issues with you if you EFI secure boot and he wants the community

68
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,760
He is calling upon the community to make a move to arm power MIPS or even risk v processors

69
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,260
He does then provide a summary that is not very exciting about making them. Yeah

70
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,480
But it is a good summary of the estate of the available now, this is a topic

71
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,300
I think that is particularly tickled your interest for a little while. What is it about the whole concept?

72
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,260
Because you've you've been tracking the story since a couple of other reports recently that have said, you know

73
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,240
We have to abandon x86 immediately

74
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,540
We must move to another platform if security is and it is at all important to you

75
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,380
What is it about this x86 story that keeps grabbing your attention? I just think it's not brought up that much

76
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,780
I mean it comes up occasionally

77
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,440
That's why it piques my interest when it does and you just don't hear very much about it

78
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,880
Some of these features are really useful a lot of you know, especially enterprise management

79
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,440
But in particular like I haven't heard very much about the AMD, you know

80
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,960
The piper true true that's not very much and obviously we're not gonna all drop x86

81
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,880
but as we see arm coming up, which again has some problems in some implementations, but I

82
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,720
Don't know

83
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,640
So daredevil in in the mumble room. I know you have some thoughts on this one share it with us, sir

84
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,440
So I'd start with first of all, it's interesting that now there is a competitor

85
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,480
There is trying to get into that realm that there is more research about the actual security of this

86
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,720
Who should be financing this sick of this research?

87
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,640
I mean not saying that the research is biased

88
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,100
I'm saying that there is financing towards researching the issue

89
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,760
Nothing says that there isn't the similar issues on the other platforms or their architectures

90
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,160
So we need you know, it took us years until we realize those things

91
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,960
and having that said

92
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:26,160
The secure boot scenario is all about you start by opting for devices that actually allow you to control the keys

93
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,860
You have in the device moving towards, you know the ability to then replace the thing when we have a free software implementation of it

94
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,480
Since there's interest in the public

95
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,600
Developments are up

96
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,120
Someone something about the idea seems

97
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,400
Fantastical to me like that. We would all make a huge migration like like a migration West like we all get in our

98
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
our low-powered

99
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,240
under-resourced arm

100
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,160
Machines and we just all double down on arm or something like that

101
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,080
I'm not saying it'd be armed

102
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:03,380
But the idea of one day all of us just sort of mass migrating away from x86 is right now seems ludicrous

103
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,840
But it could start to happen

104
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,720
I think it will start to happen at least for once and maybe it is already there arm beats out the chips from

105
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,880
2009 and 2013 if you are concerned about security, right?

106
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,080
There's people who buy the older laptop so you can still get core boot on them. Oh boy

107
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,480
That's not a good solution at all at some point that will cross with where arm is going in terms of capabilities, huh?

108
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,360
Huh? So that's that's a start, but obviously that won't be the mass market

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,360
But to be fair your primary computing device almost certainly is an arm device right now my phone

110
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,400
Yeah, I don't know if I classify it yet as my primary, but it's definitely

111
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
Damn close you

112
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,000
I think you as in the average person who is considering this a ludicrous proposal might

113
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,520
Actually then pull out. You know, they're they're probably even reading the article or arm device

114
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:02,640
You know, you're probably right. I have been I have been shocked at how many people I now know that their primary computing device is

115
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,880
Is is a is a phone I was I already showed that I already shared the story on Kota radio

116
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,880
So I'll just make it super brief, but the community I live in a lot of people there

117
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,960
Are just using their phones as their primary computer and we have like community events

118
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,440
You know, we're all like we had we had a Thanksgiving event. We had an Easter event and a Christmas of any is adorable and

119
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
It when we get together

120
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
It is interesting how

121
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,880
Technically they are a very aware that they could like it's not like they don't have a computer because they are scared of them

122
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,360
They have them at work

123
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,960
But in their estimation they can do everything they need on their phone

124
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,120
Including like they were doing the healthcare gov stuff like they're getting health care exchange coverage on their phone

125
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,320
And and then when they need a computer they just do it at work

126
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,560
And so I think you're right poppy

127
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,320
I think for a lot of people and that's kind of where I was going where I could see this is

128
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:01,080
What if a vendor like Dell or or Apple came out with a really successful arm based laptop?

129
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,440
I'd also peel off a whole bunch of people. I don't know about for me though

130
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,680
Let's stay focused on the issue though. The issue is non free firm or non free code

131
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,560
You're right running at a higher privilege level and almost every arm device has that a proprietary blob that runs in the trust zone

132
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah, you have to run their trust zone. Yeah, there's no way for you to know it's actually inside that yeah

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,640
It's really no better than Intel's management engine. Yeah, that's your primary issue. You're right

134
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,040
Go ahead with me and that trust zone has been riddled with security

135
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
issues for a long long time

136
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Well

137
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,280
You know what actually you know what I've heard people talking about

138
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,640
Oh

139
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,440
Not not risk

140
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,880
But what is it? What was the what is the CPU design that was originally from such spark, right?

141
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:59,400
Is this spark open source aren't spark chips like isn't like the entire spark design or completely open source?

142
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,080
But ship is open source

143
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,120
I think Fujitsu still produces some but all the new ones made by Oracle are completely locked up

144
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,680
They don't release any of the specs for those. I think the old ones all the very lock is out there, isn't it?

145
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,640
Okay, okay North Ranger. There is oh good. There is at least IBM's power

146
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,720
So if you look at like the tell us your workstation

147
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,880
Yeah, at least all of the code that's running on that is open. Even if the chip design is not sure, right sure

148
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,720
North Ranger, did you get a chance to jump in with what you wanted to mention?

149
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:33,240
Yeah, I think you know, it's it's already been alluded to a little bit, but you know, even if you swap out the platform

150
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,640
You know with the CPU that can be booted in an open manner

151
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,360
We're still going to be stuck with peripheral peripherals that have

152
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,280
Binary blobs, even if they're not binary blobs that have to loaded by the OS, you know

153
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,040
Your hard drive has basically an OS running on it to manage all the flash

154
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,280
but none of that though as is as critical as your CPU like if the CPU is the core source of either

155
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,460
If we're just care if we're just if we're just concerned about blobs or really security issues

156
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:07,040
Then that's a fundamental problem. If a peripheral is that's not as egregious

157
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,360
It's still egregious well in the case of a hard drive. It could be pretty egregious

158
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,200
Yeah, I could control what data you're accessing and so it could put in whatever data it wants

159
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Okay, well seen examples of that. Oh

160
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,960
Wimpy's got something for the show notes. I will add to yes open spark. Right? Exactly. Very good. Hmm

161
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,280
Well, there you have it is doesn't sound like we even though we've had we've and it's interesting

162
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,000
you've been following the story for a little while West it's interesting you've been following this push and yet we don't really have a

163
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,080
super clear alternative that doesn't also have its set of downsides and to bring myself down and not to mention not to mention that we've

164
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,480
now got decades of

165
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,560
R&D and x86 and software built around and all of that speaking of decades speaking of decades

166
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,840
That whole scope versus Linux. I don't believe what you've read. It's actually still around again

167
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,240
Yeah, the scope versus IBM is alive 13 years later and continuing now

168
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,780
If you know what you might not even have been alive if you're listening to this show when this lawsuit started

169
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:09,720
So I had its core the sco group which was then named caldera systems filed a lawsuit against IBM in March of 20

170
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
I'm sorry 2003

171
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,160
for allegedly contributing to

172
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,600
contributing sections of the commercial Unix code from the Unix system in it to

173
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:25,280
Scos from sco to the Linux kernel code base sco group claimed that they alleged presence of its proprietary code in the open source

174
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,560
Code named Linux devalued its proprietary codes value

175
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,800
And so therefore they were suing IBM for that along the way sco filed for bankruptcy and the group claimed that anyone who used Linux

176
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,520
owed them money all the while novell successfully claimed ownership of the allegedly infringing code and then said okay everybody's gonna be

177
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,760
Indemnified from it if you run on Linux

178
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,060
But all of that has not stopped the sco group from continuing its battle with IBM the group on Wednesday

179
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,060
Which is last Wednesday did not actually

180
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:59,140
Reveal the nature of their appeal only as a solely as a solely as a notice to the appeals court that they would be lodging an

181
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,940
appeal soon

182
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,100
So they're not it's not sco versus IBM

183
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,340
Which is one of the oldest stories I've been following is still not done. It's still not done

184
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,980
It's unbelievable one of the first stories tracked for a Linux action show

185
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,780
really incredible

186
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,900
All right, I don't want to go into all the April Fool's this week last this past week

187
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:25,180
There was a lot of April Fool's shenanigans, but one I thought was particularly good because you know

188
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:31,120
Like what ThinkGeek does is ThinkGeek has these products sometimes as April Fool's and then people want it so much that ThinkGeek actually ends up

189
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,580
Making it. I

190
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,000
Think that's what can happen to the KDE project the KDE project

191
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,660
I think ended up with an April Fool's that they're gonna have to make

192
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:45,240
They the on April 1st. They posted plasma 5.7 will let you log in through an online account

193
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,560
KDE is going to provide an own cloud installation to let plasma and KDE PIM users sync their data

194
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,940
You can already use own cloud with Car Dev and Cal Dev

195
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,960
To get at your calendars and things like that synced

196
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,240
And now and now you will be able to use own cloud to sync plasma

197
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Configurations and manage them work will be when your work is completed

198
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,360
You'll be able to load a plasma session by specifying units username and password and own cloud provider

199
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:17,760
that's right, and then you can log into your KD desktop and have your settings synced via own cloud in plasma 5.7 a

200
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,360
Massive feature West a massive feature now. I kind of want it. I know right so did everybody else so ha ha April Fool's

201
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,520
That was a super funny April Fool's everybody super funny April Fool's

202
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
What was the Ubuntu one I don't remember that

203
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,560
It wasn't Ubuntu one the thing of the cloud that you could also put your backups in there

204
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,040
a

205
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,840
Service that was discontinued at some point. Yes, your box like yes

206
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,280
Yeah, now, but I got enough people's attention

207
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,760
They say they're actually it happened that they were already be going to be meeting at the at their

208
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:57,640
Vdg you know the developers group meeting that they have and so like people are really excited about this April Fool's

209
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,240
And so they looked at it like God you know there might actually be ways

210
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,000
We could actually accomplish some of this now not the login stuff

211
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,160
But integrating more syncing stuff a better place to store stuff in own cloud

212
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,640
It looks like they were actually looked at some of the ideas from the April Fool's and went

213
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,600
Maybe we're trying to be negative. It just seems like a huge expense for very little benefit

214
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,880
Well, not the login part not the login part, but some of the other files thinking stuff

215
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Wendy you were you were mentioning Google's April Fool's that didn't go over so well I

216
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,960
Heard some people got really upset about that

217
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,720
Did you go where'd you go Wimpy? Where'd you go? Oh, hi. Hi

218
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,760
I I think the people at Google need to remember they've been employed to be

219
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:50,680
Kick-ass engineers and various other roles and none of them are employed employed to be full-time comedians

220
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah, and they should just knock this on the head. It's very tiresome and

221
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,680
You know, they're April Fool's this year a couple of them went bad and none of them were very good

222
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,280
What happened to the halcyon days of the Google April Fool's like, you know, Google Glass and Nexus Q. I mean, those were cracking

223
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,440
I agree

224
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,120
and you know

225
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,120
Those are hilarious. I

226
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,200
Saw some people that were tweeting like they were writing like condolences emails to people who had

227
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,840
To family members who had had somebody passed away and it inserted that mic drop thing

228
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,480
And anyways people were upset so it might be some fun stuff coming out of plasma soon

229
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,840
And also Katie has come up with a vision for the future that well

230
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,480
I'll read it to you the Katie statement for their vision is a world in which everyone has control over their digital life and enjoys

231
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,040
freedom and privacy

232
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,120
They go more expanded it goes on but in greater detail their vision has no geographical barriers

233
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,480
Katie should be able to be available to everyone

234
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,560
Katie wants to put their users in the driver's seat and Katie wants people to control all aspects of their digital lives

235
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,320
Okay

236
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,720
Hard to object to that is the Katie E vision and you can find out more at dot Katie e.org

237
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,280
And this is kind of an interesting thing. I wonder I wonder so the group that put this together

238
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,680
I wonder how much connection this actually has to people that are actually writing code

239
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,160
That's always something I kind of wonder when I when I watch the Katie project from afar

240
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,520
I I get kind of confused about what is

241
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:20,320
actually directly connected to the project and what is just sort of like people who are associated with the project that do in the project's name and

242
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,520
I've been running the plasma 5 6 desktop since about

243
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,120
Five days since before plasma 5 6 or maybe seven days before plasma 5 6 was released to final and now I've been right

244
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,000
I've been running it since then so I guess I'm coming on like I must be on almost a month now and

245
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,040
Just recently. I'm starting to have issues on this Intel skylake machine

246
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:45,720
But I I have I have really I have really profoundly changed my position on the plasma desktop and it no longer

247
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,480
With each release of the plasma desktop

248
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,360
I have felt like there's just a couple of things that were really fundamentally broken didn't work for me for a while

249
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,640
It was sound was really bad

250
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,840
Didn't be able to go in there and understanding like when they at one point

251
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,480
I think it was like in five four or five five when they updated the sound or the multimedia

252
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,120
system

253
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,040
Control panel where you could go and disable hardware devices. It was a process of elimination. I could make the right sound card work

254
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,320
That was a huge game-changer for me and when the stability got so that way I didn't just when they when the session was idle

255
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,000
I would sometimes just have the plasma shell crash when those things stopped happening

256
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,360
You know, that was another game-changer for me. And so five six has been really a great great release

257
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,560
But at the same time as much as I see improvement

258
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,600
I see a lot a lot of room for continued improvement still and I think that's a big thing

259
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
room for continued improvement still and

260
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,800
last week we covered a mailing post that mr. Brown who is in our

261
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,080
Mumble room right now who hails us from the Sousa project wrote up

262
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,080
And I he sent it in to the KDE mailing list

263
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,040
And and if you guys recall he talked about how there's multiple text editors and multiple start menus

264
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,080
And there's there's so much going on in there that it might meet a little refinement and I don't want to actually make it too

265
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,280
clumsy, so mr. Brown if you wanted to

266
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,600
Maybe just really recap really briefly for our audience who didn't catch the episode last week kind of what your message was in this mailing

267
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
list post

268
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,560
Because I thought it nailed my thoughts

269
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,680
I thought you were actually really able to verbalize some of the things that I've been thinking

270
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,760
In a really clear cognizant way that wasn't hostile that came from a place of I love what you're doing

271
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,960
I love everything we've accomplished, but we still have room to go

272
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,560
And so would you mind summarizing your post really quick for the audience? Yeah, I don't mind at all

273
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,960
I mean, yeah, it comes from a lot of the discussions. We're having with the KDE project at the moment about

274
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,320
well their relationships with distributions, you know some pain points with our

275
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,680
packages and stuff like that and the the conversation kind of ended up talking a little bit broader about sort of

276
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,800
just distribution positioning and stuff generally and

277
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,000
Yeah, the the key message that I wanted to kind of get across is yeah, there's parts of the KDE stack which are

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,880
Absolutely phenomenal and of good quality and great. But if you look at kind of KD is a whole

279
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,920
It's hard to get a handle on

280
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,960
What the project is trying to do. It's it's

281
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,720
And and if you ask like three different KDE developers you generally get three different answers on pretty much everything

282
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,480
I mean

283
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,880
You made a point that that clearly translates to what the what that happens is the KD project and the plasma desktop is not

284
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:24,160
Messaging to the distros what's awesome about the plasma desktop so then they can't turn around and and and relay that to their users

285
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,720
they don't they don't there's like a disconnect there and

286
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,320
So that's sort of the big problem when you said the big with the end result is is KDE actually has to is KD doesn't

287
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,460
Just market to end-user. It also has to market to distro makers themselves, too

288
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,720
Yeah, and there's like little snippets and like little glimmers of what I think is a wonderful

289
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,480
I don't use the word vision because they're using it now at mission goal, whatever

290
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,000
of

291
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,320
like

292
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,680
from what some of their plasma maintainers of like just thinking of plasma as a

293
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,720
Workspace and thinking of the applications of something different and if you think of it as something different, which is

294
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,120
clearly a mindset that some of the KDE project have a

295
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,800
Lot of these problems and pain points go away because all of these duplicate applications are certainly available to not be included

296
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,240
You know if you stop thinking of KDE is a huge stack

297
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:17,080
But as a pick-and-mix selection of technologies, you might want to put in your distribution

298
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,600
Things get really exciting again. Sure. The whole project isn't angled in that direction yet. The messaging is not there

299
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,040
Well, you know what you think of link as an end-user when you think of the plasma desktop, don't you aren't you?

300
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,480
Isn't one of the things you think about is how well all the applications integrate and how they all play off each other and how it's a

301
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,160
Whole suite. I mean when I think of the KDE desktop, I think of plasma 5-6. I think of

302
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,760
All of the text editors. I even maybe consider k-office included in that

303
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,480
I mean, I think of the entire suite when I think of the plasma desktop

304
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,720
You think that way but the KDE project is no longer working in that way

305
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,840
So it's is that a smart thing to have those expectations so far divorced from each other

306
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,640
If you haven't got maintainers on the KDE side maintaining all of that stuff to the same level as the plasma guys and the K

307
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,800
Wing guys

308
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Aren't you setting yourself up for?

309
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,280
Disappointment and failure or something, right? Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. That's actually a great point

310
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,680
So but how does a project like KDE which?

311
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,400
Has been labeled in the past as a bit chaotic

312
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,800
How does a project like that come together and say we're gonna we're gonna unite around a single editor

313
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:30,540
We're gonna unite around a single this or that or is that the job of a distribution and and if that's a job of distribution

314
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,540
Why has it never happened?

315
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:38,300
Yeah, that's it. That's a tough answer. I mean the I think there was room in KDE for

316
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,140
Some kind of leadership in that area of like just people stepping up and saying okay, we're gonna make some of these tough choices

317
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,460
It won't make those people friends just like some of the changes no mate

318
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,380
It didn't make necessarily make certain people friends, but in the long run it's proven to be a pretty good thing. I

319
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,700
Think that might be part of it

320
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:03,060
The other part of the distributions is the other stuff that we were talking about before we got on to this conversation of like these

321
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,860
I was gonna say a hundred paper cuts

322
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:11,260
But at the moment it feels a bit more like a thousand of like just living with the KDE stack packaging the KDE stack handling

323
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:19,560
You know new new yeah new dependencies new changes and and we're having a bit of a hard time getting that communication from

324
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:25,700
Them as the developers of like what are they expecting from us? What where what dependencies do they need?

325
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,420
What versions of X Y & Z we just get these big old?

326
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,620
Tables and it's expected to get it out there and they you know uses hands as fast as possible and

327
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
That can be really tough sometimes

328
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,020
Yeah, absolutely now you also

329
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:48,500
Really effectively broke down the rather dominant position that GTK based desktops are in versus Qt based desktops

330
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,860
And I find that to be

331
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,020
Not not shocking and not a huge surprise

332
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,700
but if you walk into a room of Linux nerds and

333
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
You ask people to raise their hands on

334
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,340
What they prefer Qt or GTK a lot of people are gonna raise their hands for Qt

335
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:10,420
In terms of application development a lot of people say like Qt is superior or cute yet

336
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,860
Right exactly yeah, yeah, and I'm kind of in the same

337
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,540
I'm using plasma right now, but I I'm kind of in the same boat so what what's going on here?

338
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:30,500
Why has Gnome or GTK desktops essentially dominated the the top positions on distro watch and the and the larger distros?

339
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,380
When plasma desktops been around for a long time the Qt technology is pretty advanced

340
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,000
You have folks like canonical who are investing a ton of resources into it. What are your thoughts there? I?

341
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,340
think it's a case of

342
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,740
just like hitting that sweet spot of the

343
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,060
implementation like if you think of the

344
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:55,180
many of like the core audiences of Linux these days we're talking about you know tablets and stuff earlier and mobile devices if you if

345
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,300
You think about you know who is using a Linux desktop these days

346
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,300
You typically have like you know developers techies sysadminis guys who?

347
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,720
generally fall into one or two camps either sort of the

348
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:15,860
Lightweight guys who just want the most simple window manager or whatever that can you know just does the thing that is meant to do

349
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,060
And you know probably some old-school stuff that no one's seen for 10 years or seen an upgrade for for 10 years

350
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,260
And then you have another lot who just want

351
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:29,220
Something that keeps out of their way, and I think most of the GTK ones generally do that in a very elegant way

352
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:36,800
The KDE appeals to you know these control freaks who want all these options and all these buttons and everything

353
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:44,780
But does that necessarily overlap with like the most of the core than its users these days. I'm I'm not so sure

354
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,780
and

355
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,780
I actually want to give a chance for daredevil and jump here because daredevil and you say to maybe it's it's the money

356
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,600
There's more money behind GTK. What do you mean there?

357
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:01,420
I mean that there is just as much money being poured like cute has the support of the corporation DJ right and

358
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:08,820
GTK has just supported red hat that's not a small feat. That's not a small amount of engineering in there and when you look at

359
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,740
That money being poured into hey

360
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,220
This if you're going to make an application

361
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:21,180
That is going to work in in your company, and you're already using those red hats or this fedora

362
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,820
You know it's just that they document in a way, and there's also the cycles

363
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:36,700
Just remember that there's also still the very first reason why GTK was created is you know there was the doubts about the licensing now?

364
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,860
There's no longer many doubts about licensing

365
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:44,180
But there is an attempt to you know show a different path to a different license on you

366
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,340
It's not necessarily the GTK camp. Yeah, that's good. That's a good point

367
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:53,120
Richard also, it's not just red hat that you know have money behind and you know GTK

368
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,460
You know Susan the next enterprise also standardized on them with the last release

369
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,740
Well, that is a perfect segue to my next question question Richard

370
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,580
so this is semi awkward here now all of a sudden because

371
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:10,820
Everybody kind of thinks of open Sousa as primarily as focusing on the KDE plasma desktop

372
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,500
But your enterprise distribution is focused on the known desktop

373
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:21,260
You kind of talked about this a little bit is is this requiring Sousa open Sousa to pivot more towards user demand or?

374
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,580
Do you play the role as a desktop advocate here and try to get more people to try the plasma desktop?

375
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:32,020
What what decision does open Sousa make in light of the reality of GTK's?

376
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,220
market predominance and

377
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,380
apparent user preference in some cases

378
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,860
Well first

379
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:47,220
I guess it's clear to say like Sousa's business decision regarding the enterprise distribution is like totally separate from open Sousa like in the sense

380
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,100
Of like Sousa made this decision about NOMA as a default quite a while ago. They did it for 11 as well

381
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,300
And at the same time the open Sousa community had a discussion made their decision

382
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,740
went and stuck with KDE and

383
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,420
And you know where open Sousa is always free to go its own road

384
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,380
Do you know make its own decisions and we have an absolutely awesome KDE team?

385
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,220
I mean to be blunt the best KDE team out there

386
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,300
Doing a wonderful job of packaging all of this stuff despite the stuff that I've been complaining about

387
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,580
Yeah, and you know, it's if you want a KDE expense

388
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,980
It's the best one that where that comes to like what does open Sousa do in the future?

389
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:30,260
we I at times coming that we'll probably end up having a discussion about this soon and I

390
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,940
Think there's some really interesting options to put on the table like in the case of tumbleweed

391
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,500
because one of the things with the community with open Sousa is we're not the

392
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:45,900
Perception that we are KDE first has always been wrong. We've always treated every desktop equally

393
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,860
So do we put KDE on there?

394
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,740
Do we put no desktop as a default in some example in the case of time?

395
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,220
We might be able to get away with that. It might make sense since it reflects the community as we are

396
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,420
but for the leap

397
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,780
Probably not. Hmm. What makes the difference there?

398
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,300
Just the target audience of leap of you know being an easier

399
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,900
Not rolling less techie user friendly distribution

400
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,660
I see

401
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,100
I mean

402
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:20,220
We could maybe put no default there that that's another thing that I kind of stumbled on when I was writing all this stuff to

403
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,140
Kde like there's a lot of distros out there that don't have a default

404
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,060
Um, you know, we thought we were crazy thinking about it. Maybe it's an idea to go for that

405
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,740
Yeah, I guess so. I I think you know the idea of the default desktop

406
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:37,660
I mean doesn't it feel like that idea comes from we are gonna put all of our focus on this

407
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:42,380
We're gonna do our theming our customization all of our effort goes into this

408
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:49,260
Which is really kind of a commercial company way of thinking because it's really a we only have 10 developers to do this

409
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:54,460
So we must put all of our energy into this desktop in the reality though in open source

410
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,280
You may have multiple contributors that want to work on multiple desktops. And so you can ship multiple desktops

411
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,340
Is that true or is there an advantage of just focusing on one desktop?

412
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,460
Which I think is where that kind of mentality comes from

413
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,620
I think if you ask other projects you'll say focus is the way to go in the case of openSUSE

414
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,800
We've been doing this now for 10 years of the the traditional

415
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,340
Every developer, you know as long as we have contributors

416
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,020
We will do it and we'll find a way to do it. And if we have two sets of contributors pulling in two different directions

417
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:27,540
We find a way of doing it together and that's like one of the things that we're exceptionally good at doing these days

418
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
so for us

419
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:36,300
That's fine. But then you do have to think about the user experience of like, okay some guy puts in your DVD boots it up

420
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,180
Do you really want to shove a desktop selection window right in front of them when they have no idea what all those options mean?

421
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,380
so this sort of moving on from this I guess I

422
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,620
Kind of wanted to ask you just as a follow-up to last week's I think it was 138. We talked about this

423
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:00,080
What do you think would be the major breakthrough to make to make the floodgates open for people to move say from

424
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:07,340
The Ubuntu desktop or the Fedora desktop or whatever and say, you know what this time this time I install this machine

425
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,280
I'm doing openSUSE and I last week. I think I made it into the show

426
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,620
I'm not sure if I made in the final version

427
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:20,300
I proposed that the thing that might finally break those floodgates open is universal application installs across Linux because if all of a sudden

428
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,300
software availability was sort of

429
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,520
the same across all of the major distributions

430
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,540
then you could start picking your distro on other things like technical merits and

431
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,580
You might see a lot more people picking openSUSE

432
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,460
it seems like right now one of the barriers is software availability despite all of the

433
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,080
Nice tricks in and means you got a long way

434
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,480
But despite that it seems like that might still be the thing that holds up a lot of people

435
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,360
But I don't know Richard what your thoughts are

436
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,080
As far as if there could be a big shift that would all of a sudden make it much easier

437
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,840
Less friction for people to start jumping to SUSE

438
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,840
Yeah, I think I think that's part of it. I mean we've been thinking about the software availability thing from sort of the other direction of

439
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:08,800
Tidying up some of the rough edges around like software.openSUSE.org and the OBS and then bits and pieces like that

440
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,040
The the universal application stuff is is interesting. I'm

441
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,920
Parenthetically worried about the baggage it might bring you know libraries that need patching and maintaining and all the other stuff

442
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,920
we

443
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,680
We've got some expertise in that area because we've been playing around with like Docker

444
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,880
We have zippers the only package manager that can patch inside a Docker container, for example. Wow

445
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:39,780
Kind of fun. So, you know, maybe we end up, you know patching inside application containers too and having fun with that but

446
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,880
So yeah, I think it's it's part of the story

447
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,040
But I think in the case of openSUSE of the the main part has actually been sort of actually having it like a consistent story

448
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
The same thing that I'm being criticized in KDE about

449
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,120
You know

450
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,900
I know that's been a weakness for openSUSE in the past and I think we're finding our feet without getting that message out

451
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,720
It's just a case of taking time listening to feedback

452
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,800
iterating tuning

453
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,800
One last question and then I'm gonna I'll toss it air devil

454
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,880
and I think we're I'm and then anything you want to bring up but my the

455
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,040
last week the thing that really got my head spinning was Microsoft's announcement of bash on Windows and

456
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:19,820
To mr. Popey's delight. They specifically said you can run Ubuntu apps on Windows

457
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,200
In fact, I think when you run the user land now

458
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:28,880
In the command prompt when you type bash up in the little window. It says Ubuntu as if the application

459
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:36,040
You're running is Ubuntu and Ubuntu is now an application in your in your task taskbar Ubuntu with a little Ubuntu logo and

460
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,720
On Windows and I'm wondering when you heard this announcement. Did you think to yourself?

461
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,580
Shit, I wish they would have just said the Linux command line. Why did it have to be Ubuntu?

462
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:54,020
Actually, I heard the announcement logged on to this mumbo-jumbo and asked Popey a few questions about the technical stuff because I reckon we can

463
00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:01,280
Possibly dump open Suza on top of that instead. Yeah, I would love to hear because they call the subsystem the Linux subsystem

464
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,660
They don't call it the Ubuntu subsystem. The user land is Ubuntu, but

465
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,220
Popey now last week in the show

466
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,920
We were covering the rumors that there might be bash on Windows. Did you know at that time what was coming? I

467
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,960
Didn't I knew like about an hour before?

468
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,000
They went on stage and said it and that was it

469
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,360
Uh-huh. See we got a we got to get a we got to get a line to Dustin and we got to get somebody

470
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,360
Giving him beer to give us the inside scoop. I dare Devon before we move on from mr. Brown

471
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,360
I know I wanted to get your your question

472
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,420
So no, I was just saying the universal apps one

473
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:42,280
Don't you guys think that it will change what what they mean or what it means when you now have to consider Windows platform?

474
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,280
I mean, isn't that the appeal?

475
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,720
You mean you mean that particular neck that compatibility layer now?

476
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:55,600
Wow make an application for Ubuntu and now it just works on Solaris BSD

477
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Linux your regular distro and it will work on Windows

478
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,720
Yes, when this comes yes from CLI apps they come from the graphical apps yet

479
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,880
No, but you know, someone's gonna get X working on that thing, you know, somebody's gonna get it

480
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
Well x-ming is already a thing. Oh

481
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,840
Well, I know I hope so

482
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:20,280
I wonder if somebody will takes like somehow if somebody will come will merge Sigwin with this somehow and make like just some sort

483
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,520
Of Frankenstein said an unholy Linux box, right? You know exactly what I'm thinking about

484
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,680
Richard was there anything else you wanted to touch on before we move along?

485
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:36,000
All right, sir, well, thank you for joining us and I thought that was a great post well-written and it was it was really

486
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,760
well stated too and I hope the KD project takes up some of your suggestions and we

487
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,920
We will just have to wait and see I will mention DigitalOcean sponsor right here of the Linux unplugged program

488
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,160
Hey, yo, Wes. Do you have any DigitalOcean droplets? Oh, you know I do

489
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,240
Yeah, I do. You know, I have own cloud running up on DigitalOcean right now

490
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,440
I got the I got the version 9 running, you know the version 9

491
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,800
They got a one-click deployment now of own cloud night one click. That's fast. Boom. Boom

492
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,200
I tell you what DigitalOcean is great

493
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,280
It's a great way for you to get your own Linux rig up in the cloud

494
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,040
They call it the cloud but really what they magical place

495
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,200
Well, it could be magical but really what they you know what it is. It's DigitalOcean's magical servers

496
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,160
They have they have data centers all over the world totally specked out

497
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,000
They have them in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Germany. They have a new one in India

498
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,440
40 gigabit e connections to the hypervisors what all SSDs

499
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,400
super fast CPUs Linux on the entire

500
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,320
infrastructure KVM for the virtualizer and then all sitting on top of it is this incredible web app and

501
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
It is so well designed

502
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,560
but yet extremely powerful and then to top it all off like sprinkles on top of a cupcake for Wes's birthday an

503
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:58,320
API that is straightforward and easy to it is so easy with lots of great open source code already written taken advantage of dat

504
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,320
API I love their interface and I love this if you use our promo code do unplugged

505
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,800
You get a $10 credit $10 credit over at DigitalOcean to save yourself when you're trying it out

506
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,120
I have DigitalOcean also running an EMR application

507
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,480
Well, I think it's called open EMR actually they'd like the name is not all that creative

508
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,720
but my lady runs a medical practice and

509
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,080
Noah set up one for her a while back and she tried it out for a little while

510
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,160
He did the same thing he spun up a DigitalOcean droplet

511
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,540
But the first thing you do she wasn't really ready to try it then he was being a little pushy

512
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,920
You know how Noah can be you know how I mean, I'm just saying I know it's a good guy

513
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,080
But he can be intense. So she's

514
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,960
Yeah, I hope so. I hope so. I said I'm not quite ready

515
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,920
She thought you know, but now now she's ready to jump in. It just takes seconds

516
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,920
I'm a busy guy with and the fact that I can manage my DigitalOcean droplets. It melts my freaking face

517
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,280
It is so great and when you use a promo code do unplugged you can try it out

518
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,200
Their pricing is very straightforward. You can just do hourly pricing. You can go get a big rig

519
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,360
Here's a fun one. I would I would totally suggest you use DigitalOcean to set up a mumble server

520
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,560
If you have not played with mumble for yourself, it is a great open source

521
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,000
Voice chat program. It's what your friends just chat or your own virtual log

522
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,440
it's what we do for our virtual log our virtual log uses mumble running on a DigitalOcean droplet and

523
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,760
It works great people connect from all over the world to that DigitalOcean droplet and it runs all the time

524
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,400
DigitalOcean.com use their HTML 5 console to manage your box or their API or their fantastic interface

525
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,520
They got Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, CorOS, and even that free BSD

526
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,680
They already have tutorials popping up on their site too for 1604. They're on top of it. DigitalOcean.com

527
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,080
Just use that promo code

528
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:48,280
Do unplugged one word a lowercase and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the unplugged program

529
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,000
and many many of our friends out there in the open source world are also taking advantage of

530
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:59,120
DigitalOcean either as like DigitalOcean sponsoring them by providing the server hosting

531
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:06,800
Or they're just already choosing to run off them. In fact, I recall I think I think wimpy uses DigitalOcean for some Ubuntu Mate

532
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,320
stuff and

533
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,840
Speaking of Ubuntu Mate it is a new month

534
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:19,760
And so we look back at the month of March and we see that the Ubuntu Mate project has had yet

535
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,000
once again another good month and

536
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:29,000
wimpy has outlined how he'll be spending the monies or how the monies were spent I guess better put and

537
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,640
I wanted to just let him jump in. Is there anything from the update you wanted to share with the audience wimpy?

538
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:39,240
Well, those people that are following the blog they can see all of that stuff in there see where the money's going

539
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,880
we've put some aside because

540
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,680
we've got the

541
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:49,760
1604 a couple of weeks away and we'll be releasing the Raspberry Pi images for that

542
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,920
We anticipate a spike in downloads and that gets expensive. So we're

543
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,120
We put some money aside to cater for those downloads

544
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,040
You know, I think I I've been thinking about what it is about these updates that

545
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,240
I like, I mean, I like knowing but it's not just that what I like is

546
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,520
I assume it's true

547
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:16,000
But whether it's true or not you give the impression of a financially stable and financially sustainable distribution

548
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,120
Exactly and as somebody who's been watching distributions come and go for a long time

549
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,240
I makes me feel good about that distribution that you have a sustainable path here

550
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,520
But I wanted to kind of I actually wanted to push you a little bit on that

551
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,080
I wanted to kind of I actually wanted to push you a little bit on two of the line items you have here because I

552
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:39,840
Don't know what these mean and they sound really interesting. So Luke got got some cash for working on a buntu Matei

553
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,240
Welcome that's very generic wimpy because a buntu Matei welcome has been a project you've been working on for a long time

554
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,840
What did you want to share any specifics because I was curious. I would like to know what did he do?

555
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:57,240
Well, he's effectively the principal developer for a buntu Matei. Welcome and the software boutique now

556
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,240
So it's it's really

557
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,080
Luke falls into the category of people that really doesn't isn't interested in the money doesn't want the money

558
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:13,240
And this is just a way of me saying thank you for the hours and hours of effort that he's put into

559
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:17,920
The project, you know and also, you know, he's the forum

560
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,720
Administrator in the community. So he's he's taken on a lot of responsibility and it's just nice to say

561
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,200
Thank you for all the time and effort. Well, I would bested into the project

562
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,560
I would say Luke you have helped create one of the best software centers or

563
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:40,680
Deployment tools for Linux that I have ever used. Absolutely. I think it's fair to say that he hasn't helped. This is Luke's imagining

564
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,680
so I

565
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,360
Started the ball rolling in 1510

566
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,440
and Luke's involvement is kind of interesting because

567
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,480
Very very early on when welcome was really really fresh and new early in the 1510 cycle

568
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,520
He posted a mock-up in the forum of the rolling in logo

569
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:07,040
Animation that you see in the 1510 right buntu Matei welcome and I said, oh that would be so great

570
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,520
If you implement that and the next day there was a pull request and he'd implemented it all and the rest of it

571
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:19,080
and that kind of sparked his involvement and then I didn't hear much from him and then as the

572
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,880
1604 cycle started I got this colossal pull request

573
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,280
And he clearly spent weeks, you know working on it and it was just this

574
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
BAM

575
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,840
This is what I've been doing for the last I don't know how long and it was just like, okay

576
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,120
And all of a sudden like wow, we've got something for 1604 here. That's great. Yeah

577
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:46,320
Yeah, and so and and he was very clear, you know, he he he got what welcome was all about. He

578
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,920
Totally understood why it was important and he really wanted to go for it

579
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:56,760
So I kind of stepped back a little bit from active development

580
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,120
I've had a hand in it, but he has really driven

581
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:06,040
buntu Matei welcome and the software boutique in 1604 with the help of

582
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:14,040
Robin Thompson as well who I approached to help us with the translation work that we've been working on the last six weeks or so

583
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:21,480
So also I noticed that it looks like there's been some continued effort to porting Matei desktop to GTK 3

584
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,720
Yep. Yep. So the upstream guys Wolfgang and Vlad

585
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,920
And another guy called Luke who I don't have any active contacts with

586
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:37,880
but Luke from DC, I think you go by on github. You really need to get in touch with me

587
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,240
I need to reach out and say thank you to you for all of your hard work as well

588
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:48,360
But yeah, the the three of them have been working tirelessly for months and months

589
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,960
To really refine the GTK 3 implementation

590
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,320
And I think the target at the moment more or less is that

591
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,600
Matei desktop 1.14 will be released in about a week's time

592
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:10,600
And it should be the first one that has a stable GTK 3 implementation for those people that want to build against GTK 3

593
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,280
That is exciting impressive GTK 3.20 is the

594
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,680
Version that they're targeted so they've worked really really hard on that

595
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,480
So you want to chat a little bit about

596
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,560
Some Raspberry Pi stuff. I know that you've been working on several different things in that regard

597
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,360
I don't know how much you want to talk about what you want to share, but

598
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,480
There's several things that are would be pretty interesting to the audience

599
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:41,880
Yeah, yeah, that's my sort of favorite favorite pet project. I like tinkering with the Raspberry Pi. I have lots of

600
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,200
Friends with Raspberry Pi. We like you tinkering with the Raspberry Pi

601
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah, it's lots of fun. So

602
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,120
Yeah, I alluded to the fact there'll be a Raspberry Pi release for

603
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,300
1604 for Ubuntu Matei

604
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,920
And I will also build the same versions that we've had before

605
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,000
So I've made versions of the

606
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,200
Ubuntu, you know traditional Ubuntu server

607
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,540
And also Lubuntu and Xubuntu images

608
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:20,060
for those people that want to play with those and I think a couple of months ago

609
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,860
We were talking about this stuff and I alluded to the fact that you know

610
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:30,460
There was some experimental work going on from the Raspberry Pi foundation with accelerated drivers for the video core

611
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,220
for

612
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:39,580
Chip and that you know, if that went well, then we could potentially start seeing some of the composited desktops running on the Raspberry Pi 3

613
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:47,100
So I've spent a couple of evenings playing with that and having some fun with that. Yeah, and how has that gone would be?

614
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,460
Well, I've got to the point where

615
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:55,580
so at the moment I I can boot and

616
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,220
run in air quotes

617
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,660
Ubuntu Unity, Kubuntu and

618
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,420
Ubuntu

619
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,620
Gnome

620
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:09,740
1604 on the Raspberry Pi 3. Wow, that's awesome

621
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,780
Oh boy, the Raspberry Pi 3 is getting awfully appealing all of a sudden

622
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:24,140
Now it's it's progress because in 1510 that just wasn't possible

623
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:30,060
And the video core 4 drivers are still very experimental

624
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,340
so

625
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:37,980
None of those desktops are what you would call usable. Okay, they're kind of interesting

626
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,580
You know little moose bush and and I'm sure it'll improve so over the course of the year

627
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:48,700
Have you seen my plasma desktop? It literally is glitching out all over the place right now

628
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,660
So actually the the k the kubuntu thing

629
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:59,420
Uh, I don't I don't really i'm not really familiar with it the issue there and this isn't a kde

630
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:06,140
Issue it's you know, it's the uh video core 4 drivers, you know that there are some rough edges there

631
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:11,660
Right. So some of the rendering's not right. So right some of the icons and some of the fonts are a bit

632
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,220
You can't make them out

633
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,780
But when I can get it to do stuff the animations are

634
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:23,900
Just silky smooth just perfect. Nice. You you can't complain. Um

635
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:31,580
On ubuntu unity that generally works. Um, I although when I tried to take a screenshot of the desktop

636
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:36,220
That locks something up. So that's why I had to take a photograph of

637
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,860
Of that one running rather than a screenshot

638
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:45,340
Um, but you know that broadly works, um kubuntu works, but I don't know if it's going to work

639
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:51,420
But you know that broadly works, um kubuntu works, but I can't make it out where ubuntu

640
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,500
Uh has better, you know, it doesn't have the rendering glitches

641
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,940
Um, it has some other issues and then ubuntu gnome looks perfect

642
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,860
It absolutely looks perfect. There is no rendering issues whatsoever

643
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:10,380
But as soon as you launch any application the whole thing dies on its ass and it only works

644
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,820
It only works in classic mode. Oh, okay. So, you know these these drivers are

645
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:23,580
Evolving so they'll get there in in in due course, but it kind of whet my appetite. So i've i've now started

646
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,640
Experimenting with some of the other acceleration

647
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,140
Uh facilities that are available on the raspberry pi

648
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,860
Two and well, in fact all the raspberry pies

649
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:38,320
But obviously i'm targeting the the two and the three because of the ubuntu base supporting that architecture

650
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:45,680
And uh, so i'm now working on uh video playback acceleration and that's a much happier story

651
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,160
Now this could be huge because uh, a lot of people that i've heard in the audience that have tried the pie

652
00:49:52,960 --> 00:50:00,320
For a media center said it is great. It is great when you're watching sd content or 720p content, but

653
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,600
You get up to around 1080p and it starts to be a different story

654
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,280
And it has made the pie sort of unattractive to me as a cody box

655
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,680
Uh, and you know to be honest with you

656
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,280
Even as a production box because if I can't get 1080p playback

657
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,520
Then I can't capture at 1080 and that's no good because that's what we capture at here locally

658
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,680
Um, and so it's sort of eliminated as a possibility as even something I could have as an extra studio computer

659
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,560
Yeah, and and the other issue is is that if you have a dedicated um media center

660
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:40,260
Uh application such as um cody running on something like open elec it works very well

661
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,100
um

662
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,460
And I agree on the older models of the raspberry pi

663
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,620
um

664
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:54,180
You could comfortably do 720p and depending on the bit rate it would do 1080p. Yeah, i've never tried on the three though

665
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,740
Yeah, yeah. So this is this is what i've been playing with just recently

666
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,540
and uh

667
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,540
It's looking really good. So

668
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:08,260
There's a guy in the ubuntu mate community called

669
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,740
arrowan

670
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:16,040
Who posted a load of tips and tricks on how to compile various things with acceleration?

671
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:20,820
For the raspberry pi 3 so i'm going through his stuff and sort of

672
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:26,820
Piecing it together and filling in the blanks and what i've got going at the moment is I have um

673
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:33,460
A vlc fully accelerated. Yes for the raspberry pi 2 and the raspberry pi 3. Yes

674
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:39,460
And that's properly great. So that's using the open max api

675
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:46,500
Which is the same api that things like cody on the raspberry pi use and the omx player use

676
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:51,940
so although you've got the user interface for vlc you launch the

677
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:57,380
Um, you know pick your media player and set it playing and it immediately goes full screen

678
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:04,660
And you just use the keyboard bindings to then control the playback, but it is absolutely super slick and it is

679
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,620
It's super smooth and it works perfectly man

680
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:12,900
That's going to have big that could have a big impact for people that are using the raspberry pi in a battery situation

681
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,860
Which uh, I I could I could see a lot of people doing

682
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,660
Yeah, I mean i've got one of these um

683
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:24,900
Atrix laptops and right running on that. Yes, it's like a portable media player now. It looks fantastic

684
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,780
It's got an hdmi screen hdmi audio

685
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:33,380
Can run it off a battery. It's got a built-in battery that can power the pie. It runs for about 10 hours

686
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,900
It's just fantastic

687
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,500
Producer q5 sis has one of those atrix docs and I borrowed it for like ever from him

688
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,580
I think I think I gave it back to him now

689
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:46,100
Uh, and it is ideal. It is ideal for the raspberry pi if you could have just a way to to attach it

690
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,820
Um, and I could you know for me

691
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:54,660
I something I could I could easily connect to like different tvs in the home or in the office

692
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,900
That would then have fully

693
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:02,740
Accelerated playback that is a that is a big deal now. Is it just in vlc wimpy or is it other applications as well?

694
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,860
Yes, i've started to branch out into other stuff

695
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:11,860
So the thing about vlc is that in the past we've only been able to offer omx player, which is a command line utility

696
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:17,940
So there's a barrier to entry there. So now having vlc you can you know, right click on things launch in vlc

697
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,140
And it will just start playing or you can do it through the vlc ui

698
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,300
but um

699
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:28,580
Uh this evening i've got um a build of ffmpeg

700
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:33,060
Which is fully accelerated for the there we go. Yeah. Yeah. No

701
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,180
No, this is neat and that uses a different

702
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:44,980
Uh api this uses the uh ml which is the multimedia abstraction layer for the video core

703
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,420
chip

704
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,380
and

705
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:53,140
So you can use ffplay for example to for a command line to launch your content and that's windowed

706
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:58,200
So you can do it in full screen or you can have it in windowed and that all is fully accelerated

707
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:04,820
And I will confirm i've even seen a screenshot that actually confirms it is actually real which is yeah. Yes. Yeah

708
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:08,020
Yeah, yeah screen screenshot. Sorry. It didn't happen. Yeah, right

709
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:13,940
So the next step is uh, I should be able to compile

710
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,800
Mpv and link against that version of ffmpeg

711
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:23,240
To give a fully accelerated mpv now, would you ship that in 1604?

712
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:29,860
I don't know if i'll install these things by default ffmpeg will be included by default. Definitely vlc will

713
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:36,520
Uh mpv will be so, uh, the way that the build works is that there's a ppa stacked on top

714
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,240
So, uh, if you installed mpv

715
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:46,840
On one of those ubuntu flavors built with the ubuntu pi flavor maker you would get the accelerated version of mpv

716
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,000
and

717
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,360
I'm I i'm fairly confident I can get mpv working

718
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:58,040
And then the final step is to then build an accelerated version of kodi

719
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:05,100
Um, oh nice. Yes, which of course loads of distributions have as you know, a a dedicated

720
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,400
You know kodi box

721
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:13,320
Uh, my idea is just to build kodi in the desktop, you know version so you can run it window

722
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:18,040
Well, maybe window maybe full screen i'm not quite sure which which api to use yet

723
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,060
But the idea is is to have kodi as an install option that's fully accelerated

724
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:27,080
That would be splendid this because everyone wants that you are

725
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,880
That's a tool tool. So i'll see you like that

726
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,720
If you get this if you pull this off and I know you know, everything is subject to change

727
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,800
But if you pull this off, uh

728
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,160
You what you are going to do is you are going to apply

729
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:46,040
Bacon grease to the already incredible momentum that ubuntu mate has for the raspberry platform raspberry pi platform

730
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,120
Uh if this if these having if if I knew

731
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,640
If if I knew that there was a distro out there that I just downloaded

732
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,240
And ffmpeg was already patched to be hardware accelerated on the raspberry pi

733
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,200
That would always be the distribution. I download that would that you seal the deal right there

734
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:09,560
You already it becomes it becomes the premiere the ubuntu the mate desktop, which is obvious on a raspberry pi 3. That's obvious

735
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:16,440
combined with hardware accelerated ffmpeg or maybe even vlc and and and

736
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,920
Heaven's be perhaps kodi. Yeah

737
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,960
Whoa, this would be an un this would be an an obvious

738
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:30,040
Premier distribution for the raspberry pi and turns out there's a lot of raspberry pies out there

739
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:36,360
Is this your goal or are you just I mean this seems like almost like evil mastermind level, uh, planning

740
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:41,080
No, this is this is answering what the community has asked for

741
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:42,520
so

742
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:47,080
uh, the first goal was to make ubuntu mate, um

743
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,840
as

744
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:55,080
Useful to the makers as raspbian is so i've got lots of friends who make stuff with the raspberry pi

745
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,320
And you know, they've got

746
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,440
This is all alien to me

747
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:05,560
They've got breadboards and they've got widgets and wires and things and they glue it all together and they make stuff work

748
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:12,920
One of my friends albert made a mind mind controlled game with the raspberry pi imagine that so a headband

749
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:19,720
You put on your head and you think like flappy birds you think up down and it responds to your thoughts to play the game

750
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:25,000
So, you know epic epic levels of makers combine that with vr and you got my attention

751
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,440
Yeah, so when when I ask albert, you know does this work?

752
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,400
I've got to the point where albert is satisfied that all of the stuff he needs to do

753
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:38,440
And and isaac as well. All of these guys are from the pi podcast. They're the presenters on the pi podcast

754
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:45,800
They're like the unofficial official ubuntu mate test team. So when they tell me stuff works, i'm fairly confident it works

755
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,620
So i've kind of got all of that gpio

756
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,680
maker level stuff working really well now

757
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:58,940
And the next thing that everyone is asking for is they want kodi they want vlc

758
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,080
They want it accelerated. So that's what we're trying to do

759
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:09,720
So definitely we've got vlc done that's in the bag. We've definitely got ffmpeg that's in the bag

760
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:17,560
Um an ffmpeg is there because we use that with the youtube downloader, which is but got the gooey built in

761
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,560
and and

762
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:26,440
Next is to try and ace kodi and I make no promises about that because i've tried several times in the past and flat out failed

763
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,960
We'll see how we go. Hey, at least you're trying I guess well that is that is quite the update

764
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,160
Uh, that is that is really great. I boy i'm excited about that

765
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:42,920
um, you know, I I am uh, so i've been for for weeks now i've been using uh plasma desktop on ubuntu, um

766
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,120
And for the last two i've been using it on 1604

767
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,560
And uh now i'm switching over to unity i'm going to be running on unity until until final comes out

768
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:58,040
But I wouldn't be surprised if the one I end up on is the ubuntu mate 1604 on the apollo

769
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:03,800
Well, that just makes sense. And then when I run it on my raspberry pi 3 same exact setup. I love it wimpy

770
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,320
That's pretty cool

771
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,280
Yeah

772
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:13,160
Thank you. That's so yeah. Thank you to everyone who contributed to the project in the last month. It was really great. So we shifted

773
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:18,040
55 terabytes of downloads of raspberry pi images in march

774
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,560
What are you using to distribute 55? What did you say?

775
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,340
55 terabytes. Yeah

776
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,240
What are you using to do that just for the raspberry pi

777
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:32,760
We've got um three servers and two of them are responsible for for shifting that data

778
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:38,440
Holy smoke one in canada and one in france. You should maybe talk to alan because uh,

779
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,040
You need to move. Yeah, maybe yeah, holy smokes

780
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:46,680
Uh as somebody who moves many terabytes of data a month, too. Um

781
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,720
There are not many independent shops that are able to move that much data I am extremely impressed

782
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,160
I thought I was one of the only that got away with that. So that is

783
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:03,720
Unbelievable, that's the easy bit because you know doing large scale server stuff. That's my day job

784
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:08,120
I can do that all day long accelerating video playback and

785
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:13,800
You know plugging things into gpio ports not not so hot at that that that takes a bit more time

786
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:20,840
Yeah, but you're doing it. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Well slowly baby steps. Yeah. Oh shoot. I was just trying to look uh,

787
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,200
It's no longer. Hmm. It doesn't seem that alan no longer

788
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:29,480
He doesn't put it in there anymore alan used to put the total terabyte of transfer in the invoice

789
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,560
But I don't see it

790
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,360
But uh, yeah, it's a it's a pretty significant amount of terabytes per month

791
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,480
And so that's that's impressive wimpy just for the raspberry pi too. That's

792
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,880
Yikes, all right. Well, uh, i'll tell you what i'm gonna take a minute and tell you about my mobile service provider tang

793
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,680
You know i'm going on a road trip west road trip road trip

794
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,720
Everybody go to linux.ting.com real quick once you i'm going on a road trip

795
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,720
So you know what i'm gonna do before I go on my road trip

796
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:57,480
You know what I do. This is legit. I log into my ting dashboard and I go turn on my mi-fi line

797
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:00,040
And then I have a mi-fi

798
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,480
Yeah, it's easy. Wow. And then when i'm when i'm back from the road trip, you know what I do

799
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,880
I log in with the ting dashboard. I turn off my mi-fi

800
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,760
That's that's your boop was better than my boop. Thank you. That was a really good. That's your is that your first boop?

801
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:16,680
I think so. That was solid linux.ting.com go there and save 25 off your first device now

802
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:20,120
Why ting? Well, that is easy. No contract

803
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:26,920
No early termination fee and ladies and gentlemen, you only pay for what you use six dollars for the line

804
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,160
So I got I when I activate

805
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:34,280
So do your boop boop. No. Oh, come on. That was boop when I activate the mi-fi

806
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:40,120
That's six dollars a month and then my usage on top of that and then when I deactivate the mi-fi boop

807
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,920
No, no. Wow, you peaked dude you boop

808
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:48,840
Uh when I did when I deactivate the mi-fi then I don't pay for it at all

809
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,520
This is really nice. So I generally have about three active devices

810
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:57,800
So i'm paying six dollars a month for each line and then my usage on top of that minutes messages and megabytes

811
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:04,760
Well, guess what? We've got wi-fi right here at the jupiter broadcasting studios and guess what? I've got wi-fi at home

812
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:11,160
And i've got wi-fi when I go to angela's house. I've got wi-fi when I go see my dentist even my dentist has wi-fi, dude

813
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:17,480
Dude my dentist. Um, there is a grocery store up in the city that I live in that has wi-fi

814
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,920
The leconner grocery store has wi-fi. Wow. Yeah

815
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,960
I tell you wi-fi everywhere. Well, no

816
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:30,040
No, I don't and that's why I have ting because when i'm not on wi-fi I can choose between gsm or cdma networks

817
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:30,840
They're like, yeah

818
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,480
I look at my cellular data sort of like my backup data when I need it and I primarily and that

819
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:41,000
I because of that and rikai. He's rikai. He's like that beard is like a ninja dude

820
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,160
It like it like soaks up wi-fi signals. It's like a booster. So

821
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:51,560
Between them between us with three lines. We're doing like 37 bucks this month for our ting line. It's ridiculous

822
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:57,800
Uh, and then you combine with that dashboard ting is an unbelievable deal and great customer service

823
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:02,040
They got like these fanatical customer support reps that are going to talk to you. They're going to work with you

824
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:06,760
They'll stay on the line. They'll talk to you until the tilts completely resolved my first road trip. I went on

825
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,840
I had like a little uh sim smid mix-up or whatever

826
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,360
I don't even remember anymore because it was a while ago, but when I was going over to noah's house for the uh,

827
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,760
When he for the uh for the uh for the tour of his house with all the tech he had in there

828
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,400
I my my first day on the road or a couple days into it

829
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:26,440
I had to like troubleshoot some sort of sim issue. I don't remember what it was now and uh

830
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:32,360
Uh, there was legitimately a point 45 minutes into the call where I thought they were like gonna like well, mr

831
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,960
Fisher, thank you for you know, blah blah and I was like because there's nothing we can do

832
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,240
Yeah, I was like look you've done everything you can i've done everything I can

833
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:42,920
I understand at some point in time you got to move on and this is totally cool

834
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:49,640
And dude, I kid you not they stuck with me for another 25 minutes and uh, they went they went they went above and beyond

835
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:54,120
Uh, and they really the problem got resolved and I was back online good to go. I mean

836
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:59,160
It was like and when they had and like I think at one point like they had to call someone and they put me on

837
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:03,160
Hold and and then let me listen in on their call to them and I could hear them like telling them

838
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:08,760
What what was up and it was yeah, they were really cool. Uh, and then later on they sent me a postcard

839
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:15,080
A postcard a postcard. That was pretty cool. Uh, so and they do that

840
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,880
They I guess they do that from time to time go check them out go over there

841
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,640
Look at all the great devices they have they also on their blog just recently put up a post

842
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:27,160
I love long reviews a long review is the best kind of not these reviews where they get them five days before the device is

843
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,600
out for the public

844
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,920
Uh, but these reviews my month with the moto x pure edition that just went up on the ting blog

845
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,460
Go check them out linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring

846
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,240
the unplugged program

847
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:45,800
Linux.ting.com. Thanks you guys for going there and supporting the show by checking them out. So mr. Wes I

848
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,520
I am surprised almost every week

849
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:53,240
It seems at least for the last few weeks we have found a reason for you to have to format your hard drive and try out

850
01:04:53,240 --> 01:05:01,080
Yet another off the wall linux distribution long serving hard drive. Yeah, and this week is no different. We're going to call it. I think um,

851
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,880
Apricity apricity os apricity os

852
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,440
Uh, and it is arch based

853
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:15,080
And a gnome based desktop or cinnamon. Thank you, and it uses the power. Oh jesus going so fast

854
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:22,700
I can't read the power line shell. Uh, it's a modern intuitive operating system with the cloud integration designed for the cloud generation

855
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:28,520
And by that they mean it it ships with a lot of interesting defaults. Uh, one of them being pushbullet

856
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,320
So your android notifications are synced between you and your device

857
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,960
That is that is kind of handy, uh, you know

858
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:40,760
There's other there's other actually kind of rather nice things like they ship it with play on linux included by default

859
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:44,040
In fact, it's it's rather stacked all together all things

860
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,920
uh, it ships with a tlp for uh,

861
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,800
Battery management installed by default sync thing is installed by default. I've got it

862
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:57,000
I'm already syncing with my really with my droplet. Yep. Google chrome is installed by default not chromium

863
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,840
um, it also has uh, uh, well

864
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:07,000
A rather design heavy desktop. I have it running here in a virtual machine west has it there running on a desktop

865
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,560
So if you're watching the video version i'm gonna pull it up here

866
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,480
So you guys can just kind of see here. Let me

867
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:16,520
Log in with my super secure. I have like a demo review password that I use. It's funny

868
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,880
So i'll zoom out a little bit I apologize here, you know what I will remote in

869
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,840
And uh, I will i'll turn off the lower third just for a second

870
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,560
So you guys can see the whole uh, you can see the whole desktop there

871
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:32,840
So there you can see I have it running in boxes under my kde desktop here. I'll go full screen

872
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,440
Why not what could go wrong?

873
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:39,000
And it kind of reminds me almost immediately of elementary os because it has a dock along the bottom

874
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,480
It has the transparent top pretty clean. Yeah

875
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:47,400
Um, but what do you think west so as somebody who doesn't uh, your daily driver doesn't run arch

876
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:53,720
But you've probably ran arch on many occasions everything else in my life mostly does. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's nice

877
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:59,640
I'm i'm enjoying it. I've kind of already got everything replaced. I'm you know doing the show from and i've got irc back up

878
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,800
Uh, it was very easy to get installed and going and since it's arch

879
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:08,760
Uh, you know, you can just one tick enable the aur in their little add or remove software

880
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,040
Or I can have pacman on the command line like i'm always used to

881
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,040
now, um

882
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,760
You and I both thought the installer was pretty nice pretty clean

883
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,640
Did you recognize that as an installer from anything else?

884
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,760
I didn't either. I didn't recognize it now

885
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:27,880
It felt so well done that it must have it felt like it must be a fork of

886
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:32,440
And the only reason i'm saying this is because it usually takes a couple of years for an installer to be pretty well

887
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:37,000
Flushed out to be one of those areas. Yeah. Yeah, and uh, this seemed like

888
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:42,920
a pretty spot-on good installer and it handled, uh my partitioning just fine it

889
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:44,680
The only thing it didn't do that, you know

890
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:50,120
I've come to expect from a modern day installer is it didn't appropriately detect my time zone. Oh, yeah

891
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:54,840
Yeah, it didn't didn't for me either. But yeah, but let me set it. I mean that would probably yeah, exactly

892
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,320
Super easy. It's not a big deal. But I mean that's just like one grub screen was really nice polished

893
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:02,360
It found my other and so did you know because i'm writing a vm

894
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:04,680
I might not I might not begin the same experience as you did

895
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,920
But if for mine my grub screen kind of in fact, I could reboot right now and just show the audience

896
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:14,600
Uh, my grub screen kind of looks like the gnome 3 login screen like it's that same color and that tech that great textures

897
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:18,280
That would all right. Yeah, so right there so it kind of and then when it boots up

898
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:22,440
That's the same color and the same general look you're going to get your login screen

899
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:29,480
Now I don't get I just get a text boot here. Do you get any kind of graphical like a plinth type boot? And you know

900
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:34,360
I'm not sure you haven't rebooted yet. Well, I did once but yeah nonsense then. Yeah. Okay, that's fine

901
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,280
Yeah, so it's um apricity I guess it's kind of a new distro

902
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:45,080
Based on arch. It does have its own repos. I haven't really dug into that too much

903
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,400
I probably should because that's always kind of an achilles heel of these kinds of things but

904
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:53,420
These this is an interesting trend where you have these super design distributions

905
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,520
And I think that was kind of what I found to be interesting about this

906
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:01,160
So you got solace right? You got elementary os those are kind of two of the jump to mine

907
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,160
But there's many others that are very design heavy

908
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:10,600
And x-metal says that it reminds him of in a mix between elementary and antigross which I could see that too because it's similar to

909
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:16,440
the arc theme which reminds me a bit of the bungee desktop and it's similar to antigross because it's

910
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:19,560
Arch base. Yes, and they're using yeah, it looks like they're using

911
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:24,120
West do you remember the name of the shell that they have here? They have power line. Yeah, okay

912
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:31,080
So they have power line installed by default, which is interesting because that's kind of a a jazzed up bash shell there and it's um

913
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,600
It makes it is it yeah, I don't know if you're watching the video version

914
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:40,120
But it makes it look a little nicer than normal and um, so if I if I go into downloads here

915
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,560
Oh, look at that. That's cute. Uh, you see that

916
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:49,240
Oh, look at that. That's cute. Uh, you see how the uh, my path is in the yeah

917
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:53,960
Yeah, isn't that it's kind of neat. It's very clean. It's very easy to read

918
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:59,240
Um, and uh, yeah, that's just something there's a lot of little things like this that they've done by by default

919
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,680
They make it a very well, I mean i'm actually making a very attractive desktop

920
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:07,480
They have like telegram right in their own repo. There's a binary so we got that. Oh, really?

921
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,520
Yeah, I don't know what else they have already. No, I guess I can just get that from the aur though

922
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:15,000
Yeah, they also have a graphical package manager that is is

923
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:19,560
Actually kind of palatable. So search telegram there. You'll see I think you'll see them both. Oh, okay

924
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,880
Okay, telegram. Let's take a look. Oh telegram with an e now. Did you know they spell with an e now?

925
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,520
I don't see it in here

926
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:31,000
No, you're a big you're a liar. Oh, okay. Well, maybe you have to you might have to enable aur and

927
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:40,040
Let's check this out. Check this out. They're using this gtk3 front end to lib alpm, which

928
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:46,920
Essentially gives you a graphical package manager for pacman and it even gives you the ability to install local alpm packages

929
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,960
Which is really kind of an interesting thing for an art user. Yeah

930
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:56,200
So this is a gtk3 interface to the package manager that they ship here. They've got caffeine just by default

931
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:01,000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I bet they have a you know, what if we launch gnome tweak, which they also have in the dock

932
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,080
Right. Yeah by default. I bet you we have quite a bit of extensions in here. Wow

933
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:12,600
Yeah, always zoom workspaces caffeine dash to dock flippery move clock media player indicator

934
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:16,280
Places status indicator. Yeah, there's a bunch in here wes

935
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,600
But you know what to be honest with you. These are actually all all of these

936
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
In fact, there's even a couple I would add

937
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,640
Um, these are all good. Um, these are actually all great

938
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:32,520
Uh, in fact, I know some of the people that make some of these and these and they're they're all really dedicated people

939
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:39,160
So these are all really high quality extensions. Um, so and then again, this is these are all these are really good defaults

940
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:45,320
Uh, it's kind of it's kind of interesting and one of the other things that they're doing that I find to be interesting

941
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,480
Is this is a patreon?

942
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:48,680
Yeah, they've got a patreon

943
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:53,160
this is a patreon fund and they've only got a few backers right now because it's early and I imagine this concept too is

944
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,560
kind of odd for a lot of people but uh,

945
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,520
I I don't know. I find it to be really neat

946
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:04,840
I I kind of i'm if I wasn't in the midst of my like 1604 mega, uh deep dive I would be

947
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,480
You know, I guess to put it another way when I go back on my arch binge

948
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:14,680
I might be tempted to go this route. The only thing i'm gonna have to spend time is I gotta look into uh,

949
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:19,800
Uh, what what always maybe you could check for me if you don't mind. Yeah, sure. Um

950
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,420
How are those gnome extensions coming from their repository?

951
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:30,120
Uh, what what all is coming from the repository because when gnome, uh 3.22 comes out

952
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:37,560
That crap's gonna break and that is always what what sort of dooms those arch-based gnome desktops in the long term

953
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:41,160
Is when they pull too much from their own private repository, but like yeah

954
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:45,560
So they have they have that fancy bash terminal installed, which is really nice. They uh,

955
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:53,720
They also have pre-built several packages like telegram in their user repository play on is installed steam is pre-installed obviously then wine

956
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,800
Because you have play on is pre-installed

957
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,560
um

958
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:02,280
It's an interesting arch-based distribution. Has anyone in the mumble room played with this one? I doubt it

959
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,800
It's pretty new apricity. I think is how you say apricity os

960
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,560
They have a cinnamon edition available as well, which neither one of us gave a shot

961
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:17,000
Okay, I mean i'm not seeing too much here's a list of everything in apricity core i've got installed. Okay, give it to me

962
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,120
Um, they've got like a bunch of themes other icons

963
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:28,040
Uh some broadcom at 10k drivers bt sync cower gnome terminal google chrome google talk plugin

964
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:32,520
That kind of stuff, uh pack aur so just kind of their own

965
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:39,160
their own modifications, uh, but it's not very much and it's none of the gnome stuff bitten mentions in the chat room real-time follow-up that that

966
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:46,600
Gdk3 gooey for the package managers that I was loving there that uh that pacman front end is what mangero uses. Oh, yeah

967
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,760
Uh, okay. Well, I I don't i'm not sensing a huge interest in this

968
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:55,240
Um, even though I actually think this is kind of a fascinating distribution. I will just wrap with this

969
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,280
Um, they're focusing on web apps

970
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:03,400
In a way that i've actually recently become a little more uh hip to myself

971
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:11,480
I've been using google chrome's uh create create it like what does google chrome call it when you go in here you can say um,

972
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:15,720
You know there's a way to isn't there a way to yeah like a way to make this a

973
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:21,320
Save uh add or save page as or add to desktop or something like that add to desktop and it makes it a desktop application

974
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:25,240
Right. Okay add to desktop makes it yeah, so that's a way to make it a desktop application

975
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:29,320
Right. Okay add to desktop makes it yeah, so they are shipping something called ice

976
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:35,320
It lets you put your favorite web app on the desktop a simple ssb a site specific browser manager

977
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:40,680
These specialized browsers are minimize the number of steps between you and wanting to use your favorite web app. They say

978
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,080
Uh, it embodies our vision here at apricity

979
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:47,640
We want to help your make your workspace and your play space more productive and elegant

980
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,520
Now as someone who has fallen into using an online markdown editor a lot

981
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:56,440
Not always an online document program google docs

982
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,440
Um an online chat program, uh irc cloud from time to time or matter most or slack

983
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:07,640
It starts to make a lot of sense to have these be separate processes that show up as separate icons in my task manager

984
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,600
See what i'm what i'm seeing is this seems like a great

985
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:15,240
It's such an easy thing to slot into you got syncing right? So bam you're syncing with yourself

986
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:18,600
You've got your key pass. You've got whatever you need now. You're signed into chrome

987
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,520
You're signed into your accounts. You make web apps for slack for telegram

988
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
And you've got your full desktop experience in like 10 minutes on a fresh install

989
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:32,200
They also say a fresh install usually idles after everything's up and running around 500 megabytes of usage

990
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:37,080
Which really isn't too bad. They focus on battery usage with tlp installed by default

991
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:44,440
Push bullet for integration with your android device to get notification notifications texts and phone calls across all your devices

992
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:48,120
Uh sync thing like west just managed also sp backup

993
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:54,680
Which is uh, kind of a nice backup program that allows you to do both compressed and uncompressed backups and split uncompressed backups

994
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,480
And like multiple parts if you want to do it across like thumb drives or something

995
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,520
uh, you can do scheduled backups and manual backups with it and

996
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:04,200
Also backups to remote destinations and they've built it in

997
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,480
Right there installed by default

998
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,880
and then like earlier mentioned the power line shell, which is the

999
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,240
pretty nice terminal prompt

1000
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:18,360
Uh, it looks really it looks really classy. They've gone throughout and made sure that the things are

1001
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,040
Well rendered under high dpi

1002
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,000
And I like their defaults, you know

1003
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,600
They're using gnome photos for your photos gnome music for your music gnome calendar for your calendar

1004
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,800
They got steam installed by default. They got a library office installed by default

1005
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:38,600
And like, you know other things like we mentioned so I it seems like a really cool project that's really thinking about this stuff

1006
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:43,000
Uh, and you know arch base which kind of gets my attention down the road, I think so apricity

1007
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
We'll have a link in the show notes apricity os.com

1008
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,400
If you guys want to check it out

1009
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,360
Derek delvin, you had to mention about chromium embedded framework. Go ahead

1010
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:59,800
I don't hear you. I guess he did have a he did have a comment. Yeah, he did. It's fine. It's fine

1011
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:05,480
Um, uh, I think these in web apps, uh inclusion into the desktop are natural

1012
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:09,100
Evolution of the chromium embedded framework. I mean google did this

1013
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:16,380
Uh simplify you development. I mean if you think atom brackets those editors are using that principle

1014
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:22,140
But I guess it's time that we before we start just jumping on board and this start making the question

1015
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:28,220
Aren't our browsers already doing quite a lot and do we really want to be in this completely remote?

1016
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:34,220
So the application can run somewhere else and you just get that face. No, no, no, no, but in some cases, yes

1017
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:39,740
Yes, yeah in some cases, especially for stuff. I don't care a lot about the south is not super important

1018
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,540
Yeah, I think so, right? Yeah

1019
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:47,980
Um, but yeah, that's a good question patreon.com slash apricity. They have four patrons right now. They're making 30 bucks a month

1020
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,540
I doubt that's covering much

1021
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:56,220
Yeah, I doubt I doubt so but that's a it's an interesting try and so, uh, i'm glad you installed a west

1022
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:58,300
Yeah, we'll see. I might just be using it next week as well

1023
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:04,460
I'm not seeing I mean I can mount my other one if I need it. I'm not seeing a lot of reason to go back

1024
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:09,660
Do you uh like the performance on the physical hardware performance is okay on the spot there? Yeah, absolutely

1025
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:15,020
I mean I it's I suspended it all the way here. Things are working great. Yeah. Yeah, you know wes

1026
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:19,020
I think we should take a moment and we should thank linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

1027
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:22,540
Now all of us know that if you really want to get a great job

1028
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:25,180
You're probably going to have to have a few certifications under your belt

1029
01:18:25,180 --> 01:18:29,100
Also, it's kind of nice as personal challenges and it's also helps at review time

1030
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,460
Linux academy has had a ton of success in the last few months

1031
01:18:32,860 --> 01:18:34,860
Uh, I I mean they have had success for

1032
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:39,840
A lot longer than that, but they've been publishing it on their blogs in the last few months and really sort of demonstrating

1033
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,060
What a difference people can see when they go to linux academy

1034
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:50,620
Especially when they're looking to learn something around linux or aws other learning sites. They don't quite get it right

1035
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:57,980
They don't quite have the passion and the drive to actually care enough to understand the difference between red hat enterprise linux and fedora

1036
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:02,060
Or debian and ubuntu there are differences, you know

1037
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:06,380
There are but they can barely even understand what they are. That's not linux academy

1038
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:12,620
Linux academy is a platform designed by people that are extremely passionate about linux and wanted to sort of promote it

1039
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:15,340
In a way that would get wider adoption for linux

1040
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:20,220
They came together with educators and professionals and developers and created the linux academy platform

1041
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:25,340
Linux academy.com slash unplugged go there support this show and give yourself a discount

1042
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:27,980
you know

1043
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:32,140
I think also one of the things you might take for granted about linux academy because it

1044
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,900
It's a website. You probably think it's only useful when you have an internet connection

1045
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:39,340
But if you're going to be offline like i'm about to be for several days

1046
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:44,540
Uh, they have downloadable comprehensive study guides. They have pdfs for reading wow

1047
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:49,340
They have audio and video stuff that you can get while you're offline as well

1048
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:51,340
Uh listener seth

1049
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,500
Listens in the shower

1050
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:58,540
He's not bringing his laptop in there. He's got a plane through his speaker system while he's in the shower. That's awesome

1051
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:03,420
Yeah, I know it is kind of awesome. Uh, and that's a really nice functionality of linux. They also have of course

1052
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:04,300
Yeah, okay

1053
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:09,340
So they so on the other end they also have live events and you can ask instructors questions and they have instructor mentoring and

1054
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:16,220
All of that and they have an active forums. It's packed full of jupiter broadcasting members. They have great courseware on red hat. I mean

1055
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:20,300
I mean noah is all about the red hat enterprise certified like

1056
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:25,660
Administrator and engineer and he's always yeah. Well and the clients love it man

1057
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:28,220
That's I mean, I don't know how much noah is into it

1058
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:32,780
I mean, I think he respects red hat as a company, but it's the clients that really want it

1059
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,940
And it's the same when you're trying to get a job

1060
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:37,020
Uh, and so that's why he pursues it and you know

1061
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:42,620
He's done a lot of different avenues and red hat is totally is a seriously respected certification

1062
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:47,820
And their courseware at linux academy is top notch also on the aws stuff on the front of aws

1063
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:51,980
just when I started getting into like s3 and storing my uh,

1064
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:58,140
Web assets and like the complicated system that they have for it and it's like, okay i've got this

1065
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:01,980
I don't need any courseware on this right? I mastered this on my own

1066
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:06,700
Okay, so then I went further and a client needed a windows 2003 server

1067
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:13,820
And well, you know what i'm an aws expert now i'll go set this up for you. Yeah, I had um

1068
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:16,620
I had like a couple of weeks of like, you know

1069
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:20,940
Going back and forth with the client and citing how we were going to do what and what was going to run

1070
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:26,380
Where and all me all all in the meanwhile this brand new server I set up for them was running on aws

1071
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:28,540
and uh

1072
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:34,620
I didn't I didn't quite grok the fact that that was like like costing me like this as the cpu runs

1073
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,620
it costs me money like

1074
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:43,280
Per cycle it costs money like unbelievable right unbelievable. They're charging me per cpu cycle unbelievable

1075
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:45,980
Who even tracks that is what I was thinking?

1076
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:51,260
So I got this bill and i'm like, uh, yeah, you know that server that we haven't even deployed to production yet

1077
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:56,060
We're already paying for it. Sorry, and I was using that time to learn the system too

1078
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:58,700
Kind of you know at the same time

1079
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,900
That's a podcaster folks. Yeah

1080
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,900
Yeah

1081
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:09,820
Linux academy.com slash unplugged when you go there and you're going through one of their courses or they have a scenario

1082
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:14,620
Or a live lab they'll spin up the aws instance for you and manage all of that

1083
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,700
So you don't get stuck with that fine

1084
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:23,580
Uh, they also have android development courses php python ruby the whole dev ops category chef is their chef tutorials are very helpful

1085
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:30,620
Dude, they're linux basics and all of that and they have like nuggets on ip tables and net tables and fire and tables

1086
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:36,380
whatever it's called now and filter all the things all the things ssh all the things really they have great nuggets, too

1087
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:38,860
If you just have a little bit of time and you want to just do a deep dive

1088
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:46,220
So go check them out linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and avoid that huge bill that uh that I got I got one day

1089
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:52,060
Okay, so there was a thread over on our linux that kind of got me wondering, uh, it said is you know

1090
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,380
What's the state of vr?

1091
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:57,260
Uh for the for the linux desktop, uh, what do we have?

1092
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:01,980
I3 on multiple monitors those kind of things and there was a couple of different answers that came out of the thread

1093
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,780
But one of them west was kind of intriguing

1094
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:10,560
It was a qt5 or qt5 based 3d wayland compositor

1095
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,940
Oh snap. Yeah

1096
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:19,100
So what this now this is totally early days, but what they have designed is sort of a wolfenstein style

1097
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:23,020
layout of a of a map and in

1098
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:29,280
In each room is a different virtual desktop. So when you go between rooms you're going between virtual desktops

1099
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:34,940
And you have like different windows and then you can you know, you would have perhaps like a bot in there west

1100
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:39,260
You know about bots wait and you heard about bots. Yeah. Well, you could have a bot in there and things like that

1101
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:43,180
So that's that's one representation of it

1102
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:47,020
But there's there hasn't there's not a lot of progress

1103
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:50,780
There's not a lot of progress for the linux desktop. Um,

1104
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:57,580
Uh hololens sdk hackaday.io has a great one that they posted back in 2015

1105
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:01,580
Where they had like a couple of different a couple of different examples

1106
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:05,600
That were that looked pretty exciting you put the headset on and now you're doing window management

1107
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:12,460
And again another room concept i've seen a bunch of different concepts ibx is one that runs on windows and linux

1108
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,100
but maybe i'm just

1109
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:22,780
Maybe i'm just smoking the hype too much wimpy. Do you think there will never be a real use case for vr on linux?

1110
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:26,700
I'm a skeptic

1111
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:35,500
Um, yeah, but i'm not much of a gamer either but I I don't know wearing a great big heavy thing on your head

1112
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:40,220
People weren't prepared to wear glasses to watch 3d films

1113
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:44,380
But what about what about just the fact that it would be the world's largest monitor?

1114
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:50,060
Okay, think about that think about you know, 27 inch monitor 30. No the entire room is your screen

1115
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:57,580
But strapped to your head and also until they're completely wireless, you know, you're just tethered. You're just you know, like a pony, you know

1116
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,220
A pony

1117
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:10,060
Okay, okay, okay. All right, mr. Skeptic, but okay. Okay, you're probably right actually i'm fairly skeptical myself

1118
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:15,340
I really i'm only playing devil's advocate. But what about something like a mumble room ask poppy?

1119
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:21,260
He's got a cancer argument. I'm sure poppy. Do you think we could have a vr desktop on linux in the future?

1120
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,780
Uh, what come on poppy, maybe you could maybe you could slap

1121
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:30,540
Your ubuntu phone into a google cardboard headset and now you are in vr

1122
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,100
unity

1123
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:38,220
And you know they built in support for mirror too they've built support in the mirror for vr in the future

1124
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:42,380
Oh poppy doesn't answer now. I guess he doesn't have an opinion. Sorry

1125
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:42,940
Go ahead

1126
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:47,020
I just left the room to make a cup of tea for my wife and all I heard when I got back to the microphone

1127
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:51,820
Was poppy isn't answering so poppy that is you are such a romantic. You are a gentleman

1128
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:57,180
Uh, the question was is you know wimpy is sort of an on the record vr

1129
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:59,660
Um skeptic you could say

1130
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:05,980
And i'm somewhere in the middle. I'm sort of a vr hopeful but 10 trending skeptic

1131
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:11,660
What do you think? Uh, we're just talking about sort of the lack of a vr desktop, but there are a couple different projects

1132
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:18,700
They're mostly school projects that create a virtual linux desktop in vr. What about poppy? I'm just going to throw this out in your face

1133
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:21,260
ubuntu touch

1134
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,340
in a google cardboard headset

1135
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:27,260
ubuntu vr unity desktop your thoughts

1136
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:31,580
Can we get our existing desktop working first

1137
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:35,180
Ha ha ha great answer. That's a good answer. Well, okay

1138
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:37,900
We're gonna go 10 20 years and no we're gonna go five years in the future

1139
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:41,740
Do you think there could be a vr desktop? I really feel like linux is missing out on vr

1140
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:44,380
But maybe i'm just sort of getting excited by

1141
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:49,900
I don't know the tweets of some people that are working on vr. I mean i'm just getting hyped

1142
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:57,820
I don't know. I see this as being a bit like the the tesla. It's something, you know quite desirable and

1143
01:26:57,820 --> 01:27:03,020
And it might be useful for a small set of people on the planet, but for the vast majority of people

1144
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:08,860
They will almost never see this and therefore it won't be useful for them. Therefore. We shouldn't devote

1145
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:11,820
99 of our developers sure sure that's it

1146
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:12,220
Okay

1147
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:16,380
And it seems like it'll start where a lot of things start where like first entertainment and then in like particular

1148
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:22,060
Power applications like cad modeling or you know, whatever where they really take advantage very

1149
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:24,940
Very specific 3d use cases for it

1150
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:28,940
But then like if i'm looking at a document I can't

1151
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:32,780
You know call me an old fart or lack of imagination

1152
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:38,220
But I can't see how a libre office document can be improved by the adding of an extra dimension

1153
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:43,340
I agree with you there. I've already got that a plane in a third dimension if I just look at my life

1154
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:47,500
But I but you I could I could agree with you there, but there could be use cases

1155
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:50,780
I mean, I think of it as just more screen real estate to be honest with you

1156
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:56,140
And you're right and yeah being able to look behind things and look around things is is novel

1157
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:59,580
And we've seen demos of this for years and years that guy who strapped a couple of

1158
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:03,580
Wee motes to his head and did a nice demo of you know

1159
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:08,620
being able to move your head from side to side and look around things and get a real parallax kind of view of

1160
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:11,980
Of things on your desktop. It looked interesting, but that was years and years ago

1161
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:15,600
And nobody ever did anything with it partly because it's kind of impractical

1162
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,560
Would be coolest thing. Oh, sorry. Go ahead dear devin

1163
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:27,440
So I think the use case for documents is when we have the natural voice commands working

1164
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:33,600
So you're not necessarily writing the document. So a libre office the application definitely is not an application to benefit from it

1165
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,920
But let's say you are searching your computer and you're seeing the results

1166
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:41,920
In a graph window and then you're seeing the other graph available to you

1167
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:48,240
And whatever else and maybe you are actually projecting this to what is your reality?

1168
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:52,560
So it's a more of an augmented reality than just virtual reality

1169
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,280
And now at that point that you're talking with your computer and you're getting the results and they're coming to you

1170
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,760
I guess now you can have different ways of manipulating these data

1171
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:06,880
Rather than think of the normal conventional applications with that we are talking about

1172
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,400
I think the benefits will be in there. Hmm. So

1173
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:16,320
So, you know you're looking at stock or you're looking at the company or you're doing your search and suddenly you are

1174
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:21,140
With the data that you wanted for stocks for example for that application

1175
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,200
And then you can do the math next to it and you can get the result, right?

1176
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,160
producer q5 sister says that he thinks that

1177
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:33,360
Perhaps there could be an interesting use case in terms of interface for managing vms

1178
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,880
Running a vm on a virtual computer in your vr world. So it's like you're really sitting at that virtual machine. Yeah

1179
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,080
Huh?

1180
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,600
Uh, well, it's a cinema killer as well. Yeah, it could be I agree

1181
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:47,280
Now when I tried it on the the most low-end implementation of vr

1182
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:52,160
I've tried is on the samsung galaxy vr and to me it just seemed like a glorified way to watch great movies

1183
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,400
Yeah, but it was a great way to watch movies

1184
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,640
Janus vr jn

1185
01:29:56,640 --> 01:30:00,800
Us vr is something that already works on linux today

1186
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:07,040
Uh, and it's what they say it combines the power of the internet with the potential of virtual reality

1187
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:10,420
Websites become immersive spaces linked by portals

1188
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:15,700
Where users can explore collaborate and create content on a platform that builds upon the open internet?

1189
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:18,900
Um, and it's so retro in so many ways

1190
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:23,140
It's like how we actually would have visualized the internet to work in the 80s when we did movies

1191
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:30,340
Yeah, right, uh where you go through portals to go to different rooms and there's avatars and people have keys and it is

1192
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:35,700
It is so neat in its in its in its intricacy

1193
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:39,080
But it is so impractical in its actual usability

1194
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:44,440
That I find it to be a fascinating experiment and it's using browser technology

1195
01:30:45,860 --> 01:30:49,860
Now the hardware thing was you and I noticed when we were looking around it's like

1196
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:54,660
It looks like nobody is taking the plunge on the linux side and just like

1197
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:59,220
Trying to see what works under linux. Yeah. Now the vive is just starting to ship but

1198
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:03,300
Everybody online right now is asking does the hdc vive work?

1199
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:07,620
That's this that's the that's the official steam backed steam vr headset

1200
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:12,660
Does it work with linux and everybody's asking the question, but nobody's really got an answer right now. Yep

1201
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:17,460
Uh, and you got google cardboard, but that doesn't really work with linux desktop and oculus, you know

1202
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:19,460
They could go suck an egg for all I care

1203
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:25,780
Oculus, yeah, go ahead and there is a big reason for why in linux there hasn't been much development

1204
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:31,460
We have usually huge issues with graphics drivers. So yeah, that's fixed

1205
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:36,260
You really can't do anything right, you know, all I want all I want is just the game

1206
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:38,020
I just want there to be a standard

1207
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:40,420
I just want to I want there to be a vr standard

1208
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:46,340
And games just need to support that standard and then if I have the hardware that that understands that standard plugged into my

1209
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,660
Into my machine that's all it needs to be

1210
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:53,700
I just want to get to that level and that's when it's going to be that's when it's really going to be something

1211
01:31:54,100 --> 01:31:57,700
Um, yeah, yeah, you know, I have a little bitterness with the oculus

1212
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:59,300
It's true the way they draw, you know

1213
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:02,900
I backed it because they had linux support. Yeah, and then when they dropped it

1214
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:06,900
You know and I uh

1215
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:12,580
I the reason why i'm not a full-on skeptic like wimpy is and I I was until I got the oculus

1216
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:16,260
uh dk2 and when I got the dk2 and um

1217
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:18,820
I know i've shared this story

1218
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:23,060
But when I got the dk2 and I went on this little raft that's floating out on the ocean

1219
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:26,980
And I just I just I sat there for I had a chair here in the studio

1220
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:30,100
So it was like I was sitting on the raft and I had the oculus here in the studio

1221
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:35,860
So and the studio is um is is sound insulated and I had headphones on

1222
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:42,260
So it was like there was no and it's dark in here. There's there's no outside influence. It was

1223
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:44,980
It was it was very much

1224
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,700
perceptually like I was um

1225
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:51,780
Like I was on this raft and because I was on a swiveling chair

1226
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:58,020
I could turn my whole body to to turn with with the vr environment and so it was like I was

1227
01:32:58,260 --> 01:33:00,260
Turning around and looking at the ocean

1228
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:04,180
And I I kind of got like that feeling you get when you're just chilling on the beach

1229
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:10,100
And when I started to feel like I was chilling on the beach when i'm sitting in my studio in my chair

1230
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:14,900
I realized there's something here. I don't know exactly what it is

1231
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:18,580
But there that just gave me a totally new experience

1232
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:23,220
Yeah, and that was really something and so that's why i'm hopeful we figure it out

1233
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:26,180
But right now the hardware requirements are ridiculous. Yeah

1234
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:29,220
And the linux support is weak

1235
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:35,460
And the most economical implementation is going to be the cheap stuff built into the phones

1236
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:40,040
Which have the weakest graphics and the most disappointing applications?

1237
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:46,020
So yeah, uh wimpy asks, uh, you were asking how much the oculus is

1238
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:50,900
Uh-huh. I think it was about 300 bucks, but I can't I can't it might be it might have been what was that?

1239
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:52,500
You know, it was one of those

1240
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:58,760
Like second round fundings, so I don't recall how how many times have you been out on the raft virtually?

1241
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:04,900
Only a few because i've been i've lent it out. I've lent out the oculus since then when they dropped their linux support

1242
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:12,340
And i'm just thinking you could probably have rented a boat and experienced, you know bobbing up and down on the ocean for real

1243
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:17,220
For about the same money fair enough and there you get smell. Yeah, that's true

1244
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:25,220
Well, this reality needs to offer something other than a poor simulation of reality to be compelling. I think you're probably right

1245
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:26,740
You're probably right

1246
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:29,300
Um kitson you had a thought though. Go ahead

1247
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:37,860
Uh, yeah, uh one more serious thought on this is I just think the vm would is just overkill for most gaming

1248
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,540
Applications and just computer applications, especially in general

1249
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:46,900
Uh, most of the best games that i've played had really simple graphics

1250
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:50,420
And they were able to place me in a world where I was more

1251
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:57,860
Convinced of things true than a lot of these games that try to force graphics and cinematics on you and it's just

1252
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:01,460
Yeah, yeah, that's true. You are talking to the guy that just got mario

1253
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:04,020
Working again on his uh television at home

1254
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:08,900
A funny side effect of that is that because of the power required for vr

1255
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:12,900
The current vr games are less graphically intensive just like you described

1256
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:17,700
Yeah, that's why it feels like it's going to be a real catch-22 for them to ever actually take off

1257
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:19,940
I will say that eve valkyrie

1258
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:26,900
Demo did seem pretty neat. Well, what's that one the eval create? Is that an e3 in 2015? Oh, yeah

1259
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:29,300
Yeah, yeah, that's an older one, right? Yeah. Yeah

1260
01:35:30,020 --> 01:35:32,020
Yeah, that just always stuck with me

1261
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:36,660
There's not a lot standing between linux and having broader vr support because a lot of the engines

1262
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:40,980
That that like like the unreal engine for example, you know, if you make a vr game

1263
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:45,300
Okay, here's what here's what it is. This is i'm just gonna i've just got to be

1264
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:47,780
This is going to be linux unplugged confession edition

1265
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:50,580
Uh, I want to walk around the starship enterprise

1266
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:52,580
and

1267
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:56,820
and there is an oculus vr compatible starship enterprise project that is

1268
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:03,060
Unbelievably detailed and the man has recreated areas of the enterprise that you've never seen that in order to connect it all together

1269
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:08,180
So you can walk the entire thing. I included like areas of the shuttle bay that are absolutely stunning and compelling

1270
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:11,060
I mean it is wow, it is transcending

1271
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:15,460
and now you've just described something that actually makes it

1272
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,480
compelling because

1273
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:21,220
You can't experience that in the real world

1274
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:28,900
So he took the blueprints to the starship enterprise and made them into a virtual world

1275
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:31,780
Yeah, it is here. I'll show if you're watching the video version. I'll show you a little bit

1276
01:36:31,780 --> 01:36:36,820
It's pre-alpha footage here. Um, and he's been working on it for a long time. He has a patreon for it. Uh, but uh,

1277
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:43,460
What he did is he took the blueprints to make the most accurate representations if he could from like it's about season six or seven

1278
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:45,380
From what I can tell by watching it

1279
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:49,140
And I am that much of a nerd that I can tell it's about season five six or seven

1280
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:54,500
But I would guess six and it is uh, it is remarkably accurate. It starts with a

1281
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:59,700
It starts with a tour of the shuttle bay in a way. It shows you how the uh, how um,

1282
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:05,860
The cargo bays and the shuttle bays are connected in a way that is brilliant, but yet never demonstrated in the actual show

1283
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:10,900
Um, and he goes and he goes on to show you areas that you are very familiar with

1284
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:14,260
Oh, here's another he spends a lot of time on the shuttle because he's very proud of it

1285
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:16,660
The lot and this is all based on the unreal engine

1286
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:19,460
So it looks

1287
01:37:19,460 --> 01:37:24,420
Really good and it's all oculus compatible. So this is a 10 forward lounge

1288
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:27,060
That he's showing here and i'll go forward because you know

1289
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:31,140
What we all want to see though is we what we really want to see is the meeting room here and things like that

1290
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:33,220
so this probably gets pulled down from youtube, but

1291
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:35,780
Of course, it does also have sounds

1292
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,300
Oh, man

1293
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:43,540
What's that? He's in the conference room and this is why I say it's like season four five six seven on it

1294
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:45,540
It's it's later on in tng

1295
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:50,740
And then he had to make up this hallway and he took the old conference room gold chips from the conference room and put them

1296
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:53,700
In the hallway connecting to the bridge, which is just brilliant because they

1297
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:58,420
Those were destroyed because they used the set in star trek 6 now he's on the bridge

1298
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:03,720
And it's it is immaculately done

1299
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:09,300
Now you would

1300
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:16,660
So I I would I would pretty much I would die to have this under linux right

1301
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:20,660
The detail

1302
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:22,820
Photon torpedoes armed

1303
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:28,660
And targeted and he walks around, you know the whole thing he's got he's got just about every even oh, he even did the bathroom

1304
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:33,540
Look, he even finally did the bathroom. Now. This is based on schematics. There's three shells, which is a

1305
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:36,180
Yeah, a nod to a stalone movie

1306
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:38,980
And uh, he's got three shells in the bathroom, which is just hilarious

1307
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:42,100
You can sit in the captain's chair

1308
01:38:42,100 --> 01:38:43,700
protects fools

1309
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:46,020
little children and ships named enterprise

1310
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:49,220
I don't think i'm cut out to be captain

1311
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:52,100
First officer, maybe

1312
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:55,380
And go check out the ready room

1313
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:03,140
It really is remarkable it's so well done and so uh, there's also there's other air there are

1314
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:09,460
One of the things that the gear vr was really good at was photographic tours of paris

1315
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:11,620
Which I thought was i've never been to paris

1316
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:15,220
Uh, so I took a photo tour of paris and it's not like google street view

1317
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:20,020
It's way cooler than google street view. And of course you can do 360 degree

1318
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:23,140
You can look around uh that tearing is not in the video by the way

1319
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:25,380
That's just on my i'm having some problems with kaywin today

1320
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:30,840
Um, but the tearing isn't there and the the engine is is is just you can see the graphics are

1321
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:36,840
So

1322
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:44,520
Yeah that I can't wait I don't know I don't know what vr solution is going to provide me this but uh,

1323
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:48,200
I'll pay for it. That's for sure

1324
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:59,800
Yeah, I love it I love it so that's what I I want that but I don't want to have to run windows

1325
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:03,240
You know, like that's a real conflict for me. I want that in my life

1326
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,560
But at the same time I don't want to have to run windows

1327
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:07,960
And so we got to get this figured out under linux

1328
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:12,840
So if anybody out there has tried or it gets their hands on the htc vive. You've got to let us know

1329
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:19,640
Uh, yeah. Yeah, he's uh, you gotta let us know how it goes x metal x metal just comments youtube is going to hate this

1330
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:21,000
Yeah

1331
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,080
Yeah, i've already got one of my shows pulled down this week. So why not have another show pulled down?

1332
01:40:25,240 --> 01:40:26,280
It's only tuesday

1333
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:30,440
So might as well get two shows pulled down one a week one day one show a week. Why not everybody?

1334
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:34,360
So yeah, I agree with you wimpy if you make it compelling enough I could get interested

1335
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:40,360
I think I also agree with the rest of you. I'm not looking to do a vr desktop anytime soon. I'd give it a go

1336
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,480
but

1337
01:40:43,640 --> 01:40:45,720
Just for a desktop it'd be too much hassle. Yeah

1338
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:51,320
Yeah, let's let's just get the main desktops working. Let's get wayland out there. Let's get mirror working

1339
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:56,680
Let's get unity finished up then we could worry about the virtual reality and you know and the whatnots, right? Don't you think?

1340
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:58,600
All right

1341
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:02,120
Yeah, I might reconsider if I get to use the nintendo power glove

1342
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:06,440
Bring that all in bring it all together. Why not? Let's do it

1343
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:11,720
That seems like that actually seems like a pretty good idea. I think you should you should capitalize on that

That was a lot of fun, thank you everybody for joining us

1357
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:51,900
We had we had a lot of all come together and I think it made for a nice medley of the unplugged program

1358
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:54,540
I think so. Thank you very much. What was that?

1359
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:57,980
do that the plasma kill shortcut that uh

1360
01:42:57,980 --> 01:43:03,580
Oh, yeah, what was that plasma kill shortcut? I that might do it does that but that probably doesn't restart kwin. Does it?

1361
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:05,660
I don't know

1362
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:09,580
What was that plasma kill shortcut? It wasn't on this computer. So I don't have it in my recent history

1363
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:14,540
Oh, that was nice. Wow. Look at that. It's so bad. Look at my look at krunner. Oh, that's

1364
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:17,900
Unusable that is not even that is like yikes

1365
01:43:18,620 --> 01:43:20,620
Holy smokes. Look at that

1366
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:23,580
That is getting in the seizure territory, right? Yeah

1367
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:29,100
Rekai records this for a bug report. I gotta tell you we saw that on open qa once it's flashing as fuck. Yeah

1368
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:37,500
I wasn't an x and mess and stuff. Are you running? Uh, I you know, I uh

1369
01:43:38,140 --> 01:43:40,540
I have no idea be whatever the default I could go bring up

1370
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:45,100
You know one thing I do and I did play with is like the kwin rendering settings, but I don't even know it

1371
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:47,180
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh

1372
01:43:47,660 --> 01:43:48,700
Whoa

1373
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:53,100
Whoa. Oh my gosh. All my icons just did like this little blurry thing for a second

1374
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:57,980
A little like holy smokes. This is getting crazy. I wonder if it's gonna make it the show now

1375
01:43:57,980 --> 01:43:59,980
we're gonna now it's gonna be like a race against the uh,

1376
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:05,740
So where do you go? Okay, so I can I still can never figure out kd settings. There's so many freaking

1377
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:14,140
So where do I guess i'm reloading this machine, uh, where do I go to find where you configure is it not

1378
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:16,700
God, there's so many options in here

1379
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:20,300
That's not the bonobo by the way. No, this is on the apollo

1380
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:22,300
Uh

1381
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:28,940
Where do you go to manage kwin now, where the hell is that at?

1382
01:44:31,180 --> 01:44:34,060
Maybe if I just up there and search type in window manager, I know but

1383
01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:36,780
That is such a cop out window

1384
01:44:37,980 --> 01:44:39,980
Just start management

1385
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:45,100
None of that's coming up. I know how about just like what if I just type for kwin will that work kwin?

1386
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:48,460
Here we go. Wow. Oh there. Can you see my icons? Do you see that? Look at that?

1387
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:52,380
We'll look at the window management icon. Do you see what i'm talking about? Come on there. It's back now

1388
01:44:52,940 --> 01:45:00,780
Yeah, it's listed under one of those categories, but it doesn't say kwin explicitly. All right. Okay, so let's see here. Uh,

1389
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:06,140
Kwin rules kwin scripts task switcher. Nope. No, none of this is what I want

1390
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:09,740
I'm looking for the thing where you change what your renderer is in kwin

1391
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:12,380
desktop behavior

1392
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:15,660
This is this is this is the problem really

1393
01:45:15,660 --> 01:45:19,740
This is really the thing. Okay compositor. Here we go. Open gl is what I currently have

1394
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:23,740
I'm going to try 3 1 and see what happens. I mean what what could go worse than what's happening now?

1395
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:26,300
Nothing, it stopped

1396
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:28,300
It stopped

1397
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:31,260
You see that

1398
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:33,260
Let's see if I can aggravate it

1399
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:35,260
It's not doing it with boxes

1400
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:38,540
It's not doing it with spotify

1401
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:42,940
I think switching kwin from wait a minute. Nope. It's doing it again. Damn it

1402
01:45:42,940 --> 01:45:49,260
Oh, it's happening again. Although it's not look it's not happening on the second screen yet. That's interesting

1403
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:51,420
Oh now it is now it's happening on the second screen

1404
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:58,060
Well that lasted a good few seconds. That's too bad. Got your hopes up though. I did I did. What if I do x render?

1405
01:46:00,780 --> 01:46:02,860
Okay, it stopped I did x render it stopped

1406
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:06,540
I don't know if I go aggravate it a little bit

1407
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:09,660
This is this is definitely a kwin issue though

1408
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:13,660
There's no way about that there's no this this is definitely so now i'm not using open gl as my render

1409
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:16,540
I'm using x render which I would imagine means it's cpu-based, right?

1410
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:19,820
Seems to be working really good though

1411
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:25,840
All right, now i'm not having a problem. Awesome. So i'll go with x render for the show. Yay

1412
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:38,880
Perfect. Yeah, perfect. My definition of perfect exactly
