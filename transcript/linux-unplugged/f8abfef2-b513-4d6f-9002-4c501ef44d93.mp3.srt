00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 3 for August 26, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hi everyone, welcome to Linux Unplugged. It is a ship that sails proudly without its rudder.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We have lots of opinions, lots of emails, but no scripts, no plan of action.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Just a couple of guys sitting around talking about Linux, hanging out with our community,

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and really debating the important things in life, like, you know, Linux.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My name is Chris.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
My name is Matt.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hey Matt.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hey.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I was going to ask you something before we got into all the Linux stuff.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh yeah.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now, where do you fall on the Star Trek fandom scale?

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Like, are you a pretty big Star Trek guy, or do you kind of, like, you know, you know about the cultural references but not much further than that?

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not, like, hard hardcore, but I would say that I'm definitely well-versed and I'm a big fan.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I mean, let me put it this way.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What was the last series you actively watched?

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, I tolerate Voyager.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh my gosh.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay, that was my next question.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And see, that tells you by using the word tolerate that I'm a fan.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I know exactly where you're at.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm dialed in now.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So you did – did you watch it while it was on the air, or have you gone back and, like, Netflixed it?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I went back – I actually got more out of it Netflixing the entire series going back to, you know, pre-Kirk Pike and all the way up.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh wow.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So that – I mean, you've got to do it right.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I have a dream of a podcast, and there's already a podcast out there doing it.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I mentioned it actually in the Unplugged.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's why I'm not – that's why I just let it go.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But I love the idea of doing a podcast that just reviews every single Star Trek episode from the beginning.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And it's interesting you say that because I started and I've been rewatching the original series, like, you know, one episode a week.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll find a time where I'm working late, and I'll just put it on, and it's a great companion show.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And so I started picking up on Voyager again.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And, you know, when you can back-to-back Voyager, it's kind of like Lost.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Like, I did not like Lost when I had to wait a week in between big reveals.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Exactly.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But when I can just, like, pop on the next one, I'm like, oh, that's not so bad.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's like the stakes aren't so high.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I think you nailed it.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think you nailed it because for me, the first season of Voyager was just painful.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Then once the characters really came into their own, you know, and especially Neelix.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That was kind of my Jar Jar Binks character.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I was really having a hard time with that.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, after a while, I really came to, you know, I really kind of grew onto the whole Talaxian mindset.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, you did.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You actually, you know, I was kind of like, you know, he's weird, but he's got wisdom going on.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well, after Kes leaves the ship, his anxiety is kind of dialed down.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He's not quite as obnoxious.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That was what needed to happen.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Kes was a great character, but she was a little not appropriate for that particular series, I don't think.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Right, right.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, I love the chat room.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They've locked in on the, I said we discussed the important things in life like Linux.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And so, of course, they've immediately started debating which distro is the best.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Now, of course, the big part of Linux Unplugged is the fact that we are live.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And so to sort of jar everybody, now that we've got a mumble server set up, now that we've got live people showing up,

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
the best course of action would be to change the day we're doing the show on.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That is the best thing to do at that point.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Now you've got everything nice and locked in.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Always.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yep, yep.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So we're going to move the Linux Unplugged live recording to Tuesdays at 2 p.m.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So same bat time, same bat channel, just a different bat day.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And it'll be tomorrow, only next week, because we're not doing two shows this week.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So next Tuesday we'll be live at 2 p.m.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Plan B is on break until the end of September-ish.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So I'm using that slot and that kind of gives me some more free time to take care of some business in the Monday afternoon time.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Good stuff.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Good times.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm all about the business.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So quick update, we do now have a working mumble server.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The issue was the mumble server was working last week, but I had grabbed the Git version of mumble from the Arch user repo.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, that'll get you.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, the server was like, nope, too new of a version.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So, you know, Pacman makes it crazy easy to downgrade.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You just essentially give it the other package name, the non-Git version.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It says, oh, well, I'm going to need to remove the Git version first.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And I say, yes, yes, you may remove the Git version.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And it just pulls off the Git version and pulls down the regular version.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And I was up in business.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So now we've got a working mumble room.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We've got people in the lobby and we've got a spot.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
People can jump in and chat with us if they want.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If they want to interrupt the show.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No, I'm kidding.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We hope they do interrupt as we go.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sure there is going to be just fine.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And I'm glad we got the mumble server working.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That is awesome.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So folks can join us live and then they can actually get in the show.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And it's kind of like calling in only using all open source software.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And another big thing we're doing and I don't know if I mentioned this in the show is.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So the good side is that more of Linux Unplug is essentially everything right now.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Except for the actual part that's streaming out to the internet is running on Linux.

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So we're doing the whole show on Linux.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
All the audio is being produced on Linux.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm cutting and shipping the video on a Mac.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But that's just kind of like it's almost just like it's like a little quick little quick quick.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's a little workhorse thing.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yeah.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's because it's not really editing involved.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So but the rest is all being done on the GNU slash Linux.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You guys might be familiar with this.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It was an operating system created about 21 22 years ago by Richard King Stallman.

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you familiar with Richard King Stallman.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I am familiar with Mr. Stallman.

112
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He created the BSD kernel that GNU slash Linux runs on.

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And I can push this until the chat room loses it.

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh yeah.

116
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
So we'd love to have you join us that way.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You can talk about this.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But all right.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I want I have a couple of things from last week's episode.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I just thought maybe I'd just chat about with you.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
See what you thought.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So you remember you remember yesterday right before the show started.

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I went out to the garage and I logged into my machine and my KDE session just totally dumped on me.

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It went poo poo.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It was not a pleasant thing.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And then for people watching and listening to the released version of the Linux action show.

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
All they get is Matt and Chris griping about Katie.

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But they never know like why we were upset.

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Right.

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Like we were making offhanded comments about Katie being crap.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And we didn't actually like because if you were watching live you didn't you didn't know that part.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Well the live chat room specific you know blackout 24 was awesome and other folks to pointed me in the direction of a different couple options to resolve the problem during the show.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I just backed up my doc Katie for directory and started a new and logged in with a totally reset Katie setup.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Which is certainly a definite fix.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I mean it got me off right.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yeah I was able to do that between show segments and that was something.

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So then through through through the links in the in the Linux action show subreddit.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I got a dug through the arch form and kind of zeroed in on where the particular problem is.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So first the last action I took before I had any problems with Katie and Katie not log in as I updated Python dash sip Python dash pi y cutie for Python to dash sip and Python to py cutie for.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So a couple of Python cutie things were updated.

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Then I rebooted like a day later after running you know for a while and logged in and boom.

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I was like oh yeah I forgot I even did an update.

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And of course the air that would kick back at me was executable air plasma desktop signal segmentation fault.

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No without no no no further information.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The desktop would flash a few times and I'd just be so well.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But you know I got people in terms of I move that dot Katie for folder so I did that.

147
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And then I debated I looks like if I would specifically remove the dot Katie for slash share slash config slash plasma folder like I didn't have to remove the whole Katie folder I could have got just that plasma.

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah I could have gone three levels deep remove just that and I would have not had nearly as much stuff reset to default and gotten to my desktop and then being able to kind of recover because of whatever was causing that would have been resolved.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's Katie for dot one one the latest.

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's a good experience in that you were able to learn from it and say oh OK well now I know that if it works later.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't totally understand what caused it but I I do know like I see now how to fix it.

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And you know that Katie for directories structure is actually pretty straightforward.

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And also bear in mind folks when this is your production machine it's kind of a big problem when that happens mid stream mid show mid you know you're getting ready to do something whatever it may be.

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's definitely kind of an anxiety thing you know.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yeah you know it was a little like oh man now great that you know I could just log in to know.

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And a lot of folks in the in the chat room and some folks in the subreddit were saying oh it's video card driver got to be video card driver.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I don't know if it was right because I didn't upgrade the video card driver there and I thought I was saying on the live stream that I just upgraded my kernel but I had actually was not true.

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I had not it was an upgrade that was pending but I had not actually gone through with the upgrade yet.

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So I don't think it was graphics drivers related and because no shell worked and strike suit zero was working just fine.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't think it was that I don't think it was.

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And as I think the key you know kind of a troubleshooting one on one point thing you pointed out is that I did not change the graphics driver.

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So you know erring on the side of obvious here you know if you didn't change the driver it's probably not the graphic card.

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's kind of so you know.

164
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So I think for folks to say it's the graphics driver if it hasn't changed nothing was executed to cause an issue in that space.

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So yeah clearly we got a got a you know catching its get along as far as in that one directory got it backed up now you know what to back up in the future.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Right. Good to go. Yeah I should just make a backup of my dot Katie for you.

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Right. And so but I decided to go the boss level route and I just are in dash R.F. the whole Katie for folder I said to hell with precision.

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So that put me back at square one with my Katie config.

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Now I did something different this time. OK so here's the reason too because I got I got logged in and I sat down and I needed to get immediately to work on last.

170
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Like I thought about I thought OK I could spend 20 minutes like but it never works out that way.

171
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah you get sucked into it. That's true.

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And it also like it pushes it would push like the whole the whole release of last out like everything like when you delay at that at that level sort of like compounds because a bunch of different actions then take place later than they should.

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And so it's like I know I'm just gonna get right to work.

174
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And so I just sat down and started encoding video and working on the art and all that kind of stuff immediately.

175
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And so I thought well you know while the video is encoding the bonobo is so is so damn fast that I am encoding HD x 264 and I got to rip it on all cores.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And meanwhile I'm like installing updates I'm back and back in the packer and I'm installing more arch updates and I'm configuring all my stuff.

177
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And what I decided to do this time Matt is.

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm not going to try to keep things default.

179
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
First time on KDE I was like keep everything default and only change the stuff that really grades on me.

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But what that what that causes to happen is I don't make the change until I'm really annoyed at something.

181
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And then I'm like I got to go change that.

182
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So basically instead of being reactionary to it you're actually you're trying to map out something that's going to provide you with the experience you want.

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm gonna say you know what I need to customize it and I'm going to embrace that.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So what I did this time so the first of all that took off this whole like judginess that I had like you know is this the way I want to just got rid of all of that because when I add a stock KDE I'm very judgy.

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You know default KDE I'm full of judginess.

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So I opened up the system settings app and I just went down every single icon row by row by row until I had changed every setting the way I want it.

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And by the time I was through most of that settings application that's pretty much done.

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And this time around my KDE setup is even more amazing than before.

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And I really love it.

190
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Like I thought I liked my old setup and I remember I was kind of bummed right.

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I was kind of like oh man.

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh yeah totally.

193
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No man I like my new setup way more.

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I went a little simpler.

195
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You know I'm not trying to do like the launcher icons and all that kind of stuff like I was trying to do with the unity stuff.

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I went no I'm just I'm going to actually took your advice Matt.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm going this it's not I'm not using snaps I'm using the built in K runner launcher thing.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Good OK.

199
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But I'm just saying I'm going to just launch everything with keyboard commands so that way like I don't get muscle memory about where an icon is.

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And then and then later when I finally get frustrated and switch to XFCE I'll just load up Synapse and I'm good to go.

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's what did it for me.

202
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
For those of you that are not familiar with this I use snaps in the fact that I don't as long as it's Linux and I have that installed.

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I honestly don't care what the desktop environment is that much because I don't launch anything from anything else other than that.

204
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's also how I find my documents and find pretty much everything is how I manage my desktop.

205
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't I don't have to know where anything is.

206
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I just start typing.

207
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That was one of the things that bugged me on Gnome was that I felt like the launcher only being able to search applications in this day and age was old.

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Like I'm used to my launcher and be able to search document name.

209
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So if I have like a notes file that I type stuff into frequently you know I can I can pull that up just like I can pull up an application.

210
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Exactly.

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So we got a lot of feedback on a lot of things from yesterday's episode of Linux action show.

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But maybe we could start with the Gnome 3 stuff because that seemed to be the stuff that really pissed people off.

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh yeah.

214
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I think that's a great place to start actually.

215
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm going to go.

216
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm digging maybe.

217
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Should we start at the highs.

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That would be the YouTube.

219
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I mean look at that.

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So I'm going to dig through here.

221
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Here's a good one from Chili de Peroni.

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Matt shut the fuck up about a doc.

223
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You know and that's a fair statement it's like OK clearly this is someone that really loves docs.

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm just kidding.

225
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No I totally get it.

226
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No you know you are right.

227
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You are right.

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's that doc is like old.

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And you see what I don't know people know about is Dell made an entire ultra book that was cordless.

230
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Like even though you could hook it up to a doc.

231
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
OK I had a doc but it was a cordless doc.

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So you'd set this Dell ultra book on top of this base station but there was no wires and it would do USB Bluetooth video external video everything charging everything.

233
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
No wires.

234
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So you're not crazy.

235
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And so that's that would be more.

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:41,000
See for me it's a matter of I'm trying to actually look at this as progress and asking me to use technology that granted it's doing something new and compelling and exciting and I think that's great.

237
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't want a doc.

238
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I want to use technology that I already use on Android.

239
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't want to step backwards because for me personally I don't personally really see how a doc is fun or it just it sucks.

240
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry dude it sucks.

241
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I just there's no way around it.

242
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I can't make it not suck.

243
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And so for me it's like I don't want.

244
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Now I know there are people that are OK with it.

245
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's great.

246
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You go dock it up.

247
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Go docky dock dock.

248
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
All right now.

249
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah no no.

250
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What about this stinging critique on our evaluation of Nome three.

251
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Here we go.

252
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Damn harem writes seriously stop whining about Nome you retards.

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's the best desktop environment out there.

254
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Everything you see on screen is configurable with JavaScript.

255
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
User shared Nome shell utils JS to give him points for sticking up for obviously sticking up for desktop.

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He is very passionate about.

257
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's fine.

258
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
No problems there.

259
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You know I only will gripe about something if I care if I don't care.

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Here's a little tidbit.

261
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You guys may not know if I'm not complaining about it.

262
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's not because I don't have an opinion.

263
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's because it's I'm not emotionally invested in it.

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I may still care to a degree but I'm not emotionally invested in it.

265
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If I'm ripping on Nome it's because I want them to not suck.

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I want them to do awesome things because I know they can.

267
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
They have been in the past.

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
They probably will in the future.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's not happening right now though.

270
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yeah I think we're just critical of this philosophy of now.

271
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
One of the things we got as feedback legitimate feedback about the Nome stuff.

272
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I thought was from like Oleg here in the in the Linux action show subreddit feedback race is a little harsh in the show today about Nome.

273
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah but I don't think it went over the limit.

274
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
As far as I know no maps is mostly a Google summer of code project.

275
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So it's been done by a few new faces in the Nome Linux community.

276
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I kind of speculated about that in the show.

277
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Remember I was like yeah there had to be a reason for it.

278
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But it is kind of a slap upside the head with a brick though when you say oh look what I can do on my KDE desktop with a globe.

279
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh hey we got maps on Nome.

280
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You know you're going to go.

281
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
People are going to come to that conclusion without our help.

282
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
They just will.

283
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You know we're just kind of helping that along.

284
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So he says it's still lacking planned functionality since the new geolocation tech just landed recently.

285
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
He includes some screenshots.

286
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He says the ones in the blog post that we looked at were already outdated.

287
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:57,000
He also wanted to point out that while we were poking fun at the display manager in Nome he then links a picture of the KDE one which looks like a train wreck.

288
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Like it looks like a train wreck hitting you.

289
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I mean it's just awful.

290
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But I mean come on comparing something to KDE like that's not really a fair comparison.

291
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
He says there's lots of stuff in Nome developers are working on at the moment.

292
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Many of them are going to be landed in Nome 3.10 like the high DPI, CSD, Wayland support, OS3, free desktop.org application installer, sandboxing, etc.

293
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
All these technologies and features are going to be available for Cinnamon Elementary and many other desktops automatically.

294
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Your show your way.

295
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But I'm still a little disappointed at the way Nome was presented sometimes.

296
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It gets criticism from the exact same things that other desktops get praises.

297
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But anyway very good overall interesting discussion.

298
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Now do you think that last part is true?

299
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Do you think we criticize?

300
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I think it was extremely fair but I would put an asterisk on that and saying that personally myself and I don't know about you.

301
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I wasn't aware of any of that other stuff.

302
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I have no knowledge of it.

303
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And maybe the reason why I wasn't aware of it is not so much that I wasn't trying to find it.

304
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's just that it's not a visual thing you can point to.

305
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You can't say I see the sandbox or I see that.

306
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And we mentioned like the Wayland stuff was a footnote in that blog post.

307
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You're right.

308
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's a hard thing to visually show.

309
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But I would love now here let's put this out for the Nome guys.

310
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:14,000
If any of you guys are listening we'd love to interview you and talk about how awesome those backend things because that's something we can then wrap our heads around because we can't really visualize what that's going to be like otherwise.

311
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Without some, you know, without some context.

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah.

313
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah.

314
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'd love that.

315
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I think that'd be cool.

316
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm looking forward to the next few years as really Wayland hits.

317
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think we're going to see some interesting stuff.

318
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We're going to see people break with some of the old and go with new technologies and we'll see where things shake out.

319
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I think at the end of the day my overall anxiety for the Nome desktop and why it's ironic.

320
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I was paranoid that an ARCH update would break a Nome shell because I had one shell break and it made my session crash.

321
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So I stopped using Nome and then of course a few weeks later KDE broke on me after an update.

322
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
And I had to log into Nome to get any work done.

323
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And then it becomes a matter of really it wasn't a matter of a Nome or KDE fault.

324
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's just that's the nature of the upgrade process.

325
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Sometimes things happen.

326
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And you know I want to live with cutting edge software so I'm cool with that.

327
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Sure.

328
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So maybe I have been too hard on Nome.

329
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's only because I know I touched on it in the show yesterday.

330
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I just feel like it's heavy handed vision.

331
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It is.

332
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And see part of it is I come from a Nome 2 mindset.

333
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
As boring as sin as it was I loved it because it was simple for a long time.

334
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And so my expectations are deeply rooted in I don't know prejudice and hatred.

335
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I don't know if you want to call it that but I definitely wasn't really a big fan of the whole Nome 3 situation.

336
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I didn't like the direction.

337
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It really bothered me.

338
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I didn't feel like I was gaining something new or exciting from it.

339
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And at the time I wasn't necessarily a big fan of KDE either.

340
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And that's what of course drove me to XFCE.

341
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And you know I've looked in the mate and other ones and whatever.

342
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But so you know I don't know.

343
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I have high hopes for them.

344
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm not belittling them because I want to see them fail.

345
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm belittling them because I want to light a fire under their butts.

346
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And I want to learn more about those back end features that I'm not hearing about.

347
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's all.

348
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Blackout24 responded.

349
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He said I do understand Chris's problem with the Nome vision problem.

350
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We're a Linux power user.

351
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We want powerful and a thought through desktop.

352
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
We don't care about having Nome 3 on touch devices.

353
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Every move that shifts the balance towards mobile and therefore ruins the desktop will be met with criticism.

354
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Nome is catering to a target group that doesn't even exist.

355
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
They're just plain wrong.

356
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Imagine your parents would spend most of their time with imaginary invisible children instead of with you.

357
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's just it.

358
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I mean when I present various desktops to non Linux users.

359
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'd never ever have had a person that took a look at Nome 3 and said oh I like that.

360
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Most of them said OK what the hell.

361
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That was generally.

362
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yeah.

363
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah I mean it was it was a use.

364
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I mean they went from being the usability desktop to the what the hell desktop.

365
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And that's not and that's not to say they won't correct that.

366
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
But right now I'm just not feeling it.

367
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And most people I know aren't either.

368
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So you know.

369
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes sir.

370
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
All right.

371
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So one last point.

372
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Blackout 24 says that the reason why this might make someone angry is Linux has 10 plus you know 10 to the power of 10 window managers and desktop environments.

373
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:15,000
But let's face it there's only three projects that have the manpower to deliver a desktop that is polished enough to compete with the windows and the Mac OS 10.

374
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's Nome KD and unity.

375
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If one of them acts irrational it pains us as Linux users.

376
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Just look at the Nome weather app.

377
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Why on earth would someone want this on a desktop.

378
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I have no idea.

379
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And that's you know it's like even if I try not to belittle the stuff it's like it they do it for me.

380
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I mean really.

381
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's like you don't want to criticize someone's work because you really appreciate the people are getting out there and creating code and all of that.

382
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Sure.

383
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I guess if it comes free like if it's part of like a you know crazy Google's giving out Google bucks and you know just go out there and create some code that nobody needs.

384
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And then you know well somebody created this and it's GTK and it's super minimal.

385
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
So let's put it in Nome.

386
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Is that what's happening.

387
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It seems like it.

388
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And you know it's obviously stuff that they're passionate about and a lot of times a lot of open source projects are in fact derived based on personal needs.

389
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Someone needs something made for themselves for their company whatever it is and they'll go out and create that and that's fine.

390
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But it does feel like a lot of that mindsets being incorporated into Nome and that almost the shuttle worth style of I know best.

391
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
And if you if you don't see what I know and you don't understand why this is a benefit screw you you're broken inside and you don't understand you know and then more power to them.

392
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That's their view of it.

393
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You know for me I'm just not able to fall in love with its current direction.

394
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't.

395
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
They're building a you know for touch interface that nobody wants.

396
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
They're incorporating things that I don't understand.

397
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And the really cool stuff that this person listed off in the email earlier.

398
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I want to hear more about that.

399
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I want to see less of the map thing and I want to know more about the sandbox and I want to know more about all this stuff in the back and that does sound compelling.

400
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That does interest me.

401
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yeah that that sounds worthwhile.

402
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
That has value.

403
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah I agree a lot of people.

404
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So I don't know.

405
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Blackout went on to make some really other great points.

406
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The chairman wants me to read his whole point but you know I'll just say summarize.

407
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's a it's it's really good.

408
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I mean he kind of points out you know how people will say that it's not really designed for a touch UI that is not touch first but it really is when you kind of consider that's frightening if it's not then my God what are they.

409
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Wow.

410
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
OK.

411
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I mean he makes some good points about the notification area as well.

412
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So I wanted to we have I want to talk about the Proxmox project.

413
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,000
They've just recently done an update that is not going very well for them and we've covered Proxmox on the show.

414
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
We've a lot of people a lot of people have ended up using it because of our coverage.

415
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I was thinking about deploying it here at my house coming up but now there's a bit of a road bump on talk about that.

416
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Maybe we could also talk about some of our favorite ways to customize our desktops now that I just kind of got done tweaking my KDE setup.

417
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah.

418
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And then DHVL in the subreddit has some tough questions for you and I about Canonical and Ubuntu.

419
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And we got a ton of bit message stuff like the bit message stuff went over well and some people sent over some some really neat projects around Bitcoin.

420
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So got some good stuff Matt.

421
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But before we go any further I want to stop and thank our first sponsor this week Ting.

422
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Ting.com is mobile.

423
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That makes sense.

424
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And if you go to Linux.ting.com.

425
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
This is a different code than for the big show Linux.ting.com.

426
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And this will get you twenty five dollars off your first device or your Ting service.

427
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Now friends you might say Ting service Chris do tell me more.

428
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Well Ting is pay for what you use and not a cent more.

429
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You don't end up putting a bunch of money into a big contract.

430
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You don't end up actually needing all of and also there's no bundling.

431
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
There's no secret hidden things that show up on your bills just what you use in any legal taxes Ting has to charge you.

432
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
That's it.

433
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And on top of that you also get things like a hotspot and tethering.

434
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That's all fine and good.

435
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I really like Ting as a company that lets you either be completely hands off completely hands off or completely just dig in and get into the community aspect of things get into the tech behind things.

436
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
They've got resources for both sides of the camp.

437
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
They also have some small business.

438
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
If you've got maybe a group of people five ten twenty thirty forty more Ting has some really innovative business small business plans.

439
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You might want to go check out Ting makes an excellent option for a small team.

440
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So go over to Linux.ting.com and check out the rates.

441
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Check out their payment calculator.

442
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
You can go over there a little savings calculator.

443
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You put in your bill into that.

444
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Tell that bad boy what's up how much your bill is and you'll see the savings.

445
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You'll be pretty shocked at that point.

446
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I think you're going to be compelled to go forward.

447
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Also Ting just rolled out a brand new service will go out and find you a refurbished Ting compatible device.

448
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And when you use our actually it's a URL.

449
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
We don't have a code.

450
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Linux.ting.com you get twenty five dollars off that device.

451
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:57,000
So I'll tell you as someone who just recently has switched to Ting I am amazed at how simple it was to set up how easy it is to manage and the fact that I know exactly what my bills going to be based on what I do.

452
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's totally my ballpark.

453
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
The dashboard is super easy to use super straightforward.

454
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You go in there you get gas gauges that tell you right where you're at.

455
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Give you a visual representation.

456
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It tells you right now this is how much you're going to look at paying like if I go in there right now it's like sixteen bucks for me or something like that.

457
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah same here.

458
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It's like literally it's like twelve or sixteen bucks.

459
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
It's crazy.

460
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
And they have a bunch of really great devices including the wonderful magnificent Note 2 and HDC one.

461
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
And I have it on a little birdie tells me we're going to see some really exciting devices coming here very soon as well.

462
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
They've got a great deal right now on the Samsung Galaxy S3 16 gig addition.

463
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This is unlocked.

464
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
No contract.

465
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You own this.

466
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You are in complete control of the relationship with the mobile provider when you go this route.

467
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Think about the difference that is there.

468
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You know I just have to put it in the track the stark terms that it is in the traditional telco setup.

469
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You're essentially a victim.

470
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
They lock you into this contract.

471
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:02,000
They incentivize you with this phone that they subsidize to a lower price because they charge you so much more than what it actually cost them to have you on as a customer.

472
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
They make so much profit off you.

473
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
They subsidize those cell phones to a lower rate.

474
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
When you when you buy in at that level you always are behind the ball.

475
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You're always are disadvantaged.

476
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
The position of power is always held by the telco.

477
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Ting flips all of that on its head.

478
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You're in power.

479
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's your phone.

480
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It's your contract.

481
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You own it and you only pay for what you use.

482
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Go to linux.ting.com and thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

483
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I think that's what you really nailed it there is that you know the other telcos have you in an enforceable contract.

484
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Now think about that.

485
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I mean they can do it.

486
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
They're in control of when you are in or out of their service.

487
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Not you.

488
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And that sucks.

489
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And we've seen what they do with that.

490
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
We've seen what they do with that.

491
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Oh my goodness yes.

492
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's and that was what that is what makes me so nervous about payments going to phones.

493
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Like I know that's a huge thing that Android wants to do with the Google Wallet.

494
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm sure Apple is going to do something.

495
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm sure Microsoft would if they could.

496
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And I the anything that puts these.

497
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I mean the telcos and the banks together really like that's like that sounds like the worst thing of all.

498
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Now if only we could get a bunch of regulation involved so the government's got a heavy hand in it too.

499
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Absolutely.

500
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Especially if we make sure that the people doing the regulations are the people that used to work in those industries.

501
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Right.

502
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That's important.

503
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Of course.

504
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That way they have experience.

505
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And a vested interest.

506
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
A cough cough.

507
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
All right.

508
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So why don't we start with the Proxmox stuff because this is just kind of quick.

509
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And I in the chat room is just saying hey you should mention this before the show.

510
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But we do have a few folks in the on air channel.

511
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:45,000
So I thought we'd go to them and see if anybody in the on air channel has anything they want to chime in with before we move on because it's an open floor right now guys.

512
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
They're probably listening non-delay well.

513
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah.

514
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I just wanted to kind of weigh in on it.

515
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And I don't know if anybody's read the article or any coverage of it yet but they released three dot one.

516
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And what they changed is that you have to have a subscription in order to access the stable repo.

517
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Does that mean you can use the beta version of Proxmox if you don't subscribe.

518
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Essentially.

519
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
But the source is still available.

520
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So if you get the source you can still compile it yourself and do it that way.

521
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:23,000
You just won't have that that easy peasy you know access to the repo right from the get go once you put your subscription in there.

522
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And are you a Proxmox user.

523
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I am a Proxmox user.

524
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I've been running it for several months now and I really like it.

525
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
It's very easy to use and things like that.

526
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And they've actually introduced a subscription that's low enough that's meant for community users.

527
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And I believe it's fifty to sixty dollars annually that will give you access to the stable repo.

528
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So if you don't really need you know help or support and things like that you're capable of taking care of things on your own.

529
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
You could just get this community subscription which in the long run isn't terrible.

530
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I believe Xbox Live costs more than that and you can still have access to the stable repo and things like that.

531
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:24,000
But the concern from the community seems to be that there's not a clear indicator as to what's going to go into the unstable repo and what people are going to lose.

532
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So it seems like the devs are the ones that are handling the PR of this situation.

533
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And they seem to be doing it poorly because their interaction within their forums seems to become more and more negative.

534
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:53,000
And right now it seems like they need to release something that is more clear cut about what's going to happen to the community of people that don't pay for a subscription but they really enjoy their product.

535
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So look at it just so that I am kind of tracking you.

536
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:05,000
So what you're saying as an existing Proxmox user if future updates right now it looks like if you don't subscribe will only be quote unquote unstable updates.

537
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Am I following you and you don't actually know what is going to happen?

538
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
That's what it seems like.

539
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I haven't delved deep into it as to what the details.

540
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Like I said they haven't really come out with a lot of information about what goes into the unstable.

541
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But if you had let's say a 3.0 installation right now and you upgraded to 3.1 you would lose the stable repo and you would only have the PDE test or the testing repo.

542
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And I don't know if you actually lose any features from 3.0.

543
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I don't believe you do.

544
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You just won't have the stable repo for you.

545
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So it sounds like you know best case scenario the direction they're going that you have a you have a working setup they offer an upgrade.

546
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:59,000
If you choose not to do a subscription you're either basically stuck with what you have or you can then go to source or basically end up in beta.

547
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yeah that's exactly right.

548
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
OK wow wow.

549
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yeah so it sounds like too that now this sometimes happens it's kind of hard to read but they say that you over on their official forums developers are like Lickety said are the ones that they're interacting with and sometimes when the thread start to get a little hostile they're shutting them down.

550
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
That's not too uncommon.

551
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And that's the wrong approach to see.

552
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
One of the gigs that I work is I'm the guy that works in between developers and the community and that's bad.

553
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You don't do that.

554
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
You never do that.

555
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You have a you have a dialogue with those folks.

556
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
They're ripping you a new one have the dialogue get it out in the open talk about it.

557
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Don't hide it.

558
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Don't run away from it.

559
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh that's bad.

560
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yeah yeah.

561
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Don't do that.

562
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
All right.

563
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Any any other thoughts here in the on air channel of floor is open.

564
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Going once going twice.

565
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
OK.

566
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
All right.

567
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Well I'll leave the leave the channel open if somebody is on delay and they and they want to tune in.

568
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Well I appreciate you guys bringing the Proxmox stuff to our attention because yeah we've covered them and be thinking about running it here in my house because right now I have two physical machines and I have a virtual box headless on one of them.

569
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And I would like to maybe just consolidate down to one physical machine and go Proxmox and say goodbye to virtual box and say goodbye to two machines because when it's warm out it is a real pain in the ass to have all these computers on.

570
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Oh yeah.

571
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Just bake you alive.

572
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah yeah.

573
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
OK before we get to the KD custom or just desktop customization stuff.

574
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Let's let's clear out the canonical stuff.

575
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Let's get let's let's get this done with.

576
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,000
We talked a lot about Ubuntu touch yesterday and specifically the Ubuntu edge campaign.

577
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And I thought we had some good points on there and overall pretty good pretty good feedback.

578
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Some people thought we were a little hard.

579
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
DHVL in the subreddit says the question is not simply about the Ubuntu edge campaign.

580
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I should say I'm an Ubuntu user. I'm not an Ubuntu user. I'm a Fedora 19 user with KD and I love it.

581
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
My question is what exactly is canonical slash Ubuntu's focus right now.

582
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Consider this. Wow. Now this is kind of ironic. Now I'm not sure what he's about to say next Matt.

583
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I do find some irony in a Red Hat user asking what another distro's focus is but I mean a Fedora user but that's OK. No judge. No judge.

584
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Fedora is a Red Hat testbed for new technologies.

585
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Oh see they hate it when you call it that.

586
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
And Red Hat is going to use that Red Hat is going to use for enterprise Linux.

587
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,000
OpenSUSE is a distro that is perfect for KD and has good security and it has Yas 2 which is one of the best GUI configuration tools ever.

588
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Arch Linux is for Linux users who don't mind any amount of hassle and want bleeding edge software and like to have a fully customized distro.

589
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But what the hell is Ubuntu for? I can't say it's for new users because Unity is not really all that user friendly.

590
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Neither can I say it's good for introduction to Linux because well no other distro that I know of uses Upstart or Unity or PPAs or any of that stuff.

591
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Oh so it's not good for learning other cross skills I guess.

592
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
It's not. And if you guys haven't seen it yet a really good video to watch is Chris Perillo's dad uses Ubuntu.

593
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And that is a great example of what you were just saying as far as it's not really a great distribution for new users because they don't know where the hell to find anything.

594
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
It's something that gets activated. They don't know how to deal with it or how to get out of it or minimize it or whatnot.

595
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Yeah I'd say that's pretty spot on. Ubuntu is definitely kind of losing its edge there.

596
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I've parked people in front of it. I was with you until I saw that video and it's like this is someone that's been using computers longer than a lot of our audience has been alive.

597
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Well okay you're right. So I would grant you if your only usability metric is how easy it is to figure out how to...

598
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Well I mean Unity's got that big old bar on the side with the big old Firefox icon in there.

599
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Launching is easy. It's managing that can get a little weird.

600
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Yeah I mean launching is brain dead simple. I mean it's not that hard to do.

601
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But yeah I think where he really got lost is when you went into the multiple desktops and he was trying to figure out how to get back.

602
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Now we of course know how to get out of that but a lot of people are thinking okay what happened? Did I break something? What's going on with my display? They've never seen it before.

603
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Alright so I think you got for that type of user I think maybe your elementary OS might be a better route right?

604
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Right.

605
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Your Pantheon desktop experience as it were.

606
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Exactly.

607
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And then I look at you got your user who knows how to use the computer.

608
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Sure.

609
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And they're comfortable enough maybe like maybe they've set up a printer before you know that kind of level of user right?

610
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Okay sure.

611
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I feel like for them Ubuntu is the quote unquote easiest distribution to use because there's such a broad amount of resources out there for somebody making the transition.

612
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Somebody new. There's so much. There's Ask Ubuntu. There's OMG Ubuntu. There's all of the web update. All of the different sites out there that tailor to Ubuntu users.

613
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
How do you do this? Click this button. Install this software. Copy these commands.

614
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Not necessarily always the greatest advice but very straightforward for anybody that has at least savvy enough to craft a half reasonable Google response.

615
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You know they're going to get instructions.

616
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Yeah they will. When I used to regularly update my matthartley.com website most of the people I had coming in were refugees from bad advice from the Ubuntu forums.

617
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The advice that a lot of the people were getting there was so over complicated, overdone, over baked, burnt bad advice that it about made me cry.

618
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Yeah.

619
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:25,000
So there's that and then on top of that fact putting the community totally aside. I'm not ranking in the community. I'm saying there's a lot of very active people that don't know what they're talking about.

620
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
On top of that the fact that the desktop is constantly evolving. I think it was the next release of Ubuntu that Unity is almost unusable.

621
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
This is a problem. This for new users is a huge issue.

622
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And you know the reputation is, so I watch this, there I am, Sunday. I'm editing the Linux action show. A lot of times I pull up Uncle Leo and I'm watching what Lafferty is doing during his national radio show.

623
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And he gets the Dell Ultrabook that runs the Linux.

624
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Oh the Sputnik or the...

625
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yeah, yeah. Made by Dell for developers, right? So he gets that thing. He opens it up, puts it on his desk. He's got the IRC chat room going right there on his screen.

626
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And immediately before dude has even logged into his brand new Sputnik, chat room starts telling him, get rid of Unity. Unity is no good. Can't use Unity.

627
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And Leo's like, oh, I gotta get rid of Unity? Well, so what do I do?

628
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:32,000
First thing he does, dude, first thing he does, he opens up the terminal sudo apt-get zubuntu desktop. And so then he installs his zubuntu desktop on top of the standard Ubuntu desktop, which is not exactly perfect.

629
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
It's pretty messy. Yeah.

630
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And then he just logs out and starts using it. Never even bothers. Like he got through the intro video that Dell puts on there and then closed it.

631
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And so then caller calls up, you know, a few days, a few weeks later. I can't remember this. I think so.

632
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I think he got the Sputnik like this was months ago. And then I was watching Laperty this last Sunday. Caller calls in because it was a Linux birthday.

633
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And he says, hey, Leo, I'm thinking about getting a computer to run Linux. What do you think?

634
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And Leo says, gosh, I tell you, I bought the Dell Linux laptop and it was such a horrible out of the box experience.

635
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
First of all, it comes with this desktop environment that canonicals made that nobody likes. He never even tried it.

636
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
He says nobody likes. This is only he says multiple. He says million listeners in a national radio show.

637
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And he says, so don't buy the Sputnik laptop. Just go buy a Windows laptop and put Linux on there if you want.

638
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
That's not necessarily absolutely wrong on every possible level.

639
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
The problem is the problem is it's not necessarily based on any actual practical use.

640
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It's based on like this folklore that happens so often on the Internet.

641
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:43,000
This this I.T. folklore where we pass legends on to each other about something and we just accept it.

642
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So I guess my point is, is I I feel like I feel like maybe Cinnamon, maybe, you know, maybe elementary OS is a better new user desktop.

643
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It's more familiar. Yeah, I agree with that. See, this is this is the rub.

644
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I don't hate economical. I don't hate Ubuntu. I don't.

645
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
I dislike Unity for the direction it's going. See, again, people tend to like run hot and cold when when I'm when I'm explaining this.

646
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I want to be clear on this. I don't hate Unity. I hate where Unity is headed.

647
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
It's current Unity on 1210. I could you know, it's a very nice desktop. I have no problem with it.

648
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,000
It works fine. But I think where it's headed is it's heading in a very bumpy beta like direction that's not going to give a good experience to people.

649
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Now, Leo, of course, is just talking out of his his backside because he's not tried it and it was just basically going based on community feedback.

650
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And that's unfortunate. But I think that the Ubuntu core itself, when you are free to try out Cinnamon, you're free to try out these other desktops or even try other related distributions is actually a very solid experience.

651
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yeah, it really is. Now, again, do I hate Unity? Absolutely not. Do I hate where Unity is headed? Yes.

652
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Current Unity 1210. You know, it's a very comfortable desktop. It works very well.

653
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You know, 1204, 1210 is fine. 1210 and just the Amazon stuff.

654
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Yeah, I think I'm running. What the heck am I running?

655
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
1304 was probably, I thought, one of their best implementations.

656
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Yeah, I think. No, that's what I'm running. I'm sorry. It's 1304. I get all their numbers and names all mixed up because I got all the weird stuff going on.

657
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
But yeah, so I'm running 1304. I just checked. But yeah, I don't know.

658
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I guess I want to toss it to the to the Mumble room. I see that Riley just joined us and we have a few other folks.

659
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
And I don't know if you guys in there have any thoughts on it.

660
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So, Mumble folks, do you agree with DVH on the subreddit that Canonical is lacking focus for Ubuntu?

661
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,000
His argument is that they're not focusing enough on the desktop. Matt's argument, the desktop isn't user friendly enough anymore.

662
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Anybody in the Mumble room want to agree or disagree?

663
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Yeah, I'll give an opinion. I tend to be the IT person for friends and family.

664
00:41:50,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So I end up, you know, handing out USB sticks with Linux on it and trying to get people to install it when they're complaining about it's not working right or so forth because Windows is sort of just messy and I don't like dealing with it.

665
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So, yeah. So what I end up gravitating to is trying to get people on Linux Mint.

666
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It has a very easy interface, which I would say is I would say it's a lot like XP or where XP would be if they built on top of it and stuck very closely with it.

667
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And I've heard other people sort of say a sort of say similar things to that effect.

668
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Right. I can see that. Yeah. So and with and after and for me, I used to use Ubuntu.

669
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And about when they and I'm sorry, I'm not structuring my sentences very well.

670
00:42:47,000 --> 00:43:00,000
But when they introduced the Amazon lenses in the Unity HUD, that sort of I lost my faith in Ubuntu as a distribution to deliver a trustable distribution.

671
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I thought that was I thought, you know, you're you're trying to market towards me.

672
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
You know, it's enough to put a big button in your application asking for donations.

673
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:19,000
That's fine. But to actually put marketing, I mean, that would be the equivalent of in the Windows eight start menu.

674
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
You had like Google ad boxes. Yeah. I mean, I think that's just ridiculous.

675
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And I jump ship. I got you. Anyone else want to chime in? Yeah. Go ahead, Corn.

676
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I was just going to say that I used to be a big long time Ubuntu user back like what?

677
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Maybe 10, 10 at least before they went to Unity. I didn't like Unity so much back then when it first came out.

678
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I think like when 12 or four hit, I went ahead and I went tried to do the whole unit thing.

679
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I didn't like it so much. But if I were to, I guess, say, suggest a Linux distribution for some first time users,

680
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I personally would choose Zorin OS because, yeah, it is based off, you know, a derivative of Ubuntu.

681
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
But it's just more like Windows user friendly. And I had someone had a computer problem where their hard drive was going bad.

682
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I later found that out. And I didn't really want to install Windows because obviously I didn't own Windows and I didn't have anything free.

683
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So I was like, I'll just sneak a Windows like clone on there. And I threw Zorin OS on there.

684
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Dude had no idea what it was. He thought it was like some new version of Windows.

685
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And he was like, oh, and there's an app store. This is amazing. That's all right.

686
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Remember Zorin OS was the one we looked at where it's like, which UI would you like to emulate?

687
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Mac, Windows, Windows XP. That was kind of as like, oh, yeah, this is totally for Windows convert.

688
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So nice one, Corn. That sounds exactly what it's. Yeah, I think that's a great example.

689
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
What were you going to say, Riley? Yeah, I'd actually take that a step further and even say Manjaro is easier than Ubuntu.

690
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Because when you think about it, hey, when you think about it, Manjaro, you never have to reinstall.

691
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:05,000
It comes with all your proprietary codecs and your graphics card support. And on top of that, you got the AUR.

692
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I would add to that. I would say that, yes, I'm running Manjaro full time and I'm very happy with it.

693
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I would say that if based, being honest, and I used to do support people that knew nothing about computers.

694
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I used to teach classes on this stuff. I'm fairly familiar with people that know nothing of PCs.

695
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
If it's set up for them, absolutely 120% agree with you.

696
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Gosh, that's XFCE. That is the best looking XFCE I have ever seen. Wow.

697
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:37,000
The thing about using something like Manjaro too is the forums and community.

698
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
If you add something in the Ubuntu forums, good luck.

699
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I remember Matt, you said something about this a while back in the last, I think it was during the Arch review.

700
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But if you add something in the Ubuntu forums, you got 20 different people telling you to do something different.

701
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Conflicting advice, too.

702
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yeah, on Manjaro or Arch, it's this way and that's pretty much it.

703
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:10,000
That's exactly right. Yeah, I would totally agree with that because for me, I've actually looked at setting up Manjaro on some computers for family members.

704
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,000
With me setting it up so I know that they're not having to try and figure out why PacMac is doing something weird or whatever.

705
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
There's little bugs that come along because it's still a little bit beta to a degree.

706
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
But it's a really good distribution once it's set up.

707
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And what's cool is if you outgrow the gooey stuff and you want to just roll Pacman and just go straight terminal, you can do that too.

708
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It works really well. And of course, you get your Arch repos.

709
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Now, I got to state this for the record, Manjaro is not Arch. It's based on Arch.

710
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I want to be very clear on that. So it's a very, very, very different experience for very, very different goals.

711
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But it's a great distribution and I'm really happy with it.

712
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And you do have the regular straight up, I mean, it has the AUR, right?

713
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, anything you do on Arch package wise is doable on Manjaro.

714
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So I keep thinking if I have to reload, I'm either going to try Antegros or however you say it, or Manjaro, but I'm not sure which one.

715
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I don't know. I mean, I might just go straight Arch again, but everybody keeps raving about these.

716
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I want to just see them. I want to try it. See if it really does break.

717
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Of course, on Manjaro, they actually have the Wiki on the CD itself.

718
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So you don't have to go to a website to view the Wiki. It's all on a PDF document on a CD.

719
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And it's got Ubuntu style hardware detection too. I mean, there's no – I don't do anything hardware wise.

720
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
The only thing that was a little funky was the printer setup and that was just my own idiocy.

721
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
That was literally just a forehead slap later and I was fine.

722
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,000
But yeah, generally speaking, there's going to be some bumps when you first install it until you get a package update.

723
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
PacMac might throw up an error or whatever. Just go to the forms. You'll have it straightened out in no time.

724
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
But once you get it set up, yeah, it's great because I'll never again have to upgrade Squad.

725
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
But for a new user, Matt? For a new user?

726
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
For a new user, if it's set up for them. That's the key factor. Once it's set up, you're fine.

727
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I've not had one problem. Setting it up, no. Absolutely not for a new user.

728
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
But I'd say – well, unless they're maybe an experienced Linux user coming from Ubuntu.

729
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
These mythical new users we always talk about. I mean, if they –

730
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
There's two types though. There's the new to Linux and then there's the I can run Windows kind of.

731
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Yeah. And one category though isn't going to be able to install a distro no matter how easy it is

732
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
because they can probably barely install Windows software.

733
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Exactly. And so that, of course, is your category if you're installing it for them. And you would with Windows anyway.

734
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
So my philosophy is if you're installing Windows for them, you're going to install Mengero for them.

735
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,000
If they're installing Ubuntu themselves, they can probably install Mengero just fine.

736
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I wouldn't say there's really a big deal there.

737
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Interesting. All right, guys. Well, before we go to our next topic.

738
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And so Mumble Room, if you guys want to think about something for your –

739
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
if anybody has something they want to say, think on that.

740
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Take a quick break though because I want to thank our second sponsor this week.

741
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And that is UnitySync from Directory Wizards.

742
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Now, Matt, back in the day. Back in the day, Matt.

743
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Back in the day.

744
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,000
So I worked two types of jobs that dealt with this issue where you have these – well, we called them data islands.

745
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I don't know if that's what the kids call them anymore, Matt.

746
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,000
But a data island was one of these situations where you had an application that had its own directory,

747
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,000
maybe a database server, maybe an LDAP, maybe it's an access database, all kinds of stuff.

748
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
You'd have one server that has this for like this application and one server that has it for another application.

749
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And the two types of jobs that I ran into this all the time, I happened to do this kind of work for a very long time.

750
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So it was a constant struggle.

751
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I worked at a bank that was constantly buying smaller banks and these smaller banks always had their own systems.

752
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Always, always.

753
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And I worked as an IT contractor and I was constantly going in right after a merger and the IT guy had quit or been fired.

754
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And there was always data islands.

755
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I mean, I lived this problem that UnitySync solves for so long.

756
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
So what is UnitySync?

757
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
It's a centralized service that synchronizes data between directories.

758
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
LDAP, maybe Exchange LDAP, eDirectory, we're talking all of them.

759
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Oh yeah, definitely.

760
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
The goal of UnitySync is to provide an organization with a unified view of their different directories.

761
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,000
UnitySync can scale from a small directory with hundreds of objects to something like the enterprise scale,

762
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
consisting of hundreds of thousands of objects without requiring any kind of extensive training.

763
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
It's got a super easy to use web UI.

764
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You load it on your Linux box or a Windows box, log into the web UI, set up your commands, run dry runs, get email reports,

765
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:37,000
see what's going on, interact with the Perl scripting interface if you want to go even deeper, and then synchronize directories.

766
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
That's really what it's all about.

767
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
You can get the different account information between directories, so each information contains a unified view.

768
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
You could just do single attributes.

769
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:50,000
By defining an authoritative data source, you can have one system update individual attributes of both existing objects of another.

770
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And you could also do both.

771
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Of course, it works on Active Directory, Exchange 5.5.

772
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
You've got an old Exchange box, Oracle's Internet Directory, Zimbra, which I love.

773
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
We haven't been talking a lot, but I love it.

774
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Lotus Groupwise, Microsoft SQL, Microsoft Access, which, oh my God, that would have saved me so much time.

775
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Oracle Sybase.

776
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Oh, no kidding, right?

777
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Access alone.

778
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Oh, man.

779
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The initial front-end teller system, the bank that I worked at had, all ran off of Access.

780
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:27,000
And each branch required, because of that, each branch required its own terminal server with its own Access database.

781
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So at one point, we literally had 44 different Access databases for each branch, and then we would have to pull data together from all of those.

782
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I mean, UnitySync would have literally saved multiple jobs.

783
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I mean, it is absolutely incredible.

784
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
So if you're not a programmer, no problem.

785
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
But if you are, then you can get into that Perl interface.

786
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
You throw it on your Linux box.

787
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Enterprise-grade software under five megabytes.

788
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Some huge customers.

789
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Go over to durwiz.com slash UnitySync.

790
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Check out that customer list.

791
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And then you know what I'm talking about.

792
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
The companies in that list are quite impressive, and I got a good deal for you, too.

793
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:09,000
If you click on that download link, enter in the code LINUX, and you'll get a 30-day trial, an extended trial, and your first year of maintenance for free if you decide to pull the trigger.

794
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
That's a pretty good deal.

795
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Nice.

796
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Yeah.

797
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So thanks to Directory Wizards for sponsoring Linux Action.

798
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
You'll love to see this kind of software.

799
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
And by the way, moved over to Linux based on customer demand.

800
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Ported to Linux and built from the ground up to be a great Linux solution, and it runs right on that machine.

801
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
It's super easy to use with that web interface, too.

802
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So go to durwiz.com and check out UnitySync.

803
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
You'll probably become the hero of your IT department.

804
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Nice.

805
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Oh, I would think so.

806
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I mean, imagine not only time you're saving, but just the amount of man hours and dollars.

807
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I know, right?

808
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Okay, Mumble Room.

809
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Last chance before we move on to our final topic for the day.

810
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Anybody got anything they want to add to the conversation?

811
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I just wanted to say, if I can, that it's very clear to me that if we're talking about new users,

812
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
that we're talking about a Windows-like experience where the elements of the forms don't move into like the header bar,

813
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
like they also are going to do now in Gnome 3, which is why I don't like that.

814
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And that the doc thing that's very Mac-like, if people move to Mac, that's also very different.

815
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
But if people move to Mac, that's a conscious decision.

816
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
If people move to Linux, they're already skeptical.

817
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
That's an excellent point.

818
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Actually, that's an excellent point.

819
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
So where does that leave us then?

820
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
So what you're saying is maybe it's futile to try to emulate the legacy desktop?

821
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Or are you saying if we don't emulate the legacy desktop, then we won't be that refuge?

822
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I think things like Cinnamon are a very good incentive for people to move from Windows XP to Linux,

823
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
and that's why I think things like Cinnamon are good.

824
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And also, desktops like Unity are very good for people that like them,

825
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,000
but they're not very good for new users because the close button suddenly moves into the top banner

826
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
and people lose it and stuff.

827
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Moving UI elements kills, and hiding elements, and canonical nodes is a bad practice,

828
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
but the way they hide that file and edit menu, users, this is why Windows 8 has suffered,

829
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
they are not like the techies that we want to dig in and we want to find.

830
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I love finding all the Easter eggs and almost every other day I discover something completely new about KDE

831
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
and it's just so awesome, right?

832
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
That is not their outlook at all.

833
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
That is not a good thing in their mind.

834
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
If a UI element moves to them, they're not going to go hunting for it.

835
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
They're not going to tuck their mouse in the corner to see what happens.

836
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
They're not going to hover over a blank area and see if all of a sudden a mythical menu

837
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
that should or should not be there pops up, or is it in the gear this time?

838
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I'm not quite sure.

839
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
This doesn't work.

840
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Well, I think it's a great point because it's like the way we look at computers is the way a chef

841
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
might look at gourmet cooking.

842
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I burn cereal.

843
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I literally pour it in a bowl and it sets itself on fire.

844
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It's just not my skill set, and so not everybody is going to want an advanced experience

845
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
in everything they do.

846
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Some people do, some people don't.

847
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
So I think computers definitely fall into that category, and I agree completely that for newer users,

848
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
the stick and the carrot really is a desktop that feels similar to where they're coming from.

849
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I think that's more appealing in getting them to try something newer to make the switch completely.

850
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
All right, but then let me ask you this.

851
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Maybe canonical is right all along.

852
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Maybe Microsoft is right.

853
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Maybe they shouldn't have fired Balmer because maybe the only answer really is,

854
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
is screw us old fogies.

855
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Somebody in a YouTube comment said five years from now we're going to look back at yesterday's episode

856
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
of the Linux Action Show and think it was quaint that we had all these opinions about convergence.

857
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Sure.

858
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Fair point.

859
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
But we're sticking the muds, is essentially what he's saying.

860
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You guys are sticking the muds.

861
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
This problem you guys are trying to solve, is this UI good for new users or is that UI not?

862
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Eliminate all of it.

863
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Just get rid of all of it and just reboot.

864
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
You have one device.

865
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
You learn to use that device.

866
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
It does multiple things.

867
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
You learn at once, and you just use that thing to do all those.

868
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Well, let me paint you a very, very real picture, and it actually involves an article about the myth

869
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
that young people are really great with computers.

870
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
They actually showed that that was false.

871
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
They're really good with mobile devices.

872
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
They're not good with computers.

873
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
They're absolutely useless with computers, and that's because that's how they were brought up into

874
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
the touch thing that Chris and I have talked about on the show.

875
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Now, the adults, the people that were brought up with keyboards and mice and whatnot,

876
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
that's the world we live in, and unless something's changed and we've become the lord of the flies,

877
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
the kids have not taken over quite yet, so we have a transition period that we still need to cater

878
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
to people that still want to use things in a legacy fashion.

879
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Now, for the future, I completely agree that we're going to laugh at the way we use computers.

880
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I totally understand that, but you can't just go hot to cold water.

881
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
You need to warm it up a little bit.

882
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
You need to make that transition slow, and I think that's what Ubuntu is trying to do with their

883
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
integration with the desktop and the phone and all that, but what they did with Unity was

884
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
they pushed pretty hard, and that's fine, and it's serving its purpose and whatnot,

885
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,000
but I think that people coming from Windows, you're still leaving a lot of them on the table.

886
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
A lot of people aren't going to necessarily adapt themselves to Unity right out of the box,

887
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
so I'm not running hot and cold on any one subject.

888
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I believe there's a time and a place for everything, but I think that this,

889
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
while you're either in one camp or another, it's just silly.

890
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yes, this is actually the article, and read it.

891
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
It will challenge anyone.

892
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:34,000
You know, I spent time, I think I mentioned it recently, I spent time at the local school district,

893
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
and I definitely felt that.

894
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I definitely felt like kids were good with mobile, but it wasn't that they were bad with computers,

895
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
they just didn't hold any interest.

896
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:48,000
When I say they're bad, my nephew, 16 years old, very bright, he's shown me stuff on my Android phone

897
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I didn't know about.

898
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
You park him in front of any operating system, I pop open a terminal or I do anything remotely

899
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,000
like installing a driver and he thinks I'm a hacker.

900
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I'm not kidding.

901
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
This is our future, and so read this article.

902
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I'll just leave it there.

903
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Read this article.

904
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I will link it in the show notes for folks, which I've been putting together at this show.

905
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
No show notes ahead of time, assembling them as I go.

906
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Yeah, that's great.

907
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Good stuff.

908
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
But yeah, I mean, long story short, different strokes for different folks.

909
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I mean, that's really what I'm saying.

910
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I'm not belittling any one thing or nothing of that sort.

911
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I'm just simply saying there are no absolutes in this space.

912
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
There really aren't.

913
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Yeah.

914
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And I want to, I just wanted, before we wrap up today, because I don't think we're going

915
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
to get to the desktop customizing stuff, but maybe we'll talk about that maybe next week.

916
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Yeah.

917
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
We got more show coming.

918
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
There's more show.

919
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
But one thing that really did quite well, the bit message segment seemed to play really

920
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
well with the audience.

921
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Yeah.

922
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So looking at my bit messages right now, they've been rolling in all day.

923
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
That's awesome.

924
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I've been getting people trying it out.

925
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Also, sent along, we were talking about one of the things that was kind of holding bit

926
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
message back potentially would be the integration with existing services.

927
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
That way you could have essentially like a multi-client, like Thunderbird could have

928
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
a bit message option.

929
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Right?

930
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I love that idea.

931
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Yeah.

932
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
So anonymous on bit message, because using bit message, if you wanted to, but you can

933
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
be totally anonymous, he says, I found something interesting that you might be able to use

934
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
with bit message.

935
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
It's called BitMessage Email Gateway.

936
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It allows you to view your bit messages in an email client, such as Thunderbird, Outlook,

937
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
et cetera.

938
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,000
You just have to enable the BitMessage Client API, which is easy to do by adding a few settings

939
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
in a dat file.

940
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Also, the developer of this program has a hosted solution with a webmail UI for sending

941
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:38,000
and receiving bit messages, plus it also supports sending and receiving regular email as well.

942
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:45,000
There's a hosted solution at bitmessage.ch and then also a version you can download the

943
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
code yourself.

944
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Interesting.

945
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I love that.

946
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Yeah.

947
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Boy, I'm going to check that out.

948
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
So bitmessage.ch for the... I'm going to go, let's go look at that right now.

949
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Yeah, maybe show notes that sucker too.

950
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Yeah, I will.

951
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
That sounds really cool.

952
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
We also got just like tons of people like, hey, how's it going?

953
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I'm trying out bit message.

954
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,000
That's cool.

955
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Just write me back so I know it works.

956
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
So I do.

957
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
I try to at least, because I don't want them to think it doesn't work.

958
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Well, I'm going to open up one.

959
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So here was a bit message we got in at 1.48 PM today.

960
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
It says, hello Chris and Matt.

961
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
In your last show, you've been very busy complaining about Canonical's Ubuntu Edge IndieGoGo campaign

962
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
and I have two things to say about that.

963
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Number one, I have another theory that why the campaign failed.

964
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
There could be the possibility the Canonical set the goal at 32 million on purpose so it

965
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
doesn't succeed because they may not really be willing to take their own phone, to make

966
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
their own phone at all.

967
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I think they just did this campaign to get public attention and the attention of mobile

968
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
service providers out there so they could get software delivered at all.

969
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Number two, I really don't want you to turn the Linux action show into the Ubuntu Edge

970
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
show.

971
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Maybe you could focus a bit less on Ubuntu Edge.

972
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Well, it's funny.

973
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Why would you be writing that in at the end of the campaign?

974
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Obviously, the campaign's over.

975
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
It ran for 30 days.

976
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
So we covered during its run and now it's done.

977
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
But all you write is at the end of it and say don't cover it anymore.

978
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's over.

979
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
It's over so we won't be covering it.

980
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I think he was afraid that we might have additional afterthoughts.

981
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
You mean like we're doing right now?

982
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Yeah.

983
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Well, that's why we have this show.

984
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It allows us to not have to loop it into an entire another last.

985
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Exactly.

986
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Exactly.

987
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Yeah.

988
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Now, as far as his point, honestly, that would make whoever is in charge of this stuff brilliant,

989
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
whoever comes up with these schemes.

990
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Now, that being said, boy, I don't know.

991
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That's a pretty big stretch but it would be an interesting point.

992
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Max is not the first person to make this suggestion.

993
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I have also seen that this was memory.

994
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I mean, I have watched somebody I know make one embarrassing public disaster of a situation after another

995
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
and yet the PR only seems to continue on.

996
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I mean, there never seems to be a negative cost to it.

997
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
So I have sort of come around to the potential that perhaps all PR is good PR.

998
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
So maybe he's – I mean, Shuttleworth has to be crazy like a fox.

999
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And do you remember all those Macs we saw in the promo video?

1000
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I mean, remember how they had – I had all the drawings on them.

1001
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I mean, they were really working on it.

1002
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
So I don't know if that's true or not.

1003
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Yeah, because that to me isn't brilliant.

1004
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And so it's kind of a wash to where if this was done – and this is – I've been part of similar things in the past.

1005
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:27,000
So if that's what he was describing and that's why I say if he did, it was brilliant because I've been a part of that sort of stuff and that is really brilliant.

1006
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It wasn't my idea. It was somebody else's.

1007
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
But point being, I don't think that they have the wherewithal to actually put that together at this point.

1008
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I think that it's Shuttleworth's way or the highway.

1009
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And I don't mean that with derogatory statement.

1010
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I mean that that's – he's the lead vision for the company and the direction he wants to go is the direction they're going to go.

1011
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And I don't think that's something he would come up with on his own.

1012
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
You know what would have been awesome?

1013
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I don't think so.

1014
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I think what might have maybe made a bit of a difference is long time ago,

1015
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:00,000
one of the things that kind of put Ubuntu on the path of legitimacy is Shuttleworth like escrowed some funds for the project.

1016
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Like here's money that I have dedicated to the project.

1017
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Do you remember this?

1018
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I do remember this.

1019
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
And it was much more transparent and visible back then.

1020
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Yeah.

1021
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:19,000
If there was something like that that's like here is a very public display of Canonical's ongoing commitment to making a very, very good desktop.

1022
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Here it is. Here's an escrow account.

1023
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I have funded this division of Canonical.

1024
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,000
They will operate as if they were – like they are just their own division.

1025
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,000
They can continue to work their asses off while we focus on mobile.

1026
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
And they'll focus on that and we'll meet up in the middle.

1027
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
And here's the thing.

1028
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And maybe that's exactly how it's structured and maybe not.

1029
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Don't know.

1030
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Well, that's the whole point of this.

1031
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:52,000
They're always talking about transparency but I've yet to see the podcast shows about the latest stuff they're working on that is not – that they can talk about of course.

1032
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I want to see more behind the scenes stuff.

1033
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I want to see these guys using their own product for God's sakes.

1034
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I mean I don't really ever see that.

1035
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I see a lot of Macs but I don't see a lot of Ubuntu usage.

1036
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
And I want to see more of that in their transparency approach.

1037
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I want to see a podcast.

1038
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I want to see – not just audio but I want to see video.

1039
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I want to see actual footage of them using their stuff, brainstorming.

1040
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Bouncing ideas, shooting down ideas, accepting ideas.

1041
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I want to actually feel like I'm part of that experience.

1042
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Bring that to me.

1043
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
That's what I want.

1044
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Yeah, it is a good opportunity.

1045
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,000
They could be the – this is going to sound so corny when I say it but if you give it some thought, maybe it's not so corny.

1046
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
They could be the social company.

1047
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
They could be the social operating system company.

1048
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I don't mean make a bunch of Twitter integration into Ubuntu.

1049
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:42,000
What I mean is they could – they're lean and scrappy enough that they could be utilizing –

1050
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
well, I mean they do utilize G Plus and YouTube quite a bit but I –

1051
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
They talk at you.

1052
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
It's not effective.

1053
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Yeah, exactly.

1054
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Exactly.

1055
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
It really isn't.

1056
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Yeah.

1057
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
All right.

1058
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Well, let's get off – I'm really getting sick of talking about Canon.

1059
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Me too.

1060
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
So if you've been burned out on it, I feel like I'm spent.

1061
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So I think we're done.

1062
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
We're right there with you.

1063
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
All right.

1064
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
So one last email I just want to cover because it's kind of positive.

1065
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
The bright future of Linux servers came in via bit message.

1066
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
We got a lot of emails too.

1067
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
This is crazy, Matt.

1068
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Maybe next week we will only do emails.

1069
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I don't know.

1070
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
That's probably a good way to kind of clean out some of the logs, right?

1071
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It's too fun though.

1072
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
We're just having too much fun.

1073
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Yeah.

1074
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,000
And, you know, we can spread it out too.

1075
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,000
That's true.

1076
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
That's true.

1077
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
We got a long haul ahead of us.

1078
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
All right.

1079
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Mike B here says – he's a new supporter of Unfiltered by the way which we appreciate

1080
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
that, Mike.

1081
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
He says he's currently got a Xeon E3 server at home.

1082
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,000
He runs ZOL which is RAID Z2 as Alan would say.

1083
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
All that breaks down to is eight two-terabyte Western Digital Red drives.

1084
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
So he's got eight two-terabyte web drives.

1085
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Web drives.

1086
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Two-terabyte web drives.

1087
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Sixteen gigabytes of RAM and he's running Ubuntu 12.04.

1088
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Server host – it's like a NAS, a BitTorrent, Usenet, SickBeard, SpotWeb, SabNZB.

1089
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Awesome.

1090
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Nice.

1091
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Nice.

1092
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Mumble server, an IRC server, NGINX.

1093
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Dude's got it loaded, right?

1094
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Fuck me up.

1095
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I know.

1096
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
That's awesome.

1097
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
He says he's been looking to try to migrate his data off of Google.

1098
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
He doesn't like getting tied into that ecosystem.

1099
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
He says he's worried about data leakage.

1100
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
But he says crawling away seems really difficult.

1101
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Therefore, I've been looking to set up a mail server implementation with OpenVPN and SSH

1102
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
and give some replacements.

1103
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
One thing I've been unsatisfied about is the lack of isolation I have on the server.

1104
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Several of the apps I run are straight off of the Git repos and everything is executed

1105
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
at the same user space.

1106
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Per your mention of Docker on last episode a few weeks ago, I've begun to move my applications

1107
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
into their own containers.

1108
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I feel the data security on a VPS is an issue that isn't mentioned enough.

1109
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Like the old saying goes, if someone has physical access to all your servers, all bets are off.

1110
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
That's true.

1111
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I do agree.

1112
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
It kind of depends, I suppose, how the VPS works.

1113
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Like if it's a Zen level or KVM VPS, you know, where you are in your own isolated KVM machine,

1114
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I'm a little less worried about that.

1115
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:58,000
If it's user space applications that are simply running as a mat user, Chris user type VPS,

1116
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
that I definitely worry about a lot.

1117
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
That would be a concern, sure.

1118
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
That's interesting.

1119
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
He goes on to talk a little bit more about Docker.

1120
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Michael Dominic from Coderadio is currently working on a project and he's investigating

1121
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
the use of Docker.

1122
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Remember we covered Docker?

1123
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
We had that photo with the rainbow.

1124
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I do.

1125
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Oh, yes.

1126
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
That was great.

1127
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Docker is huge, he says.

1128
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
It isn't touted enough as removing the barriers of application packaging.

1129
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I can choose per container targets to target the best stream of packages, updates for that

1130
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
particular app.

1131
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
It's OS agnostic, yum, deb, tar, gz, pacman, whatever.

1132
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It doesn't matter.

1133
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:37,000
What he's saying here is you could be on Fedora 18 and I could be on my latest greatest arch

1134
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,320
and I could package up bit message and put it in a Docker container and send it over

1135
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:45,760
to you and you could deploy that Docker container and run it just fine on your machine because

1136
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:51,880
all of the dependencies, all of the executables, the arch environment would exist in that Docker

1137
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,440
container to the extent they are different from your machine.

1138
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,440
That would be fantastic.

1139
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,360
It could be a really cool way to deploy software.

1140
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,840
I'd say I can't see a better way.

1141
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,840
That sounds awesome.

1142
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:07,280
And everything is contained within that security zone, too.

1143
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,280
So he says, sorry to frustrate Alan, but he thinks that the Linux future looks brighter

1144
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:16,800
than BSD and ZFS being enterprise ready and working on Linux is just a win-win for Linux.

1145
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,960
So all in all, he says keep up the great work on Jupyter broadcasting.

1146
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:20,960
Thanks, Mike.

1147
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:21,960
Yeah.

1148
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,960
It's good stuff.

1149
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,400
I disagree somewhat.

1150
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:30,760
I think that BSD and Linux cater to different needs, different folks, they just cater differently.

1151
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,040
So I can't say one's brighter than the other.

1152
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,320
I definitely could not say that.

1153
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,680
I think they're both very bright, though.

1154
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:38,600
And I may or may not say that there could be a BSD podcast in the near future.

1155
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,600
I don't know.

1156
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,220
Who knows?

1157
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,360
How could somebody know that?

1158
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,360
Who would know that?

1159
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,800
Who would possibly have knowledge of that kind of thing coming?

1160
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:48,800
I imagine.

1161
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,800
I mean, the speculation alone.

1162
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,800
I know.

1163
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,160
The speculation could just get ridiculous.

1164
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,680
And if there were people that the community loved that were going to be on the show on

1165
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,560
a regular basis, that would be really outlandish.

1166
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,000
And I don't know where people are getting that from, Matt.

1167
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Anarchy.

1168
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,200
I'm a little incensed.

1169
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,200
People are just making...

1170
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:05,200
What?

1171
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,200
What did Alan say in the chat room?

1172
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,200
What did Alan say in the chat room?

1173
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,200
Oh.

1174
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,600
Well, I don't know who this Alan guy is.

1175
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,920
I don't know who you guys are talking about.

1176
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:11,920
Alan who?

1177
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:12,920
Not familiar with Alan.

1178
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,920
Not familiar.

1179
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,920
Don't know any Alan.

1180
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:15,920
All right.

1181
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,520
So I put the story of my KDE troubles in the show notes.

1182
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,220
If people are curious of the process I went through and the packages I updated and how

1183
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:23,400
I fixed it in case you have that same problem, you can just copy my commands if you want.

1184
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,680
Just be careful.

1185
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,840
I claim no warranty.

1186
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:30,840
I also put links to the email gateway for BitMessage, Olex thoughts on our Ubuntu Edge

1187
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,360
coverage, the kids can't use computers and why that should worry you, article Matt mentioned,

1188
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:37,340
as well as the BitMessage email gateway.

1189
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,280
And I also want to give a special mention to that Wiki page.

1190
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,600
People are starting to work on it right now, which is awesome.

1191
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,440
We'll be talking about more if you didn't know, which I doubt at this point.

1192
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:49,960
But we created a Wiki entry over at linuxactionshow.reddit.com and we are trying to get the community

1193
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,360
to come together on really flushing out all of the different options and solutions for

1194
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,240
rolling your own email system, you know, taking your email back onto your land or putting

1195
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:02,020
it on a VPS, whatever is best for your situation, whatever that might be.

1196
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:05,560
And how to do that, what software is available, what things have people tried, what worked

1197
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:09,160
best, what didn't work, what do people need to know about DNS wise, what do people need

1198
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,400
to know about spam filter, all that kind of stuff.

1199
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:16,240
We want to make a living document repository of this kind of thing so that way as it comes

1200
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:21,960
up, which I for some reason suspect it will more and more, we have a resource to point

1201
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,160
people towards, something that is up to date and current.

1202
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:28,840
Oh, I'm excited about it because really I've looked at other attempts and they never really

1203
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,840
hit the mark.

1204
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,700
They're always missing massive components or things you need to know.

1205
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,280
And the way ours is shaping up, I'm really excited about the prospect of it.

1206
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,080
I'm looking forward to running it myself.

1207
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,080
Yeah.

1208
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,080
Yeah.

1209
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:43,680
I haven't really picked a domain name yet that I'm going to use for my home, but the

1210
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:47,160
wife and I have been kicking around a few ideas, so I'm going to use our Linux 249.

1211
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,640
I'm going to pick up a dot com.

1212
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,280
I'm going to get, you know, so just, I'm just going to start fresh.

1213
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,680
I'm going to give it out to some people, the email address.

1214
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,040
I'll probably let it slip on the show on accident.

1215
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,040
That's fine.

1216
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,040
That's fine.

1217
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,040
Whatever.

1218
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:03,360
But like right now, my quote unquote personal email account, my Gmail, it's a mess.

1219
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,360
It's decimated, Matt.

1220
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,360
It's decimated.

1221
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,360
Oh, I'm sure.

1222
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,360
I'm sure.

1223
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,480
And then my business email gets all the show emails.

1224
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,720
So like that's decimated, Matt, it's decimated.

1225
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,720
It's decimated.

1226
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,560
And I try and keep mine pretty carefully quiet.

1227
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:18,080
I have a contact page I hand out and some people have my personal and it's fine, but

1228
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,560
I don't, I try, I try to keep it under control cause I can still manage it right now.

1229
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:26,160
So well, I thankfully, uh, early on G plus had this little thing or buzz had this little

1230
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:30,560
thing that, uh, just like release my email address to the public.

1231
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,560
So everybody had it.

1232
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,960
I was like, yeah, I'm done with that.

1233
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,960
That was your problem.

1234
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,480
You, you, you participated in buzz.

1235
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:36,480
I was buzzless.

1236
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,480
Yeah, I did.

1237
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,480
I did.

1238
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,040
Uh, so if you want to go over to the Wiki, it's linked right now.

1239
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,720
I'll, you know what, I'm going to link it in the show notes too, but it'll also be linked

1240
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,600
at the top of the Linux action show subreddit.

1241
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,600
It's a Wiki.

1242
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,600
So you go into the self.

1243
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,960
In fact, I'll link right to the self hosted email section.

1244
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,080
You go in there and just start working.

1245
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,980
You create the page and then you link it just like you would on a regular Wiki.

1246
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:54,060
One little thing that's different.

1247
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:58,080
I love it, but it's probably going to be weird for somebody who's used to using like a Wikipedia

1248
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,080
or something.

1249
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,240
It uses Markdown for the formatting Markdown's awesome.

1250
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:04,360
Um, we use it for all of our show notes.

1251
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:08,180
So they actually, the really kind of nice thing about, uh, the Wiki that we're creating

1252
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:15,480
over there is I can literally go in and edit a post and copy line by line the Markdown

1253
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,680
and paste it like we needed like a reference for our show notes and I can paste it directly

1254
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:22,600
into the show notes and it will be formatted perfectly for the, for the post.

1255
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:25,280
Oh, that makes for a nice smooth transition going back and forth.

1256
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,680
So it's a little wonky maybe if you're new to Markdown, but for the production purposes

1257
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,440
of the show, it's actually extremely convenient.

1258
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:33,920
So I figured since we already have a good community over on the Linux action show subreddit,

1259
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,680
that was a good spot to toss it.

1260
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:38,400
I wasn't sure where I was thinking, it wasn't sure where to put it at first, but that just

1261
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,880
seemed like a good spot for it to go.

1262
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,520
So we'll have that link too in the show notes.

1263
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,520
Definitely.

1264
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,880
Well, and if you're new to the Markdown thing, just Google around it.

1265
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,880
Once you get used to the syntax, it's really not that bad.

1266
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,880
Yeah.

1267
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,620
And there's some really good, um, online Markdown preview utility.

1268
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:53,080
So you can, you can experiment like in one pane.

1269
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:58,340
It's if you search Markdown online preview or something like that, preview online, uh,

1270
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:59,860
one pane is the Markdown code.

1271
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:04,460
One pane is the HTML code and you can in real time tweak your Markdown and see how it formats

1272
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:05,460
in HTML.

1273
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,460
It's a nice JavaScript.

1274
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:07,460
Don't need to load any software.

1275
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:08,460
Wham bam.

1276
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:09,460
Thank you, ma'am.

1277
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:13,860
Well, uh, Matt, I think we'll leave it at that today, but we're going to maybe hang

1278
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:16,000
out a little bit with the guys on mumble after the show.

1279
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Yeah.

1280
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,220
It's not all, it's not, we're not all done, but we'll, we'll, we'll wrap up the recording.

1281
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:21,600
Thank you guys for joining us today, Matt.

1282
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,600
Thank you for joining me.

1283
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,600
Don't forget Tuesday.

1284
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,600
Next week.

1285
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,600
Tuesday.

1286
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:26,600
Got the note.

1287
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,600
Got the calendar.

1288
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,600
We're all set.

1289
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:29,600
We're moving.

1290
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:30,600
I'll update the Jupiter broadcasting calendar right off where we get off the air.

1291
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,900
Emails, Linux action show, Jupiter broadcasting.com or send us a bit message.

1292
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:33,900
Start a thread in that subreddit.

1293
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:39,300
We're in there all the time, linuxactionshow.reddit.com Hey, thanks for joining us for Linux unplugged.

1294
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:42,780
We'll see you right back here on Monday or Tuesday actually, and we'll see you on Sunday

1295
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:43,780
for the big show.

1296
01:13:43,780 --> 01:14:04,300
Thanks everybody.
