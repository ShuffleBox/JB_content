WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.320
Noah's just outside this studio right now,

00:03.320 --> 00:06.440
setting up, he's soldering, he's wiring,

00:06.440 --> 00:10.960
he's unboxing our whole Linux Fest display, really.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.980
It's more than a production this year,

00:12.980 --> 00:14.760
it's a bit of a display, really.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.320
The FedEx guy is like, I got some packages,

00:17.320 --> 00:18.880
and he comes up with the first cart load,

00:18.880 --> 00:19.720
and I'm like, okay, thanks.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.860
He's like, oh no, oh no, no, no, no.

00:21.860 --> 00:22.700
I have a lot more.

00:22.700 --> 00:23.520
I'll be back.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.720
So many more.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.320
So we just stand there holding the dogs,

00:26.320 --> 00:27.680
and we're like, well, we can't let the dogs out,

00:27.680 --> 00:29.720
but this guy's taking like three trips back and forth,

00:29.720 --> 00:30.560
and now the-

00:30.560 --> 00:31.400
Fills up the whole kitchen.

00:31.400 --> 00:32.720
The whole kitchen got full of box,

00:32.720 --> 00:34.120
and now the living room's full of boxes.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.520
We got gear everywhere.

00:35.520 --> 00:36.360
But I don't know.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.680
I kind of think this year, more so than any year,

00:38.680 --> 00:41.120
the booth itself could be an exhibit.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.040
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.240
Really high-end Linux production equipment,

00:44.240 --> 00:46.320
like the highest-end stuff we've ever done.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.440
Noah did some last-minute flying around

00:48.440 --> 00:53.440
to secure a really high-end production digital mixer for us.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.920
That's why you're soldering wires,

00:54.920 --> 00:56.040
because it turns out,

00:56.040 --> 00:57.920
when you go into a certain category of hardware,

00:57.920 --> 01:00.800
they don't just make average consumer connections anymore.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.360
You've got to custom build everything.

01:02.360 --> 01:03.600
Yeah, if you look at an XLR cable,

01:03.600 --> 01:05.840
you figure there's three conductors.

01:05.840 --> 01:06.960
The wire's that big, right?

01:06.960 --> 01:08.840
And we put this big old honkin' connector on it.

01:08.840 --> 01:09.680
Why?

01:11.800 --> 01:12.720
In a live environment,

01:12.720 --> 01:14.040
where you're unplugging and plugging things in,

01:14.040 --> 01:14.920
you need that flexibility.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.240
But in a studio environment,

01:16.240 --> 01:17.480
you're really putting the microphone in,

01:17.480 --> 01:19.280
and it's gonna stay there for 15 years.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.200
And so we're gonna put XLR cables in,

01:21.200 --> 01:23.640
so that we can unplug them and plug them into the Linux.

01:23.640 --> 01:24.640
It'll be beautiful.

01:24.640 --> 01:25.840
And then we're gonna move it to Linux Fest.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.220
We're gonna have a heck of a show.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.060
All right, Bramberry,

01:28.060 --> 01:28.880
you come back in later on the show

01:28.880 --> 01:29.720
and you chat with us

01:29.720 --> 01:30.540
as we talk about more of what we're doing.

01:30.540 --> 01:31.960
But you go out there and keep on boxing.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.220
This is Linux Unplugged,

01:34.220 --> 01:35.720
episode 246,

01:35.720 --> 01:38.280
for April 24th, 2018.

01:38.280 --> 01:43.280
Welcome to Linux Unplugged,

01:50.760 --> 01:52.560
your wiggly Linux talk show

01:52.560 --> 01:54.360
that's flying a little blind this week,

01:54.360 --> 01:55.400
a little raw,

01:55.400 --> 01:57.440
and there's a lot of plasma all around me.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.280
My name is Chris.

01:58.280 --> 01:59.100
My name is Wes.

01:59.100 --> 02:02.120
It has been a re-install fest, Mr. Wes.

02:02.120 --> 02:02.960
That almost,

02:02.960 --> 02:04.560
that looks beautiful around here.

02:04.560 --> 02:05.720
So fresh, so clean.

02:05.720 --> 02:06.920
You know, it's been really nice.

02:06.920 --> 02:07.760
It's been a lot of fun.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.520
We'll talk about our adventures in Kubuntu 18.04

02:10.520 --> 02:12.640
coming up a little bit here in this here show.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.900
But we have so many other things to get into.

02:14.900 --> 02:18.400
As always, we have ourselves some community news.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.280
We'll get through all of that in the beginning,

02:20.280 --> 02:23.000
including an open source modular router

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
that's being crowdfunded.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.240
The Linux terminal coming to Chrome OS.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.960
The state of Thunderbolt in Fedora 28.

02:29.960 --> 02:34.960
A reevaluation and an update on Ubuntu's beta milestones.

02:35.080 --> 02:38.220
And then very quietly recently,

02:38.220 --> 02:42.040
Microsoft disbanded the Windows division.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.400
There's no more Windows division at Microsoft anymore.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.360
Let that, let that sink in for a second.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.480
They've been merged into a larger group

02:49.480 --> 02:53.120
that's responsible for just general consumer devices.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.800
The biggest empire inside Microsoft is gone.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.320
So we'll talk about what that could mean

02:57.320 --> 02:59.160
for their Linux future.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.680
Then I've got a couple of app picks for you.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.360
A great update on that big no memory leak

03:03.360 --> 03:05.560
and the fallout of the conversation

03:05.560 --> 03:08.000
and the discussion in the community that took place

03:08.000 --> 03:09.480
because of that memory leak.

03:09.480 --> 03:14.000
And then after I talk about my new favorite backup program,

03:14.000 --> 03:15.920
we'll reveal the big change that we've been making

03:15.920 --> 03:19.120
in the studio, the new investment in Linux

03:19.120 --> 03:19.960
that we're making,

03:19.960 --> 03:21.880
and discuss some Linux Fest Northwest plans coming up.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.080
Ooh, I'm excited.

03:23.080 --> 03:24.120
Which is just this weekend.

03:24.120 --> 03:24.960
Can you believe it?

03:24.960 --> 03:25.800
No, that's crazy.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.000
Oh!

03:27.000 --> 03:28.640
Yeah, that's gonna be a big deal.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.600
But before we go any further,

03:29.600 --> 03:31.320
we've got to bring in our virtual log.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.440
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.280
What's up?

03:34.280 --> 03:35.960
Hey, to you.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.360
Oh, man, that was a thick introduction.

03:38.360 --> 03:39.200
I liked it.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.020
That was nice.

03:40.020 --> 03:44.720
So let's start with something that is really, really,

03:44.720 --> 03:46.520
really, really potential for,

03:46.520 --> 03:49.640
has a lot of potential for fixing a big problem

03:49.640 --> 03:51.000
in the consumer market.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.560
One of the things that just drives me crazy

03:52.560 --> 03:54.360
is the state of routers.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.840
Home routers, those cheap routers

03:55.840 --> 03:57.480
that people are buying from electronic stores

03:57.480 --> 03:58.720
or from Amazon or wherever,

03:58.720 --> 04:01.220
they throw them in and then three years later,

04:01.220 --> 04:03.360
they never, they haven't given a second thought.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.680
They've missed 16 updates

04:05.680 --> 04:07.760
and they're just little vulnerability boxes

04:07.760 --> 04:11.080
that are waiting for some sort of attack,

04:11.080 --> 04:12.160
some sort of attack,

04:12.160 --> 04:15.120
either just monitoring or some sort of DNS attack.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.400
They're just such a sad state.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.640
And they're really the early canary in the coal mine

04:19.640 --> 04:20.600
for Internet of Things.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.440
Very much so.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.940
And we blew it.

04:22.940 --> 04:24.520
And we still haven't really solved it.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.280
And there's tons of good open source projects.

04:26.280 --> 04:27.360
We've talked about MonoWall,

04:27.360 --> 04:29.040
we've talked about PFSense,

04:29.040 --> 04:32.240
but there hasn't been like this consumer focused,

04:32.240 --> 04:34.040
all in one solution that us geeks

04:34.040 --> 04:35.120
could really wrap our head around.

04:35.120 --> 04:38.080
Right, anything else is like a cloud managed service

04:38.080 --> 04:39.800
that manages the updates for you.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.640
No good.

04:40.640 --> 04:41.460
And while that may work,

04:41.460 --> 04:43.000
it doesn't really fit our features.

04:43.000 --> 04:43.820
That's not, I mean,

04:43.820 --> 04:45.280
no one might prefer a cloud connected router.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.120
You sure would.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.580
But not me, no, no way.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.680
So this has left a spot in the market

04:50.680 --> 04:54.080
for somebody to fulfill an Enter Turris Mox.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.320
I think I might be saying that right,

04:55.320 --> 04:56.600
but who really knows.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.160
It is a modular open source router

04:59.160 --> 05:00.720
that is currently being crowdfunded.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.440
And the goal of the campaign

05:02.440 --> 05:06.520
is to make a modular that has three individual components.

05:06.520 --> 05:07.840
This is where the modular part comes in,

05:07.840 --> 05:09.240
depending on what you need.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.800
They want to give the user the ability

05:10.800 --> 05:12.360
to put together a custom router

05:12.360 --> 05:14.400
that fits your network's requirements.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.420
And they say it's probably the first router

05:16.420 --> 05:18.520
that's configurable and easy as a sandwich.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.280
You just choose the parts you actually want

05:20.280 --> 05:23.120
and you assemble it like you would a sandwich.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.800
To make it happen, there's five modules available,

05:25.800 --> 05:28.400
but really you could just focus on a couple of them.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.100
And they hired a fancy voiceover guy to do it,

05:31.100 --> 05:32.900
so I'll have him do it instead of me.

05:34.060 --> 05:38.120
Your perfect router can consist of these modules.

05:38.120 --> 05:43.120
Basic, Extension, Ethernet, and SFP.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.660
The basic module is powered by a passive-cooled

05:46.660 --> 05:48.660
Marvell Armada processor,

05:48.660 --> 05:53.660
has a micro SD card slot, USB 3, and a gigabit WAN port.

05:53.660 --> 05:55.780
With the Wi-Fi card alone,

05:55.780 --> 05:58.300
it can serve as a pocket-ready router,

05:58.300 --> 06:00.820
or you can connect it to your router,

06:00.820 --> 06:03.540
for example, Omnia, as an access point.

06:03.540 --> 06:05.820
If you need faster wireless speed,

06:05.820 --> 06:08.100
just connect the Extension module

06:08.100 --> 06:13.100
with a five gigahertz Wi-Fi card connected to the MPCI Express slot.

06:13.100 --> 06:18.100
Or, you can switch the Wi-Fi card with an SSD to make a NAS.

06:18.100 --> 06:22.100
Or, you can insert a SIM card to the slot,

06:22.100 --> 06:24.100
connect an LTE modem,

06:24.100 --> 06:29.100
and use this module as a backup connectivity solution.

06:29.100 --> 06:34.100
You can also connect the Ethernet module with four gigabit ports.

06:34.100 --> 06:37.100
Hoorah! Man, tell you what.

06:37.100 --> 06:40.100
That is the worst voice-over ever.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.100
Got me all fired up!

06:41.100 --> 06:43.100
Yeah, Taurus.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.100
Didn't make you want to buy, huh Wimpy?

06:45.100 --> 06:49.100
They could have paid Popey to do that for twice as much and got better value.

06:49.100 --> 06:52.100
They might have been able to hire the Mycroft device and got a better value,

06:52.100 --> 06:55.100
I'm not sure, but the idea is pretty neat.

06:55.100 --> 06:58.100
You've got this router that has the different components depending on what you need.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.100
If you need lots of gigabit, it can even do it.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.100
And then they have software features,

07:02.100 --> 07:06.100
like an open VPN server, an SSH honeypot, parental controls.

07:06.100 --> 07:10.100
The kind of neat thing is the honeypot is set up to be involved in a research project,

07:10.100 --> 07:14.100
so it is involved in a wider honeypot collection metric thing.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.100
That's kind of neat.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.100
So, it's a Taurus Mox.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.100
Neat idea.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.100
I don't think they sold us though, did they?

07:21.100 --> 07:22.100
They didn't sell us.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.100
How is their funding?

07:24.100 --> 07:26.100
This is their second round.

07:26.100 --> 07:27.100
They've had success.

07:27.100 --> 07:30.100
Wes, did you fund them?

07:30.100 --> 07:32.100
Wes, did you fund the last one?

07:32.100 --> 07:33.100
Because you got an email about this.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.100
No, I think I just subscribed for updates.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.100
So, I was clearly interested in the past.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.100
Yeah, it's a neat idea.

07:39.100 --> 07:42.100
Does anybody know what chip they have from Marvell?

07:42.100 --> 07:50.100
Because from what I understand, Marvell's best chips are our mother's latest chips,

07:50.100 --> 07:57.100
and those are based on A72 Cortex-R, which are vulnerable by meltdown and stuff.

07:57.100 --> 08:03.100
I'm sorry, I was already not buying much of their premise,

08:03.100 --> 08:06.100
because I think it's duplication of efforts of Freedombox.

08:06.100 --> 08:10.100
I want somebody to come in and make a device that looks good,

08:10.100 --> 08:12.100
that fits just the general consumer,

08:12.100 --> 08:15.100
but I believe that there's a project for that already,

08:15.100 --> 08:19.100
and if they could actually bring a consumer perspective to that project,

08:19.100 --> 08:21.100
I would be very glad to support it.

08:21.100 --> 08:25.100
But also, the stuff that I'm hearing doesn't make it much better,

08:25.100 --> 08:32.100
and most of Marvell's chips are Cortex-A72 and A53, which are both vulnerable.

08:32.100 --> 08:38.100
It says here it's based on the Marvell Armada 3720 with a 1.2 GHz dual-core.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.100
Yes, that's a Cortex-A53.

08:40.100 --> 08:43.100
I'm just checking it right now, and that's vulnerable.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.100
Oh, good meltdown.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.100
Because better security, great, awesome.

08:47.100 --> 08:52.100
Also, it'll be using Kernel 4.14 LTS, which is the same as OpenWRT 18.5,

08:52.100 --> 08:55.100
which it is based on, it's Czech Republic,

08:55.100 --> 08:58.100
Chaotix says in the chat room is where they're from.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.100
So there you go.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.100
You know, I like the idea.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.100
I actually like it.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.100
I'm not going to back it myself.

09:04.100 --> 09:07.100
For me, I've sort of moved on to larger hardware for this kind of job.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.100
Yeah, I have as well.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.100
Neat idea though.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.100
And the pricing is not bad.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.100
Early bird is $130.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.100
It's bad.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.100
Routers are becoming expensive.

09:16.100 --> 09:20.100
Routers were always cheap and most of the times even offered.

09:20.100 --> 09:26.100
Yes, I'm not advocating for the offers that ISPs usually provide,

09:26.100 --> 09:28.100
but they've always been cheap.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.100
Out of a sudden, they're becoming these expensive things,

09:30.100 --> 09:33.100
like they fix your problems and they never fix your problems.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.100
Yeah.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.100
Also, do you need your router to be a NAS?

09:36.100 --> 09:38.100
Like I don't ever want my router to be a NAS.

09:38.100 --> 09:42.100
By the way, Dart, I would like to issue a correction.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.100
Good routers, those are expensive.

09:45.100 --> 09:48.100
The cheap ones are like don't really have much security

09:48.100 --> 09:52.100
and don't really have updates just to give you a little bit of a contortion.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.100
I understand.

09:53.100 --> 09:56.100
What I mean is it should never be something too expensive.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.100
Look at the hardware that they bring inside.

09:58.100 --> 10:01.100
Most of the times what they bring is a benefit.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.100
The higher range ones are not really on chips,

10:04.100 --> 10:09.100
but rather on design of antennas, on ways of actually capturing signal,

10:09.100 --> 10:11.100
which is what a router is supposed to do really well.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.100
Of course, when you're talking at a high bandwidth,

10:14.100 --> 10:16.100
that has an impact on the chips you're having there

10:16.100 --> 10:18.100
and, of course, increases the price.

10:18.100 --> 10:21.100
But oftentimes when you're going to the $500 range,

10:21.100 --> 10:25.100
what you really mean is you should be paying a hundred-something dollar range.

10:25.100 --> 10:27.100
I do like that it's open source.

10:27.100 --> 10:32.100
So there is a premium as a particular type of consumer that I'd be willing to pay,

10:32.100 --> 10:35.100
but it's not a premium that I think the average consumer would be willing to pay.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.100
Absolutely not.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.100
It's doing well, Funny Wise.

10:37.100 --> 10:41.100
We'll have a link in the show notes if you guys want to check it out after the show.

10:41.100 --> 10:44.100
But this is actually the story I was going to start the show with, this next one.

10:44.100 --> 10:47.100
And it's going to be one of these revelations

10:47.100 --> 10:50.100
that I think is going to be received in two different ways in the community.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.100
Oh good, more Linux and open source users.

10:52.100 --> 10:56.100
And the other one is, oh my God, Chrome OS is going to crush Linux.

10:56.100 --> 10:59.100
Sort of like the subsystem for Linux on Windows has been.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.100
This is happening.

11:00.100 --> 11:03.100
It just seems nothing but absolute at this point.

11:03.100 --> 11:07.100
There is additional screenshots that have surfaced indicating that a terminal app

11:07.100 --> 11:11.100
that gives you access to the Bash shell on Chromebooks is shipping soon.

11:11.100 --> 11:15.100
It started back in February when there was some code base that revealed

11:15.100 --> 11:20.100
that Chrome OS would have some capability of running Linux applications using a container,

11:20.100 --> 11:24.100
which we talked about a little bit, but there wasn't a lot to go into.

11:24.100 --> 11:28.100
Now it appears that additional builds have come out

11:28.100 --> 11:32.100
and more evidence of this feature has appeared in the Chrome OS dev channel.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.100
And several Reddit users did some digging

11:35.100 --> 11:38.100
and they found a new terminal app that's been added to the app drawer.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.100
And when you click on it, it explains the feature.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.100
It comes up with a dialogue, and the dialogue says,

11:43.100 --> 11:44.100
you can now develop on your Chromebook.

11:44.100 --> 11:48.100
You can run your favorite native apps and command line tools seamlessly and securely.

11:48.100 --> 11:52.100
Installing the terminal will download 200 megabytes of data.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.100
Probably a container, huh?

11:53.100 --> 11:55.100
Wow, interesting.

11:55.100 --> 11:58.100
And then when you try to do it, it fails at this point because it's not actually done.

11:58.100 --> 12:00.100
Look at that little logo, fits right in.

12:00.100 --> 12:03.100
What do you think about this, Wes? Terminals on Chromebooks.

12:03.100 --> 12:09.100
I mean, that would go a long way to leave the needs I have just to get more work done.

12:09.100 --> 12:13.100
Sure, web browsing is fine, but if I could get even just SSH into some servers very easily,

12:13.100 --> 12:15.100
that would be maybe just a sweet spot.

12:15.100 --> 12:18.100
Not for me still, but I think a lot of people could use it.

12:18.100 --> 12:22.100
Google is learning that they need to actually attract developers,

12:22.100 --> 12:24.100
and that's the tool to attract developers.

12:24.100 --> 12:29.100
I think it's a little bit too late and not really a threat for Linux.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.100
Yeah, I don't think so either.

12:30.100 --> 12:34.100
In fact, I think more so, I think about my son who's been issued a Chromebook,

12:34.100 --> 12:38.100
and I think my daughter gets issued one next year as part of hers.

12:38.100 --> 12:43.100
And they're his school curriculum, and potentially now my son will have access to a terminal.

12:43.100 --> 12:46.100
That seems like it has way more upsides than it does downsides.

12:46.100 --> 12:51.100
And I'm sure Google is going to implement it in a way that he can't go like RM-RF root or something.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.100
So we'll see that.

12:52.100 --> 12:57.100
Maybe, maybe it won't matter because we'll all switch to Bollock.

12:57.100 --> 12:58.100
I don't know how you actually say it.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.100
It's Block.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.100
Oh, what's your mouth at?

13:01.100 --> 13:04.100
Bellock, what do you think, guys?

13:04.100 --> 13:06.100
What is it, Wes? B-L-L-O-C?

13:06.100 --> 13:07.100
No, there's no A.

13:07.100 --> 13:08.100
No A.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.100
It's Bollock or Bollock or what? Block?

13:10.100 --> 13:12.100
Everybody's switching to Bollocks.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.100
Yeah, it's all Bollocks, my friends.

13:14.100 --> 13:17.100
No, I think Block, like a block of wood maybe.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.100
Oh, yeah, a block of wood.

13:19.100 --> 13:22.100
It's a phone that is focused on simplicity.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.100
Simplicity, it's easy for me to say.

13:24.100 --> 13:30.100
They say a plain, minimalistic smartphone that combines a power-saving operating system

13:30.100 --> 13:36.100
with efficient hardware and an easy-to-use messaging platform, and it's monochrome.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.100
The whole thing is monochrome.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.100
Nobody's buying it.

13:40.100 --> 13:41.100
I don't know.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.100
Quite a sharp look.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.100
That's my prediction.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.100
Another messaging platform.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.100
Well, it uses WhatsApp.

13:47.100 --> 13:52.100
It has Uber and Facebook Messenger, and it has Google Maps.

13:52.100 --> 13:57.100
So they're bringing somehow, they're bringing a small set of applications.

13:57.100 --> 14:01.100
Instead of multiple distractions, we aim for focus.

14:01.100 --> 14:05.100
Instead of fragmented conversations, we strive for continuity and fluidity.

14:05.100 --> 14:09.100
Booking your flight, checking weather, or ordering on Uber,

14:09.100 --> 14:12.100
it all happens in one place, the root.

14:12.100 --> 14:15.100
So they have this UI system that they've designed,

14:15.100 --> 14:19.100
which looks a lot like Windows 8 tiles, only maybe a little more minimal and clean,

14:19.100 --> 14:22.100
and the whole UI is built around monochrome, black and white.

14:22.100 --> 14:24.100
You mean it looks like Fushio OS?

14:24.100 --> 14:25.100
Kind of, yeah.

14:25.100 --> 14:29.100
I would say more Windows phone possibly.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.100
Yeah, like a combo.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.100
It's a combo of them.

14:31.100 --> 14:34.100
It's a combo and then black and white, and like if you were going to design today,

14:34.100 --> 14:37.100
it's got 4 gigs of RAM, which seems like a ton for a device like this.

14:37.100 --> 14:41.100
It's got an octa-core 2 gigahertz ARM A53 Cortex processor.

14:41.100 --> 14:44.100
It's got a 3000 milliamp battery.

14:44.100 --> 14:48.100
It's got a camera in it, a decent Sony 13 megapixel camera in it.

14:48.100 --> 14:49.100
USB-C.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.100
Yep, USB-C.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.100
It's got a headphone jack.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.100
It's got fast charging.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.100
Let me see if I got it right.

14:53.100 --> 14:57.100
So we took years and years of developing excellent cameras

14:57.100 --> 14:59.100
to then see them in a monochrome screen.

14:59.100 --> 15:03.100
Yes, yes, and years and years of all these mobile applications

15:03.100 --> 15:05.100
to just have them on a simple black and white screen.

15:05.100 --> 15:08.100
I don't know if it's going to work, but I'll tell you, I know what the market,

15:08.100 --> 15:09.100
I just know it.

15:09.100 --> 15:12.100
They're going for people that kind of want a feature phone,

15:12.100 --> 15:14.100
but they don't want to go that far back in time.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.100
They still want to be able to book an Uber,

15:16.100 --> 15:18.100
and they still want to be able to use Google Maps.

15:18.100 --> 15:21.100
And so they need something that isn't full-fledged smartphone

15:21.100 --> 15:24.100
because they've determined that's the evil thing in their life

15:24.100 --> 15:25.100
that's wrecking their life.

15:25.100 --> 15:28.100
And so if they purge the smartphone from life,

15:28.100 --> 15:31.100
but they get something that's still capable of booking a ride

15:31.100 --> 15:36.100
and nav, then they're not a crackpot that's trying like a pager

15:36.100 --> 15:38.100
or something in 2018.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.100
So I think there is a market for it.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.100
It can't be $350.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.100
It can't be some boutique thing.

15:43.100 --> 15:46.100
It'd have to be sold at scale, at carriers.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.100
It'd probably have to be something from a Samsung or a Nokia,

15:48.100 --> 15:50.100
in my personal opinion.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.100
Yeah, that's 360 euros, so it's like 440.

15:52.100 --> 15:53.100
Oh, okay.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.100
That's even more, yeah.

15:54.100 --> 15:57.100
And Doug and Doug and Doug, I didn't see a lot of references

15:57.100 --> 16:00.100
to Linux or Android in there, but it must be Android.

16:00.100 --> 16:03.100
I didn't see which frequencies bands it supported either.

16:03.100 --> 16:06.100
It's a weird device, but it's also, it's one of those devices

16:06.100 --> 16:08.100
that if you had this device, it would stand out.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.100
It sure would.

16:09.100 --> 16:12.100
I would say if somebody really wants something like it,

16:12.100 --> 16:14.100
they would get a Yota phone.

16:14.100 --> 16:15.100
Is that the one with the e-ink?

16:15.100 --> 16:19.100
Yes, it has a back of e-ink and the front is an actual screen,

16:19.100 --> 16:21.100
but you can actually just get away with using the e-ink.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.100
Yeah, that would be cool.

16:23.100 --> 16:27.100
Yeah, the difference between the Yota phone and this phone

16:27.100 --> 16:33.100
is that the Yota phone's display is very low, very low in frame rate.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.100
Yeah, but that's the thing.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.100
If you said it is because it's Russian, I mean,

16:36.100 --> 16:41.100
if the person really wants to get away from the modern smartphone

16:41.100 --> 16:46.100
and have this as an excuse to, I'm cutting down on this,

16:46.100 --> 16:50.100
yeah, the only downside would be that this phone is kind of Russian.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.100
It's the only real thing.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.100
Minimac, you make a good point that they might be overshooting

16:54.100 --> 16:57.100
with that screen, not because it's monochrome, but because of the size, huh?

16:57.100 --> 17:00.100
Yeah, if you're a really feature phone user,

17:00.100 --> 17:04.100
you don't want a 5.5-inch phone, you want a smaller one.

17:04.100 --> 17:10.100
I'm looking for a small 5-inch phone again, but you don't find some.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.100
Only Sony does want some.

17:12.100 --> 17:14.100
Yeah, I've looked at that Sony one a couple of times and went,

17:14.100 --> 17:15.100
oh, that'd be sweet.

17:15.100 --> 17:20.100
I had a Sony Ericsson back in the day that could fit in my coin pocket,

17:20.100 --> 17:24.100
just this tiny little phone, a little GSM feature phone,

17:24.100 --> 17:25.100
the neatest little thing.

17:25.100 --> 17:26.100
Lasts for days.

17:26.100 --> 17:27.100
Yeah.

17:27.100 --> 17:29.100
It doesn't have to do much except make phone calls.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.100
Yeah, yeah.

17:30.100 --> 17:33.100
All right, well, let's take a moment right here and thank Ting then

17:33.100 --> 17:34.100
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.100
This seems like a natural spot.

17:36.100 --> 17:39.100
Go to, you ready for this, linux.ting.com.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.100
You get to put Linux in there, linux.ting.com,

17:41.100 --> 17:45.100
and you'll get a $25 service credit or $25 off a device.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.100
It's smarter than unlimited mobile.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.100
It's paid for what you use.

17:48.100 --> 17:51.100
So right now, Wes, myself, and Noah are sitting here at the studio,

17:51.100 --> 17:53.100
and all of our phones are on Wi-Fi.

17:53.100 --> 17:57.100
Every push notification we get, every telegram we get,

17:57.100 --> 17:59.100
it all is coming in over Wi-Fi.

17:59.100 --> 18:03.100
And I think that's why when you're a geek and you kind of understand

18:03.100 --> 18:06.100
that there's different networks and some are like you own them

18:06.100 --> 18:07.100
and you can use as much data as you want,

18:07.100 --> 18:10.100
and some are like rate limited by a service provider or monitored,

18:10.100 --> 18:12.100
if you just understand that concept,

18:12.100 --> 18:16.100
that's the only hack you need to get a ton of value out of Ting.

18:16.100 --> 18:19.100
It's paid for what you use, just a fair price for how much you talk,

18:19.100 --> 18:22.100
text, and data you use, and you can rock that.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.100
I download my podcast, I pin my music on Wi-Fi,

18:24.100 --> 18:26.100
and that covers most of it.

18:26.100 --> 18:28.100
I text message over telegram, now Bob's my uncle.

18:28.100 --> 18:32.100
They have nationwide coverage, and like I said, CDMA and GSM,

18:32.100 --> 18:35.100
so you can bring a device or you can just pick one up from Ting directly

18:35.100 --> 18:37.100
and choose whatever works best in your area.

18:37.100 --> 18:40.100
And when you go to linux.ting.com, you get $25 off a device.

18:40.100 --> 18:43.100
If you bring one, they'll give you $25 in service credit.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.100
And if you ever get stuck, you ever have a question,

18:45.100 --> 18:47.100
the best customer service in the industry,

18:47.100 --> 18:49.100
I wouldn't say that unless it was true.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.100
It is absolutely 100% true.

18:51.100 --> 18:54.100
They have the best customer service in the industry,

18:54.100 --> 18:56.100
and you can just get a taste of it when you call in.

18:56.100 --> 18:59.100
linux.ting.com, that's where you go to get started.

18:59.100 --> 19:03.100
And speaking of those feature phones, they got a good smattering of them.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.100
They have around $60, you can get a couple of great ones,

19:06.100 --> 19:11.100
and then they have one as low as $49, the Anzatel Go Flip.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.100
It's got a monochrome, speaking of monochrome,

19:13.100 --> 19:16.100
it's got a monochrome screen on the front so you can get a clock and stuff like that,

19:16.100 --> 19:18.100
and you open up, it's got a full color screen.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.100
Even these have like cameras and stuff.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.100
Yeah, totally.

19:21.100 --> 19:24.100
It's like even then, the reason why that camera is nice on these feature phones

19:24.100 --> 19:26.100
is for like insurance situations or whatnot.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.100
Just a casual picture doesn't need to be great, just a quick document.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.100
Come on, you know what you're taking pictures of,

19:30.100 --> 19:32.100
you don't need it to be that high resolution.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.100
You know what I'm saying.

19:33.100 --> 19:39.100
linux.ting.com, a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring this year Unplugged program,

19:39.100 --> 19:41.100
and thanks to Ting and thanks to you guys,

19:41.100 --> 19:44.100
not only for sponsoring to Ting, but for you guys out there,

19:44.100 --> 19:46.100
going out there and using linux.ting.com to keep us going.

19:46.100 --> 19:49.100
246 episodes.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.100
Keep on going over at Fedora too.

19:51.100 --> 19:55.100
Fedora 28 is just around the corner,

19:55.100 --> 19:58.100
and one of the cool features in Fedora 28

19:58.100 --> 20:01.100
is how badass their Thunderbolt 3 support is.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.100
It really all starts upstream with Bolt.

20:04.100 --> 20:05.100
Bolt's been getting development for a while.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.100
We've covered it once before on the show.

20:07.100 --> 20:11.100
Bolt is a project that's been moved now over to freedesktop.org

20:11.100 --> 20:14.100
that works with the security models of Thunderbolt 3,

20:14.100 --> 20:19.100
a D-Bus API, and in this case, Gnome and some kernel changes

20:19.100 --> 20:23.100
to give users control over Thunderbolt 3's permissiveness.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.100
So you hook up a device.

20:24.100 --> 20:27.100
If it's Thunderbolt 3, it's essentially on your PCI bus.

20:27.100 --> 20:30.100
It's like you just put a card inside your case.

20:30.100 --> 20:34.100
And so that gives you access to things like memory contents

20:34.100 --> 20:37.100
that are on the PCI bus.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.100
You might not want that, especially if you're in a more

20:39.100 --> 20:42.100
secured environment or there's other people around.

20:42.100 --> 20:45.100
You may want to be able to say, no, don't give that access

20:45.100 --> 20:48.100
to all of the things like my keys that are being stored in RAM right now.

20:48.100 --> 20:52.100
So there's bits now that have been added in Gnome Shell

20:52.100 --> 20:57.100
and backported to the Gnome Shell that's shipping in Fedora 28,

20:57.100 --> 21:00.100
which is part of why Fedora 28 has a little bit extra sauce here.

21:00.100 --> 21:02.100
A little extra magic.

21:02.100 --> 21:06.100
Gnome 3.3.0 will have these changes upstream.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.100
I suppose anybody can probably backport them.

21:08.100 --> 21:13.100
But it comes with a new panel in Gnome that allows you to manage all of this.

21:13.100 --> 21:17.100
And it gives you features like being able to temporarily disable authorization

21:17.100 --> 21:19.100
if you don't want to do anything for a little bit.

21:19.100 --> 21:23.100
In technical terms, without authorization on the PCIe tunnels,

21:23.100 --> 21:26.100
no new tunnels are allowed to be created on the bus.

21:26.100 --> 21:28.100
And then you get a failure mode.

21:28.100 --> 21:33.100
And the Thunderbolt port, yeah, it's hard for me to say, Wes,

21:33.100 --> 21:39.100
will still function as USB and DisplayPort, but it will not act as PCIe.

21:39.100 --> 21:41.100
Oh, wow. This is sophisticated.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.100
Yeah, you'll get options in Gnome, and you set those.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.100
It'll support firmware updates.

21:46.100 --> 21:49.100
If your screen is locked, if you're away, if your machine's asleep,

21:49.100 --> 21:51.100
it'll automatically default to disable.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.100
Oh, perfect. Some smart stuff like that.

21:53.100 --> 21:57.100
Yeah, so that's coming in Fedora 28 is some really good Thunderbolt support.

21:57.100 --> 22:02.100
Some quality desktop operating system level feature right here.

22:02.100 --> 22:04.100
I don't think you even get, you don't get that crap on the Mac.

22:04.100 --> 22:08.100
My other favorite part is that they're calling the activity indicator the cable snake.

22:08.100 --> 22:12.100
That is good. Good catch. That is a good part of it. You're right.

22:12.100 --> 22:16.100
Cable snake. I don't have a lot of Thunderbolt 3 devices to test,

22:16.100 --> 22:20.100
but I bet Wimpy, actually, you probably have some of the most in the room

22:20.100 --> 22:22.100
because all your eGPU shenanigans have been over Thunderbolt.

22:22.100 --> 22:25.100
Have you thought about the security model stuff with this?

22:25.100 --> 22:27.100
Is this something you're concerned about when it comes to Thunderbolt?

22:27.100 --> 22:32.100
Well, by and large, I've been using NUX in the house,

22:32.100 --> 22:37.100
so I've just been turning on the open it all up mode.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.100
I've got a couple of laptops that I've used,

22:39.100 --> 22:41.100
and I've been toggling the BIOS settings,

22:41.100 --> 22:43.100
and I've been going out and about with those.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.100
And I have been tracking this project,

22:45.100 --> 22:50.100
and it's something that I want to look at during the Ubuntu 18.10 cycle

22:50.100 --> 22:53.100
to try and integrate, because like you say, it's a bit niche, right?

22:53.100 --> 22:57.100
You need to be somebody that's using this stuff in order to appreciate its value.

22:57.100 --> 23:00.100
So something I'm going to be looking at over the next six months.

23:00.100 --> 23:04.100
Neat. Yeah, it is something that not a lot of us have a need for yet,

23:04.100 --> 23:06.100
but I could see it coming down the road,

23:06.100 --> 23:09.100
especially if eGPUs get more and more common.

23:09.100 --> 23:13.100
I'm really kind of excited about the potential of getting a low-power laptop

23:13.100 --> 23:14.100
and then hooking up an eGPU to it.

23:14.100 --> 23:17.100
So I could see this becoming more common,

23:17.100 --> 23:19.100
but it'll probably take a little while to warm up.

23:19.100 --> 23:21.100
I can see it for compliance reasons, too.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.100
There may be things that you need to be able to prove

23:23.100 --> 23:27.100
about attaching peripherals to devices that the subsystem can support now.

23:27.100 --> 23:30.100
Yeah, I mean, enterprises have been getting their pants in the knot

23:30.100 --> 23:32.100
about USB devices for years,

23:32.100 --> 23:38.100
and this is an interface where you're basically plugging into lanes on the CPU.

23:38.100 --> 23:42.100
So it needs to be well-controlled and managed.

23:42.100 --> 23:43.100
Yeah, fair enough.

23:43.100 --> 23:46.100
All right, I might need somebody to translate a little canonicalese for me here.

23:46.100 --> 23:50.100
But a couple of weeks ago, and covered on the Ubuntu podcast,

23:50.100 --> 23:52.100
as well, was the Quigley proposal,

23:52.100 --> 23:56.100
which was a reevaluation of Ubuntu's testing milestones.

23:56.100 --> 23:58.100
And now this is where I need the translation.

23:58.100 --> 24:00.100
So Simon made the proposal, and it came on up,

24:00.100 --> 24:03.100
and we talked about it a little bit, and it sounded pretty solid.

24:03.100 --> 24:09.100
The general idea is starting from now on, there will be an opt-in milestone,

24:09.100 --> 24:11.100
or I guess that's going to be discontinued, that's what it was,

24:11.100 --> 24:16.100
and there will be testing weeks from now on, starting with the 1810 cycle.

24:16.100 --> 24:19.100
And different flavors, I believe, will just say,

24:19.100 --> 24:21.100
I'll opt-in, I'll do the testing, other flavors won't,

24:21.100 --> 24:24.100
and there will just be a period of focused testing,

24:24.100 --> 24:27.100
and this is just going to start happening with the next cycle.

24:27.100 --> 24:30.100
Is this all accurate? Anybody want to correct me on that?

24:30.100 --> 24:34.100
Okay, so I – well, Poppy, do you want to go for this, or should I?

24:34.100 --> 24:35.100
Knock yourself out.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.100
All right, I'll do it then. You can do the next one, whatever the next one is.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.100
Yeah, good.

24:42.100 --> 24:46.100
I hope it is, actually. We should make it mate and make Poppy do it.

24:46.100 --> 24:48.100
Actually, that's a really good idea.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.100
Let's do it, let's do it.

24:49.100 --> 24:51.100
If you have any suggestions, though, I need a suggestion.

24:51.100 --> 24:53.100
Hmm, I don't know.

24:53.100 --> 24:56.100
Despite his blushes and refusals, he's an expert, by the way.

24:56.100 --> 24:57.100
I believe it.

24:57.100 --> 25:01.100
So did I get my coverage of the milestones shift rate, the testing weeks?

25:01.100 --> 25:02.100
What's going on?

25:02.100 --> 25:08.100
Yeah, so we use – well, we currently do, the flavors in Ubuntu currently do,

25:08.100 --> 25:13.100
like Alpha 1, Alpha 2, Beta 1, and then at Beta 2, that's when Ubuntu steps in.

25:13.100 --> 25:16.100
We all do Beta 2. We all do RCs.

25:16.100 --> 25:20.100
So right now, Ubuntu 18.04 is two days away,

25:20.100 --> 25:24.100
so we're on our second release candidate image right now for those people

25:24.100 --> 25:28.100
that are following the QA train and testing stuff.

25:28.100 --> 25:32.100
What the flavors are going to do for 18.10, and we've all bought into this,

25:32.100 --> 25:37.100
is we're going to drop those Alpha 1s and those Alpha 2s and those Beta 1s,

25:37.100 --> 25:43.100
and as a community, those flavors are going to replace those milestone releases

25:43.100 --> 25:47.100
if this is a week that all of the Ubuntu community get behind to say,

25:47.100 --> 25:49.100
this is a week we're going to do testing.

25:49.100 --> 25:52.100
This is a week where you can go and grab the daily image

25:52.100 --> 25:56.100
for any of your favorite flavors and perform the testing,

25:56.100 --> 26:02.100
and we're going to coalesce around a week of testing as a community in the whole,

26:02.100 --> 26:07.100
rather than what we have now is silos of the flavors doing testing

26:07.100 --> 26:11.100
within their own organizations.

26:11.100 --> 26:16.100
And we're going to be replacing some of the manual testing that we've been doing

26:16.100 --> 26:20.100
with the automated testing that already happens within Ubuntu proper.

26:20.100 --> 26:25.100
So that will mean that we can focus, the flavors can focus on the new

26:25.100 --> 26:29.100
and interesting things that they're working on, rather than making sure

26:29.100 --> 26:34.100
the mechanics of installing and upgrading the distribution work.

26:34.100 --> 26:39.100
So we can move away from manually testing that stuff to just focusing on the good stuff.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.100
Now, how does this exactly go down?

26:41.100 --> 26:44.100
So Simon makes a proposal, and essentially nobody says no,

26:44.100 --> 26:48.100
and so then it just becomes the way it goes now?

26:48.100 --> 26:50.100
It wasn't out of the blue.

26:50.100 --> 26:54.100
For anyone that's in the Ubuntu developer community,

26:54.100 --> 26:59.100
Simon had had the good grace to contact us all on a one-to-one basis beforehand

26:59.100 --> 27:00.100
and sound us out.

27:00.100 --> 27:07.100
So his proposal was crafted around feedback he'd got from those one-to-one conversations.

27:07.100 --> 27:10.100
So this wasn't from left of field.

27:10.100 --> 27:16.100
This was Simon presenting an idea that everyone was already aware of

27:16.100 --> 27:18.100
and had already opted into to some extent.

27:18.100 --> 27:22.100
I guess I was more commenting on what seems to be a low level of friction

27:22.100 --> 27:26.100
to implement what is a rather significant type of testing change,

27:26.100 --> 27:27.100
which is a good thing, right?

27:27.100 --> 27:30.100
It doesn't have to go through 10 levels of council before it happens.

27:30.100 --> 27:33.100
But that was interesting to see go down.

27:33.100 --> 27:35.100
It makes sense if you discuss it ahead of time,

27:35.100 --> 27:38.100
you communicate it ahead of time to the stakeholders, quote, unquote,

27:38.100 --> 27:42.100
and they're on board, pretty safe bet it's going to sail through smoothly.

27:42.100 --> 27:46.100
And I think there's only a couple of flavors that have represented this.

27:46.100 --> 27:51.100
There's only one downside, and the downside that I see is that

27:51.100 --> 27:58.100
the only version that people are going to adopt early now will be the final beta.

27:58.100 --> 28:01.100
So Ubuntu proper and the flavors

28:01.100 --> 28:05.100
are going to have a version that's available on the same day.

28:05.100 --> 28:12.100
And that's going to make it difficult for the flavors to grab a new cycle.

28:12.100 --> 28:17.100
So traditionally, we've kind of argued the toss between us about, you know,

28:17.100 --> 28:20.100
I'm going to make a big grandstanding announcement for Alpha 2

28:20.100 --> 28:24.100
and you're going to make a big grandstanding announcement for beta one.

28:24.100 --> 28:27.100
And we know that those new cycles are clear for the flavors

28:27.100 --> 28:29.100
and those are going away now.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.100
So that's the only downside.

28:31.100 --> 28:37.100
But we've decided, by and large, we're prepared to give that up

28:37.100 --> 28:41.100
in order to work towards better testing methodology.

28:41.100 --> 28:42.100
That's interesting.

28:42.100 --> 28:43.100
Thank you for that insight.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.100
I appreciate that.

28:44.100 --> 28:50.100
And I guess, to me, I look at it as sort of it draws in the focus.

28:50.100 --> 28:52.100
That's what I loved about the proposal,

28:52.100 --> 28:55.100
is it just sort of focuses everyone's attention on a period of time.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.100
Yeah, exactly.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.100
Now, Pobie, you want to add something to this mix.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.100
Why don't you jump in?

28:59.100 --> 29:01.100
Yeah, it's something you've highlighted.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.100
The fact that Simon just brought this up on a mailing list

29:03.100 --> 29:06.100
and then it becomes law, right,

29:06.100 --> 29:09.100
is something that I think is a bit of a misconception about Ubuntu.

29:09.100 --> 29:12.100
People seem to think that canonical dictate all the decisions in Ubuntu

29:12.100 --> 29:15.100
and all the flavors and nobody has any autonomy,

29:15.100 --> 29:19.100
which is like this shows just how far from the truth that is.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.100
That anyone within the project, if they've got a good idea

29:21.100 --> 29:25.100
and they can articulate it well and they can specify what the advantages are

29:25.100 --> 29:28.100
and what the costs will be, then people will adopt it

29:28.100 --> 29:29.100
and it's the new way forward.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.100
That's exactly how Ubuntu works,

29:31.100 --> 29:35.100
is people all around the community putting in their suggestions

29:35.100 --> 29:37.100
and coming up with ideas on how to improve the project

29:37.100 --> 29:41.100
and it's not all just Mark sitting in a gold chair

29:41.100 --> 29:43.100
dictating how the project is going to be run.

29:43.100 --> 29:44.100
It's brilliant.

29:44.100 --> 29:45.100
I love it.

29:45.100 --> 29:48.100
Yeah, it's like you always say, Pobie, the proof is in the pudding.

29:48.100 --> 29:49.100
I think you've always said that.

29:49.100 --> 29:50.100
You've always said that every time.

29:50.100 --> 29:51.100
I've never said that.

29:51.100 --> 29:52.100
I literally never said that.

29:52.100 --> 29:54.100
Well, I thought I heard that.

29:54.100 --> 29:56.100
Yeah, good point though.

29:56.100 --> 29:59.100
And I guess we'll see this play out in 18.10 right now.

29:59.100 --> 30:01.100
I think we've probably spent enough on it

30:01.100 --> 30:04.100
because we should probably start focusing on 18.04 coming up

30:04.100 --> 30:05.100
because gosh knows I have.

30:05.100 --> 30:06.100
I'm excited.

30:06.100 --> 30:07.100
Gosh darn it.

30:07.100 --> 30:10.100
But I want to talk about this Microsoft story just for a moment

30:10.100 --> 30:13.100
because it's one of those where it really slipped through the cracks

30:13.100 --> 30:17.100
because the corporate speak around it is all positive.

30:17.100 --> 30:20.100
You know, so-and-so has departed from the company

30:20.100 --> 30:25.100
and we will be moving this group under this new group that we've just formed.

30:25.100 --> 30:28.100
And this new group is fantastic because it's future

30:28.100 --> 30:31.100
and future is good and the future is bright.

30:31.100 --> 30:34.100
And everything is good because future.

30:34.100 --> 30:37.100
And that's essentially the announcement that came out two weeks ago.

30:37.100 --> 30:41.100
And it's taken me a couple of weeks to process what's happened.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.100
Noah was here with me last night while I was doing the prep.

30:43.100 --> 30:46.100
I was like I will not go off of one story.

30:46.100 --> 30:47.100
I don't care if it's trajectory.

30:47.100 --> 30:48.100
I don't care.

30:48.100 --> 30:51.100
I want three additional sources that are citing this.

30:51.100 --> 30:54.100
And so we found three additional sources.

30:54.100 --> 30:57.100
We have them linked in the show notes that are citing this.

30:57.100 --> 30:59.100
Using GoogleFu to the maximum.

30:59.100 --> 31:00.100
Yeah, both of us were, yeah.

31:00.100 --> 31:03.100
The thing is it's sort of a huge, huge development.

31:03.100 --> 31:05.100
So I didn't want to come on the air

31:05.100 --> 31:07.100
and accidentally overstate what had happened

31:07.100 --> 31:10.100
because when you're digging through this corporate speak,

31:10.100 --> 31:12.100
it's early to misunderstand.

31:12.100 --> 31:15.100
But there were clues that kind of all led to this.

31:15.100 --> 31:18.100
I say maybe dots that could have been connected.

31:18.100 --> 31:21.100
The first big clue about Windows future was that

31:21.100 --> 31:24.100
Microsoft's Windows and Devices group is now called

31:24.100 --> 31:27.100
the Experience and Devices group.

31:27.100 --> 31:28.100
They've dropped the Windows thing.

31:28.100 --> 31:32.100
And it includes now Windows Office and Surface.

31:32.100 --> 31:35.100
Microsoft's Office Chief is now in charge of the division.

31:35.100 --> 31:38.100
So the guy that runs Office 365 is now in charge

31:38.100 --> 31:41.100
of the people that are developing Windows.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.100
Which that used, Windows used to control the shop.

31:44.100 --> 31:48.100
Windows and Office were really the two major fiefdoms

31:48.100 --> 31:51.100
in Microsoft that really fought.

31:51.100 --> 31:53.100
And then SQL came up.

31:53.100 --> 31:55.100
I mean, in the good old days of Microsoft,

31:55.100 --> 31:59.100
the whole company, the balance of the entire company

31:59.100 --> 32:03.100
was shifted towards Windows.

32:03.100 --> 32:06.100
And now it's being run by Office 365,

32:06.100 --> 32:08.100
which Microsoft internally just considers to be

32:08.100 --> 32:09.100
a smashing success.

32:09.100 --> 32:13.100
So Experiences instead of Windows was really the first big hint.

32:13.100 --> 32:16.100
You could see really kind of signaling from Satya Nadella.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.100
When you look at the numbers really, it's kind of obvious.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.100
If Microsoft just took their heads out of their arse

32:21.100 --> 32:24.100
and looked around, they'd see that there's 2 billion

32:24.100 --> 32:26.100
monthly active Android devices.

32:26.100 --> 32:28.100
And there's more than a billion monthly active iPhones,

32:28.100 --> 32:32.100
or Apple devices, iOS devices, all around the world.

32:32.100 --> 32:36.100
Well, Microsoft claims there's 1.5 billion Windows users total.

32:36.100 --> 32:40.100
And 600 million Windows 10 users as of November.

32:40.100 --> 32:46.100
So Windows is now a tertiary platform, really.

32:46.100 --> 32:48.100
That doesn't make it tertiary, though.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.100
So here is how I will say it does not.

32:51.100 --> 32:54.100
The customers that pay the most are the ones

32:54.100 --> 32:56.100
that are obligated to do so.

32:56.100 --> 32:58.100
And those are enterprises and governments.

32:58.100 --> 33:01.100
How many governments are using iOSX?

33:01.100 --> 33:03.100
I wouldn't look at it from the desktop perspective.

33:03.100 --> 33:05.100
In that case, you could flip that question around

33:05.100 --> 33:07.100
and you could say services.

33:07.100 --> 33:11.100
And there would be, why would they even be going to cloud services?

33:11.100 --> 33:13.100
And a lot of times it's because they're trying to address

33:13.100 --> 33:14.100
a massive mobile demand.

33:14.100 --> 33:17.100
I mean, that was a huge source of my client base

33:17.100 --> 33:20.100
towards the end of my IT career was companies scrambling

33:20.100 --> 33:24.100
to redo their services because of the demand from mobile clients.

33:24.100 --> 33:27.100
I think if you look at it, every Windows user

33:27.100 --> 33:29.100
has an Android or an iPhone.

33:29.100 --> 33:32.100
So it's just huge in terms of end user reach.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.100
And you look at companies like Uber,

33:34.100 --> 33:37.100
who are worldwide phenomenons,

33:37.100 --> 33:40.100
and they've never written a Windows app.

33:40.100 --> 33:43.100
Those haven't written necessarily an Android app

33:43.100 --> 33:45.100
or an iOSX app.

33:45.100 --> 33:47.100
You could make a point that they might be using Windows

33:47.100 --> 33:48.100
to make the Android app.

33:48.100 --> 33:50.100
So I'm not trying to discredit Windows.

33:50.100 --> 33:53.100
But my point is, if Microsoft has their head out of their arse,

33:53.100 --> 33:55.100
they've got to be seeing this.

33:55.100 --> 33:58.100
Windows isn't the biggest game in town anymore.

33:58.100 --> 34:00.100
They've got to be seeing that.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.100
Of course, you are preaching to the choir.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.100
The person in here who made the prediction

34:04.100 --> 34:06.100
Microsoft would have a Linux distribution,

34:06.100 --> 34:08.100
which they now do have.

34:08.100 --> 34:09.100
Just a moment.

34:09.100 --> 34:10.100
Yeah, you did get that.

34:10.100 --> 34:11.100
Just a moment.

34:11.100 --> 34:12.100
You got that.

34:12.100 --> 34:16.100
And not only, I will tell you that in a year and a half

34:16.100 --> 34:19.100
to maximum of two years, they will have a desktop environment

34:19.100 --> 34:21.100
that is proprietary on a Linux machine.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.100
Wow.

34:22.100 --> 34:24.100
I mean, I would have said no way last time.

34:24.100 --> 34:25.100
I want to say that now.

34:25.100 --> 34:26.100
I can't say it now.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.100
You never know.

34:27.100 --> 34:28.100
I mean, you just never know.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.100
It just makes business sense.

34:30.100 --> 34:31.100
It does.

34:31.100 --> 34:35.100
They have the subsystems, which they can now start building

34:35.100 --> 34:38.100
their own apps against the subsystems.

34:38.100 --> 34:42.100
And the devices, so they sell already Android phones.

34:42.100 --> 34:45.100
They sell Samsung S8s, by the way.

34:45.100 --> 34:49.100
So that's actually how they acquired the skill set.

34:49.100 --> 34:53.100
They bought Android apps businesses so that they would

34:53.100 --> 34:56.100
get the skills without indicating to the market

34:56.100 --> 34:58.100
that they would be ditching Windows.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.100
That's how they wanted to get the developers.

35:00.100 --> 35:03.100
They got the developers by acquisition, not by hiring.

35:03.100 --> 35:08.100
Because you can't lie on a hiring job advertisement

35:08.100 --> 35:10.100
of what the person's going to do.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.100
Otherwise, you don't hire the right person.

35:12.100 --> 35:16.100
Don't you think, though, that it is sort of like the biggest

35:16.100 --> 35:21.100
anti-climactic ending to the Windows empire?

35:21.100 --> 35:23.100
No, it's actually strategic.

35:23.100 --> 35:24.100
Oh, sure it is.

35:24.100 --> 35:28.100
So I don't think it's even anti-climatic because what's

35:28.100 --> 35:31.100
going to happen is you get the Windows experience.

35:31.100 --> 35:34.100
Like the thing that Microsoft always gives you, which is

35:34.100 --> 35:36.100
continuity with partners.

35:36.100 --> 35:39.100
This is the thing that Windows and Microsoft have always

35:39.100 --> 35:40.100
guaranteed to you.

35:40.100 --> 35:43.100
Yes, it was not the perfect operating system.

35:43.100 --> 35:44.100
It never was.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.100
It never intended to be.

35:46.100 --> 35:49.100
It was never the unified experience.

35:49.100 --> 35:50.100
But it always worked.

35:50.100 --> 35:53.100
And when you got a peripheral from a partner,

35:53.100 --> 35:54.100
it always worked.

35:54.100 --> 35:56.100
Yeah, you know what I would do if I was Microsoft?

35:56.100 --> 35:59.100
Is I would look back, you know, with the same glasses that

35:59.100 --> 36:01.100
they're looking at the rest of the market and going,

36:01.100 --> 36:03.100
God, look at all these iOS and Android devices.

36:03.100 --> 36:05.100
I'd look back and go, well, so what is the market for

36:05.100 --> 36:06.100
Windows?

36:06.100 --> 36:09.100
Because when you've got a billion users and 30 years of

36:09.100 --> 36:11.100
user base, you're not going away.

36:11.100 --> 36:13.100
You know, just like IBM.

36:13.100 --> 36:14.100
You're going to be here forever.

36:14.100 --> 36:15.100
It will go away.

36:15.100 --> 36:16.100
It will go away.

36:16.100 --> 36:17.100
Well, I mean, eventually.

36:17.100 --> 36:21.100
But what could they do right now, say in the next 10 years,

36:21.100 --> 36:23.100
to make Windows super relevant?

36:23.100 --> 36:25.100
And I would look at the technical and development

36:25.100 --> 36:27.100
market, the people building applications and services.

36:27.100 --> 36:29.100
Like, that seems like where Windows goes.

36:29.100 --> 36:31.100
Too slow, too little for Microsoft.

36:31.100 --> 36:32.100
See?

36:32.100 --> 36:33.100
Yeah.

36:33.100 --> 36:35.100
See, my prediction here is the following.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.100
Okay.

36:36.100 --> 36:41.100
Google has invested in making their assistant the best as

36:41.100 --> 36:42.100
possible.

36:42.100 --> 36:45.100
And they've captivated people into using for alarms and

36:45.100 --> 36:46.100
things like that.

36:46.100 --> 36:47.100
So it's already useful, right?

36:47.100 --> 36:48.100
Yeah.

36:48.100 --> 36:51.100
Microsoft has been trying to put the assistant mostly on

36:51.100 --> 36:53.100
professional fields first.

36:53.100 --> 36:57.100
For example, Skype for Business includes live translation.

36:57.100 --> 36:59.100
Things like that in China, you know?

36:59.100 --> 37:02.100
So things like that are the most powerful to integrate.

37:02.100 --> 37:06.100
For example, you also look into Cortana.

37:06.100 --> 37:09.100
Cortana is not intended to just do calendars and stuff.

37:09.100 --> 37:12.100
It's mostly for you actually to try to find files,

37:12.100 --> 37:14.100
to run applications.

37:14.100 --> 37:18.100
It's kind of more of an assistant design strategy.

37:18.100 --> 37:22.100
And that means that if they get it right over time,

37:22.100 --> 37:25.100
Microsoft has the capacity to, oh,

37:25.100 --> 37:29.100
we sell you an Android phone, which includes Cortana.

37:29.100 --> 37:31.100
And by the way, we sync it with a desktop.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.100
And really, when Samsung comes out with a phone,

37:33.100 --> 37:36.100
which is like about one to two years different distance

37:36.100 --> 37:38.100
from now, which is going to be full glass,

37:38.100 --> 37:40.100
there's not going to be buttons on it,

37:40.100 --> 37:42.100
the assistant makes full sense.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.100
It's just the phone that the assistant shows you some

37:44.100 --> 37:45.100
stuff.

37:45.100 --> 37:46.100
Sure, yeah.

37:46.100 --> 37:47.100
And you talk to it.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.100
I agree.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.100
They would love that.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.100
That would be really big for them.

37:50.100 --> 37:51.100
Okay.

37:51.100 --> 37:52.100
Thanks for getting here because you tagged me.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.100
River, you still think there's a spot for Windows to be

37:54.100 --> 37:55.100
pretty relevant, don't you?

37:55.100 --> 37:56.100
Not really.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.100
No, I can tell you the situation that I have right now

37:58.100 --> 38:00.100
at work that's happening.

38:00.100 --> 38:04.100
I manage probably 40 or 50, maybe 60 Windows desktops.

38:04.100 --> 38:07.100
And I can tell you 99.9% of the applications that they

38:07.100 --> 38:09.100
are running are open and free source applications.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.100
Really?

38:10.100 --> 38:13.100
And we're just, I'm on a precipice right now of

38:13.100 --> 38:15.100
developing a Linux desktop for them.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.100
And they can just take away the entire overhead of

38:17.100 --> 38:19.100
running Windows desktops.

38:19.100 --> 38:21.100
There's just almost no necessity for it.

38:21.100 --> 38:22.100
Yeah.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.100
The problem I'm facing now is a cultural one.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.100
They don't want to switch.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.100
They don't want to get from my cold dead hands.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.100
They really don't want to get away from that.

38:30.100 --> 38:33.100
But I am in a fortunate position where the entire

38:33.100 --> 38:35.100
backend infrastructure is Solaris and Linux.

38:35.100 --> 38:38.100
So it's really going to dovetail in quite nicely if

38:38.100 --> 38:40.100
I can make it happen.

38:40.100 --> 38:43.100
And the other thing really to think about is most users

38:43.100 --> 38:45.100
don't care what's running underneath.

38:45.100 --> 38:47.100
They just want to get into the apps.

38:47.100 --> 38:50.100
You guys are really kind of clarifying the strategy here.

38:50.100 --> 38:53.100
I think it's the right one for Microsoft to be making.

38:53.100 --> 38:55.100
And maybe they should have even done it a decade

38:55.100 --> 38:56.100
sooner, you could argue.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.100
No.

38:57.100 --> 38:58.100
No?

38:58.100 --> 38:59.100
You don't think so?

38:59.100 --> 39:00.100
No, I don't think so.

39:00.100 --> 39:02.100
If they had done it a decade sooner, they would not

39:02.100 --> 39:04.100
get the support of the people.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.100
I agree with that.

39:05.100 --> 39:08.100
I think they screwed up enough now that people are

39:08.100 --> 39:11.100
like, yes, yes, do not spend money doing this stuff.

39:11.100 --> 39:12.100
Yeah.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.100
Just keep on doing what's already tested.

39:14.100 --> 39:16.100
And the staff inside Microsoft know it too.

39:16.100 --> 39:18.100
They can see it.

39:18.100 --> 39:21.100
And they see Satya Nadella making the choices to,

39:21.100 --> 39:23.100
I'm not trying to put this all on Satya, but they see

39:23.100 --> 39:25.100
the company shifting away from Windows.

39:25.100 --> 39:26.100
They see it.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.100
There's got to be internal support.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.100
Because the stock price, okay, so I looked at the

39:30.100 --> 39:32.100
stock price, since they started talking like this

39:32.100 --> 39:35.100
years ago, and the more they've talked like this,

39:35.100 --> 39:37.100
the more shifts they made, the more they've de-emphasized

39:37.100 --> 39:40.100
Windows, their stock price has continued to climb.

39:40.100 --> 39:41.100
The staff see that.

39:41.100 --> 39:43.100
The management sees that.

39:43.100 --> 39:44.100
The market sees that.

39:44.100 --> 39:45.100
I think it makes sense, right?

39:45.100 --> 39:48.100
They seem more like the other big tech companies now, right?

39:48.100 --> 39:50.100
I think of them, it's almost like Google had bought

39:50.100 --> 39:53.100
Windows from Microsoft and running it that way.

39:53.100 --> 39:56.100
Except they're doing it with the Microsoft way and Azure, right?

39:56.100 --> 39:58.100
Going to even say something bolder.

39:58.100 --> 40:00.100
Microsoft will save Linux from Apple.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.100
Whoa.

40:01.100 --> 40:02.100
Okay.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.100
This is reality.

40:04.100 --> 40:05.100
So look at this.

40:05.100 --> 40:10.100
Apple has got the most of normal users, okay,

40:10.100 --> 40:13.100
with their devices, and now they're getting education,

40:13.100 --> 40:15.100
which is how you hook up.

40:15.100 --> 40:17.100
It's the old Microsoft strategy.

40:17.100 --> 40:22.100
First, those is free, and then forever you pay for it, right?

40:22.100 --> 40:26.100
So now they've got education, and they've also got governments.

40:26.100 --> 40:29.100
Most governments tend to use Apple devices,

40:29.100 --> 40:31.100
because it's simple to use.

40:31.100 --> 40:34.100
They've now managed to make a singular programming language,

40:34.100 --> 40:37.100
which actually has attracted a large sum of developers

40:37.100 --> 40:40.100
that would otherwise not work in Apple devices,

40:40.100 --> 40:43.100
and made it all super appealing.

40:43.100 --> 40:48.100
They have made the good headlines in the privacy sector.

40:48.100 --> 40:51.100
Even though we know better technologically,

40:51.100 --> 40:55.100
we still know that most of the common Joe picks up that

40:55.100 --> 40:58.100
and says, oh, Apple sticks up to us.

40:58.100 --> 41:01.100
And ultimately, Apple is running the game.

41:01.100 --> 41:04.100
Google has the best services by far,

41:04.100 --> 41:09.100
but Apple is the platform where those services run the most part.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.100
So it becomes really hard.

41:11.100 --> 41:14.100
Yeah, the industry does seem to follow their lead in a lot of areas.

41:14.100 --> 41:18.100
So if Microsoft really picks up on this desktop world of Linux,

41:18.100 --> 41:23.100
then yes, Microsoft will be the most popular Linux distribution on the planet.

41:23.100 --> 41:26.100
I'm going to need to have a few drinks

41:26.100 --> 41:29.100
before I can even think more about that one.

41:29.100 --> 41:31.100
Some prophetic stuff right there.

41:31.100 --> 41:34.100
And their money is going to be made on the cloud, and they know it,

41:34.100 --> 41:36.100
so it's not a problem,

41:36.100 --> 41:41.100
because hey, they can play the cool guy that has everything open source,

41:41.100 --> 41:43.100
and everything is nice.

41:43.100 --> 41:46.100
But ultimately, you buy an Xbox and runs your Linux games,

41:46.100 --> 41:48.100
because that's your Steam machine, by the way.

41:48.100 --> 41:49.100
It's an Xbox.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.100
No, you're crazy now. You're crazy now.

41:51.100 --> 41:53.100
Come on. Come on.

41:53.100 --> 41:55.100
I'm telling you, like, a ten-year plan, right?

41:55.100 --> 41:57.100
So in two years, they'll have the desktop,

41:57.100 --> 41:59.100
and I already can tell you this.

41:59.100 --> 42:03.100
And in about ten years, I expect this to be your normal thing.

42:03.100 --> 42:06.100
It's like, when you look at Tron,

42:06.100 --> 42:09.100
when you look at Tron, that there is this company that has one OS

42:09.100 --> 42:11.100
that everybody uses, that's Microsoft,

42:11.100 --> 42:13.100
but that OS underneath will be Linux.

42:13.100 --> 42:17.100
Yeah, they do like that, and you could also see their IoT platform,

42:17.100 --> 42:19.100
Azure Sphere, what starts out very humble,

42:19.100 --> 42:22.100
scaling up to a very high-performance system ten years down the road.

42:22.100 --> 42:25.100
I mean, ten years, there's going to be a lot of different types

42:25.100 --> 42:26.100
of CPU developments and memory.

42:26.100 --> 42:32.100
They've got the head-on collision with AR.

42:32.100 --> 42:37.100
They've built the most sophisticated AR display system

42:37.100 --> 42:40.100
for actual professional world.

42:40.100 --> 42:43.100
They are not even kidding about making entertainment pieces.

42:43.100 --> 42:45.100
And guess what?

42:45.100 --> 42:49.100
When you go to your doctor, your doctor is going to use HoloLens,

42:49.100 --> 42:52.100
not Oculus stuff, not Vivo stuff,

42:52.100 --> 42:55.100
not iPhone stuff, not Apple stuff.

42:55.100 --> 42:58.100
It's going to be HoloLens, because that's the one that works right now,

42:58.100 --> 43:00.100
and they've been using surgery right now.

43:00.100 --> 43:03.100
I never hear anyone talking about HoloLens.

43:03.100 --> 43:07.100
I hear people talking about Vive and Oculus.

43:07.100 --> 43:11.100
So where's this shift to HoloLens going to come from?

43:11.100 --> 43:14.100
Okay, I can tell you already, for example,

43:14.100 --> 43:21.100
Portugal, Spain, Finland have already done government contracts

43:21.100 --> 43:25.100
where HoloLens is being deployed in hospitals for remote surgery.

43:25.100 --> 43:26.100
Whoa.

43:26.100 --> 43:28.100
Well, the idea of a dedicated piece of hardware

43:28.100 --> 43:31.100
that comes from a company like Microsoft,

43:31.100 --> 43:32.100
that seems like that'd be more appealing

43:32.100 --> 43:34.100
than a doctor holding up an iPhone to a patient.

43:34.100 --> 43:36.100
So I definitely get that.

43:36.100 --> 43:38.100
I don't know if we'll see.

43:38.100 --> 43:41.100
That'd be remarkable, remarkable developments.

43:41.100 --> 43:42.100
There are a couple of things,

43:42.100 --> 43:44.100
a couple of threads that you've touched on

43:44.100 --> 43:47.100
that do seem very Microsoft.

43:47.100 --> 43:49.100
Like their ability to sell to business channels

43:49.100 --> 43:50.100
for a HoloLens-type device

43:50.100 --> 43:51.100
is something that Microsoft's going to do better at

43:51.100 --> 43:54.100
than anybody else making a device like that.

43:54.100 --> 43:56.100
And the fact that they do really want one OS

43:56.100 --> 43:57.100
that they can run everywhere.

43:57.100 --> 43:59.100
I think that's in the DNA of the company,

43:59.100 --> 44:01.100
but just Windows is no longer that OS,

44:01.100 --> 44:04.100
and so they're in an awkward teenage transition phase right now.

44:04.100 --> 44:07.100
They lost every knowledge that they had about Windows

44:07.100 --> 44:08.100
that was relevant.

44:08.100 --> 44:12.100
They hired React OS guys to help them understand Windows.

44:12.100 --> 44:15.100
It no longer makes sense to do that.

44:15.100 --> 44:19.100
They just bought a few Android apps companies.

44:19.100 --> 44:22.100
People with knowledge about the Linux operating system,

44:22.100 --> 44:25.100
and now they hope to keep it on because it's open source

44:25.100 --> 44:28.100
and it's easy to go and read and learn about it.

44:28.100 --> 44:30.100
It's making my head spin thinking about this.

44:30.100 --> 44:32.100
You mentioned React OS for a second.

44:32.100 --> 44:34.100
I gave it a go for Linux Action News 50.

44:34.100 --> 44:36.100
I gave a little mini review on Linux Action.

44:36.100 --> 44:37.100
Wow.

44:37.100 --> 44:40.100
I'll just short TLDR is

44:40.100 --> 44:43.100
I'm going to be following that project with some interest.

44:43.100 --> 44:45.100
It's like peak Windows is how I describe it.

44:45.100 --> 44:46.100
Peak Windows.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.100
Hitting that sweet spot right for you.

44:48.100 --> 44:50.100
It's a little tricky to get up and running,

44:50.100 --> 44:53.100
but they really have something there.

44:53.100 --> 44:55.100
I wrote it off as a joke, so I never tried it,

44:55.100 --> 44:58.100
because I thought the only reason I would ever use Windows

44:58.100 --> 45:01.100
would be to run applications that are proprietary

45:01.100 --> 45:02.100
that I can't run on Linux.

45:02.100 --> 45:04.100
Why would I want to run React OS,

45:04.100 --> 45:07.100
which would probably be like trying to use Wine?

45:07.100 --> 45:09.100
I'll tell you what.

45:09.100 --> 45:11.100
That was a mistaken assumption on my part.

45:11.100 --> 45:15.100
This is an amazing, impressive, open source operating system

45:15.100 --> 45:16.100
they've built.

45:16.100 --> 45:23.100
I forgot how the Windows 98 SE 2000 era UI

45:23.100 --> 45:26.100
is just hard cold efficient.

45:26.100 --> 45:27.100
It's hard cold efficient.

45:27.100 --> 45:28.100
Pretty simple.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.100
Just straight up.

45:29.100 --> 45:31.100
You're very familiar with it already.

45:31.100 --> 45:32.100
That sounds familiar.

45:32.100 --> 45:33.100
Yeah, it does.

45:33.100 --> 45:34.100
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

45:34.100 --> 45:35.100
Oh, yeah.

45:35.100 --> 45:38.100
I was supposed to throw a mate hardball at Popey.

45:38.100 --> 45:40.100
Popey, could you tell me specifically

45:40.100 --> 45:42.100
what's the major stuff I'm going to be missing

45:42.100 --> 45:45.100
if I install Ubuntu Mate 1804 Minimal Edition?

45:45.100 --> 45:49.100
The Minimal Edition for Ubuntu proper

45:49.100 --> 45:52.100
stripped out only a few applications like LibreOffice,

45:52.100 --> 45:55.100
but the Ubuntu Mate developers went a bit further

45:55.100 --> 45:58.100
and stripped out pretty much everything.

45:58.100 --> 46:00.100
There's very little left for you.

46:00.100 --> 46:02.100
For example, you might think,

46:02.100 --> 46:04.100
oh, I'm losing stuff because I'm ripping it out,

46:04.100 --> 46:06.100
but actually it makes a great base to start from

46:06.100 --> 46:09.100
because if you install Ubuntu Mate Minimal,

46:09.100 --> 46:12.100
then you could maybe make it auto login,

46:12.100 --> 46:13.100
install Steam, and there you go.

46:13.100 --> 46:14.100
You've got your Steam box.

46:14.100 --> 46:15.100
What do you say?

46:15.100 --> 46:16.100
What do you think?

46:16.100 --> 46:18.100
I'm welling up with pride right now.

46:18.100 --> 46:19.100
You did so good.

46:19.100 --> 46:20.100
Yeah, you did.

46:20.100 --> 46:21.100
You know what?

46:21.100 --> 46:22.100
I'm going to give you...

46:22.100 --> 46:23.100
How do I know that?

46:23.100 --> 46:24.100
I did that yesterday.

46:24.100 --> 46:25.100
Nice.

46:25.100 --> 46:26.100
I'm going to give you an RMS.

46:26.100 --> 46:27.100
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

46:27.100 --> 46:28.100
You earned that one.

46:28.100 --> 46:29.100
You earned that one.

46:29.100 --> 46:30.100
That was good.

46:30.100 --> 46:31.100
All right.

46:31.100 --> 46:33.100
Well, as we get down the show a little bit,

46:33.100 --> 46:35.100
I'll talk about my experimentations recently

46:35.100 --> 46:37.100
with a minimal install and loving it,

46:37.100 --> 46:39.100
but I'll tell you more in detail in a moment.

46:39.100 --> 46:42.100
But let's talk about DigitalOcean for just a moment here.

46:42.100 --> 46:44.100
dio.co slash unplug.

46:44.100 --> 46:46.100
DigitalOcean is simplicity at scale.

46:46.100 --> 46:48.100
You can get started in less than 55 seconds.

46:48.100 --> 46:50.100
You spin up a rig on DigitalOcean

46:50.100 --> 46:52.100
and get off to the races.

46:52.100 --> 46:54.100
If you want to use a base system and build it from there,

46:54.100 --> 46:56.100
you can, or an entire application stack.

46:56.100 --> 46:58.100
You want a simple Markdown-based blog,

46:58.100 --> 47:01.100
WordPress is too much, deploy Ghost in one click.

47:01.100 --> 47:03.100
You decided it's time to use your own GitLab?

47:03.100 --> 47:05.100
Deploy that with a single click.

47:05.100 --> 47:07.100
Or you want to build something from the ground up.

47:07.100 --> 47:10.100
You go deploy Fedora, Debian, CentOS,

47:10.100 --> 47:12.100
or, of course, Ubuntu and others,

47:12.100 --> 47:15.100
including FreeBSD, and you're good to go.

47:15.100 --> 47:17.100
In less than 55 seconds, you'll have a machine.

47:17.100 --> 47:19.100
It'll have predictable pricing.

47:19.100 --> 47:21.100
It's secure. It's reliable.

47:21.100 --> 47:23.100
It's easy to scale up when you need more.

47:23.100 --> 47:25.100
And if you go to dio.co slash unplugged,

47:25.100 --> 47:27.100
and you have a new account, you sign up.

47:27.100 --> 47:29.100
$100 credit.

47:29.100 --> 47:31.100
A $100 credit at DigitalOcean.

47:31.100 --> 47:34.100
It's designed for developers, but it works for everybody.

47:34.100 --> 47:36.100
A new user, an experienced user,

47:36.100 --> 47:38.100
you'll be really, really impressed.

47:38.100 --> 47:40.100
Countries of open-source projects use DigitalOcean.

47:40.100 --> 47:42.100
Companies like Slack use DigitalOcean.

47:42.100 --> 47:44.100
And they have block storage.

47:44.100 --> 47:46.100
They have S3-compliant spaces.

47:46.100 --> 47:48.100
They have network-level firewalls.

47:48.100 --> 47:52.100
And they have super-fast systems with SSDs everywhere,

47:52.100 --> 47:54.100
40-gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors,

47:54.100 --> 47:57.100
and 12 data centers all over the world.

47:57.100 --> 47:59.100
We got the memo right here to prove it.

47:59.100 --> 48:01.100
dio.co slash unplugged.

48:01.100 --> 48:03.100
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean

48:03.100 --> 48:05.100
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

48:05.100 --> 48:08.100
So go to dio.co slash unplugged and get that $100 credit.

48:08.100 --> 48:10.100
Oh, man, that's a great credit.

48:10.100 --> 48:12.100
Hey, a wild Dan the Rabbit enters.

48:12.100 --> 48:14.100
Hello, Dan. Good to see you. Nice to have you.

48:14.100 --> 48:15.100
Hey, how's it going?

48:15.100 --> 48:16.100
It's going good.

48:16.100 --> 48:18.100
How are things going over in elementary land?

48:18.100 --> 48:19.100
Oh, they're going great.

48:19.100 --> 48:20.100
Yeah, I bet.

48:20.100 --> 48:22.100
I bet it's busy days over there, I would imagine.

48:22.100 --> 48:25.100
I saw you guys had a new app spotlight this week.

48:25.100 --> 48:28.100
That app center is cranking.

48:28.100 --> 48:33.100
Yeah, we're 87 apps now, I think.

48:33.100 --> 48:36.100
I wonder if you'll get to 100.

48:36.100 --> 48:40.100
Is that 87 or 86 or 88?

48:40.100 --> 48:41.100
Can you be more specific?

48:41.100 --> 48:42.100
Yeah, right?

48:42.100 --> 48:43.100
Yeah.

48:43.100 --> 48:45.100
Well, it's just, you know, they're coming in all the time,

48:45.100 --> 48:48.100
so it's hard to keep track of how many there are.

48:48.100 --> 48:49.100
That's the right answer.

48:49.100 --> 48:51.100
How many are Electron, Dan?

48:51.100 --> 48:52.100
Oh, zero.

48:52.100 --> 48:53.100
Oh.

48:53.100 --> 48:55.100
All right, I do want to change topics for a moment.

48:55.100 --> 48:57.100
I want to talk about this infamous Gnome shell leak,

48:57.100 --> 49:00.100
which was more like a memory misbehavior problem,

49:00.100 --> 49:02.100
which I broke down in Linux Action News,

49:02.100 --> 49:03.100
so I'm not going to recap it here.

49:03.100 --> 49:06.100
But it does look like a fix is in the works.

49:06.100 --> 49:09.100
So I want to talk about another part that they bring up.

49:09.100 --> 49:12.100
After all the technical discussion in this post is complete,

49:12.100 --> 49:14.100
there's some final thoughts.

49:14.100 --> 49:15.100
And the author writes,

49:15.100 --> 49:18.100
I'd like to raise an interesting discussion about how people reacted

49:18.100 --> 49:21.100
to the memory leak news and reflect upon this

49:21.100 --> 49:25.100
and screenshot some comments, which I think might be from OMG Ubuntu,

49:25.100 --> 49:26.100
but as you know, it doesn't really matter.

49:26.100 --> 49:28.100
It's comments or comments on the internet.

49:28.100 --> 49:31.100
And when you read through there, you see people saying things like,

49:31.100 --> 49:33.100
oh, of course, this is Gnome.

49:33.100 --> 49:34.100
This is how they always do it.

49:34.100 --> 49:36.100
They don't know what they're doing.

49:36.100 --> 49:38.100
I know you all ask, but the answer is no.

49:38.100 --> 49:41.100
A fix for the big Gnome memory leak is not going to come.

49:41.100 --> 49:43.100
There's all these negative things about Gnome.

49:43.100 --> 49:46.100
And the author says, as a regular contributor for the last few years,

49:46.100 --> 49:49.100
this kind of comments, they sound alien to me.

49:49.100 --> 49:51.100
These comments sound so completely disconnected

49:51.100 --> 49:54.100
from the reality of the development process of Gnome.

49:54.100 --> 49:57.100
It completely misses the individuality of the people involved,

49:57.100 --> 49:59.100
maybe because we all know each other,

49:59.100 --> 50:03.100
but it's just plain impossible for me to paint this whole community as a they

50:03.100 --> 50:06.100
or as, quote, the Gnome developers.

50:06.100 --> 50:10.100
To a deeper degree, it misses the nuance and the beauty

50:10.100 --> 50:12.100
of the community-driven development

50:12.100 --> 50:15.100
and each and every individual that make it happen.

50:15.100 --> 50:20.100
It almost feels, now this is the part that really got me because it's true,

50:20.100 --> 50:24.100
it almost feels like there's a wall between the community

50:24.100 --> 50:28.100
and the users of the community for what it produces,

50:28.100 --> 50:29.100
which is weird.

50:29.100 --> 50:32.100
We are an open community with open development,

50:32.100 --> 50:34.100
no barriers for new contributors.

50:34.100 --> 50:38.100
And yet there is such a distance between the community of users

50:38.100 --> 50:42.100
and the community of developers, design, outreachers, et cetera.

50:42.100 --> 50:45.100
Is it a communication problem from our side?

50:45.100 --> 50:47.100
And how can we bridge this gap?

50:47.100 --> 50:49.100
It's a communication problem from their side

50:49.100 --> 50:51.100
because Red Hat continuously sponsors events

50:51.100 --> 50:54.100
about talking about the Gnome project,

50:54.100 --> 50:56.100
embeds everybody into the Gnome project

50:56.100 --> 51:00.100
when individual applications drive within the Gnome project,

51:00.100 --> 51:02.100
they make it a Gnome application,

51:02.100 --> 51:08.100
and now they expect the credit or criticism to be attributed individually.

51:08.100 --> 51:10.100
Get real.

51:10.100 --> 51:12.100
And I'm a Gnome supporter.

51:12.100 --> 51:13.100
I see your point.

51:13.100 --> 51:15.100
It's sort of been their branding in a sense.

51:15.100 --> 51:19.100
It's been their public persona, has been this cohesive Gnome environment.

51:19.100 --> 51:20.100
Absolutely.

51:20.100 --> 51:22.100
I know that projects are individual.

51:22.100 --> 51:24.100
Once you try to contribute, you learn about it.

51:24.100 --> 51:27.100
But if you're a user, you never see it.

51:27.100 --> 51:28.100
That's the truth.

51:28.100 --> 51:35.100
Even the Git or the source trees goes under Gnome slash Browse Source,

51:35.100 --> 51:37.100
and all projects are listed there.

51:37.100 --> 51:41.100
Never expect that to be a non-unified team of people.

51:41.100 --> 51:42.100
Yeah.

51:42.100 --> 51:45.100
One issue that I've run into just from an outside perspective

51:45.100 --> 51:49.100
is when things get published on like planet.gnome.org,

51:49.100 --> 51:51.100
and then people take that as like,

51:51.100 --> 51:54.100
oh, this is news from Gnome,

51:54.100 --> 51:56.100
and then people in the Gnome community will say,

51:56.100 --> 51:59.100
no, no, that's just like a random individual's blog.

51:59.100 --> 52:00.100
We're just aggregating it.

52:00.100 --> 52:05.100
So it's really like unclear like what is speech coming from Gnome officially,

52:05.100 --> 52:09.100
and what is like just some guy that happens to work on something

52:09.100 --> 52:11.100
tangentially Gnome related.

52:11.100 --> 52:15.100
Is this a symptom of how open source software gets made?

52:15.100 --> 52:17.100
You have people that...

52:17.100 --> 52:18.100
It's a symptom of Red Hat.

52:18.100 --> 52:19.100
Sorry, Chris.

52:19.100 --> 52:20.100
You think so?

52:20.100 --> 52:21.100
No, it's not.

52:21.100 --> 52:23.100
It's not unique to Red Hat.

52:23.100 --> 52:24.100
We've had this as well.

52:24.100 --> 52:27.100
It's because there's concentric circles of activity,

52:27.100 --> 52:29.100
and you've got people right at the core.

52:29.100 --> 52:32.100
You've got someone like Daniel and Cassidy who work on elementary,

52:32.100 --> 52:34.100
and then there are people in the periphery around them,

52:34.100 --> 52:35.100
and then people further out,

52:35.100 --> 52:39.100
and then you've got all the idiots on Reddit who have an opinion

52:39.100 --> 52:41.100
and aren't afraid to use it,

52:41.100 --> 52:45.100
and will voice that uninformed reckon on the internet

52:45.100 --> 52:49.100
and won't be engaged with those people right at the center of the circle,

52:49.100 --> 52:53.100
and that's unfortunately how all open source projects seem to work right now.

52:53.100 --> 52:55.100
Yet when canonical says something,

52:55.100 --> 53:00.100
I can usually know that canonical said it or an individual person said it,

53:00.100 --> 53:04.100
and you guys, actually Ubuntu has made an extreme effort

53:04.100 --> 53:07.100
of demonstrating what is community related,

53:07.100 --> 53:10.100
and you coming in this show many times clarified

53:10.100 --> 53:13.100
what is a community effort, what is a canonical effort,

53:13.100 --> 53:16.100
and it has always been kind of clear as a developer

53:16.100 --> 53:18.100
trying to contribute on things.

53:18.100 --> 53:20.100
When it came down to GNOME, not as much.

53:20.100 --> 53:24.100
I wouldn't characterize it as we do it differently or better

53:24.100 --> 53:26.100
than them in inverted commas.

53:26.100 --> 53:29.100
I'm saying as somebody who has done the outreach, right?

53:29.100 --> 53:31.100
I'm just some guy.

53:31.100 --> 53:35.100
When I tried, I felt better about Ubuntu communication

53:35.100 --> 53:38.100
and canonical communication than I felt about GNOME,

53:38.100 --> 53:40.100
and I'm a GNOME user.

53:40.100 --> 53:43.100
I'm telling you that personally I've had this experience.

53:43.100 --> 53:46.100
I don't want to make this about me or us because it's not.

53:46.100 --> 53:50.100
It's about the GNOME project and the way they manage their projects,

53:50.100 --> 53:53.100
but myself and Martin, we're not paid to be here.

53:53.100 --> 53:55.100
Canonical don't tell us to come on this podcast.

53:55.100 --> 53:57.100
We do it because we want to as individuals.

53:57.100 --> 53:59.100
It's nothing that is part of my job.

53:59.100 --> 54:02.100
I would be here whether I was doing this job or not because I enjoy it,

54:02.100 --> 54:04.100
and I'm pretty sure the same goes for Martin.

54:04.100 --> 54:08.100
Look, that's great, and that benefits Ubuntu and canonical

54:08.100 --> 54:11.100
to the point that there have been cases in the past

54:11.100 --> 54:15.100
that we have detected and I have felt that there was a confusion,

54:15.100 --> 54:18.100
and because you were here, it clarified.

54:18.100 --> 54:21.100
Now, I cannot say the same about the GNOME outreach team,

54:21.100 --> 54:23.100
paid or not paid.

54:23.100 --> 54:27.100
I have not seen people that were clarifying it,

54:27.100 --> 54:30.100
and because there's people in the Ubuntu and canonical community

54:30.100 --> 54:34.100
that understand it and explain it to people, it's easier to understand.

54:34.100 --> 54:36.100
That was my feeling.

54:36.100 --> 54:40.100
Dan usually comes here and also does the same effect to elementary,

54:40.100 --> 54:44.100
and it kind of just enriches the experience.

54:44.100 --> 54:50.100
I guess there could be stronger voices, multiple voices coming from GNOME

54:50.100 --> 54:52.100
that are making it clear what they're doing

54:52.100 --> 54:54.100
and trying to reach out to different mediums.

54:54.100 --> 54:56.100
I think that would be helpful.

54:56.100 --> 55:00.100
I think it's a little bit difficult because they've now got this perception

55:00.100 --> 55:04.100
that there is the them and us, there is that barrier between them,

55:04.100 --> 55:07.100
that whenever they do put their head above the parapet,

55:07.100 --> 55:11.100
they get shot down quite heavily, and I know Daniel has seen that as well.

55:11.100 --> 55:14.100
When he puts a public post out or when Cassidy puts a public post out,

55:14.100 --> 55:16.100
they get a lot of abuse,

55:16.100 --> 55:20.100
and some people just aren't prepared to put their head above the parapet.

55:20.100 --> 55:23.100
Yeah, you'd rather keep your head down and develop and create.

55:23.100 --> 55:25.100
Yeah, that's understandable.

55:25.100 --> 55:27.100
I wonder where they're going to take this,

55:27.100 --> 55:30.100
but it seems like maybe there's some self-awareness of the issue,

55:30.100 --> 55:33.100
and that is, as they say, the first step, starting with...

55:33.100 --> 55:35.100
We're talking about it now, right?

55:35.100 --> 55:37.100
Yeah, and they're talking about it.

55:37.100 --> 55:40.100
I want to share, I guess, an epic that I came across this week

55:40.100 --> 55:42.100
that I thought was pretty neat.

55:42.100 --> 55:44.100
I've just begun experimenting with backing up different aspects

55:44.100 --> 55:46.100
of my Plasma desktop configuration,

55:46.100 --> 55:49.100
and I wanted to create some sort of standardized method to do that,

55:49.100 --> 55:51.100
and so I thought, well, you know, maybe I'll look for an app

55:51.100 --> 55:53.100
that would do it on the Linux desktop,

55:53.100 --> 55:56.100
and I came across KBackup.

55:56.100 --> 55:59.100
Surprise, surprise, KBackup is an application that lets you backup

55:59.100 --> 56:02.100
any folders or files in a TAR archive to a local folder

56:02.100 --> 56:07.100
or a locally mounted device or a USB stick or a remote URL.

56:07.100 --> 56:09.100
So it's pretty simple, straightforward.

56:09.100 --> 56:11.100
It's got profiles and things like that.

56:11.100 --> 56:13.100
I can see why you like this. It just screams, Chris, to me.

56:13.100 --> 56:15.100
It is nice.

56:15.100 --> 56:17.100
Simple, nice graphical tool. You like TARs.

56:17.100 --> 56:19.100
I do. Clear to see what the target is.

56:19.100 --> 56:21.100
Clear to see where it's coming from.

56:21.100 --> 56:23.100
I could say this is my config backup.

56:23.100 --> 56:25.100
These are my documents backups.

56:25.100 --> 56:27.100
You have different profiles in there,

56:27.100 --> 56:29.100
and you can set up jobs and whatnot.

56:29.100 --> 56:31.100
So it's simple, easy, and I'm all about the Plasma desktop these days.

56:31.100 --> 56:33.100
So it's KBackup.

56:33.100 --> 56:35.100
Nice.

56:35.100 --> 56:37.100
I was reading, too, speaking of the Plasma desktop,

56:37.100 --> 56:40.100
in 5.13, there's going to be some implementation

56:40.100 --> 56:45.100
for a pipeline support for remote screen sharing on Wayland.

56:45.100 --> 56:48.100
And I think that also includes screenshots and stuff.

56:48.100 --> 56:52.100
So we'll start getting screen sharing,

56:52.100 --> 56:56.100
maybe even OBS screen capping, remote desktop,

56:56.100 --> 56:58.100
which, remember, all the haters for years have always said,

56:58.100 --> 57:01.100
I can't go to Wayland. I need X as a network transparency.

57:01.100 --> 57:04.100
Well, looks like they're building it into KWayland.

57:04.100 --> 57:07.100
I think you accidentally planned a happy themed episode here.

57:07.100 --> 57:09.100
KWayland. I know. Oops. I know. Oops.

57:09.100 --> 57:13.100
So 5.13 is going to have the early piping for Wayland's desktop session

57:13.100 --> 57:18.100
with remote screen recording and sharing in Plasma 5.13, it looks like.

57:18.100 --> 57:20.100
So I'm looking forward to that. Some good news.

57:20.100 --> 57:22.100
Some good, good news.

57:22.100 --> 57:24.100
It's tradition for us to destroy our studio and rebuild it

57:24.100 --> 57:26.100
just hours before Linux Fest kicks off every year.

57:26.100 --> 57:30.100
It's the one time of year where Noah and I just set a week aside

57:30.100 --> 57:32.100
before Linux Fest.

57:32.100 --> 57:35.100
All of the things we've been thinking about all year, we can bust out.

57:35.100 --> 57:39.100
And this year, you guys have heard me threatening for many, many weeks now

57:39.100 --> 57:42.100
to load my systems up with Kubuntu 18.04

57:42.100 --> 57:46.100
and use that as our production OS here at Jupyter Broadcasting.

57:46.100 --> 57:50.100
But a son of a gun thing about the timing of Linux Fest Northwest

57:50.100 --> 57:58.100
is every single damn year, it falls right around the release of the next major Ubuntu,

57:58.100 --> 58:04.100
which always means every dang year, we end up in this perpetual debate cycle.

58:04.100 --> 58:07.100
Should we use 18.04 or whatever the next release is?

58:07.100 --> 58:10.100
Should we use the current stable interim release?

58:10.100 --> 58:13.100
What should we do if we install the current interim release?

58:13.100 --> 58:16.100
We're going to have to upgrade in a few months to the next release

58:16.100 --> 58:17.100
and all this could break.

58:17.100 --> 58:20.100
Or should we roll the dice and go with something that's a release candidate

58:20.100 --> 58:22.100
but not officially released yet?

58:22.100 --> 58:24.100
Could have some last minute changes.

58:24.100 --> 58:26.100
You never know if software compatibility is there.

58:26.100 --> 58:30.100
It has been tiring and obnoxious because it happens every single year

58:30.100 --> 58:32.100
because we always land on this schedule.

58:32.100 --> 58:34.100
And we've chosen different routes at different times.

58:34.100 --> 58:38.100
I think it might have even been what kind of led us to start using Arch in production

58:38.100 --> 58:43.100
is we just needed current OBS and FFmpeg packages and we were sick and tired of this.

58:43.100 --> 58:45.100
The dance just doesn't exist there.

58:45.100 --> 58:46.100
It just doesn't exist.

58:46.100 --> 58:47.100
But we're back.

58:47.100 --> 58:49.100
We're back on Ubuntu in production.

58:49.100 --> 58:51.100
Full circle.

58:51.100 --> 58:55.100
We decided to just commit to 18.04 and try to make it work and put it in production.

58:55.100 --> 59:02.100
So since our last episode, we have reloaded many systems here in the studio to Kubuntu 18.04,

59:02.100 --> 59:07.100
which as you know, I've gone into a tirade about every time our Gnome 3 system

59:07.100 --> 59:09.100
crashed on us and our recording was interrupted.

59:09.100 --> 59:16.100
I'd go on about how Kubuntu 18.04 is this beautiful mix of LTS Cute and LTS Plasma

59:16.100 --> 59:19.100
and LTS Ubuntu and it's just going to sit there and be an appliance

59:19.100 --> 59:21.100
and it's the perfect solution.

59:21.100 --> 59:26.100
But when it came down to it, we almost went with XFCE.

59:26.100 --> 59:27.100
Almost.

59:27.100 --> 59:29.100
Almost ended up going with XFCE 16.04.

59:29.100 --> 59:30.100
Wow.

59:30.100 --> 59:31.100
Really?

59:31.100 --> 59:32.100
Yeah.

59:32.100 --> 59:33.100
I'll tell you about that story and why we ended up on it.

59:33.100 --> 59:34.100
This would be a different episode.

59:34.100 --> 59:35.100
I know it would be.

59:35.100 --> 59:37.100
It would have been titled Joe was right.

59:37.100 --> 59:42.100
But first, let's talk about Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

59:42.100 --> 59:44.100
They have a huge, huge month.

59:44.100 --> 59:46.100
April is big for Linux Academy.

59:46.100 --> 59:50.100
70 plus new courses and challenges and learning activities.

59:50.100 --> 59:51.100
It breaks down like this.

59:51.100 --> 59:54.100
20 new courses with some refreshes, 50 new cloud assessments,

59:54.100 --> 59:57.100
hands-on learning activities and new challenges.

59:57.100 --> 01:00:00.100
And if you're watching live today, you can catch Linux Academy's live stream.

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:04.100
They're doing some giveaways tomorrow, Wednesday, and it's a big month for them.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.100
It's been really impressive.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.100
They've been staffing up and adding new people.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:11.100
They have instructors that are there to help you and they're writing new courseware.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.100
They're refreshing the old courseware.

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.100
When you're a subscriber to Linux Academy, you just get all this stuff.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.100
All this new content, all these courseware refreshes,

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:22.100
all the new things they're developing, you get that.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:26.100
For example, the Orion Papers is a huge success for Linux Academy.

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:28.100
If you haven't checked it out yet, go check them out.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:32.100
You can go Google Linux Academy Orion Papers as an example of some of the content you get

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:34.100
that is like nothing else anybody else is doing.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:37.100
Because Linux Academy is stacked full of Linux enthusiasts and lovers

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:41.100
and they've got educators and developers that have come together to create this platform

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:44.100
to help you learn more with self-paced, in-depth video courses,

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:48.100
hands-on, scenario-based labs, and like I've mentioned, those human beings that can help you.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:51.100
And they have a community that's stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:54.100
because we've been working with them for almost five years now

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:58.100
and so people have been subscribing from Linux, from Jupyter Broadcasting to Linux Academy.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.100
It's a nice community over there.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.100
We like seeded it with like some of the best people.

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.100
It's true. I take credit for that.

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.100
Yeah, now it's just great, friendly.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.100
Yeah, and they've just grown and grown and grown.

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.100
And they have a course scheduler that's amazing.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:14.100
It'll work with your busy day to help you set a learning goal and stick to it.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.100
They have practice exams to help you get ready to test.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.100
And if you need certification training, they've got that too.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.100
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:24.100
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:29.100
Go there and sign up for a free seven-day trial and support the show.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:32.100
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:39.100
All right, so we did end up on Kubuntu 18.04, but we almost went with XFCE's Ubuntu 16.04

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:45.100
because there was a few unknowns when you're going with a yet-to-be-released version

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.100
of an operating system.

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:51.100
And we tested against 16.04 quite a bit with our capture cards and the whatnots.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.100
We loaded XFCE up.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:57.100
I keep saying XFCE because it doesn't matter which distro it was,

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.100
but it was the desktop we were going for.

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:02.100
But it was Ubuntu 16.04.

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:04.100
And it was okay. It was actually pretty good.

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:07.100
I liked it, but we started noticing a couple of little oddities.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.100
A couple of our production applications we use use system tray icons.

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:14.100
And I didn't expect this with XFCE, but they just stopped showing up.

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.100
Really?

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.100
They weren't showing up.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:19.100
And so we were like, okay, maybe we can fix that.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:23.100
And then we had a couple of other little glitches where it looked like things were –

01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:26.100
I had this issue where one of the panels were flashing when I would move the OBS.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.100
It was just small things.

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:30.100
And Noah and I looked at each other and we thought, you know,

01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:34.100
neither one of us are using XFCE on a daily basis.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.100
All the other machines in the studio are Plasma.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:39.100
We're both using Plasma as our daily drivers.

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:43.100
This is just the OS – I mean, this is just the interface we're getting the most familiar with.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:46.100
And when you're using something in a live production environment,

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.100
you really want it to be something you're hyper-familiar with,

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.100
so that way you can use it almost with muscle memory.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.100
Yeah, just second nature.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.100
Yeah.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.100
So we talked about it, and you know what?

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:55.100
Okay, all right.

01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:58.100
Let's put Kubuntu 18.04 on there and see how it does.

01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.100
And it's been pretty great.

01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:04.100
It's really been problem-free, actually.

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:06.100
OBS loaded up just fine.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:09.100
Our production software, the mixer software, is working just fine.

01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:12.100
Our remote control surface is working great.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:14.100
The usability has been top-notch.

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:16.100
Really, I have no complaints.

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.100
It's been solid.

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:19.100
Hey, Brown Bear, if you want to come here and talk – come on in.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.100
Come on, get in here.

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.100
Come on, Brown Bear, get in here.

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.100
Give me one second.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.100
Come on in.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:28.100
So Noah's been here since Thursday of last week,

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:31.100
and we've been retooling different aspects of the studio,

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:34.100
which really starts with the reloading of the operating systems.

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:35.100
That's really how we start.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.100
That's the root of it.

01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:37.100
Yeah.

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:39.100
Okay, what machines do we want to reload first,

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.100
and how critical are they, and what shows can we do this in?

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:43.100
We had a small production window when he got here

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.100
where there was no shows being recorded until Sunday.

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.100
We didn't end up on CentOS, so there you go.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:50.100
Yeah, so we got the machines.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:53.100
We got the machines reloaded basically Thursday until Sunday.

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:57.100
We got all the machines refreshed, reinstalled.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:59.100
We still have a couple of machines to swap out

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.100
because we found some problems as we went along.

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.100
But it's been smooth, right?

01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.100
Yeah, I think so.

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:07.100
I think what's been really exciting for me is I can tell –

01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:10.100
pretty much early on I can see when you're comfortable with something

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.100
and when you have some reservations,

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:15.100
and it's never the first few days,

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:17.100
it's never the first week that I'm worried about, right?

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:20.100
It's one month in, it's two months in, it's six months in.

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:22.100
That's where I know where something has come,

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.100
because while I'm here and while you can say,

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:26.100
hey Brown Bear, come here and fix this problem,

01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:27.100
then it's not an issue, right?

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:30.100
It's when something becomes routinely problematic

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.100
and it starts as like, well, this is a little bit of a problem,

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:35.100
but you have to solve it week after week after week by yourself,

01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:38.100
that's when you hit a limit and you say, okay, that's it,

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:39.100
I'm done with this.

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:42.100
And so far we have not hit any of those things where you're like,

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:44.100
well, this is even mildly frustrating.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:47.100
So, I mean, time will tell obviously if this work pans out long term,

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:53.100
but it seems like you're making a whole new investment even a year in

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:55.100
to this entire Linux infrastructure.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:59.100
Yeah, well, I think the way to put it is we had too much vodka.

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:03.100
We sat around the studio living room and we said, all right,

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.100
if we were going to hit the reset button today

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:10.100
and just did like a total restart, would we stick with Linux?

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.100
Do you really, really want to stick with Linux?

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:14.100
And we ended up putting another Linux box in

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:18.100
and we're switching over our multi-track recording system,

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:21.100
which for a little while was being done on Windows 7 using Audition

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.100
as we were just experimenting with something that could record 32 tracks

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:25.100
off of a USB interface.

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:29.100
But, you know, it's expensive and it's Windows

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:31.100
and it's proprietary software.

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:34.100
And we couldn't find something that was true top to bottom open source,

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:38.100
but we did manage to find something that does multi-track recording

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.100
on Linux really well.

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.100
You've been using it a little while for Ask Noah,

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.100
so we knew it was a pretty safe bet.

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.100
And it's called Reaper.

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.100
And they don't want you to know it's available for Linux.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.100
They won't even give you a link to download it.

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.100
But if you know how to find it on the internet,

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.100
you can get a binary, you download it,

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.100
and it's a full-fledged production quality multi-track editor and recorder

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:03.100
that we're using right now to record one, two, three, four, five channels.

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.100
And we used it last night to record a 16-track band.

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.100
Yeah, really.

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.100
And what do you think of it?

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:09.100
Oh, I love it.

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:14.100
I've got a Yamaha OM-V96i and picks up all the inputs

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.100
and I sign them in and just streams it straight in and records them all.

01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.100
Yep.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.100
Let me ask you something.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.100
What kind of milk do you guys sell in the state of Washington?

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.100
Why is that?

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.100
I'm just curious.

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.100
Do you have Land O' Lakes here?

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.100
I don't think we have that as butter, but not as milk.

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:27.100
Okay.

01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.100
Well, we have Land O' Leet.

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:30.100
I mean, sorry, not Land O' Leet.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.100
Land O' Lakes.

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.100
Not Land O' Leet.

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.100
I mean, to say Land O' Lakes, not Land O' Leet.

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:39.100
But yeah, Kuko is the company who makes Reaper.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.100
They won't let you have the download link to the Land – or not Land –

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.100
why do I keep saying Land O' Leet?

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.100
They won't let you have the download to Reaper.

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.100
You just have to Google it a little bit.

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.100
Yeah, you Google it around.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.100
You're giving us a hint there.

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.100
Is that what you're trying to do?

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.100
You're giving us a hint right there?

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.100
No, I just – I really felt like milk.

01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.100
Milk, yeah.

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.100
It's a hint.

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.100
Okay, I see.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:57.100
I see what you're doing there.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.100
Okay, I don't know how to decode it, but I know there's some hint there.

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:02.100
But yeah, they won't even let us share the link.

01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.100
We can't – they will come after us.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.100
So just get yourself a glass of milk and you'll be set.

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:07.100
Okay, okay.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.100
I'll try to remember that.

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:14.100
But I was really sort of like relieved because after, you know,

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:18.100
being really kind of stuck with Final Cut and then looking at going, oh, man,

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:22.100
now we have audition, like this is just not the right direction to go in,

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:25.100
it's a big relief to find something like Reaper that does really good multi-track

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:28.100
recording in a production environment and it has all these other little aspects,

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.100
like I like about it.

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:30.100
So it's great.

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.100
I'm really happy.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.100
You know, and one of the things we should talk about too is,

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:36.100
so when we started talking about actually using a machine, right,

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.100
you're pretty OS fluent, right?

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.100
You can jump on a Windows machine, you can jump on a Mac,

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:44.100
you can jump on a GNOME desktop, you can jump on a KDE desktop.

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:47.100
And one of the things that you said that really resonated with me early on

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:51.100
in this project is, man, I sure would like to have one desktop environment

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:54.100
that just runs everywhere because your hands start to get into that muscle

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.100
memory thing of launching applications and where to find individual settings

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.100
and stuff like that.

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.100
And under stress, particularly in a production environment,

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:05.100
the ability to know where all of that stuff is and not have to look or find it

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:07.100
is a huge plus, right?

01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:09.100
So if we can get all of these machines running identically,

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:13.100
I think that bodes very well for the future of Linux in here.

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:16.100
Yeah, I mean, I'm sort of famously the rolling release person,

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.100
but the truth of the matter is there's a super compelling aspect,

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:26.100
compelling, appealing, it's compelling, aspect to combining a desktop

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:30.100
that I'm really excited about right now with a distro that's super well

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:34.100
supported in the industry and a couple of applications that are getting

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.100
good support too.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:37.100
Because at the other end, so Reaper is for our audio,

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.100
but on the other end, we have OBS Studio, which is also getting

01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:41.100
a ton of good support.

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:45.100
So it's like this is a really sweet spot to be in in terms of

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.100
well-supported application from the community, from the developers,

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:52.100
upstream, like all of it's all pretty solid right now ground that we're on.

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:57.100
I'd say this ground feels more solid to me than if I was doing all of this

01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:01.100
on an Apple machine and I'm looking at how Apple is floundering

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.100
with the professional market right now.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:06.100
That feels way, way shakier ground than what we're on.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.100
Yeah. Oh, absolutely.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.100
Especially they can put pressure on a lot of these software manufacturers.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:15.100
So Final Cut isn't going anywhere, even if they do dump x86, go to ARM.

01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:20.100
But what might happen is Reaper may not decide to port their software.

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:21.100
Actually, they already have it on ARM.

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:25.100
I'll use Audition, may not decide not to port to this new Mac platform.

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:29.100
And they'll say a lot of the people, especially in the video side,

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.100
they're sticking on Windows.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.100
And so if that's the case, are they going to port that code base over?

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.100
Maybe, maybe not. We don't know.

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:38.100
And so the ability to be able to buy any machine,

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:40.100
and then the interchangeability of these machines too.

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:43.100
So we were talking about just earlier before we went on the air,

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.100
we've got one machine that's dying, we've got another machine.

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:49.100
Now, if you had to square up the fact that, well, this is an all-in-one

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:52.100
that doesn't have PCI ports, and this is the older one that has the PCI ports,

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:55.100
and this is the new one that has the – you don't have to worry about any of that.

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.100
They're all interchangeable. Any one of these machines can serve any purpose.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.100
They're all different PCs.

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:03.100
Well, actually, we have similar PCs, but they're not like –

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:05.100
it's not like a fleet of iMacs in here.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:08.100
But it's the same desktop environment, it's the same OS,

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:10.100
it's the same exact software.

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.100
And that is really nice from somebody who's working on a tight budget.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:15.100
I just need something that's high-quality production

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.100
that I know we can drop in, that's going to be stable,

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:21.100
and realistically, I might be able to hang out here for five years

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.100
on these 1804 machines if I so choose to.

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.100
You only got to make it a year, and I'll be back.

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.100
I know, right?

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.100
Well, if we get it right, and it just keeps working.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.100
Well, I knew this time we had a pretty good shot,

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:34.100
because if this doesn't work, then he can't do the Ask Noah show here,

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:36.100
so he had to get rid of it.

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.100
So that sort of sealed the deal, I figured.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:42.100
And then we just have been really sort of just doing acrobatics around the shows,

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:44.100
trying to like break components.

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:48.100
Well, we know like yesterday, or no, just this morning,

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.100
this morning we didn't have an OBS machine we could control.

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:53.100
We just, you know, it wasn't done yet, but we didn't need it to do TechSnap.

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.100
So we didn't have to fix that until the afternoon.

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.100
We did kind of buy this, though, because I forgot to set up Love.

01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.100
Yeah, there was that, and we started a little late.

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:03.100
But that's just the sort of fine wire we're working on,

01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.100
but hopefully we'll get this all done.

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:08.100
We'll even maybe have a chill day on Friday and then go to Linux Fest.

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:10.100
Yeah, right, I know, I know.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.100
That's a pipe dream, because for extra credit,

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.100
we're going to try to get down to Wes's pad tomorrow

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:17.100
and maybe set up a little local studio for Wes down there.

01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:18.100
Thursday, I think, yeah.

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.100
Oh, yeah, right, my days are running together.

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:23.100
Yeah, that's right, we still have more things to do here first.

01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:26.100
So we can point you to Reaper.fm,

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:28.100
but you won't find a download for Linux there.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:31.100
But we can tell you, because I'm recording this very podcast in it,

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:35.100
there is a Linux version, and it meets my persnickety needs.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.100
I'm pretty picky when it comes to this type of software,

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:39.100
and it's meeting my needs.

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:42.100
We've recorded three shows with it so far, and this will be the fourth.

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:45.100
And for the listeners using Arch, it's in the AUR.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:47.100
Yeah, of course.

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:48.100
I'll be interested.

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.100
I'm making a snap now.

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:51.100
Are you really?

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.100
Yeah.

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:53.100
You know what else needs a snap badly?

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:55.100
Yeah, I can pick up on the clues.

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.100
I've deciphered your code.

01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:59.100
I've found it.

01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.100
Right on.

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.100
That is huge for me.

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:04.100
Let me tell you something.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.100
You can't just find it by Googling it.

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:08.100
I'm a pretty proficient Googler,

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:11.100
and I know a lot of people in both the Linux world and the audio world.

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.100
You know what?

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.100
You must suck at Googling, because with your clues,

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.100
I Googled it up in no time at all.

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:18.100
Yes, once you know the name, but if you don't know the name of the site,

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:20.100
you're not going to find it.

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:23.100
Anyway, but I'm not going to do the snapping.

01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:25.100
Popey, are you listening carefully?

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.100
Because the reason I'm not at Linux Fest Northwest this weekend

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:31.100
is because I'm at UbuCon Europe this weekend.

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:35.100
I fly out tomorrow, so I'm away.

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.100
Popey, however, he's got nothing better to do,

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:40.100
so he can work on snapping this up.

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:41.100
Wow.

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:44.100
Yes, boss.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.100
I'm looking forward to that.

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.100
And for extra credit, somebody ought to snap up,

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:50.100
but the broadcast using this tool, B-U-T-T,

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:52.100
it doesn't work on modern versions of Ubuntu,

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.100
but it's one of the only graphical tools for Linux

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.100
to do a live ice cast stream.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.100
And there's other ways to do it,

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.100
like with dark ice and liquid soap and whatnot.

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:04.100
You know, there is another tool that I just,

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.100
I don't know why I didn't think of this when we were looking at this,

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.100
but it's so stupid.

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:12.100
Mix has an option for taking a local input,

01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:15.100
you specify an audio device, and it'll just, boom, it'll seal it.

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.100
I had that same thought.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:19.100
That's a lot of software to run for that.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:23.100
The other problem with Mix is it captures the audio device,

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:26.100
so that is the only thing that can use that particular audio device.

01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.100
But it's just a really old X app

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:30.100
that just depends on a lot of old libraries.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:33.100
You've got to load a whole bunch of stuff on your Linux box,

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:34.100
and then you've got to build it from source.

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.100
And it can be done, but then the results vary.

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:38.100
But it's so nice because... I'm on it.

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:40.100
Oh, man, man.

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:43.100
I'll tell you what, we may be in a future where our OBS is a snap,

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:45.100
our broadcast software is a snap, and our editing software is a snap.

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.100
OBS is a snap. I know, I know.

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.100
We trust us. We know it's great.

01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:52.100
And I'll tell you what, it's making me really excited about

01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:55.100
even another level of stability because then, you know,

01:13:55.100 --> 01:13:57.100
we can keep updating these operating systems

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.100
and not worry about this stuff breaking.

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.100
Like I'm saying, we're standing on firmer ground

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.100
than both Windows and Mac OS, I say.

01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:06.100
We may not be so bold, but I think we are.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.100
The future is bright for production on Linux.

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:10.100
And we're going to make an example out of that at Linux Fest Northwest.

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:12.100
Hopefully.

01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.100
Heck yeah, I think we will.

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:17.100
People that can make it out, we'll give you an example there at the booth

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.100
how we're doing it on Linux.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:22.100
I mean, the truth is, if I can assemble even a haphazard setup

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:25.100
while you're on the air without making too much noise

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:28.100
soldering on the back end of a cast iron skillet,

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:31.100
I think by the time we actually have some time where I'm not prepping a show

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:33.100
with right hand and soldering with the left hand,

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.100
I think it'll really be a cool display.

01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.100
Probably should work pretty good, imagine.

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:41.100
Wimbyo, will you be sharing any stories from your trip

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.100
in the Ubuntu podcast in the near future?

01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.100
I hope so.

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:47.100
Me too.

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:50.100
We haven't fleshed out everything that's happening

01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.100
the week that I'm back from that because obviously

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:56.100
it's following the 1804 releases,

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:59.100
lots to talk about there, and nobody wants to hear about me

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:02.100
gallivanting around Spain and having a great time

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:04.100
and socializing with everyone in the Ubuntu community.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.100
Oh boy.

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.100
No, we would hate that.

01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:07.100
Who would want to hear that?

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:08.100
Hate it.

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:09.100
Who would want that?

01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:10.100
Yeah, I know.

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.100
We might do our 1804 review live from Linux Fest.

01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:14.100
I think that might be what happens.

01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:15.100
Looking forward to that.

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:18.100
And I don't know, we may try to record a Linux unplugged from there,

01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.100
so keep an eye out for that, and then we'll release it

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:22.100
at our regular time the following week.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.100
So that could be happening as well.

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:26.100
It's all kind of up in the air, but those are the things we're aiming for.

01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:28.100
So if you want to join us on a Saturday, I would bet.

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:29.100
Have you seen the timesheet?

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.100
Do we have it up on the timesheet?

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:32.100
I don't know.

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:34.100
I can tell you for sure that Ask Noah will be live at 2.

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.100
On Saturday?

01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:36.100
Yep.

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.100
Maybe.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.100
That's our time, you bastard.

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.100
It's 2 p.m.

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.100
It's 2 p.m.

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.100
Yeah, that's right.

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.100
Sorry.

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:43.100
It's fine.

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.100
You take my time.

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.100
Maybe we'll do it a different time.

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.100
I'll take the Ask Noah time.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.100
There you go.

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.100
I'll take it and I'll stink it up.

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.100
There you go.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.100
I'll fart in your time slot, dude.

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:51.100
Don't fart in my time slot.

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.100
I have to live in that time slot the rest of the year.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.100
Yeah, you can go catch more Noah at the Ask Noah show.

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:56.100
Go get more Noah.

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:58.100
Do it.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:00.100
They'll be coming up live in just a little bit.

01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:04.100
You can get more Wes, TechSnap.Systems, and I'm on there too.

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:07.100
And of course, you can follow the whole network at Jupiter Signal.

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:09.100
And you heard me mention that they're Ubuntu podcast.

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.100
You can go get the Ubuntu podcast.

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.100
Go search YouTube.

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:15.100
It's up on the YouTubes now and you can watch it there.

01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.100
Isn't that a development?

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.100
Fancy.

01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.100
We are living in the future.

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:22.100
Now rumor has it that we got to clear out of here because Brown Bear is going to take

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.100
over and do even more Linux coverage.

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:25.100
Destroy everything.

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:26.100
That's true.

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.100
That's true.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:28.100
That's how it goes.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:29.100
Every day.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:34.100
If you want to participate in that shenanigans live, head over to our neck of the woods.

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:38.100
We start all around 1.30 Pacific on a Tuesday at jblive.tv.

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:42.100
You can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com.calendar to get that converted in your time zone.

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.100
Now we got lots of links.

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:46.100
We got RSS feeds and additional podcasts.

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:53.100
All that good stuff at linuxunplugged.com and links for this episode at linuxunplugged.com.246.

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.100
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:27.100
Unplugged.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.100
Unplugged program.

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:30.100
All right.

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:31.100
It's post-show time.

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:32.100
Little post-show.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:34.100
Who wants to get their post-show on?

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:38.100
I thought you were out there soldering while we were in here doing a podcast.

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:40.100
Who needs to worry about show prep, right?

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.100
There are wires that must be connected.

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.100
They must be connected properly.

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.100
Now you got a new toy.

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:46.100
That's all you worried about.

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:47.100
All right.

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:54.100
So elementary OS, in my personal opinion, got right the fact that they have a toolkit for UI,

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:56.100
which makes it consistent across the desktop.

01:17:56.100 --> 01:18:01.100
They've got it right on using mostly one language for development,

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:04.100
even though it's not required that the apps are like this.

01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:12.100
Now my challenge is going to be how about start integrating smart file system management,

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.100
like music recognition.

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:20.100
So it automatically sorts by genre, category, and like of your user.

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:23.100
If you're interested, I can give you the research papers.

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:25.100
I can give you pseudocode.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.100
I can give you an example project.

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:36.100
And you would be essentially the first operating system in the world to have intelligent file system organization.

01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:38.100
Can you elaborate on what you mean like that?

01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:41.100
Or are you just talking like an API that apps can tie into?

01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:42.100
No, no API.

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:43.100
It's something that can run locally.

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:45.100
The software is all open source.

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:46.100
You can benefit from it.

01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:49.100
I'm willing to give you all of the source code about this.

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:52.100
The first category that is already done, it's music.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:54.100
What does it mean?

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:55.100
How do you use it?

01:18:55.100 --> 01:19:01.100
Well, it actually goes through your music collection and evaluates it and does general recognition of the music.

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:04.100
And because you have the music players already on the system,

01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:09.100
you can actually track the amount, you know, the quantity of times that was listened to,

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:14.100
appreciation of music and basically do organization based on it.

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:19.100
So this is like Zeitgeist, but it only does music?

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:21.100
No, this is not Zeitgeist.

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:25.100
Zeitgeist just keeps track of, you know, history of usage, right?

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:29.100
And tries to make those things accessible or preloaded.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:34.100
This is about making actual your music files sorted.

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:40.100
So the algorithms recognize genre, recognize style and recognize music patterns of likings.

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:45.100
And all of these source code is open source, so you can use it.

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:51.100
The idea is that you actually get it so that it sorts the music for your users.

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:56.100
So even if it's just thrown up in the download folder, you can actually categorize that music.

01:19:56.100 --> 01:20:00.100
You can say, give me all the rock and it will give you all the rock.

01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.100
This is like tracker.

01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:05.100
This is like your file systems, terrible mess on this for years.

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.100
Yeah.

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:11.100
The big problem with those kind of things is it's like it just leaves your file system is horrible mess

01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:18.100
and then people end up touching it and it breaks and it's slow and it's better to just like actually manage the files.

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:20.100
So here is the part that I'm going to tell you.

01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:25.100
If you don't do it, Microsoft will do it first and then they will have those users.

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:26.100
That's all.

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:29.100
Didn't Microsoft just shut down their operating system department?

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:31.100
Yeah, because they're going to use Linux.
