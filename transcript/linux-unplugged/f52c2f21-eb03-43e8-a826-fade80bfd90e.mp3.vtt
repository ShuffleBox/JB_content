WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.380
okay so mr. West that is me mr. West should you choose to accept it I have a

00:07.380 --> 00:11.020
challenge for you to take place during this episode what now for a little

00:11.020 --> 00:15.980
episode yep and in episode now you can say no feel free to say no in this

00:15.980 --> 00:21.000
episode I thought it would be particularly cool if we set up a server

00:21.000 --> 00:25.500
for starbound now I have linked instructions it appears to be a pretty

00:25.500 --> 00:29.900
straightforward process to install on an Ubuntu server the only tricky thing is

00:29.900 --> 00:35.420
and this might be the hard part is it requires a Steam login to download the

00:35.420 --> 00:38.060
binary on the account that's already purchased it now I could provide my

00:38.060 --> 00:42.300
credentials uh-huh because I bought oh but I didn't buy it on Steam I got it on

00:42.300 --> 00:48.800
GOG hmm this is like much as a custom team it's like 15 bucks this is this is

00:48.800 --> 00:53.300
minecraft but way cooler it's space travel you go to a planet there's

00:53.300 --> 00:58.780
multiplayer co-op you collect resources you build tunnels that sounds awesome

00:58.780 --> 01:03.460
caves and we could set up a Jupiter broadcasting server on the Jupiter

01:03.460 --> 01:08.140
broadcasting org domain and we could all play I mean be awesome this is a

01:08.140 --> 01:13.260
time sucker that makes minecraft look like child's play and it just came out

01:13.260 --> 01:16.300
for Linux starbound it was actually a Kickstarter for a while so I don't know

01:16.300 --> 01:19.900
maybe that's where it sounds familiar from yeah so take a look at the link and

01:19.900 --> 01:24.700
let me know if you want to take the challenge we'll find out at the other

01:24.700 --> 01:33.740
end of the intro this is Linux Unplugged episode 155 for June 26, 2016

01:42.460 --> 01:47.100
Oh welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's making sure to

01:47.100 --> 01:50.980
drink all of its water and still leave room for beer my name is Chris my name is

01:50.980 --> 01:54.660
Wes hey there Wes hey Chris boy these look like some great brews you brought in on

01:54.660 --> 01:58.540
the show today with a fun name no yeah well how the narrows brewing that's not

01:58.540 --> 02:01.180
it that's not the fun part what's the fun part the fun part is it's the

02:01.180 --> 02:05.780
galloping Gertie golden ale it's great that's not what we're here to talk about

02:05.780 --> 02:09.800
though coming up on this week's episode of the unplugged program we're gonna go

02:09.800 --> 02:15.260
a little bit down history lane talk a little bit with mr. wimpy about his

02:15.260 --> 02:19.420
travels to the snappy sprint event later on in the show we're gonna talk

02:19.420 --> 02:22.720
about a very important open source project getting audited and ask the

02:22.720 --> 02:27.420
mumble room if you could audit any open source using a set amount of money we

02:27.420 --> 02:31.220
saw there's certain limitations which projects would you audit to see how

02:31.220 --> 02:34.980
secure they really are we'll ask them when we get to there well I'm curious

02:34.980 --> 02:38.400
got some really interesting new code open source this week from a company you

02:38.400 --> 02:43.360
probably wouldn't think is open sourcing code open BSD says they're even more

02:43.360 --> 02:47.320
secure than ever now because they're getting rid of Linux compatibility aka

02:47.320 --> 02:51.900
the Linux vulnerability as they say yeah we'll talk about that coming up in the

02:51.900 --> 02:56.980
show a friend of the podcast here's got a new release we'll talk about that and

02:56.980 --> 03:04.800
last but not least at some point we're gonna find out if Wes can complete the

03:04.800 --> 03:08.220
star bound challenge now he's already begun ladies and gentlemen so Wes you

03:08.220 --> 03:13.500
have accepted the challenge challenge except I think it's gonna be great now I

03:13.500 --> 03:16.460
haven't played the game a lot because I as soon as I saw the multiplayer thing

03:16.460 --> 03:19.940
well how do you do this and there's just not a lot of servers out there yet so

03:19.940 --> 03:23.380
we'll see if it's possible Wes is working what right away over there on his

03:23.380 --> 03:27.740
spotnik laptop you know with a nice unplug sticker too yeah I like that

03:27.740 --> 03:31.180
looking good that's looking really good all right well let's bring in our

03:31.180 --> 03:33.740
virtual love so we can get into the stories time appropriate greetings

03:33.740 --> 03:41.460
mumble room hi there well it's good to see you it is good to see you so I have

03:41.460 --> 03:45.700
I have like some good news I want to start with because it's good news from

03:45.700 --> 03:49.500
the least likely source and it happens to be right on the heels of us talking

03:49.500 --> 03:53.180
about this last week which is always a lot of fun West spotted this particular

03:53.180 --> 04:00.100
story it's called surround 360 it's a project by Facebook to make software

04:00.100 --> 04:06.500
pipeline an entire rendering pipeline to do VR 360 images and they also they have

04:06.500 --> 04:09.780
in here they have the code up on github but also in here they have some really

04:09.780 --> 04:14.220
cool specs it looks really cool and a super cool video of the camera that you

04:14.220 --> 04:19.300
need to do this with and I that is all very fine and you can watch the video

04:19.300 --> 04:24.940
it's got a great soundtrack yeah yeah super inspirational and they are they're

04:24.940 --> 04:27.820
building the camera and they're putting it all together and it does look really

04:27.820 --> 04:32.140
cool it's like a dome with a whole bunch of image sensors on there their

04:32.140 --> 04:35.380
stitching software takes the images captured by 17 cameras in the surround

04:35.380 --> 04:40.660
360 and transforms them into a stereoscopic 360 panorama suitable for

04:40.660 --> 04:45.900
viewing in VR the software vastly reduces the typical 3d 60 3d 360 degree

04:45.900 --> 04:51.100
processing time while maintaining 8k per eye quality which they think is optimal

04:51.100 --> 04:55.860
for VR they say the rendering stereo 360 video is a hard problem for a variety of

04:55.860 --> 05:00.660
reasons it takes a tone of RAM roughly 120 gigabytes of data per minute of

05:00.660 --> 05:06.300
video so that's even double when you go to 60 frames per second there's little

05:06.300 --> 05:10.500
room for error because any inconsistencies in the stitching really

05:10.500 --> 05:13.980
look bad and stand out in order to create VR video practically we need to

05:13.980 --> 05:18.620
be able to process all this data as fast as possible which is often an exact

05:18.620 --> 05:23.340
opposition to maximum quality so this thing the software it is it's really

05:23.340 --> 05:27.860
amazing they talk about the acquire tangular how do you know how you say

05:27.860 --> 05:33.020
this equity or equity I can't even say equatorial equatorial triangular

05:33.020 --> 05:38.060
equatorial triangular basically you know the earth turns out as a globe and it's

05:38.060 --> 05:41.620
that when you start they have a diet I'd ever die I can't even bother to get

05:41.620 --> 05:44.940
into it because I would just fail horribly I'm already beginning to but

05:44.940 --> 05:48.180
that's not the important part what's the important part is yeah they can figure

05:48.180 --> 05:52.260
all that you know spatial stuff out for the camera but check out some of the

05:52.260 --> 05:57.220
interesting details the cameras output raw pattern images right on to like a

05:57.220 --> 06:00.940
Linux box then the image signal processor which is part of the surround

06:00.940 --> 06:05.460
360 rendering code converts the raw sensor data into a standard RGB PNG

06:05.460 --> 06:09.020
image oh cool it applies gamma and color correction then the rendering system

06:09.020 --> 06:13.340
reads the camera images and builds the projections from each the projections

06:13.340 --> 06:17.780
cover a whole sphere with a rectangular structure and texture each camera

06:17.780 --> 06:20.420
captures only a portion of the full sphere but this can then be

06:20.420 --> 06:24.340
represented on the projection they put it all together equal rectangular

06:24.340 --> 06:28.340
equal equal rectangular okay thank you I don't know why I can't I can't I just

06:28.340 --> 06:34.500
simply can't but I like this and also remember we just recently talked about

06:34.500 --> 06:39.980
how G streamer is building in stuff to support so the timing on this is rather

06:39.980 --> 06:42.860
perfect because G streamer just put on a whole bunch of infrastructure stuff and

06:42.860 --> 06:47.100
is beginning to work on more and then Facebook comes along and specs out the

06:47.100 --> 06:50.740
camera and releases a whole rendering pipeline yeah exactly good guy Facebook

06:50.740 --> 06:55.380
I don't get to say that very often I don't really we were getting into a

06:55.380 --> 07:00.620
pre-show topic I can't even remember exactly what it was that wouldn't be

07:00.620 --> 07:05.020
said that made me think of it but it essentially came down to my time is very

07:05.020 --> 07:08.700
valuable and I have to be selective about how I spend it oh that's what it

07:08.700 --> 07:11.180
was it was about setting up more servicing thing yeah we'll put that in

07:11.180 --> 07:17.900
the in the post show hopefully boy that boy have I if I said that maybe a

07:17.900 --> 07:21.300
million times how many times I can't even think even in this show I've said

07:21.300 --> 07:28.700
that and that's that's why Joshua Drake's post over at command prompt inks blog

07:28.700 --> 07:35.180
really made me think now he's part of the Postgres equal community and he's

07:35.180 --> 07:42.500
talking he's writing a post that he titled the fall of open source once upon

07:42.500 --> 07:45.860
a time he says Foss was born about was born it was about freedom it was about

07:45.860 --> 07:49.020
exposing quality within source code allowed everyone equal rights and equal

07:49.020 --> 07:52.620
access technique to the technology they were using the idea was if you were

07:52.620 --> 07:55.540
capable you could fix code you could or you could pay someone to fix it an

07:55.540 --> 07:58.580
ideology that there was something greater than yourself and there were an

07:58.580 --> 08:04.660
inherent right to build what was human I sat in a bar slowly nursing beers with

08:04.660 --> 08:08.460
other community members over a period of hours we spoke of many things we spoke

08:08.460 --> 08:13.700
of never ever doing a new post sequel website we spoke of my disdain for

08:13.700 --> 08:18.740
Amazon Web Services since reformed with the exception of s3 we spoke of life we

08:18.740 --> 08:22.380
argued we had honest discourse and that's excellent there was nobody

08:22.380 --> 08:24.780
complaining of political correctness there was nobody claiming to be

08:24.780 --> 08:28.100
offended there was nobody leaving because feelings were hurt there was a

08:28.100 --> 08:31.820
community member who passed out in his chair and dropped his phone we walked

08:31.820 --> 08:35.420
him back to his room to make sure he was safe and all was good this retrospective

08:35.420 --> 08:38.740
has been digging around in my gray matter since that night six months ago

08:38.740 --> 08:44.220
that is until I began to itch and like any good community member I think I'm

08:44.220 --> 08:51.060
gonna be scratching that itch that itch was my time is precious to me it seems

08:51.060 --> 08:55.580
like a harmless thing to say of course your time is precious to you I would say

08:55.580 --> 08:59.180
that's probably true of most people I know that my time is precious to me I

08:59.180 --> 09:02.700
make a point of working part-time from May to September so I can take time for

09:02.700 --> 09:08.180
my family the problem within the statement is context the statement came

09:08.180 --> 09:11.740
from a well-known contributor and a very smart guy the guy the reference was in

09:11.740 --> 09:16.340
relation to why someone would use software as a service and the general

09:16.340 --> 09:20.740
idea was software as a service is awesome because it allows me to have

09:20.740 --> 09:27.140
more time for me then he says the great compromise a lot of companies have come

09:27.140 --> 09:30.140
up with through the ranks to become dominant players in the open source

09:30.140 --> 09:34.220
industry meetup.com for user groups github for development heroku for

09:34.220 --> 09:39.900
software as a service and slack for communications when when considered

09:39.900 --> 09:42.540
independently there's nothing wrong with these services they offer a great value

09:42.540 --> 09:48.020
they increase productivity and more code gets developed the problem is that not

09:48.020 --> 09:52.060
one single of these services are open the use of these services creates an

09:52.060 --> 09:56.180
intrinsic advocate position for closed source software in turn you see you will

09:56.180 --> 09:59.660
see the use of these services increase whilst the use of open source

09:59.660 --> 10:03.300
alternatives decreases consider slack which widely is considered the hot new

10:03.300 --> 10:06.900
collaboration tool yet it doesn't adhere to open standards its network is closed

10:06.900 --> 10:11.420
as is its software and he goes to argue the worst part is is that we had jabber

10:11.420 --> 10:15.420
which is open source yes similar environment as slack supports voice

10:15.420 --> 10:19.500
video plugins external protocols bridges image embedding video sharing file

10:19.500 --> 10:23.820
sharing and yes chat it also supports Federation and allows communities

10:23.820 --> 10:28.740
communicate between each other using XMPP he says the Postgres community

10:28.740 --> 10:32.020
hosts their own code repositories websites and mailing lists we

10:32.020 --> 10:35.820
collaborate in a true version and vision of open source and actively reject

10:35.820 --> 10:39.820
moving our project and externally hosted facilities controlled by services which

10:39.820 --> 10:46.060
are not open source the community puts forth the effort for the community the

10:46.060 --> 10:49.900
moment that open source becomes primarily about my time is the moment

10:49.900 --> 10:55.300
that open source is no longer a movement it's no longer an ideology it's no longer

10:55.300 --> 11:03.900
about fairness freedom equality rights or the greater good damn Wow Nemo I'll

11:03.900 --> 11:08.540
let you jump in first I see you tagging me and then I'll let wimpy jump in there

11:08.540 --> 11:14.860
go ahead new right I mean okay so what I say is the value of open source is not

11:14.860 --> 11:22.260
you know your time is no longer wasted by or you can no longer trade money for

11:22.260 --> 11:31.140
time it's that no one has a monopoly on support so if if someone else can't

11:31.140 --> 11:36.740
support it you can and which then you're definitely using your time as is valuable

11:36.740 --> 11:39.740
to you yeah that's definitely a value of open source I completely agree good

11:39.740 --> 11:46.860
point wimpy you think maybe this is a little clickbait your thoughts sir yeah

11:46.860 --> 11:51.460
a little bit I mean this there's a point there but all of the projects that he

11:51.460 --> 11:57.020
cites so slack and github for example there are open source alternatives to

11:57.020 --> 12:01.340
those manner most and rocket chat for slack for example yeah and get lab

12:01.340 --> 12:07.540
instead of github yeah and well Gatorius has sadly died gone into bit rot but

12:07.540 --> 12:11.380
yeah I mean the code there somewhere if somebody wants to resurrect it which of

12:11.380 --> 12:16.940
course is what open source is great for right and you know matter most and get

12:16.940 --> 12:24.260
lab integrate very nicely now so it is convenient you know we were just talking

12:24.260 --> 12:28.660
about this earlier on the show you know having to do more of the thing you do is

12:28.660 --> 12:33.660
your job in your spare time is not very appealing so I'm reluctant to do service

12:33.660 --> 12:40.860
stuff in my spare time because what I do all day say that to say that these

12:40.860 --> 12:46.060
closed services are the death knell for open source I think is a little bit off

12:46.060 --> 12:52.020
the mark because the development platform the development infrastructure

12:52.020 --> 12:57.140
is all open source so all of the tools and platforms that are used to deliver

12:57.140 --> 13:02.380
those proprietary services are all open source so consequently while you have

13:02.380 --> 13:08.020
the likes of slack and github creating their proprietary software they're also

13:08.020 --> 13:13.100
inevitably going to be contributing back to a number of open source projects

13:13.100 --> 13:19.180
along the way and if you are you know very much of the mindset that you don't

13:19.180 --> 13:23.780
want to run proprietary services and one of the alternative you know one of the

13:23.780 --> 13:28.940
alternatives like matter most or get lab he's out there and not quite doing it

13:28.940 --> 13:33.340
for you then you can contribute to those projects so I felt I felt the title was

13:33.340 --> 13:36.780
a bit click baiting and I also felt that the pros was a bit sort of flowery and

13:36.780 --> 13:41.940
meandering in that point could have got to the point in about four sentences

13:41.940 --> 13:45.780
rather than four pages yeah I do see what you're saying and I think it once

13:45.780 --> 13:48.860
you've started it's just so hard to stop I think oh I think what a part of

13:48.860 --> 13:55.940
partially it is it is a failure to recognize a division like so for myself

13:55.940 --> 14:00.740
there are moments where I would opt to go with a hosted solution slack might be

14:00.740 --> 14:05.300
an example of that where there's other moments where I'll opt to host and roll

14:05.300 --> 14:08.220
of my own like we were just having a sink thing conversation a little bit ago

14:08.220 --> 14:12.060
yeah and those are just different priorities and sometimes it's there's

14:12.060 --> 14:17.620
it's for it's for ideology and sometimes it's simply for practical reasons and I

14:17.620 --> 14:22.700
feel like we sometimes in this conversation forget that there is room

14:22.700 --> 14:26.340
for both there is actually we can have both sets of users and it doesn't mean

14:26.340 --> 14:30.220
one thing is dying or one group is defeating the other group both sets of

14:30.220 --> 14:34.300
groups exist and coexist and use the software for different reasons and

14:34.300 --> 14:39.620
that's what I that's how I look at it so I carry software is an ethical there's

14:39.620 --> 14:44.340
that well then you can choose any other camp but that proprietary software can

14:44.340 --> 14:48.820
also spin off open source software so for example I was looking for a tool

14:48.820 --> 14:54.100
like slack for the Ubuntu mate team and in the end we went with hip chat because

14:54.100 --> 14:59.300
I don't have to host it myself you know there's we use big bucket for pretty

14:59.300 --> 15:03.500
much all of our source control so there's a lot of good overlaps there now

15:03.500 --> 15:08.180
as it happens I've ended up taking some existing open source code and

15:08.180 --> 15:14.040
improving it because I've created some IRC bridges from IRC channels into hip

15:14.040 --> 15:19.440
chat rooms so that we can see what goes on in IRC within hip chat so

15:19.440 --> 15:23.860
consequently I've taken something old and busted and made it work and that's

15:23.860 --> 15:27.580
now some open source that's out there that wouldn't have been had I not been

15:27.580 --> 15:33.660
using you know hip chat admittedly it supports hip chat so it ties into their

15:33.660 --> 15:39.780
API's but open API's are better than closed API's yeah and you could make the

15:39.780 --> 15:43.220
same argument for a lot of services there that's interesting so I wouldn't

15:43.220 --> 15:46.740
be just totally side sidebar did you try out matter most and rocket chat and just

15:46.740 --> 15:50.500
I thought or was it just sort of the I don't really want to spin up another

15:50.500 --> 15:56.700
server it was that the barrier it's I'm perfectly capable of running the server

15:56.700 --> 16:03.020
infrastructure sure but my time is limited in what I do in my spare time on

16:03.020 --> 16:07.300
open source projects and I would rather that that time was focused on

16:07.300 --> 16:13.060
development and pushing the project forward and that's why it's not the

16:13.060 --> 16:18.220
death of open source right there that's just such a good point and you know why

16:18.220 --> 16:21.020
don't we take a moment and I want to thank digital ocean because when it

16:21.020 --> 16:24.980
comes to spinning up systems in record time nobody beats digital ocean with in

16:24.980 --> 16:28.900
55 seconds you can have a rig deployed and you can ready to go and if you're

16:28.900 --> 16:31.980
if you're gonna work with something like Docker there's so many things that

16:31.980 --> 16:37.220
are Docker eyes now container eyes I guess they have such a nice stack they

16:37.220 --> 16:41.060
have a good they have an Ubuntu LTS with the Docker with the Docker software

16:41.060 --> 16:43.820
installed with the repos added and you can you know there's also one with

16:43.820 --> 16:48.820
nginx for me and I think I've told you guys the story but for me I was working

16:48.820 --> 16:54.100
on evaluating rocket chat and matter most and evaluating how they stood up to

16:54.100 --> 16:57.660
different like you know different testing like how do I use it from the

16:57.660 --> 17:01.700
mobile how do I use it with the IRC bridge yeah they're gonna ask once you

17:01.700 --> 17:08.700
make them use exactly and you know what it's funny we we almost went with one

17:08.700 --> 17:12.020
system I put in production at one point and the thing that I the thing that was

17:12.020 --> 17:17.380
really nice to know was that I could revert back to a core system and reset

17:17.380 --> 17:19.660
it up within seconds to make sure it was done right I didn't have to put together

17:19.660 --> 17:23.700
some sort of hack solution ultimately Sean set up a matter most server for us

17:23.700 --> 17:28.460
on digital ocean that's available right now to patrons and that has been running

17:28.460 --> 17:32.620
really great it's a really good system it's super straightforward to set up and

17:32.620 --> 17:37.020
so far it's scaled brilliantly so if you use our promo code over digital ocean

17:37.020 --> 17:41.260
you get a $10 credit the promo code is snap ocean it's one word lowercase you

17:41.260 --> 17:44.940
put that in your account control panel it'll apply $10 to your account yeah

17:44.940 --> 17:48.740
their pricing is really really straightforward and the value is crazy

17:48.740 --> 17:51.940
high so that $10 will get you quite a ways and they got data centers in New

17:51.940 --> 17:57.420
York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam London Toronto Germany and India they

17:57.420 --> 18:02.300
have a really nice interface the back so if you have really no experience or if

18:02.300 --> 18:05.580
you're an expert you're gonna actually be pretty satisfied also their API is

18:05.580 --> 18:08.540
really nice to work with we integrate it in with our workflow a lot of people do

18:08.540 --> 18:11.020
there's some good open source code already written like an applet where you

18:11.020 --> 18:14.020
can add it right to your menu bar and get the status of your drop nice I love

18:14.020 --> 18:18.380
that lots of nice mobile apps to that make rebooting like on the go nice and

18:18.380 --> 18:22.020
easy and straightforward calling other things down actually I've just used it

18:22.020 --> 18:26.860
to like my causal server locked up on me one time and yeah and I just open it up

18:26.860 --> 18:30.220
on my Android app and just reboot the top it's also nice if you're like well

18:30.220 --> 18:35.300
is it a problem on my end okay yeah yeah and then the other things really cool

18:35.300 --> 18:40.500
and gives you a lot of power if you know how to use it is their HTML 5 console

18:40.500 --> 18:44.940
that watches it from post login yeah it's it's how you get certain real

18:44.940 --> 18:47.860
certain things done that are really cool and advanced at digital ocean I just

18:47.860 --> 18:50.340
think it's a great service use the promo code snap ocean let you do it that's

18:50.340 --> 18:53.300
it's not like a advanced feature you have to admit it's right there and it's

18:53.300 --> 18:58.180
just part of the service part of it is they're just really really really smart

18:58.180 --> 19:00.740
about when they implement a feature they do it right and they just what they

19:00.740 --> 19:03.620
focus on like they just rolling out right now block storage you can get up

19:03.620 --> 19:09.660
to 16 terabytes of SSD storage they do SSDs for everything and man when you

19:09.660 --> 19:12.180
know and then when they roll it out they roll it out with just really good

19:12.180 --> 19:15.460
documentation check out their community section look at their dog they have

19:15.460 --> 19:18.820
speaking of Postgres they have the article on segment Postgres here's

19:18.820 --> 19:23.540
Docker composer or Docker compose I guess doctor so it's fun that you can

19:23.540 --> 19:26.540
just deploy it so easily look at this how to protect your server against the

19:26.540 --> 19:30.980
HTTP proxy vulnerability boom right there man that's good timing check it out

19:30.980 --> 19:34.580
digital ocean.com just use the promo code snap ocean and a big thank you to

19:34.580 --> 19:39.340
digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program snap ocean gives you

19:39.340 --> 19:43.340
that $10 credit arch strike has an ISO that's all I really had to say on this

19:43.340 --> 19:46.060
just you know we've talked to these guys back when they were arch assault I

19:46.060 --> 19:51.460
think Sammy assured which is pretty cool and for those not familiar strike was

19:51.460 --> 19:57.540
arch assault it's still based on arch Linux which is totally as Morris's here

19:57.540 --> 20:01.340
renowned and lightweight and highly customizable distribution however the

20:01.340 --> 20:05.020
goal of the project is be a security layer on top of arch has 1200 security

20:05.020 --> 20:08.380
oriented tools for ethical hackers and security researchers but the thing

20:08.380 --> 20:11.340
that's newsworthy here is they've actually released their first ISO it's

20:11.340 --> 20:16.500
available for download today it's 64 bit and 32 bits as the first of its kind so

20:16.500 --> 20:20.860
congratulations to the arch strike team for getting your first ISO out the door

20:20.860 --> 20:25.340
Wes you you knew this is probably gonna give me a riled up when you link this

20:25.340 --> 20:30.220
one in our chat thread earlier today I do like to rile you up oh man that's the

20:30.220 --> 20:37.500
open bsd 6.0 tightens its security by losing Linux that's that's the pitch

20:37.500 --> 20:41.300
most significantly amongst the latest security related changes for open bsd is

20:41.300 --> 20:44.900
the removal of the Linux emulation support prior versions open bsd made it

20:44.900 --> 20:48.540
possible to run Linux applications via a compatibility layer but the release

20:48.540 --> 20:52.900
notes that open bsd 6.0 indicates the Linux up system was removed as a

20:52.900 --> 20:57.340
security improvement as a call from our friends over bsd now I think it wasn't

20:57.340 --> 21:01.340
much used and hadn't been actively maintained yeah yeah yeah make sense for

21:01.340 --> 21:05.700
them to cut it but the you don't have to do all the poking though they would

21:05.700 --> 21:09.100
make us a fun on Twitter yeah open bsd also has ditched the systrace system

21:09.100 --> 21:12.740
policy enforcement tool for the second security and the removal of the user

21:12.740 --> 21:17.820
mount option which have enabled allowed non privileged users to mount file

21:17.820 --> 21:22.300
systems it's yet another security enhancement open bsd project lead Theo

21:22.300 --> 21:27.300
Durant say that the user mount option allows any non privileged program to

21:27.300 --> 21:31.780
call them mounted unmount system calls meaning there is no way any user can be

21:31.780 --> 21:36.780
expected to keep their system safe or reliable with this feature no user mount

21:36.780 --> 21:41.740
for you my theory is that since Windows started doing Linux emulation open bsd

21:41.740 --> 21:45.380
is like no we can't we can't be in the same campus this and they're out that's

21:45.380 --> 21:50.980
a good theory that's actually pretty solid I like that a lot all right I I

21:50.980 --> 21:55.260
don't I don't really have a lot to say about this but I did actually feel like

21:55.260 --> 21:58.780
it was a little tiny teensy bit antagonizing with the harassing on

21:58.780 --> 22:04.020
Twitter and and then they and then they tweeted out and said the distros what

22:04.020 --> 22:07.980
they say operating systems that now have the Linux vulnerability and they listed

22:07.980 --> 22:10.740
free bsd Linux and Windows or something like that

22:10.740 --> 22:15.260
nice yeah haha I just made my computer more secure you know how how I moved

22:15.260 --> 22:21.380
wine yeah haha it's kind of like that yeah not quite though because it's

22:21.380 --> 22:24.860
something that's required by the kernel as opposed to wine user space under your

22:24.860 --> 22:29.100
own user account so implementing user space you know how bsd loves

22:29.100 --> 22:32.180
re-implementing things in user space right is it though but is it not

22:32.180 --> 22:35.780
installed by default is it installed by default on open bsd and why the hell

22:35.780 --> 22:39.620
would that be I don't know if that's true because it's not installed by

22:39.620 --> 22:43.620
default in their free bsd so I mean I don't understand how those BS you know

22:43.620 --> 22:46.260
what I got to watch the bsd now program because they'd probably set me straight

22:46.260 --> 22:48.700
I'm sure like sounds like they've already been covering the story for a

22:48.700 --> 22:51.980
little bit they've you know they see that stuff come sure do but I did feel a

22:51.980 --> 22:56.100
little like haha we gotcha we gotcha there's been a lot of interesting

22:56.100 --> 22:59.460
security use today there's a security vulnerability that supposedly bypasses

22:59.460 --> 23:05.940
HTTPS on Mac Windows and Linux you see that yeah so security is you know makes

23:05.940 --> 23:10.180
me glad the tech snap exists makes me glad that I've got my Linux mint updates

23:10.180 --> 23:14.980
installed that way I know I'm secure there you go off topic does Alan allow

23:14.980 --> 23:18.460
you to set up no no I don't think he does he should offer that is this hosted

23:18.460 --> 23:23.260
streaming solution so something happened and I feel like I should probably

23:23.260 --> 23:26.780
mention it on this show because it's relevant to the audience's interest you

23:26.780 --> 23:32.060
guys want to know I six months after it happened I finally I have finally gone

23:32.060 --> 23:36.880
off my butt I finally have spent hours putting together a new episode of the

23:36.880 --> 23:42.460
rover log of my trip to scale yes yeah and you can see some highlights of Mark

23:42.460 --> 23:45.460
shoulder worse keynote where he's talked about he this was back in January where

23:45.460 --> 23:50.380
he was talking about snap packages and also Cory Doctorow's keynote kind of

23:50.380 --> 23:55.220
made me rethink my stance on DRM and I talked about that's that's rover log 16

23:55.220 --> 23:59.300
just came out and you know I was I was watching this man that's that scale

23:59.300 --> 24:04.460
thing is a huge looking back at art my classroom that is a huge event it is it

24:04.460 --> 24:07.780
is a monster wimpy are you are you by any chance gonna make it to scale next

24:07.780 --> 24:14.100
year I don't know he's hoping yeah yeah I would love to I mean I haven't made it

24:14.100 --> 24:17.180
by my but I think I'm gonna go anyways if you guys want to see that's just a

24:17.180 --> 24:20.700
little taste of it you can check out rover log 16 which went up recently and

24:20.700 --> 24:26.140
rover log 17 is already posted for our patrons at patreon.com slash today which

24:26.140 --> 24:29.740
is the one where I drove into the tornado which was a lot of fun so yeah

24:29.740 --> 24:35.380
so we'd be willing I would check that one out so speaking of snap packages mr.

24:35.380 --> 24:41.740
wimpy is here and he was not here last week no no he was not because he was at

24:41.740 --> 24:47.320
a sprint event held by canonical to bring people together to talk about snap

24:47.320 --> 24:51.400
packages so why don't we let's tell you what let's open up the next block I'm

24:51.400 --> 24:56.900
gonna mention real briefly here ting go to linux.ting.com to get the discount

24:56.900 --> 25:02.300
for the Linux unplugged show and support the show plus you'll have Linux in your

25:02.300 --> 25:06.140
URL history so that way when somebody starts typing L in your browser instead

25:06.140 --> 25:09.740
of your dirty porn habits showing up Linux shows up so linux.ting.com go

25:09.740 --> 25:13.180
there to support this show ting is mobile that makes sense as my mobile

25:13.180 --> 25:16.500
service provider has been for over two years because I just pay for what I use

25:16.500 --> 25:20.500
and six dollars for each line my minutes my messages my megabytes which means if

25:20.500 --> 25:23.780
I'm smart and I do stuff over Wi-Fi like I pre-download my podcast and I listen

25:23.780 --> 25:27.100
to downloaded and like my favorite Spotify playlist catch those local

25:27.100 --> 25:30.860
suckers over Wi-Fi I do extreme quality too which is and I'm like guilt-free

25:30.860 --> 25:36.140
extreme quality oh it's nice and then I just basically pay for the little bits

25:36.140 --> 25:39.420
of backup data that I use when I do go on the cellular network they have two

25:39.420 --> 25:43.300
networks to GSM and CDMA you get to pick from what you want all their devices are

25:43.300 --> 25:46.380
unlocked they have really great fanatical customer service they're

25:46.380 --> 25:49.060
backed by two cows which is an internet company that's been around since before

25:49.060 --> 25:53.100
the dot-com boom I mean a forever they're really in it for the long haul

25:53.100 --> 25:56.380
which is super nice especially when you want a mobile provider that's gonna be

25:56.380 --> 25:59.140
around for a while when the deals like this they have a savings calculator you

25:59.140 --> 26:01.860
can try go over there and check them out you know I was just mentioning the

26:01.860 --> 26:06.540
rover log that entire rover trip I did down to scale was off a ting Wi-Fi it's

26:06.540 --> 26:09.700
really nice and when you're when you are traveling it's nice to jump around from

26:09.700 --> 26:13.940
GSM and CDMA it's a little tricky because we you end up having two numbers

26:13.940 --> 26:19.180
and it but it's only six dollars for the line it's not it's it's really I mean

26:19.180 --> 26:23.380
plus you get I don't want to put a sip number in front give that to everyone or

26:23.380 --> 26:26.780
what I do is I do Google voice yeah but actually I would prefer I would prefer

26:26.780 --> 26:31.580
the sip thing I think these days so check them out at Linux dot ting dot-com

26:31.580 --> 26:35.420
thanks ting so I wanted to go and do the ting spot right there so we could just

26:35.420 --> 26:38.220
sort of open up because I have so many questions for wimpy that I didn't want

26:38.220 --> 26:43.260
to have to interrupt him so prepare yourself wimpy I I guess I want to start

26:43.260 --> 26:46.380
with head what what the hell is a sprint event and how come I didn't hear

26:46.380 --> 26:50.620
about this and we're only certain like Linux elites invited to this thing what

26:50.620 --> 26:55.060
is a snappy sprint and how did you find out about it and why didn't I hear about

26:55.060 --> 27:03.460
it right it was publicized so it was publicized through the Ubuntu insights

27:03.460 --> 27:08.580
and a couple of the yeah I think soft picked it up right yeah so a couple of

27:08.580 --> 27:17.020
others picked it up as well so I was aware of it from that but then shortly

27:17.020 --> 27:24.220
afterwards the Ubuntu community team contacted me and asked me if I would be

27:24.220 --> 27:29.500
interested in taking up a place at the sprint as a community contributor I

27:29.500 --> 27:32.580
guess what I was kind of getting at is I kind of had the sense that this thing

27:32.580 --> 27:36.260
came together pretty quick you know there was there was a brief announcement

27:36.260 --> 27:39.620
about it but all of a sudden it's boom let's do this and it seems like they

27:39.620 --> 27:42.320
were pretty proactive about reaching out to certain people to make sure they they

27:42.320 --> 27:47.820
could make it yeah I think I I think I heard about it about a month before it

27:47.820 --> 27:53.940
happened okay yeah so I think it's probably best if you have questions you

27:53.940 --> 27:58.500
ask because obviously I was there I went to a lot of stuff my head is full of

27:58.500 --> 28:03.500
things to do with snaps I could fire off in all directions well it's probably

28:03.500 --> 28:07.740
best if you've got questions you focus the the conversation I have in front of

28:07.740 --> 28:12.380
me I have a Trello board with the snappy sprint topics on it so I have plenty of

28:12.380 --> 28:16.940
things to get into with you but if you don't mind and you can only you share as

28:16.940 --> 28:22.100
much as you feel like sharing but probably 99% of the people listening

28:22.100 --> 28:27.220
have never been to something like this before and so I mean could you could you

28:27.220 --> 28:30.840
just kind of paint a picture you had you flew somewhere you had that you know

28:30.840 --> 28:35.380
there had to be like a ticket purchase there was hotel space and what what is

28:35.380 --> 28:38.300
sort of the setting like and the experience like going to an event like

28:38.300 --> 28:43.020
this okay so the very first thing that happened is I was asked if I wanted to

28:43.020 --> 28:48.500
attend I talked to my wife and daughter and said can I take a week off work not

28:48.500 --> 28:57.660
with you and go to this thing and they said yeah all right then so then I let

28:57.660 --> 29:01.080
the community team know that yes I wanted to attend and then I was contacted by

29:01.080 --> 29:07.100
canonicals travel organizers and they basically sorted out flights and

29:07.100 --> 29:11.140
accommodations in the room so I didn't have to I didn't have to pay for

29:11.140 --> 29:15.060
anything in that respect so I had my ticket sent to me and a couple of days

29:15.060 --> 29:20.700
before the event of full itinerary of you know what was going on you know

29:20.700 --> 29:25.820
everything you needed to know the one the one thing is that all of these

29:25.820 --> 29:32.780
events canonical have a policy of room-sharing so I was sharing with poppy

29:32.780 --> 29:40.740
so yeah that was nice so yeah flew out there on the Sunday Sunday morning I

29:40.740 --> 29:47.180
left the UK got to the event hotel mid afternoon Sunday the first evening that

29:47.180 --> 29:51.220
Sunday evening there was a drinks reception in one of the rooms the people

29:51.220 --> 29:56.100
attending had drinks and snacks get a chance to mingle a bit yeah yeah get to

29:56.100 --> 30:00.900
meet people the first thing that struck me is I knew there was going to be about

30:00.900 --> 30:08.780
60 to 70 people at this thing and I reckon about mmm about 18 or so were

30:08.780 --> 30:13.020
from outside of canonical so that was quite surprising you know and that

30:13.020 --> 30:17.140
weren't just flavors they were you know from other distributions and projects

30:17.140 --> 30:23.740
completely outside of canonical so that first evening was nice and I got to you

30:23.740 --> 30:26.900
know obviously over the course of the last couple of years working on Ubuntu

30:26.900 --> 30:31.660
mate I've got to know a lot of the Ubuntu devs through IRC but I've never

30:31.660 --> 30:36.180
met them and the only drawback of attending this event is you know as that

30:36.180 --> 30:41.260
as they do you favors and help you out you idly say you know if we ever meet I

30:41.260 --> 30:47.460
will buy you a beer yes well I was but I ended up buying a lot of beer last week

30:47.460 --> 30:56.700
which is absolutely fine yeah yeah so so yeah my my investment in the trip was to

30:56.700 --> 31:01.500
make sure I paid down my debt of beers to all of the people I owe beers to good

31:01.500 --> 31:06.220
man would be yeah and so in terms of how the event works so you're in it's a

31:06.220 --> 31:10.580
large hotel I think there was five or six rooms in total there was one very

31:10.580 --> 31:15.860
large room which could accommodate everybody and then four or five smaller

31:15.860 --> 31:21.020
rooms which could take between I think about 20 people or so in each room this

31:21.020 --> 31:26.620
is legitimately a mini conference yeah yeah it really was every morning starts

31:26.620 --> 31:31.340
with an opening session that says what we're going to do this day so you've got

31:31.340 --> 31:35.580
the Trello board there they basically explain where the rooms are what's going

31:35.580 --> 31:41.060
to happen and throughout the day there are three tracks running and each

31:41.060 --> 31:48.380
session runs for about 45 minutes to an hour so it's very fast-paced and it's

31:48.380 --> 31:52.660
sort of an introduction to a topic and some discussion around a topic and

31:52.660 --> 31:58.340
actions and proposals are taken at the end of each of those sessions there's a

31:58.340 --> 32:03.060
mid-morning break and canonical provided drinks and refreshments and snacks

32:03.060 --> 32:07.380
mid-morning break and the mid-afternoon break and they provided lunch as well

32:07.380 --> 32:17.380
and breakfast so yeah they looked after everybody and then mid-afternoon there

32:17.380 --> 32:22.380
was the option to go into the larger room and participate in a two-hour

32:22.380 --> 32:27.780
hacking session so if you'd learned something or taken an action or wanted

32:27.780 --> 32:31.340
to progress something you had a couple of hours each day where you could

32:31.340 --> 32:35.180
collaborate and you know and work on that stuff was this one of the times

32:35.180 --> 32:39.620
Frank showed up and talked to people about next cloud and Frank actually

32:39.620 --> 32:43.220
turned up sort of at the end of one of the days so I just happened to see him

32:43.220 --> 32:47.460
sort of wandering around the hotel looking slightly lost and I just

32:47.460 --> 32:51.620
overheard somebody say oh no Frank from own cloud should be from next cloud

32:51.620 --> 32:56.060
should be turning up in a minute and I bumped into him so I said I I said I

32:56.060 --> 33:00.380
introduced myself and then said I know where you need to be art so I escorted

33:00.380 --> 33:04.300
him to the right room and introduced him to whoever he needs to talk to did he

33:04.300 --> 33:08.180
have a camera with him not that I noticed you don't have a bag over his

33:08.180 --> 33:13.860
shoulder I imagine that could have held the camera so a very interesting so it

33:13.860 --> 33:18.300
sounds like a pretty pretty high rated event in terms of a nice room nice

33:18.300 --> 33:22.820
accommodations room sharing but drinks and all kept can't be ignored I look at

33:22.820 --> 33:27.820
the list here of travel stuff which is nice that it's public and I'm not getting

33:27.820 --> 33:33.420
a set a central theme or a central sense of this was with a big focus towards

33:33.420 --> 33:39.340
unity 8 and mobile or a big focus on cloud I'm getting kind of a lot of

33:39.340 --> 33:42.660
different priorities here from individual Internet of Things type

33:42.660 --> 33:46.580
devices to full desktop applications did you walk away with the sense having

33:46.580 --> 33:54.300
attended that there was like a core theme there wasn't a core theme because

33:54.300 --> 33:58.380
as you can see from the Trello there were lots of different topics you know

33:58.380 --> 34:02.820
the things that are marketing red that's the community and cross distro stuff and

34:02.820 --> 34:09.740
that tended to have a desktop focus so that was more desktop focus the plan for

34:09.740 --> 34:15.700
a runtime to desktop snap issues interesting okay and and gnome runtime

34:15.700 --> 34:21.060
was part of that session and arch Linux and the open suzer OBS snap integration

34:21.060 --> 34:25.820
was in there as well and in the yellow sessions those were more specifically

34:25.820 --> 34:33.580
about the evolution of snap D itself and snap craft so the sort of the

34:33.580 --> 34:38.220
fundamental tools and there was a lot of interesting discussions there and then

34:38.220 --> 34:42.660
there were some new tools announced I don't know if these exist pre-existed

34:42.660 --> 34:52.140
but there's a thing called snap web now so that is a a web UI that talks to the

34:52.140 --> 34:59.100
Unix domain socket of snap D and presents a complete UI of your snap

34:59.100 --> 35:04.300
environment so that you can very handy install snap wonderful access the store

35:04.300 --> 35:09.320
see featured apps and it even does clever stuff like if this is on a

35:09.320 --> 35:17.260
device it will show you the components that are specific to that device so

35:17.260 --> 35:22.940
there was some examples of router switches and stuff like that that look

35:22.940 --> 35:27.140
very interesting Wow so that there was a few things that

35:27.140 --> 35:30.080
did come out that surprised me you touched on it there just for a moment

35:30.080 --> 35:34.400
you said gnome runtime I thought that was a flat I thought that was a flat

35:34.400 --> 35:40.980
pack thing so the thing about so runtime I think is this the the flat pack

35:40.980 --> 35:46.540
terminology I think the terminology that's going to come out of snaps is

35:46.540 --> 35:52.340
these will be called platform snaps but you asked if there was sort of a general

35:52.340 --> 35:58.180
theme no but one of the key concepts that cropped up all the way through the

35:58.180 --> 36:04.340
week is what they called content sharing or the content interface so that's a

36:04.340 --> 36:12.380
new feature and that is the mechanism by which shared runtimes or platforms or

36:12.380 --> 36:19.820
things like artwork snaps can be created so that if you are creating

36:19.820 --> 36:27.380
application snaps for the gnome desktop you can now use the gnome 320 platform

36:27.380 --> 36:34.300
snap as a dependency and through bind mounting in the way that snaps you know

36:34.300 --> 36:40.100
integrate that will be a common platform available to all of the things that

36:40.100 --> 36:46.740
require it so an end user implementation would I have a gnome 320 runtime mounted

36:46.740 --> 36:51.420
file system squash fs file system and whatever the application squash fs file

36:51.420 --> 36:55.580
system mounted at the same time two different mounts for one application it

36:55.580 --> 37:01.060
would appear as one but underneath yes it'd be two oh yeah yeah so it handles

37:01.060 --> 37:05.100
the magic behind the scenes and also things like taking the artwork out so

37:05.100 --> 37:10.460
taking the themes and the icon sets out of the applications and even out of the

37:10.460 --> 37:15.300
platform snaps and making those separately available and then there are

37:15.300 --> 37:22.780
mechanisms to then create trust relationships between those snaps so if

37:22.780 --> 37:28.580
they need to move in lockstep you can use assertions to actually say these

37:28.580 --> 37:33.940
things have to move at the same versions if that's if that's the requirement

37:33.940 --> 37:40.060
yeah yeah not just in desktop but also in server deployment it was it was a

37:40.060 --> 37:43.980
particular that the particular conversation around is called gating in

37:43.980 --> 37:51.500
snap speak but that was particularly for devices where you may have a kernel

37:51.500 --> 37:56.060
component and an application component that requires another and then the

37:56.060 --> 38:00.700
interaction between those three and to make sure you can't accidentally have a

38:00.700 --> 38:06.700
snap upgrade in that chain that is not compatible mm-hmm I hadn't really thought

38:06.700 --> 38:11.660
of that particular problem that's that is interesting so did you get a sense of

38:11.660 --> 38:16.220
what is the application that can't be snapped is it or what is the piece of

38:16.220 --> 38:19.740
software delivered for Linux and like I'm thinking of things like Nvidia

38:19.740 --> 38:25.380
drivers or oh yeah what are the limits what where where do snaps stop and you

38:25.380 --> 38:31.380
have to use something else well there's there's two sides to this so there is

38:31.380 --> 38:38.780
the classic system that can install snaps for example and you obviously have

38:38.780 --> 38:44.820
some host requirements and the host can be a combination of the classic system

38:44.820 --> 38:52.260
and the core snap and then you have a fully snapped environment where the

38:52.260 --> 38:58.180
whole device is a series of snaps that build the complete environment so you

38:58.180 --> 39:04.860
only have snaps I don't think that anything was discussed that was an

39:04.860 --> 39:09.580
outright it can't be done there are things that can't be done now but but

39:09.580 --> 39:15.140
all of those all of the things that were discussed were this is the plan and we

39:15.140 --> 39:18.460
will you know cross that bridge when we get to it sort of thing so there's

39:18.460 --> 39:24.140
there's some more complex interactions to consider when like full desktop

39:24.140 --> 39:29.140
environments are snapped in their entirety and how things like display

39:29.140 --> 39:33.140
managers and session managers and setting demons interact with one another

39:33.140 --> 39:40.240
yeah you know so that's a little ways out but in general I didn't know that

39:40.240 --> 39:44.780
requires like a kernel module at boot you know like a like a ZFS snap or Nvidia

39:44.780 --> 39:49.980
driver snap or a VMware snap that has a you know the VM DK kernel module yeah so

39:49.980 --> 39:54.380
on on devices at the moment you can have kernel snaps and gadget snaps so I think

39:54.380 --> 39:59.860
that you know in that fully snapped device platform that's that's a

39:59.860 --> 40:03.620
possibility that's that's something that's been you know solved so I want to

40:03.620 --> 40:07.140
I just want to throw just as an example a question at you that might illustrate

40:07.140 --> 40:12.540
maybe the variety of people in attendance I see a card here for

40:12.540 --> 40:16.980
integrating snap support into the openSUSE of build service is that

40:16.980 --> 40:20.820
actually going to happen or was it just theoretical code that is never going to

40:20.820 --> 40:24.660
be integrated upstream to the build service no it was demonstrated it's

40:24.660 --> 40:30.100
there already and in fact that work the the one of the screenshots I sure saw

40:30.100 --> 40:34.660
was a build log for from three weeks previous so they'd actually done some

40:34.660 --> 40:40.940
work prior to turning up wow okay all right so then the other thing that seems

40:40.940 --> 40:46.060
to be perhaps an olive branch to the fedora camp is I see entries in here for

40:46.060 --> 40:50.780
getting SC Linux confinement now just recap for the audience one of the ideals

40:50.780 --> 40:54.460
behind snap packages is that they are confined to their own space and that

40:54.460 --> 40:58.580
they're not only they're a little safer for the end-user but maybe isolated from

40:58.580 --> 41:04.740
security vulnerabilities a bit more and that confinement is currently I guess

41:04.740 --> 41:08.340
you would say created or done by app armor I don't know exactly what they

41:08.340 --> 41:12.140
with a term is the app armor is used to create that confined environment which

41:12.140 --> 41:17.220
is not really the paradigm that fedora uses red hat is really behind SC Linux

41:17.220 --> 41:21.420
and so is fedora and SC Linux is also capable of delivering confinement like

41:21.420 --> 41:25.900
that but I you know it's it's not losing I don't think snap was created with that

41:25.900 --> 41:30.380
intention so how how how likely is that do you think that maybe they could get

41:30.380 --> 41:34.020
SC Linux support and did you get a sense from people that were there from fedora

41:34.020 --> 41:38.820
that this is something the project might actually adopt I got the strong

41:38.820 --> 41:43.980
impression that support is coming and there was some discussion around how

41:43.980 --> 41:50.780
that can be implemented and one of the lead developers from canonical had done

41:50.780 --> 41:54.260
the initial discovery work and was confident that it could be implemented

41:54.260 --> 42:00.740
and I don't know what the schedule that will be but it was definitely considered

42:00.740 --> 42:06.820
doable and something that will be done at some point the the speed at which the

42:06.820 --> 42:11.620
snap package I don't even know you can't even call it one thing but the whole

42:11.620 --> 42:16.620
ecosystem snap ecosystem is evolving seems to be really fast faster than app

42:16.620 --> 42:19.860
image and flat pack and it already seems to be more feature complete

42:19.860 --> 42:24.060
especially when you take in some of the additional stuff that's coming out when

42:24.060 --> 42:27.860
when you when you arrive there was there anything that changed your in your

42:27.860 --> 42:33.820
mindset after you left for example is there going to be perhaps a shift in how

42:33.820 --> 42:38.580
Ubuntu Mate implement snaps is it going to be a maybe a greater snap investment

42:38.580 --> 42:41.220
is it going to be still only certain applications like is anything in that

42:41.220 --> 42:47.940
regard changing so when I went out there I'd got like three or four things that

42:47.940 --> 42:52.780
I want to understand so that I could better you know think about how Ubuntu

42:52.780 --> 42:58.060
Mate could benefit all of those questions were answered on day one hmm

42:58.060 --> 43:01.740
so I was thinking well this is a good start because everything I came here for

43:01.740 --> 43:05.620
is now being you know I know what the road ahead is so I've now got four more

43:05.620 --> 43:09.700
days to find out all this other stuff so to give you an idea one of the things I

43:09.700 --> 43:18.260
want to do is integrate snap support into the software boutique and I wrote a

43:18.260 --> 43:25.660
prototype Python client that enables you to install and remove packages using you

43:25.660 --> 43:33.060
know the snap D API but whilst I was there I was talking to Robert Ansell one

43:33.060 --> 43:37.940
of the Ubuntu developers and he's talking about actually making a lib snap

43:37.940 --> 43:44.180
DC library and then exposing that via object and QT object so that all of the

43:44.180 --> 43:49.700
other projects can wrap it and use it so you know things like that are just

43:49.700 --> 43:54.900
terrific because that's a way that anyone can then exploit the facilities

43:54.900 --> 43:59.900
of the snap API within their applications pretty much irrespective of

43:59.900 --> 44:04.780
what language you're you're implementing in right everything's got got an

44:04.780 --> 44:11.060
interface to see yeah exactly and other things that I wanted to understand was

44:11.060 --> 44:17.220
particularly this concept of runtime or platform snaps yeah and you can see that

44:17.220 --> 44:22.580
was the first session on day one so after one hour it was like oh right

44:22.580 --> 44:27.580
that's how we're doing it fine so then the rest of the week was was starting on

44:27.580 --> 44:34.860
some of that work hmm and can you help me understand a little bit of the the

44:34.860 --> 44:41.300
security paradigm around snap packages so they have to be granted access to

44:41.300 --> 44:45.340
things on the file system and it looks like from the docs that I was reading

44:45.340 --> 44:47.860
from the elementary team when they're looking at how to integrate snaps with

44:47.860 --> 44:51.660
elementary OS is there could be certain some of their programs that they make

44:51.660 --> 44:56.700
in-house for their desktop might need special access in ways that maybe snaps

44:56.700 --> 45:01.380
don't facilitate now I only I only briefly skim the documentation but it

45:01.380 --> 45:06.860
sounds like there's a limited ways snap software can access the system currently

45:06.860 --> 45:12.900
and some of those might be limiting am I tracking at all yeah so they're called

45:12.900 --> 45:19.020
interfaces so when you use snap craft to create your package you tell your

45:19.020 --> 45:25.980
software what interfaces it can connect to so one example is the home interface

45:25.980 --> 45:31.940
which exposes some of your home directory and I'll maybe we'll talk

45:31.940 --> 45:36.820
about what that means in some expect some respects and that interface is

45:36.820 --> 45:42.500
auto-connected so what that means is when you install a snap package that

45:42.500 --> 45:48.540
uses the home interface it automatically connects that up and that snap has

45:48.540 --> 45:52.620
access to those areas of your home directory that are available to snap

45:52.620 --> 45:59.900
packages there are other interfaces that do not auto connect so you can install

45:59.900 --> 46:05.700
the snap package you can look at the status of the snap package and see that

46:05.700 --> 46:11.180
is requesting that it has this facility and it's down to you to actually

46:11.180 --> 46:15.820
establish that connection manually that's how it is right now there are

46:15.820 --> 46:18.860
there quite a lot of interfaces and that's where a lot of the focus has been

46:18.860 --> 46:23.340
if you look at the change logs on snap D and snap draft it's really been about

46:23.340 --> 46:28.940
interfaces and they're being added a lightning rate and will continue to be

46:28.940 --> 46:35.900
added to support the various use cases but the end goal is to have mediation so

46:35.900 --> 46:41.860
if you've used Ubuntu for devices on a phone or a tablet when that has

46:41.860 --> 46:47.620
permissions that it requires it actually tells you oh this application wants to

46:47.620 --> 46:53.260
connect to your camera do you want to allow that and you say yes or no there's

46:53.260 --> 46:57.300
an interface to facilitate that question not at the moment but that's what's

46:57.300 --> 47:03.060
going to come so so you will tell your snap what it can request and then it's

47:03.060 --> 47:07.180
down to the user whether or I don't know if there's an override because for

47:07.180 --> 47:12.260
example some things you just absolutely have to be able to tell your snap it can

47:12.260 --> 47:16.540
have this thing otherwise it won't work at all so I'm not you know I didn't see

47:16.540 --> 47:20.340
I didn't sit in on all of these sessions so I don't know all of the nuances but

47:20.340 --> 47:24.420
the idea is that there will be prompts to actually guide the user that snap is

47:24.420 --> 47:28.140
requesting this thing do you want to approve that so hardware aside it sounds

47:28.140 --> 47:31.820
like it has it automatically has connection to your home directories like

47:31.820 --> 47:38.860
any user space application might so yes and no okay okay when you install a snap

47:38.860 --> 47:43.980
that has access to the home interface it actually has access to a directory which

47:43.980 --> 47:50.020
is slash snap slash the name of the snap slash the revision of that snap and

47:50.020 --> 47:55.260
that's where the the data and the dot files and things like that so that's the

47:55.260 --> 48:01.140
equivalent of dollar home as far as that snap which is concerned but it can

48:01.140 --> 48:05.420
actually see all of the other directories in your home directory with

48:05.420 --> 48:12.660
the exception of any dot directories or dot files so snaps can't see any dot

48:12.660 --> 48:17.340
files or dot directories except for those that exist within their own data

48:17.340 --> 48:24.700
directory okay so that okay that actually answers most of the questions I

48:24.700 --> 48:27.300
had around the security of it and I'm you know I'm sure I'll play with it more

48:27.300 --> 48:32.860
is it as it comes along so I don't I use any other any other thoughts you want to

48:32.860 --> 48:38.580
share about the trip or about the event itself it seems like one of the things

48:38.580 --> 48:44.540
that I always experience when I go to something like this is the unexpected

48:44.540 --> 48:48.940
collaboration that happens sort of in the hallways getting to meet people like

48:48.940 --> 48:53.220
you mentioned earlier and paying off beer debts I'm just kind of just kind of

48:53.220 --> 48:55.620
picking your brain as far as any other experiences you want to share on the

48:55.620 --> 48:58.740
trip and sort of any elements about that about rubbing shoulders anybody you got

48:58.740 --> 49:02.180
to meet or anything you want to share in that regard yeah I mean obviously the

49:02.180 --> 49:08.500
social track is just as important as the getting stuff done track during it really

49:08.500 --> 49:14.500
was and so a group of people that I got to meet and spent the week with most of

49:14.500 --> 49:18.300
the week actually because we were in the same room a lot of the time was three of

49:18.300 --> 49:26.100
the guys from elementary so Daniel for a Cody Garver and Cortana sorry I've

49:26.100 --> 49:30.660
forgotten your surname so those three guys from elementary were there all week

49:30.660 --> 49:37.500
and yeah Daniel and I exchanged some notes on you know stuff he's doing on

49:37.500 --> 49:42.140
with elementary and low-key coming up and I had a look through what they've

49:42.140 --> 49:46.140
been working on and I showed him some of the new stuff I've been working on so

49:46.140 --> 49:51.300
here's a little tip for you Chris you are talking about the nice high DPI

49:51.300 --> 49:58.180
support in Linux mint 18 you really want to have a look at low-key okay because

49:58.180 --> 50:04.460
their high DPI support actually knows that it's on a high DPI capable machine

50:04.460 --> 50:10.860
that was my complaint automatic yeah and although Daniel showed me the bits

50:10.860 --> 50:15.860
where it needs you know there's a few icons that aren't scaled correctly in

50:15.860 --> 50:21.060
spots yet but by and large it's there and it's looking very polished and very

50:21.060 --> 50:28.420
complete now so and because all of their applications are all you know use that

50:28.420 --> 50:32.380
same design language and they've been through the process of making sure that

50:32.380 --> 50:37.060
you know it's all high DPI they're out-of-the-box default applications that

50:37.060 --> 50:43.060
are all high DPI and it looks looks the business you know I completely agree

50:43.060 --> 50:48.980
with that rei code in the rei code in the chat room elementary OS with those

50:48.980 --> 50:53.200
potential nice touches to detail combined with snapped applications

50:53.200 --> 50:56.900
could make elementary OS a much more viable platform for me so I'm gonna be

50:56.900 --> 51:00.940
really interested to try that out good for them so so three different reps I'm

51:00.940 --> 51:04.540
sure you probably I'm sure probably just too busy to talk to Clem I'm sure he was

51:04.540 --> 51:09.380
yeah it seems like there was an intention to reach out to like open wrt

51:09.380 --> 51:14.340
that's really interesting yeah yeah so so I think that I think it's fair to say

51:14.340 --> 51:16.940
that you know I've talked about the content interface sharing and you're

51:16.940 --> 51:21.780
asking for a theme definitely on Wednesday Wednesday night there was a

51:21.780 --> 51:27.620
meal everyone that was there was in the big room together we had this fantastic

51:27.620 --> 51:33.460
outdoor barbecue and then did lightning talks and most of the people doing

51:33.460 --> 51:39.180
lightning talks were from the community contributors that had been invited and

51:39.180 --> 51:46.640
it was very clear that that community participation and involvement was

51:46.640 --> 51:54.820
important to developing snaps and making snaps work for everyone so you know it

51:54.820 --> 52:02.020
was it was very much a bring this to the wider ecosystem don't just focus on a

52:02.020 --> 52:06.180
bun too it was that was clearly a strong message that came through this last week

52:06.180 --> 52:13.140
that's really great when we thank you for for sharing your trip with us it

52:13.140 --> 52:17.380
sounds like the exact kind of event that needed to happen and it sounds like a

52:17.380 --> 52:21.300
lot of great people are invited and it wasn't just a big Ubuntu echo chamber

52:21.300 --> 52:25.260
which is brilliant and I think one of the metrics that I use to measure that

52:25.260 --> 52:30.420
is reading the blogs of people from arch and fedora who came back and said this

52:30.420 --> 52:34.140
is really something and that's pretty cool and it's exciting to see that kind

52:34.140 --> 52:38.220
of on the verge and from an end-users perspective you know eventually this is

52:38.220 --> 52:42.660
gonna work our way into our into our desktops and when developers and others

52:42.660 --> 52:46.180
and packagers are excited to use something yes get software to us yeah

52:46.180 --> 52:51.260
that's awesome I know and it's gonna give it a clear path for people who want

52:51.260 --> 52:54.620
to bring software over to Linux something to tell Mike finally yeah I

52:54.620 --> 52:59.380
will and so on on that point one of the last things that was discussed on the

52:59.380 --> 53:04.020
last day was talking about proprietary software and the actual discussion was

53:04.020 --> 53:09.180
if I've made a snap for a thing I can't redistribute what do I do about it but

53:09.180 --> 53:13.580
then the conversation evolved into there are these companies that are basically

53:13.580 --> 53:18.540
dodging packaging their software in the appropriate way for the various Linux

53:18.540 --> 53:22.860
distributions because it's hard and there's too many things to target so you

53:22.860 --> 53:27.740
get these dot run files or you get a deb file for one architecture that maybe

53:27.740 --> 53:31.860
only works for one particular version of Ubuntu and there was this whole

53:31.860 --> 53:35.540
discussion about how we could potentially create snaps for those

53:35.540 --> 53:39.620
proprietary applications and then send them to those organizations and say you

53:39.620 --> 53:46.780
could do it this way yeah really and you know that seems like that it's too hard

53:46.780 --> 53:50.500
excuse with things like the shared platforms and snap craft going cross

53:50.500 --> 53:55.740
distribution is going to be a weaker and weaker argument and then on the end user

53:55.740 --> 54:02.540
side gnome software version 3.21.4 will have support for installations of flat

54:02.540 --> 54:08.100
pack repository files in the flat pack repo format and installation of snaps

54:08.100 --> 54:12.380
and then yeah and this is going to be this is going to make the end user

54:12.380 --> 54:16.860
perspective at least on the gnome desktop and anybody using gnome software this is

54:16.860 --> 54:20.300
gonna make this really straightforward also which is kind of neat and now a

54:20.300 --> 54:24.700
relevant thing sandboxing information will be shown for the certain apps along

54:24.700 --> 54:27.740
with the origin information when the apps are available for more than one

54:27.740 --> 54:34.260
source in gnome software which is I mean I can't wait to see that I can I'm

54:34.260 --> 54:37.700
getting really excited about the direction this is going and I don't

54:37.700 --> 54:40.940
even I don't even I'm still like I'm still happy if we end up with flat packs

54:40.940 --> 54:44.300
and snaps like I'm not necessarily pulling for one but I think it's really

54:44.300 --> 54:49.420
brilliant where what canonical has been doing with snaps and I think it's really

54:49.420 --> 54:53.100
great that the momentum they're building behind it is likely to lead to success

54:53.100 --> 54:56.340
it feels like they're really on a good trajectory right now so that makes me

54:56.340 --> 55:00.180
excited we're gonna check thank you wimpy thank you very much that was that

55:00.180 --> 55:03.300
was a great that was that was actually painted a great picture I know I'm

55:03.300 --> 55:07.340
excited we were there mm-hmm you know you're welcome thank you we are going to

55:07.340 --> 55:12.780
find out if Wes was successful in the starbound server challenge which he was

55:12.780 --> 55:16.300
just I like that you were down for it because I didn't warn you at all that's

55:16.300 --> 55:21.100
gonna be throwing this at you and you know before we reveal if Wes was

55:21.100 --> 55:24.060
successful and get to our next topic this would be a great spot to mention

55:24.060 --> 55:27.140
Linux Academy where you could go to get the mad skills to learn how to set up a

55:27.140 --> 55:31.820
server when you are thrust into a situation to do so Linux Academy comm

55:31.820 --> 55:36.340
slash unplugs where you go to support this show Linux Azure AWS open stack

55:36.340 --> 55:39.180
dev ops they have great courseware on all of it

55:39.180 --> 55:43.300
Linux Academy is constantly improving their courseware the existing library

55:43.300 --> 55:48.100
library and all the new stuff super fast they have a great staff now working on

55:48.100 --> 55:51.580
all of this a great community full of Jupiter broadcasting members and

55:51.580 --> 55:56.980
instructor mentoring when you need it they got on-demand servers that spin up

55:56.980 --> 56:00.100
with the courseware that match the distribution you've chosen from they

56:00.100 --> 56:04.340
have availability availability planners that are just the perfect touch when

56:04.340 --> 56:09.300
you're super busy and last but not least one of my favorite things about Linux

56:09.300 --> 56:13.820
Academy is they put you in a hands-on real-world scenario so you get actual

56:13.820 --> 56:18.340
experience which there's nothing nothing that gives you more confidence when you

56:18.340 --> 56:22.100
go to take the test or when you're just trying to improve your skill set check

56:22.100 --> 56:26.060
out all the different features go to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged also

56:26.060 --> 56:31.380
did you know they have a blog they have one of their new content creators Terry

56:31.380 --> 56:36.620
Cox is sharing his experience working at Linux Academy yeah which is very

56:36.620 --> 56:40.060
interesting and you kind of see some of the passion behind it Linux Academy

56:40.060 --> 56:44.460
comm slash unplugged go there to learn more and to level up your skill set

56:44.460 --> 56:47.740
Linux Linux Academy thanks guys for sponsoring the unplugged program and

56:47.740 --> 56:51.860
that's the Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

56:51.860 --> 57:04.340
okay all right Wes were you or were you not successful in setting up the star

57:04.340 --> 57:11.780
bound server I believe so I've only just got the client installed and I'm a

57:11.780 --> 57:14.780
little confused on how to point it at the dedicated service so I there's that

57:14.780 --> 57:18.800
problem you have it as well I do I have starbound installed I yeah I think so I

57:18.800 --> 57:23.100
think I have it on this machine yes I do oh so there's a home I see I see

57:23.100 --> 57:25.820
there's a separate server they got installed when I download this from good

57:25.820 --> 57:31.220
old games let's see here Wes checking in now well do I just join a game maybe you

57:31.220 --> 57:35.700
know I'm well I was trying to start one as well so I have a character oh yeah

57:35.700 --> 57:39.380
it's got a server address you have to create a character first okay I see so

57:39.380 --> 57:44.780
maybe what you need to do yeah so create a character hmm cuz do we do we want to

57:44.780 --> 57:47.140
give out that address because once we give it out people gonna be playing on

57:47.140 --> 57:50.620
it that's fine you think I mean we can always tear it down when we and move it

57:50.620 --> 57:53.700
yeah okay so chat room if you want to test it I'm gonna give out the server

57:53.700 --> 57:59.100
info with okay so how do I where do I where'd you get that server info well so

57:59.100 --> 58:02.580
I already have a character so I'm a different okay so I went to join game at

58:02.580 --> 58:06.460
the front at the front page okay and then I checked Stark bold or star ball

58:06.460 --> 58:09.820
or star K bolt whatever it is and then it just brings up the server info after

58:09.820 --> 58:15.780
I select my character oh yeah okay all right so the server is starbound dot

58:15.780 --> 58:21.100
noble pain calm and it's port two one zero two five I'm gonna paste that in

58:21.100 --> 58:25.220
the chat room to noble pain but you have to have accounts I don't know how does

58:25.220 --> 58:28.260
that work oh well we'll have the chat room tested for us so I'll put it I'll

58:28.260 --> 58:30.700
drop it in there because I want to play with some folks I think that I do too

58:30.700 --> 58:38.140
what yeah yeah I mean it's the binaries totally running okay so good job West I

58:38.140 --> 58:40.860
mean if you got the binary running you're probably pretty close so nicely

58:40.860 --> 58:45.420
done sir well done under pressure too I think that's pretty great I'm pasting it

58:45.420 --> 58:50.260
now in the chat room so I had a topic while people are trying that out that I

58:50.260 --> 58:54.260
wanted to throw at you guys I'm so excited I just want to play the game now

58:54.260 --> 58:59.940
I was noticing that the EU is gonna be auditing a couple of open source

58:59.940 --> 59:05.060
projects that some of us may be familiar with the key pass project is one of them

59:05.060 --> 59:12.060
and I think also I think also the Apache web server is gonna be audited and when

59:12.060 --> 59:17.460
SCPs being audited and I think I think VLC I think there's a somewhat there's

59:17.460 --> 59:21.780
some other projects are getting audited in all of this here's the background the

59:21.780 --> 59:24.060
European Union just announced that it will give the source code of the

59:24.060 --> 59:27.700
password manager key pass and the Apache web server a security audit the idea is

59:27.700 --> 59:31.620
to audit the open source code and then it started around December of 2014 when

59:31.620 --> 59:35.940
two members of the European Parliament suggest an audit for free software used

59:35.940 --> 59:40.500
by EU institutions all right that seems like you know anytime we want to audit

59:40.500 --> 59:43.980
something we rely on I'm all I'm all aboard that train put me on there and

59:43.980 --> 59:49.780
take me to out of town so I started thinking what if the EU came to us

59:49.780 --> 59:59.780
Linux unplugged show okay guys sat down with us and it said to us no no it said

59:59.780 --> 01:00:04.260
to us we're gonna give you a million dollars and you can spend this on

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:08.740
auditing an open source project or two of your choice so we have a limited

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:14.140
budget to work with and we have to be responsible and how we spend it how and

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:17.900
what projects I guess is the better question which projects would we choose

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:22.100
how would we spend it and I wanted to kick it off so I was kicking this or

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:26.700
ww all right ww I'll answer my I'll go less ww what was your idea how would you

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:30.460
audit what would you audit how would you spend the money I would spend the money

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:39.580
to audit I see Linux oh to see if the NSA put a backdoor in there if you're a

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:44.980
security district you need to be audited you need to be known is this secure or

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:51.900
not and then maybe you know publish that information or use part of the money to

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:57.820
to audit it and make sure it's done right and throw and just and then just

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:02.780
publish information this is what we found or we didn't find you know so this

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:09.980
can be trusted for now because it could all something can always change so yeah

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:13.100
I was trying to think too would I wanted when I want to audit something like

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.860
telegram or something like Firefox and I don't think so I think I'd want to go

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:20.860
myself I want to go more infrastructure I think if I was gonna pick a project it

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:24.900
would be something that I rely on and think of as secure something like open

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:31.020
VPN or open SSH right I would love to get a real good so although open SSH has a

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:36.100
lot of eyes on it and maybe open VPN does too but the other thing that would

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:41.500
sort of crop up on my radar and I don't know how feasible this would be and it's

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.700
not like it hasn't it's not getting looked at all the time but I am just not

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:48.060
a hundred percent solid on tour and they've been a lot of changes in a lot

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:52.020
of news recently mm-hmm mm-hmm there's been a lot of attacks against or there's

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:55.980
been a lot of changes in the board just like true crypt I would love to have

01:01:55.980 --> 01:02:00.060
more eyes on tour yes from a from a third-party auditing a lot of a wire

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:05.060
guard yeah that would be good to get done right away yeah yeah wire garden

01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:10.300
tink too really that would be good yeah that is such great performance though

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:13.860
it's awesome oh wimpy you have a great one which one

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:20.460
gnu g yeah yeah yeah yeah that's one we all rely upon we've been we've been told

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:25.300
by folks like Snowden that it's solid but I mean who know really knows you I

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:30.500
not to be paranoid but there are if you listen to text now I mean it's we talk

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.500
about it quite a bit there are entire industries now around finding these

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:37.340
problems and selling them and they have they have like Silk Road type markets

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:43.020
where a vulnerabilities go for certain prices in Bitcoin and whatnot in Bitcoin

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:47.420
and what's not it really well yeah it really is it really is a growing market

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:50.260
where people are finding these things and holding on to it and and then there's

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:54.700
people out there that know about vulnerabilities and then sell them and so

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:57.300
it these kinds of things I don't know they just freaked me out doesn't have to

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.420
be an NSA conspiracy theory where the NSA is hacking you it could just

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.860
literally be some jerk hacker who figured something out and like you know

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:07.940
yeah and like part of the benefit of it being open and you know it's it's kind

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:10.900
of everyone and so like if we can all take responsibility get things audited

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:15.380
and have a really solid base to build from you think it's worth auditing like

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:20.100
desktop environments like the gnome desktop or plasma desktop you think it's

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.980
worth that or is it just really rely on the enterprise case yeah and but you'd

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:27.300
have to be careful about versions right you have to pick like a fixed point and

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:33.580
yeah yeah and then somebody in the chat room suggested snaps and snap D it's

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:37.900
probably not bad I maybe app armor too yeah good one

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:41.060
Rekai yeah app armor is not bad anybody else in the mom room having suggestions

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:44.900
before we wrap up yeah if we're gonna be her line not more and more here right

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:50.380
yeah yeah yeah x11 well I think that'd be depressing Wayland way to be bad way

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:53.820
with Waylander mirror yeah that wouldn't be bad yeah I'd say go for the

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:57.140
infrastructure stuff and Wayland would know not jb titles don't look there

01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:01.220
don't look there it makes j-bot grumpy continuing the audit of let's encrypt I

01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:06.940
think is happening or veracrypt yeah that's a good one wimpy free BSD oh oh

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:14.860
oh yeah you know they had to remove the Linux subsystem that was open

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:21.020
BSD yeah so open BSD then yeah okay good let's do that one yeah there they they

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:25.420
they talk a big game let's see how they do open SSL I think that's happening all

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:28.740
the time these days arch Linux I think that's happy you know Google has a

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:31.540
project called project zero where they're literally going in investigating

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.000
different projects recently though they've been really beating up on

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.620
antivirus companies it's been it's been really fun to watch yeah okay well if

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.020
you have any suggestions I'd like to hear your thoughts Linux action show at

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.140
reddit.com or leave a YouTube comment if you're watching on YouTube what open

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:47.140
source project would you audit because I have a sense we're probably forgetting

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:51.740
of some because we just kind of came up it's not everybody yeah but on the spot

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:55.780
my my attack would be infrastructure and then go out from there wouldn't it be

01:04:55.780 --> 01:05:02.220
amazing I honestly if there was some sort of perpetual crowdfunding platform

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:06.980
for security auditing and not I don't think patreon will be and I don't think

01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:09.540
Kickstarter or gofundme or anything like that there's some sort of different

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:13.300
something different where I could kick into from time to time and say I want to

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:17.100
help and then do you remember the infrastructure project that the Linux

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:21.500
Foundation set up if so if they if they ran something like that if it came from

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:26.220
it if it came from a from a foundation like that or a group of people that were

01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:28.740
organizing and hiring the right professionals for the right tools and

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:31.480
the right jobs and being very transparent about how they spend the

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.740
money and the reported man that'd be such a perfect companion to open source

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:38.060
security is to have a Linux Foundation or somebody like that organized

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:41.380
something like that and I would love to contribute to something like that I

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:45.940
wouldn't be able to contribute a lot but I absolutely would love to you know I

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.700
don't know if you guys have ideas let us know you can also go to the contact page

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:52.580
at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact that's where we get that

01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:55.540
business done that's our official contact page although really to be

01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:58.660
honest with you for this show I it is more of a community experience well

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:01.780
that's kind of where the subreddit comes in probably a little more and also we

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:06.820
have the mumble room and the IRC don't forget them no I can I'm looking at them

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.980
right now we always stare right at their face you can find out when we do all

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:13.100
those things at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash counter it'll convert that

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:17.140
lifetime to your local time zone then you go to jblive.tv you plug that into

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.700
your machine of choice and join the IRC and then from there bang mumble you get

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:25.020
our mumble secrets you hang out in our community our virtual lugs always

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:28.260
willing and accepting as long as your microphone works and you don't got echo

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:33.180
yeah oh yeah knock that off no it's action shot at reddit.com is where you go

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:37.140
to leave feedback and topic ideas thanks so much for tuning this week's

01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:42.620
episode of the unplugged program we'll see you right back here next week

01:06:42.620 --> 01:07:09.500
you did it Wes you did it I'm impressed hello everybody I didn't know if you

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.980
better get going now do we have anybody connected though yeah I mean I see Rekai

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:17.300
right here he's on there are you in the game oh yeah I'm right I'm in the game

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:26.500
where are you Chris that's the question starbound doctor during the show I like

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:30.140
your I like that you got your name I well you got your online name I should

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:37.900
do I have Wes Payne too I wonder if I could get my name let's just say I have

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:41.020
a little too many variants of my own so do I have it do I just put anything in

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:44.460
there for the server just leave it blank oh man I was supposed to put the port in

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.020
the actual they have a specified port box I didn't see that because I was

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:51.580
just putting it in there yeah JB titles calm JB titles calm if you guys want to

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.140
you if you don't want to buy this on steam to you can get on good old games

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:58.580
which is pretty cool I would love to mess around with this all right so

01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:03.820
assets mismatch between client and server and the override option is not

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:07.460
set oh I thought I did what does that mean what does that even mean is that

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:11.180
because I don't have the steam version oh is yours allow him can you edit your

01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:15.300
character how do I do that I think there was like an allow mismatch oh but maybe

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:20.180
that was the start game yeah cuz that just puts me back in my world this is no

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:24.740
good Wes this is no good well okay JB titles calm I boy I'm starting to

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:28.880
escape you need to update it is that why the assets are mismatched I have you

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.220
updated we're going to steam oh you have great games I could just go

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:35.660
redownload it I guess but that feels pretty old they need to snap this up

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:40.300
that's what they have to do snap it up okay guys well I want to say thank you

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.380
everybody for making it I really appreciate it that was really fun

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:46.000
wimpy to pick your brain all that stuff I find it fascinating and it's good to

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.900
hear a story you know from somebody who was there so that way it's not just our

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:54.660
speculation you're welcome thanks for inviting me on wimpy get snappy and so

01:08:54.660 --> 01:09:00.660
that's the top title right now oh geez oh man okay I have a question for you

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:05.980
guys I I would really like to consult with some folks that have some

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:13.940
multi-month long experience with sync thing mm-hmm I do what are some of the

01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:19.000
key tricks to getting like your discovery between sync thing nodes or

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.020
whatever it's called working and what are key things to know if you if you're

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:26.940
frequently reloading machines or setting up new machines and also if you want to

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:30.260
have a pretty sophisticated sync setup like I want to think a lot of things

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:34.260
between some machines but a couple of bits but some of those same machines I

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:37.740
want to sync with other computers only a couple of things like so complicated

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:43.700
setups like that what are like tips to make because I feel like here's every

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.940
here's my problem and I don't even know where I've gone wrong because I have

01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:51.140
it's been about six months or so but I I set up a sync thing instance I get two

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:56.020
or three systems going usually it's this machine here in studio my machine up in

01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:59.740
my office and a digital ocean droplet and I get those three things working and

01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:04.420
then at some point I reload one of them and I can never get that third that

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:08.260
reloaded machine to rejoin up or something like sometimes it can see them

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:13.460
but they can't see it we have fully working totally fine DNS here in the

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:19.260
studio yeah I don't really understand what keeps going wrong and so because

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:22.620
because I'm always doing it when I'm super busy and trying to solve a problem

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:26.180
and just get something working I never really spend a lot of time trying to

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:30.220
really figure out what I've gone what I've done wrong and it just it makes

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:34.340
there's there really that much of a difference between the 64-bit version and

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:42.020
the 32-bit oh file wise or something you mean like how many files it can do so

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:46.420
yeah okay I don't know arch that's a good question you're asking about a

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:51.620
array storage array right well no now I'm just asking about syncing best

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:55.300
practices in general to keep a good sync thing like to keep something that's

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:58.820
sustainable for me using sync thing I want to be able to I want to be able to

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.540
have confidence that I can blow machines away and re-add them to whatever my was

01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:05.660
it called a syncing syncing swarm what's that what is that called I don't know

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:14.900
network yeah nobody has any advice for me I've got one running on my phone it

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.700
sinks all my photos down and anything I do on my phone that I want to you know

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:20.740
be saved in my computers and backed up yeah that'd be good that'd be a perfect

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:24.220
use case like a box thinking that I've got a Linux box thinking that and I've

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:27.860
got a server in my data center sinking that and so when you want to when you

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:32.220
want to add your phone what steps did you follow um I just opened all the web

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:36.100
you eyes and all the machines plugged in actually on the phone I did the QR code

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:39.740
thing so like I'd share the QR code from the other machines snap the QR code it

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.260
got all the information so I didn't type it all out so when you add a new

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:47.180
computer to an existing sync setup you go to both computers administrative

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:50.460
interface and you add each that you add each other to it right you have to add

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:55.420
each other yeah because they both have to recognize your public key yeah

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:59.140
sometimes you can just add it one way and then the other will start trying to

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.940
talk to your new node and it will say like do you want to add this guy who's

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:06.380
trying to talk to you like yeah based on this I have seen that sometimes yeah

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.420
okay but I would say yeah it does like but I would just add them on both yeah

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:13.740
add them especially for the links that you really care about okay okay yep I

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:17.060
will also say I've that's what I usually have done but sometimes like I want to

01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.820
add them on each end like one of them will connect but the other one won't or

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:22.660
something typically what I do is I have it they all connect to the server but

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:26.460
none connect to each other in between how do you define which ones the server

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:30.540
down you just don't allow them to discover each other there's like an

01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:35.780
option that advertises neighbor nodes or something oh I try using that thing you

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:40.100
maybe it'll help okay no it might help you it should be fine but just the way I

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:43.940
do it is I have one server that they all connect to and they don't interconnect

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:47.740
between each other okay that seems to work for me I'm not saying that's the

01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:51.100
only solution it just seems to work well because the server has ports open that

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:55.780
are guaranteed and the IP address is static yeah I'll say in the kind of in

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:58.900
the same vein I've enjoyed using it when I was with tank for an overlay network

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:01.620
but you could use whatever really network just like you don't have to

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:05.140
worry about anything I was thinking it was tank would be a good use for that

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:08.060
or if you have a VPN set up already that'll add it to your home or the

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:16.060
studio network or you know well I feel that doesn't really make me feel much

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:18.460
better because you guys really haven't given me anything I haven't already done

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:22.220
yeah it does sound like maybe doing a little bit more manually not relying on

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:27.060
the it'd be nice if you could centrally manage the sinking of all those nodes if

01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:30.780
you have so many yeah that would be having to set them up on each node is

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:34.180
really frustrating and time-consuming and tedious yeah really the one thing it

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:39.580
really right now needs the tool to yeah that does burn yeah that does burn me

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:44.860
okay so Ben Ben Fitzpatrick is in the mumble room Ben was our feedback

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.420
question who was also our aborted runs Linux for the Linux action show this

01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:54.940
Sunday what's the what's the update there been well last night my friend

01:13:54.940 --> 01:14:02.860
Jamie came by and we I did manage to get arch running on my pro book that I was

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:10.360
showing you guys and I tell you what the problem was was I believe it or not had

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:15.140
a triple boot setup going on and what happened was I had forgotten to write

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:22.620
grub into the EFI boot so oh my god so the whole time was rub was not writing

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:27.740
to the EFI partition probably so I found the command on the arch wiki and then

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:34.500
bang it just started booting after I ran it from the from the EFI boot menu and

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:40.660
then voila I was in and I got XFC loading awesome everything and it's all sorted

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.940
so yeah and then my friend Jamie came by and fixed awesome up for me and

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:49.900
everything's all good so yeah and it looks really killer and congrats man

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:53.060
that's awesome so did you go straight up arch or did you go with an arch

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:57.900
derivative or what was your approach there was normal arch via architect and

01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:02.780
I gotta tell you okay architect is not being maintained anymore yeah it still

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:09.300
works and I tell you it's it's really very simple even if you're a new user

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:13.580
and you haven't used arch before it really simplifies things down to the

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:18.920
minimum and I've done stock arch before and architect makes it a walk in the

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:23.300
frickin park so cool that's the way to stick with it man good for you I plan to

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:28.900
and I tell you this thing really saved my neck are you enjoying any of the

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.860
process I mean I know there's like ups and downs with it but have you found it

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:36.660
just like intellectually enjoyable yes and I tell you I've actually wiped my

01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:47.460
windows I'm actually considering dumping OS X on my macbook even and throwing

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:51.060
archon highly recommended well I don't know about on the macbook but go give it

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:54.740
a go and let it report back and let us know how it goes I will thank you oh

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:59.660
man so okay this made my heart sink I just saw this go by the chat room wimpy

01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:05.340
says that he abandoned his sink thing set up uh-huh well okay wimpy I feel

01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:10.540
like this is gonna be I feel like this is gonna be what convinces me not to use

01:16:10.540 --> 01:16:14.260
sink thing because I think a wimpy and I have seen I die on this stuff before so

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:17.780
do you want to tell us what happened you know all those things you just explained

01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:24.700
you were trying to get fixed yeah I couldn't fix it oh so it runs along just

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:29.380
fine until you need to change something right is that what kind of your yeah that

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:34.580
the problem I had is that even though there are mechanisms to support key

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:39.640
exchange with multiple devices that just wasn't happening seamlessly and for the

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:44.080
number of machines I have that was a real showstopper so I did things to

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:50.620
tweak the speed at which it would pick up changes but yeah just it just wasn't

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:55.260
working for me and I was bored with keep on trying to poke it and make it go so I

01:16:55.260 --> 01:17:04.140
just gave up are you using something else in place or well not really I mean

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:09.500
I had this one use case left which was my dot five talked to get in the past

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:14.020
about roaming profiles and how I was using that just keep all of those dot

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:17.100
files and everything that was in my profile sync across of the machines

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:21.420
which is why I use it on so many machines because I was using it on all

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:25.180
the servers that I you you know my own personal servers and my workstations and

01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:31.380
laptops and what have you so I've I use the same tool to manage the dot file sim

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:35.700
linking which is a tool called makeup but now I've just got it hooked into a

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:39.660
get back end because I can't be doing with sync thing messing me about you

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:44.300
know it almost makes me want to throw next cloud on something with just a ton

01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:48.460
of desk because really where my own cloud sync issues have gone wrong is

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:53.700
when own cloud has tried to do something clever like keep a duplicate copy so I

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:57.460
could undelete and then runs out of storage because the undelete bin takes

01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:01.380
up all my space and when I'm working with unfiltered clips and it's you know

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:04.500
multi gigs per episode that happens within a couple of months even with

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:08.460
tons and tons of storage but if I really you know if I had a lot of storage

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:12.820
sitting behind it what I really like about the next cloud syncing paradigm is

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:19.900
it very is very close to the Dropbox one where I install a client I log in to the

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:23.020
client now in the case of next cloud I pointed to my server I don't do that

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:27.700
with Dropbox but I log in and it begins sinking and it begins just

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:31.340
participating in the sink swarm without having to discover servers that having

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:36.300
to exchange keys and the thing is that's pretty nice for me because any given

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:40.060
week I've reloaded a machine for a show and I have to sync several hundred

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:43.700
assets to that machine and so I'm not always in the same place when I'm

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:48.220
setting them up yeah so maybe next cloud will solve this for me but in the

01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:56.260
meantime dropbox enterprise is like super crazy expensive so I'm ready to

01:18:56.260 --> 01:19:03.700
just dump it as soon as possible but yeah yeah last time I used own cloud was

01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:10.620
own cloud 8 and I'm gonna have a go with next cloud and the other one that I had

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:17.140
some good success with was C file which is what next cloud is using isn't it

01:19:17.140 --> 01:19:24.420
under or is it CC I think no yeah that CCC file is right SSEA file right see

01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:29.980
yes right and the only thing that puts me off that is um I really don't want to

01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:46.820
be adminning loads of servers in my spare time because yeah
