WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:04.520
You know, well, hmm, okay.

00:04.520 --> 00:06.160
You sound unsure, Chris.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.480
Don't tell those jerks over at the Linux Action Show,

00:08.480 --> 00:10.200
but I think I'm gonna steal one of their Runs Linux.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.480
Let's spot the Runs Linux.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.300
Are you ready, Runs?

00:12.300 --> 00:13.840
Unset in D minus five minutes.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.640
To do something as ambitious as making a car drive itself,

00:21.640 --> 00:24.040
you need lots of testing and lots of places

00:24.040 --> 00:25.700
so that you can cover all the scenarios

00:25.700 --> 00:27.440
you might ever expect to see.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.800
All right, so a couple of interesting things about this.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.400
You notice there's not a whole bunch of cameras

00:31.400 --> 00:33.320
hanging off this car here.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.280
And, you know, one of the things I have honestly wondered,

00:35.280 --> 00:36.940
and I know they use LiDAR to some extent,

00:36.940 --> 00:39.040
but how well do the Google self-driving cars

00:39.040 --> 00:41.440
work in the dark with no lights?

00:41.440 --> 00:42.480
I've wondered about that.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.960
And, you know, so far, all of these self-driving cars

00:44.960 --> 00:48.240
seem to run Linux, but I bet we spot some in this one.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.800
It's my kind of bet.

00:51.800 --> 00:52.840
NVG check.

00:54.040 --> 00:57.320
So they're putting on helmets with cameras.

00:57.320 --> 01:00.160
Fusion Niner One Two, prepare to go dark.

01:00.160 --> 01:04.280
They're covering the steering dash column stuff with a...

01:04.280 --> 01:07.040
Fusion Niner One Two, are all personnel in place?

01:07.040 --> 01:07.880
Some sort of blackout.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.200
This is Gold Leader, I'm in position.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.280
Okay, you ready, Wes?

01:12.000 --> 01:15.200
Fusion Niner One Two, could we get a systems check, please?

01:15.200 --> 01:16.040
These guys.

01:16.040 --> 01:16.880
LiDAR is go.

01:16.880 --> 01:17.700
LiDAR is go.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.000
IMU is go.

01:19.000 --> 01:19.960
Radar is go.

01:19.960 --> 01:20.800
Camera is go.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.480
All systems are functioning.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.800
We are ready to go at once.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.320
Oh, look at that.

01:25.320 --> 01:28.160
Wow, wow, we are getting a lot of stuff here.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.800
So they're using the system sentry log message interface.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.360
Don't reckon that's probably something to them.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.680
But over here, I'm noticing Wireshark over here.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.480
MBV player, there's Java, there's hardware info,

01:38.480 --> 01:42.160
VLC, screen capture program.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.640
They have a update manager running in the background.

01:44.640 --> 01:49.000
Wow, look at all that stuff on that Linux box.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.080
They're just like you, they do updates

01:50.080 --> 01:51.080
right before they have to do something.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.280
Yeah, they totally are, aren't they?

01:53.280 --> 01:56.680
All right, guys, we're gonna go.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.500
Now watch this.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.120
We are autonomous.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.800
They're using a camera that captures the LiDAR lasers.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.640
That's awesome.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.000
Or whatever, I guess it's not lasers or whatever.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.180
It's whatever, oh no, I guess it would be.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.600
But look at that, look how it blankets the area,

02:09.600 --> 02:10.880
surveying the ground as they say.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.000
It's an odd feeling to be looking at the viewer

02:13.000 --> 02:15.360
and seeing exactly what I expected.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.840
But as soon as I looked out the window,

02:16.840 --> 02:18.760
all I saw was blackness.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.520
Through the S's again, everything is stable.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.640
That was Linux again there.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.240
It's breaking into the hairpin.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.600
And accelerating out of the corner.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.040
Pull back in here, complete the mission,

02:29.040 --> 02:31.840
and then we'll restart again just to do it on the full lap.

02:35.120 --> 02:35.960
It's going good.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.720
Car is functioning just as it should.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.600
Car is driving by itself in the middle of the night.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.360
You know, I have yet to see one of these

02:47.360 --> 02:48.940
that isn't powered by Linux.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.960
And isn't that something, Wes?

02:50.960 --> 02:51.800
Yeah, that is something.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.280
Because this is going to be a huge deal.

02:53.280 --> 02:56.240
This is going to change our culture forever.

02:56.240 --> 02:59.400
This is how they should have made the, what is it, Kinect.

02:59.400 --> 03:02.180
Because Kinect shows a bunch of dots in infrared

03:02.180 --> 03:05.720
and maps the depth perception throughout the room.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.760
This is doing it in a 3D area.

03:07.760 --> 03:10.040
This is how Kinect should have been.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.000
And they're using Linux end to end.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.680
They're using Linux in the computer in the car.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.680
They're using Linux for the reviewing of the data.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.320
And then when they were playing back the 3D map

03:18.320 --> 03:20.440
of the thing driving, they're using Linux.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.240
End to end, using Linux to create something

03:22.240 --> 03:23.960
that's going to fundamentally change the world.

03:23.960 --> 03:27.800
And probably kill the podcasting audience

03:27.800 --> 03:30.840
because people won't be sitting in traffic anymore.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.920
Dang it.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.920
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 140 for April 12th, 2016.

03:36.920 --> 03:51.740
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

03:51.740 --> 03:55.140
that didn't force Wes to reload his laptop this week.

03:55.140 --> 03:56.060
My name is Chris.

03:56.060 --> 03:56.900
My name is Wes.

03:56.900 --> 03:57.740
Hey there, Wes.

03:57.740 --> 04:00.620
I think this is like the first week in like five episodes.

04:00.620 --> 04:01.540
I think so.

04:01.540 --> 04:03.420
I'm still running apricity.

04:03.420 --> 04:04.460
How's it going over there?

04:04.460 --> 04:05.280
Not bad.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.120
Nice.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.900
It's like you get to just enjoy it for a little while.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.340
Maybe install some things I forget from the episode.

04:11.340 --> 04:12.860
I bet we'll break it next week.

04:12.860 --> 04:14.500
There's going to be something we'll have to try out.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.180
But this week we have a huge show.

04:17.180 --> 04:19.420
We have so much stuff to get into.

04:19.420 --> 04:22.620
We have an interesting follow up from something

04:22.620 --> 04:27.180
that happened about 106 weeks ago in Unplugged history.

04:27.180 --> 04:29.660
We'll get to that coming up a little bit in the show.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.580
I went and installed myself a tracker

04:32.580 --> 04:34.940
so I could track myself as I move about the world.

04:34.940 --> 04:37.100
Not on Google, in my own cloud.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.340
Something I wanted to use for Lady Joops

04:39.340 --> 04:42.780
as we take the rover over to pick up Mr. Ham radio.

04:42.780 --> 04:45.100
So I installed the open source track car server.

04:45.100 --> 04:46.980
And I'll give you my experiences with setting up

04:46.980 --> 04:49.340
a tracker that uses your smartphone for yourself

04:49.340 --> 04:50.740
or whatever you need.

04:50.740 --> 04:52.540
For me, it's so you guys can follow me

04:52.540 --> 04:54.180
because why not be creepy.

04:54.180 --> 04:56.460
Also, we have some really big updates

04:56.460 --> 04:57.980
for some pretty important projects

04:57.980 --> 04:59.540
that we've been following.

04:59.540 --> 05:01.300
Some interesting Scuttlebutt and news,

05:01.300 --> 05:04.980
as well as a quick Linux Fest Northwest update

05:04.980 --> 05:06.820
coming up towards the end of the show.

05:06.820 --> 05:08.540
It is a bunch of stuff to get into, Wes.

05:08.540 --> 05:11.580
So we should probably start with my favorite thing.

05:12.540 --> 05:16.080
One of my, I think, one of my favorite beers

05:16.080 --> 05:17.900
probably in the last couple of weeks, maybe.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.460
Yeah, I mean you've been bringing

05:19.460 --> 05:20.580
some really good local brews.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.480
Another brewed in Seattle beer.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.860
Now this one stands out because it's gluten-free.

05:24.860 --> 05:25.980
That's right, no gluten here.

05:25.980 --> 05:27.140
Which you didn't even realize.

05:27.140 --> 05:28.820
And also, on the bottle they want you

05:28.820 --> 05:29.860
to transcend your limits.

05:29.860 --> 05:30.700
That stands out.

05:30.700 --> 05:31.540
Do you do that every week here?

05:31.540 --> 05:32.500
Yeah, we do, we do.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.500
So it's Ghost Fish Brewing Company we're drinking this week

05:35.500 --> 05:37.900
and maybe some of you in our virtual log will be as well.

05:37.900 --> 05:39.540
And how do you suppose, I was gonna say,

05:39.540 --> 05:40.380
how do you suppose, Wes,

05:40.380 --> 05:44.300
but I was gonna say, watchstander.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.740
I believe so, watchstander stout.

05:45.740 --> 05:47.080
Yeah, I like that, the watchstander stout.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.620
We got a pint here, we'll be drinking on the show.

05:49.620 --> 05:52.380
An additional six fluid ounces after that one pint,

05:52.380 --> 05:53.220
six fluid ounces.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.300
Oh, you're right, I didn't even see that.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.340
I had my thumb right there.

05:55.340 --> 05:58.180
So thanks, Wes, these are some nice brewskis.

05:58.180 --> 05:59.020
I'm glad you enjoy it.

05:59.020 --> 05:59.840
We'll be enjoying them.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.820
So let's get into some of the updates for the week.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.460
Let's bring in our virtual log first.

06:03.460 --> 06:05.720
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

06:05.720 --> 06:09.180
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.

06:09.180 --> 06:13.280
It is good to see all of you, or at least, well, hear you.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.320
One of the stories that people seem to be kind of jacked up

06:15.320 --> 06:18.180
about today is, well, it's a Valve story.

06:18.180 --> 06:19.380
We're gonna do a little Valve update right here

06:19.380 --> 06:20.780
at the top of the show.

06:20.780 --> 06:25.740
An open source driver, an open source contender has emerged,

06:25.740 --> 06:28.300
at least early development has, for the Steam Controller.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.580
You might not have realized this,

06:29.580 --> 06:32.300
but to get the actual full Steam Controller driver

06:32.300 --> 06:35.220
on your rig, on your Linux rig,

06:35.220 --> 06:36.700
you had to have Steam installed.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.420
You had to have, you had to have all the Steam installed.

06:39.420 --> 06:40.260
Yeah, and so-

06:40.260 --> 06:41.700
It's not very Linux-y.

06:41.700 --> 06:44.700
The final purpose is to have a custom mapping ability

06:44.700 --> 06:47.780
created for this controller, also some others.

06:47.780 --> 06:50.580
The initial target is for GNU slash Linux,

06:50.580 --> 06:54.420
but there are welcoming contributors to port it to.

06:54.420 --> 06:56.340
Ox, what is this, Ox 10?

06:56.340 --> 07:01.260
No, Os 10, Windows, BSD, or even perhaps Android.

07:01.260 --> 07:02.300
Whoa.

07:02.300 --> 07:04.300
Android, I think, would be really awesome to have.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.840
Yeah. Yeah.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.060
So there you go.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.000
You have to check it out.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.860
It's on GitHub right now if you want it,

07:09.860 --> 07:13.180
but it will mess up your current driver if you do load it.

07:13.180 --> 07:14.020
What do you think, Wes?

07:14.020 --> 07:14.860
Is this important?

07:14.860 --> 07:16.100
Rodden Corp seems to think so.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.900
Why do you, what do you think?

07:17.900 --> 07:19.980
Yeah, I mean, it seems like good hardware.

07:19.980 --> 07:21.380
We already enjoy good support for things

07:21.380 --> 07:23.960
like the Xbox 360 controller.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.900
I'm sure people want to use this with weird niche games

07:25.900 --> 07:27.620
or games that really have no place on Steam

07:27.620 --> 07:28.580
or don't support Steam,

07:28.580 --> 07:30.340
or for gamers that just don't want to have anything

07:30.340 --> 07:32.260
to do with Steam, but enjoy the hardware.

07:32.260 --> 07:36.880
Yeah, I could definitely see it also as a pretty cool,

07:36.880 --> 07:38.580
a pretty cool, like, just as an example,

07:38.580 --> 07:39.660
something we were talking about before the show,

07:39.660 --> 07:42.420
is if you just had a standard open source driver,

07:42.420 --> 07:44.460
then maybe you could integrate it

07:44.460 --> 07:46.220
with other kinds of open source projects,

07:46.220 --> 07:47.060
and all of a sudden you could have

07:47.060 --> 07:48.700
a really cool controller for those.

07:48.700 --> 07:49.740
Who knows what those could be?

07:49.740 --> 07:51.820
Maybe it could be something to brew beer.

07:51.820 --> 07:53.640
Speaking of the Valve,

07:53.640 --> 07:58.640
we talked about this itch app store on Linux Action Show.

07:58.680 --> 07:59.520
That's right.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.640
Yeah, it's already been pulled.

08:00.640 --> 08:01.480
They pulled it. Of course.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.320
So quick update on that.

08:02.320 --> 08:07.320
Yeah, Valve has pulled the itch or itch.io desktop app.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.760
It was in violation of their terms and service.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.480
So there's a quick one there,

08:11.480 --> 08:14.840
and they were clear about what categories they do allow in,

08:14.840 --> 08:18.520
and your own frickin' app store is not one of them.

08:18.520 --> 08:21.080
So sorry, guys, sorry about that.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.320
Now, that was sort of just a real quick update.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.580
That ends our Valve section of the show.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.400
And now it brings our Richard Stallman section of the show.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.560
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

08:32.560 --> 08:34.320
Into the focus. Your favorite.

08:34.320 --> 08:35.840
Yeah, it is.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.760
So Richard Stallman has spoken out about

08:38.760 --> 08:41.740
Popey's attempt to get ZFS working on Linux.

08:41.740 --> 08:44.400
And now, as we all know,

08:44.400 --> 08:46.760
Popey is personally involved in getting ZFS

08:46.760 --> 08:48.600
to run on Ubuntu 16.04,

08:48.600 --> 08:51.320
and is personally responsible for the legal fights

08:51.320 --> 08:53.320
that will be, I mean, we all know this.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.160
It's obvious.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.000
He's the one loading the kernel engine.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.020
He might downplay it.

08:56.020 --> 08:57.720
But remember, if he tries to downplay it, Wes,

08:57.720 --> 08:59.840
his denial is actually a confirmation.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.240
Absolutely.

09:01.240 --> 09:04.040
On advice of counsel, I decline to answer.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.120
Very well.

09:05.120 --> 09:09.340
So Richard Stallman has spoken out about ZFS,

09:09.340 --> 09:12.560
as Mr. Jude would say, shipping on Ubuntu.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.400
And he said,

09:13.400 --> 09:15.960
the code under GPL incompatible licenses cannot be added,

09:15.960 --> 09:17.760
neither in source nor binary form,

09:17.760 --> 09:20.380
without violating the GPL.

09:20.380 --> 09:23.120
If you distribute modules meant to be linked together

09:23.120 --> 09:26.480
by the user, you have made them into a combined work,

09:26.480 --> 09:29.440
and you must release the entire combined work

09:29.440 --> 09:31.840
under the GNU GPL.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.040
He says it's therefore impossible to release ZFS

09:34.040 --> 09:35.900
alongside the GNU GPL license code,

09:35.900 --> 09:39.100
because ZFS is licensed under the CCDL version one.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.500
And Richard Stallman points out,

09:41.500 --> 09:43.600
and the value of this is negative,

09:43.600 --> 09:47.800
that Oracle could just simply relicense ZFS

09:47.800 --> 09:50.400
under the GPL and solve everybody's problem.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.100
It would make it possible to combine that version

09:52.100 --> 09:54.440
with Linux without violating the license of Linux.

09:54.440 --> 09:55.880
This would be the ideal resolution,

09:55.880 --> 09:59.020
and we urge the copyright holders of ZFS to do this,

09:59.020 --> 09:59.860
is what he said.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.920
That ain't gonna happen ever.

10:02.920 --> 10:04.840
No, no.

10:04.840 --> 10:09.040
No, have you noticed that both the Software Conservancy

10:09.040 --> 10:11.160
and now the Free Software Foundation

10:11.160 --> 10:15.100
are taking this tact of, well, it's not Canonical's fault,

10:15.100 --> 10:17.560
and it's not the GPL's fault,

10:17.560 --> 10:19.240
it's Oracle's fault.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.280
To me, that seems, and I'll ask you, Wimpy,

10:21.280 --> 10:24.800
what you think of that, but that seems ridiculous,

10:24.800 --> 10:26.400
because what you're doing is, hey,

10:26.400 --> 10:29.060
that thing that you made and you own,

10:29.060 --> 10:32.400
I want it so bad that I think you should change it to this.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.680
That seems like a childish argument.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.200
And Oracle didn't make it either.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.320
They acquired it from Sun Microsystems,

10:38.320 --> 10:40.380
and they acquired the license it was under.

10:40.380 --> 10:43.600
So, you know, I'm no fan of Oracle,

10:43.600 --> 10:44.840
quite the opposite in fact,

10:44.840 --> 10:48.600
but they are not at all motivated to change the licensing

10:48.600 --> 10:51.920
of ZFS, unless of course they want to start shipping it

10:51.920 --> 10:55.640
in their, do they call it unbreakable Linux or something?

10:55.640 --> 10:58.580
So the only time the license will change

10:58.580 --> 11:02.160
is if Oracle decide they want to ship it in their own.

11:02.160 --> 11:05.080
And haven't they, no, there was components of D-Trace

11:05.080 --> 11:06.760
that they've shipped in unbreakable.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.080
Oh, okay. Yeah.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.040
Which has sort of put some of this in question,

11:11.040 --> 11:13.320
and it'd be interesting to take that

11:13.320 --> 11:15.580
as a trial balloon and see what happens.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.320
But yeah, to me-

11:17.320 --> 11:20.760
If Oracle relicense it, it will be under some license

11:20.760 --> 11:22.280
that suits them and no one else.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.120
Exactly.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.040
Well, and they're not gonna do something

11:25.040 --> 11:28.560
I wouldn't think, I mean, maybe I'm wrong on this,

11:28.560 --> 11:31.600
but if they relicense ZFS to GPL,

11:31.600 --> 11:34.760
wouldn't that screw over the BSDs?

11:34.760 --> 11:35.920
Well, no, because they can fork it

11:35.920 --> 11:38.680
from the last CDL-licensed version, can't they?

11:38.680 --> 11:40.440
Not ideal though, is it?

11:40.440 --> 11:42.360
Well, no, not ideal.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.560
So they're not gonna do that.

11:43.560 --> 11:44.880
They're not gonna do that.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.280
Well, Oracle will do whatever they see fit

11:47.280 --> 11:50.400
without any regard for the BSD or the Linux community.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.240
Yeah.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.620
OS writer says that this is actually

11:55.620 --> 11:58.220
just a passive aggressive threat against canonical.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.140
I wonder if that's, I wonder if that's true.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.860
You know, they also, Mr. Mogen, even Eben,

12:06.860 --> 12:11.860
just wrote a really long piece on understanding

12:12.560 --> 12:16.520
the Linux Foundation's role in arbitrating these issues,

12:16.520 --> 12:18.600
basically saying it's not their role to do these.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.320
They did a good job of explaining their tax structure.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.880
Right, yeah, exactly.

12:22.880 --> 12:27.120
Yeah, and when I read that, to me it said

12:28.800 --> 12:33.280
that they're gonna make their own decision

12:33.280 --> 12:35.520
and take some sort of action.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.760
These two things are not being talked about

12:37.760 --> 12:39.420
in isolation, right?

12:39.420 --> 12:41.480
Eben is making this blog post.

12:41.480 --> 12:42.720
At the same time, Richard Stallman

12:42.720 --> 12:43.960
is making these statements,

12:43.960 --> 12:47.360
and within a short time after the software conservancy

12:47.360 --> 12:49.760
has made their statements,

12:49.760 --> 12:51.920
all of which are sort of like limp-handedly,

12:51.920 --> 12:53.240
sort of passively aggressively

12:53.240 --> 12:55.360
throwing some dirt on canonical,

12:55.360 --> 12:56.500
but most of them are trying to say,

12:56.500 --> 13:00.460
but it's really Oracle that's really the bad guy

13:00.460 --> 13:02.580
because everybody loves to hate Oracle, I think.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.760
But in this case, I mean, I'm no Oracle fan,

13:04.760 --> 13:09.760
but in this case, they now are the rightful owners of ZFS,

13:09.760 --> 13:13.780
and it seems strange to me that we have the nuts

13:13.780 --> 13:16.040
to just come up and say, well, we want it so much

13:16.040 --> 13:17.640
that you should have to do this thing,

13:17.640 --> 13:19.640
and that's the good guy thing to do.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.700
Well, no, it's not good or bad.

13:21.700 --> 13:22.800
It's their code.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.000
Right, they do have the right to do what that exactly is.

13:25.000 --> 13:25.960
Yeah, and you know what?

13:25.960 --> 13:28.160
They have chosen not to license it that way,

13:28.160 --> 13:30.580
and so we've made the clown shoe file system butter FS,

13:30.580 --> 13:32.760
which is, you know.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.000
At least it sounds like butter.

13:34.000 --> 13:34.840
It pales in comparison.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.200
Well, actually, they made it, oddly enough.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.040
Yeah, that's true, actually.

13:38.040 --> 13:38.880
True, very good point.

13:38.880 --> 13:41.320
Thank you, that is true, but yeah.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.320
But they got the license.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.160
Yeah.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.320
But as soon as they got ZFS, they dumped it, basically.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.280
Yeah, and now the community maintains a lot,

13:47.280 --> 13:48.960
and there's developers from a lot of large companies

13:48.960 --> 13:50.480
that now contribute code to it,

13:50.480 --> 13:51.360
which we've talked about before.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.880
Kitson, you wanted to make a point, though.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.040
Realizer's point's good, too,

13:54.040 --> 13:56.080
that it's different. Yeah.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.420
Do you think that RMS is just pitching a fit

13:58.420 --> 14:00.680
because he wants to have his absolute way

14:00.680 --> 14:03.300
and is unwilling to compromise about the issue,

14:03.300 --> 14:06.120
even though compromise is sometimes the best solution

14:06.120 --> 14:07.120
in the short term?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.140
Hmm.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.400
You know, well, he doesn't compromise.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.240
I will grant you that.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.080
When has he ever?

14:13.080 --> 14:13.900
Yeah.

14:13.900 --> 14:14.740
That's the thing he never has.

14:14.740 --> 14:15.560
But he's.

14:15.560 --> 14:16.400
So it makes sense that he wouldn't hear.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.360
I'm sure he gets tons of email about this,

14:18.360 --> 14:19.640
and so he has to release a statement

14:19.640 --> 14:21.240
so that people stop emailing him about it.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.400
I'm sure he does, too, actually.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.960
But the fact of the matter is it's,

14:25.960 --> 14:29.520
to me, his argument doesn't sound passionate.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.480
It sounds cold and legal.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.400
I mean, he's clearly quoting the confines

14:35.400 --> 14:39.320
of what the GPL code is allowed and not allowed to do,

14:39.320 --> 14:42.160
and he's not talking about crushing our freedom.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.120
He's not calling it the swindle.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.080
You know, he's saying you're just legally

14:46.080 --> 14:47.200
not allowed to do this thing.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.840
I mean, it sounds like a very cognizant argument.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.280
Right, it's not his usual rhetoric.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.320
It's not like he's okay with software piracy, right?

14:52.320 --> 14:53.160
Because that's kind of the same.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.560
Like, it's in a similar boat.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.620
You're doing something against

14:55.620 --> 14:57.440
Oracle's terms of their license.

14:57.440 --> 15:01.000
The difference here is that he's not talking

15:01.000 --> 15:03.040
about free software and non-free software.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.360
He's actually talking about

15:04.360 --> 15:07.560
two free software license bits of code

15:07.560 --> 15:10.840
and incompatibilities between those free software licenses.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.480
So there's really not much room for passion here

15:13.480 --> 15:16.120
because his passionate subject is being addressed.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.040
It's a legal issue now.

15:18.040 --> 15:18.880
That's a good way to put it.

15:18.880 --> 15:22.160
May I ask a question to clarify the issue?

15:22.160 --> 15:23.520
Mm-hmm, yeah.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.840
Okay, Poppy.

15:24.840 --> 15:29.460
Does the kernel module for ZFS

15:29.460 --> 15:32.240
actually contain ZFS code?

15:32.240 --> 15:35.000
Or is the issue having any similar

15:35.000 --> 15:38.380
compatible implementation of ZFS?

15:40.400 --> 15:41.240
Whose issue?

15:42.520 --> 15:46.440
Stallman's and this whole general hubbub about ZFS.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.200
The problem is mixing Cuddle code with GPL code

15:49.200 --> 15:50.500
and linking them together.

15:52.640 --> 15:53.480
Right.

15:53.480 --> 15:54.320
It has nothing to do with implementation.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.160
The kernel module.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.000
Or it does, I guess.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
The kernel code doesn't have any non-GPL code in it.

15:59.000 --> 15:59.840
That's not the issue.

15:59.840 --> 16:03.320
The issue is that fully GPLed kernel code

16:03.320 --> 16:06.120
connects to a binary blob.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.680
But as we've discussed before,

16:07.680 --> 16:08.960
boy, we are really getting to the weeds on this.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.960
Do we care that much about this?

16:10.960 --> 16:11.800
Final thoughts.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.560
Poppy, did you have any final thoughts

16:13.560 --> 16:15.000
on that question before we move on?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.040
No, it's one of those technical legal arguments

16:18.040 --> 16:20.680
where you have two people who have differing opinions

16:20.680 --> 16:22.680
and the only way to settle it is for one of them

16:22.680 --> 16:25.440
to take the other one to court, usually.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.920
We need the fun animation for this.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.920
You know, this is no different than any other

16:29.920 --> 16:31.040
legal disagreement.

16:31.040 --> 16:34.800
It's just the fact that it's all very public and out there.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.680
Because we're in this, these are personalities

16:37.680 --> 16:40.520
that we listen to and people align themselves

16:40.520 --> 16:41.440
with one side or the other.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.280
Yeah.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.100
Very well said.

16:43.100 --> 16:43.940
I would like to say, though.

16:43.940 --> 16:44.780
Yeah, go ahead.

16:45.640 --> 16:48.800
If RMS does want his license to stand up legally,

16:48.800 --> 16:50.740
he should try and defend it and make sure

16:50.740 --> 16:53.280
that it's legally enforced where possible.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.160
Why allow this one case, which may be against license,

16:56.160 --> 16:58.040
because then that allows all sorts of other cases

16:58.040 --> 16:58.880
in the future.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.680
If people want to just disagree with the license

17:00.680 --> 17:01.840
and do what they want.

17:03.280 --> 17:06.180
Well, we will continue to watch this.

17:06.180 --> 17:08.280
I don't want to spend too much time because I remember

17:08.280 --> 17:09.880
when I was new to Linux and I heard Linux users

17:09.880 --> 17:13.240
talking about this kind of crap, it just melted my head.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.200
I didn't care at all.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.920
And then later I realized why I should care,

17:15.920 --> 17:17.040
but it took me a while to get there

17:17.040 --> 17:18.560
and so I don't want to scare off people

17:18.560 --> 17:19.720
that are tuning in going,

17:19.720 --> 17:20.960
God, is this what these guys talk about?

17:20.960 --> 17:23.560
So I think we should probably move on,

17:23.560 --> 17:25.180
but it is interesting to follow.

17:25.180 --> 17:27.400
You know what else is a big public disappointment?

17:27.400 --> 17:30.040
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.680
The HTC Vive and Valve's Steam VR

17:32.680 --> 17:34.600
will not be getting Linux and SteamOS support

17:34.600 --> 17:37.160
at least, well, at least not anytime soon,

17:37.160 --> 17:39.240
which is a total go figure.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.600
I mean, a real bummer too,

17:40.600 --> 17:43.800
but just as a follow up to last week's episode,

17:43.800 --> 17:46.680
it doesn't look like they're gonna have SteamOS support,

17:46.680 --> 17:47.520
at least not for now.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.120
There's also been no official statement,

17:49.120 --> 17:51.800
so really, not much news.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.440
Chris takes a deep breath, he takes a deep breath.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.200
Do you think, Wes, this is,

17:56.200 --> 17:58.800
I mean, here's why I think it's a disappointment.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.880
If it requires something real crazy

18:00.880 --> 18:02.680
in the operating system, you're doing it wrong.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.240
It should be something I hook up to HDMI and USB

18:06.120 --> 18:09.600
and then it shows up as a display device

18:09.600 --> 18:11.400
and that should really be it.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.100
And I realize that this is sometimes

18:13.100 --> 18:15.280
not a super awesome area for Linux,

18:15.280 --> 18:17.720
multiple display devices and whatnot.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.000
Let me worry about that part.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.440
If you developers who get paid so much money

18:22.440 --> 18:24.240
and companies who are backed by Facebook

18:24.240 --> 18:26.840
worth billions just can't find it within yourself

18:26.840 --> 18:28.840
to learn how to use SDL properly,

18:28.840 --> 18:31.840
just release it and let the community work on it.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.440
For God's sakes, how many times

18:33.440 --> 18:35.080
do you have to be told this lesson?

18:35.080 --> 18:37.320
If you can't figure it out yourself,

18:37.320 --> 18:39.400
there's probably a community out there

18:39.400 --> 18:40.900
that is passionate enough to,

18:40.900 --> 18:42.960
yeah, especially when it's something hot like this.

18:42.960 --> 18:45.480
It just, it boggles the mind that companies

18:45.480 --> 18:48.820
still fail to figure this out in 2016.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.360
How many times do we have to learn this lesson

18:50.360 --> 18:51.720
and how many different industries

18:51.720 --> 18:53.360
have to figure this crap out?

18:53.360 --> 18:57.480
There's just nothing else to say, I suppose.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.760
All right, Wes, do you have any thoughts on that

18:59.760 --> 19:00.960
before we move on?

19:00.960 --> 19:02.440
Because I got something I got thoughts on.

19:02.440 --> 19:03.280
Are you ready?

19:03.280 --> 19:04.100
Are you ready?

19:04.100 --> 19:04.940
Are you ready?

19:04.940 --> 19:06.420
Because it's our friends over at DigitalOcean.

19:06.420 --> 19:07.760
That's right, DigitalOcean.com.

19:07.760 --> 19:09.120
Go there and check out DigitalOcean,

19:09.120 --> 19:11.240
sponsor of the Linux Unplugged program.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.380
You can get your own Linux rig up in that cloud

19:13.380 --> 19:15.760
like in no time, less than 55 seconds

19:15.760 --> 19:17.340
and for only $5 a month,

19:17.340 --> 19:19.800
you'll get a rig with 512 megabytes of RAM.

19:19.800 --> 19:20.800
Boom.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.800
A 20 gigabyte SSD, you know why, Wes?

19:22.800 --> 19:23.640
Because they all SSD.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.640
Yes, they are.

19:24.640 --> 19:25.520
Which, if you think about it,

19:25.520 --> 19:26.560
when DigitalOcean got started,

19:26.560 --> 19:28.180
that was kinda ballsy, I'm really impressed.

19:28.180 --> 19:30.560
They were brave, you know, they took command.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.400
They said, we're gonna go out there,

19:31.400 --> 19:33.000
we're gonna build the best servers with SSDs,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.840
with Linux, using KVM, tier one connections

19:35.840 --> 19:37.000
in our data centers.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.760
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, one word, lowercase,

19:40.760 --> 19:43.660
put it all together and get yourself a $10 credit.

19:43.660 --> 19:46.120
They got Ubuntu rigs, FreeBSD, Fedora, Debian,

19:46.120 --> 19:48.480
Core OS, CentOS, what's up?

19:48.480 --> 19:51.040
Of course they're gonna have 16.04 just about immediately.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.080
They've already got guides on how to set stuff up on it.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.000
They got data centers in New York, San Francisco,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.480
Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Germany.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.440
Have you seen those pictures, too?

19:58.440 --> 19:59.840
Their data centers are pretty.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.840
Dude, they are seriously pretty.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.160
Which is a weird thing to say, but they are.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.000
But they are.

20:05.000 --> 20:05.960
They are.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.680
The interface, though, also speaking of pretty,

20:07.680 --> 20:10.120
that interface, very nice interface

20:10.120 --> 20:11.320
that allows you to do simple things

20:11.320 --> 20:12.560
to very advanced things.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.800
With an HTML5 console, so you get access from post

20:14.800 --> 20:15.680
all the way to login.

20:15.680 --> 20:18.220
And DigitalOcean's got a few tricks up their sleeve.

20:18.220 --> 20:19.840
They launched early access to sign up

20:19.840 --> 20:21.160
for their new block storage service,

20:21.160 --> 20:23.160
which I am super stoked about.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.000
If you wanna try that, go to digitalocean.com

20:25.000 --> 20:26.640
slash features slash storage.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.280
Remember, when you're spinning up a DigitalOcean droplet,

20:28.280 --> 20:29.360
or if you have one spun up already,

20:29.360 --> 20:31.340
you can apply the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

20:31.340 --> 20:32.960
Give yourself credit and support this show.

20:32.960 --> 20:36.280
And then, go check out DOCTL, or TI.

20:36.280 --> 20:37.380
What do you think that is, Wes?

20:37.380 --> 20:38.220
What do you think that is?

20:38.220 --> 20:39.240
Oh, I'll tell you what it is.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.440
DO control.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.200
It's a command line utility

20:42.200 --> 20:44.920
for managing your DigitalOcean droplets.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.100
And it is slick.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.120
It takes advantage of their straightforward API.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.840
Again, another great tool that uses their API.

20:50.840 --> 20:51.680
This.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.200
You should just throw that in the IRC right now.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.040
Oh, I will.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.840
I will drop it in the internet relay chat right now.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.760
Go check them out at digitalocean.com.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.460
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.880
And then, when you need to create something up in the cloud,

21:03.880 --> 21:05.940
or AKA on somebody else's computer

21:05.940 --> 21:07.340
that's way more badass than yours,

21:07.340 --> 21:10.400
go to digitalocean.com and use that promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.880
I'm gonna be talking about track car later today

21:11.880 --> 21:12.840
on the show.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.560
Of course, I have it running on a DigitalOcean droplet.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.520
I just got a Yuba key.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.880
Got my own validation server

21:16.880 --> 21:18.200
on a DigitalOcean droplet.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.040
Boom.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.800
You can do anything with them.

21:20.800 --> 21:21.840
I'll give that a ding, Wes.

21:21.840 --> 21:22.680
I agree.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.480
DigitalOcean.com, please use that promo code DOUNPLUGGED

21:25.480 --> 21:26.880
to support this here show.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.160
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean

21:29.160 --> 21:30.360
for sponsoring Unplugged.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.440
And don't forget,

21:31.440 --> 21:33.720
they do have that block storage early access.

21:33.720 --> 21:34.560
Ooh, I'm excited.

21:34.560 --> 21:35.700
And Naomi, too.

21:35.700 --> 21:36.540
All right, so.

21:36.540 --> 21:37.360
Hey, everybody.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.480
I'm Ryan Sipes,

21:38.480 --> 21:40.740
CTO and community manager at Mycroft AI.

21:40.740 --> 21:44.160
We got ourselves a Mycroft AI update virtual lug.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.800
And I'm sure probably a lot of you

21:45.800 --> 21:47.760
have seen this video already.

21:47.760 --> 21:48.800
Maybe some of you haven't.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.960
And I wanna go through something here.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.360
First of all, I really think it's great

21:52.360 --> 21:53.480
that the Mycroft project

21:53.480 --> 21:55.300
is continuing to do these video updates

21:55.300 --> 21:57.760
because they really are working on something unique here.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.680
Now, Ryan is gonna do a demonstration of the Mycroft.

22:01.680 --> 22:04.980
And Ryan decided not to edit it, I think.

22:04.980 --> 22:06.280
And I wanna continue to play it

22:06.280 --> 22:08.000
because I think he's being very honest

22:08.000 --> 22:09.920
with the performance of the device and how it works.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.000
And so I wanna play a little bit of it.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.600
Today, I have an early developer's kit unit of Mycroft.

22:14.600 --> 22:18.180
And I'm going to be demoing some of the features for you.

22:18.180 --> 22:20.920
Remember that this is an alpha build.

22:20.920 --> 22:23.200
And so you may see some bugs,

22:23.200 --> 22:26.380
but I'm really excited to get to share

22:26.380 --> 22:29.160
what we're working on with you, the internet.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.120
So here we go.

22:35.940 --> 22:37.440
Hey, Mycroft, what time is it?

22:37.440 --> 22:42.440
It is currently 2047, Sunday, April 3rd, 2016.

22:46.000 --> 22:46.880
That is super cool.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.720
And the first thing I noticed

22:48.720 --> 22:49.880
is it didn't sound like Popeye.

22:49.880 --> 22:50.720
What happened there?

22:50.720 --> 22:51.680
I thought it was gonna sound like you, Popeye.

22:51.680 --> 22:56.680
Was that just you showing off the voice emulation stuff?

22:56.680 --> 23:00.160
So the one that it ships with at the moment

23:00.160 --> 23:03.760
is, yeah, whatever their prototype default voice is.

23:03.760 --> 23:08.760
And I finished recording the audio yesterday, day before.

23:09.800 --> 23:10.880
No.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.320
So, yeah.

23:12.320 --> 23:14.240
Yes, that is so cool.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.360
They'll start mushing that.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.480
Somehow, some cloud somewhere

23:18.480 --> 23:20.360
will start turning that into words.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.760
And then I think that'll be an update.

23:22.760 --> 23:23.600
That's a-

23:23.600 --> 23:24.960
You'll be able to read yourself to sleep at night?

23:24.960 --> 23:26.720
That is a fascinating process.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.280
I would like him, you know what?

23:28.280 --> 23:30.440
I would love to somehow be able to document that,

23:30.440 --> 23:32.160
like how they put it all together now.

23:32.160 --> 23:32.980
Boy, isn't that neat?

23:32.980 --> 23:34.560
I can tell you my bit.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.080
Oh yeah, I would, yeah.

23:36.080 --> 23:40.480
Which was, right, so picture the scene,

23:40.480 --> 23:43.760
my son's bedroom with blankets covering all the walls

23:43.760 --> 23:45.400
and all the other hard surfaces.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.880
You mean you don't already have that set up

23:47.880 --> 23:49.800
for recording your podcast, Popeye?

23:49.800 --> 23:52.800
No, not at all, not at all.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.580
But I thought I'd do something half decent for them.

23:55.580 --> 23:59.640
Me sat on the floor with a table with a laptop

23:59.640 --> 24:03.280
and a microphone and me speaking

24:03.280 --> 24:05.880
three and a half thousand sentences into this laptop.

24:05.880 --> 24:06.720
Wow.

24:07.760 --> 24:09.640
So was it tedious or was it fun?

24:09.640 --> 24:10.480
Or it had to be tedious?

24:10.480 --> 24:12.100
Oh my God, it's tedious, yes.

24:12.100 --> 24:12.940
Yes.

24:14.040 --> 24:15.520
Yeah, and the weird thing is,

24:15.520 --> 24:18.600
the phrases, they're snippets from books.

24:18.600 --> 24:21.120
Well, there are bits of The Wizard of Oz,

24:21.120 --> 24:24.160
but in order to not have me linearly,

24:24.160 --> 24:25.540
could you have to read it flat,

24:25.540 --> 24:28.480
like the she-wolf saw the thing?

24:28.480 --> 24:31.200
Like you can't put any intonation in the voice at all.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.460
You have to read it flat.

24:32.460 --> 24:36.200
And every, like you read a line and you think,

24:36.200 --> 24:37.920
oh, he's talking about the scarecrow,

24:37.920 --> 24:38.980
that's from The Wizard of Oz.

24:38.980 --> 24:40.720
And then the very next thing you read

24:40.720 --> 24:41.760
is not from The Wizard of Oz,

24:41.760 --> 24:43.120
it's from a completely different book,

24:43.120 --> 24:46.160
so that you don't start getting into a flow, I think.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.000
Right, you can't tell even any kind of story

24:48.000 --> 24:48.840
with your voice.

24:48.840 --> 24:49.660
Huh.

24:49.660 --> 24:50.500
Right.

24:50.500 --> 24:51.320
Oh, interesting.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.160
And you read all these different phrases

24:52.160 --> 24:53.600
and then once you've read all of the phrases,

24:53.600 --> 24:55.920
they've captured every possible word.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.540
And they don't have you,

24:57.540 --> 24:59.540
they don't have you, like,

25:01.040 --> 25:01.880
so, you know, one of the things.

25:01.880 --> 25:03.920
I don't say, hello, my name is Mycroft,

25:03.920 --> 25:04.840
or anything like that.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.480
I say a whole load of words

25:06.480 --> 25:07.920
that have nothing to do with Mycroft.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.800
At no point did I say the word Mycroft.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.640
But they will be able to generate.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.400
I say a whole bunch of other words.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.240
Yeah, they synthesize.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.200
So I'm interested to find out

25:16.200 --> 25:18.680
when my bank wants to do voice print analysis

25:18.680 --> 25:19.980
for, like, authenticating,

25:19.980 --> 25:21.680
because I'm just gonna say no,

25:21.680 --> 25:23.920
because I know that there are computers out there

25:23.920 --> 25:25.120
that have my voice on them,

25:25.120 --> 25:26.700
so someone could fake my voice.

25:26.700 --> 25:28.920
So I wanna show you, as an example,

25:28.920 --> 25:30.360
I'm gonna do, let's try this.

25:30.360 --> 25:31.200
Hey, Siri.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.560
How many days ago,

25:35.560 --> 25:36.400
or what was the question,

25:36.400 --> 25:37.320
wait, hold on, I should ask Siri.

25:37.320 --> 25:38.600
Well, I can't just remember, okay.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.000
So we tried this on the pre-show.

25:40.000 --> 25:40.840
The reason I wanna bring it up

25:40.840 --> 25:43.480
is because there's, like, a inflection

25:43.480 --> 25:46.960
that the modern voice assistants use

25:48.040 --> 25:48.880
to end a sentence.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.060
So, hey, Siri.

25:51.840 --> 25:52.660
Hey, Siri.

25:52.660 --> 25:57.660
What was the date 106 weeks ago?

25:59.660 --> 26:02.900
It was Tuesday, April 1st, 2014.

26:02.900 --> 26:04.580
April Fools' Day.

26:04.580 --> 26:06.940
You see how she kind of does different, like.

26:06.940 --> 26:07.780
Fools' Day.

26:07.780 --> 26:09.260
Yeah, and then she sort of ends,

26:09.260 --> 26:10.860
there is a way she ends the sentence.

26:10.860 --> 26:14.020
Now, were there, like, did you make clear, like,

26:15.060 --> 26:16.580
punctuations and things like that,

26:16.580 --> 26:17.420
that they would, okay.

26:17.420 --> 26:21.700
Yes, there were bits where I had to ask a question,

26:21.700 --> 26:25.420
and a question mark is one of the sounds

26:25.420 --> 26:26.260
that they capture.

26:26.260 --> 26:28.420
They capture all of them, every sound you make,

26:28.420 --> 26:30.540
and then they synthesize a word out of that.

26:30.540 --> 26:31.380
That is really something.

26:31.380 --> 26:32.900
I have no idea how much it will sound.

26:32.900 --> 26:37.460
It may not ever actually sound like me at all.

26:37.460 --> 26:40.340
Well, the demo they did sounded like you.

26:40.340 --> 26:41.500
Yeah, that was me recorded.

26:41.500 --> 26:42.340
Oh, yeah, that's true.

26:42.340 --> 26:43.180
Yeah, that makes sense.

26:43.180 --> 26:44.020
Right, yeah.

26:45.220 --> 26:47.040
You sounded very robotic, good job.

26:48.980 --> 26:50.060
Wow, so what do you think about

26:50.060 --> 26:51.060
being the voice of Skynet?

26:51.060 --> 26:53.340
Does that weird you out at all?

26:53.340 --> 26:54.180
No, not really.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.580
It's weirded out my coworkers and my friends,

26:57.580 --> 26:58.860
who say it's gonna be really weird

26:58.860 --> 27:01.060
having you talking to me in my house.

27:01.060 --> 27:03.020
I'm like, well, you know.

27:03.020 --> 27:06.300
My thought is, talking to their wife.

27:06.300 --> 27:08.700
As all of the AIs, all of the AIs come online,

27:08.700 --> 27:10.460
because AIs will create more AIs.

27:10.460 --> 27:11.300
Naturally.

27:11.300 --> 27:13.740
Obviously, and they will need to bring

27:13.740 --> 27:15.100
all to their own distinct voices,

27:15.100 --> 27:17.220
and so they will go out into the web,

27:17.220 --> 27:20.680
and they will download all of the podcasts of humanity,

27:20.680 --> 27:23.060
within days, and have listened to all of them.

27:23.060 --> 27:24.900
So all of us that have been in podcasts

27:24.900 --> 27:27.220
will eventually probably be a voice of an AI out there.

27:27.220 --> 27:28.340
Robots are stealing our voices.

27:28.340 --> 27:29.760
Yeah, exactly, in the future.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.260
Future robots are stealing.

27:31.260 --> 27:32.500
Thanks, archive.org.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.920
Anyways, so Ryan continues on,

27:34.920 --> 27:38.580
and I want you to notice how he interacts with it,

27:38.580 --> 27:41.140
and sort of how he chooses not to edit out

27:41.140 --> 27:42.820
some of these things, which I think is great.

27:42.820 --> 27:45.640
Hey, Microp, what's the weather?

27:45.640 --> 27:50.640
Right now, it's clear sky and 73 degrees,

27:53.640 --> 27:58.640
for a high of 75 and a low of 70 in Lawrence, Kansas.

27:59.320 --> 28:02.120
It's going to be a lovely day.

28:02.120 --> 28:02.960
Aw, it smiled after that.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.120
That isn't all that impressive,

28:05.120 --> 28:08.420
but let's see what is going to be the case tomorrow.

28:08.420 --> 28:13.420
Hey, Microp, what's the weather in Kansas City tomorrow?

28:16.420 --> 28:20.060
Tomorrow, Kansas City will have a high of 67

28:20.060 --> 28:23.620
and a low of 49, with clear sky conditions.

28:26.620 --> 28:27.860
A general query.

28:27.860 --> 28:30.740
The unit can also answer various questions

28:30.740 --> 28:33.740
using sources like Wikipedia and Wolfram Alpha.

28:33.740 --> 28:34.980
Let's ask him a question.

28:34.980 --> 28:39.980
Hey, Microp, tell me about Mozilla.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.700
Not as fast as the Echo or Siri or Google, but...

28:43.700 --> 28:45.540
I am looking for Mozilla.

28:45.540 --> 28:46.380
Still looking.

28:47.340 --> 28:48.180
And those eyes are so cute.

28:48.180 --> 28:50.420
Mozilla is a free software community

28:50.420 --> 28:53.940
created in 1998 by members of Netscape.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.620
The Mozilla community uses, develops,

28:56.620 --> 28:59.060
spreads, and supports Mozilla products,

28:59.060 --> 29:01.900
thereby promoting exclusively free software

29:01.900 --> 29:06.100
and opens standards with only minor exceptions.

29:06.100 --> 29:08.420
Uh-oh, future podcaster right there.

29:08.420 --> 29:10.020
So kind of, and I like that Ryan left in

29:10.020 --> 29:11.100
how long it takes to do the things.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.420
If you guys want to watch the whole video,

29:12.420 --> 29:14.140
you can in the show notes.

29:14.140 --> 29:15.380
And obviously that's going to improve

29:15.380 --> 29:16.920
as the hardware gets more powerful

29:16.920 --> 29:18.660
and as the backend services grow.

29:18.660 --> 29:20.020
Right. That'll get faster and faster.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.700
I've been hearing a lot of people talk about their Echo.

29:21.700 --> 29:22.540
Have you tried one?

29:22.540 --> 29:23.360
I haven't, no.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.780
Anybody in the Mumber Room have that Amazon Echo?

29:25.780 --> 29:26.780
Or something like it?

29:28.100 --> 29:30.140
I've been hearing a lot of people talk about it,

29:30.140 --> 29:32.060
but, or reading a lot of people talk about it

29:32.060 --> 29:33.580
and watching on YouTube, but.

29:33.580 --> 29:36.180
I guess I would consider trying the Pi one.

29:36.180 --> 29:38.160
Yeah, where you can load the Alexia service

29:38.160 --> 29:39.500
or whatever on a Pi.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.780
Yeah, that is pretty neat, actually.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.200
Then you can at least kind of sandbox it

29:42.200 --> 29:43.500
or have some control.

29:43.500 --> 29:46.100
Yeah. All right, well I know,

29:46.100 --> 29:47.820
okay, I know we're going to have

29:49.020 --> 29:51.900
at least somebody that is interested in XFCE.

29:51.900 --> 29:56.140
We got an update on XFCE 4.14 is going to go,

29:56.140 --> 29:58.260
are you ready for this, Wes?

29:58.260 --> 29:59.100
GTK 3.

29:59.100 --> 29:59.940
What?

29:59.940 --> 30:02.740
They're going to replace their D-Bus implementation

30:02.740 --> 30:03.660
with GD-Bus.

30:03.660 --> 30:06.140
They're going to go new icon names across the boards.

30:06.140 --> 30:07.700
They're going to replace old widgets.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.300
They're going to replace core components

30:09.300 --> 30:10.280
like their compositor.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.420
They're going to update their compositor

30:11.420 --> 30:15.140
to actually use OpenGL and GLX for compositing

30:15.140 --> 30:15.960
instead of XRender.

30:15.960 --> 30:16.800
Sweet.

30:18.020 --> 30:19.000
They're going to redo their panel

30:19.000 --> 30:23.140
to support GTK 3 across the board.

30:23.140 --> 30:25.580
Now they've already shown an example of their,

30:25.580 --> 30:26.500
some of their work.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.340
One of those is a GTK 3 app

30:28.340 --> 30:31.220
and one of them is their old GTK 2 app.

30:31.220 --> 30:33.500
And you really can't tell the difference.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.320
The one on the left is GTK 3.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.260
They're probably going to try to keep it

30:39.260 --> 30:40.860
as close as possible, I would guess.

30:40.860 --> 30:41.760
Hey.

30:41.760 --> 30:42.600
Yeah.

30:42.600 --> 30:43.420
Yeah.

30:43.420 --> 30:44.260
That'll keep people happy anyway.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.380
I'm kind of actually,

30:45.380 --> 30:48.100
I'm kind of curious about Wimpy's thoughts on this,

30:48.100 --> 30:51.260
just having spent a lot of effort and energy

30:51.260 --> 30:56.260
having people working on Mate getting GTK 3 support going.

30:56.260 --> 30:58.100
Is this, what do you think, Wimpy?

30:58.100 --> 31:00.500
Is this an obvious step for them

31:00.500 --> 31:01.820
and will it actually happen?

31:03.500 --> 31:05.500
I think it'll happen.

31:05.500 --> 31:08.980
The X, well, the lines are blurred a bit for me

31:08.980 --> 31:11.620
between Xfce and Xubuntu.

31:11.620 --> 31:12.460
Okay.

31:12.460 --> 31:15.780
It seems to me that the lead developer for Xubuntu

31:15.780 --> 31:19.020
is doing most of the Xfce development now.

31:19.020 --> 31:24.020
So if his advancements are anything to be taken as well,

31:24.020 --> 31:26.740
anything to be taken as reference,

31:26.740 --> 31:28.780
then yes, it's likely to happen.

31:28.780 --> 31:31.660
And it's a big job.

31:31.660 --> 31:34.100
So again, I don't know Xfce very well.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.880
I know it sort of pulls in other components,

31:36.880 --> 31:39.500
you know, like open box and stuff like that.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.720
And some of the underlying bits are different,

31:41.720 --> 31:45.920
although it uses its own window energy now, doesn't it, Xfwm.

31:45.920 --> 31:50.580
So it's taken us ages and we've only got a small team.

31:50.580 --> 31:52.860
I don't know how big the Xfce team

31:52.860 --> 31:54.500
and how far along they are,

31:54.500 --> 31:58.300
but like what the Marte team have done,

31:58.300 --> 32:00.820
I think Xfce really have to do this,

32:00.820 --> 32:03.100
need to do it to stay relevant

32:03.100 --> 32:05.740
with the rest of the desktop components.

32:05.740 --> 32:07.020
Well, even just to support Wayland,

32:07.020 --> 32:08.820
don't you have to eventually get here?

32:08.820 --> 32:13.260
Well, Wayland and Mir, because both of those have got-

32:13.260 --> 32:14.860
Right, Mir's a thing too, yeah.

32:14.860 --> 32:16.600
Yeah, Mir's totally a thing.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.860
And from my point of view,

32:18.860 --> 32:22.100
the most important thing that GTK brings to the table

32:22.100 --> 32:23.420
is high DPI.

32:23.420 --> 32:25.320
Yes, absolutely.

32:25.320 --> 32:28.940
More than Wayland, more than Mir,

32:28.940 --> 32:31.140
more than, you know, composited desktops,

32:31.140 --> 32:33.900
the most important thing is high DPI.

32:33.900 --> 32:35.420
I think we're just,

32:35.420 --> 32:37.980
we're not quite at the tipping point yet,

32:37.980 --> 32:40.780
but I think in a year from now,

32:40.780 --> 32:43.020
high DPI is going to be,

32:43.020 --> 32:44.340
if you're not doing high DPI,

32:44.340 --> 32:46.820
if you can't support it, that's gonna be an issue.

32:47.980 --> 32:49.580
Well said.

32:49.580 --> 32:51.460
Richard, if you wanted to jump in on this,

32:51.460 --> 32:54.180
I'd be curious to know your thoughts on,

32:54.180 --> 32:56.540
what do you think, just your personal opinion,

32:56.540 --> 32:59.660
XFCE could do to make itself more attractive to distros?

32:59.660 --> 33:01.060
We kind of talked about this last week

33:01.060 --> 33:02.960
in regards to the Plasma desktop.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.160
Using that same kind of lens,

33:04.160 --> 33:05.860
what are your thoughts about XFCE?

33:07.020 --> 33:10.100
I don't think it needs to make itself more attractive.

33:10.100 --> 33:11.580
I mean, it is, on openSUSE,

33:11.580 --> 33:14.180
the most popular lightweight desktop we've got.

33:15.220 --> 33:19.100
So, I mean, I'm really interested to see them jump to GTK 3,

33:19.100 --> 33:21.060
because like for us, the pain point has often been

33:21.060 --> 33:23.620
like keeping all this GTK 2.2 stuff about.

33:25.300 --> 33:27.760
As long as it's relatively easy for us to package

33:27.760 --> 33:28.600
and live with.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.420
Right, that could make it a lot.

33:29.420 --> 33:30.260
Bring it on.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.180
Yeah, because now you only have to worry about GTK 3

33:32.180 --> 33:34.120
for a majority of your install base.

33:35.900 --> 33:36.740
I didn't think about that.

33:36.740 --> 33:37.560
Yeah.

33:37.560 --> 33:38.400
That's a great point.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.520
Yeah, this reduces the GTK 2 dependency

33:41.520 --> 33:43.780
for a ton of people once they get there.

33:43.780 --> 33:44.700
I mean, it's probably gonna take a while

33:44.700 --> 33:46.380
to get to that point, to be honest with you.

33:46.380 --> 33:47.220
Yes.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.040
But that-

33:48.040 --> 33:48.880
But it's on the roadmap.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.700
Yeah.

33:49.700 --> 33:53.060
There's an awful lot of GTK 2 desktop applications

33:53.060 --> 33:53.880
out there that-

33:53.880 --> 33:54.720
Right.

33:54.720 --> 33:56.860
What are you using, Wimpy, that's still GTK 2?

33:56.860 --> 33:57.700
GIMP?

33:57.700 --> 33:58.700
Firefox.

33:58.700 --> 33:59.700
Oh yeah, Firefox.

33:59.700 --> 34:00.540
I don't use Firefox.

34:00.540 --> 34:01.360
Firefox.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.200
Yeah, yeah.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.040
Firefox has GTK 3, though.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.180
It's pretty good at this point.

34:04.180 --> 34:05.060
I do use GIMP.

34:05.060 --> 34:06.160
I forgot about GIMP.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.000
I do use GIMP.

34:07.000 --> 34:07.840
There's so many.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.660
Yeah.

34:08.660 --> 34:09.500
There's so many.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.340
How can GIMP still be on?

34:10.340 --> 34:13.740
How can GIMP not be on the new GIMP toolkit?

34:13.740 --> 34:14.760
I told you.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.760
How can GIMP not be on GTK 3 at this point?

34:16.760 --> 34:19.220
I mean, obviously it's huge, but that's-

34:19.220 --> 34:21.460
It's to stop being the GIMP toolkit long ago.

34:21.460 --> 34:22.300
Yeah, I know.

34:22.300 --> 34:23.120
I know.

34:23.120 --> 34:23.960
I'm just making-

34:23.960 --> 34:24.800
Toolkit.

34:24.800 --> 34:25.620
Just taking a shot,

34:25.620 --> 34:27.460
because it does seem a little crazy that GIMP isn't-

34:27.460 --> 34:28.660
Are they working on this now?

34:28.660 --> 34:30.380
There's a port in progress.

34:30.380 --> 34:31.220
Yeah.

34:31.220 --> 34:34.020
You're saying GIMP is taking a long time to do things?

34:34.020 --> 34:34.860
No.

34:34.860 --> 34:35.700
No way.

34:35.700 --> 34:36.520
No way.

34:36.520 --> 34:39.340
Rodden, did you have any thoughts on the XFCE roadmap

34:39.340 --> 34:41.340
before we move on from the topic?

34:41.340 --> 34:42.940
Well, I think it's funny that it's on there,

34:42.940 --> 34:44.300
because it's like, yeah, okay,

34:44.300 --> 34:46.940
it was on there like three years ago as well.

34:46.940 --> 34:49.340
So, we'll see.

34:49.340 --> 34:50.460
Yeah.

34:50.460 --> 34:52.220
Yeah, I mean, it takes a while, especially for them.

34:52.220 --> 34:53.060
It does take a while.

34:53.060 --> 34:54.500
Derek Delvin, you want to jump in about GIMP.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.380
Go ahead.

34:55.380 --> 34:57.540
I just wanted to say that it's a good opportunity

34:57.540 --> 34:59.660
for GIMP to revamp their UI again

34:59.660 --> 35:01.660
and actually make something decent.

35:01.660 --> 35:02.500
Hmm.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.060
Just a hint to say,

35:04.060 --> 35:06.020
take the chance you're putting into GTK 3,

35:06.020 --> 35:08.940
the part of building UI components is there,

35:08.940 --> 35:11.180
not take the chance to make better UI.

35:11.180 --> 35:12.680
I'll make a proposal for you.

35:12.680 --> 35:17.240
Maybe they should go the route of starting

35:17.240 --> 35:20.060
with Google Photos, or Google, I mean, GNOME Photos.

35:20.060 --> 35:23.160
Start with GNOME Photos and go from there.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.100
Sort of recently, this affected Ange.

35:27.100 --> 35:29.280
Apple just totally dropped the ball

35:29.280 --> 35:31.160
on their iPhoto program, which was like,

35:31.160 --> 35:33.560
a key part of the switch to Mac iLife suite

35:33.560 --> 35:35.880
is this iPhoto, and so she puts, you know,

35:35.880 --> 35:37.680
I like, you know, terabyte or something,

35:37.680 --> 35:40.000
I don't know, just a crap ton of pictures in there.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.280
And then they come along and say,

35:41.280 --> 35:43.200
oh yeah, we're no longer gonna make iPhoto,

35:43.200 --> 35:45.600
but we're gonna take our iOS app

35:45.600 --> 35:48.120
and we're going to scale it up for the desktop.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.520
And I thought this was gonna be a horrible train wreck

35:50.520 --> 35:52.160
for her, but so far, it's gone fine.

35:52.160 --> 35:54.320
And the idea might be sort of the same for GIMP,

35:54.320 --> 35:57.600
maybe you, because GNOME Photos is in way better shape

35:57.600 --> 36:00.580
and it's already a desktop application with great features.

36:00.580 --> 36:04.040
And so, why not just start with that?

36:04.040 --> 36:05.280
Well, I don't know.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.480
I guess there is somebody, RealAzure out there,

36:07.480 --> 36:09.720
RealAzure out there says he likes the GIMP UI.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.680
Kitson, you wanted to jump in about GTK apps

36:11.680 --> 36:12.960
being unmaintainable in the long run.

36:12.960 --> 36:13.800
Go ahead.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.320
Yeah, it just may be that they are unmaintainable

36:16.320 --> 36:18.420
in the long run when you are talking about

36:18.420 --> 36:21.760
going from version two to three, et cetera.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.520
And I wonder if somebody could maybe do a comparison

36:24.520 --> 36:28.280
between QT and KDE apps and how they fared

36:28.280 --> 36:32.360
from version to version and see if there's similar issues.

36:32.360 --> 36:35.160
Because this is something that I have noticed

36:35.160 --> 36:37.880
between major desktop shifts.

36:37.880 --> 36:40.680
There's differences, but there's never been

36:40.680 --> 36:43.160
a catastrophic, like, massive bug

36:43.160 --> 36:45.520
that's between QT4 and QT5.

36:45.520 --> 36:49.600
There were a few things that were harder to port,

36:49.600 --> 36:52.400
like Dolphin took longer than expected.

36:52.400 --> 36:55.200
But the majority of the stuff moved over very quickly.

36:57.400 --> 37:00.800
Yeah, I know, it's because every tool change stack

37:00.800 --> 37:03.720
is gonna have some kind of pain at some point.

37:03.720 --> 37:08.200
Like, we've got QT5.6 in Tumbleweed staging right now,

37:08.200 --> 37:11.200
and it just seems to be randomly breaking keyboard shortcuts.

37:11.200 --> 37:14.520
But that's true of, like, every major upgrade.

37:14.520 --> 37:18.280
Apart from 320 for GTK, it was pretty smooth.

37:18.280 --> 37:22.760
Really, yeah, I mean, I feel like that's a valid concern

37:22.760 --> 37:26.480
when GTK3 first came out, and maybe until,

37:26.480 --> 37:29.480
maybe even till 3.10, 3.12.

37:29.480 --> 37:30.400
Yeah, 3.12, maybe.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.560
Yeah, I mean, maybe, but I mean,

37:32.560 --> 37:34.640
if that's, even 3.12 was really pushing it,

37:34.640 --> 37:36.960
and that's years into it at that point.

37:36.960 --> 37:37.800
Right.

37:37.800 --> 37:40.760
Keeping pace with the development

37:44.400 --> 37:47.760
momentum that's going on in GTK3

37:47.760 --> 37:52.760
when you're not part of that core team is really hard.

37:53.080 --> 37:58.080
We've tried really hard to align the Marte release

37:58.080 --> 38:03.080
with the GTK3 releases, and we managed it to.

38:03.520 --> 38:08.120
The releases, Marte 1.12 and Marte 1.14,

38:08.120 --> 38:11.760
they've been released alongside GTK 3.2,

38:11.760 --> 38:16.760
but almost the whole five-month cycle for Marte 1.14

38:17.600 --> 38:21.680
was accommodating the changes in GTK3.20,

38:21.680 --> 38:26.080
which is significantly different from 3.18 under the hood.

38:26.080 --> 38:28.760
Is it wimpy, in your opinion, that GTK3

38:28.760 --> 38:31.220
is still just so busy catching up

38:31.220 --> 38:32.880
that they have to be this aggressive,

38:32.880 --> 38:36.480
or is it perhaps legitimately time to reconsider

38:36.480 --> 38:38.280
either A, the six-month cycle,

38:38.280 --> 38:41.020
or B, switching to a different release style?

38:41.880 --> 38:43.040
And there could be release styles

38:43.040 --> 38:44.780
that accommodate a six-month cycle,

38:44.780 --> 38:47.480
but yet, if you use something like a feature flag set,

38:47.480 --> 38:50.320
just like Open ZFS does, where you have feature flags,

38:50.320 --> 38:52.580
and you just don't, if you don't support those flags,

38:52.580 --> 38:53.600
then you're not incompatible,

38:53.600 --> 38:55.880
you just can't use those features.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.440
I think the actual solution to this problem

38:59.440 --> 39:04.440
are things like XDG app, and Snappy, and AppImage,

39:06.360 --> 39:10.880
and that we can start to focus on building a runtime

39:10.880 --> 39:15.120
for a desktop environment, and we can just say,

39:15.120 --> 39:18.620
we are going to target this and the next two versions

39:18.620 --> 39:22.860
of Marte against these libraries,

39:22.860 --> 39:26.720
and it doesn't matter what the development momentum is.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.560
That really does make the most sense.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.480
We've got a platform that we can build against,

39:31.480 --> 39:35.280
and I'm not sure when that's going to be a reality for us,

39:35.280 --> 39:40.000
but when I see, I mean, the GNOME team are innovating,

39:40.000 --> 39:41.260
they're taking things forward,

39:41.260 --> 39:43.040
they're developing very quickly,

39:43.040 --> 39:45.440
but it's very, very difficult for other projects

39:45.440 --> 39:48.720
to keep pace with that, because they've got

39:48.720 --> 39:51.600
a lot of full-time developers, and we simply don't.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.520
So I think the solution to this problem

39:54.520 --> 39:57.000
for smaller projects like ours

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
is to start to exploit these container-based,

40:02.080 --> 40:07.080
these isolated runtimes and application environments,

40:07.120 --> 40:09.800
and start to leverage those, so we can say,

40:09.800 --> 40:12.060
we're going to put a flag in the ground here.

40:12.060 --> 40:14.720
This is our tool set version we're going to target,

40:14.720 --> 40:19.440
and we can just build against that for whatever period.

40:19.440 --> 40:22.400
Interesting, that really seems like what that would do

40:22.400 --> 40:27.000
is it relieves the pressure off of the downstream projects

40:27.000 --> 40:28.640
to sort of, like you said, exactly say,

40:28.640 --> 40:30.300
we're going to stabilize around this for a while,

40:30.300 --> 40:32.320
and then because the end users remain unaffected

40:32.320 --> 40:35.720
with XGG app, and although I would imagine XGG app

40:35.720 --> 40:37.520
is going to be the most tied to GTK features

40:37.520 --> 40:42.000
as of all of them, but that would probably solve

40:42.000 --> 40:43.320
the problem and allow each project

40:43.320 --> 40:45.600
to work at their own rational pace.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.120
Odyssey, you have some experience

40:47.120 --> 40:51.320
with a drawing application that's making the transition.

40:51.320 --> 40:52.160
How did that go?

40:53.960 --> 40:57.040
So far, when we first ported MyPay over to GK,

40:57.040 --> 40:58.920
when MyPay was ported to GTK 3,

40:58.920 --> 41:02.040
it actually broke a lot of our cross-platform builds

41:02.040 --> 41:03.240
for Mac and Windows.

41:05.440 --> 41:08.120
And even with the update to GLib,

41:08.120 --> 41:10.000
they may have changed the way it handles GLib,

41:10.000 --> 41:14.120
it ended up breaking builds for Integra or Arch builds.

41:14.120 --> 41:14.960
No!

41:14.960 --> 41:16.080
No!

41:16.080 --> 41:18.880
So are you saying software development breaks things?

41:18.880 --> 41:21.720
Now, is this a matter of hours to resolve,

41:21.720 --> 41:23.600
days, months, unresolved?

41:23.600 --> 41:26.240
What is the process when something like this happens?

41:28.040 --> 41:30.320
Usually, it comes down to just trying to get the person

41:30.320 --> 41:32.740
who first reported the issue on their GitHub page

41:32.740 --> 41:37.740
to just kind of submit the debug reports on Python stuff.

41:39.360 --> 41:44.360
And then our only developer actually opens up the ticket

41:44.360 --> 41:46.120
on the actual GTK to get it fixed.

41:46.120 --> 41:48.600
See, I haven't asked the obvious question.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.480
What was the catalyst to go to GTK 3?

41:54.440 --> 41:55.640
I don't exactly remember,

41:55.640 --> 41:58.720
it's why we've been using it since it came out.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.960
Because it's awesome!

42:00.960 --> 42:01.800
All right.

42:01.800 --> 42:02.640
Embracing the future.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.160
I think it was just trying to keep up with GNOME.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.000
Yeah.

42:06.180 --> 42:09.880
The problem with GTK 3 on Windows and Mac

42:09.880 --> 42:14.460
is because the pace for GTK is still being,

42:14.460 --> 42:18.200
it's still being the GNOME pace of six months,

42:18.200 --> 42:20.400
but the pace for the Windows and Mac builds

42:20.400 --> 42:23.480
are actually like two versions behind.

42:23.480 --> 42:25.000
Right, yeah.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.800
Yeah, and the major problems with us,

42:26.800 --> 42:29.460
with the GTK part, is the fact that the tablet support,

42:29.460 --> 42:31.360
even though our Wacom tablets worked okay,

42:31.360 --> 42:33.080
a lot of the Opera ads will not.

42:35.840 --> 42:38.960
Well, I guess I appreciate the insights there, honestly,

42:38.960 --> 42:40.500
because I hadn't really, I hadn't heard about it

42:40.500 --> 42:43.760
from that kind of breakage standpoint.

42:43.760 --> 42:44.800
The other kind of things I've usually heard

42:44.800 --> 42:47.000
are more on the desktop level.

42:47.000 --> 42:47.840
So.

42:47.840 --> 42:48.660
Just to point out one thing, though,

42:48.660 --> 42:52.960
is that the speed of a toolkit does not necessarily

42:52.960 --> 42:54.720
mean there's going to be a lot of breakage.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.820
Because if you pay attention to the release dates

42:56.820 --> 43:00.400
of KDE and QT, it's actually like every four months,

43:00.400 --> 43:01.560
three to four months.

43:01.560 --> 43:03.340
So they're doing double pace,

43:03.340 --> 43:05.600
and they're not breaking stuff.

43:05.600 --> 43:06.660
Okay.

43:06.660 --> 43:07.680
All right, so there you go.

43:07.680 --> 43:12.080
There's Rotten's obligatory plug of the week.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.720
I'll make my obligatory plug of the week.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.040
Now, that's Ting, everybody.

43:15.040 --> 43:16.960
Go to last, no, linux.ting.com.

43:16.960 --> 43:17.800
I'm gonna go to linux.ting.com.

43:17.800 --> 43:18.640
Those guys are jerks.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.480
Go to linux.

43:19.480 --> 43:20.300
Careful now, Chris.

43:20.300 --> 43:21.140
Linux.com.

43:21.140 --> 43:21.980
I'm at war with the Linux action show.

43:21.980 --> 43:22.820
Me too.

43:22.820 --> 43:24.280
Yeah, that one guy that's on the show all the time,

43:24.280 --> 43:25.280
he's always wearing red.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.280
It's obnoxious.

43:26.280 --> 43:27.420
I don't like it.

43:27.420 --> 43:30.280
So if you would like to save a little cash

43:30.280 --> 43:31.600
on your next mobile service provider,

43:31.600 --> 43:33.680
and you want to put the power back in your pocket

43:33.680 --> 43:35.280
in your relationship with your service provider,

43:35.280 --> 43:37.880
and you would like to disrupt the duopoly a bit

43:37.880 --> 43:38.720
and vote with your wallet,

43:38.720 --> 43:39.920
go to linux.ting.com.

43:39.920 --> 43:41.600
You get yourself a discount off your first Ting device,

43:41.600 --> 43:44.320
or if you bring a Ting compatible device,

43:44.320 --> 43:46.520
and you likely will because they got two networks.

43:46.520 --> 43:47.440
You're kidding.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.540
Well, then you're gonna get $25 in service credit.

43:49.540 --> 43:51.640
Your first month, probably gonna be about 23 bucks

43:51.640 --> 43:52.820
if you're an average user.

43:52.820 --> 43:54.360
They got great customer service.

43:54.360 --> 43:56.200
You get to speak to a real human being.

43:56.200 --> 43:58.200
GSM and CDMA services,

43:58.200 --> 44:00.480
you get to pick whichever is better in your area.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.240
And I found this to be extremely useful

44:02.240 --> 44:03.400
when I go on the road trip.

44:03.400 --> 44:04.740
They have enough, I mean,

44:04.740 --> 44:07.920
I was gonna say an ANFAD metanisable or something.

44:07.920 --> 44:09.100
I was trying to come up with a new word,

44:09.100 --> 44:10.400
something like my kids would think of

44:10.400 --> 44:13.400
for something that's so mind-bendingly awesome.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.700
One of the first things that really,

44:14.700 --> 44:16.020
I mean, there's a ton of things.

44:16.020 --> 44:17.560
You can set up thresholds and alerts

44:17.560 --> 44:19.100
and all these kinds of things,

44:19.100 --> 44:20.820
but when I realized,

44:20.820 --> 44:23.200
geez, it's only $6 a month for a Ting line,

44:23.200 --> 44:26.840
I was like, I'm gonna give our nanny a line.

44:27.780 --> 44:29.920
We had a nanny, and I wanted her to have a phone

44:29.920 --> 44:31.080
so she could always contact us,

44:31.080 --> 44:32.480
and I want it to be a smartphone

44:32.480 --> 44:34.280
so that way she could send us pictures of the kids

44:34.280 --> 44:35.120
and we could, you know,

44:35.120 --> 44:37.160
because she had just this,

44:37.160 --> 44:39.880
I won't even, it was just a garbage feature phone.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.320
Six bucks a month, right?

44:41.320 --> 44:42.280
So then I go into Ting,

44:42.280 --> 44:44.760
and I label this as the nanny's line.

44:44.760 --> 44:47.440
And so I can see how much data she's using specifically,

44:47.440 --> 44:48.600
and I can set thresholds,

44:48.600 --> 44:51.360
and I can be like, really?

44:51.360 --> 44:52.200
Really?

44:52.200 --> 44:53.640
Don't need 10 gigs of data this time.

44:53.640 --> 44:56.740
Right, or I can just turn it off or anything like that.

44:56.740 --> 44:58.560
So when we no longer have a nanny,

44:58.560 --> 44:59.860
just turn that line off and no longer,

44:59.860 --> 45:01.000
I'm just not paying for it.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.800
It's really, it's a super nice control panel.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.040
And that's just, I'm just scratching the surface.

45:04.040 --> 45:06.480
They have companion apps and all kinds of stuff.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.720
It's a really, really great service.

45:07.720 --> 45:09.000
They have everything from feature phones,

45:09.000 --> 45:09.960
just the bare SIM cards,

45:09.960 --> 45:11.600
all the way up to the best smart devices.

45:11.600 --> 45:14.120
You can bring them yourself or grab one from Ting.

45:14.120 --> 45:16.200
And they're doing the great Ting mobile data experiment.

45:16.200 --> 45:17.560
They have information over at their blog.

45:17.560 --> 45:18.600
If you'd like to get involved,

45:18.600 --> 45:20.040
they have a great blog with tons of good info,

45:20.040 --> 45:22.760
including a recent review of the Roku 3

45:22.760 --> 45:23.980
and the Roku streaming stick.

45:23.980 --> 45:24.980
Check them out.

45:24.980 --> 45:27.160
You start by going to linux.ting.com.

45:27.160 --> 45:28.280
That supports this show.

45:28.280 --> 45:30.160
You can try out their savings calculator.

45:30.160 --> 45:31.400
This is kind of cool too.

45:31.400 --> 45:34.480
Because you know, I'd say if you're a listener

45:34.480 --> 45:36.840
to our audience, you're already kind of by default

45:36.840 --> 45:40.360
a pretty good target for the Ting service.

45:40.360 --> 45:41.480
But you can just sort of verify

45:41.480 --> 45:42.600
where things would line up for you

45:42.600 --> 45:44.320
by seeing how your rates and plan

45:44.320 --> 45:45.400
would stack up to what Ting would do.

45:45.400 --> 45:46.240
You go over to.

45:46.240 --> 45:47.380
And they're so transparent about it.

45:47.380 --> 45:48.400
Yeah, it is nice.

45:48.400 --> 45:49.960
Because you know, if you're not gonna save money,

45:49.960 --> 45:51.400
then just don't switch.

45:51.400 --> 45:52.600
But you likely are gonna save money,

45:52.600 --> 45:54.200
especially if you're Wi-Fi savvy.

45:54.200 --> 45:55.720
Just start by going to linux.ting.com

45:55.720 --> 45:57.240
and use the savings calculator.

45:57.240 --> 46:00.300
Plug in your current usage and just get an idea.

46:00.300 --> 46:04.440
And like for me, because I got Wi-Fi everywhere I'm at.

46:04.440 --> 46:06.560
I used, I actually, even when I don't have Wi-Fi,

46:06.560 --> 46:09.040
I still, you know, I don't really worry about it that much.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.860
And it's still, everything works out just fine.

46:10.860 --> 46:13.700
Plus, I don't, this is the one thing where I do save.

46:13.700 --> 46:16.960
I almost, I probably haven't received a text message

46:16.960 --> 46:18.640
since New Year's.

46:18.640 --> 46:19.840
Wow.

46:19.840 --> 46:21.240
Everything else is Telegram.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.320
Right. Yeah.

46:22.320 --> 46:24.300
Or Hangouts.

46:24.300 --> 46:25.140
Speak of the devil.

46:25.140 --> 46:26.960
Wow, that is some crazy timing right there.

46:26.960 --> 46:28.000
There's Telegram.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.160
I love it.

46:31.160 --> 46:35.960
Yeah, and it's, that right there has been like,

46:35.960 --> 46:37.840
because I don't use the phone much,

46:37.840 --> 46:40.420
because I use Telegram or Hangouts for everything,

46:40.420 --> 46:43.380
and because I've got pretty much Wi-Fi everywhere,

46:43.380 --> 46:45.240
except for when I'm on the road,

46:45.240 --> 46:47.080
my Ting bill, even with three lines,

46:47.080 --> 46:48.440
is usually under 40 bucks.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.360
Nice. Yeah.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.400
I've saved a ton of money by switching to Ting.

46:51.400 --> 46:55.040
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting

46:55.040 --> 46:58.640
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.020
Okay, so I've been teasing it,

47:00.020 --> 47:05.020
but 106 weeks ago on April 1st, 2014,

47:05.040 --> 47:07.480
we talked about nationally syndicated

47:07.480 --> 47:09.320
Premier Radio Network's host,

47:09.320 --> 47:10.860
Leo Laporte. My good friend.

47:10.860 --> 47:13.080
The tech guy who we, from time to time, play.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.360
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

47:15.360 --> 47:16.900
If you're, and you know who you are.

47:16.900 --> 47:18.120
If you're somebody who doesn't wanna mess with,

47:18.120 --> 47:19.240
I just wanna surf the,

47:19.240 --> 47:21.000
just wanna buy something on Amazon,

47:21.000 --> 47:22.680
send an email to my kids,

47:22.680 --> 47:24.120
look at some websites.

47:24.120 --> 47:26.960
If that's you, you don't wanna mess with it,

47:26.960 --> 47:29.160
probably not a good choice.

47:29.160 --> 47:30.740
I think Chromebooks are a good choice.

47:30.740 --> 47:32.780
I think a new version of Windows would be fine.

47:32.780 --> 47:34.560
Windows 8, if you can afford it.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.800
A Macintosh, if you've got even more money,

47:36.800 --> 47:37.880
that's a good choice.

47:38.840 --> 47:42.120
It's only for the enthusiasts that I'd recommend Ubuntu.

47:42.120 --> 47:44.440
So that was on his radio show,

47:44.440 --> 47:47.760
and we were just very displeased.

47:47.760 --> 47:50.540
And the reason why Leo had made that recommendation was

47:50.540 --> 47:53.600
is he'd gotten some bad advice from his chat room.

47:53.600 --> 47:54.880
I don't know, did you ever hear this episode?

47:54.880 --> 47:55.700
Do you remember this?

47:55.700 --> 47:56.540
Do you recall this?

47:56.540 --> 47:57.360
You know, I think I did listen to it,

47:57.360 --> 47:58.200
but it's been a while.

47:58.200 --> 47:59.160
Yeah, yeah.

47:59.160 --> 48:00.640
And we were like, oh man.

48:00.640 --> 48:04.600
And it was also, it was at the peak of some other bad press

48:04.600 --> 48:05.800
that Linux had recently gotten.

48:05.800 --> 48:06.960
And it was sort of all, it was like,

48:06.960 --> 48:08.800
oh, this is just another blow.

48:08.800 --> 48:13.200
Well, I felt after 106 weeks, it took a little while.

48:13.200 --> 48:16.760
But I felt recently, Leo really got it right.

48:16.760 --> 48:19.220
And props to the subreddit for pointing this out.

48:19.220 --> 48:22.080
But Leo stopped, he did his homework,

48:22.080 --> 48:27.080
and at the end of this week in Google episode 347,

48:27.240 --> 48:29.760
he talked about his experiences studying Linux.

48:29.760 --> 48:32.480
And I thought as, I thought for us,

48:32.480 --> 48:35.040
because a lot of us are always thinking about

48:35.040 --> 48:37.040
the new users that are coming to Linux,

48:37.040 --> 48:38.000
which just drives me crazy.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.640
It's like, let's focus on the geeks for a while

48:39.640 --> 48:40.600
and get that right.

48:40.600 --> 48:42.200
But all of us here.

48:42.200 --> 48:43.960
Anyways, we're always talking about, you know,

48:43.960 --> 48:46.360
the new user, the defaults, all that kind of stuff.

48:46.360 --> 48:50.040
And so it's really interesting to listen to Leo's

48:50.040 --> 48:53.040
journey into Linux, because it reminds me very much

48:53.040 --> 48:56.360
in some ways of Chase's journey into Linux a little bit.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.680
And he actually did his homework here.

48:57.680 --> 49:01.040
And so it's sort of, it's kind of educational

49:01.040 --> 49:01.880
to listen to this.

49:01.880 --> 49:04.400
So I'm gonna play a bit of this, just a little bit of it,

49:04.400 --> 49:07.520
as sort of a follow up from our coverage

49:08.440 --> 49:10.160
on April 1st, 2014.

49:10.160 --> 49:12.040
Has kind of made me think, I really probably

49:12.040 --> 49:14.720
should start looking at another operating system.

49:14.720 --> 49:18.920
You know, the best desktop, without anybody knowing it,

49:18.920 --> 49:22.680
the year of desktop Linux happened with Chrome OS.

49:22.680 --> 49:23.840
That is Linux.

49:24.720 --> 49:26.320
And it's a-

49:26.320 --> 49:28.040
You can't really install anything on it.

49:28.040 --> 49:30.440
No, but it's really gets you most of the way there.

49:30.440 --> 49:32.760
It is Linux, and a lot of the merits of it

49:32.760 --> 49:36.040
are based on the fact that it's based on Linux.

49:36.040 --> 49:38.640
So people, and Android is Linux as well.

49:38.640 --> 49:40.680
So Google's done a lot to put Linux in the mainstream,

49:40.680 --> 49:45.160
but I thought, I wouldn't mind finding a desktop Linux

49:45.160 --> 49:49.160
that would give me all of the stuff I get

49:49.160 --> 49:50.960
from OS X or Windows.

49:50.960 --> 49:55.400
Now actually, just as I start engaged in this process,

49:55.400 --> 49:58.200
Microsoft announced that they're gonna put

49:58.200 --> 50:01.200
the Bash shell in Windows.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.800
God damn it.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.800
Which is really good news for web developers,

50:04.800 --> 50:08.200
anybody who's used to the Unix tool chain,

50:08.200 --> 50:11.400
and most developers want some sort of Unix tool chain.

50:11.400 --> 50:15.840
That means Windows is no longer out of the question.

50:15.840 --> 50:17.560
I was pretty impressed so far, what I was hearing.

50:17.560 --> 50:18.560
Are you impressed so far?

50:18.560 --> 50:19.400
Yeah.

50:19.400 --> 50:20.240
I also want that chair.

50:20.240 --> 50:22.240
A lot of web developers use Macs just because of that.

50:22.240 --> 50:23.160
Because they have the Bash shell,

50:23.160 --> 50:24.880
they have a command line.

50:24.880 --> 50:25.960
So I've been shopping around,

50:25.960 --> 50:27.480
and with lots of help from our chat room,

50:27.480 --> 50:29.280
I've tried a lot of different distributions.

50:29.280 --> 50:31.760
Of course, your first one you go to is Ubuntu.

50:31.760 --> 50:32.960
A lot of people say Linux Mint,

50:32.960 --> 50:34.840
that's the most popular distribution right now

50:34.840 --> 50:36.360
on DistroWatch.

50:36.360 --> 50:38.360
But there's security reasons.

50:38.360 --> 50:40.240
Now I thought, when he mentioned the security reasons,

50:40.240 --> 50:41.880
what do you think he's gonna say?

50:41.880 --> 50:42.760
I always think he's gonna talk about

50:42.760 --> 50:43.760
the website hack, right?

50:43.760 --> 50:45.920
Not sure I wanna go with Linux Mint,

50:45.920 --> 50:48.200
they blocked some of the upstream updates and so forth

50:48.200 --> 50:49.760
for compatibility reasons.

50:49.760 --> 50:54.040
Ubuntu, also in a way, kind of gets out of date fast.

50:54.040 --> 50:55.360
If you do the stable release,

50:55.360 --> 50:57.760
you're gonna be out of date on a lot of stuff.

50:57.760 --> 50:58.880
I then I looked at Debian,

50:58.880 --> 51:02.120
which is what Ubuntu and Mint are based on.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.960
And that's a pretty nice operating system

51:03.960 --> 51:06.720
if you use the Debian stretch version.

51:06.720 --> 51:09.000
Debian has it right, they have a stable version

51:09.000 --> 51:11.640
that tends to be older, but is very rock solid.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.440
And then somebody told me,

51:14.440 --> 51:15.600
oh, you should use Arch Linux,

51:15.600 --> 51:16.840
that's a build it yourself Linux.

51:16.840 --> 51:18.640
And I did build an Arch system.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.160
You have to be a Linux guru to do it.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.680
And finally, somebody told me about this.

51:21.680 --> 51:22.520
This is-

51:22.520 --> 51:23.360
What?

51:23.360 --> 51:24.800
It's also like a backhanded compliment there.

51:24.800 --> 51:25.640
I did build it.

51:25.640 --> 51:26.520
You have to be a guru.

51:26.520 --> 51:29.000
Yeah, yeah, that's typical Leo.

51:29.000 --> 51:31.120
But then he discovers, Wes,

51:31.120 --> 51:32.480
I've done it across.

51:32.480 --> 51:33.320
You're out of date on a lot of stuff.

51:33.320 --> 51:34.160
I've done it across.

51:34.160 --> 51:35.200
And then I looked at Debian,

51:35.200 --> 51:38.480
which is what Ubuntu and Mint are based on.

51:38.480 --> 51:40.280
And that's a pretty nice operating system

51:40.280 --> 51:42.600
if you use the Debian stretch version.

51:42.600 --> 51:43.960
They have, Debian has it right,

51:43.960 --> 51:46.600
they have a stable version that tends to be older,

51:46.600 --> 51:48.000
but is very rock solid.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.800
And then somebody told me,

51:50.800 --> 51:51.960
oh, you should use Arch Linux,

51:51.960 --> 51:53.200
that's a build it yourself Linux.

51:53.200 --> 51:54.960
And I did build an Arch system.

51:54.960 --> 51:56.520
You have to be a Linux guru to do it.

51:56.520 --> 51:58.040
And finally, somebody told me about this.

51:58.040 --> 51:59.960
This is Antergos.

51:59.960 --> 52:02.840
Antergos is from Spain.

52:02.840 --> 52:07.840
And it is a Linux distribution that is Arch,

52:07.840 --> 52:10.800
but it's pre-configured to be very easy

52:10.800 --> 52:11.680
and friendly to use.

52:11.680 --> 52:14.400
And actually, I really, really like it.

52:14.400 --> 52:16.680
I put it on two machines now.

52:16.680 --> 52:19.960
And I think anybody looking to get both

52:19.960 --> 52:21.480
a rolling updated Linux,

52:21.480 --> 52:24.600
a Linux like Arch that is constantly up to date,

52:24.600 --> 52:28.400
but a user interface that is agreeable, easy to use.

52:28.400 --> 52:30.480
And remember, you've got a full,

52:30.480 --> 52:34.280
you know, free office suite, LibreOffice.

52:34.280 --> 52:36.520
You've got a lot of the tools that you use.

52:36.520 --> 52:37.800
If you put Chromium on it,

52:37.800 --> 52:39.440
that's identical to Google Chrome.

52:39.440 --> 52:42.400
In fact, you log in with Google and you sync it.

52:42.400 --> 52:43.400
Okay, NorthRanger.

52:43.400 --> 52:46.400
I think NorthRanger has the best comment on all of this.

52:46.400 --> 52:48.000
Will you share it with the class real quick?

52:48.000 --> 52:50.240
Cause that's, that's gorgeous.

52:50.240 --> 52:52.320
Yeah, this, yeah, go ahead.

52:52.320 --> 52:54.360
I am totally buying a lottery ticket right now.

52:54.360 --> 52:55.200
Yeah.

52:56.200 --> 52:57.160
Hell is freezing over.

52:57.160 --> 52:58.760
I don't know what's going on.

52:58.760 --> 53:01.240
What like, what bizarre alternate universe

53:01.240 --> 53:02.080
do we live in right now?

53:02.080 --> 53:04.720
I know, Microsoft's releasing Bash on Windows,

53:04.720 --> 53:08.840
Leo Leport's running Arch Linux on two computers.

53:08.840 --> 53:09.680
And loving it.

53:10.640 --> 53:12.440
Yeah, I mean, previously he said.

53:12.440 --> 53:15.560
Most of the web runs on servers powered by Linux.

53:15.560 --> 53:17.240
That's how reliable it is.

53:17.240 --> 53:19.760
Android phones are based on Linux.

53:19.760 --> 53:21.600
All Android phones run Linux.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.000
That's the operating system.

53:24.200 --> 53:26.400
You're probably using Linux all the time.

53:26.400 --> 53:27.840
Maybe you don't even know it.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.840
So you can get a free version of Linux.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.200
There are many, as I mentioned.

53:31.200 --> 53:32.480
So he's talked about it before.

53:32.480 --> 53:36.480
Not like he's new to Linux, but this is a big development.

53:36.480 --> 53:38.280
So I wanted to give him props for not only,

53:38.280 --> 53:40.120
not only trying it, but he apparently, you know,

53:40.120 --> 53:42.080
it sounds like I get the impression at least

53:42.080 --> 53:43.800
he's done his homework.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.240
He really does sound like he's curious

53:45.240 --> 53:46.880
and wants to use it.

53:46.880 --> 53:48.200
Yeah.

53:48.200 --> 53:49.880
He's dug in before.

53:49.880 --> 53:52.240
This is actually like probably his third update.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.640
That's, you know, impressive.

53:54.680 --> 53:56.440
My favorite one was when he first started

53:56.440 --> 53:58.280
really getting into, started doing it.

53:58.280 --> 54:01.400
It was an episode where he talked about Linux Mint

54:01.400 --> 54:02.840
when he was using it and he was talking about

54:02.840 --> 54:05.360
how Cinnamon was great and he was showing,

54:05.360 --> 54:07.280
this was really early on before he realized

54:07.280 --> 54:09.600
there was, you know, the security issues.

54:09.600 --> 54:11.960
But he was looking at it and saying like,

54:11.960 --> 54:14.600
this is great and the best part about when he was doing it

54:14.600 --> 54:17.840
is that he was showing Paul Therot on Windows Weekly.

54:17.840 --> 54:18.680
Nice.

54:18.680 --> 54:21.280
There you go.

54:21.280 --> 54:22.360
There you go.

54:22.360 --> 54:25.200
So props to Mr. Laporte.

54:25.200 --> 54:28.640
Now, Mr. Laporte, if you want to stop taking advice

54:28.640 --> 54:30.320
from your chat room and would like to learn more,

54:30.320 --> 54:33.480
I invite you to go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

54:33.480 --> 54:34.560
Be the real expert.

54:34.560 --> 54:35.960
Maybe you should tweet that to Leo.

54:35.960 --> 54:37.760
Leo, take your Linux skills,

54:37.760 --> 54:39.080
which apparently he's got some,

54:39.080 --> 54:41.560
and take them to the next level, right?

54:41.560 --> 54:44.280
I bet that next website could run on a system

54:44.280 --> 54:45.880
built by Leo Laporte if he goes over

54:45.880 --> 54:47.680
to linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

54:47.680 --> 54:51.800
Leo, they've got 2,364 video courses that you could take.

54:51.800 --> 54:53.320
I'm talking good stuff with downloadable,

54:53.320 --> 54:54.800
comprehensive study guides.

54:54.800 --> 54:56.720
You can take that and listen to it in the shower, Leo,

54:56.720 --> 54:58.800
which is really, according to my audience,

54:58.800 --> 54:59.960
the best time to do it.

54:59.960 --> 55:03.280
Scenario-based labs put you with hands-on experience

55:03.280 --> 55:05.480
in an environment just like the real world,

55:05.480 --> 55:07.960
so that way you walk away with real-world experience,

55:07.960 --> 55:09.560
and that would really help inform

55:09.560 --> 55:11.120
your commentary on the subject.

55:11.120 --> 55:12.520
Instructor mentoring is available,

55:12.520 --> 55:13.760
which if you think about it,

55:13.760 --> 55:16.360
from some of the competitors out there,

55:16.360 --> 55:18.120
not even really a serious offering,

55:18.120 --> 55:19.720
and they have instructor mentoring.

55:19.720 --> 55:22.040
Live streams, too, where you can do Q&A.

55:22.040 --> 55:23.640
A community that is stacked full

55:23.640 --> 55:24.880
of Jupiter Broadcasting members.

55:24.880 --> 55:28.280
Graded server exercises give you grades in real time.

55:28.280 --> 55:29.480
The entire Red Hat course,

55:29.480 --> 55:30.840
well, most of the Red Hat,

55:30.840 --> 55:32.000
and they're working on more all the time.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.240
Yes, they are. It is really cool.

55:33.240 --> 55:35.560
And I just recently heard from them

55:35.560 --> 55:38.560
that the OpenStack stuff is blowing up right now for them.

55:38.560 --> 55:41.360
The courseware is on OpenStack. Blowing up!

55:41.360 --> 55:43.600
Really, some of the best Amazon Web Service courseware, too.

55:43.600 --> 55:45.160
Now, that is legit. You should check that out.

55:45.160 --> 55:47.680
They are blowing the doors off of that.

55:47.680 --> 55:49.120
And if you want to go investigate

55:49.120 --> 55:51.160
that dark, murky world of DevOps,

55:51.160 --> 55:54.200
well, guess what? Linux Academy has courseware on that as well.

55:54.200 --> 55:56.520
They have a really cool system as well if you're busy.

55:56.520 --> 55:57.920
Say you're like Leo and you're recording

55:57.920 --> 56:00.520
like a dozen podcasts a week and you're on the air all the time.

56:00.520 --> 56:02.560
You don't have a lot of time to do all these courses.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.360
I understand that. Shoot, I'm busy, too, son.

56:04.360 --> 56:06.560
You know how many kids I got, Wes?

56:06.560 --> 56:07.920
Three.

56:07.920 --> 56:09.240
Yeah, Wes. That's a lot of kids.

56:09.240 --> 56:11.160
That's a lot of kids. Not enough time for Linux.

56:11.160 --> 56:12.160
No. So you know what I do?

56:12.160 --> 56:14.640
I use their availability planner to customize my coursework.

56:14.640 --> 56:16.840
Nice. I know. It is real nice.

56:16.840 --> 56:18.320
And plus, with their practice exams,

56:18.320 --> 56:20.560
I can feel like I can go in there and try something

56:20.560 --> 56:22.360
and make sure I got it right, which is good for me

56:22.360 --> 56:25.440
because I got that test anxiety.

56:25.440 --> 56:29.680
You know, except for an STD test because I don't feel like...

56:29.680 --> 56:30.800
Then you need to know.

56:30.800 --> 56:32.360
Yeah. And I don't feel like that's like a cue.

56:32.360 --> 56:34.480
That's not like when I got to get the question right or wrong.

56:34.480 --> 56:36.120
I should be pretty solid. They judge you either way.

56:36.120 --> 56:39.400
But I just, you know, they just prick me and it's done.

56:39.400 --> 56:40.920
But with this where I got to answer questions,

56:40.920 --> 56:42.640
I need a practice exam.

56:42.640 --> 56:44.880
Maybe I need...anyways.

56:44.880 --> 56:46.480
Enhanced learning plans are also available,

56:46.480 --> 56:48.720
which are really great because you can get a detailed learning plan

56:48.720 --> 56:50.600
with reminders and daily assignments, labs,

56:50.600 --> 56:52.640
quizzes that are doing things like that.

56:52.640 --> 56:55.080
It's a really awesome place built by people

56:55.080 --> 57:00.120
who are crazy passionate about Linux, linuxacademy.com.

57:00.120 --> 57:02.520
Go check them out, linuxacademy.com, slash, Unplugged,

57:02.520 --> 57:06.040
to save some money and support this here show.

57:06.040 --> 57:10.840
Okay. Odyssey Wester is going to be at Linux Fest Northwest to see who else.

57:10.840 --> 57:12.000
Blaster, are you still in there?

57:12.000 --> 57:13.720
Blaster is going to be at Linux Fest Northwest.

57:13.720 --> 57:16.200
Blaster gets here on Tuesday evening, actually.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.000
Oh, sweet.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.840
Yeah. So you're going to just have missed him

57:18.840 --> 57:21.640
because, yeah, he'll be in here after the show.

57:21.640 --> 57:24.440
Anybody else that I've missed that's going to be at Linux Fest Northwest

57:24.440 --> 57:26.440
in the Mamba Room? Hammer, you're in there.

57:26.440 --> 57:27.480
I'm going to be there.

57:27.480 --> 57:29.680
Who's that? Who's this?

57:29.680 --> 57:30.280
Richard.

57:30.280 --> 57:31.440
Oh, Richard, you're going to be there.

57:31.440 --> 57:31.920
Oh, great. Cool.

57:31.920 --> 57:33.520
Well, you should stop by the booth and say hi.

57:33.520 --> 57:34.640
That'd be really cool.

57:34.640 --> 57:35.640
Oh, I plan to.

57:35.640 --> 57:37.400
Oh, good. Good.

57:37.400 --> 57:40.040
And if you guys have Sousa beer koozies,

57:40.040 --> 57:41.000
you should bring one of those with you.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.720
Or bring one for Wes because he doesn't have one.

57:42.720 --> 57:44.880
I have one. But if you have them this year.

57:44.880 --> 57:48.720
Anybody else in the Mamba Room going to make it to Linux Fest?

57:48.720 --> 57:50.440
That's sad.

57:50.440 --> 57:52.680
If the network was crazy rich, I'd just like,

57:52.680 --> 57:55.880
you're all coming. That'd be so fun.

57:55.880 --> 57:56.800
Well, if you're going to make it.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.400
If North Ranger wins the lotto.

57:58.400 --> 57:59.920
Right. Yeah, maybe. Maybe.

57:59.920 --> 58:02.840
If you're going to make it, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

58:02.840 --> 58:04.240
and you'll find the event there.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.440
I have it linked directly in the show notes.

58:05.440 --> 58:06.160
Oh, I should sign up right now.

58:06.160 --> 58:08.840
That'd be cool. That'd be cool.

58:08.840 --> 58:12.760
This is where I think we'll eventually coordinate some of our game plan,

58:12.760 --> 58:16.640
which I'm a little hesitant because Emma could technically just sign up herself

58:16.640 --> 58:17.840
and then get access to everything.

58:17.840 --> 58:18.680
Don't tell her.

58:18.680 --> 58:20.000
I'm sure she's thought of that.

58:20.000 --> 58:20.920
Aye, she's smart, yeah.

58:20.920 --> 58:24.680
Yeah, so I don't know exactly, but I feel like at the same time,

58:24.680 --> 58:27.200
we have to do in a way that is approachable to the audience.

58:27.200 --> 58:28.800
You know, this is a real conundrum for me.

58:28.800 --> 58:33.120
My need for absolutely dominating this contest is interfering with my need

58:33.120 --> 58:35.280
to share with the audience of where to be at.

58:35.280 --> 58:36.280
You see what I mean?

58:36.280 --> 58:38.000
I do. Yeah. Yeah.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.200
But anyways, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting,

58:40.200 --> 58:41.400
at least this is the starting point.

58:41.400 --> 58:43.520
And then maybe once we'll...

58:43.520 --> 58:44.800
I got it.

58:44.800 --> 58:47.720
We use this to coordinate the in-person meetup place

58:47.720 --> 58:50.240
and then from then on, everything's in person.

58:50.240 --> 58:51.760
Right. Then you can tell if she's there or not.

58:51.760 --> 58:52.880
Yeah, that's how we're going to do it.

58:52.880 --> 58:53.880
Just don't tell her the secrets.

58:53.880 --> 58:54.360
There you go.

58:54.360 --> 58:56.920
And plus, you know, you could also, if you're just going to make it to Linux Fest,

58:56.920 --> 58:58.440
even if you're not going to make it for anything else,

58:58.440 --> 59:00.280
if you're just going to go there, let us know.

59:00.280 --> 59:03.640
I know more than 22 of you are going because here's a funny thing

59:03.640 --> 59:05.120
that the audience always does to me.

59:05.120 --> 59:07.400
It's a nice joke they play on Chris and it's super funny

59:07.400 --> 59:08.760
because it happens every year.

59:11.960 --> 59:15.440
30, 40, 50, 60 people will sign up for the meetup page.

59:15.440 --> 59:18.000
500 people will come and shake my hand.

59:18.000 --> 59:21.240
So where were the rest of you?

59:21.240 --> 59:22.240
Why didn't the rest of you...

59:22.240 --> 59:23.480
Now, I know you're busy.

59:23.480 --> 59:24.280
I understand.

59:24.280 --> 59:25.880
But seriously, like...

59:25.880 --> 59:26.760
He's very friendly.

59:26.760 --> 59:30.320
I do this every year and like 60, 70 people sign up on the meetup page

59:30.320 --> 59:31.960
and we're like, oh, we're going to have 60 or 70 people.

59:31.960 --> 59:35.360
So we get like, you know, a hundred things of a swag item just in case.

59:35.360 --> 59:36.040
Right.

59:36.040 --> 59:40.880
And then 500 people show up and it's like, OK, all right.

59:40.880 --> 59:41.640
Nice.

59:41.640 --> 59:45.480
And literally last year, it might have literally been a thousand people.

59:45.480 --> 59:48.160
And I don't know how many people it was anyways.

59:48.160 --> 59:51.680
My point is, if you could take a moment out of your busy day

59:51.680 --> 59:54.200
and go over to meetup.com as you put a broadcasting.

59:54.200 --> 59:55.320
Let us know that we're going to see you.

59:55.320 --> 59:56.520
Yeah, I'd like to know.

59:56.520 --> 59:57.480
It'd be nice.

59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.800
I'm not trying to give you a hard time here, but I'm just saying it'd be nice.

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:03.360
So in preparation for Linux Fest Northwest,

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.800
we're going to go pick up Mr. Ham Radio.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.400
And I'm kind of I'm looking forward to this because it's been a little while

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.640
since I got to spend any time at all in Idaho.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:18.440
And so nice ham radio here, who is often in the Mamba room with us.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.080
He's often in the chat room as well.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:25.320
He he is one of our newer editors.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:29.160
And he kind of does some of the extra stuff you guys will be seen in the future,

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:32.360
some stuff you've seen in the past, and he's going to help us

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.800
and Rekai go through a lot of our footage from Linux Fest.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.280
And so we're in the chat room right now.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.840
And so, yeah, like Blaster just said,

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.640
Operation Ham Holland will take place very soon.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.040
We're going to Noah and I and my lady got the ham.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.960
Oh, that's a really great idea, actually, and bring it with us.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.600
So Noah is going to arrive next Saturday.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.880
Yeah, probably late in the night.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.520
He's going to stay up.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.240
Probably do that thing he always does where he travels,

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.920
where he stays up for 24 hours like a jerk.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.440
Oh, fun.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.360
Yeah, he likes to do that.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.280
But then, you know, the nice thing is he gets to go here's his logic is then

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.720
he gets to sleep in a hotel room where he has where there's no kids.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.640
It's just him.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.440
And he just sleeps like he's never slept in like close the blinds.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:10.200
Yeah, he's out, too.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:13.440
So he actually has a he actually has a bit of a plan there.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.960
But he's going to fly in super late Saturday.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.480
Next Sunday is a big episode for the Linux action.

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.080
He'll be in.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.360
Not only will he be in studio, which means I might need rotten.

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.120
I don't know if we need to think about frame changes for that or not.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.760
We might.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.920
He's going to be in studio and we're going to do a very special episode of Linux

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.280
action show.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.800
And then after that episode jumping in Lady Jupiter and we're driving over to

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.280
Idaho to go pick up Ham would be a couple day trip.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.720
Going to get back late Monday.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:48.040
Hopefully be able to do tech talk today on Tuesday morning and then we'll have

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:53.840
Noah here in studio for Linux unplugged on next Tuesday and Ham will be around

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:54.760
as well.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:59.040
So I thought, boy, wouldn't it be nice if on our on our when Noah and I head off

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:03.040
to go pick up Ham if people could watch our progress like last time at

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.920
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash Rover.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.360
So I have been talking about for a while setting up a track car server.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.880
And so I did just that.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.640
I went I went and I downloaded track car T R A C car dot org and they have

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:21.400
downloads for Windows and Linux and even Linux arm and the Mac.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.080
And the installation West is it's pretty interesting.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:27.280
It's not your typical Linux software installation.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.400
When you download it you download their zip file.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.080
Right.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:35.120
And you need to have you need to have open JD key said I have for mine at

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.120
least I don't know what you need.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.360
I don't want to tell you for what I did tell you what to do.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.000
I installed open JDK seven Jerry headless.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.240
That's the package on Ubuntu.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.320
I have it in the show notes and then I installed unzip.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:53.760
I unzip the package and then you run like they just have a little dot run

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.520
file little script.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.400
So you run the track card at run file and it just goes off right in all of

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.400
your file system.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.960
You know.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:06.400
Oh you got a package manager screw you screw you and your package manager.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.000
Let me just put the oh I see you have you have an old style in it system.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.520
Let me stuff these right here.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.080
I'll stuff these in your net system.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.440
Oh good you have an op directory.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.280
Well I'm think thanks for running me as root.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:20.320
I'll go right on my stuff to your to your op directory.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.080
And then if you don't have of course because it's not using your package

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:27.360
manager if you don't have the Java packages installed there's no air right.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.520
Well no no no air until you try to start the day man and by and their website

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.000
instructions tell you to just reboot your machine like I'm going to reboot my

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.520
entire server so that way I can start your day man which you don't need to do

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.520
that.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.920
There is a day man in just your op directory you can just go run it

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.480
yourself and then it creates it creates a website for you with really poor

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.360
security that you can access from any computer in the world.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.360
Show us Chris.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:53.360
I will.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.960
Because why not Wes because who cares about security.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:03.760
So right now I have it running on my digital ocean droplet and I have a

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.720
car called L.J. tracker for lady jubes and it's running on my Internet phone

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.760
six and you can see I can zoom in right here and it's right here in the studio

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.080
and here's that.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.080
So here's the Internet phone West.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:19.920
I'll just show you the UI so you can see it and it's kind of neat because it

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.560
keeps a log of when it's pinged to see on the phone here.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.200
It keeps a log of when it's pinged the server.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:25.200
Oh neat.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.740
And the settings to set it up are.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.000
That's all you have to do.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.400
It's like five lines you fill in.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.400
Beautiful.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.400
That's beautiful.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.400
Thank you.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.400
All right.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.960
So I so that just runs now in the background on the Internet phone and it

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:43.720
updates the track car server which is really a job app and you can add as many

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.860
devices you want and you can have as many users as you want with their own

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:47.860
device list.

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:48.860
Oh wow.

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:51.280
And you can set some server defaults a couple of things I really like about it

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:55.880
right off the bat is by default can keep track of everyone at Linux fest your

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:57.720
crew make sure you know right where they could.

01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.440
Yeah if we will actually we could if we wanted to do that which may be helpful

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:04.400
for people get lost but one of the things I like right off the bat is it's

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.800
using open street maps for the for the map and at least in my area the open

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:11.800
street map stuff is just real beautiful well labeled.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800
It looks nice.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:13.800
Yeah it really does.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.320
Wes and the other thing is you can.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.320
This has this.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:21.400
This has a server API so you could also overlay it with Bing Maps or Google

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.560
Maps or whatever you want if you prefer those and their satellite data or

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.560
something like that.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.520
It gives me extremely accurate longitude and latitude positioning.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.320
So yes that is the longitude and latitude of the studio.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.760
Yes that is public information.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:37.240
I know it's on the stream right now and it tells you how fast the tracking

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:41.660
device is moving which right now is zero miles per hour and it gives you the

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.480
address there but that's actually that's funny that's actually not the address

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.820
of the studio the I would imagine the longitude latitude coordinates are

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:51.160
correct but that is that is not actually the address of the studio but that

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.160
would just be open.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.480
That's just its guess based on the open street map data.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:59.120
Now here's something that I'm majorly bummed about because all of that's

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:02.360
really cool and it took me about you know 30 minutes to get it all set up and

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:04.660
it works for Android too you don't have to have an internet phone from

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:05.660
Apple.

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:06.660
Nice.

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:07.660
Yeah.

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:12.720
Here's the major bummer and I just did not expect this.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:16.720
They don't have any facility for embedding the map in your own web page.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.720
No easy link.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:18.720
No.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:23.040
As Popey knows is like the entire intention of why I'm doing this and he

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.480
had he wrote you see he did it correctly as he wrote his own because he's so

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:30.520
fancy with it with the Ubuntu touch over there right and I just wanted I wanted

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.140
to use track car because it just seemed like a nice easy straightforward

01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:34.140
solution.

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:35.600
Someone's already done the hard work for you.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:41.040
Yeah and so doing a little research I've discovered there is a way to I guess

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.800
and I don't really understand how this works but you can embed a Google map on

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:49.560
your own website and then you can overlay data on top of it okay and the

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:55.200
track car server can act as that API source for the data my track car server

01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.780
has an API now and if I knew how to embed a Google map and overlay data from

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:04.440
an external API I could embed that on the Jupiter broadcasting comm slash

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:08.040
rover page okay so do it basically I'm gonna punt that to the audience to know

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.760
if anybody knows what the hell I'm talking about and you know how to do that

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:16.940
I would please let me know telegram me at Chris LAS on telegram I can't

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:21.760
telegram you because one of you bastards trolled my account but you can tell me

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:25.440
and then if you I think if you telegram me like I knew I wanted to say something

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:29.320
to wimpy like a couple of weeks ago like super bad I wanted to relay something to

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:33.160
wimpy and I can't I can't message him I can only I can only message wimpy when

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:36.320
he messages me first and then I can reply to wimpy but I can't met I can't

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:41.800
initiate the conversation I totally yeah yeah it does suck it does really suck

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.920
because I had something I really wanted to tell you but not and I've completely

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.280
forgotten what it was now but my point is if you know let me let me know either

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.200
hit me up in the chat room or actually ping Rekai in the chat room if you're

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.400
gonna do it via the IRC or hit me up on telegram because I'm just because of

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.080
everything that's going on Twitter would actually be fine too but I'm not checking

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:04.560
email very much for the next few days because I'm running around like crazy I

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:08.080
would love to get that set up those who people could watch and then because I've

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:11.520
wanted what I've been using in the meantime is a proprietary solution that

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.400
uses a dedicated piece of hardware and a monthly service fee that's a couple

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.120
hundred dollars for like three months or something like that there's no open

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:22.480
source anywhere no and I want every component of lady Jupiter to be as open

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.520
source as possible and I've even to some extent had to put things in and roll them

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:30.480
back to try to accomplish that and then eventually I mean this is like it

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.900
probably a 2017 thing but eventually I'd love to do an episode on a fully you

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:39.640
know open source setup that I've set up and I feel like this I shouldn't open

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:43.560
rover I should write and I shouldn't implement anything that isn't open source

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:49.040
today if I'm trying to get it all right so I bought this thing this tracker for

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.780
the first road trip and then it because I'd prepaid for the service at all and I

01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:55.520
knew this at the time it also covered the scale road trip so that worked out

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.440
perfectly so I just used the same proprietary thingy because I had paid

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.760
for the service but now my service is done and it's like it's like several

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:06.560
hundred dollars if you guys want it's silver cloud tracker if you're

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.640
interested if you want the thing that was appealing to me is it's a dedicated

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:15.400
hardware device you know and then you can embed their web app and they had

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:19.880
really pretty decent support too anyways but now I'm done with that and I'd

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:24.080
rather just have an app that runs on the background on my phone and and then just

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:27.000
have something I could embed on the website so if you have any any idea on

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.360
how the hell I could actually accomplish that just just let me know and and

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:34.320
blaster and ham radio I got good news for you guys while you guys are out here

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:38.040
we're gonna have a big turkey feed what yeah we did Thanksgiving for Dylan's

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:42.680
birthday last week because that's his favorite meal and so we and I just got

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:47.720
this huge turkey because we had a whole bunch of people over but people snacked

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:51.880
and stuff so there's a whole bunch of turkey leftover and we're gonna have

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.040
like turkey enchiladas we're gonna have all kinds of stuff while the crews out

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:58.620
here so yeah we're gonna have a good time when everybody's out here and I'll

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:01.640
be on the road and hopefully you guys have built a track that so if you tune

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:06.040
it for next week's unplugged it should be quite the show I would I would try to

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.140
catch that one lives probably gonna be a lot of shenanigans going on in the

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.880
studio that day it'll probably simmer down by the time the show's on the air

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.980
but if you could make a live next week would be a good when you go to Jupiter

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:18.640
broadcasting comm slash calendar for your lifetime but I got I got a feeling

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:22.160
like what I'll probably do is I'll probably jump out for a little bit for

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.320
like a segment or two and let Noah sit in or something you know we can rotate

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.900
out or something I know we'll figure it out we can tag team we'll tag team the

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:34.240
hosting or something like that yeah all right guys is it any mumble room is

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.800
there anything else from the virtual lug we want to cover before we wrap up on

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.520
this week's episode of the unplugged program I turn over you guys for one a

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:45.080
two a three no that's how many licks it takes to get to the center of the

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:50.200
unplugged lollipop you ever seen that commercial oh yeah all right

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.840
all right so I'm really I'm really looking forward to next week I'm super

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.960
excited Sunday's a big show I hope you guys can catch Sunday's episode of the

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:00.600
Linux action show if you're turning in live on Thursday we got the double tech

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:04.040
snaps coming up a lots going on it's crazy and it's a lot a lot of good

01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.400
content even if you can't make it in these events it's we're gonna make them

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:12.360
we're gonna put the very best stuff I want anything but JB it's crazy West

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.680
there's not time no time no no all right you were broadcasting comm slash calendar

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.280
for our lifetimes Linux action show dot reddit comm for feedback Jupiter

broadcasting comm slash contact for email and we'll see you right back here

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:43.680
next Tuesday

01:11:52.720 --> 01:12:22.500
And with that, I say get it out of here.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:23.500
Because that is the end of the show.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.500
All right.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.500
Thank you, Mumbroom.

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:26.500
Yeah, guys.

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:27.500
You're welcome.

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:28.500
Thank you.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:29.500
You're welcome.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:30.500

Boop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-a-doop-do-do-do-do-do-do.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:38.880
Wimpy, your Mate edition of the Ubuntu distribution, I'm not sure if you're familiar with this,

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:39.880
but this is-

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.580
Something you've been doing for a while now.

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.800
The hype is strong with the 16.04 release.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:49.880
I can't believe how many websites I'm seeing right about it.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:55.700
Probably from basically Network World, Matt, you got Softpedia, you got-

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:56.700
Network World?

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:57.700
Yeah.

01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:59.460
Or maybe it was PC World, maybe?

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:00.460
One of them.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:01.460
Somebody wrote some from-

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:02.460
Oh, okay.

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:03.460
I'll miss that one.

01:13:03.460 --> 01:13:04.460
I know.

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:07.620
I blare all the World ones together, but I tell you what.

01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:08.620
The-

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:09.620
It's awesome.

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:10.620
Yeah.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:16.700
It's like, I mean, I almost wonder if it's overshadowing the other main release.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:22.300
I think the reason it gets so much hype is because, really, in my experience of actually

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:29.820
using Ubuntu Mate, it really feels like what Ubuntu should have been had it stuck with

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:30.980
its original path.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:31.980
All right, all right.

01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:36.260
But what about handy Linux, right?

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:37.260
The distro that gives you-

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:38.260
Get handy with handy Linux.

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:39.260
Yeah, get handy with-

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:43.180
Okay, so it's a Debian without the headaches, right?

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:47.460
Based on Debian GNU slash Linux, you heard of that, lightweight and stable XFC desktop

01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:48.460
environment.

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:52.180
Handy Linux is safe, convenient, and free of charge.

01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:54.940
Now that's a distro with a name.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:55.940
That's a brand right there.

01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:56.940
Yes, it is.

01:13:56.940 --> 01:14:00.140
And look, it even has a hand as its logo.

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:05.900
Yeah, I was reading today on Google Plus that the Fedora project is working on it, and I

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:09.580
guess there's just certain syscalls that maybe aren't even implemented yet.

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:14.300
So it might be a more narrow range that the Ubuntu user line is using than we suspected.

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:18.260
So it sounds like OpenSUSE guys are thinking about it, but it's like a trial and error

01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:19.260
stage right now.

01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:20.820
So no art show in there yet?

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:23.980
Yeah, because I'm wondering, like, who's the next distro?

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:27.700
You know it's going to be some distro that's going to be the one that announces, we got

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:29.900
it running on the Windows Linux subsystem.

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:32.620
Well, if there's some choice, I'll be more excited to try it.

01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:37.020
We've been able to retask the build service to basically pump out what should be viable

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:41.660
images because we have similar use cases we've already been playing with for that.

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:45.660
So like, dump out an OpenSUSE user space, we build our docker images that way, all that

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:46.660
kind of stuff.

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:47.660
Ah, yeah, brilliant.

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:48.660
Yeah.

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:49.660
Yeah.

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.980
So that's been the final easy part.

01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:56.180
So yeah, it's just figuring out those syscalls and poking around those parts.

01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:58.020
I would like to see it.

01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:03.020
The same stage as Fedora, but we've managed to get bits and pieces of Tumbleweed and bits

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.420
of pieces of Gleap on that.

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:05.420
Huh.

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:06.420
Well, that's a start.

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:07.420
That's exciting.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.420
That's great.

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:09.420
Yeah, that'll be fun.

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:13.220
That could be like, I don't know, like, the next time I ever have to install Windows 10,

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:14.420
that might be something I'd like to play with it.

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:15.420
Right.

01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.420
So you got a while.

01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:19.420
WinArch 10.

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:21.700
I kind of wonder if it'll be Arch, but see, I don't think so.

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:26.720
I think this is probably not going to be Arch's strong suit unless a really savvy developer

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.900
out there does it for the distro, right?

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:34.340
But see, some of the more structured distros sort of have an advantage here, I should think.

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:40.420
Yeah, you need a way of getting your root file system deployed on there.

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.420
Yeah.

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:42.420
Yeah.

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:43.420
Well, you see-

01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:44.420
What is an Arch root file system?

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:50.300
You see examples of people reloading DigitalOcean droplets to different distributions while

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:51.300
it's loaded.

01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:52.300
Right.

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.300
The BSD guys on BSD now have talked about doing that too, swapping between BSDs.

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.980
They could learn about Linux too.

01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:58.740
And so you wonder if it could be done from within.

01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:02.700
In fact, you almost would have to do it from within the Ubuntu environment, is sort of

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:03.700
replace it from within.

01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:04.900
Package your own Windows app.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:07.140
Well, because you can't get into the App Store.

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:11.580
And when you install the subsystem, I believe it pulls it down as soon as you try to run

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:12.580
it or something.

01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:14.740
It's not really coming from an App Store.

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:19.660
It says it is, but it's lying and coming from a plain old website.

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:20.660
So you can man in the middle of that.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:21.660
Yeah, just on an Azure server.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.420
You can man in the middle of that, no problem.

01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:25.420
That's true.

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.420
Oh, that's a good point.

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.540
You could just do a little DNS trick or something.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.420
Add this line to your host file.

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:33.420
That's what I've guys did, yeah.

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:34.420
Blaster.

01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:37.900
If I could just inject for a moment, what you've been referring to as Windows NT is

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:38.900
actually GNU-slash-Windows-NT.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:39.900
Very good, sir.

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:40.900
Very good.

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:41.900
I've been corrected.

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:42.900
Windows NT.

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:49.140
Yeah, that's an interesting point.

01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:52.860
You can fire up Yast from some pretty peculiar angles.

01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:57.420
I did that before with some host.

01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:01.980
It wasn't DigitalOcean, but yeah, they didn't provide an open SUSE image, so I took their

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:05.060
Debian image, hacked around with it, grew up without it, booted into Yast and nothing

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:06.060
else.

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.060
Yeah.

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:08.060
That's good.

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:14.300
I'm sure it's been said a number of times, but isn't it amazing how much of a proof

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:20.260
this is that Linux has won when the Linux API system is used in Linux, it's used in

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:23.860
VSD, and now it's used in Windows.

01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:26.700
It's kind of like the universal app platform.

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:29.380
Yeah, I think so.

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:34.380
That or it makes it extremely easy for its competitors to integrate, embrace, and extend.

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:35.380
I don't know.

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:36.380
Come on, glass half full, Chris.

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:37.380
You're right.

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:38.380
You're right.

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:43.660
I don't think I know anyone who's tried it yet.

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:48.300
Actually I've installed the Ubuntu bash on Windows 10 to try it out.

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:49.620
How'd that go?

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:54.900
Well, I installed Clang and built a C binary just to try it out.

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:55.900
It actually worked.

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:56.900
Pretty sweet.

01:17:56.900 --> 01:18:04.460
I can update and upgrade, not dist-upgrade, but just upgrade.

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:07.220
And is it a 15.10 environment?

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:10.500
No, 14.04 at the moment.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.060
Oh, right, right, right, right.

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:16.180
And so will you be doing a dist-upgrade to go to 16.04?

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:17.180
How does that work?

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:18.180
I'll give it a shot.

01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:22.620
I'm not messing around with it too much because, you know.

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:29.300
Well, okay, I had to kind of use the latest snapshot image in order to actually update

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:35.140
the Windows 10 laptop that I've got because it just didn't want to do the upgrade to the

01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:36.380
actual build.

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:41.980
So I just kind of overrode it to get the bash on Windows thing.

01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:43.700
So it actually does work.

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:47.940
I've upgraded, just tried a few binaries or at least compiling a few things.

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:52.740
I haven't done too much beyond that, but it works apparently.

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:57.660
I'm getting really, you know, for me personally, I just couldn't care less about Windows 10

01:18:57.660 --> 01:18:58.660
in so many ways.

01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:00.460
It's still, it's so Windows still.

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:01.460
It doesn't matter.

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.900
You know, I was thinking about this recently.

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:09.580
Microsoft will have truly changed when they have one version of Windows for all systems.

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:13.460
If you want to run it on a server, you want to run it on a desktop, they don't have enterprise

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:17.500
and data center because look at the way the market's going.

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:20.900
Microsoft, when they started as a company, they were one of the first companies to figure

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:25.500
out you could take the same exact code and if you're just a smart enough business major,

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:29.580
you could sell that same code to people who will pay $3,000 for it because they're in

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:33.060
a business and they depend on it and you can sell it to people who will pay $100 for it

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:36.640
because they're a consumer and they don't require it as much and it's the same damn

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.740
stuff with artificial limitations.

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:42.780
And they were some of the people that just brilliantly made obviously a lot of money

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:43.780
off that.

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:50.180
And now they are in an era where things are in the cloud and those kinds of little divisions

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:56.220
and things are on mobile and that little artificial limitation seems trivial and obvious now.

01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:58.340
And the rest of the world has realized it.

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:01.140
Apple realized it for God's sakes before Microsoft did.

01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:05.820
And Apple is the company that charged their beta users to do upgrades originally and then

01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:08.180
Steve Jobs came out and claimed, well, we have to do it.

01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:09.180
It's an accounting rule.

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.180
We have to charge you.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:12.420
And then two years later, they dropped the charging.

01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:15.500
So Apple figures it out before Microsoft does.

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:18.680
And so Microsoft is still trying to sell this differentiator product.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:21.580
But you know, at the end of the day, it's still the same crap product.

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:22.860
I have a close family member.

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.700
I didn't even know this.

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:29.660
I'm actually very sort of upset about it.

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:33.860
Their parent went out and bought them a Windows 10 laptop at Best Buy.

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:34.860
And they're all excited.

01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:38.460
They came over for Dylan's birthday party and they're like, hey, Chris, look, it's my

01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:39.460
laptop.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.300
It's got the new Windows 10 on it.

01:20:41.300 --> 01:20:42.660
Isn't that great?

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:44.220
It's got the new Windows 10.

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.640
I'm like, wow, they really got sold.

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.780
So how's it been going?

01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:52.300
And so Dylan, you know, he brings down his elementary OS Sputnik and he fires it up.

01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:55.020
And you know, this is the same exact install that Dylan's had since I gave it to him for

01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:56.020
his last birthday.

01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:57.900
So it's now over a year old.

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:00.780
And he fires up Minecraft and he's got all his mods installed.

01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:02.780
He's like, come on, let's play.

01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:04.700
And he's like, oh, I can't.

01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:05.700
And Dylan's like, why not?

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:09.860
Well, I got a virus a few days ago and we took it in a geek squad to replace it.

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:12.820
And they had to format my computer and they lost all my worlds.

01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:15.380
And we haven't been able to get Minecraft reinstalled since then.

01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:19.220
But I got a geek squad shirt.

01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:20.220
It's the same.

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:21.220
Wow.

01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:41.600
And it looks just like the round reflect, but they actually add it for the game as

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.700
well.

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:46.860
I just love this thing.

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:50.960
It looks pretty cool.
