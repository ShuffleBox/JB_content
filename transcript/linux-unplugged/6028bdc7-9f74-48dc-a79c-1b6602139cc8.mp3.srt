1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Wes found something that I'm gonna be using the heck out of, but potentially, it's YouTube DL

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,920
web server. It's a web server for downloading YouTube videos. You fire up a Docker container,

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,520
you give it a YouTube URL, and it's pretty much off to the races. You then are re-hosting your own

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,640
downloaded instances of the YouTube videos. And I think right now one of the things it does is

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,320
it re- or transcodes, I guess would be the way to put it. Not re-encode, but it transcodes

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,680
them to mp3. So then you can download them from a web UI as mp3 files, which kind of be a cool way

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,760
to convert long videos into like a podcast. You know, and there are things to do this,

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,200
various sites out there or bookmarklets or just the command line. But if you're like me,

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,360
you have others in your life who frequently have sources that are YouTube videos. I can't be

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,280
bothered to ffmpeg them mp3s all the darn time. So here you go. Pop it in that web UI and you're

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,120
off to the races. Now, of course, right now you can't really choose, you know, does it give you

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,440
the full video? And there's a ton of options. There's dash videos, there's, you know, YouTube

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,840
has a lot of downloading options. So hopefully those features show up in a later release. I've

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,680
got a very, oh, so shameful bash version of this that I have been using. So maybe after the show,

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,840
I can replace it. Yeah, I love YouTube DL. And this just makes it even better and more

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,520
accessible to friends and family and lazy Chris, which lazy Chris always appreciates making things

17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:37,440
a little easier. This is Linux Unplugged, episode 268 for September 25th, 2018.

18
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,920
Ooh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's got a studio full of brown bears.

19
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,280
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes. We have a packed show today, multiple guests

20
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,800
stopping by the show, some community news, and something that we don't get to enough,

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,000
the audience's feedback and emails and questions. We'll do a little bit of that too, do some follow

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,080
up on some recent topics. And I'll tell you about a new rig that just showed up in the studio.

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,560
It's a monster. I haven't told you about it yet. So I'm excited. I'll tell you in the show,

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,640
you'll get to find out. So, and maybe the most important thing at all, on top of all this,

25
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,680
is after the show, we're going to do an unplugged barbecue. Noah's in town. He's hanging out at the

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,880
studio. Wes is here. He's brought his pups. We're going to go get Levi, go get some food.

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,040
There's some meat in the cooker right now. This is prep for the big public barbecue we

28
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,840
want to do once I'm back up on my feet, feeling better. Got to get it right in before the holidays.

29
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,840
So the timing is going to be tricky. So this will be our test run at a big barbecue,

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,440
a big community barbecue. We'll do a trial. I mean, you got to rehearse if you want to get it right.

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,600
You already got the sous vide going. Yeah, that's right. All right. Well, before we get any farther

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,760
into the show, you know what we got to do. We got to bring in that virtual lug. Time,

33
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:02,640
appropriate greetings, mumble room. Amazing. We have a great turnout in there. Mr. Dahr is back.

34
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,040
Brent's there, of course. Cassidy from Elementary OS. Longtime contributor Eric is there. Hayden is

35
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,320
here from an interesting project we'll be talking about in just a little bit. Mr.

36
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,800
Minimac, true contributor to the, I mean, needs no introduction. Just here all the time. And

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,680
returning to the show, Mr. Ryan Sipes. Ryan, welcome back to the show. It's good to be back.

38
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,120
We got Sean in there and TechMav as well. So we got a big crew today. We're really looking

39
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,920
forward to today's episode. So let's start with the thing that people are sort of the most on edge

40
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,280
about this week. We'll just get this out of the way. People are pretty upset that Google seems to

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,280
be, quote, secretly logging users into Chrome whenever they log into a Google property. So you

42
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,920
go into Docs, you go to Gmail. I do that all the time. You go to YouTube. Yeah, right. I mean,

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,120
what don't they own? Starting with Chrome 69, whenever a Chrome user would access a Google

44
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,720
own site, the browser would take that user's Google identity and log the user into the Chrome

45
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,480
browser account system. Now with this revelation, obviously there's a large number of users who are

46
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,600
just kind of angry. It feels like a sneaky behind the back modification. And you worry that it could

47
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,400
allow Google to link your traffic to a specific browser and then to a specific account. And as

48
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,240
someone with multiple Google accounts, there's some things I searched that, well, maybe not

49
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,680
necessarily bad. I don't need on my work account. Right. Well, and Dar in the mumble room today was

50
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,240
just talking about on the pre show about how he's on a machine that shared by multiple people. So

51
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,120
how does that work now when multiple people sit down? Is it bouncing between Google accounts every

52
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,960
time you change a Google sign? Somebody else sits down, logs into Gmail and now it's a different

53
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,480
account signed into the browser. That's a very good question. Now there is something we should

54
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,000
be clear about here. Google engineers have clarified that this auto login operation does not

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,560
start the process of synchronizing local data to Google servers. That still requires you to

56
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,400
explicitly click something. Right. Exactly. That's a big difference. Yeah. Oh, sorry. I forgot to

57
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,120
call out Alex. Mr. Ironic Badger is also sorry, Alex. I didn't mean to skip you. I just don't read

58
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,880
the screen very well from that far away. I know, you know, and I, we and I were just, we're just

59
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,360
having a nice chat too. So, well, I'm very glad you're here. It's nice to see you. Alex, of course,

60
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,560
was, he was joining us for quite a while after Texas Linux Fest, but then took some time off to

61
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,800
travel to the States and move to the States, uh, down in a Raleigh area. So, and I'm now dealing

62
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,800
with establishing a us credit history, which is unbelievably pain in the ass territory. Welcome.

63
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,840
Our sympathies, sir. Um, then there's another thing that's now brewing today. Uh, Christoph

64
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,120
Tavin tweeted out that when you clear all cookies in the new version of Google Chrome,

65
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,240
it clears out all cookies except for the Google cookies. Um, and to be clear, what it actually

66
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,000
seems to do is it wipes out all of the cookies on your file system and then immediately recreates

67
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,120
the cookies for Google's properties and repopulates them. Interesting. Now I did see some defense out

68
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,960
there. There's clearly some, some privacy implications here that people are rightfully

69
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,800
concerned about. I did see some people trying to justify it from the developer side of you,

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,240
you know, making the argument that, well, users are confused that they're logged into Chrome,

71
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,880
but they're not logged into our Google sites and vice versa. And then, well, once you,

72
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,560
if you are logged into the browser and you do clear your cookies on the very next request,

73
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,000
it's pretty much going to go check and be like, Hey, am I signed in? It's going to agree to grab

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,080
those cookies. So you can see them being like, well, it's simpler if we just warm them up front

75
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,560
that maybe those cookies aren't, are always going to be there. Yeah. It's, it's sort of like, uh,

76
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,720
in iOS when you turn on airplane mode now, it, it leaves Bluetooth on to connect to your watch or

77
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,600
your AirPods. There's not like true airplane mode anymore. And what that feels like to me

78
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:52,160
is design and product overruling engineering. I think the most accurate and cutting criticism

79
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,000
about both of these changes is that when asked, Google engineers could not articulate a very clear

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,440
reason why this change has happened and why it was kind of snuck in, which causes people to lose

81
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,280
trust. I think they cannot say what it is because Google hasn't made this public statement about it

82
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,640
and generally contracts for them to do so. So they were limited in what they could legitimately say.

83
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,880
I mean, they are making some suggestions, but they all don't really pass the sniff test. Yeah.

84
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,640
And do you think you're right? I mean, at this point, Chrome feels a bit more of like a Google

85
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,120
product that happens to have a browser inside of it and less of like a browser first sort of thing.

86
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,080
And it was the good engineering of a lot of Google's products that, you know, made me switch

87
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,080
to Chrome for a long time is it was a great browser initially. And that was because of great

88
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,720
engineering. Does anyone know is Chromium also affected by that or only the Chrome

89
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,000
proprietary version? Most likely it will be. Looks like it is on Chromium now.

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,520
Now, but I've also heard a lot of people saying they're using a version of Chromium that avoids

91
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,120
all of this. I think there's some patches out there to remove that. Yeah.

92
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,480
Know that Debian's version actually disables the Google services unless you go there manually

93
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,680
and enable them. So. Okay. Only the Debian version or also the Ubuntu version?

94
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,480
I can't talk for other stuff. I haven't tested it. Okay. Okay. So I have to check that.

95
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,800
Now, Cassidy, you point out that this behavior isn't necessarily new for some group of users.

96
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,640
Yeah. As far as I know, this is how it's been from day one on Chrome for Android. Like, and it

97
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,480
maybe it was a little more forthcoming on Android when you sign in. It says, Hey, we're also going

98
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,960
to sign you into the Chrome browser to sync your bookmarks and everything. So I don't know if

99
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,640
people are freaking out about it here on the desktop, why that's very different from freaking

100
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,360
out about it on Android. Yeah. I guess it does make it more in line with the Android version.

101
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,680
That's an interesting point. It's kind of a weird one. Yeah. We have different conceptions on our

102
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,640
different devices, I guess. You know, practically speaking, the very first thing I do is I log into

103
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,400
the Chrome browser. So this is not necessarily a move that I find personally offensive. I am

104
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,360
dumb enough, I guess. I don't know what people would label me who think Google is spying on them

105
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,040
constantly, but I am willing to risk it. And I use the sync service. I sync my history and my

106
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,360
bookmarks because I find that to be a very useful feature of the browser. And it's a good sync

107
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:15,040
system, too. So I just have been all in from day one when they turned that on. So I don't really

108
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,480
find this to be offensive, but I do understand people that are concerned about it. And it's just

109
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,640
good to know, you know, and assess when you do have options out there, which is nice. So when

110
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,120
you're looking when you're weighing Firefox versus Chrome, this is another data point. And I think

111
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,080
it's an important one. Something else that I found really handy in the past has been play on Linux.

112
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,520
Play on Linux is a wrapper around a series of scripts to make it really easy to install a lot of

113
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:44,480
different Windows applications and use Wine. I've been wondering where does Play on Linux go now

114
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,120
in a post-proton world? How about that, Wes? As a saying, a post-proton world. I like it.

115
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,920
So where does Play on Linux go? And it appears that they're making some massive changes. Alpha

116
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,280
One is out this week, along with a Play on Mac build as well. And there has been some big changes.

117
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,200
Play on Linux version 5.0 Alpha has been completely redesigned, a new user interface,

118
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,680
and a new platform they're calling, I guess, Phoenix? Am I saying that right? Phonics? I'm the

119
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,480
worst. I'm just the worst. I shouldn't be allowed to speak. The new platform is, quote, decentralized,

120
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,960
Git-based, and improves their script engine greatly. The new Alpha has support for about 135

121
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,760
different games right now. They're also investigating using virtualization or container

122
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,480
technologies to improve the gaming experience. So, hey. That could be interesting if you want

123
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,760
to isolate a series of libraries or a specific version of Wine. There's a bottle system now,

124
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,000
but that's more at the software layer. So this would be more at the systems layer. Yeah, so

125
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,200
something to keep an eye on, playonlinux.com for more. I've used it on and off over the years. I've

126
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,400
also used Crossover quite a bit over the years. And now it's like, well, how can these projects,

127
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,200
Proton, how can these projects, Play on Linux, and Crossover Office, integrate Proton?

128
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,120
Yeah, right. Can they further the value add and make it even easier to get some great games on

129
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,400
Linux? I suspect there might be a way, at least, to take some of the upstream improvements that

130
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,880
have been in Wine, and we'll probably start seeing those benefits. I'm curious to see where

131
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,080
that goes. There's another thing I'm also watching to see where this goes. It sort of seems to me

132
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,920
like elementary OS is positioning themselves as a family-safe, family-first distribution.

133
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,160
And I started thinking that after I read a post by Cassidy on their Medium blog about

134
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,960
App Center and content ratings that are coming in Juneau. They say, starting with Juneau,

135
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,920
Cassidy writes, will display a content warning when a user goes to download an app that meets

136
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,320
or exceeds a certain level of the OARS data. Think of that as like nudity, violence, and language

137
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,280
content. In addition, these apps will not be featured on the App Center homepage as recommended

138
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,480
installs. They will remain in the search results and category pages, so if you really want to find

139
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,640
them, they're definitely still there. And we should note here that they want to be clear that

140
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,720
elementary is not intending to be the content police. They could never make as informed of a

141
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,560
decision about what's acceptable as, you know, yourself or a parent of a child.

142
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,760
This is just a small step toward more robust content controls and informed consent, as they put it,

143
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
for their users. So Cassidy, this seems like an interesting differentiating feature of the

144
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,680
distribution, sort of making it safe for parents to deploy elementary OS for their kids. And it

145
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,920
seems like this could go much deeper than just the App Center too. Yeah, exactly, and that's the

146
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,880
plan. We've had parental controls in Loki now for a couple years, and it's, you know, it's kind of a

147
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,160
first take on the concept where you can set up certain restrictions for apps for a managed account.

148
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,600
But I think we're looking at these digital wellness features that we've talked about that are coming

149
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,640
to like Android and iOS, and we're kind of reconsidering how we could build this feature into

150
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,880
the OS itself for both child accounts, but also for people to be able to control what they're

151
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,640
comfortable installing or seeing in the OS. I was talking to somebody recently, and they said that

152
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,640
their friend has PTSD from like combat-related trauma. And so that's an example I gave here of,

153
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,880
you know, if you want to prevent yourself from seeing very violent content, you should have the

154
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,680
control over your OS to do that. And it's always in your hands to be able to do that.

155
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,320
And Ryan, you also are making the case it's not just for kids. Yeah, I just wanted to pair what

156
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,440
Cass said. We actually had a conversation about this the other day. My girlfriend is really

157
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,560
careful about this stuff, because she was over in Lebanon assisting Syrian refugees and was exposed

158
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,520
to a lot of, you know, violence. And so it really triggers her to see, you know, really graphic

159
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,600
violence. And so I think a lot of people benefit from being able to set what they're comfortable

160
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,080
with seeing and appearing in front of them on their own machine when they're using it.

161
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,200
Yeah, I hadn't thought about that, but that does make that makes a ton of sense.

162
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,080
It's not an angle we usually think of, right? Like, control usually means like,

163
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,480
I want unrestricted things, but restrictions for yourself, well, that's still control.

164
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,840
It's a new idea that we've played with a lot recently, mostly in the mobile context. Like,

165
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,520
should I start using the built-in OS features to limit screen time in the evening?

166
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,320
In some way, things like secure boot are almost analogous.

167
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right. We have sort of been building this, it's like, I don't mind

168
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,200
optional controls that I have total authority over that I can choose to put in place or not.

169
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,280
Like, that's totally fine in my book.

170
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,200
It points out problems in human social structures, right? We get a little nervous when we know those

171
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,840
controls are there and easy to use, especially when we're not in a situation where we have total

172
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,400
control.

173
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,760
I also think it's really important that we build these tools to put the control in the hands of

174
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,960
the users because if we don't build it in that way, I think there's too much of a temptation

175
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,280
for people to control it at the service level. For example, if, you know, we thought, oh,

176
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,680
we shouldn't have explicit content in the store, we might restrict all explicit content from the

177
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,800
whole app center. And I don't think that's the right way to go.

178
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,360
Ah, I see what you're saying is it also makes room for the other way. So there can be

179
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,880
content that is explicit, but there is an easy way for people to opt out of it.

180
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Right. So that's a great point. So Cassidy, I guess this is one of many new things that are

181
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,960
coming to Juno and we're kind of going to see this in the early stages, it sounds like with Juno.

182
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,080
It'll be specific to the app center in Juno, but then future releases expanding from there?

183
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,160
Yeah, the idea is kind of this tiered progression. At first, we're doing this kind of minimum

184
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,200
viable. It's just a warning that says, hey, here's a heads up, according to the data in the app,

185
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,840
that it has some explicit content. But after that, I think, yeah, we're going to look at

186
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:52,240
really building in both in app center itself, listing out what actual ors tags are there.

187
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,480
And so what, you know, whether it's explicit due to violence or nudity or language.

188
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,080
And then after that, yeah, in the future is more system-wide controls. So you can,

189
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,560
you know, this could theoretically apply to your video player or your music app as well.

190
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,240
That's an interesting idea. And I think, like I said at the beginning,

191
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,000
it's a good differentiator. I have found elementary OS to be a fantastic OS for my son.

192
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,200
It's been on his laptop now for a couple of years, at least. Just super solid. So I really

193
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,040
like this. And I plan to, you know, just keep them on elementary OS because it just

194
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,720
worked out perfectly. So great, Cassie. Well, thanks for coming on and explaining that.

195
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Man, am I looking forward to seeing Juno land. It's got to be getting close. You guys must be

196
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,640
in like the big final push, right? Yeah, it's coming. It's sure coming. I will say I've been

197
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,200
working on the big release announcement post, you know, because there are certain things we know

198
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,680
are obviously in this release and we can start taking some screenshots and things. But you are

199
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,920
in that phase. You're in that phase. It's like a 20 minute read right now. Wow. So it's intense.

200
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,080
There's a lot of new stuff, a lot of great stuff. Wow. Congratulations. Looking forward to it.

201
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,760
Thanks. Speaking of other new stuff, we've been covering the development of PipeWire,

202
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,920
which has recently had a couple of large growth spurts when it was adopted to provide remote

203
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:19,120
desktop access to GnomeShell and now to also the Plasma desktop for Wayland. This was always the

204
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,240
big question is, you know, I love X11's network capabilities. Wayland has nothing. How are we

205
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:32,640
going to achieve this? And PipeWire is a back end plumbing system, I guess, for video right now.

206
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:41,200
But that's about to change. PipeWire is going to also provide audio support. And that work has

207
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,960
started to be formed. There is pretty much everything in place they need for video,

208
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,880
including patches for Firefox and Chromium, which are in the development stages right now.

209
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:00,480
So the video part being pretty well solved, and at least at a near 1.0, the PipeWire creator

210
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,800
himself, Wim Tamus, and the pulse audio developer, core pulse audio developer, and a few others

211
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:13,360
are getting together at a hack fest this fall to start the core work on building what they're

212
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:20,320
calling a production audio pipeline for Linux. That's what that work is going to start at the

213
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,400
end of October. And they're traveling to Edinburgh, and they're all going to get together. And I think

214
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:33,360
this is a massive, massive moment, because macOS has a very competitive audio subsystem,

215
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,920
like core audio is what they call it. And Linux has gotten pretty good with pulse audio in Jack.

216
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,280
In fact, we use it extensively in production and are pretty happy with it these days. But I wouldn't

217
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,800
say it's a cohesive API that you can easily write to like core audio is. Right. I mean, you have

218
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,720
different use cases that are segregated, and a lot of your users will end up having to install

219
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,680
different software and learn how to configure it if they have a new use case. So Christian here is

220
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,840
blogging on one of the known blogs that I got off the known planet feed. And he writes that he's

221
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,240
feeling very optimistic that we can come out of this event with both a plan for what we want to do,

222
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,640
and the right people involved to make it happen. The idea is we can have a shared infrastructure

223
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,800
for consumer level audio and pro level audio. Under Linux, it really excites me he writes,

224
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,160
and I do believe that if we do this right, Linux will take a huge step forward as a natural home

225
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,200
for pro audio desktop users. Amazing. I'm that is really exciting. Now, of course,

226
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
it's really it's it's just early days. That's that's where it's at. We do have good audio

227
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,640
solutions. But this is what we need that we have had missing abstractions. And I think that's what

228
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:43,360
this is showing. And something to keep in mind is this solves the issue of a proper way of providing

229
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,280
audio and video hardware access for for sandboxed applications, which we're going to start seeing

230
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,040
more and more with flat packs and snaps and Wayland applications. This is going to be pretty

231
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,640
nice. Secondarily, it provides a unified solution for user space and pro audio, which means pro audio

232
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,280
users will no longer have to read all these crazy how tos and guides to get jack going on their

233
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,360
system, which is what Wes and I are doing right now. It will just be all be programmatically

234
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,480
achievable. And third, it provides a video equivalent of pulse audio, which makes dealing

235
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,840
with different cameras, screen capture and a lot of other things, including doing all that under

236
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,960
Wayland possible. So that's what pipeline is bringing is a unified audio and video subsystem

237
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,400
that works across sandbox applications, works with Wayland and gives an API for developers to

238
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,280
build towards. It's a pretty big deal. I don't want to crap on the initiative, but it sounds like,

239
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,600
hey, we have too many standards. Let's make a standard to fix. And lay it on top of all the

240
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,160
other existing things. Yeah, there is that definite potential. But the thing that seems

241
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,880
encouraging to me is this is involving people from the KDE project. This is involving the core

242
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,440
pulse audio developer, which I always mess up his name, but I came I became a patron of him.

243
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:07,040
No, no, no. No, it's now run by Arun. I can't, I can't even I don't know, I can't even take a

244
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,400
stab at his last name, but he's on Patreon. And he's now the core developer of pulse audio.

245
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,800
And they're coming in together. If it's going to work, this is the right group of people.

246
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,040
Yeah, they have the right heads in the room trying to build a coalition here,

247
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,280
lay good foundations. It'll probably be a long time just like just like Wayland was before we

248
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,000
really see it in a desktop OS or us. But yeah, it may be a long time before it's totally feature

249
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,560
rich too, right? It's going to be probably a minimum viable product for a while. And then

250
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,360
they'll build on top of it. So you and I will probably be writing out pulse audio and Jack for

251
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,560
probably another year or two. Well, we'll be early testers. I guarantee that guarantee that I still

252
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,360
am just I don't know, Jack is the vernacular is rough. It's just different. It's different.

253
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,200
But in a year or two, Microsoft will finally have a Linux distro. Come on.

254
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,240
Dar, you just never let it go. Hey, it's three years have passed. Two are missing.

255
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,360
I said five years. Come on. That's true. I know. I know. I mean,

256
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,280
we can't fault you there. It still could happen. I give you that. In the meantime,

257
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,280
I can't believe this new rig that has come into the studio shipped to us by Dell for review.

258
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:25,360
It is the Dell Precision 5530. And it is a 15 inch screen infinity edge to edge screen in a 14 inch

259
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,920
chassis. Oh, and you can get it with Xeon processors if you want. You can get it with 32 gigs of RAM.

260
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,200
I'll save the spec of ours for the review next week. But it just arrived in the studio today.

261
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,040
So I'm going to be loading it up. It has a boon to 1604 installed from the factory.

262
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,360
That looks like an XPS. It does. It looks exactly like an XPS 13,

263
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,960
only a little bit bigger. Well, because it's a 14 inch chassis and a little bit thicker.

264
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,480
But for that, you get a competent cooling system, which I'll be testing, and way more horsepower.

265
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,360
The desktop replacement version of the XPS you've always wanted.

266
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,560
Yeah. And you can get crazy fast processors in this thing.

267
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:12,800
It's got the infamous i9 as an option, I see. Can that thing really dissipate the heat?

268
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,240
Is it really capable of that?

269
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,520
I've got the... I'll give you a little spoiler. I've got the i9 version that

270
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,800
turbos up to 4.8 gigahertz, and I'm going to be testing that very thing.

271
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,160
Don't take it across the border to that crazy Canadian that drops iMacs all the time though.

272
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,640
Yeah, I know, right? I know. I'm pretty excited.

273
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,720
Which Dell are you referring to?

274
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,680
Well, hello, Mr. Wimpress. The Precision 5530, their 15 inch mobile workstation,

275
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,040
just arrived here at the studio.

276
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,720
Oh, really? Very interesting. Can you hurry up on that? Because

277
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,800
I've got Bitcoin burning a hole in my wallet, and I'm about to slam down on a new laptop,

278
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:55,280
and it's either going to be that, or the 7350, the new one, or the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Extreme.

279
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,120
Oh, man. You really are running...

280
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,440
Get the ThinkPad. I love ThinkPads.

281
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,120
So I'm seriously considering a return to ThinkPads, having been a ThinkPad user

282
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,960
for many, many years prior to the whole Dell XPS thing.

283
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,280
So yeah, I'll be really interested to hear what you have to say, Chris,

284
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,720
because literally I've got them in a spreadsheet side by side,

285
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,840
and there's only a few things that are splitting hairs between them.

286
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,040
Wow, you've even assembled a spreadsheet for this, you're telling me?

287
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,520
Oh, yeah. I need to work out exactly how many one Bitcoin

288
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm going to spend on each of these laptops.

289
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,360
Oh, that's... You know, I completely understand where you're at,

290
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,960
because you feel like you've got a limited amount of time right now with the Bitcoin, too.

291
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,520
Now's the time to pull the trigger.

292
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,640
This time last year, it could have bought all of those laptops

293
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,720
and had change out of one Bitcoin,

294
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,960
and this time this year, it's like spec those to the max for one Bitcoin.

295
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,320
Yeah. Well, I'll be trying it out starting now.

296
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,440
Even though I just got a brand new laptop, this would be like...

297
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,480
This could have been me in the future if I'd stayed into editing,

298
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,720
and I was doing video editing, or I was doing a lot of audio editing under Linux.

299
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,600
Yeah, and it's like demanding Linux workload. Perfect.

300
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
This could have been in my future, so I'll give it a review.

301
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,440
I'll load it up. I'll put it through its paces.

302
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,600
It's got a brilliant 4K display, so I'll get a good taste of that,

303
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,720
and I'll give you my full report in the next episode of Unplugged.

304
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,960
So hopefully then, Mr. Wimpy, you could make your choice.

305
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,520
I will wait for one week and one week only.

306
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,720
All right. Well, I had a great chance to chat with Nate Graham,

307
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
and if that name rings a bell,

308
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,360
it's because he's pretty involved with the Plasma project,

309
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,360
and he is the individual who's been posting weekly usability updates about Plasma

310
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,400
that really showcases all of the goodies that are coming to the Plasma desktop.

311
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,600
And it's the kind of things that have gotten me really hyped about Plasma

312
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,000
and make me want to keep using it and keep trying out the next version,

313
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,920
the next version, which actually ultimately maybe end up choosing Neon again.

314
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,440
And so I had a chance to chat with Nate about the history of his mission

315
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,320
to make Plasma more usable and also funding of that type of work.

316
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,960
I've been wanting to get Nate Graham on the show for a while,

317
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,080
and this week we had an opening and I emailed him late last night,

318
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,560
and he took me up on the chance to come on the show

319
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,520
and talk about some of the work that he's been doing with Plasma.

320
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,080
And I love this, Nate, your self-described mission to make KDE Plasma

321
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,720
the best and most widely used computer operating system interface on the planet Earth.

322
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,560
That's a great mission.

323
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,680
Nate, welcome to the show.

324
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,440
Thanks so much. It's great to be here.

325
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,720
So how are you accomplishing this mission?

326
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,840
I've noticed what really caught my attention

327
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,920
was you seem to have a big focus on polishing the usability rough edges of Plasma.

328
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,240
In fact, it seems like this is something

329
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,480
that's been kicking around in your head since 2017 at least.

330
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,680
I saw a post where you're proposing improving usability,

331
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,960
and then in September of 2017, there was a post of KDE's goals for 2018,

332
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,960
and in there was a piece from you advocating for usability improvements.

333
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,960
What's behind this mission?

334
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,240
That's right.

335
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,360
So it looks like you did a pretty good job of summarizing the history.

336
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,960
I'll just fill in a couple of details.

337
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,760
Please do.

338
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,800
So back in late 2017, the KDE leadership basically asked the community,

339
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,040
hey, what do you think we should focus on for the next couple of years?

340
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,120
And I was a relatively new member at the time.

341
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,720
I had done really hardly anything, but I thought, why not?

342
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,760
Here's what I think we need, and I'm just going to put it out there.

343
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,800
So I proposed my usability and productivity goal,

344
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,320
and to my pleasant surprise, it seemed to have resonated,

345
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,640
and people liked that, and it was chosen as a formal goal.

346
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,800
So after that, a month or two passed, and not much really happened.

347
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,480
And I realized if this was actually going to get done,

348
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,240
I had to take the initiative on it because I was the one who proposed it.

349
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,200
Nobody else was really going to do it before me,

350
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,120
and I'd never really done anything like this before.

351
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,320
But I said, you know what?

352
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,440
Let's give it a try.

353
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,560
I'm going to see what happens.

354
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,720
And I decided to just start making lists.

355
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,920
I made a list of things that I thought we needed,

356
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,960
and I decided to start kind of poking people

357
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,080
to see if I could get other people interested in it,

358
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,160
and I started submitting some patches myself.

359
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,840
And then as this went on, and things actually started to happen,

360
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,160
I thought, hey, maybe people out there in the community

361
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,840
might want to know what's going on.

362
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,080
So I decided to start a blog about it

363
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
after several other people urged me to.

364
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,480
And well, we've pretty much been going from there for about,

365
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,720
I would say, since like January of this year.

366
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,200
Right.

367
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,720
And there's no stopping me.

368
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,920
I'm going to keep going forever.

369
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,960
Good.

370
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,200
And now you're 37 additions in.

371
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,160
I know.

372
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,720
And each one wets my appetite for the next release of Plasma.

373
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,160
That's really like the net effect it's having here is this.

374
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,640
I know.

375
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,760
Isn't it amazing stuff?

376
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,240
Me too.

377
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,720
When I'm putting this together, I'm always thinking,

378
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,040
holy crap, this is amazing stuff.

379
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,800
I just cannot believe how amazing KDE contributors are.

380
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:10,400
I mean, for example, right before we started doing this interview,

381
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,720
I got an email notification about a patch

382
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,000
that somebody submitted to fix a bug that was filed yesterday.

383
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,500
Oh.

384
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,520
So that kind of thing is amazing.

385
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,080
And I feel like I'm seeing more and more of this

386
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,880
as more people get interested and excited.

387
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,560
And it's just an awesome thing to see.

388
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,080
Now, are you still pretty heavily involved

389
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,600
with the Kubuntu project as well?

390
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,960
Yes, I am.

391
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,800
Kubuntu is actually my home distro.

392
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,040
It's the one that I'm talking to you on right now.

393
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,920
And I personally feel that Kubuntu is a really great choice

394
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:46,160
for KDE made sort of accessible for the average person.

395
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,840
Rolling release distros are fantastic.

396
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,160
And rolling release distros are, in many ways,

397
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,840
the best way to get all of these usability and productivity upgrades

398
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,040
that I blog about all the time.

399
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,680
But for ordinary regular people who just kind of want to get stuff done,

400
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,440
I think nothing beats the stability of a discrete release distro.

401
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,240
And I think it's really important that Kubuntu provide that experience

402
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,120
with a really high level of polish and integration

403
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,760
so that it can kind of become the de facto KDE distro, in my opinion.

404
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,800
I think that's fantastic.

405
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,920
You know, when I think about deploying Plasma

406
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,160
at like a workplace and office environment,

407
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,440
I think here in our studio, for example,

408
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,160
all of our production machines are on Kubuntu 18.04.

409
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,600
Oh, that's wonderful.

410
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,800
That's fantastic news.

411
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,240
Rock solid, rock solid.

412
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,680
Best, really, it's the best distro I think we've ever used in production.

413
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,840
Now, on my personal machine, I got to admit, I roll KDE neon.

414
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,760
But that's just because, really, it's your fault, Nate,

415
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,560
because you get me excited.

416
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,880
That's actually totally on you.

417
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,320
Sometimes I actually tempt myself to use it.

418
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,960
There are many times when I feel like,

419
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,320
oh, man, I want to actually use some of these improvements myself,

420
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,200
particularly to the input stack,

421
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:05,200
which has gotten a lot of improvements in Plasma 5.13 and 5.14.

422
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,320
And I'm stuck on 5.12 and I'm kind of chomping at the bit to do it.

423
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,920
I kind of feel like if I don't eat my own dog food,

424
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,360
it's a pretty shameful thing.

425
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,360
So I'm going to definitely keep doing it.

426
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,880
Yeah, yeah, there's always ways,

427
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,280
like VMs and Docker containers and whatnot.

428
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,240
In fact, that's what I do.

429
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,520
I actually do all my development inside a KDE neon VM

430
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,160
with everything built from source.

431
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:33,120
And I think KDE neon is basically a near perfect development tool in that respect.

432
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,840
It gives you great isolation from your host system

433
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,600
and it lets you make all kinds of changes

434
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,520
without worrying about blowing stuff up.

435
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,040
You get everything that's KDE related pretty much rolling.

436
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,840
So I mean, it's just great.

437
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,280
I love developing in KDE neon.

438
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,080
That's fantastic.

439
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,880
I love hearing that.

440
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,680
That's so great.

441
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,120
And that means there's room for all types of KDE Plasma-powered distros

442
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,280
or metadistros, don't call it a distro.

443
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Now, I noticed too in the bio,

444
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,480
I was reading your Patreon page,

445
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,000
which I want to talk about in a moment,

446
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,200
a former Apple engineer.

447
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,240
Does that change, you think, the look you have

448
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,000
when you come in and look at the Plasma desktop?

449
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,600
Did that influence the way you view visibility as a former Apple engineer?

450
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,760
In fact, that was the core reason.

451
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
In addition to being a former Apple engineer,

452
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,880
I had been an Apple fan for pretty much my entire life starting at age six.

453
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,800
And I think that the work that I did at Apple

454
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,640
gave me a really great opportunity

455
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,240
to see how really focused development teams work

456
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,120
to produce software that's of high technical quality,

457
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,680
but also exceptionally high usability.

458
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,280
Apple has that reputation in the world.

459
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,200
And I feel like for the most part, it's justified.

460
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,920
And when I left Apple in late 2016,

461
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,960
I decided that I just wanted to start working on Linux full time.

462
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,320
And I kind of bounced around for a little bit.

463
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,520
I started with Gnome and-

464
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,560
What was that draw?

465
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,080
What was the draw to Linux there?

466
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,720
I mean, especially coming from a long history with Apple,

467
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
what drew you to Linux there, do you think?

468
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,480
Well, that's a really good question.

469
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,000
There were a number of things.

470
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,920
I started to feel like open source, just as a movement,

471
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,280
made a lot of sense for me.

472
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,880
And I started to feel like the inherent problem

473
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,400
with closed source software is that regular people

474
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,600
don't have much of an impact on it unless they're on the inside.

475
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,480
And a lot of my friends and family had gotten in the habit

476
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,720
of telling me their favorite Apple bugs

477
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,280
and file this bug for me, see if you can get this fixed.

478
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,360
And for a while I was actually doing that

479
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,640
and I felt like that was really good.

480
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,200
But after a while, I started to take a longer view

481
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,760
and it was like, well, what is this like for people

482
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,440
who don't have a person on the inside?

483
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,280
How are they going to get their pet issues resolved?

484
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,760
Because despite the fact that Apple products offer

485
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,480
exceptionally high usability, nothing's perfect, right?

486
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
And people are going to find bugs in any software.

487
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,040
And if you don't happen to have somebody on the inside,

488
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,560
you don't really have that many options

489
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,160
when it comes to closed source software.

490
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,160
And I just, the more I learned about the open source movement,

491
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,920
the more I just sort of liked the idea

492
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,040
of participatory software development

493
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,080
and an open attitude and the opportunity

494
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,600
for anybody to contribute.

495
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,560
And not only to contribute, but to go through a pipeline

496
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,760
of starting as a user and then becoming a connected user

497
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,880
who's engaging with developers and then eventually morphing

498
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,240
into a developer themselves.

499
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,760
And that was exactly my path.

500
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,840
When I started with all this stuff,

501
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,800
I mean, I'll be the first to tell you I was not a programmer

502
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,440
and I'm still not that much of a programmer today.

503
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,680
I'm a build and release engineer by trade

504
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,960
so I can do some scripting,

505
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,520
but being able to learn how to do software development

506
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,240
from the KDE community has been absolutely tremendous.

507
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,520
And I feel like if somebody as dumb as I can do it,

508
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,720
anybody can do it really.

509
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,560
Well, I mean, it seems like you have gotten your hands

510
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,600
on all kinds of different apps.

511
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,240
It looks like, I mean, just reading over some of your profile,

512
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,960
there's a lot of areas you've touched now recently.

513
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,360
And I think that's where the Patreon thing

514
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,680
is sort of a fascinating opportunity

515
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,880
for open source developers.

516
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,680
I'd like to get your thoughts on this because it seems to me,

517
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,040
so right now you've got, as we record, 81 patrons.

518
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,120
Proudly, I'm saying I'm one of them.

519
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,720
And I think it's a great idea

520
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,360
because if that were to grow,

521
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,560
you could proportionately dedicate more of your time

522
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,360
to learning what you need to learn to help more,

523
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,240
to triage more bugs, to touch more projects.

524
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,520
So what are your thoughts on using Patreon as a funding platform?

525
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,360
Even in 2018, where there seems to be some Patreon fatigue,

526
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,000
people are not as willing as they might have been

527
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,240
back in 2017 or 2016,

528
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,160
but it still seems like a great opportunity.

529
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,040
I don't have a lot of experience with the cultural side.

530
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,320
So it's news to me that people have Patreon fatigue.

531
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,920
So if that's the case, that's a little bit unfortunate.

532
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,680
But I feel like this can be a really great supplement.

533
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,160
But ultimately, that's all it really can be is as a supplement.

534
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,600
Software development is an incredibly challenging

535
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,560
and difficult field.

536
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,320
And out there in the private sector,

537
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,280
people routinely make six figures doing this.

538
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,640
And I mean, I think with some private sector experience,

539
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,280
we've all known people who bring home fat paychecks

540
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,800
without actually doing all that much.

541
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,120
And you compare and contrast that with so many people

542
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,480
in the open source community who are just being absolute rock stars

543
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,360
and getting paid nothing or very little for it.

544
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,280
So I think Patreon is fantastic.

545
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,600
And I also have several other ones set up.

546
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,440
I've got LiberoPay, I've got PayPal as well.

547
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,720
But I think the best funding model is for

548
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,640
is what essentially the Krita people are doing.

549
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,120
They have a foundation, the Krita Foundation,

550
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,560
and they aggregate donations.

551
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,280
And they actually use this to formally pay developers

552
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,960
with actual real salaries.

553
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,000
I believe the Linux Mint people have done this too.

554
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,600
And in my personal opinion,

555
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,280
this is really the only payment and funding model

556
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
that makes sustainable long-term sense,

557
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,160
which is that if you want developers,

558
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,320
you're pretty much going to need to pay developers.

559
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,760
And if you're not going to pay developers,

560
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,080
what you're going to get are interested,

561
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,400
passionate volunteers, which are fantastic,

562
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,240
but it's a hit and miss proposition.

563
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,960
And even the most interested volunteer

564
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,960
will eventually go through stages of their life

565
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,560
where they're not going to have time for it anymore

566
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,280
if they're not paid.

567
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,000
I mean, now that I've been doing this for a little while,

568
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,600
not anywhere near as long as many people in the KDE community,

569
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,400
I've noticed that people who are really passionate at first

570
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,240
often just drop out after a couple of months,

571
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,360
not because they're bored of it

572
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,480
or they don't want to do it anymore,

573
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,320
but because they got married, they started having kids,

574
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,720
they got a new job that requires them to commute

575
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,560
and they can't be in front of a computer all day,

576
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,280
that sort of thing.

577
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,640
And those are the generous scenarios.

578
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,680
There can be other reasons too.

579
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,320
That's right.

580
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,160
Exactly, many other reasons.

581
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,640
And so relying on volunteers is an inherently fragile proposition

582
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,200
and it relies on having existing members

583
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,640
being willing to constantly train and retrain new people

584
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,200
as they come in and leave and come in and leave.

585
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,600
I think if there was a dedicated core of paid developers,

586
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,000
you could see that they develop a real culture

587
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,640
of a sort of self-sustaining culture

588
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,360
where other people help out as well

589
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,200
and the knowledge becomes distributed

590
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,560
and you don't see so much churn.

591
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,160
That sort of happens right now in the KDE community

592
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,600
with Blue Systems.

593
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,360
Blue Systems sponsors a whole bunch of Plasma developers.

594
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,080
They're all paid, they work, they do it all the time.

595
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,240
And that's one of the reasons why the quality of Plasma

596
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,600
is now so high and constantly getting better.

597
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,360
And these guys aren't just working on Plasma,

598
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,440
they're working on frameworks, they're working on apps,

599
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,560
they're doing all kinds of stuff.

600
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,480
So I think that's the sort of payment paid development model

601
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,520
that we need to try to make happen everywhere else.

602
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,920
It does take some admin,

603
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
but I could completely see what you're saying,

604
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,120
how it's more sustainable and it's more like a real job

605
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,720
to the developers involved.

606
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,480
It takes a large funding initiative

607
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,040
and a foundation to admin all of that.

608
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,440
But if major projects like KDE seem like a good sized project

609
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,280
for something like that and others as well,

610
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,480
that's a fascinating idea.

611
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,240
So Patreon in a way is sort of not a stopgap,

612
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,120
but it's an intermediary solution

613
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,120
where direct consumers of the product

614
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,840
can still try to help fund the development

615
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,800
until a larger solution comes along perhaps.

616
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,240
That's exactly how I see it.

617
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
You just phrased it perfectly

618
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,480
with about a thousand times fewer words than I did.

619
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,080
Well, Nate, I really appreciate

620
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,280
all of the work you've been doing.

621
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,400
I will link to your blog if folks haven't seen that yet,

622
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,200

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,840
We'll have a link in there to Nate's usability posts.

624
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,480
Also, you can go to planet.kde.org

625
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,800
if you want to see some of the other developers posts

626
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,440
to their blogs.

627
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,600
It's a great aggregator of all of that stuff.

628
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,240
And we will have a link to Nate's Patreon,

629
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,200
which is ngram, right?

630
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,880
It's ngram, patreon.com slash ngram.

631
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,400
Yeah, if you want to just go there directly,

632
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,080
but we'll have a link in the show notes.

633
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,600
Nate, thanks so much for coming on the show

634
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,560
and stay in touch.

635
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,240
I'd love to chat again in the future.

636
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,200
Thanks so much, Chris.

637
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,080
It was fantastic.

638
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,040
I had a great time.

639
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,560
He had some really interesting ideas

640
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,520
around how to fund long-term sustainably

641
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,360
large open source projects.

642
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,560
And I thought that was a particularly new and good

643
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,240
insight on a potential solution there.

644
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,880
And it's sort of interesting timing, too,

645
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,400
because it's lining up right with a new venture that's

646
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,640
launching that I want to tell you about in just a moment.

647
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,160
But I just want to say thank you to Nate.

648
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,640
He also is stopped by the live show.

649
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,320
So he's chatting away with folks in the chat room,

650
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,120
which is awesome.

651
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,840
Just so great.

652
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,960
It's incredibly exciting to have someone like that

653
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,840
with the commercial experience he's got with Apple

654
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,360
coming into the open source community

655
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,040
and bashing on something like KDE.

656
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,040
That's fantastic.

657
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,440
Yeah.

658
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,720
And I think the posts do a lot for encouraging people

659
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,960
to check out and stay tuned into what Plasma Desktop is doing.

660
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,360
Just in a sort of, I don't know, it's not like a tease,

661
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:00,160
but it's a bit of you get, you're

662
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,880
able to appreciate all of the work that's going into it.

663
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,920
That's probably what I'm trying to say.

664
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,800
Like we were just talking with Cassidy about how so much stuff

665
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,880
is going into Juno that he's struggling to even

666
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,960
write up to outline it all.

667
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,960
But this way, this weekly approach that Nate's taken

668
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,120
gives you the space to sort of enjoy

669
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,880
some of the finer, smaller little things,

670
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,840
like new icons and when you right click in the menu

671
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,920
and things that are nice to know about

672
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,560
but would otherwise get lost in a much larger noise

673
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,600
around a new release.

674
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,240
And so it helps build appreciation for all of the work

675
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,560
that these people are contributing to a project.

676
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,840
And it creates hype.

677
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,160
And I think it's in part responsible for,

678
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,480
as Wimpy puts it, the ascendancy we're seeing

679
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,160
of the Plasma Desktop right now.

680
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,880
And it's got people like us going on a podcast

681
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,920
and talking about it, which amplifies the hype a bit.

682
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,760
And we're using it in production.

683
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,720
We're using it in real life.

684
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,560
Yeah, it seems like it's a good position, right?

685
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,680
They've got a great community going.

686
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,720
They've got active users and their software these days

687
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,440
is just great.

688
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,320
I keep getting a steady stream of one or two,

689
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,600
at least a week.

690
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,800
And this is months after we did our Plasma episode

691
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,080
of people saying, all right, I'm trying it.

692
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,840
I'm taking the Plasma challenge and I'm really liking it.

693
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,120
I'm still getting that.

694
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,320
I'm still using it over here.

695
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,840
I've been using it for about three months every day.

696
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,520
I have my first lockup today.

697
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,080
But other than that, it's been fantastic.

698
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,200
Really, really fantastic.

699
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,320
It could have made it one more day

700
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,680
and then that wouldn't have gone on out there.

701
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,720
Yeah, that's how it always works.

702
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,000
Well, it's better than no.

703
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,440
Yeah, well, I suppose so.

704
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,120
It does last a little bit longer.

705
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,760
So the conversation there at the end was kind of about funding

706
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,600
and what's a sustainable approach for somebody

707
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,080
who's making a nice contribution,

708
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,080
doesn't even need to be their primary revenue source.

709
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,800
Of course, that'd be great.

710
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,800
But just as like a secondary to really justify the time investment.

711
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,400
Well, a new startup called Tidelift hopes to help

712
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,360
these developers achieve just that

713
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,680
and get paid with a business model the company compares to Netflix.

714
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,360
So Tidelift is a startup right now.

715
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,960
It just got 30 million in funding, at least I think.

716
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,960
And the idea is that a company pays a subscription to Tidelift,

717
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,320
which then takes a cut

718
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,800
and then distributes the remainder to open source projects

719
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:18,160
and the subscribers will in exchange get assurances

720
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,200
that the software will be properly maintained, quote unquote.

721
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,040
So customers pay Tidelift and then their pitch here

722
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,000
is developers can focus on code instead of sales and marketing,

723
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,760
getting their income from Tidelift.

724
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,200
And then when a customer signs up for Tidelift,

725
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,720
they go analyze your code base,

726
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,280
go see all the neat open source projects you're using

727
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,320
and then bill you based on funding each of those projects.

728
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,880
Right.

729
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,520
Do they contribute any of that work back upstream

730
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,160
or is it, you know, you pay for it, you get to keep all that work?

731
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,240
No, the idea is you're paying an open source developer's time.

732
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,800
So they look at how many open source projects

733
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,440
your company is dependent on, Tidelift then says,

734
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,280
all right, your fee is X because of the amount of projects that you use.

735
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,760
You cut that check to Tidelift.

736
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,800
They then go engage with the open source developer and say,

737
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,560
we can pay you X a month if you will then commit

738
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,600
to maintaining the software for X period of time

739
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,680
and to also keep Tidelift and our customers informed of major changes.

740
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,520
And then Tidelift goes back to the subscriber, the customer and says,

741
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,680
all right, here's the pledge by the open source developer

742
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,400
to maintain these super important projects that you depend on.

743
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,840
That's kind of the idea, right?

744
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,080
Have they got any track history in how much they're paying developers

745
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,880
for their commitment to these projects?

746
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,720
Yeah, that has been the very thing that Wired tried to get from them

747
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,640
and they didn't really have much to offer there.

748
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,520
They've made a couple of blog posts about developers

749
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,200
that they've got brought in on the team,

750
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,720
but they haven't really been clear on the amount of money the developers get.

751
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,320
They say, so, okay, here's the numbers, they got 15 million in venture capital.

752
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,520
Sorry, it's not 30.

753
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,560
And they announced last week that they set aside a million of that 15 million

754
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,640
for new developers that join the program

755
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,000
and the developers will be paid at least $10,000 over a two-year period at least.

756
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,480
That's all they've said publicly in terms of funding.

757
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,160
$5,000 a year.

758
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,720
Yeah.

759
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,200
I'm spying.

760
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,640
Between hundreds of people.

761
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,920
It's not even a cup of tea.

762
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,760
Here's the other big problem with this.

763
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
That's just called a consultancy company.

764
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,680
And of course, I can see why investors would put money into it.

765
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,320
If they acquired the developer base,

766
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,760
of course, they will be a powerful consulting company

767
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,000
because there is a brain shortage of skilled developers.

768
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,320
So eventually they would be able.

769
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,760
And what are the conditions for the developers to be tied into them?

770
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,800
Because otherwise I don't see them making money long-term anyways.

771
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,680
It seems to me this is a middleman in a business negotiation

772
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:48,720
with open source developers that doesn't need to be there.

773
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,480
And companies are serious about engaging with a project that they're dependent on.

774
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,720
Just go and contact.

775
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:04,240
It's very easy to find the key people behind a project or a foundation or whatever.

776
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,800
Just find those people, approach them directly,

777
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,920
and that's probably the best way to invest your money

778
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,240
behind a technology that you're dependent upon.

779
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,120
And more foundations on the open source side would help, I think.

780
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,120
I think the other thing to consider here is the pitch.

781
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,280
This is what raises a red flag for me.

782
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,680
Netflix for open source, that just makes my skin crawl.

783
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,640
What does that even mean?

784
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,560
Well, that's a pitch for investors.

785
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,320
That's not for the developer side of things.

786
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,120
Come on.

787
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,120
I wonder how Netflix feel about their brand being associated with this as well.

788
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,600
We shall see.

789
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,880
I thought that was interesting though.

790
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,080
It's another crack at this.

791
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,520
And I don't know, I think Nate's idea is a better one.

792
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,040
And then Wimpy's right.

793
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,600
Then companies could just interface with that foundation

794
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,920
and there would be an established process for that.

795
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,000
It does seem like the better solution.

796
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:53,840
So let's talk about something new that's getting some attention.

797
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,720
A Linux distro that's optimized for the Windows subsystem for Linux.

798
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,400
It's based on Debian and the core developer Hayden is joining us today.

799
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,000
Hayden, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

800
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,200
Hi, thanks for having me.

801
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:07,840
Hello, Hayden.

802
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,800
It's good to have you here.

803
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,040
So you had a chance to chat with Joe Resington, my co-host and Wes's co-host,

804
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,040
who's been filming for me on Linux Action News,

805
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,680
to answer a few questions so that way Joe could accurately cover the story in LAN.

806
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,760
And he recorded that chat so we could refer to it for notes.

807
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,160
And I thought it was so great that I would just play it here.

808
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:32,080
It's a bit rough, but it was a great deep dive into why WLinux has been created

809
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,120
and why the Windows subsystem for Linux

810
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,000
might need a distro that's built specifically for it.

811
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,360
Thanks for joining me, Hayden.

812
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,320
Thanks for having me, Joe.

813
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,040
So you're here to talk about WLinux.

814
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,800
What exactly is that then?

815
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,240
WLinux is a Debian derivative that is designed to function on Windows subsystem for Linux.

816
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,120
It is a distro that is customized for that environment.

817
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,040
And so this is based on Debian then?

818
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:04,080
Yes, this is a derivative of Debian Stretch with a handful of packages

819
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:10,640
from the Debian testing branch that have been brought down, mostly Python and other dev tools

820
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,880
that have a more updated version in the testing branch that are fairly stable.

821
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,160
And so what makes this different from the version of Debian

822
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,960
that's already available in the subsystem?

823
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,840
So a free distro Debian is already available.

824
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:30,560
And if you're first getting into WSL, which is short for Windows subsystem for Linux,

825
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,680
you might want to give it a shot.

826
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:37,600
But WLinux has a lot of customizations and additional packages that make working

827
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,080
in this kind of hybrid environment a little bit easier

828
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,440
between Windows and between Linux at the same time.

829
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,160
So one of the big differences is no system D then.

830
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,360
Why is that?

831
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:55,040
Well, part of that is because system D doesn't work well on Windows subsystem for Linux.

832
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,440
So it was kind of a no brainer to pull out.

833
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:09,040
I'm a big fan of the dev win project and appreciate in it freedom from Unix philosophy standpoint.

834
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,560
But mostly it was just taking up space on WLinux.

835
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,680
So we took it out.

836
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,640
SysV is there.

837
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:23,280
If you install some programs that have a hard system D dependency,

838
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,000
the lib system D will come in.

839
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,320
But it was mostly just a matter of size.

840
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:28,800
Okay.

841
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,200
But why didn't you just go with dev one then?

842
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,000
Because it isn't that just Debian with no system D.

843
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,760
I did do testing with dev one.

844
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:47,280
It added some more complexity to the build process with no apparent improvement to the user.

845
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,720
And kind of being a Unix-y guy believing in Unix principles,

846
00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:00,400
I didn't see needlessly interjecting complexity for something that we can actually just do

847
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,640
on the Debian from the Debian sources ourselves.

848
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:15,760
Also, we do know that people might want to bring in packages from upstream GNOME and KDE

849
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,840
to run those apps on Windows.

850
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:24,960
And if we had a hard block on system D, they wouldn't be able to run the most recent version of those.

851
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,480
Okay, that makes sense.

852
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,280
So talking of GUI stuff, I mean, the subsystem is not supposed to be for GUI applications,

853
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,880
but you've made it easy to run Google Chrome and Visual Studio and other GUI stuff.

854
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,080
What's all that about?

855
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:43,280
So this isn't an officially supported feature of WSL, but it is available.

856
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,400
And there's a few tweaks we do to make that work with an external X client.

857
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,280
There's a few, there's a couple of free ones available.

858
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,280
My favorite is X410.

859
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,840
It's available in the Microsoft Store for $5.

860
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:04,640
And we just made some tweaks so that the, for example, the libGL is rendered on the Windows side,

861
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,800
where you can get some more acceleration out of those apps.

862
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,480
And it's very functional.

863
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:20,560
In fact, there are people, although I don't recommend it, who do boot WSL into a full-fledged Xfce, KDE, or GNOME desktop.

864
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,440
You know, sometimes in a separate window, like you would a virtual machine,

865
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,560
and sometimes right next to their Windows apps on the same screen.

866
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,560
People are doing interesting things with this.

867
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,560
I heard about Flatpaks.

868
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:39,680
Up and running on WSL this week, presumably they work reasonably well.

869
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,440
And what about Snaps as well?

870
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,280
So far, Snaps, you know, are a little bit of a challenge.

871
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,360
Flatpaks are working better, so we'll see where that goes.

872
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,640
Snap has some dependencies that we have to work through to see if we can't make those work.

873
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,440
I thought the chat that Joe and Hayden had was fantastic.

874
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,960
In fact, it was a really good one.

875
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,760
It went on for quite a bit, but I wanted to take a moment and bring Hayden in live, since he's here,

876
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,800
and chat about WLinux a bit with him.

877
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,760
And I wanted to maybe double down before we've gone too far on some of the issues with SystemD

878
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,760
under the Windows subsystem for Linux.

879
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,160
I have never really spent much time with the Windows subsystem for Linux, Hayden,

880
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:27,040
but looking at bug reports, it seems that the WSL has its own process that it wants to run at PID 1.

881
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,040
Is that one of those things that you want to do?

882
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,360
That it wants to run at PID 1, is that one of the issues with SystemD on WSL?

883
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:40,000
The issue with SystemD on WSL is that it's not meant at this point to run servers.

884
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,360
It's not meant to run ongoing processes that you access from the background.

885
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:53,600
That may change in the future as Microsoft just announced Windows Server 2019 with WSL as a feature.

886
00:52:53,600 --> 00:53:03,200
So that may change, and we may see more growth on that use of WSL to run Linux processes.

887
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,200
We'll see where it goes.

888
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:12,000
I found it really interesting, some of the work you've put into running the graphical applications like Chrome.

889
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,200
I recently saw, I can't remember where, you were talking about fixing an issue with Chromium

890
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,800
from running it from WLinux, which I think is great, because that's been an area

891
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,640
I've been really curious, like if I was ever to play around with WSL, I would love to do that.

892
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:32,480
In regards to the SNAP issue you ran into, I invite you to chat with Mr. Martin Wimpress here

893
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,600
in our virtual log, he could probably help with any issues there, because he's working on that canonical.

894
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:42,080
I guess probably SNAP must be dependent on something that's not in WLinux now?

895
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:48,480
Yeah, well the main thing is the dependency on SystemD support, but we do have a shim that can work around that,

896
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:55,200
which is how we delivered SNAP support in 14.04, which was built upon Upstart.

897
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:03,440
So Hayden, I'm Martin Wimpress, I work on the SNAPcraft team.

898
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,600
Find me on Twitter at m underscore Wimpress and I'll be happy to help.

899
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,800
Absolutely, I will do that because I want to work with you on that, Flatpaks as well.

900
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,840
Yeah, we're testing an issue right now with Google Chrome, the latest version 69.

901
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,440
We're working through some libgl acceleration issues.

902
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,680
We have an open issue on the GitHub and we're troubleshooting that.

903
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:34,400
As far as we know, it affects most of the WSL distros available,

904
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,640
but we're the ones actually doing the investigation,

905
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,800
pulling logs, seeing how we can fix this for WSL users.

906
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:49,440
Yeah, it seems like that could be an interesting impact that your distribution could have,

907
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,040
is by really focusing in on this like no other distribution is,

908
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:58,640
you're going to push up against these edge cases that could drive future improvements to the subsystem.

909
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,840
So I think that's great, and I wonder if it's also going to be revenue sustainable potentially,

910
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:11,200
because I noticed you're selling it for $19.99, it's on sale right now for $9.99,

911
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,160
and that's in the Microsoft Store, which is of course the way you get it into the subsystem for Linux.

912
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,240
Do you think this might be at some point revenue sustainable?

913
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,560
So that's our long-term goal, and we've talked a lot about different sustainability models

914
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,760
for open source projects in this episode,

915
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,760
and I think what we need to realize is that people have been paying for Linux

916
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,400
on a commercial and enterprise level for a long time,

917
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:40,080
and that's been sponsoring a lot of the innovations we all enjoy in community distros.

918
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:47,920
So what I see is a democratization of that process with Krita, with elementary OS,

919
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,160
with other projects, not so much the one you mentioned in the interim,

920
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:59,920
but where the users, the open source users themselves are being entrepreneurial,

921
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,000
taking ownership of these, pushing them along, and commercializing them

922
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,520
so that you can push these developments out to other people.

923
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,080
Another good example of this is CodeWeavers, who's worked on crossover

924
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,320
and have worked with Valve on Proton.

925
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:25,200
So there's always an angle sometimes to commercialize these, and we give back.

926
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,720
One of the examples is we already identified a package that's just not available anywhere

927
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,960
as an app, in an app repo, and we're hosting it.

928
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:43,040
So you're welcome to use our app repo in any existing Debian or Ubuntu distro

929
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,360
to install that package.

930
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:49,760
I noticed also that you mentioned one of the features is faster patching

931
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,320
than other upstream distributions for subsystem-specific bugs,

932
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,320
and that you're specifically monitoring subsystem-related CVEs.

933
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,200
Is that delivered through that repo as well, those fixes?

934
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
So the fixes aren't delivered through the repo.

935
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:09,600
The repo is currently simply delivering packages and package updates to our custom packages.

936
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:17,520
We are in the process of rolling out a new onboarding experience for users.

937
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,400
We had so many requests for packages, it simply was not possible

938
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,920
to ship everyone's editor and everyone's tools in one.

939
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,840
So we're going to create a front-end where you can go through

940
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,840
when you launch WLinux the first time and specify,

941
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,400
I'm a Python developer, install all my Python.

942
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:46,560
I want to use NeoVim or code, and we will take care of that for you.

943
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,560
And then we're going to build auto-updating into that going forward

944
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:55,360
so that everyone, regardless of whether you're building it off the GitHub

945
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,200
or downloading it from the store,

946
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:03,360
will always have the latest availability to the features, so there won't be a gap there.

947
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,840
So one example of this was a problem in a relatively...

948
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:13,280
So WSL doesn't implement IP tables yet, or very well at all.

949
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,840
And there was a package in Ubuntu that broke called EBTables.

950
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,560
And it's an obscure package, and it did something in the install script

951
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:31,520
that broke apt and basically prevented everyone on Ubuntu 18.04

952
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,320
on WSL from updating for a few weeks.

953
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:40,160
Well, we worked, and I give credit to Ubuntu for helping us get that fixed,

954
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:45,200
but it took a few weeks, and we could have pushed that out in a day or two.

955
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,280
Yeah, and again, I think that's going to be one of the great side contributions

956
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,440
or direct contributions, really, of the project existing, is pushing on those edges.

957
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,160
Well, Hayden, thank you for taking the time to chat with me

958
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,720
and for chatting with Joe to get the coverage right on Linux Action News.

959
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,400
I'll put links to a bunch of information about the project

960
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,200
as well as the Microsoft Store link, because like I mentioned,

961
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,920
it is on sale for 50% off right now if you want to play around with it.

962
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,560
I know we have Windows users out there in that audience, Wes.

963
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,760
Yeah, you're stuck. Maybe you don't want to run a VM, you don't need a VM.

964
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,240
Hey, now you've got a custom-tailored distribution.

965
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,320
Yeah, so good work, Hayden. I hope it keeps up.

966
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,320
I know some people have been a little like, what is this?

967
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,920
But I say good on you,

968
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,720
and I'm curious to see where the project goes in the future.

969
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,440
Any hints where we're going after this? What's next?

970
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,440
So we're looking right now after we get the onboarding experience done,

971
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,960
we're looking at internationalization.

972
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,080
WLinux is unexpectedly popular in China and Japan.

973
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,920
You know, it took me completely by surprise,

974
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,200
so we're adding in foreign language support as quickly as possible.

975
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,440
And then we're going to be adding Arm64 support to support Windows on ARM devices.

976
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,960
I love it. That's interesting.

977
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,760
Well, do keep us informed on how it goes. Keep us up to date.

978
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,360
I'd love to follow the progress of things,

979
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,320
and you're welcome back any time to update us on any major developments.

980
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,760
Thank you so much. I do appreciate it.

981
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,920
You bet. Well, let's do something that we should do a lot more of,

982
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,640
to be honest with you, and that's read folks' emails and follow-ups

983
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,920
and all those kinds of things.

984
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,080
How about I take this first one here, Wes?

985
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,880
Because John writes in to address you.

986
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,840
So I'll read this one here.

987
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,480
He says, I took note of Wes mentioning

988
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,920
a possible root on ZFS setup for his new ThinkPad.

989
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,800
I would definitely recommend giving this a shot.

990
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,720
I don't know what distro you plan on using,

991
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,720
but in the past few years, I've been using nothing but root on ZFS

992
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,720
on Arch with binary updates.

993
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,080
And he points you out to, there's an Arch ZFS GitHub page.

994
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,560
But he says, I also wasn't quite happy

995
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,640
with the way Linux supported boot environments,

996
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,920
which is a nice feature when you use ZFS.

997
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,960
It really is, yeah.

998
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,400
And you could really dig this, I think.

999
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,920
So he wrote his own.

1000
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,560
He calls it ZD environment and or Zed environment.

1001
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,280
Zed environment.

1002
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,040
And he links to it in the email.

1003
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,920
And he says, it removes the worry of kernel updates

1004
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,080
or system changes causing issues

1005
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,080
since you can create a new boot environment

1006
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,080
and you make your changes there.

1007
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,120
If you happen to give root on ZFS a shot

1008
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,800
and you're looking for a boot environment client,

1009
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,440
please take a look at it and best of luck with your new computer.

1010
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,760
John, that is awesome.

1011
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,440
I'm also really just thinking,

1012
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,120
I'm going to double down on this root on ZFS.

1013
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,720
Maybe also encrypted.

1014
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,360
So we'll have more to talk about in that arena soon.

1015
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,560
That could be fun.

1016
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,960
So Omkar writes in and he says he loves the show.

1017
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,280
In fact, he also seems to be a TechSnap fan

1018
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,360
because he says, I find Wes knowledgeable

1019
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,440
and the way he explains stuff on TechSnap

1020
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,880
and Linux Unplugged is fascinating.

1021
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:33,600
Well, thanks.

1022
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,160
That's really nice.

1023
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:34,800
Much appreciated.

1024
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,560
He says he's got a few questions for us.

1025
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,640
What kind of hardware setup have you configured

1026
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:43,920
for Proxmox VE and which version of Proxmox?

1027
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,040
Oh, man.

1028
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,320
That's a you question, Chris.

1029
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,120
It's a three-year-old install

1030
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,720
or maybe even four years old now.

1031
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,640
So that would be, well, I couldn't tell you

1032
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,080
what version that is.

1033
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,000
That's a pretty old install.

1034
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,440
Maybe I could bring in our IT guy.

1035
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,720
Maybe he could tell me.

1036
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,200
Hey, Brown Bear, could you come in here for a second?

1037
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,400
I got a question for you.

1038
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:03,680
Hello.

1039
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,920
Hey, Brown Bear, do you remember what version of Proxmox

1040
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:08,320
we're running on that i7 rig in the garage?

1041
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,160
Well, I've got good and bad news for you.

1042
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,520
Which would you like first?

1043
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:14,080
Well, okay, let's start with the bad news

1044
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,440
because I think I know where you're going.

1045
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,280
Bad news is you're no longer running Proxmox

1046
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,560
on the i7 in the garage.

1047
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,080
Yeah, I know.

1048
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,400
It's running now CentOS, isn't it?

1049
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,040
It is, yeah.

1050
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,120
Alan and I set up CentOS and then we put,

1051
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,800
actually, we installed libvirtd and set it up

1052
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,880
just like Red Hat would as a, you know,

1053
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,480
it's kind of like a KVM hypervisor kind of a deal.

1054
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,920
And that's actually been working really good.

1055
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,360
I can tell you the truth.

1056
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,400
It's been really solid.

1057
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,080
Proxmox was great, though.

1058
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,080
But times have really changed.

1059
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:42,960
The options have changed.

1060
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,520
I don't know if you've ever been a Proxmox user or no,

1061
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,480
but I know that you're big on the CentOS virtualization stuff.

1062
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:48,960
Yeah, I have.

1063
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,280
In fact, I've gotten crap on the Ask Noah show

1064
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,680
for not giving enough good juju to Proxmox

1065
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,920
because it really is a fantastic project.

1066
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,280
They really do some really great work.

1067
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,680
And if you want an enterprise grade virtualization system

1068
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,200
that has a really fantastic UI,

1069
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,880
man, Proxmox is really the way to go.

1070
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,040
It's just when you start looking into things

1071
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:11,200
like I want the ability to have a BSD server that's on here.

1072
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,040
And then when I go back to Grand Forks,

1073
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,800
I want that BSD server to fall over

1074
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,880
to my virtualized host in Grand Forks.

1075
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,960
And if I come back here, I want it to go back over here.

1076
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,240
And those kinds of things.

1077
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,680
It's really nice to have something a little bit meatier.

1078
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,960
That does sound really cool.

1079
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,520
OK, so Omkar's next question was,

1080
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,760
what droplet specs do you guys recommend

1081
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,640
for a GitLab and a PeerTube instance?

1082
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,840
Well, those are two tough questions.

1083
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:37,280
So GitLab, you'd probably be OK with the $20 a month

1084
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,000
or less droplets.

1085
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,800
GitLab's not going to be.

1086
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,600
It just depends on how busy you are.

1087
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,960
It depends on what you do with that, I guess.

1088
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,240
There's a lot of extended features.

1089
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,400
But if you're just dumping some commits to it,

1090
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,680
it's probably doable.

1091
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,600
Now PeerTube, here's what's tricky about PeerTube is,

1092
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,760
if you think about it, you're kind of re-implementing

1093
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:52,880
what YouTube does.

1094
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:55,120
And there is a transcoding process

1095
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:58,160
that PeerTube goes through when you upload a video.

1096
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,600
And the speed of your droplet is going to directly impact

1097
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:03,200
how long it takes for those videos

1098
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,480
to be available on PeerTube.

1099
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,560
If you don't care, if you just want someplace

1100
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,840
to throw up videos and you don't care

1101
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:10,160
if it takes an hour for the video to be available,

1102
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,800
then you really could get away with a $5 a month droplet

1103
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:16,320
because you're not using much CPU because the decoding's

1104
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,080
happening on client side for the video.

1105
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,400
And the bandwidth is still fast regardless

1106
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,760
of which machine you get.

1107
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,320
And then he asked a question that I'm going to punt to you,

1108
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:24,560
Wes.

1109
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,040
He asked if either of us have ever tried out traffic,

1110
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,640
which I think is how you pronounce it.

1111
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,800
It's spelled T-R-A-E-F-I-K.

1112
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,520
And for those of you that don't know, I didn't.

1113
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,000
It is what they call Cloud Native Edge Router.

1114
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,760
It's a reverse proxy in a load balancer

1115
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,680
that's easy, dynamic, automatic, and open source.

1116
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:43,200
So it seems like it's pretty cool.

1117
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,440
Have you ever heard of Trafic or Traffic, Wes?

1118
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:45,680
Yeah.

1119
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:48,800
So you can front, basically, if you're running a bunch of stuff

1120
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,120
on your fancy Kubernetes clusters,

1121
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,400
you can put this in front of it.

1122
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,440
And it will auto discover.

1123
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,640
It'll talk to Kubernetes or Swarm or some other technologies.

1124
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,440
Oh, cool.

1125
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,440
Find what services you're running,

1126
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,760
connect to them, and integrate with metrics.

1127
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,520
It can do HTTPS at the front.

1128
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,760
Also ties in with some of those open tracing systems.

1129
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,880
You can get logs and sort of analyze how a request flows

1130
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,160
through all of your services.

1131
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,640
Yeah, it's a nice looking web UI to manage this.

1132
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,160
This is, I see.

1133
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:14,480
I see.

1134
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,520
So it ties in, basically, with the different orchestration APIs

1135
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:20,320
and then automatically configures the reverse proxy,

1136
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,560
attaches statistics using open source projects,

1137
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,440
and you're good to go.

1138
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:23,600
Yeah.

1139
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,040
So there's a lot to like there.

1140
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,360
But if you're not using some sort of orchestration software,

1141
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,120
it's probably not necessarily what you use.

1142
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,440
Maybe something just like, well, Envoy might work,

1143
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,040
or just NGINX even.

1144
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,560
There's a lot of solutions that won't

1145
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,680
have all those fancy features.

1146
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,440
But if you don't need them, if you just

1147
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,680
have two apps that are running on two different droplets,

1148
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,960
well, you're probably fine.

1149
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,280
Yeah.

1150
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:43,520
Yeah.

1151
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,080
So there you go.

1152
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,200
Thanks for the emails.

1153
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,000
We got a bunch of others, some of them which were eight

1154
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,760
or nine paragraphs long, read them all,

1155
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,040
but can't cover them all on the show.

1156
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,160
They've got to be a certain length.

1157
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,320
And we would love to get your feedback, your questions,

1158
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:58,000
your suggestions for the show, linuxunplug.com contact.

1159
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,240
And links for anything we talked about today, linuxunplug268.

1160
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,280
So Mr. Noah Chalaya, what are you doing

1161
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,560
in this part of the woods?

1162
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,320
Are you just coming out here to hang out for the barbecue?

1163
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:10,240
Dude, I am always here for just the food.

1164
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,040
I mean, I say nice things like I came here

1165
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,720
for your stunning personality and I wanted to hang out

1166
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,120
and stuff, but really, it's the barbecue.

1167
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,920
How many minutes was it that you walked into the door?

1168
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:21,680
I think it couldn't have been more than five minutes.

1169
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,760
We were already packing up to go to lunch when you got here.

1170
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,920
Yeah, you know, I really had a suspect.

1171
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,600
I mean, here's the thing.

1172
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:28,560
We can talk about food.

1173
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,000
I'm not saying that we can't.

1174
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,480
But I feel like you had an agenda before I ever came here.

1175
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,840
Before I ever set foot in the door,

1176
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:39,280
I just felt like it was your premise to take me

1177
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,440
to Indian food and that decision process had been made

1178
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,040
before I ever entered the premises.

1179
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,000
Yeah, you're welcome.

1180
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,960
Is that your way of saying thank you?

1181
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,680
That's a long-winded way of saying thank you.

1182
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,480
So what are you doing over there?

1183
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,840
Getting ready for the Ask Noah program?

1184
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,800
I am, yeah.

1185
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,040
I'm sure you guys have heard, Google has been making

1186
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,200
some weird decisions, forcing people to log in,

1187
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,720
and we're going to ask the audience

1188
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,600
if they think this enhances their experience using Chrome

1189
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,840
or if this time Google has gone too far,

1190
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,240
if they've taken privacy and thrown it out the windows,

1191
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,360
Google tends to do.

1192
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,280
We got a number of other exciting stories

1193
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,240
that we're going to get to.

1194
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,440
Project Triton has adopted a code of conduct.

1195
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:14,400
We're going to talk about that.

1196
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,480
A little bit of follow-up to last week's episode.

1197
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,440
Chrome OS 71 has launched.

1198
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,080
Now Linux apps are available on non-Pixel devices.

1199
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,720
Also the ability to share files with Linux.

1200
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,400
Yeah, it's absolutely fantastic.

1201
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,160
So we're going to talk about all those things.

1202
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,240
And then towards the end of the show, if we have time,

1203
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,080
because this is like the least important thing in the world,

1204
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,400
but Microsoft has launched the ability

1205
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,440
to have multi-user virtualization on Windows.

1206
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,680
We're going to explain how that can be leveraged

1207
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,480
in an all Linux environment.

1208
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,680
If you're just virtualizing Windows,

1209
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,680
if you want to be Linux on the hardware,

1210
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:48,080
Windows in a virtual environment,

1211
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,480
how this is actually going to benefit your Linux environment.

1212
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,400
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

1213
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,200
That's right, Leo.

1214
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,920
Well, I look forward to it.

1215
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,280
Yeah, I just was making this joke earlier in the show.

1216
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,600
I look at the stats and I'd say there's 30%.

1217
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:05,200
Well, yeah, it might be around 30%-ish.

1218
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,640
Somewhere in that ballpark of the people

1219
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,400
that download the show are on Windows.

1220
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,240
It's somewhere in that area.

1221
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,280
And we love you too.

1222
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,560
Yeah, so we appreciate it.

1223
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,640
Maybe they're just checking us out

1224
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,680
before they make the big switch.

1225
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,080
They're looking for all the guides and the know-how.

1226
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,280
Yeah, I look at myself as Jesus Christ.

1227
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:26,000
Jesus, you know, he wouldn't go into the places

1228
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
where everybody had become a follower

1229
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,240
because there's not a lot to be done there.

1230
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:34,720
So I need to be in the homes of the sinners

1231
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,560
so that I can bring them to the wonderful world.

1232
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,720
This is really just falling apart as you keep going.

1233
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,240
My Lord and Savior, Linux Torvalds.

1234
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:43,440
This really explains a few things, actually.

1235
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,200
This worldview now explains a few things.

1236
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,320
I understand you a little better now.

1237
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,400
There are memes going on.

1238
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,320
Apparently, I said one time on an episode,

1239
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,040
I said that Linux was a religion I was just going to give in.

1240
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,560
And so I just started calling myself the Pope.

1241
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,360
And now it's become memes.

1242
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,240
Well, yeah, Pope might not be too far off the mark.

1243
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,440
I've been meme-ified.

1244
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,920
Well, now that I'm sure we've enraged somebody,

1245
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,680
we should probably wrap this thing up.

1246
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:09,280
Go get more of Martin Wimpress over at the Ubuntu podcast.

1247
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,600
Go get more of them. Great show.

1248
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,760
Not just me, but also Mark.

1249
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:18,960
Everyone remember, Mark is not Martin or Alan or Popey or Wimpy.

1250
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,520
He's Mark.

1251
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:23,360
Mark is one third of the Ubuntu podcast.

1252
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,000
Yeah.

1253
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,440
Yeah, he visits on occasion.

1254
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:29,200
So that's why he doesn't get probably the mention as often

1255
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,640
because you're right here front and center.

1256
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,240
But it is a great trio at that.

1257
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,880
And also, go check out Cassidy James's work.

1258
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,120
The Medium post that we chatted about earlier

1259
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,280
will be linked in the show notes.

1260
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,240
And stick around.

1261
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,360
We got the post-show coming up.

1262
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:45,520
And then right after that on the live stream

1263
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,040
is the Ask Nowhere program,

1264
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,800
which will be live, taking your calls.

1265
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,640
We might talk about some of the same topics,

1266
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,720
but you actually get to chime in via the phone.

1267
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,720
You don't even have to bother installing Mumble.

1268
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,040
Wes Payne's available all the time online.

1269
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:57,840
You can just hunt him down.

1270
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,960
He's at Wes Payne.

1271
01:09:58,960 --> 01:09:59,520
That's right.

1272
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,360
And then he's on the TechSnap program.

1273
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,160
New show, just launched.

1274
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,200
Actually, I kid.

1275
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,320
It's not a new show.

1276
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,040
It's been around for a while.

1277
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,320
But it's coming out, dude, all the time.

1278
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:06,880
It's pretty great.

1279
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,000
And we just had John the Nice Guy on the show last week.

1280
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:10,720
You should go check it out.

1281
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,400
He's got some hot tips.

1282
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:12,960
Yeah.

1283
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,400
Especially if you want to dive a little deeper

1284
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,320
into interplanetary file system,

1285
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,000
all of that is over at TechSnap.systems.

1286
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:18,560
All right.

1287
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:18,960
That's all.

1288
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:19,440
Hey.

1289
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:19,760
Yeah.

1290
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:20,000
What?

1291
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:20,720
What?

1292
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:22,800
You had John Spriggs on.

1293
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,040
Yeah.

1294
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:24,400
Yeah.

1295
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:25,760
It's nice, right?

1296
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,400
Wow.

1297
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,680
I've been away too long.

1298
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:31,920
John is not just John the Nice Guy Spriggs.

1299
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,080
John is a super nice guy.

1300
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:34,400
He is.

1301
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:35,200
He really is.

1302
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:35,520
Yeah.

1303
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:35,680
Yeah.

1304
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,280
He's the organizer of OpCamp.

1305
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:37,840
I know.

1306
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:38,080
I know.

1307
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,240
I've been wanting to have him on the show forever.

1308
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:41,040
So go check it out.

1309
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,640
TechSnap.systems.

1310
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,080
All our links, LinuxUnplugged.com.

1311
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,040
I'm Matt Chris, L-E-S.

1312
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:45,760
Thanks for joining us.

1313
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:50,320
See you next Tuesday.

1314
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:23,200
I wanted to pick Wimpy's brain.

1315
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,320
I don't know exactly what the right way to ask this question is, Wimpy,

1316
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:30,240
but is there a way to tell what the difference would be

1317
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:39,040
in terms of patches or additions to Ubuntu's 1810 gnome versus, say, stock gnome?

1318
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:45,440
So is there a way to actually detail patch sets that might be better for performance?

1319
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,880
I'm trying to think about how to review the new distro releases,

1320
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,040
and performance of the gnome desktop is something I think I kind of want to take a look at,

1321
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:57,760
but I'm not quite sure how to tell differences in terms of patch sets that have been applied

1322
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,800
for performance.

1323
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,360
Yes.

1324
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:07,840
So if you want to see what patches are being applied to what is the upstream version of

1325
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:14,160
gnome shell and the patches that are being carried in Ubuntu, what will become 1810,

1326
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:19,520
then yes, you can see all of that in Launchpad because all of that Debian packaging that

1327
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:24,880
happens happens in Launchpad, and you can see those patches directly.

1328
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:32,320
What I would say is that I know that Daniel Van Voet, who's part of the Ubuntu desktop

1329
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:39,360
team, all of the patches that we're carrying as vendor patches right now have been submitted

1330
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:49,600
upstream and are in various stages of review and will eventually percolate into the upstream

1331
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,640
gnome project.

1332
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,560
But whilst they're being negotiated, we're carrying the patches that he's been working

1333
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:10,160
on.
