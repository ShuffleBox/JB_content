1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Do you guys see this ruggedized NUC?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,740
How crazy is this thing?

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:06,740
You ready for this?

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,380
It's a NUC with Broadwell and Baytrail.

5
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,160
You can go with a couple of gigabit ports on some of them.

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,280
The standard one only has one gigabit port.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,280
It's fanless.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,280
It's got this built-in cooling.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,280
One with two gigabit ports?

10
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,280
Yeah.

11
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,280
Yeah.

12
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
Router bitches!

13
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,280
Yeah, and also no fans.

14
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
Look at that.

15
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,280
It's got the finned cooling there.

16
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,100
I think it's pretty cool.

17
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,520
One thing I'm not happy with these NUCs is the power supply, but this one looks like

18
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,240
it has an interlocking connector, a little bit better of a superior connector, which

19
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
would be better for production.

20
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,080
Like, I want to put these in a rack and make them Skype rigs.

21
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,080
Pretty cool.

22
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,400
I know, it's overkill, but they're pretty neat.

23
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,640
Using the 14 nanometer Broadwell processors.

24
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,960
These are kind of cool.

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,400
Look at this, Alan.

26
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
This is perfect.

27
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,000
It's got a serial port right here on the front for you.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,520
I saw one, the newer ones with a serial port demonstrated, it got a live demo of Xen with

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,920
FreeBSD as a host at AsianBSDCon.

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,120
The guy brought a NUC that was all set up with FreeBSD Xen.

31
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,480
So FreeBSD was the host of the Xen virtualizer?

32
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,380
Yes, FreeBSD as DOM0.

33
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,380
How does that work?

34
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,380
Xen has been ported to FreeBSD.

35
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,240
I thought that was a Linux kernel thing.

36
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Nope.

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,440
Wow, that's pretty cool.

38
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,120
Now why would Beehive so close?

39
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,120
There's lots of people.

40
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,120
What's that?

41
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:34,360
Well, because Xen can run Windows on FreeBSD already, and Beehive is a long way off for

42
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
that.

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
Gotcha.

44
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Of course, that makes sense.

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Yeah.

46
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Okay.

47
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,280
Although Beehive is further ahead in hardware pass-through, but Xen will be able to catch

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
up more easily.

49
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,280
Hmm.

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Wow.

51
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,880
Basically, because Citrix realized that Linux is toxic.

52
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,120
Oh, ouch, Alan.

53
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
That hurts.

54
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
That hurts.

55
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
They don't want to be the next VMware.

56
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
Wow, Alan.

57
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Wow.

58
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Oh, my gosh.

59
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Look at you.

60
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
Nice.

61
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Those are good ones.

62
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
That's fine, Alan.

63
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
It doesn't hurt.

64
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
I wasn't trolling.

66
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,720
I felt like good trolling.

67
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,720
We believe you.

68
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,720
It's very good trolling.

69
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
I understand.

70
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:17,120
At the same time, people just don't want to get sued.

71
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,360
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's feeling the luck of the Irish.

72
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,680
My name is Chris.

73
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,680
And my name is Matt.

74
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
Hey, Matt.

75
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,040
Happy St. Patrick's Day, Terry.

76
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,960
Are you doing anything to celebrate the festivities today?

77
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,520
Realizing that everything I own that is green, it is dirty, and I am hiding in my house because

78
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
of it.

79
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
You know what I mean.

80
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
Yeah.

81
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Yeah.

82
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
It's a good call, Matt.

83
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
It's a good call.

84
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Yeah.

85
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,360
See, the St. Patrick's Day, see, we're not big on the drinking these days, but we wanted

86
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
to make it special.

87
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,680
So eight years ago on St. Patrick's Day, I married the wife, the Angela Fisher.

88
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Yeah.

89
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
So today's our anniversary.

90
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,040
We're going to have a little bit of extra fun on St. Patrick's Day.

91
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,560
So also a special happy anniversary to Angela.

92
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,340
And I'll be going home after Linux Unplugged, and maybe we'll do something fun for dinner.

93
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,600
But we today have a great show, even though I don't think anybody's drinking.

94
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,160
Man, we screwed that one up.

95
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,280
I don't have any beer in the studio today.

96
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,400
But we do have a great show coming up.

97
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,160
I have a make good first.

98
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,520
Just a little bit towards the feedback.

99
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,680
In the feedback, I wanted to play an interview with an Ubuntu representative at scale a couple

100
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,440
of weeks ago, but we had some clipping in the video, so I said, ah, scrap it, scrap

101
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
it.

102
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
Well, I went back.

103
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
I figured out why it was clipping.

104
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,520
And I pulled out probably the most important bit.

105
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,760
And that is, Noah says, well, what are you guys going to do to challenge Android in the

106
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,760
market share?

107
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
He pins that question on him.

108
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,360
And then after he answers that question, Noah says, OK, so what are you going to do to get

109
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,480
desktop staples like Thunderbird to work in a converged environment?

110
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,720
And he has an answer for that.

111
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Two great questions.

112
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
So I pulled those out.

113
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm going to go through those and see what Canonical's answer is in a converged desktop.

114
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,280
But Matt, we have a lot of things to get to, like the ultimate Linux laptop.

115
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,680
We got we got a lot of things, Matt, but right now we got to stop and recognize that something

116
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:13,560
very important has happened in the world of Linux today, Tuesday, March 17th, 2015.

117
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,000
Bioshock graces Linux.

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,880
Right now I have it installed on my machine upstairs, Bioshock Infinite is officially

119
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,400
available for Linux, a little bit of a mixed blessing, a really good game, really.

120
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:34,480
I played I actually installed the trial, you know, like 120 day eval of Windows 8 to try

121
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
this game.

122
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,320
I was so excited and I loved it.

123
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,560
I just couldn't stand using Windows.

124
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,840
So I quit playing and I said, I'll just wait for Linux.

125
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,840
Now I know I love the game.

126
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,840
I already own it.

127
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
I'll just wait for Linux.

128
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
I don't ever do that.

129
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,000
There's no exception with this game.

130
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,920
And I really, really enjoyed it.

131
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,680
Today I downloaded and started playing again.

132
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,240
It was it was working beautifully.

133
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,720
I have it set to max settings, full screen resolution, which on my 2K monitor looks really

134
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
great.

135
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,880
However, it is using that same Eon wrapper that the Witcher 2 was using that got a lot

136
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,440
of criticism.

137
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,320
Well, so the $10,000 question is, how is it affecting performance?

138
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,680
Because that's my that's always my go to thing before we get into like, you know, whether

139
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
it's right or wrong.

140
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,180
I think it's too early to say because last time we had this come out, you know, I didn't

141
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,480
have any performance issues.

142
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,420
Again, I don't have any performance issues.

143
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,320
But of course, I'm running it on an NVIDIA card, pretty modern driver set, pretty good

144
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,960
I7 off of the $10,000 RPM RAID 0 set of drives like it's a pretty good use case scenario

145
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,600
for something that's going to be heavy.

146
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,240
And they recommend, you know, the NVIDIA 340 graphics driver.

147
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,480
So it's semi recent and you know, at least a Radeon 7x or greater card.

148
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
I don't know.

149
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,480
I'm going to wait and see.

150
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,400
I think we have to see it on a wider range of hardware.

151
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,600
But it's at least a title that we can I mean, it's now available for Linux.

152
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,320
Oh, it'll get grief just as soon as they pull, you know, how they're doing it comes about,

153
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm sure.

154
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,600
But I think it's going to come down more to someone's, you know, whether or not that's

155
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,700
a concern for them based on principles, or whether or not they're just concerned about

156
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,320
whether or not a game is buggy or not.

157
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,800
Myself, I don't care if it runs on Cheetos, as long as it runs, it runs.

158
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,520
And who me points out Aeon has gotten better since the Witcher 2 release and they have,

159
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,520
you know, here's one thing to consider is it is it is very easy from a non developers

160
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,860
perspective to sit back on the side and go, Oh, well, it's using some sort of API translator,

161
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,520
it must be inferior.

162
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,440
But the reality is, is you and I, for most, for most of us, we have no idea how game development

163
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
works.

164
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,160
They're, they're, they're probably using several layers of abstraction already from the tools

165
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,760
are using to develop the game, right?

166
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,120
I mean, all of this stuff is already pulled way away from the metal as it is.

167
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,480
So we really don't know what we're talking about it is, is for all we know, perhaps using

168
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,920
well proven and laid out development methods that they can then just easily wrap some API's

169
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
around.

170
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Maybe that is a better way to go.

171
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Who knows?

172
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
I don't.

173
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
But I do know the game's now available.

174
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,600
And I was able to play it for about 20 minutes today before the show started.

175
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,240
And I really enjoyed myself.

176
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,280
For me, it was worth the price.

177
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,200
But I would say if you're concerned, and I think maybe there's a reason to be based on

178
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,960
previous games, why not wait a week or two?

179
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,800
You know, you know, the Linux game cast guys are going to review it at some point, see

180
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
what they're going to say.

181
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,580
Go read the reviews on Steam, go check out Linux underscore gaming on Reddit, there's

182
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,200
already a thread going about how it's working for people and the kind of performance they're

183
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
seeing.

184
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
So go check out all of that.

185
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Before we move off of this, Derek Delvin, you had something you wanted to add.

186
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:34,840
Yeah, for me as a developer, that's precisely why I care if they're using a wrapper or not,

187
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,760
because I know that when they are not using a wrapper, they're actually saying that, okay,

188
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,880
Linux has the APIs required to make a good game happen.

189
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,920
And Linux provides the capabilities needed for a developer.

190
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,000
Now, yes, I understand that they're doing a port of an existing game, but still, it

191
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,080
doesn't show appreciation or doesn't actually endorse Linux, it just says we have a market

192
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,080
on it.

193
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,960
No, see, this game is in that category of games that were developed many years ago.

194
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,960
If you think about when that game came to market, how many years under development was

195
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
it?

196
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,080
So by the time it comes to market, they've already bet on a different type of technology

197
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,200
platform, and there's just no financial sense in reworking that for a platform that has

198
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,640
a tiny market share.

199
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,220
So these wrappers make a lot of sense.

200
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,920
But if you were to start a game today and say take advantage of something like the Unreal

201
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,000
Ford engine, well, then you're going to have a first-class Linux game.

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And I don't really think it's so much of a statement on the state of Linux, because you

203
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,560
can do it today with a first-class game using the right tools.

204
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,680
I think it's more a statement on how much it's worth it.

205
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:45,320
If this platform was worth it for them, you could see some companies maybe going in and

206
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,360
doing a complete rewrite to make it work for the iPad, because they could make thousands

207
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,640
and thousands and thousands of dollars an hour on the iPad.

208
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,160
But you're not going to see that when they're going to sell maybe 1% to 2% to 5% of their

209
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,120
overall sales go to Linux.

210
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,920
That is not worth a complete rewrite.

211
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,440
What it really is is to check off that box, and now you can say this title is available

212
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,000
for the SteamOS platform.

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,960
Sure, but then I think it's the way that you spread the message, right?

214
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,240
Now on Linux, that kind of is a little bit misleading, you know?

215
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,440
And also, it's not that they couldn't have used this thing a while back as well, because

216
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,520
if it was just quote-unquote easy to use a shim to see and explore the waters of the

217
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,240
platform, so they already had that thing.

218
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,720
Because apparently, they didn't create one new shim, they are just using some that already

219
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,720
existed.

220
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,440
Although Eon claims the shim is customized for each game.

221
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Okay.

222
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,640
Yeah, I know, I know.

223
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,320
Do you know if this actually came from the dev studio, or is some company like Eon coming

224
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,360
up to the development studio and saying, let us be the guys who port it for you, or shim

225
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,480
it for you, or whatever you want to call it, and the original developers have nothing to

226
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,520
do with the Linux version?

227
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Which way is it?

228
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,520
No, no, no.

229
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,800
I mean, of course they still have, the original developers still have something to do with

230
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,040
it, but yeah, a lot of times they contract it out to, not in this case, but in some cases

231
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,800
companies like Aspire and others that handle that aspect of the port.

232
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,520
I just remember how it was with the original Torchlight, where the guy who was contracted

233
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:39,400
to do it, he actually made like a full fledged port where he ripped out the original game

234
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:47,800
engine, whatever it was, and put Ogre 3D instead in there, and it was buggy, and Bruny Games

235
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:55,160
did not want to support it, because it was, a solid portion of it wasn't even their code.

236
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:04,600
So this is, porting games is a very, very complicated thing, and I think, like you mentioned

237
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:12,480
before, we just have to set our expectations to reflect whatever game developers think

238
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,600
they can make by, how much money they can make by porting the games to Linux.

239
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,680
I'm going to sit back and see what the reviews say, and Matt, you wrote an article this week,

240
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,000
I was just going to point people's attention to, because we've been getting a lot of questions

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,680
into the show about VoIP solutions for Linux, so kind of perfect timing, you had a state

242
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,240
of VoIP and Linux right up over at DataMation, and I love it, because you touch on Skype,

243
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,480
which of course is the go-to, you've got Jitsi in here, which I've been playing more and

244
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,620
more with, and you nailed Jitsi, it's got its good and its bad in here, and of course

245
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,400
the classic Ekejia, so it's a good write-up, good timing.

246
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,280
Oh, I appreciate that, and it's something that Noah and I have actually gone back and

247
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,380
forth, when you guys were first kind of coming into the changeover for Linux Action Show,

248
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,040
we were kind of looking at the different clients and fallback clients and things like that,

249
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,040
and it's not that cut and dry, it's like, when it comes to video, you're looking at

250
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,220
WebRTC solutions, that's my opinion, I swear by them now, I've been playing with this one

251
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:17,360
for a while, it's awesome, it's stupid easy, there's no configuration, anything on Linux,

252
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,600
I think it's going to be Skype or that, I don't think anything else is going to matter.

253
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah, and you talk about, Matt talks about his favorite in the article and some of the

254
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,840
key differences between it and Skype, so check it out, yeah, and I agree, I played with them

255
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,520
for the BSD Now Show, and we really liked a couple of them, but all of them had a local

256
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,280
preview of my camera that I couldn't turn off, because I forgot somebody else's face

257
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,280
or something, which made it hard to use for production.

258
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,720
Yeah, exactly, it's the kind of stuff you don't even care about until you're doing

259
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,640
a production, like, oh wait, I can't have a preview video, because that's in the shot,

260
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,920
I can't have it in the shot, that's a practice.

261
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,680
It's covering half of Chris's face when we were doing, if it was just me and Chris, it

262
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,000
worked fine, but if we were trying to have a third person on for the interview, it would

263
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,940
cover a quarter of Chris's face with a preview of my face, and people only need one of my

264
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
face at a time.

265
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,940
That's an excellent point.

266
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,440
Well, I don't know, you can never have too much Alan face, but I guess we just have to

267
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
agree to some.

268
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,960
So we actually emailed one of the WebRTC platforms asking if they could make an option to hide

269
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,400
that or turn it off or something for us, although I don't know what happened back.

270
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:20,840
I think that would be very easy to do in Firefox Hello, but unfortunately Firefox Hello doesn't

271
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,680
currently support conference calls, so it's just two people.

272
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,520
I think you could do it in Jitsi Web, but I can't remember.

273
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,920
Well, some of the options that I highlighted, you can actually do conference calls, you

274
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,760
could do screen sharing via extension, which worked out really well.

275
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,240
Chris put all the effort into getting all the screen sharing and stuff working in Firefox

276
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:44,260
on PCVSD, so it all shifts by default working perfectly now, so that we could also do tutorials

277
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,080
that way.

278
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,720
But then my face covers up part of his face.

279
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,340
Yeah, and I'm with you on that.

280
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,000
That's a big, big not going to work in production at all.

281
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,120
That's a big thing that needs to be resolved for sure.

282
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,720
But you know, the nice thing is that there can be different implementations of it, and

283
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,000
you know once it really gains traction, you know there's going to be one for podcasters

284
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and people.

285
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,120
Well, that's the thing is that WebRTC is just so close to being perfect, using one thing.

286
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
Yeah, yeah.

287
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
It's like everything open source.

288
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Yeah, aww.

289
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
But it'll get there.

290
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
I think it will.

291
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Yes, I think it will.

292
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
Yeah, I think somebody will close the gap.

293
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,280
And then somebody should, you know, some pioneering podcast network should just make a product

294
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
and just sell it.

295
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
There you go.

296
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:31,520
Well, if what you're using is open source, it shouldn't be too hard to remove your face

297
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,240
from being displayed at all.

298
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,320
You should just have to delete like three lines of code and it should work.

299
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,680
The other thing that was difficult is Firefox didn't want to use a different playback device.

300
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,760
I can pick which camera and microphone to use.

301
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
It's got to be your default system.

302
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
I couldn't force it.

303
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Yeah.

304
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,320
And for the podcast, I want that to be different.

305
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
Yes.

306
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
Yeah.

307
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Sometimes multiple audios.

308
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Yeah.

309
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
All right.

310
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,240
So we're going to get to an email that came in that agrees with everything Wimpy had to

311
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
say recently.

312
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,840
So we'll talk about that in just a moment.

313
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,080
But first, I should probably take just a moment here to thank our friends over at Ting.

314
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,400
I have just so many good things to say about my Ting GSM service on the Nexus 5.

315
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:19,400
I have gotten so excited at simple things these days.

316
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,480
I don't know what it is about it, but the combination of the Pebble Watch with the Nexus

317
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,680
5 on Lollipop, unlocked on the GSM network, I feel like I have finally hit like the trifecta

318
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,000
of amazing.

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,100
And the great thing is, is not only do I have just amazing coverage here at the studio,

320
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,160
but I'm on Wi-Fi, so it's not like a huge deal.

321
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,760
But my drive now is just impeccable coverage, spotless coverage.

322
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,000
So yeah, I'm having all fun, I'm downloading podcasts, I'm streaming stuff a little bit.

323
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But why not?

324
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,400
It's like it's great coverage.

325
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,120
And that's one of the things I love about Ting is because I'm just paying for what

326
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
I use.

327
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,480
So if I want to have a little fun, I don't have to worry about going over on some plan.

328
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,680
That's not how it works with Ting.

329
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,900
You just pay for your usage.

330
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,520
It's a flat $6 for the line.

331
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,360
And then Ting just takes your minutes and your messages and your megabytes, they add

332
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,400
them up and that's just what you pay.

333
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
I've got three lines.

334
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,120
I've got an iPhone 5, an HTC One and a Nexus 5.

335
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:19,440
Now the Nexus 5 is my daily driver and I have it totally tricked out these days to you guys.

336
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,720
So I have if this, then that all set up on here so it's like tracking all my time.

337
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,240
I've got automatic so I'm tracking all my car information and I'm logging my miles for

338
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,920
taxes and it's all powered by the Ting network and so I always have connectivity.

339
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm always either on Wi-Fi or Ting GSM.

340
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,600
I love the coverage.

341
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,560
And I love too that if I need to go somewhere maybe they have better CDMA coverage, I can

342
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,160
always switch my Nexus 5 back because the Nexus 5 can do either or.

343
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,360
That is so slick.

344
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,920
And right now if you go over to Ting, go to linux.ting.com.

345
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,040
Go there, that will support our show and give you a $25 off any device you want to buy from

346
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,500
Ting or $25 service credit.

347
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,960
Something you might want to consider picking up is the Ting GSM card.

348
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,320
You go to linux.ting.com, they give you $25 of credit because this GSM card is only $9.

349
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,680
This GSM card is you pop out what if you need a micro or a regular, whatever you need, they're

350
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,320
all the different cutouts already there and you pop it in your device.

351
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,280
Noah's got a couple of phones he uses as sort of like bat lines.

352
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,580
My buddy Chase from Unfilter uses this for his home security system.

353
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,720
You know you could put this on a module with a Raspberry Pi.

354
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,280
I mean there's so many, $9 and you have a GSM card.

355
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,680
And then it's $6 for the line and just your usage.

356
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,560
So if it's something that's going to send an occasional report or something you check

357
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,040
remotely from your phone from time to time, it is such an economical way to do that.

358
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,000
Or you know $9 for the SIM card and then it's $6 for the line and you can turn it on and

359
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
off too by the way.

360
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,760
So you don't always even have to be paying the $6.

361
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,760
You can throw it in.

362
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,720
If you've got a tablet that has a GSM SIM slot, throw it in there and then when you

363
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
do need it you just turn it on and you have data.

364
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,920
Or if you've got an old GSM phone, I mean like you can take advantage of the CDMA network

365
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,920
or the GSM network.

366
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,920
It's really cool.

367
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,880
And you can start it by going to linux.ting.com, $25 off that device or service credit and

368
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
go check out their blog.

369
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
They've always got lots of good information.

370
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,200
Like they just broke down like what all the different phone acronyms are for like the

371
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,920
different codes like in the phone that you have to like give in when you're activating

372
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,920
stuff.

373
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,400
They also have a savings calculator so you can put your current usage in there and see

374
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
how much you would save.

375
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,000
Linux.ting.com, go check them out.

376
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,480
No hold customer service too, 1855-TINGFTW and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux

377
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Unplugged.

378
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,360
Linux.ting.com, thanks you guys.

379
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,760
Really appreciate the, really now the long term support of the Linux Unplugged show.

380
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,420
They were one of the first sponsors because they really thought the show, you know a community

381
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,360
focused show was somewhere they wanted to be and I really appreciate that vote of confidence.

382
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,880
So linux.ting.com is a great way to support the show.

383
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
Thanks Ting.

384
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,520
Okay, so we got an email into the show that wanted to touch on a point that Wimpy had

385
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,200
made about virtual reality recently in the pre-show.

386
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,800
Brian writes in, he says, episode 82 goes down as one of my favorite pre-shows ever.

387
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,320
I love the debate between Wimpy and Popey, it was excellent.

388
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,160
And I have to agree with Wimpy.

389
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,320
During college in 92 and 93, I recall the same 15 pound headset and getting some belt

390
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,940
on to move around, this time it was a line art world, and lob some weird projectiles

391
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,040
at another player.

392
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,280
Amazing for the time, but I definitely didn't see the push for 20 years later.

393
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,920
To Popey's point, the world always moves to how do we get this in the hands of the average

394
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,120
consumer, and that's where we're at now.

395
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,280
Thanks for the laughs and memories.

396
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,960
And to your point Wimpy, you were essentially saying you think that VR is just another fad

397
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
again, right?

398
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,960
Yeah, yeah, I think it is.

399
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,120
And I think I've come to an agreement with you.

400
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
You know I was-

401
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Oh, really?

402
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah, and I know, and I'm an Oculus SDK owner, and when I put it on I felt like this is an

403
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,040
amazing game changer, like life changing technology, and I believe that statement to be true.

404
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,840
I just don't think we'll ever manage to reach mass adoption.

405
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,040
Not the way our world works anymore.

406
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,000
There's already competing standards before a single headset's really even made it to

407
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,400
the mainstream market.

408
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,880
And now what's likely to make it to the market first in the fall is Samsung VR, which is

409
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,220
a watered down version of Oculus VR, because it has to only work on mobile, which makes

410
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,680
it easier for the average person, but it means you're limited to mobile games, and you don't

411
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,960
get the super immersive experiences that you get with the desktop games.

412
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,560
And that's just a fact.

413
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,200
And that's going to be a watered down experience, and it's not anything I'm all that interested

414
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
in.

415
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
I'm interested in the game changer.

416
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
But I just don't see it.

417
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Three, four wires coming out of my head.

418
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
I've got to hook up HDMI.

419
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,840
I've got to hook up two USB things, and I've got to hook up an infrared webcam.

420
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,320
I've got to have that position just right.

421
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,920
I've got to set up the mirroring just correct, and then I've got to make sure I have the

422
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,080
correct version of the game that supports the Oculus.

423
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,080
Yeah.

424
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,520
Now I know they could make that easier, but it's a long way from being easy enough for

425
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,920
the average consumer, and I just don't think it's going to make it.

426
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,880
And that makes me super bummed, because I think it could be amazing.

427
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,360
I think there's all kinds of applications, teleconferencing, podcasting, gaming, parenting,

428
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,360
education.

429
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,020
Oh man, so many educational opportunities for VR.

430
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,680
So I hope they don't quit working on it.

431
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:56,260
But you know, Samsung said that by the end of the year, VR, they were going to blast

432
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:59,120
the market with VR, and I don't think it's going to go anywhere by the end of the year.

433
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,800
I think we'll be having the same discussion in 2016.

434
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
That's just me though.

435
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,560
You know, I would like to see, I think probably, honestly, and this is going to sound terrible,

436
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:13,560
how cool would it be to have like, to actually experience people's careers and things like

437
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
that.

438
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
Or even Driver's Ed.

439
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Although it would probably be something like GTA, but whatever.

440
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
You know, I mean it would be interesting.

441
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
I know, yeah.

442
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,640
You know, what it's like to be a surgeon for a day, that could be a little scary, but you

443
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
know.

444
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,320
Think about movies in virtual reality, the way you could present movies, right?

445
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Screw VR.

446
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
I mean, screw 3D.

447
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,000
I want a virtual reality movie.

448
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,560
Yeah, Daryl, go ahead, you had a point to make.

449
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,160
I was just thinking that perhaps it won't happen the way we're looking at, just consumer

450
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,480
products directly, because actually there is the untapped professional market.

451
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:52,760
So currently there are already extremely expensive simulators for avionics or even, you know,

452
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,480
trying cars and things like that.

453
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,080
So I think those environments will get it first.

454
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
And I could see military applications.

455
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
Exactly.

456
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,800
And it will increase the production of these devices, which will significantly decrease

457
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,000
the cost of production, which means that then it's accessible to the user market.

458
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,880
So I think that's the most likely path.

459
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
I have two comments.

460
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,900
I think along with that, I think also high-end gaming, because there you have a user base

461
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,840
that's savvy enough to hook up HDMI and multiple USBs and understands the difference between

462
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,320
USB 2 and 3 and video mirroring.

463
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,520
So then I think that bodes well for Valve and Steam Machines, because again, you know,

464
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,780
Steam Machines are going to be much more accommodating to a VR headset than like a console will be.

465
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,040
So if that does enter the market and it's something high-end gamers want, Valve and

466
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,800
Steam Machines will be uniquely positioned to take advantage of that.

467
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,880
But at the same time, I really worry deeply that it's all going to be proprietary and

468
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,160
that open source and Linux will be the losers, because so much of this stuff depends on,

469
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:51,400
take your pick, incredible GPU compute power that demands proprietary drivers?

470
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,920
Check that box.

471
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,560
Maybe a back-end cloud infrastructure that requires a subscription and uses a ton of

472
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,720
proprietary software?

473
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
Check that box.

474
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,480
And in most cases, it's only really going to work very well on the Windows or Mac desktop,

475
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,600
so check that box.

476
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,720
So I'm a little concerned where we're going towards something here, where that leaves

477
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,400
Linux and open source.

478
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,240
Does anybody in the Mamba room have any thoughts?

479
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,360
That's actually interesting.

480
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,400
So I think because of what I just mentioned, there is also the likelihood of bringing attraction

481
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,720
back to the arcade places that, you know, you have these huge consoles.

482
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,800
People used to gather in these places and just play games.

483
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,720
But once you have the device in people's hands, I don't think, it's like, if it's not open

484
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,800
source by default, it will be.

485
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,520
This is like a rule of nature, almost.

486
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,680
Yeah, I suppose eventually, yeah, eventually we'll make an open source version.

487
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
That's true.

488
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
I shouldn't worry.

489
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,680
Yeah.

490
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,320
I'm hoping that happens with BitTorrent Sync too.

491
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Come on.

492
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
Come on.

493
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
Let's do BitTorrent Sync.

494
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
Let's make an open source clone.

495
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Let's do it, everybody.

496
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,320
Man.

497
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
All right.

498
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
All right.

499
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
All good things.

500
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
All good things.

501
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,320
And I continue to play with VR.

502
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Either way, I'll continue to play with it.

503
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
I don't care if everybody else.

504
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,920
I don't care if it gets wide adoption as long as I get to keep playing with it.

505
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,200
I have a make good I want to play before we jump into our next segment.

506
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,520
And I just, it was something I wanted to play a couple of weeks ago, but it was clipping

507
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,680
at the time.

508
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,600
And this is Nathan from Canonical.

509
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,440
He's at the Ubuntu booth.

510
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,920
And of course, they talk about all kinds of things.

511
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:22,640
But Noah had a chance to ask him specifically about challenging Android market share and

512
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,840
iOS market share.

513
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,260
And then also getting some of our classic favorite Linux apps on a converged desktop.

514
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,260
So I'll play that.

515
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,260
And here we go.

516
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:43,560
What's your guess on Ubuntu or Canonical's ability to leverage market penetration in

517
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,360
a very heavily populated iOS and Android world?

518
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,640
Well, when Android came out, I watched the I was interested.

519
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,520
I watched the press release.

520
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,400
And 15 minutes later when when the pre-orders opened, I bought one and waited a month and

521
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
got it.

522
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,680
And there are about 30 apps available for Android when it first came out.

523
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:10,600
And it was exciting because it was a Linux based phone that promised to be one one platform

524
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,980
across many different model phones.

525
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,060
And so I think it lived up to that.

526
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:20,360
But unfortunately, Google develops Android in secret and they do release it, throw the

527
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,680
code over the wall and that's it.

528
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,600
You take it or leave it.

529
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,520
Ubuntu, even on the phones developed, the exact same way Ubuntu is on the desktop, on

530
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,280
the server, on the cloud.

531
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
It's all done in the open.

532
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,960
You know, people criticize, well, this is looking rough or that's not ready yet.

533
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,360
But the thing is that, you know, Ubuntu cooked for three years before we even saw it.

534
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,320
Whereas this was done in the open starting from the desktop images.

535
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,640
And actually, Ubuntu on this phone is running 1504 or what will be 1504 in April.

536
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
And it's the exact same system.

537
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,180
But if I open the terminal, I have the user space, I have everything there.

538
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:58,240
So when I want to develop an app for the phone, if I don't have a phone or, you know, sometimes

539
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,760
this can be tricky, I can develop it on my Ubuntu desktop or laptop.

540
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
I run the app.

541
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,560
It comes up in a window with the right interface.

542
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,400
If I make the window bigger, that's a tablet interface.

543
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,920
I can also do a little work to make it work on the desktop if I want to.

544
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,320
And that exact same code, I bring it to my phone.

545
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,640
It's running the exact same code.

546
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,960
I get the exact same experience.

547
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
I can test it on the phone.

548
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,960
I can package it.

549
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,800
I can put it in the store.

550
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,200
I can run the same program everywhere.

551
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,640
So the development that I'm doing for the phone is identical to the development process

552
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,440
on my desktop, on my laptop, the same thing I'm doing on the server.

553
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,320
I get the same development story everywhere with Ubuntu.

554
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,760
Now, how about going the other way?

555
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,360
So for example, to the best of my knowledge, Thunderbird doesn't exist for Ubuntu Touch,

556
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,360
right?

557
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:46,160
So let's say I took the Ubuntu version of Thunderbird, is there a way I can put that

558
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
on the phone?

559
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,920
It would take a little bit of work, so we've done nothing to make that easy, but we've

560
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,360
done nothing to restrict that.

561
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,360
So...

562
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,360
Oh, fair enough.

563
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,540
So for example, about three weeks ago, Will Cook posted a picture of his Ubuntu phone

564
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,840
running LibreOffice, which I believe is probably the worst possible way to experience LibreOffice.

565
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:33,800
I'm going to pause right there now because he has more to say, but I don't want us to

566
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
lose track.

567
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,240
What you have to do is make a mobile interface.

568
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,000
Now that is sort of like the biggest but ever.

569
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,520
That's kind of like a one more thing that is this huge announcement, because if you

570
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,960
think about all LibreOffice has to do is make a mobile interface, well, yeah, yeah, that's

571
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,360
a huge challenge.

572
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,760
That's like the hardest thing possible for them probably.

573
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,800
So yeah, that doesn't mean it's necessarily easy, but he goes on to make the point that

574
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,320
it's at least the same code base underneath.

575
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:08,080
What you have to do is take your existing awesome Ubuntu app and optimize that for mobile.

576
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,680
And the Ubuntu SDK makes it really easy to build a really beautiful responsive interface

577
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,760
that spans from a phone to tablet to desktop without extra work.

578
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,240
That really lowers the barrier of entry.

579
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,680
So I think when developers begin developing for Ubuntu, they're going to find that it's

580
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,400
as easy and pleasant to develop for the phone as it is on the desktop, because it's all

581
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
Ubuntu.

582
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
It's all one code base.

583
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,920
That's pretty cool.

584
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,560
And of course, you know, I keep watching on Google+, I see more and more apps in Popey's

585
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,840
feed all the time, which look really cool.

586
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,280
And they're a little optimistic, though.

587
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,480
I mean, really, it's kind of, it's a little nonchalant to say all they have to do is make

588
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,760
a mobile interface.

589
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,600
It does feel like the, I don't want to say the buck's been passed, but it does feel like

590
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,520
it's been dismissed a touch, just a little.

591
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
Yeah.

592
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:03,760
I actually have tried developing for Ubuntu Touch.

593
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:12,120
And I have to say, well, yeah, there is a fairly big challenge with creating interfaces

594
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,560
for existing applications.

595
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:23,600
If you create a new application with Ubuntu Touch in mind, or even Ubuntu in general in

596
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:32,560
mind and you use Ubuntu SDK for it, then moving between desktop and tablets and phones becomes

597
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:42,120
very easy because their SDK actually, I was surprised how good of a job they did with

598
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,880
helping developers create interfaces that scale automatically.

599
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,760
I have that, by the way, linked in the show notes for today's episode.

600
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,240
Although, of course, what did you just say?

601
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,480
You just said it works great when you're writing applications for Ubuntu, right?

602
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,960
I like applications written for Linux, but that's cool.

603
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,960
I mean, I follow what you're saying.

604
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
And I'm sure-

605
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,760
There is no reason why you would not want to-

606
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Right.

607
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
It would just look like butt.

608
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
It would just look like butt.

609
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,760
But I could run them somewhere else.

610
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
Yeah, you could.

611
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,760
I would know-

612
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,240
There's no reason why you wouldn't be able to run it on other disk shows.

613
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Of course.

614
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
It would just look like an Ubuntu.

615
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
You just have to resolve that.

616
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Yeah.

617
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,560
It's the same way if you run a material design application from Android somewhere else, it

618
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,360
looks like an Android app.

619
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,200
Yeah, I suppose so.

620
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Which is-

621
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
I do have to say-

622
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Yeah.

623
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,880
That ultimately, toolkits are adapting.

624
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,480
If we look at the developments that are going to the toolkits are also contemplating these

625
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,920
new devices, these people's will to actually port things.

626
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:51,080
And we also need to acknowledge that once you move to a different platform, different

627
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,760
device, not always you expect the same amount of functionality.

628
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,800
Maybe you are just consuming, and maybe LibreOffice won't be so much as redesigning the interface,

629
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,960
but actually hiding more elements and not make them accessible to the same context menu,

630
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
for example.

631
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,320
Because that's not the experience you're expecting.

632
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,360
And that type of change is not as hard as actually going-

633
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,360
I agree.

634
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
Making a whole overhaul of the UI.

635
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Yes.

636
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,400
But if you're going with the right set of expectations, it's not so bad.

637
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,840
And Mike in the chat room is linking us to a video, which I'll try to remember to put

638
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,760
in the show notes, of LibreOffice running on Ubuntu Touch.

639
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,120
I'm just waiting for him to launch it right now.

640
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
So there's Google Maps.

641
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
Okay.

642
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
We see that.

643
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
I want to see LibreOffice though.

644
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
There he goes.

645
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
He's launching LibreOffice.

646
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:39,800
So you can see if you have a tablet, it just runs in like an XMirror window, and it's usable.

647
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,360
So I mean, of course, you would want to have a mouse and keyboard.

648
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,360
But you know, to be honest with you, I would prefer to have the option of carrying a mouse

649
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,080
and keyboard, like a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, with me in my bag, and be able to run LibreOffice

650
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
when I need it.

651
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,160
Like, for me, I like that.

652
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:01,000
I don't mind that it's even actual LibreOffice, because I know if I'm going to launch LibreOffice,

653
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,560
I know what to expect, and I'm going to bring a mouse and keyboard with me.

654
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,040
So for me, I think it's good.

655
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,660
I'm just saying for end users, they're going to look at that, and they'll- I mean, everybody

656
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,360
ridiculed Microsoft.

657
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,800
They ridiculed Microsoft when people got the Windows RT tablets and you dropped down to

658
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,320
the classic shell.

659
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
Ridiculed them for it.

660
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,800
Even though I kind of think it could be handy if you have the right set of tools.

661
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
So there you go.

662
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Yeah.

663
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,080
Just a little update, and it's an interesting discussion, and who knows.

664
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,240
I also wanted to mention Linux Fest Northwest.

665
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,440
I know I'm getting obnoxious, but it's the end of April, 25th and the 26th.

666
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,280
We're going to try to have as much of the crew there as possible, and have multiple

667
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,360
shows going on, and go around and say hi to people.

668
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,720
I got a little details this last Friday from the crew.

669
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,880
There's going to be a new after party at a new location, Matt?

670
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
Oh, really?

671
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Okay.

672
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,760
A three-story hotel, as a matter of fact, I believe.

673
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Or not a hotel, a museum, sorry.

674
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,360
And so it should be quite a hell of a show.

675
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,080
And then Friday night, for people that fly in early, Fedora is sponsoring a board game

676
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,400
night up in Bellingham.

677
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,200
So if you're getting in Friday night, the night before the fest officially starts, there

678
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,600
will be a Fedora-sponsored board game, I believe, at the Hampton, but you'll have to double

679
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
check on that.

680
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
I'll know soon.

681
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
Okay.

682
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
Yeah.

683
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
Yeah, so you said a museum.

684
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Is that correct?

685
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,080
I believe it is a museum, and I forget which one.

686
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,080
Because I'm racking my brain.

687
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,480
I think, when you said three stores, it's one that popped into my head instantly.

688
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
I'm wondering if it's that one.

689
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,480
Okay, cool.

690
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
It's cool, because check this out.

691
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,240
If you go over to linuxfestnorthwest.org, and you go scroll down to the best sponsors

692
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
section, so you've got gold sponsors.

693
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,280
Yeah, I'm sure gold sponsors are pretty important.

694
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
I wouldn't know.

695
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Yeah.

696
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
I don't care.

697
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,960
I don't care about gold sponsors.

698
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
Hold on.

699
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
My touch thing's gone crazy, Matt.

700
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
My touch thing's gone crazy.

701
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
But when you go down here, look here.

702
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Oh, media.

703
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
Jupiter Broadcasting.

704
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,960
Boom.

705
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
Right there.

706
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,960
There it is.

707
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Friday night is Fedora.

708
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Saturday night, that party at the museum is actually being paid for by Microsoft.

709
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,960
How about that?

710
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,960
Wow.

711
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
Yeah.

712
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,960
Wow.

713
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,960
I'm still reeling from last year, because they were downright civil, actually.

714
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,520
I was just kind of like, okay.

715
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,160
You know how expensive lanyards are?

716
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,160
It's ridiculous.

717
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,160
Yeah.

718
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
It's ridiculous.

719
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,040
Anyways, we're going to have lanyards at Linux Fest Northwest to give out.

720
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,600
It's going to be pretty cool.

721
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,960
So if you're going to make it, there is a hotel up in Bellingham, Washington that you'll

722
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,880
probably want to stay at.

723
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,600
They're going to have a special Linux Fest Northwest deal.

724
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,480
And I think if it's not attached to the hotel, it's close to the hotel.

725
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,960
And the best part is there's going to be a free shuttle between the hotel and the Linux

726
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,280
Fest Northwest campus.

727
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,140
So you'll want to stay at the Hampton Inn.

728
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,960
That's where they'll have the free shuttle.

729
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,120
And I believe Hampton Inn might even be at the Bellingham Airport if you can just fly

730
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
in right there.

731
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,680
And then you don't have to worry about transportation.

732
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:34,960
And you can also call them and take advantage of the Linux Fest Northwest special Hampton

733
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
Inn.

734
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,200
So it's not at the airport, but it is a short drive from the airport.

735
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,480
And they will pick you up from the airport if you call them.

736
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
Perfect.

737
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
Thank you, Blaster.

738
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,480
Thank you.

739
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Is that where you stayed last year?

740
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,480
Yes, it is.

741
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,480
It's where I'm staying this year.

742
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,480
Yeah.

743
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,480
That's the one that the Fest guys also recommend you stay at.

744
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,400
So you got to dial in over there, Blaster.

745
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
Thank you, sir.

746
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
Appreciate that info.

747
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,680
And I'd love to see anybody in the audience there.

748
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,980
It should be a great show.

749
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,040
And if you can't make it, we are intending to live stream the hell out of it.

750
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,840
So we'll probably be live Saturday and Sunday from there.

751
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
So you can check it out.

752
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
I think it should be an honor.

753
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
It's one of the best.

754
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,400
I think it's one of the best shows in the US if you can make it.

755
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
All right.

756
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,280
Before we get to our next topic, which possibly promises to be the perfect Linux laptop, but

757
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,560
Chris is a little skeptical, I want to tell you about our next sponsor, and that's Digital

758
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Ocean.

759
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,540
Digital Ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to making my data center dreams

760
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,540
come true.

761
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
No, I kid.

762
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,840
No, they're really dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud

763
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
server.

764
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Now, they are my data center.

765
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,720
I mean, it's a no brainer why I can get started in less than 55 seconds and you can too.

766
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,240
And pricing plans start only $5 a month that'll get you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte

767
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,400
SSD, one CPU and a terabyte, a terabyte, a freaking terabyte, a terabyte of transfer.

768
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Terabyte.

769
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,960
Listen, if you don't have a huge podcast, just go stick it up on a digital ocean droplet.

770
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,600
It's cheaper than anything else for $5.

771
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,600
I mean, I don't, I seriously starting out if I could have done that, it'd have been

772
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
great.

773
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,520
These days though, these days scale engines the way for me.

774
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,360
I tell you what, but when I started out, I think I would have probably had my website

775
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,280
on one droplet, my MP3 files on another droplet and like my forms on, I mean, why not at $5?

776
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,200
You could honestly, you could load them all up on one droplet, but I, from a security

777
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,720
standpoint and a maintenance standpoint and the value is just so insane that I just, I'll

778
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,400
just spin up multiple droplets.

779
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,600
So for me, I've got droplets dedicated to specific functionalities.

780
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,240
Now, some of them do a bunch of other extra things too, they're not one job, but looking

781
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,120
back now at how I've built infrastructures in the past, I've sort of been revising them

782
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,760
in my head, like kind of daydreaming, if I was going to do that again, how would I do

783
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,040
it on digital ocean?

784
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,120
And I think podcast hosting is one of the first things I would, I would do on digital

785
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
ocean.

786
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
Of course, there's so many other things too.

787
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,640
And of course they have one click installations for things like WordPress or Drupal or Ruby

788
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,680
on Rails or GitLab too.

789
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,000
And they have data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam

790
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,440
and London.

791
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
It's really though their interface.

792
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
It's so great.

793
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,680
They have a really intuitive control panel and power users can replicate it on a larger

794
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,540
scale with the company's straightforward API.

795
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,280
And it really is handy because there's a bunch of great apps you can take advantage of, or

796
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,640
if you're a little savvy yourself, you don't have to be all that savvy, you can just put

797
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,400
something together pretty quickly.

798
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,380
But there's a lot of like, there's desktop apps, there's mobile apps, there's things

799
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,680
to snap it in with existing projects, modules for programming languages.

800
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,280
I mean, it's really well done.

801
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,600
And then to sort of round it all off, they have a great, great set of always improving

802
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
tutorials.

803
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,400
They've also recently launched free BSD support.

804
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,520
That's pretty cool too.

805
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,920
So here's how you can get started.

806
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,720
You get a $10 credit over at digital ocean.

807
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,760
This is key because they've got a lot of great things you can try like CoreOS or the one

808
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,800
click deployments or, you know, try out their snapshot system, which is really nice.

809
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,880
I really like the way their snapshots work.

810
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,880
Try it out.

811
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,480
You can try it all out and you'll get a $10 credit when you use our promo code DOUNPLUGED.

812
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,320
DOUNPLUGED, all one word, lowercase, just apply that to your account and then just try

813
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,760
the $5 rig two months for free, get your own Linux rig, root access, you get HTML5 console.

814
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,400
And if you've played around with VMs and you've never really gone off and set off your own

815
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,040
offsite backup server or something like that, just do it this route.

816
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,320
This is so much better and it's so fast and the value is incredible.

817
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
You'll really have a good time.

818
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,320
DigitalOcean.com, promo code DOUNPLUGED.

819
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,160
Matt, I'm a bit of a hardware head.

820
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,760
I mean, I'm pretty solid on laptops right now.

821
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,800
I've got the Librem coming eventually and I got the XPS 13 because I think if you're

822
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,920
going to get a non-System 76 laptop, like if you want sort of like the MacBook Air kind

823
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,760
of competitor with the super high resolution, like 4K screen, I think the XPS 13 is a serious

824
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,340
contender and I think a lot of people will be looking at it to load Linux.

825
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,360
That's why I picked it up so I could try it out.

826
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,760
And Dell has since then released another workstation.

827
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,640
They call it part of their Sputnik project.

828
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,800
It's the M3800 developer edition and it's kind of like a MacBook Pro competitor.

829
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,040
And I think Ars Technica has the review to read on this.

830
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,980
They really have a great write-up and they talk about some of the issues that I've ran

831
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,980
into.

832
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,760
So I wanted to commiserate a little bit about my continued search for like my quote-unquote

833
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,420
perfect Linux laptop and then I kind of wanted to take some opinions from you guys too.

834
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,780
But first, let's start on a little bit of the review here.

835
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:12,020
So to begin with, the price, about $1,500 at base, the one they tested at Ars, a little

836
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,480
over $2,000.

837
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,200
And again, it's the M3800, ships with Ubuntu 14.04.

838
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,060
It has a high-quality build, no squeaks, no rattles, 16 gigabytes of RAM.

839
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,600
He got it with a 256-gigabyte SSD and i7 CPU.

840
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,800
Display is bright, beautiful.

841
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,720
Thunderbolt port on it though, doesn't really work well with Ubuntu except for video.

842
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,120
I ran into that same issue.

843
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,320
Applications are not really ready for high DPI, like Chrome, and it ships with Chrome

844
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
as default.

845
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
It just does not look good in high DPI.

846
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,560
That is a continued problem I have too.

847
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,620
Opera, much better.

848
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:55,800
And it has a few other things like battery life when the NVIDIA GPU is devastating.

849
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,560
When I got my XPS 13, Dell quoted me 15 hours of battery life.

850
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,320
And I've even heard some podcasters going, well, look at Dell's new laptops with 15 hours.

851
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Yeah, BS.

852
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,760
I'm getting seven hours, eight hours tops.

853
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
Perfectly fine.

854
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
I don't really mind.

855
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,120
But it's no 15 hours.

856
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,920
So I wasn't surprised that he dinged that for the review.

857
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,920
But I was looking at this thing.

858
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
It's big.

859
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,920
It's 15 inches.

860
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,960
And I'm trying to think to myself, what makes the perfect Linux laptop?

861
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,800
And this is something I've searched for, and searched for, and searched for.

862
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,680
Colonel Linux, I don't know if you're still in.

863
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
Did you leave?

864
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,520
Because I know he's, yeah, because he's just recently got a new laptop too, but he vacated.

865
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,440
And it's something that when I searched for, I'm pretty happy with the XPS 13.

866
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:40,040
But the biggest downside for me is Linux's high DPI support is still pretty sucky, unfortunately.

867
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,040
Yeah.

868
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,840
Matt, for you, are you a laptop guy at all?

869
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,640
Yeah, I had one.

870
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,400
It's long since left the building.

871
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,300
But for me, it was basically a matter of, I don't like the glossy screen.

872
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,800
I want it to be matted.

873
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,600
That's just for my own eyes.

874
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,800
Does it manage to handle a wireless end connection?

875
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Cool.

876
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,040
It's the battery life at minimum of three hours, preferably more, if it is, great.

877
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,800
And then, of course, just the keyboard not spongy.

878
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
That's another thing.

879
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
I can't stand that.

880
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
Right.

881
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
You know?

882
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
Yeah.

883
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,800
And then touchpad sensitivity.

884
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,280
Can I, what are my options as far as disabling it?

885
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,000
I know a couple of hacks that I can use to disable a touchpad while typing, but a lot

886
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,200
of times you can actually get a touchpad that will work correctly when you set it to turn

887
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
off.

888
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:30,200
I noticed, too, that Dell, so the XPS 13 I got came with a Broadcom Dell proprietary

889
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,880
Linux not very happy loving kind of wireless driver, or wireless card, and I swapped it

890
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,160
out with an Intel 7000 series, which is the same one they ship, yeah, the AC7260, which

891
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,840
is the same one that Dell's put in this laptop.

892
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,520
So I would imagine that would avoid the out of the box wireless issue, which was my primary

893
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,680
issue when I tried my XPS 13 is my wireless didn't work out of the box.

894
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,160
I don't think this is a particularly good looking laptop either.

895
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,000
Unfortunately I think Dell kind of has a bit of a miss here.

896
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,960
I think the XPS 13 is a lot more competitive than this, but you know.

897
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
Could be.

898
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
It really could be.

899
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,960
Look at that.

900
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
And it still has the Windows sticker on the bottom, Matt.

901
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:11,640
Well, I mean, I go back to, I mean, actually years before I even was a part of Jupiter

902
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,500
Broadcasting years ago when I first came to System76, what brought me to it was after

903
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:21,320
a interesting Dell experience and dating back to when I went and actually bought the laptop

904
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,000
from them, which they promptly lost.

905
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,520
But when I bought the laptop from them, they were still recommending Office and various

906
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,480
Windows software after I designated, I mean, it's just like, really?

907
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,840
It's like, I mean, come on guys.

908
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,560
So you know, for me, it's just like, eh, you know, they could, they could come out with

909
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,960
the coolest thing in the world.

910
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,480
Honestly, I, I, I've been burned by them so badly.

911
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
I don't know.

912
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,720
I'd have a real hard time with it.

913
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,400
I, Wimpy, I'm curious, what makes your perfect Linux laptop?

914
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,760
What is it for you that makes a good machine that specifically to run Linux?

915
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:59,480
Uh, well, there's a couple of things, um, I like lightweight, so not, not very big.

916
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,240
And I like a proper keyboard.

917
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:06,440
So, um, and I've got a ponch on for the old, um, track point nipple.

918
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,440
Right.

919
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,440
Yeah.

920
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,440
Yeah.

921
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:16,920
So mostly I buy, um, relatively old secondhand ThinkPads.

922
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:23,560
So my newest computer to me is a ThinkPad X201, which I think is about five years old.

923
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:28,600
Uh, and that's quite good for me cause it's an i5 and everything.

924
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,800
And um, battery life is important too.

925
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,200
And the ThinkPads are good in that regard.

926
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:41,680
And if you pair, pair your Linux machine with, um, TLP, um, you can, you can probably get

927
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,680
in some cases.

928
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Go on.

929
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,240
Well, so what you're telling me is essentially, uh, what makes the perfect Linux laptop is

930
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,800
a Lenovo, but what do you do if say Lenovo starts making you unhappy?

931
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Where do you go?

932
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,280
Like, are all your eggs in one basket?

933
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,480
Uh, well, they, they've suited me so far, but no, I mean, companies like System76 would

934
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,240
be where I would have to go for a new machine.

935
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:11,840
Um, the problem is, is that I can't afford the, you know, the upfront price for a new

936
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,960
machine from those companies.

937
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,720
So if I needed a new computer, I'd have to save for some considerable time before I could

938
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,720
afford one.

939
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,400
But you know, there are places I could go.

940
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,400
Mm hmm.

941
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,400
Mm hmm.

942
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,760
Uh, so the screenshot I'm showing here from Mars Technica kind of shows you how the web

943
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,640
renders on the Chromium browser on a high DBI display.

944
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,640
It's tiny.

945
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,360
It looks good and Unity itself does a good job of scaling up and other GTK applications

946
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,640
will do a good job of scaling up, but yeah, it's kind of hit and miss.

947
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,440
I feel, I feel like if I was, if somebody came to me and said, I don't have a lot of

948
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,080
money to spend, uh, but I really want a high resolution display, I would say at this point,

949
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:53,000
if you're tight on money, don't get a 4k display because a lot of stuff looks fine, but a lot

950
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
of stuff doesn't look fine.

951
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,580
And if you are powering that with an Intel GPU, there are times that will work harder

952
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:58,580
than you want it to.

953
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,920
If you have a dedicated Nvidia graphics like this thing does, it's not so bad.

954
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,200
Uh, but then like they, but they notice when they turn that Nvidia GPU on battery life goes

955
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,800
in half, half.

956
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,800
Oh, I believe it.

957
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,320
I'm not surprised by that at all, but you know, at the same time, it's like when it

958
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,840
comes to laptops or even desktops, to a certain extent, if you're someone that needs that,

959
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,240
you know, needs that, uh, you know, kind of quality, that's gotta be a larger consideration

960
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
in your overall experience.

961
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,840
But I think for Joe average, honestly, I think a decent keyboard, a decent battery and a,

962
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,560
and a display that is reasonably good and of course not being, not weighing a ton.

963
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
I think that's really what it comes down to most people.

964
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:40,120
I am, uh, waiting, uh, I am waiting to hear, uh, updates on the, uh, the, uh, Purism, uh,

965
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,120
Librem 15.

966
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,800
Uh, I, we now have the, uh, the boot screen.

967
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
I guess that's going to be the boots, uh, the boot screen right there.

968
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:50,880
There's just this nice white Purism, uh, logo, uh, so I, you know, it reached its funding

969
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,200
and they're still posting updates about the project.

970
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,440
And I think Noah's been checking in, checking in with them from time to time as well.

971
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,280
So, uh, it looks like when that ships, it's going to have an i7 in June.

972
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,980
The one will ship in April, one will ship in June and it's going to be pretty nice rig.

973
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,120
So hopefully we'll see.

974
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,440
I don't know if it's going to be the perfect Linux laptop, but the quest to find the perfect

975
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,920
Linux laptop, in my opinion, continues on.

976
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,360
So there's actually one thing that I don't know.

977
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:23,680
I really, I noticed that in the text on their campaign mentions an integrated, uh, Intel

978
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,960
car video card and in the video, they talk about the Nvidia one.

979
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,520
I don't know what's going on with that.

980
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,520
Are you talking about the Libra?

981
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,520
Yes.

982
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,520
The Purism.

983
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:33,520
Yeah.

984
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,520
Yeah.

985
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,520
It's going to have both.

986
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,520
Yeah.

987
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,160
It's going to have both because it's like in the text, it only says the Intel one.

988
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
Right.

989
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,680
I think, I think in our interview, I think in our interview with him, he said it would

990
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,800
have both if I recall correctly, because I tried to clarify that point.

991
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,800
If I recall.

992
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Okay.

993
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,800
Yeah.

994
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,920
Because it does look, it does look weird because for me, I was like, I was rechecking it and

995
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:02,080
then the text only mentions one of the cars, then in the video mentions the Nvidia.

996
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,080
It feels a little bit sketchy.

997
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,080
Yeah.

998
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,080
Yeah.

999
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,080
I don't know.

1000
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,080
Yeah.

1001
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,440
Uh, if somebody was, if you, if you want to, if you want to, you could check, you could,

1002
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,080
I think it is in that interview.

1003
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,080
Uh, yeah.

1004
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,080
All right.

1005
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,080
I'll rewatch it.

1006
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,400
I'm, I'm looking forward to, I hope mine's in the April batch, even if it, even if it

1007
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,320
doesn't mean, cause I really want to give it a review and, and, uh, I don't know, I still

1008
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,200
feel like the quest continues on the quest continues, just like the quest continues on

1009
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,200
to always better yourself.

1010
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,200
Doesn't it?

1011
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,640
And that's why our next sponsor is so perfect.

1012
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,640
That's Linux Academy.

1013
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:33,640
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash Linux.

1014
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,800
I believe that as our year old, no, I'm sorry, it's unplugged linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1015
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,800
You'd think I would know.

1016
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,440
Uh, the reason why I was a little distracted is I have the coolest note here that I wanted

1017
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,480
to read, uh, from, uh, a, uh, Linux unplugged audience member who heard about Linux Academy.

1018
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,960
So get started, keep this in mind, linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

1019
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,960
Go there to get started.

1020
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,160
You'll get our special 33% discount, which is really awesome.

1021
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,400
Uh, and Linux Academy is a great resource for you to learn more about the systems you're

1022
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,920
probably going to end up having to use, administer, be responsible for, or want to someday.

1023
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,680
Linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

1024
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,680
Go get started over there.

1025
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,960
I got an email in from Mike.

1026
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,360
He says, I just want to say thanks to the whole Jupiter broadcasting community.

1027
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,760
I wouldn't have known about Linux Academy if it wasn't for you guys.

1028
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,280
I was able to get my Linux plus certification and land my dream job as a Linux administrator

1029
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,000
for a hosting company.

1030
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,320
I went over to Linux Academy forums to thank them too and made sure they heard about it

1031
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,320
from you guys.

1032
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,040
They knew it was from you guys.

1033
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,220
Thanks again, Mike.

1034
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:30,160
And I get stories like that all the time.

1035
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,560
Linux Academy is set up by people who truly care about this stuff and really know the

1036
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,560
subject material.

1037
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,240
And so they devoted their entire site to it.

1038
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,280
They hyper focus in on this area and so that way they super serve you.

1039
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,620
You know why that makes the difference.

1040
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,700
If you're a Linux enthusiast, you know how much it makes a difference when the people

1041
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,200
behind it care and use Linux and open source.

1042
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,160
They have step-by-step video courses, downloadable comprehensive study guides, and it's never

1043
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,280
been a better time to join Linux Academy because they have a huge announcement coming very

1044
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,280
soon.

1045
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,560
On April 16th, they're going to have a live show at 9 PM central time where they're going

1046
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,480
to make some of their biggest content announcements ever over there.

1047
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,240
You're going to want to go check that out.

1048
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,640
Also, they've got some great news if you're going in for one of the LPI, like the LPIC

1049
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,440
one exam or Linux plus.

1050
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,640
They are now CompTIA approved quality content, which means you can go take the study lessons

1051
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,040
from Linux Academy and then just go get your certification.

1052
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,720
You can do this from the comfort of your own home.

1053
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:25,480
What's really nice about that is Linux Academy will just let you get all that material offline.

1054
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,040
You can listen to the courseware like when you're commuting.

1055
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,460
You can set how much availability you have and it will automatically create courseware

1056
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,940
for you that matches that.

1057
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,480
You can get step-by-step.

1058
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,480
This is where you're at percentage-wise.

1059
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,280
You can see I have this much time for this area.

1060
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,360
Then it's going to take me this long to move on to here and you can do quizzes to check

1061
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,360
yourself.

1062
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,520
There are seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from and the courseware all

1063
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
matches that.

1064
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,520
So does the virtual labs.

1065
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,520
They spin up automatically.

1066
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,200
It's just such a cool system and you're really going to be impressed with the stuff they

1067
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,520
announced on the 16th.

1068
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,520
Go to linuxacademy.com.

1069
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,120
Get our special 33% discount and go check them out.

1070
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,120
It's a great time.

1071
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:04,120
I love that you're going to get that 33% discount right now when they're just about to make

1072
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,120
the service even better.

1073
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,040
It's just such a cool opportunity.

1074
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,040
Linuxacademy.com.

1075
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:16,920
Something really nerdy happened this week and too bad Alan missed his opportunity to

1076
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,320
bash ButterFS and sing the praises of ZFS.

1077
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,320
Aw shame.

1078
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,240
Too bad he had to leave early.

1079
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,220
Well there was actually a pretty big developers conference going on talking about the future

1080
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,220
of Linux storage.

1081
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,220
Oh I know.

1082
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,800
So exciting right?

1083
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,560
Well it turns out maybe things are going to look up for good old ButterFS.

1084
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,840
So let's dive in right into that because I think that's the piece that's the most relevant

1085
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,400
to our audience because we all want to see ButterFS succeed but we all know it's got

1086
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,640
a little bit of room.

1087
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,480
So Chris Mason, he's a Facebook software engineer.

1088
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,040
We've talked about him before.

1089
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,800
He's one of the ButterFS maintainers.

1090
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,960
He explained how Facebook uses ButterFS.

1091
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,220
ButterFS has many advantages of file systems such as the ability to handle both numerous

1092
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:03,600
small files and single files as large as six exabytes, a baked in RAID, built in file system

1093
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,980
compression and integrated multi-storage device support.

1094
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,040
Facebook of course runs on Linux.

1095
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,640
To be exact Facebook runs the 3.10 and 3.18 Linux kernels on an internal distribution

1096
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,440
which is based on CentOS.

1097
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,420
For Facebook the real win is that ButterFS is stable and fast under an endless input

1098
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:27,080
output operation per second, you know IOPS, pounding from Facebook's constantly updating

1099
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,160
users.

1100
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,160
That's good news.

1101
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,560
The bad news is ButterFS is still way too slow for traditional databases such as Maya

1102
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,560
SQL.

1103
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:39,440
For those systems Facebook is still using XFS, which I thought that was kind of interesting.

1104
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,460
To coordinate the two file systems Facebook uses Gluster, the open source distributed

1105
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,000
file system.

1106
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,040
This is all kind of some good details we're getting here.

1107
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,920
Facebook which works hand in glove with upstream ButterFS Linux kernel developers is working

1108
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,600
on improving ButterFS's database speed.

1109
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,400
Kind of neat.

1110
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,400
That is interesting.

1111
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,000
It's like it's one of those things to where, you know, I think a lot of people go to these

1112
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,400
social sites and they just see everything, well, if it's Facebook, you know, whether

1113
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,400
it works or not is kind of hit and miss, but most social sites work pretty well for the

1114
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,400
most part.

1115
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,980
And it's interesting to see what they're choosing and, you know, how that's going forward and

1116
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,600
where ButterFS fits into the whole thing.

1117
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,520
It's going to be fascinating to see where things go two, three years from now.

1118
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:25,560
It gives me, you know, I'm not a big fan of Facebook, but I'm kind of glad that they have

1119
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,960
a bit of their horse hitched to that wagon.

1120
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,200
Is that the right, am I using that right?

1121
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:35,040
I think so, but I would definitely agree that it's not like attending the Federation Council

1122
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,320
or something when you go to Facebook.

1123
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,680
It's pretty, the culture is definitely a little different.

1124
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,920
The fact that, so the way that Facebook is approaching this is they seem to have identified

1125
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,760
ButterFS as a critical piece of Linux technology.

1126
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,120
So they hire one of the guys that works on it and that's his job and he interfaces directly

1127
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,840
with the Linux kernel team and it's a pretty ideal situation.

1128
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:58,280
So it seems like it's pretty important to them and in that case that means ButterFS

1129
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:02,360
probably has a pretty good shot of having long-term funding and longevity of development

1130
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,920
behind it, which I think is pretty important.

1131
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,160
I think it's extremely important.

1132
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,160
Yeah.

1133
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,600
Derek Dublin, you had a point about their upstream give back?

1134
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,600
Yeah.

1135
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:16,820
They've actually been very keen on trying to get things to the open source community

1136
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,080
back like as fast as possible.

1137
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:23,200
I can give you the example of HHVM and their programming language.

1138
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,360
They actually went immediately to the Debian folks and opened an ITP, which is intended

1139
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:35,460
to package requests and they've been working directly with Debian maintainers to get that

1140
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,840
across and spread through there.

1141
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:45,240
It's like they hired doing an effort and most of the times I see an actual, you know, just

1142
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,360
not put the project out and not maintain it.

1143
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:54,440
They actually continuously support the project and do an effort to make it lend to the community

1144
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,840
back as soon as possible.

1145
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,600
I think that's a good part of that.

1146
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,560
That is really cool to hear actually.

1147
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,560
That's good to know.

1148
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:09,440
Before we wrap up, has anybody else noticed all the attention the Ubuntu Mate project

1149
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,440
gets these days?

1150
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,440
Oh yeah.

1151
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,440
Yes.

1152
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,240
Have you been noticing this?

1153
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:20,320
Oh, so Wimpy makes a video about including Tilda or something like that.

1154
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,840
Wimpy announces that Ubuntu Mate 1504 will have Tilda, a very nice drop-down menu and

1155
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,000
Wimpy made a very great video that sort of explains the rationale of how he came to use

1156
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,320
it and why, which maybe we can repeat here in just a sec.

1157
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,920
But next thing I know, I'm seeing it on three or four or five Linux news websites.

1158
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,080
Wimpy, you have a bit of a sensation on your hands here.

1159
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,080
Yeah.

1160
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,080
How did that happen?

1161
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,080
I don't know.

1162
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,480
I think it's great.

1163
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,600
So tell us about Tilda.

1164
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,640
Yeah, everyone's really keen on such a simple feature.

1165
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,520
I was very surprised by it.

1166
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:57,560
You know what, I've heard you mention it before, but I liked your rationale and how you came

1167
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,760
to use it and why it's sticking in the distro.

1168
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,760
Yeah.

1169
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:08,840
So when I was working on the Compiz integration and I kept breaking Compiz, you're left without

1170
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,440
window decorators, so you're kind of stuffed.

1171
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:20,440
So I installed Tilda as my get out jail free card, so every time I broke Compiz, I could

1172
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:27,360
just F12, reset Compiz, start Marco and get my session back up and running again.

1173
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:33,840
So whilst I was dev-ing Compiz, that was my safety net and I got so accustomed to using

1174
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,000
it, I started using it for other things and I thought, you know what, this is actually

1175
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,200
kind of useful, so I'm going to leave it in.

1176
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,840
That's how it came to be in the distro.

1177
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:47,680
And so why Tilda over, say, like Guake, because Guake's always what I use.

1178
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,680
Yeah.

1179
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:54,760
Well, I tried both, but Tilda runs in about five megs of RAM and Guake runs in about 25

1180
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:00,300
to 30 megs of RAM, so if I want something that I'm leaving in that's turned on by default,

1181
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:05,640
I don't want it to be too large because most, well I'll say most, there's a good number

1182
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,720
of people running Ubuntu Mate on resource constrained hardware so I didn't want to bloat

1183
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,720
it out unnecessarily.

1184
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:12,720
Of course.

1185
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,080
They really appreciate that, I'm sure.

1186
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:20,960
You know, I think what it is is, and this is what I have ragged on Canonical for taking

1187
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:26,420
a little focus off the desktop for the last couple of years, is what I believe and what

1188
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:31,840
you're doing with Ubuntu Mate may be proving this out, is the Ubuntu desktop got really

1189
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:36,940
close, really close to the goal line, and what you're doing by like adding things like

1190
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:44,560
sensible compass integration, the Tilda integration, but also like the folder color stuff.

1191
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,740
Just these little, it's not the final 10%, that's not the right way to put it, but these

1192
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:54,200
closing the gaps that adds these little things like, when I saw you and started including

1193
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,560
folder color, I thought, you know what, I should probably install folder color, I want

1194
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:01,060
folder color, like that sounds like something I would, just a nice little visual indicator.

1195
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:04,440
And it's these little things that you're just sort of polishing off and adding a little

1196
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,960
bit here and there to this traditional desktop paradigm, and I think people are recognizing

1197
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,960
that.

1198
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,240
Plus, let's be honest, Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 14.10 are decent platforms for people to distribute

1199
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,240
applications on, so there's some excitement there.

1200
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,080
And you guys are polishing off these little edges here and adding these nice little touches.

1201
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,400
I think that's why people are getting excited about it.

1202
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,680
Well, thank you very much.

1203
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,600
And whilst you've mentioned folder color, the developer of folder color has been working

1204
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:37,880
on a new version, which now supports Numix icon themes, and also has a facility where

1205
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:43,200
if you want to change the default color for all of your icons, so effectively theme your

1206
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,840
icons, you can now do that as well.

1207
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,540
So whether or not that lands for 15.04, we'll have to see.

1208
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:54,520
There's a feature freeze exception filed for that, but hopefully that'll make it in time.

1209
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,320
If not, it'll be in 15.10.

1210
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,320
Cool.

1211
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:02,360
And something I've been following is the... I know you have a lot of places you distribute

1212
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,360
info.

1213
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,500
Maybe this isn't even the best one, but one I've been following is the Google Plus community.

1214
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,760
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

1215
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,320
Everything somehow makes it to the Google Plus, so yeah, that's probably the best place

1216
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,320
to follow.

1217
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:22,560
And if not there, then the actual Ubuntu Marte community where there's some deeper discussion

1218
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:27,200
with some of the community members that if you want to get the skinny on the Raspberry

1219
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:34,760
Pi 2 development and the Odroid C1 development, that's all happening in the Ubuntu Marte community.

1220
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,760
Very good.

1221
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,760
And you know what?

1222
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,760
I actually had an email in about that.

1223
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,760
So thank you.

1224
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,760
So that's a good place to go to.

1225
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,760
Yeah.

1226
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:49,600
You know, I've been running the version of Ubuntu Marte based on 14.04 here as my Skype

1227
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:54,240
and Mama machine now for weeks, and it's just been rock solid.

1228
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,240
So I love it.

1229
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,120
I think it's a great... I think it's a great distro.

1230
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:02,380
Well, it's been... I'll tell you, it's been... the more I use it, the more I become married

1231
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,380
to it.

1232
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:07,700
I just... it's because I'm finding that I'm not having to screw with the stuff I was having

1233
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:08,700
to screw with before with other distributions.

1234
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:09,700
Yeah.

1235
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,700
You're just using the computer now.

1236
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:11,700
Yeah.

1237
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,700
Crazy thought, right?

1238
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,700
I could actually get my work done.

1239
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,460
And like what he mentioned with Tilda, I actually installed it after he mentioned it the first

1240
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,560
time before I even... I was just like, oh, this is sweet.

1241
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,560
Yeah.

1242
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,000
I got a low resource machine.

1243
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
This is fantastic.

1244
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Yeah.

1245
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Yeah.

1246
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I thought it was pretty good.

1247
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
All right.

1248
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,360
Well, so we'll wrap it up there.

1249
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,720
And I have so much more I could talk about in regards to watches.

1250
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,280
I feel like I could talk about watches for some reason for like a whole episode, but

1251
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,120
I'm saving all of you the burden of having to listen to me go on and on about my Pebble

1252
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,120
Watch.

1253
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:44,080
However, I will mention I installed a couple of really cool apps.

1254
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,200
If you've got a Pebble Watch, go get the... let's see, where is it?

1255
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,460
And I assume you also have Lollipop.

1256
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:55,240
On 11, we'll sync your steps to Google Fit so you can track your fit stuff with Google

1257
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,380
from your Pebble.

1258
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:01,180
And also there's a really great sleep app called... I think it's just called Android

1259
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,960
Sleep or something like that that works with the Pebble to track your sleep.

1260
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,800
There's a real... I'm having a lot of fun with the Pebble, Matt.

1261
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,800
I'm just going to... I'll just leave it at that.

1262
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:08,800
Very, very cool.

1263
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,800
I'll just leave it at that.

1264
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,520
I won't bore everybody else to tears with all of the details.

1265
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,520
I'm sorry.

1266
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,480
Hey, watchers are cool.

1267
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,200
I used to have one with a calculator on it.

1268
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,760
It dates me a little bit, but that's okay.

1269
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,760
No, it's the new thing.

1270
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:20,760
It's back.

1271
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,760
The new thing is the old thing.

1272
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,760
Right.

1273
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,760
Right.

1274
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,440
Matt, wouldn't it be nice if we had everybody join us next week?

1275
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,040
Now, I know Daylight Savings has been a bit of an issue, but we do the Unplugged Show

1276
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:34,240
on Tuesdays at 2 PM Pacific, and you can go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

1277
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,640
to get that converted to your local time zone.

1278
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,640
You go to jblive.tv.

1279
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,980
We've got the chatroom embedded.

1280
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,120
You can join our open Mumble Room.

1281
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,660
We just check your mic, and you can comment on the stories, so we really would love to

1282
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,660
have you join us.

1283
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:45,960
Hey, Matt, have a great week, and I'll talk to you next Tuesday, okay?

1284
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,960
All right.

1285
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,960
All right, everybody.

1286
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,720
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Lettings Unplugged.

1287
01:00:49,720 --> 01:01:19,000
We'll see you right back here next week.

1288
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:28,000
Oh, I'm glad Daylight Savings worked out for you, Hume.

1289
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,720
You're the one audience member, I think, that hasn't been messed up by it.

1290
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,040
Yeah, Sleep as Android.

1291
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,120
Thank you, micro89.

1292
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,120
That's the app.

1293
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:38,400
It's really cool because Sleep as Android, if you have any sleep issues, it's really

1294
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:44,760
a good troubleshooting application because it uses the accelerometer in the Nexus.

1295
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,360
It uses the microphone to monitor noise in the room, and then it uses the accelerometer

1296
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:54,440
in the Pebble to detect any movement, and it combines all of that data together, so

1297
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:59,280
if I move and my Pebble tracks that, it will then at the same time correlate that to any

1298
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,200
room noise, and it'll show a waveform spike of any noise in the room, so I can listen

1299
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:07,880
to somebody rip an ass or snore or whatever it is, and then it'll also give me my total

1300
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,960
time of REM sleep.

1301
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,960
That is extremely useful for me because that's what I'm troubleshooting right now because

1302
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:21,440
I go to bed at a decent time, but if I go to bed, say, at 10.30 and I wake up at midnight

1303
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:26,080
versus I wake up at, say, five in the morning, I feel exactly the same either way.

1304
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,760
It feels like I got the same amount of sleep, so I know there's something that's not right

1305
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,080
there, so I'm trying to troubleshoot how much sleep I'm actually getting at night, like

1306
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:39,300
how much good sleep, and that, according to the Pebble, is last night I actually got two

1307
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,300
hours of sleep.

1308
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:46,640
Chris, I've got a little tip for you because I got bitten in the ass by it this morning.

1309
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,640
All right.

1310
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:54,920
It's Sync, not Sync thing, BitSync again, so I went around and updated a couple of my

1311
01:02:54,920 --> 01:03:00,360
boxes this morning, and BitSync 1.4 got replaced with BitSync 2.0.

1312
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,160
It is, I was wondering if they were going to replace it.

1313
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:10,280
Okay, right, well, I don't know what OS you're running on, but in the AUR, there's a BTU

1314
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:19,400
T-Sync 1.4 package, and the guy that makes the Ubuntu packages in his Debian repository,

1315
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:24,640
he's got a repository that is specifically pinned to the 1.4 version, so I've gone around

1316
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,640
and...

1317
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,640
And so it begins.

1318
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,920
So now there's essentially a 1.4, so I have to go uninstall BitTorrent Sync and install

1319
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,020
this 1.4 version.

1320
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,040
Have you upgraded to 2.0 yet?

1321
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,040
No.

1322
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,040
No.

1323
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:44,920
On the machines that I haven't upgraded to 2.0, I just installed the 1.4 version, and

1324
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:45,920
that's fine.

1325
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,880
It just replaces the 1.4 version that I'm already running.

1326
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,560
So I just did an upgrade last night.

1327
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,880
Do you think I might have to check?

1328
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:54,880
I don't know.

1329
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,400
Yeah, so there is a guide on the btsync2.0 help center.

1330
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:06,300
There is a guide on how to roll back to 1.4, and you are going to want to do this because

1331
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:12,240
btsync2.0 is not 1.4 out of beta.

1332
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:17,000
It's a completely different product, and it works in a completely different way, and it

1333
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:24,440
will not suit your use case of handing out a key that multiple people can then snag.

1334
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:30,760
It's all designed about, these are my devices in my network, and I want to link them together.

1335
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:38,040
And with the btsync2.0 package, there's no way to create what they now call a classic

1336
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:42,160
share where you say, you know, make me some keys.

1337
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:46,280
You can only now create these device-linked shares in the 2.0 system.

1338
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,280
Oh no.

1339
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,280
Oh no.

1340
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,540
What am I going to do?

1341
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:52,740
Do what I did.

1342
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,380
You can roll back.

1343
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:56,880
It's fairly straightforward to roll back to 1.4.

1344
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,440
Yeah, but what are you going to do about security fixes in the future?

1345
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,080
Yeah, well, this is it.

1346
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:07,080
This is my holding position until I get cfile up and running.

1347
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:12,280
And how is cfile at distributing to large audiences files?

1348
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:16,880
You can share links via its web thing, but I haven't actually got around to testing that,

1349
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,840
so I can't say how well it will suit your use case.

1350
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:26,280
So basically, I should downgrade back to BitTorrent Sync 1.4, huh?

1351
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,720
Well, it depends.

1352
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:36,720
I mean, I'm going to because the way I'm using the product, I could probably go to 2.0, but

1353
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:42,840
I was really wary of the fact that I didn't realize that it worked in a different way.

1354
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:49,020
And suddenly, the two instances that I'd upgraded were no longer connected to one another.

1355
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:55,880
The old classic shares were still syncing, but in terms of how new shares would work,

1356
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,720
that was they weren't linked together.

1357
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:07,440
So I've rolled back so I can test BtSync 2.0 in its own installation in a VM somewhere

1358
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,800
just to see how it works and figure it all out before I either stick with it and pay

1359
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:17,440
my money and upgrade or move to something else and quite possibly I'm going to move

1360
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,920
to cfile.

1361
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:26,160
This is super unfortunate because I'll give you another use case.

1362
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:32,880
People have asked for a complete archive of the Linux action show, and there's not one

1363
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:38,080
spot you can go and get everything from episode one to episode 356 or whatever we're at.

1364
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,400
And part of that is because where do you store all that?

1365
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,800
But part of it is it's a lot of transfer, et cetera, et cetera.

1366
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,920
And one of the things we used BitTorrent Sync for was we started working on a collaborative

1367
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:52,560
effort where some people have personal archives where we have gaps missing.

1368
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:56,840
And we started all collaborating in one BitTorrent Sync folder, and I just gave them out the

1369
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,840
key on the subreddit.

1370
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,840
Yeah.

1371
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:05,440
I can't do anything like that with any other file services.

1372
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:14,440
So my advice is roll back to 1.4 as your holding position so you retain your existing behavior.

1373
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:22,880
Go and test 2.0 in its own VM that isn't linked in any way with your existing BT sync devices

1374
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,480
and see if it's going to continue to work for you.

1375
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:32,000
If you are running BT sync 2.0, say I'm one of your subscribers.

1376
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:40,360
If I'm running BT sync 2.0, I can paste classic share keys in, but you can't create them.

1377
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,360
Okay.

1378
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:44,680
So that's the other thing is I can't prevent the audience from upgrading.

1379
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:45,680
No.

1380
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,680
No.

1381
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,680
Yeah.

1382
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:48,680
This is screwed.

1383
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:49,680
This is so screwed.

1384
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:56,320
And I can't do like the other thing is there are like there are software packages out there

1385
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:02,600
that will automatically create like torrent feeds and all that kind of stuff, but it's

1386
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,600
not the same.

1387
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,160
It's not like a distributed content.

1388
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:08,200
It's just I should have seen it coming.

1389
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,280
I actually did see it coming.

1390
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,000
So I'm actually none of this none of this surprises me at all.

1391
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,320
I would not say I'm caught surprised by any of this.

1392
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:22,800
The only thing I'm surprised about is 1.4 was, you know, it's a beta and 2.0 is the,

1393
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,680
you know, the final product, but it's a completely different product.

1394
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,200
It works in a completely different way.

1395
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:34,600
So all of that beta testing we did, we weren't beta testing the product that has just been

1396
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,600
released.

1397
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,960
If you're using BT sync 2.0 now, you are a beta tester again because it's so fundamentally

1398
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:41,960
different.

1399
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:46,640
It can't have been, you know, tested at the scale that, you know, 1.4 was.

1400
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,640
Yeah.

1401
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:48,640
Hmm.

1402
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:49,640
C file.

1403
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,920
I wonder where I can go to download the latest version of 1.4.

1404
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:53,920
Right.

1405
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:54,920
Okay.

1406
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,880
Let me paste a link in the chat room.

1407
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:57,880
Yeah.

1408
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,640
I'm definitely gonna be looking into C file.

1409
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,640
That's for sure.

1410
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:07,280
I've never heard of what it would C file open source cloud storage for your teams and organizations

1411
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:08,600
organized files into libraries.

1412
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,080
Each library can be shared between users and into groups like library can also be selectively

1413
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,880
synced to any device, edit and comment on files online.

1414
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,480
Hey, uh, wimpy, can you comment on that part?

1415
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,760
Edit and comment on files online.

1416
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,560
Is that like collaborative editing?

1417
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:25,040
Uh, I haven't tested any of that stuff yet.

1418
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,040
I'm own.

1419
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:30,120
I'm really only interested in file sync and all.

1420
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:37,320
And what I've done so far is yeah, and all I've done so far is gone and read the documentation

1421
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,320
a couple of times.

1422
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:44,560
So I know what to do when I get the time to actually set up a server.

1423
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,080
Now why use a C file?

1424
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,920
What about sync thing?

1425
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,060
Um, I've used sync thing.

1426
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:58,580
It's not, um, it's not, even if you've only got, I've got maybe eight or nine devices

1427
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:04,820
that are in my sync network and just managing that number of devices with sync thing, having

1428
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:10,800
to keep exchanging the keys every which way is unmanageable.

1429
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,720
So it just doesn't scale.

1430
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,720
You know, if you've got two computers, it's great.

1431
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,720
If you've got four computers, it's tricky.

1432
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:21,520
And if you've got, you know, more than six, it starts to get really cumbersome.

1433
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,520
Hmm.

1434
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,520
Okay.

1435
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:30,440
I'm looking at a ccloud.cc, which is a online commercial version of a C file.

1436
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,800
And cause they, they just, cause I was just curious if I, I would probably roll my own,

1437
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:43,640
but this one uses Amazon web services for the backend storage, uh, uh, gross, uh, I'll

1438
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:56,640
play with it some more and we'll see what we get.
