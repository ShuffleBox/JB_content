1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
Oh

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:08,380
Man, I'm glad we got a head start on the show yesterday because I had the hugest time suck this morning. What was it?

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,960
So my dad very nicely for my birthday got me the let me look these things up. Have you seen the Logitech?

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,420
Harmony, are you familiar with you're familiar with Harmony remotes, right?

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,180
They like the the big remote that like oh, yes

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,400
And you can have like modes where it turns on your your your receiver and it turns on your sound bar

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,480
And it turns on your sub and it turns on your DVD player turns on your TV and changes the input to the DVD player

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,480
Or blu-ray, right? It's these very functional

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,640
It's a poor man's echo. No, I guess it kind of it was a little bit in some ways, wasn't it?

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,800
Wasn't it? Well, it's funny you say that so the

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,480
The harmony this is the latest and greatest in this and it's this is a hub

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,520
That has like a thousand irs blasters that it shoots out everywhere plus has a little

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,560
remote IR blasters that you can set up in your home a little naughty and they recently

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,640
announced echo support

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,000
So you could use this as the intermediate hardware between your echo and your televisions pretty neat

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,960
So you can say things like echo turn on the TV turn off the TV turn on the sound bar things like that

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,880
And so that anything it can control with IR you've suddenly got access. Yes

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,680
So then Chris got very interested in this hub

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,440
So it's so if you're curious so far, this is a logitech harmony hub

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,160
And you could all have to have if you're a masochist and just want to use your smartphone to control all the things

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,880
You could also use this

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,480
With your smartphone and it just it looks like this

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,640
It's a little unoffensive puck and what's nice about this particular puck is the entire the entire

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,280
Surface and all of the edges is made of IR blasters

25
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,280
So it just shoots off IR in like every direction

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,920
Which is very nice for getting to a lot of your devices and then it comes

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,880
With in the box one additional I remote IR blaster that you can set up

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,240
Yeah, it looks like the remote is kind of an optional thing

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,480
So you can buy the hub on its own for like 90 bucks, right?

30
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,280
Which MSRP from logitech or you can go up with like the touchscreen remotes and stuff

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,360
So this pushed enough of my buns I was like interesting but not enough that I was gonna spend my own money

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,840
But my dad said hey, I'd like to get you a birthday present back in January. All right

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,920
Well, this would be something I wouldn't buy for myself, but I'd like to try so good old dad

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,480
He did he got me one of these and I have I just left in the box since January because you know

35
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,280
I'm not like super excited about this. I'm curious about this. And so I thought well today will be the day

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,080
How long could this take?

37
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,880
I've got a half hour. You've set up things with the echo before I'm actually I'm kind of in a groove, right?

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,640
Because I've been setting up TP link power adapters and Belkin white Wiimos or whatever they are

39
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,440
Like I've been in a groove recently. So I'm like, yeah, you know what I can bust this out

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Um

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,320
Dear God, this was literally one of the most brutal setups I've ever done in my life. It is so bad

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,320
So first of all it expect it

43
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,040
scans your whole network and tries to find anything that it thinks it might be able to pair with Bluetooth devices Wi-Fi devices and

44
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,040
So if you have multiples of any device, it course isn't very good at differentiating them

45
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,700
So I have two Nvidia shields in the RV. So it just has shield one shield two

46
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,360
I have no idea which one is is which then after it detects everything it it it

47
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,880
Calculates activities for me automatically like playing games and listening to music and then tries to create these dramatic

48
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,160
Formulas that you have to then go edit in this really awful app

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,900
So I spent 45 minutes fighting with the app trying to figure out how I could go in and change those. Yes

50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,200
It was rough because I really all I want is turn on my TV turn on my soundbar wake up the shield

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,840
Well, you don't need like the whole I don't I'm in my theater right turn it on now it by default

52
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,440
It wants to turn on the TV select the input for me then turn on the soundbar select the input on the soundbar like I

53
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,360
Don't want any of that

54
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,760
I just want you to and then it's then after that point it assumes you're gonna use it as the actual remote for the television

55
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,420
And I don't want any of that and it and then it's just it's it's

56
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,600
Compounded because anytime you go through the app to change the setting it

57
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,560
Automatically plays a woman's voice over tutorial in the background

58
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,320
So you get to points where you start hearing the same thing over and over again, but they don't cash it locally

59
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,360
So if you're on a my fight connection, you're just you sit there wait

60
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,500
Voice in the rest of the UI does not respond until the voice overloads off of the internet every single time

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,800
So that's literally one of the worst things ever

62
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,680
Really awful Wow like nails in the eyeballs awful waiting for that every single time. This is the only way to configure it eyes

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,600
Yeah, yeah

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,640
Well, actually there's one more which I'll be getting to but I managed to get through all of this eventually and it's bad

65
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:39,020
And oh my and dear lord help yourself if you don't correctly put in the device. So I have a continue us TV

66
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,480
which is I

67
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Silly me did continue with co co and ITU space us. Okay

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,460
That's no good. No, it's dot us not period like the ASCII dot

69
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,600
So you have to get on your mobile phone you have to put the ASCII dot in between continue and us

70
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,260
Which I just put a dash in there the first time I try to space

71
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,120
And it's a smart little device here, right?

72
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,060
Yeah, and then and then you have to get the model number just right which thank goodness. I scanned the RV

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,520
Manuals and paperwork so I was able to pull that up and that up because otherwise it's under the mount for the for the television

74
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,320
Ah, yep, you know, it's like yeah get it off the back your television. It's on a mount

75
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,880
I can't I'm not gonna unmount my television to get the model number so that so you got I go through all of this

76
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,200
Finally get it turning on the television and turning on the soundbar, which is all I want after an hour

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,480
Which is just I was I just I'm like, okay. I've got to go but now that I've gone this far. I

78
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,280
Must make sure it works with the echo

79
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,560
Otherwise what the hell was the point of all of this because I'm trying to set up a system

80
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,200
Where Hedia or the kids or myself can say echo?

81
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,880
Turn on the television and it turns on the soundbar and it turns on the TV and the soundbar is particularly hard to turn on

82
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,280
You have to get that remote in just the right spot

83
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,880
That's kind of tricky for like, you know four-year-old or three-year-old or five interest point six-year-old seven-year-old eight-year-old, you know

84
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,120
They're they're good, but they're not like they don't know the fact that there's this little IR surface on this

85
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,880
Otherwise large soundbar that you have to hit just right and those are exactly the kind of things you don't want your users to have

86
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,640
To know anything right and and if they wake up super early and they want to watch Steven Universe

87
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,280
Why come get dad at 5 a.m

88
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:27,680
When you know, so they can just say echo turn on the TV and then they can say echo start plex echo play Steven Universe

89
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,080
And it all happens automatically, but you have to have this device to make it all work

90
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,680
This is the grand vision after all Starship Enterprise on lady tubes

91
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,880
So I finally get it online. I finally get it controlling the devices. I

92
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,120
Go to scan the network with the echo. It doesn't see the Harmony Hub

93
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
So I you know, I'm looking up stuff

94
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:55,040
Okay, I have to have this particular version of the firmware on the Harmony Hub to be compatible with Alexa cancel. So

95
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,160
Sure enough that firmware the newest firmware or is it like one newest the absolute newest and I'm one release behind one release behind

96
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,960
But the real gotcha is how you update it now

97
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,920
I don't know if this is the only I don't know if this is the only way and I think it might not be

98
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,920
But at this point, I don't never use this thing. So I'm going purely off their documentation, right?

99
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,840
I just don't know what else to do and I don't really have the even the patience to Google it even further

100
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,220
But this is where Google has gotten me so far. It's a Logitech documentation

101
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,220
Download this DMG file to your computer. It says

102
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,400
Well, I'm on arch so I got to close all my stuff

103
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,520
I got a log out of slack where we're talking, you know planning the show

104
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,560
At least you can do this because you're on your yeah

105
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,080
Yeah, and I reboot in into Final Cut OS and I then I have to go back to that webpage through my same Google search

106
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,260
Hierarchy that I went through to get there because of course I didn't bookmark it and then I download the dumb DMG and I open

107
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,580
Up the installer and I run it and at the end the installer says the installation is finished

108
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,320
Would you like to move the installer to the trash? Yeah, okay fine

109
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,800
Then it gets in some sort of loop where it can't delete itself because the process is active

110
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,720
But then it wants to so after I just force close all of that

111
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,000
I I then have to this is such a crazy thing on the Mac

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,720
I don't I don't think people think about this if you because you know

113
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,360
I dip into the Mac OS to go do something like Jesus. This is how you do it

114
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,520
So after you use an installer because you're supposed to click and drag software on the Mac to install it like back in my old

115
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,780
Mac OS days, this is how you did it and a lot of people still distribute software that way, especially under DMGs

116
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,400
Yeah, sure, but not Logitech

117
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,420
No Logitech distributed an installer file which just dropped an application somewhere on my hard drive

118
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,860
But there's there's not like there's a menu entry that's updated

119
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:46,220
There's there's I don't know what name to invoke in Spotify search. It's not in the applications folder. What are you gonna do?

120
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,940
That's the whole thing. No, it's worse. Even if it's in the applications folder, what's it called? Yeah

121
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,260
What's the name of the app?

122
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,100
There's no way to know on the Mac and even if you sort by modified date

123
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,140
You don't get the right date because they've decompressed it from a file system image and they've copied to your file system

124
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,940
They preserve date and time so I can't even sort by modified time to find what the new application is

125
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,660
I don't know how Mac users do it. And so then I figure out well, okay, it's harmony something. So H. Nope

126
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,380
That's not there. Okay, Logitech L. Nope, not that's not there. Oh, they've called it my harmony

127
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,580
Now the app on the phone just called harmony, but of course on the computer, it's my heart a little more personal there

128
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,440
So I double-click my harmony dot app and yes, of course

129
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,940
It's not signed and then I'm greeted with before I can proceed to update the firmware on my hub

130
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,740
I'm greeted with the prompt to upgrade Silverlight

131
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:40,860
It's a Silverlight application. What it's a silver light. What? Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. I say to myself fine

132
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,020
All right, you're on the frontiers of the digital world here

133
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,100
We're gonna press on and skip the Silverlight update and see if this thing works

134
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,580
So then I go to update the firmware and they've got this big button on the side

135
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,780
That says this big Silverlight pulsing button that says upgrade your harmony. I'm like

136
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,280
And I'm reading the website too, and I just double-checked the documentation

137
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,180
Documentation says click to upgrade your harmony button

138
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,440
To update the firmware, right?

139
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
so I click that button and

140
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,120
It takes me to a screen where it wants to upsell me on additional devices for my harmony with no firmware update

141
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm like what so I go back to the documentation and I kid you not it says or

142
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,220
If after you click upgrade harmony, you don't get an upgrade click the sync button up in the right corner. What?

143
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,460
Sync button to update my firmware. Okay, so I click the sync button and it starts sinking mice

144
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,460
Well first it asked me if I want to log into logitech harmony and either use Facebook or Google to do it

145
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,620
Oh, yeah, great. Okay. So here you go. Click my Google thing now Google's got this too

146
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,700
They had it all don't worry sinks it starts syncing with the logitech servers sink and what you might ask

147
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,980
Well, apparently the first thing it sinks is the new firmware. So that's great. Although you don't really know this

148
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,340
It just says sinking and ever since upgrading firmware

149
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,460
So you don't really know it's doing that and then it syncs with the new firmware

150
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,900
And then it syncs all of your settings to the logitech servers and by sync all of my settings

151
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,260
It pulls down all of the wrong settings that I had just fixed on the damn thing before I decided to update

152
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,180
And refer to one revision back where nothing works

153
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,500
Even has the wrong TV model in there gets the new firmware breaks all my activities

154
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:19,580
So then I have to go through the activities app another brutal time to get the activities updated plug it back in and now it's all

155
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,580
working

156
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,340
Forty-five half way through I thought about it, but I just didn't want to give up

157
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,660
Yeah, I didn't want to give up and now now I'm there now. I've got it. So just never touch it again

158
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,180
Yeah, now I'm gonna go down the road and the IR blaster is gonna come off the mountain that'll break it

159
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,460
But other than that, how do you like it now that it's working?

160
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,900
I've only I literally only had it working for five minutes and I just get here

161
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
So tonight will be the true test

162
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:52,700
This is Linux Unplugged episode 185 for February 21st 2017

163
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:03,980
Oh

164
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,780
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that is currently and presently

165
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,780
Bursting at the seams with good news. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes

166
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,980
Hello, you know as I am I am just

167
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,980
Thrilled with today's lineup

168
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,220
I I am really looking forward to a chat that you and I are about to have sort of right at the top of the

169
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,420
Show and then sort of at the end of the show just really great clip from Linus on

170
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,540
Reflected on 25 years of working on the Linux kernel

171
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,500
We have some great project updates some big new features coming to all of us

172
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,980
Linux users some great news from the elementary folks and a hardware device

173
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,540
and

174
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:48,420
It's already it's already exciting but the hardware device that if Noah heard about this

175
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,580
Well, it would blow his mind. In fact, we better not tell him in fact

176
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,240
I've tried to avoid telling him I stuck it and unplugged so that way he may he might have missed it, right?

177
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,580
Because he's busy right now. He's busy right now and and you know, that's just sort of the tip of the iceberg

178
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,780
That's just sort of the tip I could sit here and tell you all day what we're gonna be talking about

179
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:11,020
We got some we got some really good gnome stuff to get some great plasma stuff. Oh, but Wes

180
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,220
We're gonna start the show with a big news

181
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,060
Big news story coming from the folks over at cute and Nvidia

182
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,340
So before we can get ourselves mentally prepared something we have to do there is a there is a there's one duty

183
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,820
We must perform and that's bringing in and welcoming our virtual log time appropriate greetings mumble room

184
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:36,180
Oh, hello there. Well, hello. Hello. So gentlemen

185
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,940
Upon us today is a great show

186
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,500
We I am every single story I am so thrilled to talk about and this first one is is gonna be good for those of us

187
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,020
On Linux that want to do a little 3d modeling just something I like to do from time to time playing with 3d studios

188
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,380
Blender things like that that I don't know. I don't have any idea what I'm doing

189
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,500
It's like an adult version of The Sims, right?

190
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,380
It is exactly a great way to play and so of course other people will find other reasons to find this great

191
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,340
But Nvidia is open sourcing and contributing to cute the Nvidia Drive design studio

192
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,900
Which is a designer friendly 3d UI authoring system. Mmm

193
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,880
It's now released with the name cute 3d studio or QT 3d studio

194
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:21,860
Depending on your preparation the contribution consists of several hundred thousand lines of source code

195
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,660
It consists of a runtime component designer friendly tooling and cute integration

196
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,700
Wow, this allows us to bring state-of-the-art 3d tooling to the whole cute ecosystem

197
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,540
And they say it's complementary to existing technology

198
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,120
They have a video here doesn't say much in the video

199
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:41,940
But it shows you a little bit of what the tool does it looks and the video is 3d so oh it is

200
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,940
Oh, are you being honest?

201
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,780
YouTube does that actually

202
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,340
They have 3d video and they have the AR video and so I'm gonna now I'm gonna look Wes now

203
00:14:52,340 --> 00:15:00,620
Nah, oh a shame that looks like that looks like windows like when I guess that's an advantage of cute, right?

204
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,660
Yeah, you know also he's on a Wacom there. And did you see the news today that I think in kernel 411?

205
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,260
We're gonna have some specific Wacom tablet support latest gens of their tablet supported

206
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,680
It's great to see that continue

207
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:19,180
They've had good support do you or does anyone in the lug there know of an application on Linux where you could take?

208
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:25,580
Handwritten notes. I asked that because good question. I find my I find myself a pretty forgetful man

209
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,540
But if I write something down, I almost never even need to look at it again. There's something about the active

210
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,220
Yeah, you've got two notebooks. You literally have your laptop propped up on two notebooks

211
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,260
You have two different notebooks with you right now. Wow. So you probably do find it useful to write things

212
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,380
Yeah, I really I really enjoy using the written word

213
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,100
But ultimately I end up wanting it on a computer ranks. I want to search it

214
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,580
Maybe I won't tag that maybe I just want to archive it and I don't want paper

215
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,060
I was just telling you about how I was able to look up the model number of my TV because I have a system

216
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,940
I can go back and search for documents for the RV same thing

217
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,020
so I was really wondering if you or anybody in the virtual lug there knows of a

218
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,900
System in Linux where if you have an input device like a pen input device, maybe it's a tablet

219
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,120
Maybe it's you know on a touch screen or a Wacom or yeah

220
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,300
Is there any is there any note-taking application on Linux that accepts handwriting not necessarily recognizes it even would be nice

221
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,140
I don't know. That's a good question

222
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,500
Bumble room. Not sure really

223
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:26,860
Yeah, I've heard of well if anybody out there listening knows I'd sure like to external external. Hmm

224
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,060
Yeah, I've used external. I've also used draw with

225
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,220
Just a draw pad cheap

226
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,460
When I bought off a mono price is you can just write on it and it will actually show up and draw so you can

227
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,460
Do notes of my boarding? Oh, this is

228
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:46,520
Why is it external or external because to be normal so people in the chat room are calling a zurnal or something

229
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,940
Which I'm gonna look it up right now. Yeah zurnal. Okay zurnal. Oh

230
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,580
Look at this

231
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,700
This looks old as F. Yeah, it hasn't been updated since 2014, but that's all right if it works if it works

232
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,820
Yeah, if I can if I can build it. Do you think it could be in there?

233
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,220
You are do you think it? Oh, let's try it live on there. Let's look right now

234
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,500
Embarrass ourselves. Let's find out. Let's find out if it's in the a you are it isn't hey you are. Let's see if it bills

235
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:17,460
Look at the guy in GTK 3. Oh my gosh. I'm gonna try to get GTK 3 version

236
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,000
Just because we'd like to live dangerous reasons

237
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,160
Because I mean that's probably the only thing that really needs updated on the thing if it works and then there was another suggestion too

238
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
right

239
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,140
Yeah, and look at that look at that it's installing right now

240
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,700
You are so much. That's why I can't leave you arch. I can't leave you. I can't how do you daddy?

241
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,320
How do you how do you daddy give that up? I don't know how do you get that up pretty hard so okay there you go

242
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:47,020
Okay, I'm gonna. I'm gonna play around if I this why you know the Wacom tablets are not crazy cheap

243
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:53,640
But I don't they are also very good devices, and I could probably use an editing too, so they have such nice Linux support

244
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,100
Yeah, well they then the one that I've been looking at which is the more reasonable priced one is gonna be in 411

245
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,620
Everything isn't there you are even plasma, so this is a great story

246
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,860
This could be a runs Linux if we were had recorded Linux action show this week

247
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,740
This is a good deployment of plasma desktops in the Australian schools now

248
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,740
I don't know how many of them total looks like 34 classrooms two counseling rooms some teacher rooms and some labs

249
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,620
It's not like all of that island over there

250
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:28,020
I think it's just just these but it's also 75 teachers that use it and 700 students

251
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,980
There's a lot of exposure here. Yeah, it's a great user base in fact

252
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,980
There's been some good bugs that have been found already in this user base and fixed I

253
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,580
Thought this was really good, so this was an interview with Thomas who helped set all of this up

254
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,420
He's the he's the guy over there that sort of I think pushed us because he's an open-source software enthusiast

255
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,940
He's a teacher. He's a web developer and a father, but not particularly any specific order

256
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,340
He says although I bet there is he says that at least 75 teachers are going to work within the system and most of the

257
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,180
7700 students will won't be on their computers these gonna be like computers just for the teachers

258
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,740
And this is an interesting kind of breakdown that they have

259
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,760
So first let me tell you about the hardware that I'll tell you about the way

260
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,620
They're breaking down the systems for usage because there's he likes two things about plasma for this one the customizability

261
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,340
Let's the students go crazy and the kiosk mode which prevents them from going crazy, so I'll tell you more about that

262
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:22,180
But here is the hardware first in some systems in some rooms. They have like old triple EPCs. It's rough, right?

263
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,820
Yep, so they've been able to switch to more powerful Acer laptops some with four some with eight gigs of RAM nice

264
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,700
That's goes a long way. Yeah, and you know in my ten-year-old Linux test that I did on that ten-year-old PC

265
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,060
Plasma desktop the latest plasma desktop ran just fine with four gigs of RAM

266
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,260
32-bit would be a little rough to hang on the distro

267
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,460
But one of our computer labs just got an upgrade with new HP desktops and big Samsung screens

268
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,900
Everyone loves those and he says everything works like a charm

269
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,980
They did have some problems mirroring the displays to a projector without losing configured widgets

270
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:57,180
But a bug was fixed in plasma 592. Thanks to Marco Martin, which I want to stop right there

271
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:02,460
I don't know if you've ever been in a deployment where you have end users where there's a bug in the software that prevents it

272
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,340
Working correctly for your users if it's a commercial desktop like Windows

273
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,580
Your only hope is to wait for the maybe a service pack if it's something like this

274
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,380
But most likely the next version of the Windows release which could be years away

275
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,780
And in this scenario he was able to submit a bug and work with Marco Martin

276
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
To get this thing have an opportunity like, you know

277
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,780
You can rely on the open source community

278
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,180
Yeah, if you have enough resources you can hire developer to try to fix it yourself

279
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,140
yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot there are options at all that is an unbelievable level of

280
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,820
Freedom that you I think when we talk about freedom, we don't consider that level of freedom and by the way

281
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,180
Yes, they're using KD neon. So they're getting those updates. They're getting those updates nice fairly quickly

282
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,620
So here's the breakdown

283
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,300
They bet on plasma because they made it just kind of out of the box

284
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,220
And it's also pretty easy to customize it to make it look like Windows 7

285
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:01,380
Which is really important for the acceptance of the teachers. I have experienced this myself to specifically having put Linux in labs before

286
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,980
Making it look more when this is one of the reasons why we eventually I think

287
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,060
Either it was either known to at the time or it was X FCE

288
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,860
I can't remember we ended up spending some time making it look like Windows to

289
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,180
To increase the acceptance by the teachers there

290
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,540
I was I was honestly shocked and I'm sure this isn't the case everywhere

291
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,700
but in our little podunk town here in Arlington, Washington, I

292
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,060
Was shocked at the resistance I got from people who are educators, you know, you think they're about

293
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,540
learning and and knowledge and

294
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,060
Analysis and they were it was it was pure rejection for change

295
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,940
Sake alone because they weren't necessarily happy with the Windows machines. They were having lots of problems, but they they didn't it wasn't a change

296
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,060
Yeah

297
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:50,180
But they're also probably kind of old right so change is hard for them in some cases. Yes. Yeah, and definitely yes

298
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,820
I definitely had teachers where it was the case where change was hard and there's only so much change they can do at a time

299
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,820
and that's just something that's like

300
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,700
Scope of teeth like teaching and all that stuff already consumes enough of them that changing their

301
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,140
Operating system isn't necessarily something they want. Yeah, it's like any busy people age was

302
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,420
Yeah age was commonly higher than those cases. But honestly anybody had the mindset. I'm too busy to handle what I already have now

303
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:16,180
I can't take anything else and that was off that could even that it was even sometimes some of the younger teachers

304
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,060
But yeah, I have some sympathy but yeah

305
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,380
I can kind of understand too

306
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,460
But you know at the same time

307
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,060
Like it was a huge problem for us time wise because they were constantly getting messed up

308
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,420
It was a big problem for them because they were constantly being taken out of order because they weren't working appropriately

309
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:37,340
So we needed something to change sometimes you have to change isn't it? So making it more windows-like was a huge acceptance factor

310
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,160
So I buy it here when he says they went with plasma because they can make it more like Windows 7 in some ways

311
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,020
So they hadn't heard about chillin. Yeah. Yeah. What was the name of it? Yeah. Yeah

312
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:51,000
So he says the first hour working with students is all about 3d effects custom fonts widgets and custom themes

313
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:58,420
After a half hour every single student desktop looks completely different and the students start to see it as their own system

314
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,780
Totally now that clicked with me for a second

315
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,420
Because you know Dylan his laptop

316
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,860
He took it on when when we are able to start changing things the way he liked it like it turns out when I gave it

317
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,860
To my like I had every app he would want to use in his dock

318
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,140
And put it like a special background on there. He didn't like any of that stuff

319
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,200
He only wanted one icon in his dock

320
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
He wanted he wanted a very specific

321
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,660
Minecraft background and then he really kind of took more he took a lot more ownership of it now

322
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,680
I thought this was interesting though in the classrooms. It's different

323
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,160
It's absolutely necessary that everyone leaves the computer in a usable state for the next teacher

324
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,200
So that's a reason the plasma shell was also picked because of the kiosk mode

325
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,880
He says he's had to you know work a lot of bugs out with the plasma developers

326
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
But they've done an amazing job fixing all the bugs

327
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,520
Since like five dot eight and above they say he says they now have a desktop that is completely launched to make sure nobody accidentally removes

328
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,480
Or reconfigures important parts of the user interface

329
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,760
And I honestly it my solution back in the day to solve that problem was I had a GDM

330
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,400
Logout script or a camera was log out or log in I think was log out script

331
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,600
that just deleted the home directory and then would copy over from like a a

332
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,240
default template directory I had

333
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,400
To do shared home directories basically like they're trying to just do isolated instances. Yeah

334
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,800
Well in my case we did we did network home directory so when the student would log in they'd get it mounted in their home

335
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,760
directory

336
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,640
and then when they would log out I would delete the home directory and then I would copy over a template directory that was

337
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,420
From a tar file that I could then SCP to the to the lab machines to give them a new desktop

338
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,600
I just SCP to new tar file and log out log in you get the new desktop nice

339
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,960
If you you have the whole home directory isolated per student right even matter

340
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,200
It shouldn't matter as soon as they log out it all gets cleared away

341
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,740
Yeah

342
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,400
And and one of the reasons we are able to do the run of the reason we went this route is in the labs

343
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,680
We just had a lab account and all of the students use the same lab account which you can imagine how awful that was under windows

344
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,040
Yeah, yeah, I had to go and of course here comes you know hotshot Chris

345
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,960
Well, we got to get user accounts set up. Everybody's got to have their own logins

346
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,740
Oh my god, you want to talk about resistant to change, you know, I was like, okay

347
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,040
These are the labs students want to come in that's fine

348
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,240
But then the same time we've got to have some way to wipe these things out and make them usable

349
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,220
It's probably a little easier today when like 90% of what they do is just gonna be in a web browser

350
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,980
Other things yes school stuff. Yes you back then it was a lot more it was GIMP. It was LibreOffice

351
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:23,200
there's a lot more stuff that students expected and flash and browser plugins all had to be just right and if you

352
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,260
Anything got monkeyed with it was a mess for the students

353
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,540
So that was a that was a different time and now kiosk mode sounds like it would do a lot of the work for me

354
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,640
So when I was in high school

355
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,500
We also had Linux which was pretty which was pretty but I think a lot of the a lot of the teachers had had Macs

356
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,540
Or I think a couple Windows machines as well. So it was a mixed environment, but all the labs were Linux. Yeah

357
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,940
Yeah, well you had a mixed environment. It was an old gnome 2, but you know it worked well

358
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,140
And that was a Firefox still the days of open office

359
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,620
I think just when it had started, but that was working pretty well Firefox. Yep Wow

360
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,140
University was still using gnome 2 two years ago

361
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,780
Good good times. I didn't you know I didn't know it was that I thought we were kind of a weird off

362
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,980
Cuz you know this is a while ago now. Yeah, totally. I thought we were a little bit of a weirdo

363
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,360
Well, it's interesting reflecting back because at the time like

364
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,700
Right as I was graduating I kind of got into it

365
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,460
I think so that was before you know I'd compiled a few C programs and play with the bouncy

366
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,000
It's like you want to play games when I should be studying right?

367
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,380
Yeah, but it really did work well, and I hope they're still doing I should check back in on them

368
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,340
Yeah, I mean I tell you I've told the story before the show, but the couple of times Linux

369
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:32,380
What first time I thought Linux was interesting and a really and I realized oh

370
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,900
This is a really powerful OS was when I accidentally RM RF a running system

371
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,260
By my workstation in my classroom totally and I was like jeez

372
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,280
I not only not only was I impressed that I could even do that and I there was no like I don't you had to do

373
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,980
Tactic there was no there was just you just it just did it

374
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:53,460
And then the other thing that I was amazed by is that it took me about five minutes to realize what happened because open office

375
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,700
And gnome just kept running you know cuz they're in memory

376
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,740
Yep, and it wasn't until I went to go do something that wasn't a memory that I was like oh

377
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,400
That's I think we've all seen that you're like and I was like okay

378
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,820
This is a really cool system, but I didn't really do anything with it after that

379
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,860
But then and then and I've told I won't go into it

380
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,500
But we use Linux a few times to really save the day of network wise

381
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:17,940
Just change things for us, and then I was like okay. This is this is really screw now where screw Windows NT

382
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:24,080
This is this is what I was smiling one more actually two more quick plasma things, and then we'll get going here

383
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,540
This was just kind of an interesting at this point technology experiment

384
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:34,300
It's too bad none of our canonical friends are here to tell us how great this is because I'm not particularly impressed

385
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,540
But it's it's a good first step. I'll put it that way

386
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,980
So we've talked a lot about flat packs and app images and snap packages

387
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,700
And it looks like Alex has taken the challenge of putting all of plasma in a snap

388
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,480
So one single snap and you get the entire plasma desktop pretty neat idea

389
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:59,060
But you know snap is still kind of new and so he ran into some really interesting things

390
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,940
So first of all distributing binary builds would be less of a hassle for them testing is more accessible

391
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,220
Can try them in in various ways can lessen the impact of security issues and confined software, so these are good things

392
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,280
reasons to consider distributing with snap format

393
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:18,260
But there's two main challenges that it breaks down to snap software is mounted and changing paths that are different from the installation directory and

394
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,540
Confining plasma is a bit tricky because of how many actors are involved in a plasma session

395
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,420
some of the medium far-reaching access to system services right as it turns out problem one in particular is

396
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,940
By is biting plasma fairly hard not exactly a great surprise

397
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:38,700
You know when you relocate and install plasma. It isn't exactly something that they normally do in the past so

398
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,300
they had to essentially go through and figure out what dependencies would break when the

399
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:49,380
Session move when the installation path moves and for one of them for example one of them is like ex-wayland things like that have

400
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,380
To be refigured out

401
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,740
But the other thing that I found to be more interesting and wondering if this isn't going to be a really bigger problem and sort

402
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,100
Of limit the potential for confined applications

403
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,620
Confining plasma as a whole is fairly straightforward albeit a bit of a drag since it's basically a matter of figuring out

404
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:11,580
What is or isn't required to make things fly a lot of the logouts and logins is just basically what it takes

405
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:18,500
Fortunately snaps have a built-in mechanism to expose deba session services offered by them a full-blown plasma session has an enormous

406
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:25,100
Amount of services it offers on debus from the general purpose notification service to special interest plasma activity services

407
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:32,580
Being able to expose them effectively is a great help in tweaking confinement to get plasma to start to work with confinement a bunch of holes

408
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,300
Need to be poked in confinement that are outside the scope of the existing interface

409
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,140
Kaywin in particular is taking the role of a fairly central service in the plasma wayland world

410
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,220
So it needs far-reaching access so we can do its job

411
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,500
Unfortunately interfaces currently can only be built with snap these source tree itself

412
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,980
So we had to make an example interface which covers most of the core services relevant

413
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:59,380
But unless you build snap D. It wouldn't be easy to try because you'd have to be building the latest version

414
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,620
so in summary

415
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,020
There's a lingering question of whether confining like this makes sense at all

416
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:11,300
Putting all plasma into the same snap means this one snap will need lots of permissions and interaction with the host system

417
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,940
At the same time it also means that keeping confinement profiles up to date would be a

418
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,460
Continuous task and feat as there are so many things offered and used by one step

419
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:27,420
so it may be that the things things like large desktop environments all

420
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,620
One snap not gonna be not it's not gonna be really possible to say here's the plasma snap

421
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,900
You're probably gonna have to break it up into smaller components like a Kaywin snap and right now

422
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,020
I do think it's always good like it's painful when you run into these things

423
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,660
But I feel like it's usually helpful when you are forced to sort of enumerate exactly what access your stuff requires

424
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,560
Especially as we become more security conscious great community

425
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,860
I know I see that a lot with like deployments and stuff where you're like, oh, yeah

426
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,620
Well, I require all these things and suddenly when you have to specify them you understand really what your requirements and dependent

427
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:03,980
It is always good to always be looking at what those are and re-asking and I know the switch to Wayland has has invite some

428
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,280
of that definitely

429
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:10,500
So let's one more plasma thing and I wanted to I wanted to pick up from where we left off last week with you

430
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,580
So during the show last week you switched over to the plasma desktop for that's right

431
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:20,940
And we've also got the state of plasma that was posted at net runner net runner dash mag comm

432
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,940
Which will have linked in the show notes

433
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,940
So I I kind of wanted to go over your experience cover his experience because I've been I've been

434
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,780
I've been so impressed with the plasma desktop specifically five nine

435
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:38,360
That I've had a hard time articulating what's wrong with it

436
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,800
people said so what's not working still and I'm having a hard time articulating it because I'm

437
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,440
I'm not like in review mode. I'm just like in use mode on like I'm just a geek out mode

438
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,760
and so I haven't really had to turn on that part of my brain until I started really getting this question more and more and

439
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,720
So now I've slipped into more review mode of the plasma desktop

440
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,800
And so I've I've got some observations of things that I think should be improved

441
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,640
But there's still not major things and so I'm curious to hear what your experience has been so far

442
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:12,080
I've been pretty impressed. I think it's been a year or two since I really had like plasma Katie anything as my main desktop

443
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,720
Some things I like like I already use quassel and other other cute applications

444
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,480
So it was nice to kind of have that be my native environment, but I have been approaching it very much like what you said

445
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,400
Just install and the defaults work

446
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,800
I was kind of interested in exploring with that because that's really what I do a lot of the time with gnome at least on

447
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,680
like this laptop which we

448
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,680
Refresh for the show a lot that kind of thing

449
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,980
So I really just kind of installed Katie start or plasma started working with it

450
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,460
it took me a while to like get used to some of the trivial things just like the

451
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,180
Like the mouse cursor is a little bit different plus some of the applications

452
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,340
I use like I have a lot of like

453
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:52,820
Telegram or slack they didn't integrate quite as nicely or look quite as nice with with just the default theme as I found that they

454
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,220
Did with home really, but I have not I have not customized that much

455
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,060
So I'm kind of interested to hear so another part that I I like I've been unit using unity at work

456
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:07,500
Mostly just because I got my desktop refreshed there haven't taken the time to customize that either because you know get work done

457
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,900
But I have been thinking about either installing gnome or plasma so now plasma is on the list

458
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,820
but like one of the things I think unity does well is

459
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,740
Imitate a tiling desktop or give me some of those features a lot of times really what I want and

460
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:24,500
Cinnamon does this well is just like quadrants even just splitting half their screens

461
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,860
But especially quadrants just gives me enough flexibility when I have multiple terminals open

462
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,820
Have you played it all with like the dragging the window and snapping it to an edge?

463
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,140
That's fine, but especially when I'm on a trackpad

464
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,780
I really want so like unity you can do I forget what I did like control out to you can do the quad

465
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,980
It works nicely

466
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:43,680
Cinnamon, I think is the best it does the pretty native little keyboard. Yeah, and they're really simple

467
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,020
Yes, and and no more so okay

468
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:50,100
You get the sides you can't do quadrants which frustrates me or at least not without like g tile or other things like that

469
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,300
I feel like keyboard commands. That is definitely something you could set up in the plasma. Yeah, so I would that's one of the areas

470
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:00,980
I'd be appreciate feedback because I'd like to figure out the best ways to kind of get those because with that I

471
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:07,100
I think it's very workable. I've been impressed for a while before I got all the KD you like wallet stuff set up, right?

472
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,900
Yeah, I would have problems where it's like I switch between you know and then chrome breaks

473
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,580
So that was kind of frustrating for a while. I got that working

474
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,620
Really everything else has been top-notch. It's been smooth. No crashes. I'm very impressed with Kaywin everything

475
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,100
So you know this you know yes

476
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,860
You do you notice like the way when like the dragging the windows it feels a little different than known yes

477
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,860
It definitely feels different. Yeah

478
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,060
Everything's like a little bit

479
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,060
Smoother or it feels like it

480
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,260
It has more effect in it, but not in this not in a slow way

481
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,260
I don't know the showy way not in a showy way showy and I also have turned the speed of mine up

482
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,620
One notch too. I've so they're a little bit faster on my system, but um

483
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:46,420
it does it in a way where it feels like a

484
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:53,060
Like a solid system. It feels solid it does feel solid so I would also say like on here

485
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,180
I'm running it with four gigs of RAM as well. It runs. Just right. No problem

486
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:01,900
I experienced my first two crashes today for the first time and they weren't major the first one was actually almost sort of pleasant

487
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,060
I know it's a funny thing to say but the the

488
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:10,660
Panel faded out my widgets faded out my background faded out faded to black for a few seconds for one second really and then faded

489
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,420
Back, I think that was a crash and then and then and then about a couple minutes later. I

490
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:20,300
I had it they cut out and cut back clunk clunk, and I think it was because I had done updates

491
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,400
But I hadn't rebooted yet. I'm not sure so that's something I have to check

492
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,180
I still haven't even checked on it, so I wanted to read this state of the state of the plasma

493
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,100
I didn't want to read the whole thing just a couple of notes because I thought this first part really resonated with my past

494
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,820
Experience and I also you know before I get into this

495
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,840
I mean, I'm a little on tangents today cuz West got me this kickstart energy drink. That's right. I did

496
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,100
People sometimes say God you guys talk too much about solace or

497
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,160
Geez you guys been talking a lot about plasma recently

498
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:52,780
And there's that undercurrent of arch just all the time. Yeah, yeah sure sure so I have I think what it is is a

499
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:59,980
misunderstanding of the philosophy that I've begun to adopt for this show, and I haven't articulated it because I I don't often I

500
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,260
Don't often talk about these things right

501
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,700
But I believe I think one of the I think one of the number one things missing from tech

502
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,700
journalism

503
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,100
Would you know I've gone on plenty of tirades man?

504
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,100
I think it's just like journalism don't you one of the things I think is just the worst is

505
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:25,900
We come out with these big huge reviews of stuff like and I love like my favorite whipping boy is is the Windows 10

506
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,960
Cortana is gonna change everything Windows 10 is so amazing this this this this well

507
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,460
Where's all the follow-up reviews about Cortana and how useful it is where's all the follow-up the ones that really mean the most?

508
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,420
Where is it? Where is it a year after using it and so my?

509
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,180
Myself my philosophy is first of all this is a weekly show

510
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:48,060
So we got to have something to talk about every week and the second of all what I what we're what I'm trying to do

511
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,060
to in this in some sense is

512
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,820
Create a story arc of our experience with these things

513
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,060
So that way if you are a weekly listener

514
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,940
Every week you are getting an update in the story of our usage of these sort of like as for you Star Trek fans

515
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,440
It's like the difference between TNG and deep space 9

516
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:11,560
We're more deep space not exactly Linux action shows more TNG. You don't always get the little encapsulated

517
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,280
It's not the yeah, right you don't get the full review type thing

518
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,500
But you get dialogue with the creators you get our chats about daily use yeah, yeah

519
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,340
And so that's why we're talking about plasma again because in a few weeks

520
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,700
Maybe I won't be using anymore, and I won't be talking about it

521
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,380
But for right now that's part of the story of the show

522
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,420
And then we're gonna take just so we'll just take a couple of minutes and talk about it, so

523
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,940
He had something here that I thought was really pointed because it's essentially been my feelings

524
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,660
He says since 2014 plasma has kept me in

525
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,340
entertained and disappointed in equal in equal measures at some point

526
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,340
I had crowned my fate. I had it crowned as my favorite desktop

527
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:52,960
And then it started going downhill steeply and fast struggling to recover not helping was the slew of bugs and regressions across the distro space

528
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,900
Which exasperated the quality of plasma and what it could show to the world I?

529
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:03,300
Think that's so right on that is so right on with what was wrong with the plasma desktop for a long time

530
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,740
It is so freaking right on and you know that was you guys have even heard me come on the show my gal

531
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,500
I'm using plasma again. It's great, and then a few weeks later. I'm back on them. Yep

532
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,820
and

533
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,820
And that is exactly where I've been at

534
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,860
And I think neon is playing a huge role in showing us

535
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,980
How other distributions have gotten so damn close, but what neon is doing is really light touch it touches same defaults

536
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,380
And here's your packages. Here's your packages. Here's your packages

537
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,020
Oh, and yeah, yeah happens to be the folks behind the desktop are pretty relevant to the project itself

538
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:39,460
So that helps plot and you know one of the things I have found by switching over to it again after using gnome for a long

539
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,860
Time now is the plasma retains some of the functionality that's disappeared from gnome based systems

540
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,260
Including just like trivial things like being able to create new files using the right-click menu

541
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,820
Being able to right-click and it just built in I don't have to go find like some script on the internet and put it in

542
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,780
My action systems. It's just I right-click in a folder. I go to the actions menu. It says open terminal here

543
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,220
I use that I love that I use that 30 times a day every day

544
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,660
I use that because I have I organize things for different shows and different folders on my file system

545
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,980
And I'm constantly open up a terminal in that folder and doing work in it 30 times a day

546
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:17,900
I do that it is so nice to have that I can't even tell explain to you how nice that is and it's it's these little

547
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:22,020
Things that we just used to take for granted that have just started to disappear on some of our other desktops

548
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,020
That plasma still has they still have kept those traditions

549
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,640
So would part of this you say that maybe is plasma targeting like a loftier goal

550
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,300
And so gnome has an easier time of reaching what their

551
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:38,180
Deliverable is and as more gnome has a narrower goal or a nor. Yeah, right

552
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,100
It's like it's a simpler thing to reach and yeah, right there

553
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,860
They are kind of pursuing a more minimal path plasma

554
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,880
You know gnome has just a you you copy something you paste it

555
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:52,500
You don't get notifications about nothing about that whereas the plasma desktop has like one of the best clipboard managers

556
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,100
I've ever seen or used anywhere on any on any OS

557
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,420
And they're like yeah, we're gonna make this the super badass clipboard manager

558
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,420
It can be or yeah, we're gonna have the best one of the things that impressed me right away was that clipboard bit

559
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,220
Yeah, and the screenshot tool is like all of it's like some of their best stuff like

560
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,380
The calendar even just be able to click on the yes

561
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,260
I like great count

562
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,180
It's very useful the way that all cups props crops up

563
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,580
And I have a bunch of different time zones now that show up for me really simply I like that a lot

564
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:23,820
Now I'm gonna get to some criticisms that I've observed, but I'm just trying to articulate the differences having having spent

565
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:29,060
Over a year on gnome 3. Maybe it's been. I don't know how long have I been on arch

566
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,500
To three years now three years. Yeah

567
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,160
There are some issues that I have also observed

568
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,900
They're not bad bad anymore. This is the one that bugs me the most

569
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:48,820
Some windows open at rather odd default sizes with less than the full width of the drawn elements

570
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,980
And I have I have a 2k resolution screen

571
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,940
So this is really really obnoxious because they open like 640 by 480 size

572
00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:01,460
Which then truncates a portion of the window to the right and there's no automatic wrapping or rendering of window content

573
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,660
So you can literally miss critical elements of the UI or by that study exists, right?

574
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:11,900
Yeah, and then they have awkward scroll scroll bars that aren't centered with the element. They'll actually be scrolling and

575
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,700
Then if you just look at the screenshot here on the left

576
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,060
workspace

577
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:22,920
Workspace desktop effects and screen edge options all the same size icon then screen locking a different size icon then virtual desktops a distance

578
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,020
Different size square icon then accessibility around icon and then activities three dots

579
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:35,660
So this is just this one screen shows you this really bad mismatch that they have going on UI wise like they've gone

580
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,540
So they've come so far

581
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:44,300
But yet they have these consistent inconsistencies throughout the UI same thing with like the open and save dialogue

582
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,700
consistently opens

583
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:52,140
Way smaller than I need it to be again a 2k resolution. The first thing I always do I click and drag it better

584
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,140
Thank God that the K win drag

585
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,140
Effectance and look is so smooth and nice because I sure do it a lot

586
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,780
do it a lot and then the second thing I do is I expand the

587
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:06,820
Modified the kind and the name columns because they're never long enough because I they don't they don't resize when you redrag the UI

588
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:12,840
They stay that same small 640 by 480 size and you have to go redrag those and this adds three seconds to every file save

589
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:18,180
And open process. What's the point of that? It's ridiculous. It's again consistent inconsistency

590
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,580
There's other small things. I

591
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:26,020
Think if you use the default theme breeze and you use it in the light mode you

592
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:31,620
You you really run into a lot more problems if you go breeze dark it solves a lot of issues

593
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:39,940
So for example with the default theme the menu is slightly transparent and the description descriptor text under icons is so light

594
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,700
You can barely read it. If you go dark theme, it looks fine

595
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,060
There's a lot of little wigglies in this article that we're gonna link to in the show notes too that he ran into it

596
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,060
If you use dark theme, it's fine

597
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:53,260
Here's another one. That's a little odd when you're playing music when you click on the volume icon

598
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:59,940
It's a really nice widget you get live album art track information other desktops do this as well

599
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,820
But this one's really nice because it's got these big play controls, but they just look

600
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,700
Awful, they don't even render correctly. There's displacement in the play circle

601
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:14,160
It's it's just small stuff. You know the functionality is there. It's the way it's implemented is great

602
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,240
It works with like Spotify and my Google Play desktop client that I have and it's really nice

603
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,880
It just it's the UI of it's just a little awful. It was the only problem

604
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,680
There's just little things like that, but from where they were these things are minor enough now

605
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,500
That in my opinion even as somebody who gets a little annoyed by these things

606
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,400
To have this workstation class

607
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,520
desktop environment

608
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,320
That offers all of this functionality that seems to be running as well as it does is

609
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:46,380
Totally worth like these small little nuance issues that I think eventually probably even get worked out

610
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,680
That's kind of in my take oh, and oh, okay?

611
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:55,620
first of all the wallpapers the wallpaper setting thing is the worst of the of the system setting applets because I

612
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:01,620
Have a folder with like 200 wallpaper images in it that I'd like to rotate through and you have to add them one by one

613
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,320
And then there's no live preview even though a lot of the other settings do have live preview

614
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,620
There's no live preview for wallpaper

615
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:13,180
So it's like basic functionality stuff, and then I think the thing that most new users of the plasma desktop run into it

616
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:18,420
It's the thing that I should probably lead with the number one issue with plasma is this

617
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:27,260
Download new stuff from the internet screen that comes up when you want to add a theme a color scheme a plasma widget

618
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:33,740
It's one of the best and worst features of the plasma desktop is instead of like having to go in your web browser and find

619
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:38,780
A tar file and download it and then go and like drag it into like a dot folder somewhere like an animal

620
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,460
the plasma desktop says hey would you like to just

621
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:48,340
Download new widgets directly from our directory on the internet and it pulls down new add-ons or new widgets or new themes

622
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:54,900
but the reality is most of them are broken many of them have to lead you to an external website which sort of nullifies the

623
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,900
entire point of using an applet like this and

624
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:02,700
many of them do not work at all especially when it comes to the widgets and when it comes to the themes a

625
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,340
lot of them are incompatible with current versions of plasma and

626
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:13,420
It's just simply that no one in the project and I've I've gotten some fairly good confirmation on this

627
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,420
No one in the project has the time to go through and weed this thing out

628
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:21,500
It's a problem nobody wants to tackle, but it's one of the most unique things about the plasma desktop

629
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:26,300
And it's one of the first things I think a lot of new users try and it's one of the first things that breaks and doesn't

630
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,540
Work correctly which doesn't give you a great impression

631
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:34,660
Yeah, so there's there are there are some of these some of these problems like you often get a prompt that says

632
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,780
This is a this downloaded an HTML file which indicates

633
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,660
It's a link to a website instead of the actual download

634
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,620
Would you like to open the site with a browser instead and then it opens up your browser?

635
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:48,420
And then it usually takes you like KD look or something like that. It's vague what you're even supposed to do

636
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,160
It's just a really bad experience

637
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,260
So there's there's issues. There's definitely issues

638
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:58,340
I tell you I tell you what if you're willing to live with things like that

639
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,660
I think it's a pretty good desktop environment was I think you should give it another week

640
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:06,180
Have you messed at all with the launcher? No I have not so alt space

641
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:12,340
Will will launch krunner nice. Yeah, it's basically you'll do anything that the nicest launchers do

642
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:19,100
So you can you couldn't you can get and you can actually pass commands into you can see you can start console with button stuff happening

643
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:23,900
It's really nice, so player. I'd say take the week to play with play with that

644
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:30,780
Are you using a dark theme yes, okay? Good a breeze yes, all right? Well good good good you good there

645
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,340
Yeah, so play around with that you got KD wallet set up

646
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,140
I'll play more with some of the keyboard shortcuts see if I can make that I know you can do yeah

647
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,060
I'm sure I can yeah

648
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,380
Like one of the I think one of the things I had to do which I thought was kind of weird is I had to

649
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:46,260
Go in and set up like the keys. I always use to switch between virtual desktops. Yes

650
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,700
I was surprised that wasn't set up. Yes exactly wasn't that yep? I'll do some deep dive

651
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,260
Hey, when let's you do a lot of stuff, and there's there is like there's like an action

652
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:00,260
Area you can go in and create even things to do from yeah, I mean it's

653
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,220
It's pretty nice

654
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,860
Yeah, you can also

655
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,300
Here's a chat room saying there's a krunner widget you can put on the desktops you can see like applications

656
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,700
There's also one thing that do you use that at work that laptop?

657
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:16,940
Yeah, you might find I've never cared to use it

658
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,780
And I I struggle to really justify the even the feature

659
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:27,460
But it has activities and you could create a home activity and a work activity and they're like they're essentially totally different plasma desktops

660
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,780
That's kind of interesting you can have different widgets backgrounds panel layouts. Yeah

661
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:37,980
Console profiles all that stuff. It's kind of cool. So yeah, well. I'd be curious. Oh my god. You're right pixel pimp

662
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:43,060
Geez yeah, then and then of course. Oh my god. Yes, Katie a connect. Yeah, awesome. Oh, you have a setup

663
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:48,980
I have not installed. I've used it before even on gnome. I have not installed it this time around so maybe I'll do that

664
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,820
I I want to try it so bad. I'm half tempted to

665
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:58,300
To use my Nexus 6p again. Oh yeah, right does anybody know of a

666
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:06,540
What's a way what I mean, what is the what is the equivalent to find my phone find my friends on on?

667
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,540
Android

668
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,460
Find my friends is yeah, you don't tell you know what I'm talking about

669
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,980
Do you mean find your phone? No find my friends, which is is uses the same thing?

670
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,780
But you can you can set up friends where you can share location

671
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:27,900
I've never used that but you could use ways to do something similar. Yeah, no no it's it's always on tracking

672
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,320
Yeah, ways does that though? I think oh really stake and like there's a mode you can put ways

673
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,980
I don't want to be deprecated at this point, but there was a time like at least four years ago where that was a thing

674
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:40,100
So I have the kids phone, which is just like a shared phone

675
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,780
They have I have my phone and a deals phone, and we can all look each other's location up. Which is really cool

676
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,960
Okay, I see I feel like there's a way with Google Maps though or something

677
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,780
Go have it always on

678
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,780
Go ahead SK. You had something to say

679
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,300
Yeah, if you use the

680
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:01,540
Device manager app on Android, and you you have to have the whatever

681
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,020
Android devices you have on your

682
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:11,060
Account like my scrap draw gmail I can see them and I can also add like my wife's

683
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:18,520
Account also oh so and so I can so what it does is allows you to be able to see where those devices are you can

684
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,340
Lock them from remote if you yeah, you all the things you know, but she would have to then be on Android, too

685
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:26,340
So there's actually a cross-platform thing with the Google app

686
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,500
But I guess Android has that built-in so as long as you have play services in the Google app you can

687
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:38,300
Enable location history and then share the location histories and that's always on we see that I actually use that on iOS

688
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,980
I would be I'll have to play with that because I so all right, so

689
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,860
So what what is the app that you use on the iPhone? I?

690
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:52,580
Think it's just called Google is what they call the Google app. Oh wait really huh? Yeah, okay? Yeah, that's right

691
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:58,180
Yeah, okay, yeah, that's my location history continuously with that and there is actually a sharing feature boy

692
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:03,380
I have what it's one thing about using I know this is a this I this is an arbitrary line

693
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:08,320
But for some reason I just get creeped out about using a Google location tracking app like this just creeps me out

694
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,220
Yeah, it is interesting sometimes to review this cool

695
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:17,620
Though because they have a great dashboard for dealing with all your personalized data like that, and you can I know

696
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:24,540
Your trips throughout the day. Yeah, I know no I know yeah, yeah, I know I just worry about I worry about years and years and years

697
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:29,020
And years and years of analysis of my location data like I'm not worried about right now

698
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:34,260
I'm worried about like 10 years of using something like this. Yeah, what kind of in what kind of things can they inferred?

699
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,260
What kind of things could be subpoenaed?

700
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,460
That's my only concern really like Jimmy John's yeah, right

701
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:45,740
Yeah, and and what happens what happens to CEOs from our one CEO?

702
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:50,820
Yeah, sure that is a very good concern. Did they make a partnership with my health insurance company?

703
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:57,100
Because you know from that data they can derive also how fast I go sure yeah if I'm walking if you're walking

704
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:02,940
I think it's subpoena any of those applications, so it's really just I feel like Apple is putting your data there

705
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:08,940
I feel like Apple has demonstrated a willingness though to not participate in some cases so has Google absolutely yeah

706
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,700
I know that's why I say it's an arbitrary line. I've drawn. It's a pretty arbitrary line

707
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:18,700
I just would rather what I would really rather do is roll it on my own and have an app that just works on either

708
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:26,700
Platform, but I've experimented a little bit with that and they tend to be really crappy you guys and really really bad on battery life

709
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:33,460
Even though they're integrated well. Yeah, what do you have like busy polling for your stuff? Yeah, ah?

710
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:38,300
Huh interesting well the altera says that Google has recently made an announcement about this well

711
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,300
We should probably move on because this is not really

712
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:45,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah trusted contacts app will let you share your locations and emergencies not it's kind of not what I want

713
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:51,580
But huh you know let's why don't we before we get going let's let's let's talk about ting you know what this would be a great

714
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,080
Time this just kind of makes sense linux.ting.com if you want a mobile service provider

715
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:59,940
that's not playing games with you and announcing services turning services off and

716
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,140
Wearing gimmicky jackets you just go pay for what you use

717
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:09,060
This is really brilliant because it's just six dollars for the line and your usage on top of that

718
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:14,100
So you don't have to worry about getting a set amount of minutes or a set amount of data a set amount of text messages

719
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:20,860
And you don't have to worry about adding additional lines if you need something for a monitoring device or a family member or a tablet

720
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:26,780
It's just six dollars in your usage. I often have it. It's just I think I'm actually out now

721
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,800
But I have in the past and I guess I have to order some more

722
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:35,500
I've just had ting sims around and I've had a tablet that the kids were playing with and when Pokemon go was super popular

723
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:40,740
And this is just like hey, let's all go out as a family and walk around the trails and catch Pokemon

724
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,220
So but you got to have data connection. Yes, you do so

725
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,900
We get all set up and then that dawns on me. What do I do?

726
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:52,460
I better probably like buy a plan where you have to get a two-year contract like 10 gigs a month

727
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,620
I think it's not a contract a commitment a commitment. Oh, there we go. We change the word sure did yeah

728
00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:01,660
Yeah, no none of that. I put the ting sim in an Android tablet that I already had

729
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:06,780
There's a what just it was a Wi-Fi device that had an empty sim slot and we had we had data for the day

730
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:10,780
In fact, I just left it in there for a while because it's six dollars a month. I was like, well, maybe we'll do it

731
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,300
Again, we didn't do it again

732
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,820
We didn't do it again, but I was so thankful

733
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:19,140
I didn't bother like going down like because I have been there with friends in the past

734
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:24,820
I've been to the game myself like here get this free tablet after an 18 month a commitment. Don't worry

735
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:28,700
It's not a contract, but it's a commitment. It's an agreement to be our customer

736
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:33,860
You know there recently the other big guy the other big duopoly guy announced more plans for more money

737
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:34,580
That's right

738
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:39,460
And I find it fascinating because if you look at the way ting customers save money

739
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:45,380
The average ting line is twenty three dollars per device. So that's that's your data your minutes. Your message is

740
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,900
$23

741
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,180
so when when like Verizon's like announcing

742
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,420
$140 plans and 80 even $80 plans

743
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:59,520
It just blows my mind. Let's see. That's not my cable bill

744
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:06,060
Yeah, should be better than that. Yeah, I mean I I guess there's people that will buy like a $12 cup of coffee

745
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,980
Right and meanwhile, I'm like, yeah

746
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,500
It's too much money for coffee, right?

747
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,500
So I get I you know the other day I accidentally ended up paying 40 bucks for pizza

748
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,780
I've never paid that much for pizza, but I went to a round table

749
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:22,860
I walked in there and I had the kids with me and I got two larges the next thing I know I'm $46 done

750
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:28,580
I'm like what I gotta I gotta down this for 15 bucks. Yeah, right. They don't care the kids don't care

751
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:33,540
Like this is this is the problem with these guys and this is why they can come up with different gimmicks

752
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:38,220
They can announce different services with different things or different ways of destroying net neutrality

753
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,800
They can come up with these different gimmicks and they can call it freeloading or whatever. They call it

754
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,500
What do they call it back during that trial?

755
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:47,780
What do they call that where they offer you if they offer you like the ability to stream YouTube for free and then they call

756
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,780
It like a good thing. What's that called though?

757
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,220
Well, they have a name for it. Yes, they do. Oh, yeah. What is that?

758
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:59,580
What they all have different names though, don't they? Yeah, like T-mobile. Oh my god T-mobiles is so prevalent

759
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:04,420
They advertise it all the time. Yeah, the IRC's probably already got it. Yeah, it's this it's this it's this it's this

760
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,940
It's this cliche. It's this cliche gimmicky way of calling

761
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,140
Basically binge. Well, yeah, no badge on yeah

762
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,780
But what they're doing is like that they're like pro right they pay the bill or something for it

763
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,060
And it's just gonna destroy net neutrality, right? It's gonna here's what it's gonna do

764
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:22,060
Is it's gonna give YouTube an absolute monopoly

765
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:25,660
Because if you want to watch Jupiter broadcasting shows and you don't want to go against your data

766
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,340
Guess what you've got to do. You got to watch it on YouTube

767
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,780
You can't watch it from our website, which doesn't get takedowns from

768
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:36,180
Python bots it is available in HTML 5 WebM doesn't track you and

769
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:42,180
Then and yet guess what because they're free jacking this thing, but in the back door, that's what I call it

770
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,780
they're gonna they're gonna give YouTube a monopoly and

771
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:49,380
That these gimmicks these bench on gimmicks and there's all this data these

772
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,900
This is a smokescreen to get you to buy in in the million the mean

773
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:57,020
I mean meanwhile, you're paying for more than you would originally use anyways, I

774
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,580
definitely was

775
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,140
It really gets me fired up

776
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:07,220
Linux dot ting comm go there save twenty five dollars off a device or if you bring one and they got CDMA energy or her

777
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:12,340
You can just get a twenty five dollar service credit which probably pay for more than your first month

778
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:17,820
And I didn't even have time to tell you about their great control panel or awesome customer service Linux dot ting dot com

779
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:24,700
So speaking of Linux Linux 4.10 brings in a new feature. That sounds really cool

780
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,300
Hey, yo, but for all I know it could be bunk

781
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:35,040
It is virtual GPU support this release adds support for the Intel GVT dash G for KVM a full GPU

782
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:41,860
Virtualization solution with mediated pass-through starting with fourth generation Intel core processor

783
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,300
So has well

784
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:50,500
Pretty large. That's a pretty large market devices. That really got my attention there. This feature is based on the new VVF IO

785
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,580
mediated device framework and

786
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:56,820
So this is this so unlike direct pass-through

787
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:05,420
Alternatives the mediated framework allows for KVM KVM GT by the way to offer a complete virtualized GPU with full GPU

788
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,220
features to each one of the virtualized guests

789
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:11,020
This could be huge fire OBS in the cloud

790
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:15,180
William are you moon there? Is this a development you were actually following?

791
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,420
Kind of I don't actually necessarily plan to use it

792
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:23,060
But it's definitely cool to be able to have new device types that you can virtualize and share

793
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:28,060
So you could have a bunch of KVM instances using one GPU instead of having to have an individual GPU

794
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:31,200
On the back end is the video is the video hardware

795
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:37,980
Accelerating these these virtual. Yes, that's what that's partitioning being done inside of the GPU to allow each instance to run

796
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,500
I don't know how good the like quality of service type stuff is

797
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,940
At this point for it say Intel interesting

798
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:48,900
I know AMD also this release has something similar right if I'm not mistaken or landed on four nine

799
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:51,720
Might have been four nine, but it also could have been four ten

800
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,680
I kind of forget but yeah Intel and AMD should have this capability in for ten

801
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:58,340
This is so so people been wanting this for a long time

802
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:01,700
It could be big for a lot of different kind of virtualized solutions

803
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:07,500
You know there's definitely times wonder what this could mean for Windows 2 and you're not going to do much gaming with an Intel graphics

804
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:11,180
But could mean some graphics right would I guess it would depend on the driver

805
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:15,180
Actually nice if you're like say DigitalOcean and you want to provide GPU instances, right?

806
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:19,020
Right because then you don't have to buy an entire GPU per VM

807
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,660
Which would be kind of costly per month right partition it down?

808
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:26,000
Yeah, and so you can have cheaper GPU instances right our needs were really

809
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,220
We just needed some accelerated video support for OBS or OBS to work up in on a DigitalOcean droplet

810
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,840
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that could provide this too

811
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:38,940
Yeah, suddenly you just have the base support or like even if it makes you are like virtualized desktop suddenly not I think for

812
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:42,540
OBS and I think for like virtual desktop type stuff. Yeah, this could be great

813
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:46,100
Yeah, and you could do a bunch of open GL exactly all your browser stuff then works

814
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:53,260
Honestly wonder what it could also mean for video playback in VMs for like desktop sessions. I wonder if video play a VDI, right? Yeah

815
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,500
I'm excited about that, but that's there's of course

816
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,340
There's a crap ton of other stuff in for ten

817
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:02,300
But that just seemed like a good one that people might want to know about there's a whole list of stuff

818
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:06,780
Is there anything else you wanted? There's a couple of things like improved write back management

819
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:09,780
Oh, this should hopefully without having to switch your IO scheduler

820
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:14,820
You should be able to get some like less, you know, you're writing to a USB Drive. You're copying a giant file

821
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:18,100
It should have less interruptions now on your day-to-day desktop usage

822
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:22,540
I also thought it was interesting that you can now attach an eBPF program to C groups

823
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:26,820
So you can use this eBPF program to it's the Berkeley packet filter, right?

824
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,540
So you can use this to filter packets drop things that kind of stuff now

825
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:34,060
You can easily apply it to all your programs in a C group. That's huge. So that could be big for containers

826
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,100
Seems like it

827
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:38,100
Hmm. Yep

828
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:44,940
And in the same vein better support now for the Nexus 5 and 6. Oh really 6p here

829
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:49,480
There's a bunch of driver updates basically in all of the hardware categories

830
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,980
But specifically in USB and camera again getting another big round of updates

831
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,820
Isn't it great how often just a new kernel comes out?

832
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:00,420
You can install it run it BAM all of these updates some of this stuff like I say again with commercial desktops

833
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,420
You'd have to wait for the entire right next version

834
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,380
So cool speaking of next versions of things known

835
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:10,500
3.24 is entering beta final release is expected on March double deuce

836
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:16,940
With one day delay the beta release of the upcoming gnome dot 3.4 desktop environments finally here for public testing

837
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:24,140
We got a revamped gnome control center landing in this one with updated user printer and online accounts keyboard and mouse and Bluetooth panels

838
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:29,700
Also a sharing framework to make it easier for users to share things with other apps to other various online services

839
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:36,040
I'm curious about that one furthermore gnome music app gets a tag editing and own cloud integration

840
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:40,860
Next cloud will be available via online accounts panel gnome photos will import your photos

841
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:47,060
Epiphany web browser got a lot of new features and a revamp design and gnome calendar brings the week view and

842
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:54,860
And gnome software will handle snap and apt URLs now hey yeah, and of course a flat back and it looks like models file manager

843
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,020
promises to let users browse files as root

844
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:03,220
There's also there's another big feature coming that I'll mention here in a second, but I wanted to segue and say

845
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:09,860
1704 of ubuntu will be the first ubuntu in a very long time

846
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:15,460
That will actually ship with current gnome what which has been a big criticism for a while

847
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:20,620
Yeah, so annoying yeah, the upcoming beta of you know Ubuntu gnome 1704

848
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:27,380
Is already showing the promise, but there is a bit of a caveat not all of gnome 324 will be in it

849
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:33,480
This is I'm sure there's a great reason, but this is so Ubuntu

850
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:39,460
This is so Ubuntu the latest version of many core gnome apps will be available including gnome calendar

851
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:47,160
Totem and gnome diss others are earlier versions because there is no recent update available like gnome weather or Ubuntu

852
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,160
Ops to include an older

853
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,360
aka patched version

854
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:58,880
Like Nautilus gnome software aka Ubuntu software is also stuck to the older version of the gnome 322 version

855
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:04,520
Though it's a much more recent build than the 320 release that shipped a 1604 1610 and yes

856
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:09,540
They'll include flat pack support and snap URL support in it now. This is the big feature that I

857
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:15,400
Haven't a lot of people talk about is the nightlight feature in gnome 3.24. This could be pretty badass

858
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,900
It's a as you kind of could probably guess from the name

859
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,160
It says it's a new setting that automatically adjusts the color temperature and brightness of your display

860
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:27,680
Depending on the time of day to help reduce eye strain and help promote natural sleep cycles

861
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,140
You probably familiar with a lot of we've talked about a lot of different apps flux redshift, etc

862
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:37,760
Yeah, and so now it's built right in yeah, no nightlight reduces the amount of blue light the display admits becomes warmer

863
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,580
And the overall brightness is reduced

864
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:44,160
It is one of those things where it's like I can install no and just not have to configure that you know

865
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,880
Yeah, the less things I can configure it just that's nice. I think it's kind of a cool thing

866
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:54,400
Yeah, and there's been some extensions to do this and while we're on before we move off of gnome. I wanted to put a call-out and

867
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,480
I'm gonna probably have to mention this again, too

868
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:02,080
but the gnome conference Gwadek in Manchester is coming up the 28th and the

869
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:08,280
Second through the 2nd of August Gwadek brings together free software enthusiast professionals from all over the world

870
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:13,320
It's six days of talks demos discussion parties games and more six days. That's awesome

871
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:17,720
Yeah, and I I would be willing to go get my passport and go

872
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,780
And I got an invite to do so

873
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:27,460
and I just I can't really figure out how to make the money work because you know my hack to go into these events

874
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:30,060
Is I take I live in an RV and I take you drive there. Yeah

875
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:36,620
That doesn't work so well when it's in Manchester, so I don't think I know the RV over Chris

876
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:41,200
Yeah, I don't think I think that's probably way expensive. I don't I don't I don't think I can make it

877
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,660
I just don't think I can swing it. I would love to go

878
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:48,160
I would first of all your job audience is to just all start saying you're going and just force them to go

879
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:48,600
No

880
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:52,320
I want what I'm hoping is maybe somebody legitimately wants to cover it for us

881
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:56,240
Because I could probably get you press coverage if you're really willing to work with us

882
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,160
I can't pay you for it

883
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,600
But if you just want to work with us and do some recording for us and probably just audio

884
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:08,040
I bet we could probably get you in this press if you're willing to officially work with JB

885
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,040
I maybe be my eyes and ears on the ground

886
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:15,680
God, I would love to go because I've never been to an event outside the US like this

887
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,840
It's never I mean the only other country outside the US I've gone to is Canada

888
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,120
So that would be awesome, but not this year

889
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:29,040
I don't think if I had more time to plan, but July when you own a small business July is not that far away

890
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:34,000
So if you can make it a Gwadek the 20th of July through the 2nd of August

891
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:34,840
You don't have to go the whole time

892
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:38,640
I suppose but you could go a good portion to find it out find out you can go to

893
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:44,720
2017 dot Gwadek org will have a link in the show notes. I'd love to get an maybe a couple eyes and ears on the ground

894
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,600
even

895
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:50,240
The JB perspective yeah really get some I think this sounds like a fascinating conference

896
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,240
It sounds like a hell of an event for six days

897
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:56,200
It's got to be a party, so I would love to I would love to get a sense of that

898
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:01,320
also congratulations to our friends over at elementary they successfully

899
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:07,380
Funded their open or their new pay what you want app center initiative right? Oh, this is great

900
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,880
yeah, so they're gonna be going to Denver and doing a

901
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,000
Rush over there to put to put this thing all together

902
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,340
And then I'm sure we'll eventually get our hands on it

903
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:20,440
And get a chance to review it and see where they've come up with but I for those of us like myself who think this is

904
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:25,360
An interesting idea at least even if it's not gonna be a huge thing that right takes over to Linux software distribution

905
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,580
But even if it's just something that we get to try out in a corner of Linux

906
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:31,520
I think it's I think it's a fascinating worthy effort, and so I'm really happy to hear they got funding

907
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,340
It's nice to see yeah

908
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:37,120
It's nice to see the community a community backing them and what I keep doing and you know this isn't this is there

909
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:42,080
They've had some success now their community is coming through a couple of it has come through a couple of times now

910
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:46,240
It's pretty cool to see that too. We need that in the open-source world word West word

911
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,100
Oh my gosh

912
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:51,560
We have so much more to get to and tech snaps coming up, so you know what I want to talk about

913
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,040
Something that I think is gonna change Noah's life

914
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:59,520
Something that I wouldn't be surprised if you have stacked on that little stack of notebooks and laptops you have there

915
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:05,120
West so let's take a moment and I think Linux Academy for sponsoring the show go to Linux Academy comm

916
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:11,120
Unplugged to sign up for their platform to learn more about Linux with labs with hands-on scenarios

917
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:18,080
Instructor mentoring real human beings core schedulers you can pick a time frame that fits your schedule and learning goals

918
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:25,000
Learning paths which are series of courses and content planned by instructors their lab servers spin up on demand their video courses

919
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,120
Which are self-paced in-depth courses on every damn Linux cloud and DevOps topic

920
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:35,080
They have a great community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members comprehensive study guides you take with you audio

921
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:37,320
You can listen to on the go speaking of on the go

922
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:42,520
They got iOS and Android apps smart tools that really work with the particular session or lab

923
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,320
You're doing and I should probably mention it three times

924
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:50,200
But I think the human instructors are a huge component Linux Academy's been blowing up

925
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,840
And you can check out their Twitter feed to get a little sense of that

926
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:57,020
They've got a great guide on managing Docker containers with ansible up on their site now

927
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:01,880
And they've you know they're just expanding their content on a weekly basis so much your management

928
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:07,480
Just throw buzzwords at you Linux Academy's got those covered. Yeah, BAM containers. Yeah, I

929
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,520
configuration management if

930
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:15,080
If I worked in a place that offered any kind of budget for learning cuz you know Linux Academy's super straightforward

931
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:19,260
You can sign up for a seven-day free trial just to get a sense for it at Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

932
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,840
This would so be my go-to they have profiles that help you show your employer what you're doing or a potential employer

933
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,680
It's a great way to try out something new and with their lab servers

934
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,800
You can really get a sense of how it works so then when you go to use it in production

935
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:35,040
You know what the hell you're doing break it up Linux Academy. Don't break it exactly Linux Academy comm slash

936
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,680
unplugged

937
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:43,440
So it's the GPD pocket a 7-inch Ubuntu laptop. That's going up for crowdfunding on Indiegogo

938
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,240
That's right a 7-inch laptop. This thing is a little mental

939
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,000
It's got 128 gigabytes of storage 8 gigabytes of RAM it runs Ubuntu 1604

940
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,420
It's got an Intel Atom a Z

941
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:02,140
E8 750 cpu which is a quad core clock to 1.6 gigahertz, okay, yeah

942
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:10,260
7,000 milliamp battery which they estimate to be around 12 hours year right 802 11 AC Bluetooth a couple of us

943
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,260
type-c yeah, buddy and

944
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,420
Headphone jack hey you have to say that these days

945
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:20,420
You just have to look at that keyboard that when I saw that I went. Oh this might actually be legit right

946
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:24,420
Can you believe they got a QWERTY keyboard that size on the device that small?

947
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:31,940
If those are even slightly okay to use that is an incredible layout now obviously for you audio audience listeners

948
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:37,700
There's huge compromises the arrow keys are a mess the shift key is a disaster the caps key

949
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:41,020
They shouldn't even bother the key travel is incredibly shallow

950
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:45,600
Yeah, but but still damn look at that thing look at that

951
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,820
They really cool just to pull out of your pocket and be able to use ten times more useful than a tablet

952
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:58,060
I dare say plus. Yeah, it has you see that full HD resolution. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and so down and and it's got it

953
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:02,020
I say earlier. It's got an SD card slot, so you could you could expand storage. Just like on the go

954
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,980
It's essentially a seven inch laptop

955
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,980
They don't have a great they don't have a great video

956
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:09,940
But it does show you like some of the some of the different side

957
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:15,740
It it almost looks like it looks like a baby Mac. It kind of does yeah. Yep it is

958
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,420
This is really something I

959
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:25,780
Actually, I am extremely excited. I believe the 12-hour battery life given that processor that processor draws almost no power really well

960
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:29,540
Okay, and I guess the screen isn't huge so it'll be a little slow

961
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:35,340
But there are other laptops based on it that are somewhat. Okay, so it would fit in your coat pocket

962
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:38,920
Yeah, that's the nice or a purse. That's the real draw. Yeah

963
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:45,020
Has a full keyboard has a you know what exactly yeah, what do you think of that another mouse though?

964
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:46,100
What do you think of that there?

965
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:50,900
It is compared to a Macbook if you're looking at the video whoa, what do you think of that nubbin mouse for it's essentially like?

966
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,620
the the

967
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:57,380
Lenovo nipple yeah, I've always been a fan of those so I mean I do use a regular trackpad

968
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:01,100
But I think I could get by just fine with that the only thing with the nipple though is it's in a weird place

969
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:05,160
Because on most other things it's where like the F and the G and the H right it's a little

970
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:10,580
Down at the spacebar, which is yeah, you're gonna have to retrain your muscle memory a bit yeah

971
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:15,260
But for me, I think I would primarily end up using this as a terminal type interface

972
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:20,260
You know where I've got the full keyboard power, and if I've got my keyboard shortcuts for most things pay now

973
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:22,260
this is a crowdfunder and

974
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:27,040
So this I like to take a little bit of a skeptical view they've already popped their goal

975
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:33,100
They're 709 percent of a 200,000 goal they got 1.4 million US greenbacks right now backed by

976
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:37,020
3460 backers so they've

977
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:43,300
Hopefully got a good shot the thing that I'm not loving is a lot of these photos are mock-ups with

978
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:49,460
Gimped in screens that are so badly gimped in that we could tell yeah, and like this one

979
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:54,100
These are just plastic keys are not even it's not even a real keyboard in fact in the most of these promos

980
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,940
It's not that's not a real functional unit that one's not none of these are actually

981
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,660
all of these all of these are gimped in and

982
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,220
That's it looks like

983
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,900
It looks like Safari on Facebook

984
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:11,100
So it's that you know and like this one this one doesn't have any ports like these are not these are not productive

985
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,500
Those are kind of strange like the key travel looks or the keys themselves even look huge

986
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:19,220
Yeah, what the mock-up 3d thing look yeah, the 3d render looks good

987
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:25,260
But it it kind of looks like it just kind of looks like it's I would really like to see real physical units now

988
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,220
They looks like it's gonna be a brick though a little bit. It's kind of thick yeah

989
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:32,580
And they say you know it's gonna be about seven hundred and ninety bucks. I guess

990
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:37,740
Wait, I know you get two of them for seven hundred ninety damn. Yeah exactly. It's like 400 each

991
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:44,300
I think for the promo price yeah, it's for the prompt for the promo price you get it estimated June 2017 geez if I had the

992
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:49,500
Money, I would buy this for Noah wait. They don't even have a real unit, and they're planning to ship by June

993
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:54,900
They must I mean see this is I feel like they must not be native English speakers because they're not being clear on some of

994
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:55,980
this stuff

995
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,980
How because we're they gonna get a?

996
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:03,660
Anyways, they're gonna get a what well the screen look at the IPS the the PPI on the screen

997
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:06,540
It's an IPS display with a three hundred and twenty three

998
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,380
PPI

999
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:12,020
This is probably just a phone screen though more or less or a tablet. It's gonna be yeah

1000
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:18,300
These exist though. Yeah, but that's a I mean that that has to be that screen in the Nexus line

1001
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:22,340
That would have to be an already manufactured display is what I'm getting yeah, I think it is though

1002
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:27,740
It might be they're just bolted it on so you can get a 399 funding like right now

1003
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:33,540
399 for a base unit 409 if you want it with a type-c you hub that's cool

1004
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:40,320
Oh, huh look at them getting fancy look at them getting fancy you get then you'll get $200 off their final retail prices

1005
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:46,360
What we will give you an incredible low price this perk we will provide a gpd pocket win 10 and type-c hub

1006
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:48,360
Oh, you just get a hub I

1007
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:53,700
See then you get $200 off the shipping unit yikes. It's confusing. Can I just say that I love?

1008
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,900
the

1009
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:59,680
Newfound prevalence of USBC yeah boy. Yeah pixel owner

1010
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:04,860
I bet you do I sure do so they're their crowdfunding price looks like you get it for like 400 and then retail price is gonna

1011
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:09,300
Be $5.99 US green are they close to being funded have they are either way they pop. Oh, that's great. Oh great

1012
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,420
709 percent

1013
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,900
1.4 million dollars of a wanted 200

1014
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:17,820
200 seems like it was never gonna be so is this is this for you?

1015
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,700
Or would you forever burn?

1016
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:24,260
You know I don't know. I don't know if this is really for me

1017
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:28,540
I think if I don't I basically I don't commute

1018
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:34,940
Outside of I don't I mean I drive to the studio like I drive around, but I'm not like you're actually driving, right?

1019
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:39,060
Yeah, you know time you get a laptop if I if I was on a train or a bus a lot

1020
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:42,600
I think this I think I'd be a big candidate for this if I took a lot of public transit

1021
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,560
Or I you know uber taxi that kind of thing or if I'm Noah

1022
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:51,560
And I'm going to a lot of clients every day, and I could see it. Yeah put it in the table you need like

1023
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:58,200
Especially with how good like things like the XPS 13 or where you're already at a pretty reasonable size for a bag

1024
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,760
I mean, this is really I'm putting in my pocket. That's up

1025
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,740
Yeah, because you can just carry it around that's a big game-changer

1026
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:08,240
And I got some big pockets so they would be or a purse you know like or small

1027
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:12,360
They're so jealous of Adidas purse like cuz I'll just like sometimes like can you just carry my wallet

1028
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,280
This is so sweet. You got a big old phone. She just puts that in there

1029
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,440
You know and this could be one more thing it'd be a little heavy, but if you needed to carry something around with you

1030
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:23,360
She's eight gigs of RAM to is generous on a device like this

1031
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:28,120
I could get by in 120 gigabytes of storage no problem. I think it's interesting they call it 128 gigs of ROM

1032
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,280
Yeah, yeah

1033
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,320
There's warning signs

1034
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:41,040
They say the screen this must be a tablet because it's got a 300 not only does it have the 323 PPI

1035
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:44,880
But it's got it's got Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and it's multi-touch

1036
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:51,560
With a 16 by 10 aspect ratio wait wait this is touch. I didn't I didn't realize that either. That's what it says

1037
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,320
That's what it says

1038
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,720
Yeah, that's what it says

1039
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:57,880
See you look at that screen. It does almost look at that

1040
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,120
It almost looks like a tablet bolted on a little bit

1041
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,720
You know it's kind of is why would it not be and that's what everybody wants anyway, right?

1042
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,920
That's what with a keyboard that might make it more doable

1043
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:11,120
It might make it possible to actually ship this thing because if they don't have that screen

1044
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:15,720
If they don't have that screen this things that this thing's dead on arrival. There's no way they're gonna build it

1045
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:20,880
Boy, that is screens are cheap, so I wouldn't be surprised. This is just not an issue. I don't know man

1046
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,280
I don't know. I well so

1047
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,960
It weighs point four hundred and eighty kilograms

1048
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:33,160
It is tiny look at that guy holding it there in his hand that is I would I would love to get a device like that

1049
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,840
Eventually I think still a pretty hefty thing though a pound. I have been yeah

1050
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:43,280
I know I you know I think my 6p with a case sometimes it's almost about probably is you're right

1051
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:47,120
I I only thing is I have been so burned

1052
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,880
I have like a 30% success ratio with crowd funders, right?

1053
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:57,920
I really help like you know blaster. I ordered like this brew it yourself brew kit never care never came never got

1054
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:03,080
I'm still waiting on a Kickstarter from 2013. Yeah, yeah, oh, and then I got I think they're going to deliver

1055
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:05,840
They keep telling us they're gonna deliver, so we'll see I'm kind of excited

1056
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,320
Just to see if they actually pull it off this one. I got really burned on I ordered a

1057
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:14,680
Really nice cast iron skillet though. It's a light cast iron skillet. That's awesome great for the RV

1058
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,680
It's not super heavy, but it's supposed to be really high quality

1059
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:21,360
Now it's changed to from the cast iron skillet. I get a $200 coupon

1060
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,600
What?

1061
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,840
Yeah, this is kind of what they're doing here, too

1062
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,800
I just know you get a coupon for what to buy the to buy the $500 skillet

1063
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,840
Oh my god the prices turned out to be a little more than they could afford

1064
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,480
So they're here well, but now it's now

1065
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,640
It's just another couple hundred dollars, and then they keep and I'm not gonna do it

1066
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:45,160
But they keep sending me emails about it. Oh last chance last chance last chance yeah, whatever nope whatever

1067
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,960
Alright, so I got to play this quote from Linus

1068
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,120
so this is where we're gonna take out the show with this and

1069
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:57,640
I I also I often have rants against the tech media

1070
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:02,200
I think they're awful and Linus was asked to reflect on 25 years of releasing. I like this yeah

1071
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,760
I thought it was pretty great digital ocean calm

1072
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:11,840
Go there sign up support the show do unplugged apply to your account and get a $10 credit digital

1073
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,740
Ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider

1074
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:19,160
Dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up your own server like that you go there you get set up

1075
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:25,080
And you're a boss in total boss mode great distributions to choose from preloaded applications one-click deployments

1076
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,800
And then an interface to manage it that is booty full

1077
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:36,120
Simple, but extremely powerful yeah such a thing actually exists go see it in the wild at digital ocean calm and use our promo

1078
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:42,320
Code deal unplugged it's probably worth it just to see how you should design an interface to manage virtual servers all over the world yeah

1079
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:46,920
They got data centers all over the world and use our promo code deal unplugged you get the $10 credit

1080
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:53,940
You can buy up spin up a $5 rig run of two months absolutely for free or try out their hourly pricing get it really nice

1081
01:17:53,940 --> 01:18:00,220
I love two core rockin rig two gigs of RAM poof go try it out use the promo code deal unplugged and by the way

1082
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:02,580
You know I was joking in our in our

1083
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:05,460
chat I was joking like

1084
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:11,540
Maybe it's time to replace our libs in downloads with this new digital ocean feature because this could be like set up a couple

1085
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:15,020
Of droplets put this in front of it this could start changing the game for a lot of people

1086
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:21,700
I I just starting to just sort of think about like how maybe different projects could use something like this especially on release day

1087
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:24,340
Digital ocean has rolled out a load balancer service

1088
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:28,580
you can scale your web apps and stuff of course the servers and

1089
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:35,140
Improve availability across your entire infrastructure all just built right into the freaking digital ocean interface

1090
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:40,260
Just a couple of clicks. You don't have to be like some sort of server maniac

1091
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:46,300
Well, you don't got to be like this west guy over spinning up the LXD containers on systems all over the world to handle capacity

1092
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:52,820
You can improve availability you can scale to traffic needs. It's very simple to set up. It's $20 a month

1093
01:18:54,220 --> 01:18:56,220
Hourly it's basically like

1094
01:18:56,540 --> 01:19:02,500
It's like pennies less than a penny. It's less than a penny. Yeah with additional bandwidth no additional bandwidth charges

1095
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:06,320
It's available in all data center regions and of course

1096
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:12,260
You can also use they're really straightforward API man. I love it. I know I'm a believer

1097
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:16,540
I am a real it really is simple. It is really nice the way we've been able to integrate it with our workflow

1098
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:23,820
Digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplugged and a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring this here

1099
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:30,780
Unplugged program so Linus was asked to reflect on the last 25 years of Linux, and he's like oh gosh

1100
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:33,740
Well, I'll play the clip for you. He's like I get this question a lot. Let me tell you what I hate

1101
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:35,740
I thought this was great

1102
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:40,900
You've been releasing the Linux kernel for

1103
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:43,460
25 years

1104
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:52,300
You know, it's just an amazing amount of fortitude for anyone to do the same thing for 25 years

1105
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:55,560
I understand you took a six-month break. It sounds like to do this git thing

1106
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:58,500
but

1107
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,500
It was actually more just two months

1108
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:06,420
In a very short break for a minor minor effort, but

1109
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:09,460
the last question is sort of you know, you got

1110
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:11,420
almost

1111
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:12,700
900

1112
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:17,320
organizations that participate in all the different Linux foundation projects here that are creating code at

1113
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:21,740
in almost every aspect of computing and these aren't just you know a

1114
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:28,560
Fast following present. These are the core main projects for the automotive sector the telecom sector

1115
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:34,440
What for you? Was there a moment where you thought aha?

1116
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:41,120
This is huge. This is much bigger than maybe what you thought when you started was there

1117
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,040
Can you imagine how many times you must get this question?

1118
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:48,800
Oh, this has got to be one he gets like almost every time he does one of these things or any particular thing that you

1119
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,760
I've answered that before there hasn't really been anything like that

1120
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,040
There's been a couple of moments that took me by surprise

1121
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,760
But the big moment was actually when it went from past being personal

1122
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,480
Like and that was within six months of just releasing it

1123
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:10,780
It was I don't even know the people working on sending me patches like know them personally. I mean, obviously

1124
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,480
Now I know them by email, but but there's a ton of people

1125
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:20,800
I've never met and just going past that initial personal phase where the project was just for me

1126
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,920
I do want to kind of mention the whole

1127
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,400
25 year thing

1128
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,520
I'm a huge believer in

1129
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,520
Just

1130
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:39,820
The 99% sweat 1% I will 99% perspiration 1% inspiration thing

1131
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,960
any technology project

1132
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,400
the innovation that this

1133
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,640
Industry talks about so much is bullshit

1134
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:57,920
Innovation anybody can innovate don't don't do this big think different don't do these big

1135
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,560
Innovation thing screw that it's meaningless

1136
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:04,040
like it the

1137
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,280
99% of it is

1138
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:14,280
Get the work done, right and and there are I actually that's my least favorite part of the technology

1139
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,340
Like new cycle is this constant

1140
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:20,700
innovation

1141
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:25,740
New ideas and this will revolutionize all that hype is is

1142
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:31,980
That's not where the real work is. Yeah, the real work is in the details and I'm

1143
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:35,620
obviously one of those people who just I

1144
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:43,340
Like to concentrate on one project I don't like flitting from one idea to another and and

1145
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:45,980
You need the people who just?

1146
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:51,500
Flutter about and come up with ideas, but they're not the really useful ones

1147
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:55,360
They're the ones who who they end up being the ones

1148
01:22:56,980 --> 01:23:02,540
Ideas the people who then do the work, so I hope you guys I mean that's

1149
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:09,340
What anybody should take away from this talk is the people who actually do the work are the ones you should

1150
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:16,680
Really listen to and it these days. I don't actually do the work anymore. I I merge other people's work, but I

1151
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,360
like

1152
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:23,060
Conferences to to be less about the

1153
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:30,440
Visionary innovation thing and more about the day-to-day. What are my problems and how do I want to solve them?

1154
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:36,080
That was pretty good. I like it. I did I I will link to the entire video

1155
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:39,640
I did it I did enjoy that entire talk, but I thought that was kind of the newest stuff

1156
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:43,000
We had heard from Linus was in that particular moment. You can watch the entire video

1157
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,720
We have it embedded in the show notes. Thank you for joining us for 185 find Wes on the Twitter

1158
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:55,000
Where do they go with at West Bay indeed you coffee maniac? I am at Chris LAS the network is at Jupiter signal

1159
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:58,140
Thanks for joining us join us at jblive.tv next week

1160
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:03,520
You could participate in the virtual lug hang out in our chat room and don't forget to give us your feedback at

1161
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:07,320
The exact you show dot reddit.com. Thanks for being here. See you next Tuesday

1162
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,520
Oh

1163
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,500
Okay, Wes, do you want to see my old Bitcoin mining?

1164
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,580
Yes, I do. Does it come with some Bitcoin?

1165
01:24:53,740 --> 01:25:00,120
So I was asking no I was asking Angela to send me photos because I was gonna rep about how long I've actually used

1166
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:07,120
Kde so this is a photo of Angela from like 2008 and she's using an old busted CRT monitor

1167
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:10,220
But what you can't tell there is she's using open office or star office

1168
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:13,080
I can't remember what we use at the time on the on the plasma desktop

1169
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:17,640
That's a man and this is her upset when she couldn't get her screensaver to unlock so she could log into the KD

1170
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:24,220
It wasn't called plasma back then. It's just called the KD desktop. Yeah, but there it is the the first Bitcoin mining iteration

1171
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:25,680
I had I had a Windows box

1172
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:31,440
I tried it on and this here was I can't remember if it was Sousa based, but it was also a KDE desktop

1173
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:36,920
I think that was like if the entire distro was the point of the entire distro was to mine Bitcoin

1174
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:41,220
Wow, that's just what it did. Is that Windows on the right there? Yeah, and then this here is yeah

1175
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:45,240
Well, this is a this way this machine ran through various different iterations

1176
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:48,760
but I was always kind of switching depending on which one mind the Bitcoin and

1177
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,820
Depending on how the testing was going to see what I liked about of course using the plasma desktop here

1178
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:56,640
And others is you could put widgets on here. If you look below Wes

1179
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,600
Ladies and gentlemen, there it is the very Dell

1180
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,780
I reviewed just recently on the Linux action show in service as a Bitcoin mining rig

1181
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:08,780
That machine has been through hell and I just booted it up recently. Look at that a retro look. Yeah

1182
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:15,040
Yeah, you can see over here too. I had the Radeon drivers up so I could watch the CPU temperatures and same thing here

1183
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,940
I'm watching the voltages and the temperatures and setting all of that

1184
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:24,300
Yeah, boy, and that's how you got so rich today. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh boy. There you go

1185
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:30,180
JB titles comms your daughter come there. We gotta go boat now. We gotta go boat. Thank you mumble room

1186
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:34,900
Thank you very very much. You guys always the best assess. It was good to have you here now

1187
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:40,100
Help me go pick a title won't you and then we got to get out of here cuz mr. Wes and Dan are gonna do

1188
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:47,100
Turns out everything's broken and will infect your system. So, you know, we have to talk about that. Yeah, I recognize that crazy monitor

1189
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:51,620
Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's old too that you know, what's funny about that monitor

1190
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:56,580
First this screen right here this KDS KDS, which I don't even think is around anymore

1191
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:00,560
First LCD monitor I've ever bought VGA monitor

1192
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:08,180
Power and VGA cord are integrated. I think I spent $300 and Angelo was so mad at me for spending that much money on a screen

1193
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:10,220
So mad at me

1194
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:17,380
Literally still using that monitor to this day. It's out in the garage hooked up to our Proxmox server. I

1195
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:23,980
And I bought that I bought that when LCD screens when 15 inches was just when it got like the three four hundred

1196
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:26,960
It might have been four hundred dollar price range 15 inches

1197
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:33,260
Horrible refresh rate response time just the worst but the damn thing still I mean I haven't turned it on in weeks

1198
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:39,100
But still works. All right plasma injection plasma pontifications. Did you like that deep space nine thing?

1199
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:44,300
I think I love I realized we hadn't really explained why we sometimes talk about we just sort of got in defense mode of

1200
01:27:44,300 --> 01:28:09,540
We're gonna talk about this stuff, and I never really got into the reason why we do it
