00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Every now and then, I see a post on Reddit

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,440
that makes me feel like an inadequate human being.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,760
This post is one of those that I don't think

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,720
in my entire life, if I lived another 70 years,

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,160
another 80 years, if I lived to be 180,

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,160
I could never accomplish this.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,940
This guy made his own smartwatch

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,100
from like 3D printed wood or something.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,940
Did you see this?

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,760
Yeah, it's incredible.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,980
And that was my first thought too.

12
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,860
In no way will I ever do this.

13
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,620
Wait, you could 3D print wood?

14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,320
Well, it's like a wood composite.

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,600
It's like a mixture.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,900
It is one handsome smartwatch though.

17
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,720
Yeah.

18
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,800
Yeah, you put sawdust in with the plastic filament

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,920
and it kind of comes out as like a wood filler.

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,220
Oh, so it's got like a grain and stuff.

21
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,160
Yeah, oh, for sure.

22
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,420
Yeah, it looks like a nice wooden watch.

23
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,360
It's a round one that he built himself

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,920
and he has all of the models and specs up on Imgur.

25
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,120
Even the printing process,

26
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,820
you can actually watch it get printed.

27
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,700
Yeah, the other impressive part to me is I assume like,

28
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,360
okay, it's gonna put some sort of Android

29
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,400
or some other common platform,

30
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,560
but no, it looks like he wrote all the software himself

31
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,400
in C.

32
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,080
And is it GNU slash Linux?

33
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,240
Let's just say it is.

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,080
You wanna just say it is?

35
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,240
No, I think it's all just running on an embedded device.

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,740
No, I'm pretty sure it's GNU slash Linux.

37
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,100
Yeah, I'm pretty sure, Wes.

38
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,600
Yeah.

39
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,120
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 300,

40
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,600
recorded early on May 2nd, 2019.

41
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:33,080
Well, hey there, welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

42
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,160
My name is Chris.

43
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
My name is Wes.

44
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,360
Hello, Mr. Payne, looking dapper in that vest as always.

45
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Oh, thank you.

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,440
Let's take a moment right here at the top of the show

47
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,480
and welcome the newbie, our brand new editor.

48
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
It's Drew.

49
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Hello, Drew.

50
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Hello, hello.

51
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,520
How do you feel over there coming in?

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Great.

53
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
It is wonderful to be here.

54
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
It's nice to have you here.

55
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,080
Yeah, Drew is our second editor now.

56
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,040
Of course, Joe isn't going anywhere.

57
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,840
Now we are a team with two editors.

58
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,240
Man, we have editing superpowers,

59
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,480
so we have no excuse for bad audio.

60
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
I know.

61
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,600
Oh, crap, maybe we shouldn't say that, actually.

62
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,160
And of course, joining me as always here in the studio

63
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
is our crew.

64
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
Hello, cheese.

65
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,160
Hey, what's going on, man?

66
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,160
How's it going?

67
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,160
Brock's in the front of the line.

68
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,720
Brock's in the front of the line, man.

69
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,720
You know it, baby.

70
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
You know it.

71
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,320
Now, also joining us in studio, the one, the only, Joe Rezington.

72
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Hello, Joe.

73
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
Hello.

74
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Hello.

75
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Hello, sir.

76
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
How are you doing over there?

77
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
You feeling better?

78
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Yeah, mostly.

79
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,000
Still a little bit jet lagged, but happy to have Drew on board

80
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
taking some of the load.

81
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,720
Yeah, it came in at a good time because-

82
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,720
I mean, you were working crazy hours.

83
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,840
Like, we don't want Joe to kill himself.

84
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,400
We got to take some of the load off.

85
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
Yeah, absolutely.

86
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,040
And also very happy to have Alex here.

87
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Hello, Alex.

88
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Hello.

89
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Hello, Mr. Badger.

90
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,280
Good to have you on board as well,

91
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,040
especially for today's topic.

92
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,520
We'll talk about many, many things in today's podcast

93
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,100
as we are one to do, as we are one to do.

94
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,800
But nominally, we wanted to have another shot

95
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,840
at talking about Fedora 30.

96
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,020
We had to give just a quick mention in last week's episode

97
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,440
because our time had been focused on Linux Fest Northwest.

98
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,040
And it was hot off the presses at the time.

99
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Right.

100
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,720
But now we've had a little bit of chance to kick the tires.

101
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,880
And we'll tell you about our perfect Fedora setups

102
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,240
that we've landed on, as well as some really, really cool spins

103
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,440
that I'd never had a chance to play around with before.

104
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,240
And I used this release of Fedora as an excuse to do that.

105
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,200
So I'll tell you about those as well.

106
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,480
But we got to start things off with some community news.

107
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,120
You know how we do, Wes.

108
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,780
There was, I feel like a psychological thriller

109
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,880
being played out by Red Hat against Linux users,

110
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,160
like teasing us, tugging on our strings,

111
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,240
telling us that a new logo was coming.

112
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,860
And then it kind of landed, it sort of landed first

113
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,080
as a community contest to sort of prep everybody

114
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,760
that a logo change was coming.

115
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,560
Get your feet wet, kind of understand

116
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,600
that change is happening.

117
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,620
Don't be too scared.

118
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,960
And then you started seeing these posts on Reddit

119
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,360
and whatnot that was like, the new logo is coming.

120
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,280
What's it going to be like now that IBM has acquired Red Hat?

121
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,720
They're changing the logo.

122
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,840
Blue Hat, right?

123
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,960
Yeah, is the hat going blue?

124
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,000
And then we got the big announcement video

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,200
from Red Hat with the cool, hip Red Hat music,

126
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,600
showing the new logo in all these different contexts that

127
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,020
are so awesome with flashy colors and hip people.

128
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,480
How could you not love the new logo?

129
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,940
Ladies and gentlemen, the new Red Hat logo is a Red Hat.

130
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,600
Very controversial decision here.

131
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,920
Who saw that coming?

132
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,960
People seem to really miss Shadow Man, though.

133
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,520
Yeah, Shadow Man is gone.

134
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,800
That is the big difference.

135
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,720
There are some good reasons for that, though.

136
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,640
There were internal people whose entire job it

137
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,840
is to look after the Red Hat brand, of course.

138
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,960
And they ran polls to ask people what they thought

139
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,720
when they saw the Red Hat logo, and word just sinister

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,340
came up.

141
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,800
And it's kind of in the name, right?

142
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,280
Shadowy, Shadow Man.

143
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,280
So that was part of the thought process of getting rid of him.

144
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,380
Yeah, and I could absolutely see that being the case

145
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,160
with a team of marketers sitting around saying,

146
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,520
what is bad about our brand?

147
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,240
How can we change it and bring it to a more positive light?

148
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,680
But man, I really like the new logo.

149
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,280
You know what?

150
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,920
I do, too.

151
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,520
Yeah, I do, too.

152
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,320
I wasn't entirely convinced the first time I saw it.

153
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,680
So there's been this internal project

154
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,120
for, I don't know, the best part of a year, maybe longer,

155
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,600
called the Open Brand Project, where they've basically

156
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,720
crowdsourced this design from Red Hatters across the globe.

157
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,640
And as you can imagine, Red Hat is full of opinionated people.

158
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,520
So internal mailing lists have been lighting up

159
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,080
for many months about this.

160
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,680
And I can imagine.

161
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,820
Everybody giving their two penneth about it.

162
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,480
But I think they've done a great job.

163
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
I think it looks great.

164
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,280
I actually think it's the perfect move.

165
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,040
Because everybody's all worked up about,

166
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,200
oh, it's going to be a big change because of the IBM

167
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,880
influence and all of that.

168
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,400
And so psychologically, we were all prepared for a shock,

169
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,480
a totally new look.

170
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,720
And then Red Hat comes out.

171
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,000
They're like, nah, it's still a Red Hat.

172
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,960
Yeah, it kind of feels just like a refinement,

173
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,200
more of saying, yeah, let's continue our purpose.

174
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,000
And it obviously does play and fit in a little bit better

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,640
compared to all the competitors who play in their space

176
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,680
have similar logos.

177
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,120
I hope this reflects where Red Hat's going

178
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,800
after this whole acquisition, a refinement of what we've

179
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,720
known that is Red Hat.

180
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,520
We'll see.

181
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,880
You know, the thing about it is that this completely predates

182
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,360
anybody's knowledge of IBM.

183
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,240
I mean, Jim apparently only talked to IBM early last year.

184
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,440
And we, of course, only found out late last year.

185
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
And this open brand project's been in the works

186
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,800
for a lot longer than that.

187
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,680
So yep.

188
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,320
I agree.

189
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,840
I know.

190
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,160
Good point to make, though.

191
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
It should be said that I would really

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,440
like to have one of the 1995 logos on a shirt.

193
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,680
Yeah, that's funny.

194
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,760
You want the retro look.

195
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,320
Yeah, with the article we linked, and it's in the IRC.

196
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,820
So if you're hanging out with us there, you can check it out.

197
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,640
But it has their iterations from 95 to 99.

198
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,480
Yeah, the last logo change was in 1999, 20 years.

199
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,200
So I think it's about due, don't you?

200
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,000
Absolutely.

201
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,400
So is anything happening with the building topper?

202
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,360
Oh, you got to wonder.

203
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,240
They have to.

204
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,040
I mean, you got to do a unified look, right?

205
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,940
It's already changed.

206
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,320
There was a whole thing downtown.

207
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,280
You know, news stations, they had a banner.

208
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,200
They had this whole brown banner covering it up with cloth.

209
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,400
And they changed it about two weeks ago.

210
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,240
And journalists picked it up about a week later.

211
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,800
And the internal main list was going, well,

212
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,040
it took them a while to notice.

213
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,760
Well, you know.

214
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,200
And then they had a big ceremony yesterday

215
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,180
where they dropped a cloth off it,

216
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,560
and Jim had a selfie in front of it and all the rest of it.

217
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,200
But it lights up red at night.

218
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,600
How nice is that?

219
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
I like that, actually.

220
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,360
So for those listening that don't know,

221
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,300
Alex is a Red Hatter, so he has some.

222
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,000
So he's tracking this, you might say.

223
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,760
I live four miles from the tower, so it's pretty nice.

224
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,680
You think at that distance, you could almost hook up wirelessly.

225
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,320
I'll send the drone off.

226
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,040
Yeah.

227
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,960
Maybe not.

228
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,720
Maybe don't do that.

229
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,360
Well, I'm very, very happy to have Drew on board.

230
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,000
What's great about Drew is pretty much all

231
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,400
of the recent hires we've done have been from the community.

232
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,680
In the most cases, they're from long, long-established community

233
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,560
members, like Cheese has been a community member for 10 years.

234
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,280
How long had you been listening before you came up

235
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,520
for that barbecue many years ago?

236
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,760
Not quite that long, but definitely a couple of years.

237
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,120
Yeah, a couple of years.

238
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,160
Drew is sort of on the other end of that.

239
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,840
He's been a listener for about, what, five, six months, Drew?

240
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,080
A little longer, maybe six, seven.

241
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,560
But in that time frame, yeah.

242
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,120
So right around the Linux Academy acquisition time frame,

243
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:30,920
I would say, right?

244
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,160
Is that when you kind of started listening?

245
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,120
That's a good sign that he just started listening and then

246
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,320
was willing to come and work with us.

247
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,600
I know, I know.

248
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,480
It's pretty great.

249
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,880
And Drew has already gotten us hyped

250
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,040
to the next level about Reaper and recording

251
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,920
on Linux, which is perfect.

252
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,400
Because Wes and I have already been getting pretty excited.

253
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,840
We've been solving a lot of problems in the studio.

254
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,200
And Reaper has really kind of just

255
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,960
been proven to be a great choice for us.

256
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,080
And so to have Drew join us right

257
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,600
as we're kind of in that hype cycle

258
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
already has really kind of taken everybody's excitement

259
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,480
to the next level.

260
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,440
We're sharing tricks and showing each other tips.

261
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,240
And Drew's like blowing our minds with ways

262
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,360
to make Reaper even better.

263
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,480
All the time.

264
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,520
That's pretty good.

265
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,840
And I got a dark theme now for Reaper, so I'm pretty happy.

266
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,760
It looks very professional in here.

267
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,120
So Drew, it's great to have you.

268
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,760
I'm glad you're able to join us for this episode.

269
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,840
Because I know you're going to be traveling back home

270
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,360
pretty soon.

271
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,680
So the timing, it just kind of worked out.

272
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,440
Yeah, me too.

273
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,040
I'm really glad I was able to be here

274
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,720
for a show in the studio as my first show.

275
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,040
Oh, yeah, totally.

276
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,960
That's perfect.

277
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,000
And you're a long, long time desktop Linux user.

278
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,600
Yes.

279
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,200
How long?

280
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,600
About 19, 20 years.

281
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,200
Yeah.

282
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,160
And Fedora is your primary jam.

283
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,960
Although I believe right now on your laptop is Ubuntu 19.04.

284
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,440
Yeah, you know, like most of us, I'll

285
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,840
distro hop a little bit here and there

286
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,080
when something new comes out.

287
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,040
And you've got to have the shiny and see how it ticks.

288
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,400
But I'll probably be back on Fedora 30

289
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
by the end of the month.

290
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,800
It was actually Drew talking about his love for Fedora.

291
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,240
He was like, all right, I'm installing 30.

292
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,480
Yeah, you were just sitting down.

293
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
And I was impressed.

294
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
You got it set up before very long.

295
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,000
Dude.

296
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,200
Yeah, we'll talk about that.

297
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,360
I just, you know, I was like, OK,

298
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,200
I had a good run with Manjaro on the ThinkPad.

299
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,760
Now let's put 30 on there.

300
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,560
And I messaged Joe.

301
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,520
And I told Joe, I'm like, hey, Joe, I'm

302
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,840
going to go ahead and give XFCE on Fedora a spin.

303
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,960
And Joe's like, what'd you tell me, Joe?

304
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,720
What'd you say?

305
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,400
I said, I've never had great experiences with it

306
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,680
because it's a bit too stock.

307
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,480
It's a bit ugly and needs a bit of theming.

308
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,040
But it sounds like you're willing to do that work to theme

309
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,920
it and set it up exactly how you want it.

310
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Well, here's what I said is I said, I'll commit an evening.

311
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,840
If I can get the config and the setup nailed in an evening,

312
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,600
then I'll stick with it and I'll use it.

313
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,080
And I attempted to do just that.

314
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,680
So I'll tell you about how that went

315
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,280
and what I ended up with here in just a little bit.

316
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,480
Well, maybe we'll just do a little more community news

317
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
before we get there.

318
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,720
I think this is pretty exciting.

319
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,040
Dell is launching a couple of new Linux-loaded machines,

320
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,880
a Precision 3540 laptop that starts at $700 as well

321
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,320
as some other systems.

322
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,040
You still have that new Dell XPS 9380 developer edition.

323
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,560
It's a beauty, has a lot of performance.

324
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,120
But if the price is too much for you,

325
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
Dell has launched their new budget mobile Precision laptop

326
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,040
now with Linux options on there.

327
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,920
Oh, yeah, the 3540.

328
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,120
Now, it starts at just $702 American.

329
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,560
I know, you get a Core i5, UHD Graphics 620,

330
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,400
and unfortunately, a whopping 15-inch 1366 by 768 display.

331
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,800
Also, that comes with 4 gigs of RAM and a 500-gig hard drive.

332
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,480
Now, that doesn't sound great, but you can upgrade $700

333
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,240
as a bottom.

334
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,760
As a starting.

335
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,680
It's not that bad.

336
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah, that means when you've configured it

337
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,620
the way you want it, you're not breaking the bank.

338
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,400
So there's that.

339
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,720
Also, I have some family members,

340
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,680
like my dad, who cites it's OK, but it's

341
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,840
starting to go a little bit for reading fine print on screens.

342
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,720
So some of these resolutions for him.

343
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
That might just be fun.

344
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,560
Big text, it's good.

345
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,960
He actually doesn't mind at all.

346
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,960
The savings isn't huge over the Windows 10 edition.

347
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,720
You save about $67 US greenbacks by going

348
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,960
with Ubuntu over Windows 10.

349
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,120
Now, if you're skeptical of the 3540 coming out later

350
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,440
this month, there's going to be the 3541.

351
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,880
That's going to have some nicer options, including a Xeon

352
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,160
processor or Nvidia Quadro Graphics.

353
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,480
Now, both of these ship with 1804,

354
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,400
but they're also certified for RHEL 8.

355
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,280
Isn't that interesting?

356
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,760
Isn't that interesting?

357
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,440
Well, tip of the hat there to Barton George and his team

358
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,000
there at Dell.

359
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,400
That's awesome to see another update coming out.

360
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Perhaps we'll hear more about that very soon from them.

361
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,120
Kind of along those same lines, speaking of Ubuntu,

362
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,840
Canonical has released WLCS.

363
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,000
Any guesses what WLCS stands for?

364
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,080
You have a guess?

365
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,560
Well, I happen to already know.

366
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,360
I know you know.

367
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,440
That's not a fair question.

368
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,760
All right.

369
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,240
All right.

370
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,400
It is the Wayland Conformance Suite.

371
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,120
Now, Ubuntu, as you know, is not currently

372
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,380
using Wayland by default. And it doesn't

373
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,760
look like they're even going to give that a shot again

374
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,600
until Ubuntu 2010.

375
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,880
The option is, of course, still available if you want to give

376
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,000
it a go-skis.

377
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,720
And they're working to set up a compliance suite.

378
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,560
I guess that's like a suite of testing to validate?

379
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,040
Yeah.

380
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,920
Well, I mean, what do we always say about Wayland?

381
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,600
It's the protocol, not the implementation.

382
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,480
It's not a display server.

383
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:17,880
It's a protocol.

384
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Yeah.

385
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,720
And so it makes sense to be able to test

386
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,160
that things implement that protocol in a standard way.

387
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,720
So you can have multiple implementations,

388
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,600
test them against each other, and test them

389
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,080
against a standard battery of tests.

390
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,000
That does make sense.

391
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,480
So as part of their Wayland interests

392
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,680
and as part of developing the mirror, now with Wayland

393
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,080
support, they've been working on this Wayland Conformance

394
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,120
Suite for testing the Wayland protocols for the conformance

395
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,160
to the written specifications for Wayland.

396
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,320
Now, basically, as I said, it's just

397
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,520
ensuring Wayland compositors behave correctly

398
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,720
against all of the documented specifications

399
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,640
for the protocols.

400
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,080
Now, just this morning, canonical developer Chris

401
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,040
Rogers released the Wayland Conformance Suite 1.0,

402
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,760
and that's why we're talking about it today.

403
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,600
In its current state, there are about 300 tests

404
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,760
to vet Wayland surface events, the Wayland shell protocol,

405
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,480
XDG shell, and a few other things.

406
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,720
Yeah, OK.

407
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,440
I like that.

408
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,360
That's a great idea.

409
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,880
It is, right?

410
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,400
And it's a good example of different interests

411
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,800
working together on some common software that

412
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,560
helps everyone using Wayland.

413
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,320
I happen to also know the developer that's

414
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,000
responsible for some of this.

415
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,320
Chris is a genius, a genius.

416
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,340
This is a brilliant mind that is doing incredible development,

417
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,920
and it's great that Canonical is now

418
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,400
paying him to contribute that towards Wayland

419
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,240
and making it possible to adopt Wayland.

420
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,760
Yeah, right.

421
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,120
This is going to benefit the entire community.

422
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,080
All right.

423
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,560
Now we have something we want to ask the audience.

424
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,480
I bought a Nintendo Switch a while ago

425
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,720
with the intention of putting Linux on it,

426
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,440
but then there's a problem, Wes.

427
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,200
I turned out to love the Switch.

428
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,080
I mean, it is an excellent game playing device,

429
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,440
so I can see how that might happen.

430
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,320
Have you had a chance to try one?

431
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,480
Yeah.

432
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,440
I don't own one, although I have been tempted to purchase one,

433
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,760
but I've played it at friends, and it's great.

434
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,480
Drew, have you had a chance to try one?

435
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,440
I actually haven't ever really played one.

436
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,280
You're going to have to let them.

437
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,120
I mean, do you have it here with you?

438
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,640
Yeah, I did.

439
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,800
Yeah, I always.

440
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,360
I was very skeptical, because it seemed just

441
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,280
like a rip-off tablet.

442
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
They were sticking some controllers via Bluetooth

443
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,080
on and having, essentially, a Nintendo label badged on it.

444
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
I was wrong about that.

445
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,200
It's a great gaming device, and so I haven't really

446
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,320
taken the plunge to try to put Linux on it yet.

447
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,440
Right, and you've just been satisfied

448
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,320
in its current role.

449
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,880
However, things may be changing, Wes.

450
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,200
I got to get a push from the audience.

451
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,160
I don't want to break my Switch without at least knowing

452
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,880
that the audience wants to know how this works.

453
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,240
So if you would like me to Linux my Switch,

454
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,840
I want you to tweet me at ChrisLAS

455
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,680
or ping me in the Telegram channel,

456
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,520
hashtag Linux the Switch, hashtag Linux the Switch.

457
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,640
Let me know if you want us to attempt

458
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,800
to put Linux on my Nintendo Switch,

459
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,520
because Wes and I are going to need to 3D print

460
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,120
a component to do this.

461
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,720
It's a little involved, could break the Switch.

462
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,920
Who knows, or get you banned.

463
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,600
But we would be using L4T Ubuntu, a friendly Linux

464
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,200
distro for your Switch.

465
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,920
It sounds like it's, I mean, as they call it,

466
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,320
quote unquote, fully featured.

467
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,120
Dock support, Bluetooth, NVIDIA drivers for the GPU, audio,

468
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,000
the Joy-Cons work.

469
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,560
Not if you connect them directly,

470
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,520
but they work when they're remotely connected.

471
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,240
I don't know why that's the case, but it just is.

472
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,800
Wi-Fi display, touch screen, CPU frequency scaling,

473
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,200
so it sounds like the battery life might actually be OK.

474
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,600
Yeah.

475
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,120
And even video accelerated playback.

476
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,800
That's not bad.

477
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,400
It might actually be a useful device.

478
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:39,800
I don't know.

479
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
We haven't tried it yet.

480
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,080
You know what the killer use case for that would be?

481
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,360
Is running, if they have any built for that processor,

482
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,160
would be running emulators to play the Super Nintendo

483
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,160
on my Switch.

484
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,120
All right, let me know.

485
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,440
Hashtag Linux the Switch if you want us to try this.

486
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,560
I'll 3D print the thing for you if you want.

487
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,080
Awesome.

488
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,800
There we go.

489
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,840
Now we've got the hookup.

490
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,800
And I think the first thing you should test is,

491
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,040
will it run Doom?

492
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,920
Yes, of course.

493
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,600
Crisis, dude.

494
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,080
It's got to run crisis.

495
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,800
There you go.

496
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,240
Chris, I think you need a burner switch is what you need.

497
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,720
You need a good switch and a burner switch.

498
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,320
You're right.

499
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,200
The best of both worlds.

500
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,600
You're right.

501
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,960
I need another switch, of course.

502
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,960
For show purposes.

503
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,160
For show purposes.

504
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,600
So what I should do then is strategically wait,

505
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,920
because the rumor is there's going

506
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,080
to be different sized switches, like a Switch XL coming out.

507
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,640
So I get the Switch XL for myself,

508
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,760
and then I dedicate the current Switch

509
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,800
that is hackable to the show.

510
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,520
I mean, it's the right thing to do.

511
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,800
All right, a little housekeeping before we keep going.

512
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,200
Not much this week.

513
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,080
However, we promised it, and we are

514
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,480
beginning to deliver right now.

515
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,320
We have started to post the audio for the LinuxFest

516
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,640
Northwest talks.

517
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,840
You're working on it right now.

518
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,560
I take it.

519
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,680
Yes, absolutely.

520
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,880
There might be something preventing us from doing that,

521
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,440
but it'll be up in just a moment.

522
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,640
Well, the issue is we're trying to upload like 90 megabyte flack

523
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,240
files to GitHub, which is not designed

524
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,760
to hold 90 meg flack files.

525
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,120
But it's happening anyway.

526
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,160
We're going to get it to work, you think?

527
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,800
Oh, yeah, of course.

528
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,640
All right, I'll put a link in the show notes.

529
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,520
It's github.com slash jupyterbroadcasting slash talks.

530
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,920
We have the audio up right now.

531
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,960
As folks that were involved submit their talks to us,

532
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,800
either the slides for like a link to it,

533
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,360
or the PDF of it, or something like that,

534
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,000
we will add those to the GitHub as well.

535
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,700
So you can download the audio, and then

536
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,620
follow along at your own pace with the slides.

537
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,120
Yeah, ideally one place to find all those things.

538
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,800
Yeah, and I plan to do this with future talks, too.

539
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,480
So keep that jupyterbroadcasting slash talks directory

540
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,960
bookmarked, because we'll probably

541
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,400
have more in the future, I think.

542
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Right now, we'll start with Linux Fest Northwest.

543
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,280
So that's github.com slash jupyterbroadcasting slash talks

544
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,760
to find those.

545
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,120
To get the audio and the slides, you can find it all up

546
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,740
in that business.

547
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,760
Now, only one other thing to talk about in the housekeeping,

548
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,520
probably the most important thing, the Friday stream.

549
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,080
Join us.

550
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,840
We'll be back from Red Hat Summit,

551
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,760
and we'll be doing a special back from Boston Friday

552
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,280
stream.

553
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,400
It's going to be a big one.

554
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,840
And up on YouTube right now is the Linux Fest Northwest

555
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,240
pre-party Friday, the family reunion edition.

556
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,160
That's what I call it.

557
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,120
It's a family reunion.

558
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,840
That's adorable.

559
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,540
It really was.

560
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,600
And that's up on YouTube right now,

561
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,080
youtube.com slash jupyterbroadcasting.

562
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,640
And the rumor has it there may soon be a dedicated Friday

563
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,200
stream feed.

564
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
What day is that on, though?

565
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,720
I'm not sure.

566
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,600
I think it might be on Fridays.

567
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,680
Might be on Friday.

568
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,480
Such a troll.

569
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,380
It's on Friday.

570
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,240
It's Friday.

571
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:32,920
It's on Friday.

572
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,680
Yeah, so the thing about the Friday stream

573
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,720
is we have a great crew here now.

574
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,600
And I just wanted to give the audience a chance

575
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,280
to meet the crew, just share stories, kind of just

576
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,920
build relationships with the audience and the crew.

577
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,640
And that's what the Friday stream is about.

578
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,920
So I'm a little more casual, and we

579
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,480
can dive into the diverse number of topics that don't always

580
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,720
make it to the other shows.

581
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,260
Yeah, we often will have in-jokes

582
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,080
that we reference or things of that nature.

583
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,880
And you'll hear the history, and you'll

584
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,400
learn about those in the Friday stream,

585
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,520
as well as, at least for now, a recap of some of the shows.

586
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,100
And we'll play some clips of the shows

587
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,600
and expand on them and follow up a little bit.

588
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,720
It's just a ton of fun.

589
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,280
So check that out, jblive.tv on Fridays,

590
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,000
jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

591
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,960
to get it in your local time zone, as always, as always.

592
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,040
And there you have it.

593
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,720
That's it right there.

594
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,560
That is the extent of the housekeeping, nice and short.

595
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,400
Get it out of here.

596
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,520
Get it out of here.

597
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,280
All right, Fedora 30 has been released.

598
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,040
We've had a bit of fun with it over the last few days.

599
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,680
And I walked away with a pretty great setup.

600
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,000
So I thought, let's sit down here

601
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,620
and talk about it a little bit.

602
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,400
Now, you have, Wes, a very unique configuration.

603
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,920
Perhaps you could describe this as the high performance

604
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,840
Fedora 30 setup.

605
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,540
Yeah, that's right.

606
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,740
I mean, I'm once again running it

607
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,280
out of that persistent memory device,

608
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,880
because it's just so easy and at hand.

609
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,840
You say it casually, like everybody just

610
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,440
knows what you're talking about.

611
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,480
It actually does take a lot of fiddling, too.

612
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,440
So for those of you that have missed the Friday

613
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,640
stream or Coder Radio, one of the ways

614
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,800
that Wes likes to try out software,

615
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,160
you know, if it's just a quick go,

616
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,080
is to build an entire environment in persistent RAM,

617
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,280
which is a funny term to begin with, persistent RAM.

618
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,680
Yeah, and it's not real persistent RAM.

619
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,880
Not a few, not a sheet power off.

620
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
It's just emulated, yeah.

621
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,000
But as long as you keep your laptop on, as I generally do,

622
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
it works just fine.

623
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,440
So I can boot into it, or right now, as we're doing the show,

624
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,200
I just have it running in a virtual machine,

625
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
but out of the same device.

626
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Oh.

627
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,640
So actually, I just set it up using the virtual machine,

628
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:29,880
right?

629
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,600
Go click through it there while I keep my original OS running.

630
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,760
And then once it's all set up, reboot it.

631
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,200
And then you Kexec into the environment that runs in RAM?

632
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,480
Yeah.

633
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,560
And as long as you don't reboot, you can also add it.

634
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,440
Or you can reboot.

635
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,480
You just can't shut down for a period of time, really.

636
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,760
Kexec is faster and works well, too.

637
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,400
So I do that.

638
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,160
But you can actually just add it to your grub entry.

639
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:49,920
Reboot.

640
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,440
As long as your machine's not kind of slow,

641
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,720
this might vary per machine.

642
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,560
But on everything I've tried it with, it works pretty reliably.

643
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,000
You can just add it to the grub menu

644
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,800
and then have another OS installed that's

645
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,440
actually just stuck in RAM.

646
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,280
So does it load a base OS, initialize the RAM,

647
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,040
load the OS in the memory, and then boot it?

648
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,200
Well, it basically is just another device, right?

649
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,760
So you need to make sure you add an additional module

650
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,380
unless your kernel actually includes it.

651
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,960
Most of the time, it's a separate module

652
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,920
that you have to load.

653
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,400
So it's the same kernel as the host op, the main OS installed?

654
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,160
Yeah, well, I'm using the Fedora kernel.

655
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,880
Ah, OK.

656
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,480
Yeah, it's just like a new device existing on my system.

657
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,200
It just happens to actually be a reserved block of memory.

658
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,440
So there is some trickiness.

659
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,240
You have to go customize things and make sure,

660
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,280
depending on how your init RAMFS is built,

661
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,440
different systems, like Drawcut for Fedora, for instance,

662
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,440
go add the additional modules you might need

663
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,440
or build a custom kernel if that's your preferred route.

664
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,400
Then you can add that, either use Kexec

665
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,960
or add it to your grub menu.

666
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,580
Away you go.

667
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,800
So when you're installing and you're

668
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,960
going through the Anaconda installer,

669
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,800
what does the disk partitioner see?

670
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,340
Since I did it in a virtual machine,

671
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,560
it just saw a normal disk.

672
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,720
Ah, OK.

673
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,880
Yeah, so it set up LVM like normal.

674
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,080
I just did the plain default Fedora install.

675
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,840
That's so cool.

676
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,720
And then you turn around and load that into RAM.

677
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,120
And then it was already, yeah.

678
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,920
You set up the RAM disk, you boot up,

679
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,680
you have to add a kernel command line parameter that

680
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,440
reserves the RAM and makes it appear

681
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,600
as a device to the system.

682
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,480
Right, OK.

683
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,560
Yeah, and then I just pointed VirtualBox at it

684
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,040
and set it up like normal.

685
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,320
I love how nonchalantly you describe that,

686
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,780
as if it's just something that you casually did.

687
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,200
And I'm sitting here like an animal

688
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,620
running it on physical hardware, like some sort of jerk.

689
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,220
So as a result of that, I had to get a little nitty-gritty

690
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,480
with some of the grub configuration for Fedora.

691
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,560
I was poking around there.

692
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,280
And I noticed one of the changes that they made,

693
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,240
which is this new grub plugin, it

694
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,200
follows the bootloader spec style of configuration.

695
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
So now there's a separate, maybe if you've

696
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,160
used systemd boot sort of stuff, you're

697
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
familiar with this style.

698
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,760
Instead of under the grub config folder,

699
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,520
it's under the loaders folder.

700
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,600
And it's a simpler setup.

701
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,120
It's just sort of like each line is setting something,

702
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,280
like here's the kernel you're using,

703
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,160
here's the initRAMFS you're using,

704
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,600
any arguments that actually just inherit whatever default

705
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,180
arguments are being passed down.

706
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,640
And that way, instead of having to customize the grub2

707
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,200
configuration, which if any of you out there know

708
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,160
is full featured but a bit complicated to use,

709
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,280
you can easily define multiple entries.

710
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,840
And I think it's going to be a little more resilient

711
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,520
because it does it at boot time.

712
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,000
So you're not relying on this fully bootable host

713
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
OS to be able to regenerate all the grub.

714
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,840
We've all had to chroot in, go update grub.

715
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,480
Yeah, if it's just down to some configuration parameters

716
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,800
or something, it just lives on the thing.

717
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,760
And when grub starts, it loads this module,

718
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,240
which reads these entries and generates grub entries.

719
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,280
That's fancy.

720
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,560
I like that.

721
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,680
Nice deep dive there.

722
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,960
Thank you.

723
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,680
The other thing that I think both you and I were really

724
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,080
looking forward to in this release

725
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,360
is the flicker-free boot.

726
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,680
What do you think of that so far?

727
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,640
So far, it's pretty shiny, at least in my experiment.

728
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,040
Yeah, mine has not had flicker-free boot.

729
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,960
And I think in part it's because I'm using XFCE

730
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,080
and I'm not using Wayland.

731
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,840
And you're probably using Wayland, Gnome Shell.

732
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,880
It is really nice.

733
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,960
It is nice.

734
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,760
But I also would be 100% happy just always looking

735
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,320
at the text output of the boot.

736
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,400
Since day one, since the very, very, very, very first moment

737
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,160
I ever tried Linux, one of the first impressions I had

738
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,120
was that boot text flying across the screen

739
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,680
telling me what my computer was actually doing.

740
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,040
And from that very first moment, I've loved it.

741
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,320
And I often will just clear the boot screen.

742
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,360
Yeah, usually, actually, I just said we're both.

743
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,480
So anyway, even if it has a nice boot screen.

744
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,720
Generally, I just leave it until the next time I

745
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,160
have a reason to go into grub.

746
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,440
And then when I'm in there editing the menu entry,

747
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,040
I'll just take it out and I'm like, ah, let's do this now.

748
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,880
While I'm in here.

749
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,440
But Flickr Free Boot is one of the new features

750
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,920
that people are talking a lot about.

751
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,520
Bash 5.0 also shipping in this SOB.

752
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Big update to Python in this, as well as GCC 9.

753
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:58,120
And of course, last but absolutely not least, Gnome 3.32.

754
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,040
Of course.

755
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,960
I think it's not an exaggeration to say the absolute best

756
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,400
release of Gnome Shell that's ever been released.

757
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,900
I really can't argue with that, right?

758
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,660
I mean, it just feels like a good, solid gnome.

759
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,680
It's fast.

760
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,520
It's been polished up a little bit.

761
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,240
It feels like Gnome 3 has what it was meant to be.

762
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,760
Yeah, and I'll say this.

763
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,920
It's made things awkward for guys like me

764
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,820
that want to kind of keep one toe in the Gnome Shell world

765
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,520
now.

766
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
It really means I'm in a position

767
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,160
where I have to run a cutting edge distro.

768
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,840
I'm either on Fedora 30 or Ubuntu 19.04 right now.

769
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,240
Old Gnome won't cut it anymore.

770
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,740
Right.

771
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,080
Well, if I want the latest and greatest Gnome memory

772
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,560
improvements, if I want the latest performance fixes

773
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,120
and the latest stability additions and improvements,

774
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,520
I've got to be running on a later distribution.

775
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,320
No more LTS for me if I want Gnome Shell.

776
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,000
That's an interesting position to be in.

777
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,400
And I would argue that if you're a big Gnome Shell user,

778
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,120
the new additions and improvements to Gnome,

779
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,880
or Gnome 3.32, are kind of worth upgrading.

780
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,320
Thankfully, this will just be solved.

781
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,680
Wait a little while, and next releases

782
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,920
will have the good stuff.

783
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:10,840
So I said, no, I will not be subject to this rat race.

784
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,760
I will not be subject to this.

785
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,120
And I had an epiphany.

786
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,000
Talking to Drew, it hit me.

787
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,200
I could have the perfect stack, a ThinkPad hardware,

788
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,680
a clean, simple Fedora 30 installation base,

789
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,880
and the XFCE desktop on top of it.

790
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,080
Think about that just from a high level standpoint,

791
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,960
how clean, simple, and efficient that sounds.

792
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,080
It's appealing.

793
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,720
Drew, what is it about Fedora that's

794
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,840
drewing you in over the years?

795
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,920
You see what I did there.

796
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,560
What I like about Fedora is that I really understand

797
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,280
and like how simplified the base OS is.

798
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,160
I never get confused going through trying to figure out

799
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,600
where stuff is because, for example, they've already

800
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,120
solved the slash user slash bin issues,

801
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,480
and they've really kind of tidied up the OS in a way

802
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,880
that really I love.

803
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,240
On top of that, it's modern, and working with flat packs

804
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,040
makes it a really nice distribution to use.

805
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,760
Now, you can run into some issues

806
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
if you're trying to run snaps since you

807
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,040
have to go SE Linux permissive if you want to run snaps,

808
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,480
which I don't do SE Linux permissive.

809
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,640
I came from the MSP world.

810
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,240
Security was one of the things that I did, and yeah.

811
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,440
So no snaps for me.

812
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,760
And that is another thing we don't often talk about Fedora,

813
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,760
but I mean, SE Linux is just right there for you

814
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,800
if you do have that background or you do have those concerns.

815
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,600
Right, and I prefer that to App Armor.

816
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,800
I also tend to prefer Firewall D to UFW.

817
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,120
I find both App Armor and UFW, I just

818
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,240
don't, it might just be that I haven't spent enough time

819
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,480
with them, but they feel clunky to me.

820
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,600
And I know that part of that is from my background of coming

821
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,400
from things like doing network engineering,

822
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,720
Firewall D makes a little more sense.

823
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,240
It's better for people like me who

824
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,080
come from that world without a major transition into the way

825
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,880
UFW does it and tries to simplify things and automate

826
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,200
a lot of the processes through apt and apt scripts

827
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,040
when you go to install something,

828
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,120
automatically opening up your Firewall port.

829
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,400
Right, whereas you already know how to do those things.

830
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,560
You're comfortable managing that yourself,

831
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,280
and Firewall D lets you do that.

832
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,120
And now that said, I'm not installing Fedora

833
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,160
on my wife's laptop.

834
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,440
She's getting Ubuntu because it's

835
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,600
easier for somebody who's a little less technically

836
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,200
inclined to really wrap their brain around.

837
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,800
I'm a little curious, as a longtime Fedora user,

838
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,240
how you feel about just the update and support cycle,

839
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
especially if you're using it on maybe something

840
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,760
more like a workstation.

841
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,320
Sure.

842
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,600
Well, I always tend to kind of stay up to date.

843
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,080
But then again, that's because I typically know how to fix

844
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,320
things when they break.

845
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,880
I also feel a little more confident.

846
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,280
You and I were talking about this,

847
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,000
using DNF to do those upgrades, because it's

848
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,200
a very implicit process that you go through,

849
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,160
and then it does essentially a preflight check

850
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,360
before it does the upgrade.

851
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,120
I love that.

852
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,720
DNF just feels robust and well-designed.

853
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,400
Yeah.

854
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,600
And that one, you could see how Drew sucked me back

855
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,240
into using Fedora.

856
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Absolutely.

857
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,080
And then I'm like, OK, well, let's try

858
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,320
this ultimate stack.

859
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,120
So I got my ThinkPad going with Fedora 30 on there.

860
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,520
Here's what I found interesting is

861
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,800
Joe's concern was that it would be quite a bit of work

862
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,480
to get it set up.

863
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,680
And Joe, you were kind of half right.

864
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,800
Here's what I was surprised by.

865
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,320
A couple of things were pre-installed

866
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,840
that make it a lot simpler to use XFCE.

867
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,000
Number one, the whisker menu, a current version

868
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,560
of the whisker menu, is installed.

869
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,320
It's just not in the menu by default.

870
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,240
So you have to go hunting for it if you want it.

871
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,720
You can kill the existing menu, right click on the panel,

872
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,620
add item, add whisker menu, good to go.

873
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,040
That's all it takes.

874
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,400
Also, happy to report, the arc and arc dark themes

875
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,780
are pre-installed.

876
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:16,520
It's using Edwadia by default, and it looks a little rough,

877
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,340
especially with that new background.

878
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,200
The colors, it's just all, it's a little 1990s.

879
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,880
It's like the most stereotypical XFCE first impression.

880
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,420
I don't hate it, but that just might

881
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,880
be because I used to use it looking exactly like that.

882
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,580
So I have a nostalgic love.

883
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,080
So I went and flipped that thing over to arc dark

884
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,960
in about 3.7 seconds, and then went and downloaded the pop OS

885
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,640
icons, installed them, good to go.

886
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,560
Pretty much everything I wanted, Slack, Telegram,

887
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,440
was all available as a flat pack.

888
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,040
I quickly.

889
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,240
You mean all that proprietary software?

890
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,760
Yeah.

891
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,680
And the other thing I was happy to report, it's not flawless,

892
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:59,480
but it was just a quick DNF install gnome-software.

893
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,880
And I had the whole gnome software downloaded

894
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,960
and installed, which made it really easy

895
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,700
to add the Chrome repository and a bunch of other things

896
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,220
like proprietary drivers, codecs like the Cisco H.264 codec,

897
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,640
as well as download and install updates

898
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,400
and search for applications.

899
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,600
I wouldn't say the integration with gnome software and XFCE

900
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,160
is all that good, but it's functional.

901
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
See, this is impressive.

902
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,840
I'm just thinking back to the last days.

903
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,560
And what do you guys always say?

904
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,880
You got to wait a little while after a Fedora release

905
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,880
because some of those alternative repos,

906
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,240
other things, proprietary app support,

907
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,600
they might just not be online.

908
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,640
But here you go, not very long after the release.

909
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,240
I mean, flat packs.

910
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,320
And COPR is now making it so easy for people

911
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,520
to update to the next release.

912
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,120
It's a checkbox to build for the next.

913
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,200
I mean, it's great.

914
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,000
You're right, Drew.

915
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,080
And Wes, you're right.

916
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,000
This is not something that should be missed here.

917
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,600
This is week one of Fedora 30.

918
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,120
And I'm up and working with all of the applications I need.

919
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,320
Granted, it's Intel.

920
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,320
It's Intel hardware.

921
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,760
It's Intel video.

922
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,880
But I've got literally every application

923
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,680
I need to do my job.

924
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,160
I saw you sit down and configure basically the whole thing.

925
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,080
In like 15 minutes.

926
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,240
It did not take very long.

927
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,820
And the great thing about Anaconda,

928
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,440
because you're answering a bunch of questions like time zone

929
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,480
and user and root password and all that in keyboard layout,

930
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,800
you're answering all of that while it's writing the images

931
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,400
to disk.

932
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,740
So by the time you get done answering all of those things,

933
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,160
you're like at 80% installed.

934
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,320
And you just sit back for like three minutes.

935
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,240
And then another 15 minutes after that,

936
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,760
I had a fully configured XFCE desktop

937
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,480
that I am genuinely happy with.

938
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,440
It's just great from top to bottom,

939
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,440
from the hardware, which runs cooler now, the battery

940
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,560
life, which is better.

941
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,840
I got two days.

942
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,280
I'm not even shitting you.

943
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,360
I got two days of battery life at Linux Fest Northwest.

944
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,040
Recording audio, right?

945
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
So it's not just like my laptop was sitting there.

946
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,760
Actually, it's doing some work shuffling bytes around.

947
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,560
I have the screen set to about 25%, 30%

948
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:03,200
running Fedora 30 XFCE Audacity recording from a USB audio

949
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,580
interface for two days straight on one battery charge.

950
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,240
So the battery life is phenomenal.

951
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,640
The machine runs cooler.

952
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,760
The Fedora install is clean and simple.

953
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,600
And XFCE is light and efficient.

954
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,320
It's a brilliant setup.

955
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,880
All right, what's wrong with it?

956
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,480
Well, if you have a high DPI monitor,

957
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,780
it's not going to work for you.

958
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:26,560
That's probably the biggest flaw with my setup right now.

959
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,560
That's really it, is that XFCE really

960
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,680
falls down with high DPI, where Gnome Shell shines.

961
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,600
And if you have a high DPI display,

962
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,800
it's sort of a deal breaker.

963
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,880
I think that's the biggest drawback right now.

964
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,460
And didn't you have a default browser issue as well?

965
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:39,960
I did.

966
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,460
Oh, yeah.

967
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:40,960
Thank you.

968
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,200
I also had a, I can't, I think I did fix this now.

969
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,120
But I had an issue.

970
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,360
Even though I installed Chrome, every link

971
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,720
I would click from any application in XFCE

972
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,040
would launch Firefox.

973
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,320
That's a little bit frustrating.

974
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,080
Even in the preferred applications, I had Chrome set.

975
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080
You were kind of watching you wander around,

976
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,160
like I set it over here, I set it over here.

977
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,520
I changed the mime types to point to Chrome.

978
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,120
I went all in.

979
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,160
And I think I eventually, it was something like change

980
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,720
alternatives.

981
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,520
I can't remember now.

982
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,200
Update alternatives.

983
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,000
Update alternatives.

984
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,560
That's what it was.

985
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,020
And I think that finally fixed it.

986
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,680
But there was a bit of hunting and pecking and solving

987
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,280
that I did not have to do with Subuntu

988
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,040
that I had to do on the Fedora side.

989
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,240
But it was all within about a 15, 20 minute window.

990
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,720
And I was prepared to spend an evening.

991
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
So that's not so bad.

992
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,320
And hey, you know how it works now.

993
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,440
I'll tell you what.

994
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,160
I was looking at some of the different spins of Fedora.

995
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,440
And one name keeps popping up on these a lot.

996
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,040
It's Niels.

997
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,820
But there was a few I looked at.

998
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,600
I wanted to give a special mention to two,

999
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,600
the Fedora Security Lab, which is pretty neat.

1000
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,040
I loaded that in a VM and gave it a go.

1001
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,520
It's like you would expect.

1002
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,540
It is a version of Fedora loaded with a bunch of security tools

1003
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,920
and scripts to do network penetration testing and whatnot.

1004
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,240
And it's a really cool addition.

1005
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,240
Security Lab, we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

1006
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,280
I also tried out, because I wanted to compare it

1007
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,360
to the XFCE desktop, I tried out the LXQt spin of Fedora.

1008
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,160
And it's also very fast, very lightweight.

1009
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,840
It's really, really great.

1010
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,120
I prefer GTK applications a little bit.

1011
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,160
So XFCE is kind of the way I went.

1012
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,680
But this was a great spin.

1013
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,360
But before we get to Silverblue, which

1014
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,280
I think is what we all need to talk about here

1015
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,360
while we're talking Fedora 30, I think

1016
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,000
we should talk a little bit about some of these other spins,

1017
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,640
like the Pantheon edition.

1018
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,120
It's not officially a spin yet, but you can install it,

1019
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,160
as well as a few others.

1020
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,120
And Neil, your name's all over these things when I look at it.

1021
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,440
What is your hot take right now on Fedora 30?

1022
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,240
And a disclaimer, Neil is a contributor

1023
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,440
to Fedora, as well as just about every other project

1024
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,600
on the freaking planet.

1025
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,480
But a big contributor, Fedora.

1026
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,840
So Neil, what do you think about the new Pantheon

1027
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,680
packages that are installable and the other spins

1028
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,120
that are out there?

1029
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,680
What's your hot take, as it were?

1030
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,320
Well, I'm actually really excited.

1031
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,560
So for the Pantheon desktop, we started this work

1032
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,920
with Fabio Valentini, who is the main driver and main

1033
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,560
contributor to all of this stuff.

1034
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,200
He was doing this back in Fedora 25, 26

1035
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,520
when we started this.

1036
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,160
And over the course of the last few Fedora releases,

1037
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,920
we've just been bulking it up and getting

1038
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,560
the basic environment up and going.

1039
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,480
And it's just been pretty awesome.

1040
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,000
We worked with the elementary OS people

1041
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,800
to fix issues that cropped up.

1042
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,360
We made it a little bit more portable.

1043
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,280
We've contributed things all over the place.

1044
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,520
What was the reception from the elementary OS project?

1045
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,160
How did they feel about you doing this?

1046
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,880
So initially, they were kind of cool to it.

1047
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,760
But when we started showing up and providing suggestions,

1048
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,200
patches, and actually legit feedback

1049
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,480
that not only benefited us in the Fedora side,

1050
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,040
but also helping them to make their elementary OS better,

1051
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,680
they warmed up pretty quickly to that.

1052
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,440
And we've got a fair number of advocates

1053
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,080
within the elementary OS team who like the stuff that we do.

1054
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,880
And so they're huge fans.

1055
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,680
That's awesome.

1056
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,720
Yeah, in particular, I want to give a shout out

1057
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,480
to Cody Garver, who's the quote unquote system

1058
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,720
architect for elementary OS.

1059
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,480
He and I have been working closely together

1060
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,640
for a couple of years now, along with Fabio,

1061
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,240
working on getting all those pieces in place.

1062
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,480
And now he manages actually the infrastructure

1063
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,040
for producing elementary OS, all the distro patching,

1064
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,880
the releasing of all the applications,

1065
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,800
and things like that.

1066
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,560
And so we worked with him to make sure

1067
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,600
that whatever we needed to do to get things fixed

1068
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,080
would also work OK on elementary OS's side,

1069
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:28,520
and generally benefit both of us as a whole.

1070
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,800
If I wasn't being too presumptuous, I could say,

1071
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,920
Fedora's Pantheon desktop is, barring a few things that

1072
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,080
are kind of missing due to some quirks and other problems,

1073
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:45,280
is actually about the same level in terms of integration

1074
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,800
and polish as what elementary OS was, or is.

1075
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,320
That does seem like a bold statement, my friend.

1076
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,960
Part of that is being a little bit presumptuous in the sense

1077
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,360
that it's not complete.

1078
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,000
It doesn't have all the pieces that the elementary OS

1079
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,320
experience offers.

1080
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,120
For example, unfortunately, App Center

1081
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,920
had to be removed for Fedora 30.

1082
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,260
There were a bunch of things that

1083
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,360
just kind of broke to the point that we needed to pull it out.

1084
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,200
It'll be reintroduced later in the Fedora 30 lifecycle.

1085
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,000
There'll be a few other things that we're still working on

1086
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,240
and chewing through to try to fix.

1087
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,000
But it's the most complete experience we've had in a while.

1088
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,440
The fact that elementary OS is introducing flat pack support

1089
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,280
in the near future will actually make things a little bit more

1090
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,600
interesting for us.

1091
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:36,360
There is an old-ish branch somewhere of App Center

1092
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,720
with Snap support as well.

1093
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,840
And as you may be aware, I am the Snap maintainer for Fedora.

1094
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,560
And I have all the integration pieces in place

1095
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,880
for being able to enable that.

1096
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,960
So one thing we could potentially be looking at

1097
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,720
is having all the things.

1098
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,920
What's the official story on the, I guess,

1099
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,040
what seems to me to be the fundamental issue with Snaps

1100
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,240
on Fedora in that they are built around confinement provided

1101
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,440
by App Armor.

1102
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,600
And Fedora uses SELinux, not App Armor.

1103
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,400
So is there some sort of shim that

1104
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,120
can be created where App Armor gets translated SELinux?

1105
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,560
Is something like that even possible?

1106
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,800
Or is Fedora going to be a Snap confinement-free zone?

1107
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,160
I hope not.

1108
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,080
That defeats the point.

1109
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,880
So what most people don't understand

1110
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,080
is that Snap is not App Armor native either.

1111
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,080
What it does is it has an abstract set of permissions.

1112
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,400
Similar to how Android and other mobile OSes work,

1113
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,960
it kind of works that way.

1114
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,440
And internally, it translates into a mixture

1115
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,400
of set comp and App Armor rules.

1116
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,960
Now, the App Armor stuff only fully works on Ubuntu

1117
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,280
because they have their own changes that are not upstreamed.

1118
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,440
And it's been that way forevermore.

1119
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,440
But it'll maybe someday change.

1120
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,160
But the set comp stuff works.

1121
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:05,720
And there is upcoming in the next feature release,

1122
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,320
2.39, the very most basic support for SELinux.

1123
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,720
It doesn't do much.

1124
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,280
It just mainly enhances the confinement of the SnapD part.

1125
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,840
And the Snap confined tools are appropriately guarded.

1126
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,920
And so it doesn't throw all kinds of crazy errors

1127
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,160
all over the place.

1128
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,720
But it's a starting place.

1129
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,920
And the idea is that we can build from this.

1130
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,600
And if people are interested in making

1131
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,120
this work better in Fedora, they can

1132
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:37,040
help with developing this SELinux backend for the SnapD

1133
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,080
security system, the Snap confined system.

1134
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,600
So there is now the potential in Git Master

1135
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,200
for a proper SELinux backend.

1136
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,440
It links to libSELinux.

1137
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,480
It just doesn't do much with it yet.

1138
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,720
And there may be some development that needs to happen

1139
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,640
upstream in the SELinux side.

1140
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,120
Unfortunately, while I know how to write SELinux policies

1141
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,000
and I'm pretty good at it, I can do the security stuff

1142
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,800
as good as any other sysadmin who

1143
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,400
has to do this kind of thing.

1144
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,480
I'm not that good at being able to write

1145
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,280
into complex integration logic, translating mechanisms

1146
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,320
backwards and forwards, and dealing

1147
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,560
with all of those moving parts.

1148
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,160
That's not my forte, unfortunately.

1149
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,200
No, come on.

1150
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,080
All right, well, let me get your hot take on Fedora 30.

1151
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,800
Just sort of high level.

1152
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,400
What are you pumped about?

1153
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,400
And what should we know about that we haven't touched on?

1154
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,840
So there's a couple of things that I'm really pumped about.

1155
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,360
One of them is it's a really low level piece.

1156
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,720
But then again, if you know me, you

1157
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,080
know that I love the low level pieces.

1158
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,520
We changed the way that grub is configured in Fedora 30

1159
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,400
by default. So if you're installing Fedora 30,

1160
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,280
your grub configuration will be changed

1161
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,120
to using what's called the bootloader spec, which

1162
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,880
is something that's been floating around for a few years.

1163
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,360
The biggest thing that makes this interesting

1164
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,920
is that now all of the loader entries in grub,

1165
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,440
or any of the other bootloaders that we would configure,

1166
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,760
but mainly grub, are now drop-in files.

1167
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,160
And they're compatible with both grub and SD boot.

1168
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,640
So if you were on an EFI system, you

1169
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,040
could choose between grub or system dboot.

1170
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,600
And the configurations would work exactly the same.

1171
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,480
But for the most part, it is grub that you're usually using.

1172
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,520
It's the one we officially support right now.

1173
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,400
But the option is now there.

1174
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,000
And there's other boot managers out there in the EFI space

1175
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,560
that would be able to support using those drop-in files.

1176
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,720
So the big thing is that now that we have that,

1177
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,280
we can make it so that we don't have to clobber each other all

1178
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,560
the time as other distributions begin

1179
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,720
to adopt the bootloader spec.

1180
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,720
I've heard from a couple of contributors

1181
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,600
on the OpenSUSE side that are interested in bringing

1182
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,440
our patches to grub and other pieces

1183
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,600
to make it so that the bootloader spec is supported

1184
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,480
in OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and adapting YAST

1185
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,760
so that it generates bootloader spec entries rather

1186
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,520
than manipulating grub.

1187
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,600
By doing that, then Fedora and OpenSUSE

1188
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,240
can sit side by side without clobbering each other.

1189
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,080
And because I already integrated the patches for dealing

1190
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,560
with SUSE's boot to snapshot into the Fedora grub,

1191
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,560
some time ago, any design that we work on for supporting this

1192
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,480
should be able to work on both Fedora and OpenSUSE properly.

1193
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,800
But you're still using FreeBSD on your main desktop, right?

1194
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,800
Hell no.

1195
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,160
What do you take me for?

1196
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,360
How great would it have been if you'd said yes, though?

1197
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,800
That would have been so funny.

1198
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,120
I can't even do that as a joke, and you know it.

1199
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,080
But yeah, bootloader spec is one of the big things

1200
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,320
that I'm excited about.

1201
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,920
And the other thing I'm excited about

1202
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,640
is that we're murdering Python 2 in its sleep piece by piece.

1203
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,680
Yeah, go on on that, because I touched on that briefly.

1204
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,160
So I'm one of the people that have

1205
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,320
been working on murdering Python 2 in its sleep.

1206
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,160
If you look at the change entry, my name is mentioned.

1207
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,680
That's awful, but very good.

1208
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,400
So what we've done for Fedora 30 is that we've gone through

1209
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,960
and we've looked at the chains of things

1210
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,520
that were available in Python 2 and Python 3,

1211
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,840
and nothing was using the Python 2 part.

1212
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,520
And we went and deleted them.

1213
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,800
And I think we've cut a little over maybe 1,500 or so Python

1214
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,000
2 modules and packages.

1215
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,960
Also, we ported a number of Fedora infrastructure software

1216
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,440
from Python 2 to Python 3.

1217
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,200
So for example, the Koji build system is now Python 3,

1218
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,640
except for a small piece of it that

1219
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,600
still needs to be Python 2 for now.

1220
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:33,920
That will be fixed, hopefully, soon.

1221
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,920
Our update system, a lot of our compose process tools,

1222
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,880
our imaging tools across the board,

1223
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,360
like we've done a very drastic switch from Python 2

1224
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,560
to Python 3.

1225
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,320
I think the only thing that we currently

1226
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,080
have in production at this point that's still running on Python

1227
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:57,280
2 is the Fedora account system and the Pagar servers, which

1228
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,520
are running on CentOS 7.

1229
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,400
Or, well, FAS is running on CentOS 6, or RHEL 6, sorry.

1230
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,840
We're actually running on RHEL.

1231
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,320
They're running on RHEL 6, and the Pagar servers

1232
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,680
are running on RHEL 7.

1233
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,120
And so those are the only pieces,

1234
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,480
I think, that are still running on Python 2,

1235
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,840
because Python 3 hasn't been introduced into RHEL 7 base,

1236
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,160
which is coming in the next point.

1237
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,720
It's coming in the next point release.

1238
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,400
There's a Red Hat bug for it, which

1239
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,160
I can provide you a link later to show that it is coming.

1240
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,000
So that will help accelerate the death of Python 2,

1241
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,760
because it's been used as an excuse for a long time

1242
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,560
to not port things, because Red Hat isn't supporting Python 3

1243
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,120
in the RHEL 7.

1244
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,200
No, no, no, it is.

1245
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,600
Port your crap.

1246
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,240
And that's a new shirt right there, port your crap.

1247
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,360
All right, well, Neil, thank you very much.

1248
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,400
Now, continuing along this theme, live here on the show,

1249
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,280
prepare yourself.

1250
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,560
You ready for this, Mr. Wes Payne?

1251
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,800
Can you upgrade one of our most critical servers

1252
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,480
in the Jupyter broadcasting infrastructure to Fedora 30

1253
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,080
live on the podcast?

1254
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,080
I think it's going to be a question of timing, I'm afraid.

1255
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,760
Well, we're doing our updates right now,

1256
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,880
just to get to a nice up-to-date set up, right?

1257
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,760
Oh, OK, yeah, OK, so we were a little behind on the updates.

1258
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,640
Not too far, but we had some to do, yeah.

1259
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,720
I mean, we've been busy, right, LinuxFest Northwest?

1260
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,520
Yeah, blame it on that.

1261
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,880
Not the months beforehand where we didn't do any updates.

1262
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,280
And then there's a DNF plug-in for doing the system upgrade.

1263
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,480
So once we're there, I mean, can I do it?

1264
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,360
I can certainly run the command.

1265
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,760
OK, when do you think?

1266
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,320
Do you think you'll get it before the end of the show?

1267
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,880
We're chugging along right now, so there's only one way

1268
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,400
to find out.

1269
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,480
All right, we'll come back to that.

1270
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,160
We'll come back to that.

1271
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,480
Stand by, we'll see.

1272
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:45,960
We'll see.

1273
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,080
Before we go, Alex, did you have anything

1274
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,520
to add to our Fedora blowout here?

1275
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,120
I know you're potentially, possibly,

1276
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,720
rumor has it, a Fedora user.

1277
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,320
Yeah, rumor has it.

1278
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,240
So there's been a really interesting development

1279
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,720
with something called Fedora Silverblue, actually.

1280
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,920
And it's the love child of CoreOS and Fedora.

1281
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,320
So it's an immutable desktop OS.

1282
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,000
And we've had several immutable server distros,

1283
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,600
such as Project Atomic and Rancher, for a while now.

1284
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,600
And Silverblue is aimed at those of you

1285
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,520
with container-based workflows.

1286
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:27,320
And it targets the development communities above all others.

1287
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,520
There's a few things I like about RPMOS Tree.

1288
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,840
You can have Atomic upgrades, which is really nice.

1289
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,480
Let's say an upgrade balks your system.

1290
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,880
It's really easy to roll back with Atomic.

1291
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,280
So the way that works is you boot from partition A

1292
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,800
into your operating system.

1293
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,840
You then use RPMOS Tree to install a new image

1294
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,120
onto partition B. Reboot into partition B,

1295
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,400
leaving A untouched so that if ever there's an issue,

1296
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,760
you just fall back to partition A.

1297
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,560
And there's no practical limit on the number of images

1298
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,160
that you can have available for this purpose.

1299
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:12,400
So you could reboot to partition Q if you wanted to.

1300
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,400
So it allows you to switch between different versions.

1301
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,480
I'm doing air quotes.

1302
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,880
You can't see it.

1303
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,040
Different versions of Fedora, different spins, if you like.

1304
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,960
So you could switch between a version of Fedora

1305
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:31,240
but maybe had LXDE included, LXQT, sorry,

1306
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,360
included versus XFCE just by rebooting

1307
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,800
into a different partition or a different image,

1308
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,920
which makes it really nice.

1309
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,800
Yeah.

1310
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,480
You can layer legacy applications,

1311
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,120
package just RPMs over the top.

1312
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,680
So that might include things like fonts and printer drivers,

1313
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,840
et cetera.

1314
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,560
So there is still support for the old school type things.

1315
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,160
But the primary method for delivering software

1316
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,480
on Silverblue is flat packs.

1317
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,840
So we're all familiar with snaps and flat packs and stuff

1318
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,160
on this show, I hope, by now.

1319
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,160
Even command line applications?

1320
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,200
Yes, I believe so.

1321
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,520
Things like Vim delivered as a flat pack.

1322
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,920
Oh.

1323
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:08,840
Yeah.

1324
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,240
So it's really, like I said before,

1325
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,160
the love child of CoreOS and Fedora.

1326
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,840
And there's some really, really cool stuff in there, yeah.

1327
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,760
Yeah, that is a kind of beautiful thing to see.

1328
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,560
And it's something that we've been watching pretty carefully.

1329
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,640
And I don't know, it's nice to meet.

1330
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,400
Can you be our, what do you think, Alex?

1331
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,320
Will you be our Silverblue correspondent?

1332
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,800
Yes.

1333
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,960
Yeah, I like that.

1334
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,440
You sound really dedicated.

1335
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,080
Oh, I just got the thumbs up from Mr. Westpain.

1336
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,560
All right, here we go, ladies and gentlemen.

1337
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,520
We're at the prompt.

1338
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,520
Do you want to continue?

1339
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,480
Yes.

1340
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,280
Yes, we do.

1341
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,520
I hit Y.

1342
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,840
All right, and Enter.

1343
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,760
Now, away we go.

1344
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,720
And what do we got here?

1345
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,560
We're downloading some packages.

1346
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,440
Yeah, we're doing some updates first.

1347
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,600
Yep, see, we've set up, right?

1348
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,960
We're moving to the Fedora 30 repos instead of 29.

1349
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,200
So you've installed the DNF upgrade plugin.

1350
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,800
Yep, and then we run system upgrade.

1351
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,360
Why don't we break this down a little bit?

1352
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,320
So the way this works on Fedora

1353
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,160
is not necessarily the way it works on Debian,

1354
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,760
where you can do a dist upgrade and you can start off.

1355
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,600
This actually, you kind of have to tell DNF,

1356
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,280
hey buddy, it's time to switch over to 30.

1357
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,240
Yeah, exactly.

1358
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,800
So now we've started downloading all the new stuff.

1359
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,480
So right now we're just in the download state

1360
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,680
getting all the packages we'll want

1361
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,480
as we upgrade to the new release.

1362
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,160
And once that's finished, we'll run system upgrade reboot,

1363
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,720
and then it'll reboot and actually upgrade us

1364
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:33,760
and get us to a Fedora 30.

1365
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,320
And is it using system D in some way to do this?

1366
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,240
My understanding is that it is for the upgrade process,

1367
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,040
that it reboots and system D takes it into a state

1368
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,120
where then it installs all of the packages

1369
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,440
and then reboots again.

1370
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,640
Some fancy stuff they do.

1371
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,480
It really is.

1372
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,440
You know, kind of like Windows a little bit

1373
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,640
where you got to do the package upgrades offline,

1374
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,700
but I guess it's safer not to have that stuff

1375
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,540
loaded in memory.

1376
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,360
And I mean, one of the nice things about Fedora

1377
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,360
is you upgrade a lot.

1378
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,040
So you need it to be reliable,

1379
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,540
but it can be reliable because it is actually happening.

1380
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,960
It's not, you know, how many Ubuntu users do you know

1381
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,480
that skip a few LTSs and they're going from a 12 to an 18,

1382
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,560
and it's really painful.

1383
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,880
Well, you can't really do that on Fedora.

1384
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,680
You don't have five years either, right?

1385
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,260
So you've got to keep it up to date.

1386
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,240
And that's one of the deals you make

1387
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,800
when you deploy a Fedora system.

1388
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,860
And our system here, the Orbital system that we have,

1389
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,780
that is one of our most valuable machines

1390
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:32,040
that runs many containers that supply production services,

1391
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,540
that supply encoding services,

1392
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:36,520
that run the Casta Blast automated encoding system.

1393
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,200
All of that is a series of different containers

1394
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,100
on our Orbital server running on Fedora 29,

1395
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,680
that we are now upgrading to Fedora 30.

1396
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,160
If this breaks, we literally will not be able

1397
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,200
to publish this show.

1398
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,000
I mean, I think Joe is just going to yell at us.

1399
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,400
That's going to be the primary outcome.

1400
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,040
Please tell me when it's that you took a snapshot

1401
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,520
of this before you started.

1402
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,340
Yeah, it's-

1403
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,180
You did?

1404
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,760
Cause we meant to, but I forgot.

1405
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,000
I forgot to do that.

1406
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,940
Cause if this goes wrong, our FM stream is off the air.

1407
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,800
Our publishing system is off the air.

1408
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,980
I mean, we're going to have to reboot the FM stream anyway.

1409
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,820
So that's-

1410
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:08,640
Are we?

1411
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,480
Of course.

1412
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,320
Yeah, we're going to reboot the system.

1413
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,560
Did you check the disk space though?

1414
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,880
That's the question.

1415
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,120
Yeah, we're doing fine there.

1416
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,080
Okay, all right.

1417
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,560
All right, how far are we along now, Wes?

1418
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,160
All right, download complete.

1419
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,680
Phew.

1420
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,720
You know, as we've done this,

1421
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,840
it's really hit me how critical this system is.

1422
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,440
And if this breaks, we can't use Fedora anymore.

1423
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,840
Like if this breaks-

1424
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,660
Well, I don't know if that's true.

1425
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,800
No, seriously.

1426
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,640
Dude, really?

1427
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,600
That's pretty extreme.

1428
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,840
Have it break every nine months on us or whatever it is?

1429
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,680
Really?

1430
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,500
That's not-

1431
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,520
Well, that's no guarantee it's going to break every time.

1432
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,800
If it breaks, I mean, but a five year distribution-

1433
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,320
Generally, one takes slightly more precautions

1434
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,400
before upgrading-

1435
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,240
True.

1436
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,160
But a five year distribution by its very nature

1437
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,600
needs to be upgraded like this less often

1438
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,080
than a Fedora distribution.

1439
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,760
And if it breaks once, then that's it for me.

1440
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,760
It could break again.

1441
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,200
Yeah, it has to be 100% reliable.

1442
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,400
That's a myth.

1443
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,480
There's no 100% reliability.

1444
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,840
It's one thing for an LTS,

1445
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,360
like an Ubuntu LTS upgrade to break

1446
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,720
because you go five years in between upgrades.

1447
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,480
Really, it's always a cost benefit question, right?

1448
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,080
There is obviously a cost to having to upgrade more often.

1449
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,320
There are upsides too, because, you know,

1450
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,520
we just measure, is it worth what we get with Fedora?

1451
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,720
You lied to you having cockpit set up and ready to roll.

1452
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,120
It was an easy system to manage.

1453
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,320
You enjoyed DNF.

1454
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,200
I've never had a DNF upgrade fail me yet.

1455
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,200
It's just that nothing like this

1456
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,200
has ever been on the line before.

1457
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,560
I've never had this many important things

1458
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,680
on the line before.

1459
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,760
Sounds to me like you need to have something ready to go

1460
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,800
to replace this system.

1461
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,560
Any snowflake that is in that kind of position

1462
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:41,600
that you depend on that much makes me really nervous.

1463
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,240
Honestly, we could.

1464
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,120
Because it's all containerized.

1465
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,480
I mean, we just start all the services somewhere else.

1466
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,320
It's fine.

1467
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,160
It'll be good.

1468
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,600
What version of Fedora did this start out on, by the way?

1469
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,000
This one, we might've been a fresh install of 29

1470
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,200
because we reconsolidated down onto a Fedora box.

1471
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,040
So this one was probably-

1472
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,880
There's no ancient behemoth.

1473
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,280
Right, but we had been for a long time upgrading

1474
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,720
for many, many years.

1475
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,120
We just recently decided to start fresh with a new base.

1476
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,360
All right, we're ready.

1477
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,720
I'm sitting here.

1478
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,960
Okay, this is the reboot?

1479
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,800
Yeah.

1480
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,840
All right, let's do it, Wes.

1481
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,680
Hit it.

1482
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,960
All right, as I say, it's connection dropped.

1483
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,960
Now we just wait.

1484
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,400
Now we just wait for it to reboot.

1485
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,520
Come on, Fedora.

1486
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,120
This is about as on the line as it gets.

1487
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:28,320
And really, it's important that this works

1488
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,520
because with the update frequency of Fedora,

1489
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,440
this has to work.

1490
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,200
Come on.

1491
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,400
Not up yet.

1492
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,640
It's gotta do all the updates.

1493
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,000
It's gotta bring up the console through DigitalOcean.

1494
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,840
That's what I'm working on right now.

1495
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,680
Okay, good.

1496
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,920
All right.

1497
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,160
Oh my gosh, Drew, are you totally worried

1498
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,240
it's not gonna work right now?

1499
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,720
I haven't ever had an experience

1500
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,720
where DNF upgrade went horribly wrong.

1501
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,560
Oh no.

1502
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,560
You know it's gonna go wrong now.

1503
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,160
You feel like we got a good shot here?

1504
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,360
Yeah, yeah.

1505
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,840
Yeah, you don't sound super confident, man.

1506
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:06,160
It has to be better than upgrading from Ubuntu 14.04

1507
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,280
to 16.04 where it just rips out PHP without telling you.

1508
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,000
Not that you would know, right, Joe?

1509
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,320
No, I wouldn't know anything about that.

1510
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:16,080
No, not that I did that with a live production system

1511
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,880
and then quickly roll back to a backup or anything.

1512
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,000
Well, I'm glad you had a backup.

1513
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,520
Good job on you.

1514
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,280
That's just admin 101 right there.

1515
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,560
Wes, you have a very, very, very serious face right now.

1516
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,440
Well, that's just my resting serious face.

1517
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,720
Okay, I won't body shame.

1518
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,560
I'm sorry.

1519
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,800
I'm just very like, I'm reading Wes's face

1520
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,200
to try to like interpret like.

1521
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,600
Oh, it just rebooted.

1522
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,440
Okay, all right.

1523
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,280
So we're just.

1524
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,400
I'm watching, I got the console up, yeah.

1525
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,880
Okay, good, good.

1526
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,560
What are you seeing?

1527
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,000
Well, just standard, you know, kernel output.

1528
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,520
You are. Or detecting devices.

1529
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,960
You are as calm as it gets right now.

1530
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,160
You are not worried about this at all.

1531
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,240
Yeah, it's fine.

1532
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,560
I, on the other hand, am having a mild panic attack.

1533
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,760
So that's good.

1534
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,760
I mean, we got droplets, you know, whatever.

1535
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,680
I can spit things out.

1536
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,520
This is what I sound like when I'm having.

1537
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,800
Sorry, we should have apologized

1538
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,400
for one of the FM stream listeners, really.

1539
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,320
Oh yeah, we just cut them all off.

1540
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,160
This is what I sound like

1541
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,680
when I'm having a panic attack, by the way.

1542
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,520
I still sound like my regular self.

1543
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,220
I'm just exploding with emotions on the inside.

1544
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,720
Well, I'm trying to load the upload page

1545
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,400
that I used to publish the shows and nothing yet.

1546
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,880
Yeah, that means the containers haven't started yet.

1547
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,600
That's for the cast a blast system.

1548
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,240
Oh God, Wes, oh God.

1549
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,080
Oh my God.

1550
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,360
I mean, we've had a clean disc mount.

1551
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,700
That's always good.

1552
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,540
I gotta come over and look.

1553
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:35,000
I gotta come over here and look, stand by.

1554
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,720
Okay, all right.

1555
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,200
That's just a bunch of system D,

1556
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,160
that's just a bunch of system D air messages

1557
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,080
on the screen right now.

1558
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,800
I mean, they're audit log.

1559
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,640
Oh my God.

1560
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,740
I just broke one of our most important servers

1561
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,080
for a stupid bit on the show.

1562
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,360
It's probably system D SE Linux auto relabeling everything.

1563
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,840
So just calm yourself, calm your boots.

1564
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,520
Okay, all right, I'll go with that.

1565
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,760
I like that Drew has legitimately gotten up

1566
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,720
out of his seat away from the microphone

1567
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,760
so that way he can watch.

1568
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,000
Yeah, he's pacing watching Wes's screen right now.

1569
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,160
Oh my gosh, Wes, I am literally about to explode.

1570
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,160
Please tell me something here.

1571
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,760
Oh God.

1572
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,920
I mean, it's detecting stuff.

1573
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,040
We've figured out we're running under KVM.

1574
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,860
Oh God, okay.

1575
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:21,720
So yeah, I mean, it looks like a normal

1576
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,520
post upgrade boot process.

1577
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,200
It just has a lot to do.

1578
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,040
Yeah, surely there's plenty of things going on.

1579
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,700
That doesn't look normal.

1580
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:31,380
I've done a lot of Fedora updates.

1581
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,580
All those system D messages don't look normal.

1582
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,620
Well, there's a lot more system D these days.

1583
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:39,020
I mean, it has taken, eaten over the entire Linux system.

1584
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,420
It's usually just a bunch of packages getting upgraded

1585
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,700
and then your kernel gets updated,

1586
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:44,860
your grub entries get updated and it reboots.

1587
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,100
That's usually what it is.

1588
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,540
It's not coming up.

1589
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,620
I think we've killed the system

1590
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:51,500
and we need to acknowledge that we have just killed

1591
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,020
our production server trying to upgrade to Fedora 30.

1592
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,680
So about that snapshot, Wes.

1593
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:00,680
We just had Fedora 30 kill our box.

1594
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,740
I mean, we got to wait a while.

1595
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,860
We've been here like two minutes, three minutes.

1596
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,040
It's been a long time, dude.

1597
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,380
And this is a digital ocean droplet

1598
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,660
with a massive connection and a fast SSD.

1599
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,900
I think we've killed the box.

1600
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,740
Oh my God.

1601
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,180
It is taking a little while.

1602
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:17,980
I'll give you that.

1603
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,780
This music is making it way more tense too though.

1604
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,180
Wes, I think this is it.

1605
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,140
I think we got to call it.

1606
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,420
I think we've killed Orbital.

1607
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,480
Yeah, and you'll just have to tune in

1608
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,500
and see what the fallout was next episode.

1609
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,260
Are they able to publish?

1610
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,500
Wait and see.

1611
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,740
Are you able to tune in?

1612
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,760
At least we're recording this one early

1613
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,460
so we can have it fixed by Tuesday.

1614
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,580
Oh my gosh.

1615
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,660
Wow.

1616
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,740
Well, I guess we're going to have a meeting discussing

1617
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:56,480
if we should continue to use Fedora in production.

1618
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,320
Wow.

1619
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,140
All right.

1620
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,300
Well, there's that.

1621
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,200
I guess we continue on.

1622
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,140
I can't believe we just killed our server.

1623
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,660
Should have used Silverblue.

1624
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:07,500
Yeah.

1625
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:08,320
Yeah, that's right.

1626
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,160
You know what?

1627
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,340
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

1628
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:15,140
Well, on that note, we do have some pics.

1629
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,920
We'll get to those in the post-show.

1630
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,180
We'll do the pics in the post-show.

1631
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,380
Post-show pics.

1632
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,020
On that note, I think that's our Fedora 30 review

1633
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:24,920
right there.

1634
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,400
Best review ever.

1635
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,440
And stick around in the post-show,

1636
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,020
coming up in just a few minutes.

1637
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,380
We've got some really good pics because it is episode 300.

1638
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,460
And while we are breaking servers,

1639
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,320
we have got some birthday pics for you

1640
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,640
coming up in the post-show.

1641
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:41,340
But join us, not next week,

1642
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,820
but the week after for a live show.

1643
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,720
We'll be back from Red Hat Summit at jblive.tv.

1644
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,500
Go to linuxunplug.com for links,

1645
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,420
subscribe links, contact information, and more.

1646
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:53,420
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1647
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:24,260
Well, that didn't go as we planned, did it?

1648
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,260
Not quite.

1649
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:27,260
All right, well, Wes has got a job to do.

1650
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,260
It's doing more now.

1651
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:29,260
Is it?

1652
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,260
It's continuing on.

1653
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,260
Yeah, there's a lot.

1654
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,260
There's a lot.

1655
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,260
Perhaps it'll continue on.

1656
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,260
You just need to calm yourself, Chris.

1657
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,260
It'll calm.

1658
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,260
I have faith.

1659
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:37,260
Okay, all right.

1660
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,260
Well, in the meantime, how about a couple of extra bonus pics?

1661
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,260
Some really good ones this week.

1662
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:42,260
Bonus.

1663
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,260
Post-show bonus pics.

1664
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:44,260
I'm going to say it's called Buku.

1665
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,260
What do you think?

1666
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,260
Yeah, Buku.

1667
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,260
Buku.

1668
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,260
Buku.

1669
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:49,260
Buku.

1670
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,260
Buku.

1671
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:51,260
Buku.

1672
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,260
Buku.

1673
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:53,260
Buku.

1674
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,260
Buku.

1675
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,260
Buku.

1676
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,260
Buku.

1677
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,260
Buku.

1678
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:00,160
Buku, B-U-K-U is a freaking powerful command line bookmark manager.

1679
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,580
It uses Python 3 and SQLite.

1680
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:03,780
I like both those things.

1681
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,780
I know, and it looks really good.

1682
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:13,220
It also has Buku server, which exposes a browsable frontend for a local web server.

1683
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:18,420
It can auto-import bookmarks, BukuMarks, as it were, from your browser.

1684
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,380
or you can go out and fetch the title and the description

1685
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,900
from a bookmarked URL from the web.

1686
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:26,040
You can get started right away and it looks badass.

1687
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,340
It is what I would say

1688
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:29,500
a well-designed command line application.

1689
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,340
Oh, hey, I'm in.

1690
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:31,160
It's up.

1691
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,000
No way.

1692
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,600
I don't think I don't think everything started yet.

1693
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,060
So like the upload page.

1694
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,340
Yeah.

1695
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,500
No upload page yet.

1696
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,420
No upload page yet.

1697
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,260
Okay. All right.

1698
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,380
So the host operating systems up at the containers.

1699
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:46,260
But we've got Fedora 30 cloud edition installed.

1700
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,100
All right.

1701
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,300
Let's see if in the next, before I'm done with the picks,

1702
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,260
let's see if Wes can get the containers running.

1703
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:54,080
Our next pick, Drew and I really liked this one.

1704
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:54,920
Wes found it.

1705
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,100
Sysctl Explorer.

1706
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:00,420
So Sysctl are different means of configuring certain aspects

1707
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,580
of the kernel at runtime.

1708
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:05,620
You know, you can adjust things like in the proxies directory

1709
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:09,860
and a lot of times you just don't even know what's available.

1710
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:12,500
So that's where Sysctl Explorer comes in.

1711
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,980
It is a great tool to look up the different things

1712
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:18,100
that you can adjust in real time.

1713
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,920
It's a web page to facilitate access

1714
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,860
to the different documentation.

1715
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,220
It's a work in progress

1716
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:27,120
and it's sort of an MVP state right now,

1717
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:32,120
but you can find it at sysctl-explorer.net.

1718
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:35,160
Or of course we'll have a link in the show nizzles,

1719
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,400
which are probably in your podcast player of choice.

1720
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,660
I would imagine.

1721
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:40,340
All right, Wes, one more pick to go.

1722
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:41,180
How are you feeling?

1723
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:42,000
Yeah, I think we're up.

1724
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:42,840
No way.

1725
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,860
Joe, Joe, can you get the page up?

1726
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:48,300
I can confirm I can see the upload page.

1727
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:51,020
Yeah, good job, Wes.

1728
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,160
Damn, brah.

1729
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,460
You got it, man, you got it.

1730
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,020
So we have a successful Fedora 30 upgrade.

1731
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:58,900
That's good.

1732
01:03:58,900 --> 01:03:59,940
That was a lot of fun to build the tension.

1733
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:03,680
Okay, and FM stream should be coming online too.

1734
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,180
Welcome back, radio audience.

1735
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,020
Let's see if that happens.

1736
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:08,620
Now coming to you from a Fedora 30 installation.

1737
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:11,340
Nicely done, nicely done.

1738
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:16,180
And our last pick is another command line application

1739
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,500
that takes a graphical classic

1740
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,440
and brings it to the terminal.

1741
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:24,580
Termshark, a terminal user interface

1742
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:27,180
for Tshark inspired by Wireshark.

1743
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,580
So this is a beautiful, and I mean it,

1744
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:34,140
beautiful terminal application to do a brilliant job

1745
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,260
of monitoring your traffic.

1746
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,860
Yes, of course there's TCP dump friends,

1747
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:40,980
but who wants that when you can have a nice end curses

1748
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:45,420
full Wireshark-like interface in your damn terminal.

1749
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,320
That's Termshark.

1750
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,420
It seems pretty handy.

1751
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:50,420
I've only tried it like a little tiny bit, but.

1752
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,580
Gosh, it's nice, dude.

1753
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,300
Sometimes loading up the whole Wireshark thing

1754
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,260
is like a lot.

1755
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,660
Drew, did you see this?

1756
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:58,660
Yeah, just looking at the GitHub page, I love this.

1757
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,220
Because there have been so many times

1758
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:02,140
where I've deployed like a Raspberry Pi

1759
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:05,020
or something on a site and run a capture,

1760
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,520
and then I've gotta go retrieve that capture,

1761
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,020
download it locally, open it in Wireshark.

1762
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,140
And parse it, and view it, and filter it.

1763
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:15,140
But if I could go in and look directly on a terminal,

1764
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:18,900
just SSH in, how cool is that?

1765
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,260
Super cool, it's so great.

1766
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,580
Termshark, and we'll have a link for that

1767
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,420
in the show notes as well.

1768
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,220
So Wes, are you giving it the old Wes Payne

1769
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,700
once over right now?

1770
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,220
Indeed, inspecting things.

1771
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,820
And how's it looking so far?

1772
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,460
How's it looking over there?

1773
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:33,300
Are we?

1774
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:40,060
So far, I think everything's up and running.

1775
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:44,980
I gotta say, I am very, very impressed.

1776
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:45,940
That deserves an eagle.

1777
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:51,060
Fedora30, you once again have impressed?

1778
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:53,340
Except those people that didn't hang around to the post show

1779
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,020
don't know that.

1780
01:05:54,020 --> 01:06:05,380
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
