1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
I'm on the podcast at social,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,440
so I actually do have a Mastodon account.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,600
It's funny, because I was asking people

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,120
if they had a Mastodon account,

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,440
and they were like, are you gonna set one up?

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,120
And I was like, no, I don't think so.

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,200
I don't think I'm gonna,

8
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,400
I don't really wanna do any social media.

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,080
I'm pretty burned out on social media.

10
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,120
And then I realized I actually already

11
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,320
had a Mastodon account set up,

12
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,640
and that I was using it actively.

13
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,960
But I just didn't think of it as Mastodon,

14
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,160
because I'm just using it to interact

15
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,520
with the Podcasting 2.0 folks in the community over there.

16
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,640
And so I didn't even really consider it Mastodon.

17
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,400
But it totes my goats is, so I am,

18
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,440
see, if you wanna come follow,

19
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm really not tweeting much for public consumption.

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,120
It's mostly for people that are interested in podcasting,

21
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,200
but I'll put a link to my profile.

22
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,880
It's podcastindex.social, and guess what?

23
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,200
I'm Chris Lass on there.

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,680
Oh, hey, I like podcasting.

25
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,640
Yeah, you might wanna, have I sent you an invite?

26
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,980
I don't think so. I wonder if I could.

27
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,080
I'll have to figure that out.

28
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,760
But I got a little picture of Levi on my profile.

29
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,040
I think Brent took that picture, too, I think.

30
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,400
Do you remember when it was taken?

31
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,520
Probably the sprint,

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,360
because it's Levi laying on the couch, I think.

33
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,600
I mean, when does Levi not lay on the couch?

34
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,440
That's the thing,

35
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,120
that doesn't really narrow it down, I realize.

36
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,120
Hello, friends, and welcome back

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,060
to your weekly Linux talk show.

38
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,900
My name is Chris.

39
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,720
My name is Wes.

40
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,760
And my name is Brent.

41
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,080
Hello, gentlemen, both looking very sharp today, and I-

42
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
We had to trade outfits at the last minute, can you tell?

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,360
I can, but I like that you guys make the effort.

44
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,400
You know, it's a show day, it's special.

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,840
Well, coming up today, if we had a Linux time machine,

46
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,440
what would we change in our Linux past

47
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,400
if we could go back and make one tweak or correction?

48
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,720
Do we have any regrets, something we would do differently,

49
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,840
maybe put us on a better Linux path?

50
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,160
Each one of us will share a bit

51
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,520
of a retrospective lesson today.

52
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,400
Then, of course, we'll round it up with some great boosts

53
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,280
and emails and a lot more, like we always do.

54
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,840
So before we go any further,

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,760
let's say a big, hearty welcome to the people

56
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,220
who decided to make it live, to make it special,

57
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,120
time-appropriate greetings, virtual log.

58
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,080
Hello, Mumble Room.

59
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,920
Hello.

60
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,740
Hello, hello, hello.

61
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,580
Hello, Chris.

62
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,080
Hello, Wes, and hello, Brent.

63
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,200
Aw.

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Who invited Zoidberg?

65
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,080
Nice of Zoidberg to make it, yeah.

66
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
I apologize, you have a sleepy crew here today.

67
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,000
Like, none of us got any sleep last night.

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,120
So I don't know how today's show

69
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,000
was even gonna go.

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,080
Whatever happens, don't hold us accountable, please.

71
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,880
I wasn't even supposed to be here.

72
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,880
I was gonna be in a small, little beach town in Oregon.

73
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,920
I'm nothing fancy, but a little beach town

74
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,840
celebrating my son's 13th birthday,

75
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,880
which if you've been listening since I started having kids,

76
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,480
how crazy is that?

77
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,700
Because people have been.

78
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,540
I know.

79
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,740
People have been listening since before I had kids.

80
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,900
That's crazy.

81
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,120
And as we were getting ready to head out,

82
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,760
and you know, of course,

83
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,000
I've arranged the entire last week

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,120
of all of our recordings

85
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,920
to make sure I could take Friday and Saturday off.

86
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,360
Yeah, you've been planning this for a while,

87
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,620
getting jupe-ship shape.

88
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,600
You know, like a lot of pre-planning to make this happen.

89
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,800
Yep, trying to get parts in,

90
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
trying to get her into the shop,

91
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,160
all that kind of stuff.

92
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,320
And of course, Friday morning,

93
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,400
as we were supposed to set out,

94
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,720
we realized Dylan's sick.

95
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,320
And it's the kind of sick, like,

96
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,840
maybe this gets better,

97
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,520
maybe this gets a lot worse.

98
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,460
And the last time we went to this town,

99
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,920
it turned out it was like early January 2020.

100
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,640
It turned out we think D and I had COVID,

101
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,120
but we didn't know it at the time.

102
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,640
And so we were horrendously sick,

103
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,240
and we had locked ourselves into the RV,

104
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,280
and that's how we spent our time in this town.

105
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
And we just didn't want the-

106
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,440
You didn't want to do that again.

107
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,720
No, and we didn't want to have Dylan sick on the road.

108
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,060
Fair, yeah.

109
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,980
But canceling this road trip,

110
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,300
he was just totally crushed, right?

111
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,280
And I was super bummed and all of that.

112
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,360
So we decided to kind of do something a little simpler

113
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,000
and just head out to our favorite spot in the woods,

114
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,300
which is only like two hours out, right?

115
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,640
So if anything goes wrong, we're not far away.

116
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,840
You're still near home base.

117
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,680
Yeah.

118
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,040
So we decided, okay, let's do that.

119
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,160
And plus we got a later start in the day and all that.

120
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,440
So this is a better route to go.

121
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,880
And I call up the place we're going to stay and I cancel.

122
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,900
And we start heading out.

123
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,200
And my wife, Hadia, she's chasing the RV in her car.

124
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,440
So she's behind me, right?

125
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,280
She's following us.

126
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,580
And as we hit highway 20, heading east,

127
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,600
heading towards the mountains,

128
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,720
we're doing about 60 miles per hour.

129
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,560
And my wife pings me on the two-way radio.

130
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,720
And she says,

131
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,160
we have some kind of major water leak going on right now.

132
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,560
And I'm like, what, what, what?

133
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,440
She's like, there's water pouring out of the RV.

134
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,960
It's covering my windshield.

135
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,160
I'm running my windshield wipers.

136
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,520
There's so much water coming out right now.

137
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,360
That's insane.

138
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,700
And I'm like, oh my God, right?

139
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,920
I just think, oh no,

140
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,120
if we have another major water leak happen,

141
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,800
this place is wrecked.

142
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,620
We've already had a major spill once.

143
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,460
That's pretty much it.

144
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,300
Yeah, right?

145
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,320
How much more can you withstand?

146
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,280
Game over, man.

147
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,360
Game over, right?

148
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,080
So I go into total disaster mode.

149
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,480
At 60 miles an hour.

150
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,840
Right, and I'm like, Dylan,

151
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,000
help me find a spot to pull over

152
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,120
because he's riding passenger, right?

153
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,960
And he's like, I think that's up there.

154
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,800
I'm like, yeah, okay, we're gonna do it.

155
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,400
And I pull over like super quick.

156
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,560
I don't even know how the RV stopped like that.

157
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,080
And unfortunately, like it was so quick

158
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,960
and it was such a small space,

159
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,840
Adia had to keep going

160
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,800
because there's a whole line of cars behind her.

161
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,920
So she keeps on going down the road.

162
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,240
I pull over and I start the troubleshooting, right?

163
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,560
I head outside and these vehicles,

164
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,840
boom, boom, boom.

165
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,860
They're blasting past me 65, 70 miles per hour.

166
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,140
There's no room on the shoulder,

167
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,480
but of course that's the side,

168
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,400
the driver's side where I was pulled over

169
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,240
that was next to the road.

170
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,720
That's the side where the water bay is at.

171
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,400
And I can just see water pouring out of the water bay.

172
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,520
And I go, God.

173
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,640
So I have to open up the storage bay,

174
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,960
which is like in the road.

175
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,200
It's in the highway.

176
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,640
Cause there's just no room here.

177
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,340
And my phone starts blowing up and I think,

178
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,700
okay, this is Adia.

179
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,000
So I tap on the notification.

180
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I opened up, no, no, of course not.

181
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,800
It was a super nasty telegram.

182
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,200
Something got somebody upset

183
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,840
that someone else said on another JB show.

184
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,140
And I of course had enabled this comment

185
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,840
because they were on the JB airwaves.

186
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,320
And so I was an awful person.

187
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,360
And here I'm just getting like this really nasty message

188
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,380
and I'm standing on the side of the road,

189
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,140
water's pouring out of my RV.

190
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,360
I got a sick kid.

191
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,720
It's his birthday, right?

192
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,880
I'm in full dad mode,

193
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,940
just trying to save a birthday road trip.

194
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,340
I'm getting chewed out for something

195
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,040
someone else said on another show.

196
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,280
And I realized I've screwed up here.

197
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,060
I've made some bad choices.

198
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,720
Like this didn't come in via like the contact form.

199
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,760
It didn't come in like via boost,

200
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,680
not using any of the systems that we've built

201
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,800
to let us manage how and when

202
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,600
like super emotionally charged criticism comes in.

203
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,800
Because the way you do this over the longterm

204
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,860
is you realize I'm not in the head space

205
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,400
to be really criticized right now,

206
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,240
to be told I'm the worst person on the planet.

207
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,680
Maybe I'll put that off, right?

208
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,400
Cause this wasn't the right time.

209
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,760
Yeah, I mean like, you know,

210
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
before you go look at one of our videos on YouTube,

211
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,160
like you prepare yourself for that.

212
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,000
Right, yeah.

213
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,320
Yeah, or like I sit down when I'm in the right space

214
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,200
and I read the feedback and I prepare it

215
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,360
and I bring it into the shows and it's a task that I do.

216
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,320
But I way overshot on my availability.

217
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,140
And this moment really brings it in, right?

218
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,320
Cause there's a super emotionally charged message.

219
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,520
There's no way for me to choose

220
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,240
if this is the right time for this or not.

221
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,400
So I gotta make some significant changes in that regard.

222
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,760
I hate to do it.

223
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
After 15 years though,

224
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,840
I think I've got to restructure how this is gonna work,

225
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,820
but I'll figure that out later.

226
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,000
I had a problem to solve, right?

227
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,660
I'm on the side of the road.

228
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,040
Vehicles are blasting by me.

229
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm like opening up the bay.

230
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,480
I'm looking at what's going wrong.

231
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,120
I'm like trying to troubleshoot it

232
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,280
and radioing my wife to see if I can get her to turn around.

233
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,120
She's already coming on her way back.

234
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
And I realized I'm looking at it.

235
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,800
And like what's happening is my water bay,

236
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,440
which is a storage bay in my RV,

237
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,400
is like turning into a bathtub.

238
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,480
And with my pump,

239
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,720
the water pump that takes it from our fresh tank

240
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,520
and supplies it to all the faucets,

241
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,320
the water pump is just like pouring water out of the pump.

242
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,960
And it's like cracked wide open.

243
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,280
And we had just filled up like 75 gallons of water.

244
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,600
So there's a lot of water to go.

245
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,600
And I'm like, oh man, this is a big waste of water.

246
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
That's no good.

247
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,160
That really matters to us.

248
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,480
But of course the other big problem was

249
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,480
is we were heading to an off-grid spot.

250
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
So we needed this water.

251
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,200
There's no water out there for us to drink.

252
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,760
We wouldn't last a day out there.

253
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,080
A functioning water system was kind of part of the plan.

254
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,020
So I try to get my big ass 40 foot RV

255
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,860
back onto the highway from a dead stop.

256
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,120
I do a quick turnaround in a driveway,

257
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,560
like whipping this thing around like it's a sedan.

258
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,940
And I head back to a friend's house

259
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,260
where they had a driveway I knew we could work in.

260
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,480
And Hadi and I just sort of sat down and decided,

261
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,880
we got to solve this ourselves.

262
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,480
Because every shop is closed.

263
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,160
It's a Saturday.

264
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,440
They won't let us in for months.

265
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,080
We've already tried to, we knew this thing

266
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,840
was starting to have problems.

267
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,240
We tried to get it replaced weeks ago.

268
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,920
Oh, wow.

269
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,960
Everybody's like, well, we could see a mid-June,

270
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,160
early September.

271
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
I'm like, no.

272
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,880
No, so we just thought, you know what?

273
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,680
We have got to do the work to replace this thing.

274
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,240
So that's what we did in a driveway.

275
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,200
Thankfully, we already had a spare pump.

276
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,240
It was just a matter of getting it installed.

277
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,840
Come on.

278
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,720
Yeah, there you go.

279
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,220
You got it.

280
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,720
You got it.

281
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,220
Yeah.

282
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,920
Oh, that's good.

283
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,080
Nicely done.

284
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,320
That'll be a lot easier.

285
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,240
Now, we've got to get back in that same spot.

286
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,400
Yeah.

287
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,240
And then somehow fit the drill back in there.

288
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,520
Oh, god.

289
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,240
It's a tight fit.

290
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,400
So we're trying to get a new pump installed

291
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,840
that we thankfully already had, but didn't exactly

292
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,620
plan to do it right now.

293
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,640
And we're trying to improvise and get it installed,

294
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,640
but it doesn't fit.

295
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,160
Like, it's not the same size.

296
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,480
And so, well, we're coming up with solutions on the fly,

297
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,560
as they say.

298
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,120
No time like the present.

299
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,880
We did, ultimately, we got it installed.

300
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,440
What?

301
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,640
Nicely done.

302
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,720
I think the best moment was we had all the tools,

303
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,840
and we'd already owned the pump, so we had that.

304
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,040
So we really, it was just a matter of finding a way

305
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,720
to plug up the tank, so that way the tank didn't completely

306
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,800
drain the remainder all over us while we were swapping.

307
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,840
And so you could actually do the work?

308
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,960
Yeah, right.

309
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,080
And we had just the right sized cap that just perfectly

310
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,360
plugged that hose.

311
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,120
So it was for something else, like a random cap

312
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,200
that was just around the RV?

313
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,720
Yeah.

314
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,640
So it held the water back while we did the work,

315
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,560
so it was way less messy than we were expecting it.

316
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,400
And so, ultimately, we got it all put together.

317
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,360
And I think we got back on the road

318
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,360
and ended up at the campsite in the woods

319
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,520
probably earlier than if we would have made it to Oregon,

320
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:06,920
you know what I mean?

321
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,040
Like if we'd stuck to the original plan.

322
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,120
So even with everything that went wrong, wow.

323
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,640
Yeah.

324
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,600
And it's been a great time.

325
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,560
I didn't realize, like, oh, I miss

326
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,640
going out to my favorite spot in the woods.

327
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,520
We got a good cell signal, so we can still stay connected.

328
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,040
And it's springtime.

329
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,680
It's fantastic.

330
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,720
There's bears.

331
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,440
There's elk.

332
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,200
There's cows.

333
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
There's bunnies.

334
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,720
There's a river.

335
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,920
And the water right now is crystal clear, crystal clear

336
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,720
river water, Wes.

337
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,920
You can see the bottom of the river.

338
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,320
And just the right kind of temperatures, too.

339
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,400
It's not too hot, but you can get a little warm in the sun,

340
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,680
but it's crisp outside.

341
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,920
We probably spent three, four hours outside yesterday.

342
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,400
Got a new grill that we set up.

343
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,280
It turned out to be really, really nice.

344
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
So I'm glad we did it.

345
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,680
And it always is a great opportunity

346
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,160
to think about things.

347
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,920
And one of the things that's on our minds right now

348
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,840
is we are rebuilding the Jupiter Broadcasting website.

349
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,520
And we have begun a conversation with the community

350
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,640
in the new Office Hours podcast.

351
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,040
OfficeHours.hair, if you haven't checked that out yet,

352
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,560
that's what was available, OfficeHours.hair.

353
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,360
The episode where we kick this off is New Website Energy.

354
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,240
Myself, Wes, Alex, and Brent sit down,

355
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,640
and we kick around our goals for the new website.

356
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,000
But the great thing that happened,

357
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,400
this is exactly what I was hoping would happen with Office

358
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,320
Hours, is once we opened up to the community,

359
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,320
we started getting new ideas of stuff we never even considered,

360
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,400
which could open up our production and some

361
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,960
of our back end stuff to the community

362
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,400
and help in a way I never even thought about until somebody

363
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,280
suggested something.

364
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,360
So that conversation is just kicking off

365
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,800
on how we're going to rebuild the JB website, what features

366
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,120
it's going to have.

367
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,880
If you want to participate in that,

368
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,640
go check out episode three of OfficeHours.hair,

369
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,380
and then join us for the next live stream.

370
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,880
I'm doing these on Tuesdays as an opportunity

371
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
for the community to get together and hang out,

372
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,400
ask questions, and suggest stuff.

373
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,880
So join us on Tuesday the 10th at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

374
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,120
And we'll cover some of the feedback on that.

375
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,400
See you in the office.

376
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,280
See you in my office.

377
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,120
Yeah, and there is a GitHub that Brent has set up

378
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,400
that has conversations and threads going.

379
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,680
Is there anything we need to let people know about that,

380
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,240
like where to go and stuff, Brent?

381
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,000
Well, I think the best place to go

382
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,160
would just be the Jupyter Broadcasting GitHub,

383
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,160
and we have a little like jupyterbroadcasting.com.

384
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,560
What do you call them, projects?

385
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,480
I'm still new to this.

386
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,100
Yeah, there's a repo, there's a project,

387
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,220
and there's a discussion focused specifically

388
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,080
around OfficeHours episode three.

389
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,120
Oh, thanks, Wes.

390
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Yeah, and there's some great ideas being bounced around

391
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,600
there.

392
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,040
I've been, it's way better than Reddit.

393
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,240
Go there instead.

394
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,520
It's really great stuff.

395
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:51,640
I want to talk about this new gaming snap that Canonical is

396
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,680
going all in on the gaming experience on Ubuntu.

397
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,920
And we've started building out a team dedicated

398
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,280
to working on just that.

399
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,560
They have a call out for testing on a new Steam

400
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,120
snap, which brings along everything

401
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,920
you need to run Steam games via Proton,

402
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,800
they write, or of course, native Linux games.

403
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,360
You and I both noticed, too, that at the Linux App Summit

404
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,760
that was going on this weekend, Canonical

405
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,640
was definitely mentioning the fact

406
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,000
that they had open positions.

407
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,920
They mentioned it.

408
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,360
Yes, very much so.

409
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,160
Big QR codes up on their slides, go apply here.

410
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,600
I guess it's very exciting to see, right?

411
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,760
It is a great idea.

412
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,280
I am thrilled to see Canonical working on the desktop.

413
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,360
At the same time, I'm just shaking my head.

414
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,320
Like they just had a round of really embarrassing

415
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,920
social media coverage of their archaic hiring process.

416
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,880
And then, of course, this announcement

417
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,400
comes on the heels of everyone being really pissed off

418
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,800
about the Firefox snap.

419
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,320
And it just kind of kills all of the momentum and shine,

420
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,000
in my opinion, of this announcement.

421
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,040
Yeah, it's really a complicated time to try to announce this

422
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
and get the kind of response from the community

423
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,880
that I'm sure they were hoping for that I'd like to see.

424
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,560
Because yeah, I mean, Ubuntu is the most popular Linux desktop,

425
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,040
especially around people who might eventually

426
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,240
want to try gaming on there.

427
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,240
So it matters if we can make this default experience really

428
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,280
good.

429
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,600
It's just complicated.

430
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,720
And our chat room is talking about it right now.

431
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,040
They're aware of these things.

432
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,080
So here's what I think happens.

433
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,400
I think Canonical lives within their own little echo chamber.

434
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,160
And I think they tell themselves something kind of like this.

435
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,600
Well, Ubuntu has more desktop market share

436
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,480
than all of the other distributions combined.

437
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,200
So if we just ship something as default on Ubuntu,

438
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,720
then by its very nature, it'll have millions of users.

439
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,480
And it doesn't really matter if the chattering class online

440
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,120
and in social media and on YouTube

441
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,600
don't like it because these millions of, quote unquote,

442
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,600
average users will just use the default, quote unquote.

443
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,000
And you see this pattern of thinking

444
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,320
from Canonical frequently.

445
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,080
Sometimes it serves them.

446
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,320
Sometimes it doesn't.

447
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,760
I think in the case of the Firefox snap,

448
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,360
yeah, that's probably an accurate statement.

449
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,840
I think in the case of gaming, they're kidding themselves.

450
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,080
And it really shows how out of touch they are.

451
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,720
First of all, Linux gamers are the exact type

452
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,400
of user who's willing to use some crappy script to optimize

453
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,000
their system for better games.

454
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,680
And if that script maybe replaces

455
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
a snap with a flat pack or a deb,

456
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,400
so that way their launch times are faster,

457
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,880
they're going to do it.

458
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,000
This is the enthusiast market.

459
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,120
This is the kind of market where these things matter.

460
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,760
And I think the other thing that shows

461
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,080
how out of touch Canonical is, especially

462
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,720
with this particular crowd, is they

463
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,280
did this out of the wrong order.

464
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,120
They did this out of order.

465
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,960
I think what they should have done

466
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,320
is they should have got these positions filled first.

467
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
Get these people hired.

468
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Imagine applying for a job where the company is already

469
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,300
two miles down the road on the project

470
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,160
you're going to be working on.

471
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,860
And so you just come on board, and you're basically

472
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,160
inheriting whatever they've already started,

473
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,280
even if they don't have any insights

474
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,800
or they aren't doing it right.

475
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,560
And here's an example.

476
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,280
Not only did they launch this snap

477
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,320
without everything complete for it to actually work properly,

478
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,600
but they clearly are not thinking beyond Steam.

479
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,240
There's no accounting for things like Lutris or bottles,

480
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,720
which is another big part of the Linux gaming ecosystem.

481
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,280
But they don't have any plans for that.

482
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,560
They maybe don't even know what those things are.

483
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,640
It's hard to tell.

484
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,520
It does kind of make me wonder, like, yes,

485
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,600
purely on how do we address making gaming the best

486
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,640
in whatever ways are possible for our users?

487
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,040
Or, you know, is it complicated

488
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,440
by some of their own internal directives

489
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,840
and things they're trying to accomplish?

490
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,200
It's like, wait for these hires,

491
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,480
so that way these experts can give you

492
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,680
an informed guidance on how to do this.

493
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,200
But also, get a W, bro.

494
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,120
Get, like, a single W.

495
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,580
Get a single win for snaps in this community's eyes.

496
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,360
Get, you know, we don't care if a snap of one package

497
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,760
has 10X the users of a flat pack.

498
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,520
None of us care.

499
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,840
Get a W, bro.

500
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,800
Get a win.

501
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,040
Fix the launch times.

502
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,240
Fix the launch times.

503
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,480
It's something you need to do anyways.

504
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,280
Show us you're listening.

505
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,480
Get a win.

506
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,200
You get these people hired,

507
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,320
you help them inform the roadmap,

508
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,760
and you get a snap win.

509
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,040
And then you say, by the way, everybody,

510
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,560
we're now launching a gaming snap.

511
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,440
Instead, what they did is they've got this cart

512
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,120
before the horse, before they've even made their hires.

513
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,360
They've made this gaming snap

514
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,080
that wasn't even functional when it first launched,

515
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,560
but thankfully, a former employee of theirs

516
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,640
that was familiar with how snaps work

517
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,600
helped them realize the bits it was missing

518
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,840
to actually function correctly.

519
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,720
You can find a link to that in our show notes.

520
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,680
I think you can probably guess

521
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,280
who one of those employees was.

522
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,400
So they launched this incomplete product.

523
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
They don't even have the staff on board.

524
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,280
And then the other question is, why now?

525
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,400
Why in 2022 when these things aren't in place?

526
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,680
Why not three years ago before SteamOS 3 was created

527
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,240
and they pivoted to Arch?

528
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,640
Why do you care now?

529
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Do you care now because all of a sudden Valve

530
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,520
has made something that's not based on Ubuntu

531
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,800
and so this is a reactionary thing?

532
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,200
Help me understand these things.

533
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,920
And this is my last point.

534
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,520
I think Canonical doesn't have the way

535
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,400
to properly advocate for this anymore.

536
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
These questions I'm asking,

537
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,480
somebody savvy should have been out ahead of this,

538
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,800
laying the groundwork in the community.

539
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,760
That's how it used to happen.

540
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,320
Strong community interaction.

541
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,600
And because snaps face such a massive headwind

542
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,040
from the community, they gotta get out there

543
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,920
because what's gonna happen is there will be guides,

544
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,080
there will be YouTubes, there will be forum posts,

545
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,480
there will be links on Twitter that tell you

546
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,000
how to undo all of this work

547
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,200
that they are going to invest multiple staff hours into.

548
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,280
Lots of development time.

549
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,400
And by the way, it's not Valve packaging this,

550
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,280
so it's not like they're building

551
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,680
some great relationship with Valve either.

552
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,400
They're packaging it outside of Valve.

553
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,240
It's questionable if we even want that.

554
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,200
So they're gonna do all of this

555
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,800
and they're gonna put it out there

556
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,400
and then because the community hates what they create,

557
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,840
in 35 seconds there will be scripts to replace

558
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,400
and undo all of the work they've done.

559
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,960
So I ask again, why are they doing it now this way?

560
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,000
If this was something that they shoved down

561
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,800
average quote unquote user's throats

562
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,640
and they didn't have any choice like Firefox,

563
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,840
yeah, it would work.

564
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,720
But again, I argue the Linux gaming market

565
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,320
is a little bit different.

566
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,960
They're willing to install extensions

567
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,360
that help set the performance governor on their PC.

568
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,720
They understand what a performance governor is.

569
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,360
Not all of them.

570
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,200
But let's look at the people

571
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,360
that are likely to game on Linux.

572
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,480
If they can grok what Proton is and why they need Proton,

573
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,600
then they can grok what a Bash script is.

574
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,560
Is there a version of this where maybe that's not

575
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,720
who Canonical thinks they're trying to target?

576
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,240
Is it aimed more at the folks

577
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,160
who know that Linux gaming is complicated,

578
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
kind of have heard of Proton

579
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,280
but don't wanna figure that out

580
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,280
and are willing to just hit,

581
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,520
I want steam from the snore

582
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,640
and then I'm gonna try to play my games?

583
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,480
Yeah, it's definitely probably gonna be the majority

584
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,840
of who ends up using it, right?

585
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,720
Sort of a stem the tide of those folks

586
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,280
who might otherwise see themselves

587
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,160
as being forced to go to something like Pop or Garuda.

588
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,840
Here's what I think you end up with though,

589
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,960
is the worst of both worlds in that scenario.

590
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,520
You end up for Canonical with just enough users

591
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,360
where now you're forced to maintain this thing,

592
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,280
but not enough users

593
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,600
where you can exert any kind of influence.

594
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,440
There's no influence they can exert over Valve

595
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,640
or the direction of any way this goes.

596
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,200
And now that Valve has their own platform to develop on,

597
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,960
they don't even need anything from Canonical.

598
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,120
So Canonical is always going to be chasing the developments

599
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,800
on SteamOS now to try to bundle it up in a snap.

600
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,280
And again, it just doesn't seem like

601
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,520
they have the insights into the market.

602
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,760
Like what are they gonna do about Lutris here?

603
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,200
It's not a complete gaming picture.

604
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,480
It's not a solution right now.

605
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,160
Are they going to include AMD drivers

606
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,640
and the GUIs to manage AMD cards?

607
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,560
What about Nvidia stuff?

608
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,880
Like where does this go?

609
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,000
I suppose I love the idea

610
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,400
if snaps were better received and launched faster.

611
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,360
Then I'm like, this is a pretty solid idea.

612
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,880
Like at least there is a real good solution

613
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,120
for users of the Ubuntu desktop.

614
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,600
However, I'd also feel a lot better

615
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,600
if it was being created and packaged and maintained by Valve.

616
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
Wouldn't this be the great solution?

617
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Like here's a solution for Ubuntu users.

618
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,240
It's like the blessed SteamOS environment all in a snap.

619
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,480
Or at least we felt like there was some involvement,

620
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,920
some handshake or some co-press release,

621
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,760
something to say like,

622
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,800
oh, we're excited to see better support on Ubuntu

623
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,360
or something that made you feel like

624
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,000
it wasn't just a total Canonical move in a vacuum.

625
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,440
Yeah.

626
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,440
I hope that this turns out

627
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,800
at least somewhat positive for them

628
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,480
because like I said at the start of this,

629
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,320
it is exciting to see them put any effort like this

630
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,920
and hire like this for a desktop project.

631
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,120
Yeah, I mean, hiring, head count, that means money.

632
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,000
So you're right, it is exciting.

633
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,120
It's just interesting that this is where

634
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,640
they're doing that investment

635
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,200
and not investing to where the puck is skating, right?

636
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,760
This is now a solved problem

637
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,400
in part because some opportunity was missed

638
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,440
and Valve switched to Arch.

639
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,520
It's not really the problem we need solved now.

640
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,280
I mean, gaming on Linux could always be better,

641
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,000
but it's better than it ever has been.

642
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,080
Wouldn't it be great if they were launching a strike team

643
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,800
to solve another problem on the Linux desktop

644
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,480
that wasn't as well off as gaming was right now?

645
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,800
That seems like there's other problems

646
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,080
that maybe they could address in a way

647
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,560
that they would have some particular leverage in.

648
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,800
Yeah.

649
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,440
And I could come up with a list right off the top of my head.

650
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,520
Things from like pipe wire to fonts to printing,

651
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,000
there's so many areas that we could just really nail

652
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
for the end user.

653
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,680
But what we're gonna solve is Linux gaming,

654
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,800
which is already a small niche of the Linux market

655
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,640
and has already been directly addressed

656
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,680
by the primary vendor in the ecosystem.

657
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,560
And then you just add something like Lutris and bottles

658
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,920
and you're pretty much good to go.

659
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,400
I struggle with it, but I'm open to feedback on this.

660
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,320
Send us a boost or go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

661
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,480
I do feel like we should probably give it a try.

662
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,680
Maybe it's not quite yet ready,

663
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,120
but a little bit down the line

664
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,360
when it's made a little more generally available.

665
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,200
I'll be curious.

666
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,680
You know, I do end up gaming on Pop

667
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,640
at the moment in a fair bit.

668
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,520
And while I still think I would, you know,

669
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,360
kind of like what Pop's been doing lately,

670
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,120
so I might be inclined to install it anyway.

671
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,840
If I could go, you know, just install the latest Ubuntu,

672
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,440
couple of clicks in the store and have steam up and going,

673
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,640
there is something valuable that,

674
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,280
or if I'm trying to convince, save my brother

675
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,280
to finally get off his Windows desktop for gaming.

676
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,640
Maybe, but I don't know.

677
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,920
That's a long road and it needs to launch decently.

678
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,240
Linode.com slash unplugged.

679
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,080
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

680
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,640
And you go there to support the show.

681
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,480
That's right.

682
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,320
That's how it works.

683
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,000
Linode started in 2003 because they saw that

684
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,600
Linux had this great thing coming called virtualization.

685
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,520
What a concept.

686
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,760
And now 19 years later,

687
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,120
they have built one of the absolute best platforms

688
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,600
for developers, Linux enthusiasts, businesses,

689
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,560
and your everyday users.

690
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,920
And I make that qualification

691
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,840
because if you just want to run a personal portfolio,

692
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,600
they have $5 a month systems.

693
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,760
You want to run your own MumbleBox

694
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,440
or maybe your own Jitsi or GitLab now,

695
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,240
especially with GitLab making some pricing changes.

696
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,760
In fact, Linode has one click GitLab deployments,

697
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,080
which are really, really handy.

698
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,360
But really at the end of the day,

699
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,080
Linode is just about making things simple

700
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,160
and straightforward and accessible.

701
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,520
So if you want to do a one click, you can,

702
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,640
or if you want to deploy some just absolutely

703
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,400
bananas infrastructure that can scale up

704
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,000
to millions of users or at least one busy Synapse server,

705
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,960
you absolutely can do that too.

706
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,240
They just have the best in class experience

707
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,960
and performance and customer support.

708
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,920
There's a lot of places that offer hosting,

709
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,240
but nobody gets the mix right like Linode does.

710
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,920
And then you add that $100 offer,

711
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,880
it's just a great way to try it out and support the show.

712
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,520
They got all the distributions you're going to want to try.

713
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,720
Like they've already got 2204 up there

714
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,960
if you want to give that a go.

715
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,440
They're always rolling out the new Alma's

716
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,480
when those are ready to go.

717
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,520
We run Nextcloud up there like a fricking champ, dude.

718
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,920
It's excellent.

719
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,680
It is the best, most reliable implementation

720
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,120
I've ever had of Nextcloud.

721
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,040
And I'm going to admit part of that is we're using

722
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,480
the object storage that Linode has as our backend storage.

723
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,520
And that's been a game changer for us.

724
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,440
But now we're looking at like all kinds of things

725
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,920
that we might want to use for internal tools,

726
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,040
like a Mattermost server, a Jitsi replacement,

727
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,440
and we can just run it all in the same box

728
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,480
because these things are so fast.

729
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,520
They got MVME storage, they got Epic processors

730
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,400
when you go to the high-end CPU ones,

731
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,640
but they also do have high-end GPU systems.

732
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,520
It's like great, man.

733
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,680
And the interface is so slick that you

734
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,640
can work with any of it.

735
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,000
And then once you've been using it for a while,

736
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,680
you start using things like the command line

737
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,280
tool and the API, and it's just total fire.

738
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,720
I absolutely love it.

739
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
And it's so nice to just get in, get out,

740
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,720
get things done super quick, spin things up and try it out,

741
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,760
decide if we want to use it or not, then destroy the box.

742
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,520
I use it for that kind of thing all the time.

743
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,240
Go try it.

744
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,480
Go learn something.

745
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,600
Support the show.

746
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,600
It's super quick to get started, so do it right now

747
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,760
by going to linode.com slash unplugged.

748
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,240
Get that $100 credit, and you support the show.

749
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,640
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

750
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,920
I thought it'd be fun if we busted out that old Linux time

751
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,960
machine.

752
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,560
Is there something you might change

753
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,080
in how you got introduced to Linux,

754
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,360
the things you've played with, the mistakes you've made?

755
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,920
Now, do be careful, though, because it's

756
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,600
powered by a Raspberry Pi, first generation.

757
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:26,480
Oh, well, here we are back in the late 90s.

758
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,960
So if I had a Linux time machine, which, of course,

759
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,040
I do, obviously.

760
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,720
We just used it.

761
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,640
It's called ZFS.

762
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,280
Yeah, it's a time snapshot.

763
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,000
I like that.

764
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,640
That's what we should have gone with.

765
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,600
I was thinking about this.

766
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,800
Like, if I was to look back, like,

767
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,960
did I ever make a choice that kind of sent me off

768
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,360
on a tangent for the wrong time or something like that?

769
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,640
And I think maybe I probably focused too much on the desktop.

770
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,480
And I know that sounds weird because I love the desktop.

771
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,280
But the server side of Linux is like infinitely,

772
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,560
it's like infinite jobs.

773
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,720
There's so many jobs if you learn the Linux side.

774
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,920
There's so many things you can build.

775
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,400
It's like the equivalent of learning

776
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,440
how to develop software.

777
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,080
You can really build and create things

778
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,380
when you learn the server side.

779
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,920
And not that I haven't, but I think

780
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,000
maybe that would have made me more inclined to look

781
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,040
at things like Nix sooner and stuff like that.

782
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,880
It's been around for a decade.

783
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,680
And I'm just now getting to it.

784
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,920
And so I was looking at that.

785
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,600
Like, why did it take me so long?

786
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,080
But you have tried pretty much every desktop environment

787
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,640
known to humankind.

788
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
Exactly.

789
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,880
So I think I did a lot of jumping around with the desktop,

790
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,280
fooling around with my desktop.

791
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,480
When I look back at it, it sort of feels like wasted time.

792
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,840
But I don't really know for sure.

793
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,760
Maybe it was necessary.

794
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,080
I mean, I sure managed to turn it into a lot of content.

795
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,120
But I think overall, it probably wasn't the most efficient use

796
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,640
of my time.

797
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,080
I had a lot of fun, though, so I could still

798
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,280
make an argument for it.

799
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,480
But I would tweak that.

800
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Yeah, I think that's probably it.

801
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,060
I was going to say less distro hopping,

802
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,440
but that was also kind of essential for the show.

803
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,240
So for me, it would have been fine to sit.

804
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,360
I would like sit down with my younger self.

805
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,920
And I'd say, here's the state of affairs, man.

806
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,760
I know this is all looking really good.

807
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,440
But then in a few years, there's going

808
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,240
to be this fork in the road, where this thing called

809
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,640
Unity comes out.

810
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,000
And this KDE goes to KDE 4.

811
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,320
And that's going to be real rough.

812
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,080
And then GNOME, you're not even going

813
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,400
to believe what the GNOME folks do.

814
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,240
And I'm going to say, GNOME, you mean Gnome?

815
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,640
No, no, we call it GNOME now.

816
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,920
Oh, I'm going to say it's weird.

817
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,760
But you're going to just brace yourself,

818
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,420
because that's just the very beginning.

819
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,680
And just keep your head down and build.

820
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,560
And don't get distracted by all that.

821
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,400
I'm imagining you trying to explain also

822
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,200
the rise of mobile and being like,

823
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,080
well, OK, so Linux is on the phone,

824
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,000
but not in a way that your future self is

825
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,680
going to like at all.

826
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,880
It's a complicated future.

827
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,960
And the desktop isn't as relevant as you really

828
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,920
think it's going to be.

829
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,160
That is, I think, the key piece to this.

830
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,480
And I'm really glad you just put words to that is,

831
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,400
that's the other bit I'd have to say to myself.

832
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,520
It's like, the worst part is it's not

833
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,000
going to really matter.

834
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,780
By the time you get to the 2020s,

835
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,840
you could use any distro or really any operating system.

836
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,560
And all of your tools pretty much work,

837
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,800
because everything's going to be in the web.

838
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,000
And I'm going to be like, what?

839
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,800
I hate web apps.

840
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,280
I'm like, no, you still will.

841
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,880
Absolutely, that will not change.

842
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,720
Yes, you still hate web apps, but everything's

843
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,880
in a web browser now.

844
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,920
Pluses and minuses, right?

845
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,600
It's really kind of weird.

846
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,760
But I would also like, I know, to tell myself

847
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,520
about things like process namespaces and containers.

848
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,100
And just honestly, the thing that still blows my mind

849
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,200
the most from back then to today is just

850
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,920
how radically available server resources are.

851
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:44,480
And if you weren't around in the early 90s and the early aughts

852
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,960
and deploying servers, you really

853
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,000
don't understand, to even get a server going,

854
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,560
well, there was an approval process.

855
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,200
There's a hardware purchase that has to happen,

856
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,560
which means you have to work with a vendor and a sales rep.

857
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,480
And then they spec you something.

858
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,960
You go back and forth on that for a couple of days.

859
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,840
And then you order it.

860
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,260
And then weeks go by.

861
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,840
And depending on the vendor, sometimes the machine back then

862
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,360
didn't even show up assembled.

863
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,960
The parts would arrive separately.

864
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,760
And then you still had to assemble it all together

865
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,600
back then.

866
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,120
And then you had to install rails.

867
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,560
And you had to go put it into a rack.

868
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,000
And these things are heavy.

869
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,600
It's like they made them out of cement.

870
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,440
And then you had to wire it all up and manage the wiring

871
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,320
and provision the switch port.

872
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,880
Do you get where I'm going with this?

873
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,200
It's like a multi-month process.

874
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,760
And then if you were in somebody else's data center,

875
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,840
you not only paid for your bandwidth, the actual amount

876
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,200
of bandwidth that you used, but you actually

877
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,640
paid for the power, all of it.

878
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,000
Like, oh, yeah, screw you if you accidentally

879
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,040
messed up the backup system and all the systems

880
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,680
do an extra backup that night.

881
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,160
You just totally killed your budget.

882
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,400
It was ridiculous.

883
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,220
And now I can spin up servers via an API on the command line.

884
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,000
And it's up on this infrastructure

885
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,960
that's way more powerful than anything

886
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,000
I'd ever have access to.

887
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,360
Right, and we can customize it to run around kernels,

888
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,600
switch it over to NixOS.

889
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,280
It's not like the old days of shared hosting either.

890
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,880
Yeah, and I don't know how I'd even

891
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,360
relay it to my younger self, but you know.

892
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,680
Can you give yourself an SSH session

893
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,440
that goes forward in time?

894
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,120
Yeah, a tunnel through time.

895
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,000
That would be pretty rad, actually.

896
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
If I ever figure that out, I'll let you know.

897
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,680
Just go check out, have your past self check out

898
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,080
our matrix box.

899
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,480
You'd be very impressed by the matrix server.

900
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,200
That would be.

901
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,000
All right, let's bring it back to the present.

902
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,280
So it was actually Brent who discovered the Linux time

903
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,880
machine and dusted it off and said,

904
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,040
guys, we've got to go back in time

905
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,240
and save our former selves.

906
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,160
And I said, Brent, if we go back in time,

907
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,000
we're going to undo the shows, right?

908
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,680
Because you never know what could happen.

909
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,280
And Brent, you were the one that was explaining,

910
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,160
we're actually just forking the universe.

911
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,880
So it's just alternate reality that's getting all messed up.

912
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,480
Yeah, it's fine.

913
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,760
There are infinite possibilities anyways, right, guys?

914
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,280
Yeah, so we're just altering one of those infinite possibilities.

915
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,560
Are you ready to go back in time to your former Linux self,

916
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,120
Brent?

917
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,640
Sure.

918
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:04,520
You know, my younger Linux self didn't actually

919
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,520
grasp onto Linux as soon as I would hope I would have.

920
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,520
So me, the me Linux guy now, I think

921
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,640
sees that I dabbled in Linux quite a lot

922
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,640
before really grabbing onto it.

923
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,200
Many years before I switched my entire business

924
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,640
to open source stuff, I was playing with this stuff

925
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:34,040
and just as kind of a curiosity, but never really latched on.

926
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,640
And I wish, I think, that I would have said, no, no,

927
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,760
grab this right now.

928
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,520
If you do, it'll really change things for you.

929
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,680
Don't wait the, I don't know, eight or seven years

930
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,880
down the road to do it.

931
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,880
Do it right away.

932
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,360
And who knows where that could have led a Brent these days?

933
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,560
I mean, I think I'm fine with who I am now.

934
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,920
But just imagine you could grasp some of those technologies

935
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,000
maybe eight years sooner.

936
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,480
Maybe, Chris, I'd be almost as experienced or as you

937
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,600
or Wes, perhaps.

938
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,000
And so that being said, I wish that I also

939
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,880
latched onto those communities a little sooner at the same time.

940
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,400
So just thinking going to Linux Fest Northwest

941
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,040
really made things flourish for me

942
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,840
in terms of meeting people, like-minded people.

943
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,440
And so I think the theme for me is just

944
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,680
doing it a little bit sooner.

945
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,720
Do you think there's anything that might have some hurdles

946
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,680
you might have to help your old self overcome?

947
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,080
I'm just thinking maybe if you were starting more

948
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,880
of your photography journey back then,

949
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,760
the tooling probably wasn't quite as good as it is

950
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,480
on modern desktop Linux, amongst a ton of other things.

951
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,680
And I imagine there are probably reasons for the time

952
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,800
that maybe you didn't dive in right away.

953
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,640
I think part of it was complexity, actually,

954
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,680
now that I think about it.

955
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,040
Back then with dependency issues,

956
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,000
I ran into those almost immediately

957
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
when I was trying to install some software

958
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,760
and even installing it the way that was intended.

959
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,880
Do you remember those days of the so-called dependency hell?

960
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,000
It made me hate RPM back in the day.

961
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,600
I feel like you're looking back at your younger self.

962
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,760
Thanks for bringing us along in the time machine.

963
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,240
You know what I'm seeing as I look around your room here,

964
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,480
Brent?

965
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,880
I'm seeing a lot going on.

966
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,800
And I'm not seeing a particular problem

967
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
you had to solve with Linux.

968
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,640
And I think that's something you can't be so hard on yourself

969
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,560
about.

970
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,560
You didn't really have something you needed Linux to fix

971
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,640
until it was time and then you switched.

972
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,200
And when we as a community think about advocacy

973
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,320
and we think about trying to get other people to switch

974
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,120
to Linux, I think we have to understand and realize

975
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,840
that a lot of times people don't necessarily feel a need

976
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:51,200
and they don't see a reason because everything's working fine.

977
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,480
They sort of have it good.

978
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,280
And for me, the problems I needed solving

979
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,720
dealt directly with server scaling in the late 90s that

980
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,560
was just a limit of the Windows technology stack back then.

981
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,200
And so I went looking somewhere else to handle the user load

982
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,520
that I was trying to deal with.

983
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,400
And so I discovered Linux that way.

984
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,000
And so a similar thing, like my very, very first use

985
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,880
with Linux, besides the time I deleted my file system,

986
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:26,040
so my second use with Linux was Microsoft had my school,

987
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,480
I was in high school at the time, they had us pinned down

988
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,120
and they were bullying my school.

989
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,360
And I've shared this story before.

990
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,960
And they didn't have a product that

991
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,000
would solve the really serious networking issues

992
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,320
that we were having and Squid Proxy did.

993
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,380
And so I set up a Debian box and I set up Squid Proxy.

994
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,640
And it was incredible.

995
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,840
And I remember thinking, wow, they can't even do this.

996
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,320
And so Microsoft, sort of a short aside,

997
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,520
Microsoft came while we're back in time,

998
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,040
they came at us because we had a special program with them.

999
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,600
And they said, you basically have an ultimate,

1000
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,480
they gave us an ultimatum and they said,

1001
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,600
you either try out this Windows NT5 beta thing

1002
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,800
and see if you can use the new proxy server

1003
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,200
that we have in that.

1004
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,240
They hadn't even named it Windows 2000 at this point.

1005
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,080
That's how far, that's how long ago this was.

1006
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,520
So we want you to try out this new NT5 beta

1007
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,920
and see if that doesn't solve the problem for you.

1008
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,240
And of course, it didn't.

1009
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,480
And so also we weren't going to deploy beta software

1010
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,200
for our whole network, for your whole production network.

1011
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,360
It was crazy.

1012
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,800
So Brent, I had a problem to solve.

1013
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,360
And I had a serious emergency problem to solve.

1014
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,040
And Windows, we took it to as far as we could

1015
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,280
before we ended up looking for somewhere else.

1016
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,440
For me, that was like, you know, 98, 99.

1017
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,120
But for you, it was just a different time

1018
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,240
where you had a problem to solve, right?

1019
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,080
I mean, I'm looking around.

1020
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,400
I don't think you should be so hard on yourself.

1021
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,760
I can understand.

1022
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,400
I think that's actually a really good point.

1023
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,560
When I did have a problem to solve

1024
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,800
and it was the clear solution,

1025
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,560
it was very easy to just dive right in.

1026
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,040
So I wonder then if we could turn the time machine dial

1027
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,800
a little more, maybe closer to the present

1028
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,240
and I can present just a little something else.

1029
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,240
Oh, was that a hand?

1030
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,080
That felt like a hand.

1031
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,680
It's close quarters in this time machine.

1032
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,920
It's only meant for one.

1033
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,440
Oh, I love this thing anyways, though.

1034
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,440
It's great.

1035
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,360
You know, one thing I've been thinking about lately

1036
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,680
is I wonder if my slightly younger self

1037
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,080
would want to learn different things.

1038
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,840
It feels to me like my self-learning journey,

1039
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,200
at least around sort of like sysadmini topics,

1040
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,720
you know, like SSHing and doing key pairs

1041
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,640
and trying to run a jellyfin server

1042
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,080
and all of these things.

1043
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,600
It has been at least very easy for me to find the sort of,

1044
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,680
don't be insulted anyone,

1045
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,080
but I'll call them the old Linux way of setting these up,

1046
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,160
you know, like not containers.

1047
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,360
Like installing a package

1048
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,320
or maybe even running an install script.

1049
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,000
App2Get or something.

1050
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1051
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,080
You see like tons of tutorials,

1052
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,880
tons of them with how to do things that way.

1053
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,480
And I wish maybe,

1054
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,000
and I'm willing to, you know, discuss this as well.

1055
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,400
I wish that maybe someone would have said,

1056
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,840
hey, by the way,

1057
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,920
there are these new ways of doing this stuff

1058
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,280
that maybe is a better way to go.

1059
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,600
Cause perhaps that's a better investment of your time.

1060
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,640
You know, containers and infrastructure as code

1061
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,040
and all these great, you know,

1062
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,920
the Nixie kind of stuff we're playing with.

1063
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,000
I kind of wish I had been introduced to that way sooner.

1064
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,280
I think that's probably a common feeling,

1065
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,880
but on the flip side,

1066
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,480
have you been pretty well served by the existing resources?

1067
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,160
I'm just thinking, you know, it's kind of amazing

1068
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,680
these days, especially you got a reliable VPS,

1069
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,000
your App2Get install a couple,

1070
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,520
you know, you got your NGINX web server,

1071
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,760
you got your program running,

1072
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,480
as many things as you might want to do differently.

1073
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,880
And there are many additional patterns like that.

1074
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,200
It sure does just work,

1075
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,160
especially if you only got a couple of things to manage.

1076
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,600
It's certainly well-tested, right?

1077
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah, you could build a career out of it.

1078
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,560
I think it's served me well,

1079
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,720
but only in that I don't know what I've been missing out on.

1080
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,600
Well, I mean, you're still young, Brentley, really,

1081
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,440
if you think about it, you know,

1082
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,160
if you think about it on that timescale,

1083
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,400
when you're 50 years old,

1084
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,000
you're going to have this stuff under your belt for decades.

1085
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,440
I assume Alex has got you setting up

1086
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,800
OpenShift clusters already.

1087
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,840
Oh, man, we better get him out of there.

1088
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,560
We better get him out of there.

1089
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,960
It's going to be bad.

1090
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,280
Thank you, Alex.

1091
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,960
So are you ready?

1092
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,760
Do you want to take the wheel on the time machine?

1093
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,600
Just be careful.

1094
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,880
When Brent drives, he adjusts the seat.

1095
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,840
Oh, I've driven with Brent before.

1096
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,600
Ah, where are we, Wes?

1097
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,840
I'm noticing kind of a different style of clothing,

1098
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,680
so it's far enough back.

1099
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,520
Well, you might notice, yeah,

1100
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,840
different animals around here, too.

1101
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,800
It's been a long time.

1102
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,640
Yeah, yeah.

1103
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,680
All right, tell us where we're at.

1104
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,960
Well, I figured we'd go back into a world

1105
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,520
where Wes had free time.

1106
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,360
Oh, yes.

1107
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,440
You know, remember those days?

1108
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,280
Yeah, back when I used to play with Gentoo.

1109
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,880
So that's what I want to talk,

1110
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,800
you said something earlier,

1111
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,760
you said something about distro hopping.

1112
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,600
Yeah.

1113
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
You know, I kind of wish I distro hopped less.

1114
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,160
I think the opposite.

1115
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,440
I wish that I had spent more time distro hopping,

1116
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,480
because thinking back on it, like some of the late nights

1117
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,600
where I was, you know, first figured out

1118
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,040
how to install Arch Linux,

1119
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,120
and before I had like, you know,

1120
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,600
I had like one netbook and not, you know,

1121
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,960
not a lot of fancy computer peripherals or networks

1122
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,920
or options besides the instructions I'd written down

1123
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,240
from my working installation to get this going.

1124
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,200
And just for also a little bit of context,

1125
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,400
what kind of internet speeds would you say

1126
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,280
we're looking at back then?

1127
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,480
Yeah, not great.

1128
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,160
Yeah, early DSL, maybe, or yeah.

1129
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,400
And I learned so much,

1130
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,120
and that was the right time when I was really,

1131
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,880
first kind of getting all the ways

1132
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,000
you could put a Linux system together.

1133
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,720
But I think that would have been a good time

1134
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,480
to really go deep into Gentoo

1135
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,080
or bother to do Linux from scratch.

1136
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,160
Not that you have to, not that I feel like I'm missing out

1137
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,040
by not having done it.

1138
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,160
And you know, there's a lot going on about a Linux system,

1139
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,400
and I don't need to be an expert in.

1140
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,000
But I'd like to do those things now.

1141
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,560
And that's one reason I've really enjoyed

1142
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,480
this NixOS challenge,

1143
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,560
is it felt like an excuse to kind of dabble a bit more,

1144
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,480
but there's just too many things to learn

1145
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,760
besides technology we want to deploy for, you know,

1146
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,680
to improve the shows, for work, for my own hobbies.

1147
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,720
Like, there's just not that much room.

1148
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,480
And because I'm so used to like, you know,

1149
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,600
I know my way around enough distros now,

1150
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,200
that's just never on the top of my thing to try,

1151
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,040
unfortunately.

1152
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,720
So you'd go over there and you'd tap yourself,

1153
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,800
your former self on the shoulder,

1154
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,840
and you'd go, go try out Gentoo for a while,

1155
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,880
go distro hop a bit.

1156
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,600
You know, it's time, it's slack wear.

1157
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,480
Right, you go, you know,

1158
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,280
go spread your distro hopping days out

1159
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,120
while you can now,

1160
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,480
because your time's going to be limited down the road.

1161
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,000
I definitely get where you're coming from

1162
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,560
because I had years of experience

1163
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,240
with Red Hat based systems and Debian based,

1164
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,920
well, Debian, before I tried Gentoo.

1165
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,320
And I felt like I finally learned Linux

1166
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,960
when I started building my Gentoo systems,

1167
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,640
because of the way I had to do the partitioning,

1168
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,480
the way I had to do the formatting,

1169
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,360
the way I had to bless the bootloader

1170
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,200
and install the bootloader,

1171
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,200
all the stuff that the installers

1172
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,120
had always been doing for me since day one.

1173
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,480
And including back then,

1174
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,000
you had to configure Xorg files.

1175
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,160
Oh yeah, right.

1176
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,680
And you know, a lot of distributions

1177
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,000
where they added value was in the installer

1178
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,160
and maybe walking you through setting up X

1179
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,120
and walking you through setting up your hardware interfaces

1180
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,360
and stuff like that.

1181
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,600
Whereas in Gentoo, depending on what stage you did,

1182
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,120
and I normally did a stage two install,

1183
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,880
you had to learn all that.

1184
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,680
And that's really when I started to get it, I think.

1185
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,280
And so I agree, you know.

1186
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,600
Maybe you're suddenly seeing like the config options

1187
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,760
for the kernel for the first time,

1188
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,800
and you're like, oh yeah, I can tweak these.

1189
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,440
Yeah, you know, that is a great point,

1190
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,200
is you really,

1191
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,240
learning how you put the whole kernel together

1192
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,320
and how you move that, you create that image

1193
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,880
and you move things around and like just-

1194
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,480
Picking new modules you want built in

1195
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,920
or just available on the side.

1196
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,400
Even understanding what the difference

1197
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,040
between having it built in and having it as a module

1198
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,320
was like a huge thing for me.

1199
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,800
Like, oh right, that's okay.

1200
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,080
I mean, I knew about kernel modules,

1201
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,720
but you really got your,

1202
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,960
you know, the great thing is you still could do that.

1203
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,960
You still could, you know.

1204
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,840
So I say, you know, what we ought to do.

1205
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,200
Well, here, let's go forward.

1206
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Oh, good, indoor plumbing once again.

1207
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
Wow, we really went back.

1208
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,200
I got to say though, I mean, it's not like you,

1209
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,200
we don't sit down and get to work and we never go,

1210
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
geez, I sure wish Wes knew how to use Linux better.

1211
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,200
I don't think that's ever been a problem.

1212
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,200
So you've managed, you managed just fine.

1213
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,200
I suppose so.

1214
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,200
Yeah, you did fine.

1215
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,200
And there's, you know,

1216
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,200
I'm sure there'll be future challenges.

1217
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:32,440
On the show, we'll see what weird distros we can cook up.

1218
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,980
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1219
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,100
Get started with a free trial of teams or enterprise plan

1220
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,760
at bitwarden.com slash Linux,

1221
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,640
or try it for free as an individual user.

1222
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,520
You are talking to some Bitwarden users right here

1223
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520
on the show.

1224
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,700
I love it as an individual user,

1225
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,240
but then it really took it to the next level

1226
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,300
and we started using it as a business for JB.

1227
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,560
You can use it to share and sync your sensitive data.

1228
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,960
It's not just passwords.

1229
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,920
I have other information in there,

1230
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,940
including things like some of the different shipping endpoints

1231
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,680
for sending stuff to the hosts or authentication,

1232
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,800
two factor codes, phrases, like some,

1233
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,360
some of my software requires recovery phrases like element.

1234
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,880
I'll store that in there.

1235
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,300
It's just a nice spot to have all of that.

1236
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,600
And you have peace of mind knowing that Bitwarden

1237
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,780
is open source.

1238
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,760
It's already trusted by millions of individuals.

1239
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,460
There's teams out there using it.

1240
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:22,040
There is a large community that's also practicing

1241
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,720
self-hosting the Bitwarden stuff.

1242
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,580
So you always have that as an option.

1243
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,360
I've opted to go for Bitwarden Cloud.

1244
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,900
I don't know if it, I must've asked you,

1245
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,900
but I've forgotten.

1246
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,400
Wes, do you use a Bitwarden Cloud

1247
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,280
or are you using local hosting?

1248
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,340
You know, I've done both.

1249
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,760
Right now I'm using the cloud as well.

1250
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,740
I love that there's the self-hosted option,

1251
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,000
but I also like that, you know,

1252
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,080
I felt the price is super reasonable.

1253
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,480
So it's sort of like it's a way that I can fund development

1254
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,040
and I don't have, you know, just one less thing

1255
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,920
I have to personally host.

1256
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,520
But I know if I want to do, I have the option.

1257
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,720
Well, check this out.

1258
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,440
New feature landing right now.

1259
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,640
I think you're gonna love this.

1260
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,240
And I can't believe I never thought about this.

1261
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,680
They're now adding a username generator.

1262
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,280
Oh, that's clever.

1263
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,120
Right?

1264
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,680
I mean, they've already got that handy password generator,

1265
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,520
so why not?

1266
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,760
Take it to the next level.

1267
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,320
And I don't need the same username.

1268
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,120
I out of habit use like the same two usernames everywhere.

1269
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,480
But do you care, especially on like, you know,

1270
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,120
just the random accounts that you have to have?

1271
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,240
Like for like banking stuff or like health site login stuff

1272
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,880
for like the health plan for wash.

1273
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,840
Like why am I using my NICs that I use

1274
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,080
on like public places there?

1275
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,700
That's ridiculous.

1276
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,080
Because I don't want to have to think of a username

1277
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,920
all the time.

1278
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,160
It's like what we used to do with passwords.

1279
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,120
I never even thought about it.

1280
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,120
And like, you think about it now,

1281
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,600
like isn't that way better,

1282
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,680
say if some service does get compromised

1283
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,680
and their username and password database leaks,

1284
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,760
if you're using a random password

1285
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,640
and a random username stored in Bitwarden for that,

1286
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,580
like you're fine.

1287
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,420
Yeah, that seems.

1288
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,280
It's a total non-issue.

1289
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,240
Even you decide, I love that they're adding that.

1290
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,660
And if you, this is also really cool.

1291
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,140
The generator offers an option

1292
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,840
for creating a random plus email address

1293
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,020
if your service supports that.

1294
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,900
So like Gmail, you know, like username plus

1295
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,760
your actual email at gmail.com.

1296
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,600
That's super handy.

1297
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,220
Yeah, they'll fill that in for the, what?

1298
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,320
I know they must have some logic in there that figures out.

1299
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,640
It's so great.

1300
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,280
They're adding stuff all the time too.

1301
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,120
And it's nice just knowing that you have

1302
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:12,800
that kind of security hygiene.

1303
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,560
So go try it out and support the show.

1304
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,540
It's easy to get started by going to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1305
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,100
Use it for yourself, use it for your business,

1306
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,680
or maybe the open source project you're working with.

1307
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,280
So go try it out and support the show.

1308
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,920
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

1309
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,520
Many of you wrote in this week with feedback.

1310
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,960
Thank you very much.

1311
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,760
We got a few on the topic of the generic

1312
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,520
ARM Linux images that we had, I say talk about,

1313
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,320
but it was a micro rant I think that Chris

1314
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,040
might have slipped into.

1315
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,380
Michael wrote in and suggests,

1316
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,800
the problem is that there's no such thing

1317
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,800
as a generic ARM system, at least in the same sense as x86.

1318
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,380
Every ARM device has its own bootloader system,

1319
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,720
device tree, and proprietary drivers and blobs.

1320
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,320
As an example of how crazy and nonstandard things are in ARM,

1321
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,620
the Raspberry Pi actually uses the GPU

1322
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,480
to run the bootloader.

1323
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,360
This is why all you can find are images for the Pi

1324
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,320
or for individual SOCs like the Pine 64.

1325
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,200
Among ARM devices, there's no such thing

1326
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,600
as standardized UEFI boot systems, for example,

1327
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,000
and no standard way to boot from a USB stick.

1328
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,240
In my mind, these are the reasons ARM

1329
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,560
has really not made much progress in the desktop

1330
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,840
and laptop computer space outside of Apple.

1331
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,720
I want to love ARM and I want it to succeed

1332
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,240
and be everywhere, I really do,

1333
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,560
but not until some basic standardization occurs

1334
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,520
and we can get generic Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, et cetera,

1335
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:46,440
for ARM that can boot on all laptops and desktops.

1336
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,560
This is a grade A email, grade A.

1337
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,740
Michael nails the problem, but Michael overlooks one thing.

1338
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:57,280
There is a standard generic ARM system

1339
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,880
and it's virtualized ARM and it's becoming super common

1340
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,200
because more and more ARM boards are capable

1341
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,920
of virtualization and additionally,

1342
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,920
every MacBook M1 or iMac M1 user out there

1343
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:14,000
now has access to creating generic ARM machines

1344
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,960
and it is super common to virtualize Linux

1345
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,200
on the Mac OS desktop for all kinds

1346
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,200
of development reasons and other reasons.

1347
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,240
And when these projects only release Raspberry Pi images

1348
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,680
like our friends at Ubuntu MATE

1349
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,340
or our friends at Home Assistant,

1350
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,240
then these new M1 virtualization platforms,

1351
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,880
which are fantastic virtualization machines,

1352
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,320
for example, Parallels 17 on Mac OS on the M1

1353
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,640
supports vert GPU pass-through.

1354
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,920
So you get a full OpenGL accelerated

1355
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,360
virtualization experience.

1356
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,120
So it's using that vert IO pass-through driver

1357
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,680
with Parallels 17 to talk to Metal.

1358
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,080
So the actual Linux desktop is rendered

1359
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,560
on the Mac client side using the local Metal API,

1360
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,800
but on the back side is passing through

1361
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,360
the virtual card GPU acceleration stuff.

1362
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,720
It's a great experience.

1363
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,280
And the fact that we're not releasing ARM images

1364
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,160
for general ARM virtualization means that

1365
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,240
a bunch of like CI test flows are not possible

1366
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,760
and everyone who's on one of these M1 chips

1367
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,680
can't virtualize that project.

1368
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,320
And I would love to just see projects just target that,

1369
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,560
like OpenSUSE has one of these, Fedora has one of these.

1370
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,920
You can, there are projects out there

1371
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,440
that just release these generic ARM ISOs

1372
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,920
and they're not image files.

1373
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,280
We're not flashing to an SD card like a child's toy, right?

1374
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,640
They're ISO files and we're installing them

1375
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,600
like a desktop operating system.

1376
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,880
And it makes a difference that it is a micro RAM,

1377
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,920
but it matters.

1378
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,000
And the ARM platform is becoming more and more prevalent

1379
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,160
now thanks to in part Chrome OS and Apple.

1380
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,520
But ultimately what Michael is touching on here

1381
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,320
where there's like all these different

1382
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,640
ARM boards and systems,

1383
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,400
and you require all these special kernel drivers and stuff.

1384
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,360
It is a mess.

1385
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,200
Yeah, right.

1386
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,760
And now, so suddenly now this more generic

1387
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,360
virtualized one is just one more.

1388
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,440
Yeah, it totally is.

1389
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,320
And this is why we have followed RISC-V with interest

1390
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,560
because it would be so nice to solve this problem.

1391
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,200
ARM is not the hero we have been looking for,

1392
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,680
but it may be the hero we end up getting stuck with

1393
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,160
because of just the industry support around it.

1394
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,680
Because you got to understand like that scale

1395
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,200
of manufacturing means that there is just

1396
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,880
a ton of ARM boards out there,

1397
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,640
a ton of ARM code out there.

1398
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,320
It's kind of like got momentum as they say.

1399
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,360
And now it is time for the boost.

1400
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,080
Marcel boosted in with a thousand sats

1401
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,360
with a great question.

1402
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,160
If Firefox is open source,

1403
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,200
how can Mozilla oblige anyone to distribute it

1404
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,680
in a particular way?

1405
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,840
It's a great question.

1406
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,360
Probably something we should have talked about.

1407
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,680
So last episode, it came up that Firefox is a snap

1408
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,200
and it is something that was worked out

1409
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,240
between Mozilla and Canonical at Mozilla's request.

1410
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,160
And people were just kind of discovering this as a thing

1411
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,920
as they upgraded to the new LTS,

1412
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,680
even though it's been a thing for a minute.

1413
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,480
Does anybody here know why that is the case?

1414
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,400
I have a guess, I don't know for sure,

1415
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,280
but I have a pretty strong guess.

1416
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,160
Something about redistributing trademarks, et cetera?

1417
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,920
Copyright and trademark, right?

1418
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,400
And if Canonical wants to put the Firefox name on there

1419
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,520
and the Firefox logo, which they would

1420
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,680
because they wanna look like a legitimate desktop,

1421
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,040
then they need to follow the wishes

1422
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,000
of the trademark and copyright owner.

1423
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,720
And this is just how sometimes US law is enforced

1424
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,400
to maintain the rights of free software for better or worse.

1425
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,160
Sometimes we use it to our advantage, right?

1426
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,480
The GPL is copyleft.

1427
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,880
It's Richard Stallman's troll of copyright law, basically.

1428
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,280
He's using copyright law to protect free software.

1429
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,720
It's actually very brilliant.

1430
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,080
But the other side is you can also use it to dictate terms.

1431
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,240
That's why some distros ship things like Iceweasel

1432
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,760
and stuff like that.

1433
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,440
Neville, you boosts in with a hundred sets.

1434
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,560
Imagine if Valve chose to use NixOS

1435
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,400
for the Steam Deck instead of Arch.

1436
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,520
I'm curious about the rabbit hole of discussion

1437
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,880
we could truly go down when pondering this question.

1438
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,080
Will Valve gain some benefits

1439
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,840
from using NixOS instead of Arch?

1440
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,200
Or is Arch a better option

1441
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,680
just due to how familiar the community is with it?

1442
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,200
This is a great question.

1443
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,560
Nev, that is, I wonder, right?

1444
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,760
Part of you wonders, did they just not know?

1445
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,680
Is there just not enough people out there

1446
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,720
talking about how they use Nix?

1447
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,720
But I think ultimately from Valve,

1448
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,560
tell me what you think, Wes,

1449
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,280
but I think it all came from we want upstream drivers

1450
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,160
and code as fast as possible.

1451
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,040
And when you ask that question to the Linux community,

1452
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,640
the answer's Arch, right?

1453
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,040
Yeah, and I mean, I guess it kind of depends

1454
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:41,960
on what they're comfortable with,

1455
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,680
what their engineers want to work with.

1456
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,840
And then, I mean, I could see,

1457
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,400
obviously there's a lot of benefits to NixOS,

1458
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,320
especially for the system aspect,

1459
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,040
but once you get to the Steam piece, less so, right?

1460
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,160
Like that's all gonna be outside of the build system

1461
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,000
and any of that anyway.

1462
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,040
You could, they could totally have a repo.

1463
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,840
I mean, like they could totally make it work with Nix,

1464
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,680
but you're right.

1465
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,240
Like once you get to the Steam client,

1466
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,520
the desktop stuff, Proton.

1467
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,840
And maybe, I mean, you know,

1468
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,680
I'm not saying that if you did go full Nix

1469
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,960
with that stuff that there wouldn't be benefits.

1470
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,800
I'm sure there would be,

1471
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,520
but just is that a realistic goal to add on

1472
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,000
or would it be sort of a hodgepodge?

1473
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,280
And then if they're not doing that much

1474
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,440
with the base system to start with,

1475
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,480
maybe there's not, that wasn't the biggest concern.

1476
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,960
Well, and here's a wild idea.

1477
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,160
What about developers, right?

1478
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,560
You want a system that is approachable by developers.

1479
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,080
And I think we all remember

1480
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,920
that during the Steam Deck developer period,

1481
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,320
Valve said, well, if you can't get your hands

1482
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,800
on a Steam Deck, here is a machine that specs similar,

1483
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,760
just install Manjaro.

1484
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,600
Like that's not as easy with NixOS.

1485
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,080
There's no Manjaro for NixOS.

1486
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,200
And that might play a role as well

1487
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,520
as the developer story here.

1488
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,120
But it would have meant that Valve didn't have

1489
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,120
to concoct their whole imaging read-only file system

1490
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,240
solution that they've kind of bolted on top of Arch, right?

1491
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,840
That whole, all of that would you just get

1492
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,640
that kind of reliability with Nix.

1493
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,280
It does maybe, and I suppose perhaps the Flatpak setup

1494
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,440
could work in a similar way.

1495
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,800
It does maybe make it a little more friendly for tinkering.

1496
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,160
Our next boost came in from exception or something like that.

1497
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,880
That's a pretty clever username.

1498
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,360
Just my two cents about real-time patches for Linux,

1499
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,840
because we talked about Ubuntu 22.04, including

1500
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:19,440
real-time patches of Linux with their Ubuntu Advantage service.

1501
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,680
But exception writes, it turns out

1502
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,520
that Linux is not really a real-time OS.

1503
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,880
We can make the OS OK for real-time operations

1504
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,320
with the ability of certain latency deadlines

1505
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,000
with these real-time patches.

1506
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,680
You see, I'm from a generation where

1507
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,240
we were told that an OS must be designed from the ground up

1508
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:38,960
for real-time.

1509
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,560
I remember that thinking too, actually.

1510
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,440
In fact, I until recently thought

1511
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,840
that was how it still was.

1512
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,200
But exception goes on to say, but we built Linux

1513
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,880
so that it was flexible, so that it could be adapted like no OS

1514
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,080
before it for all sorts of purposes,

1515
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,840
embedded Android server, and we found a way

1516
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,280
to make it work with Linux.

1517
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,720
Truly open source is the way.

1518
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,320
That's great.

1519
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,960
That's a great point, that now because of Linux's open nature,

1520
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,400
a company could come along and create these real-time patches

1521
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,440
who was just recently acquired by Intel

1522
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,640
and essentially create these latency deadlines.

1523
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,280
Wes, you had a really good explanation recently

1524
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,120
of how Linux is real-time or isn't real-time.

1525
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,400
Do you recall what it was?

1526
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,920
Well, I mean, I think there is still some points here

1527
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,960
that you might not use it for all tasks, right?

1528
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,320
But it is adding this ability to the kernel

1529
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,960
to approach stuff with more deterministic deadlines

1530
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,280
so that you do have a little more guarantees

1531
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,440
that the tasks that you need to have happen

1532
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,640
can happen within a set boundary.

1533
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,360
And that is kind of the key of it, right?

1534
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,680
Is that this task will execute

1535
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,360
within this guaranteed window of time.

1536
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,000
Yeah, because on a non-real-time system,

1537
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,920
you might have some unpredictable latency

1538
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,320
that even if it only happens a tiny percentage of the time,

1539
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,080
it could mean that your safety check

1540
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,640
for some industrial machine

1541
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:55,320
didn't happen within those tight timeframes.

1542
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,280
And so you can, with a real-time kernel,

1543
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,880
you're often trading some kind of overall throughput

1544
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,200
for the system to keep things within that boundary

1545
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,200
so you know the system will predictably keep ticking on.

1546
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,920
And this conversation really came up on this show

1547
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,240
when we had Tim on from JPL and he was talking about

1548
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,680
how the Linux Copter is a real-time kernel

1549
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,640
because of these reasons that you just outlined.

1550
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,920
And so Exception wanted to write in

1551
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,040
and just kind of point out that like,

1552
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,320
when we talk about real-time,

1553
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,200
that's actually what we're talking about.

1554
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,040
That's how it works.

1555
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,960
It's sort of these guarantees

1556
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,360
that within a certain window of latency of time,

1557
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,680
this task will execute.

1558
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,080
And when you're in an industrial application,

1559
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,360
that's absolutely necessary.

1560
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:31,840
And it's neat because like, I think there, you know,

1561
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,680
there's still our specific real-time operating systems

1562
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,000
for stuff where that's really important

1563
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,400
or you need to build on that base.

1564
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,640
This just opens up, you know, for maybe the, you know,

1565
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,080
the top tier of those things.

1566
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,800
Well, that's a category Linux can play in now.

1567
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,480
We got a double boost from Nev this week.

1568
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,400
Nev wrote in, I would like to interject for a moment

1569
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,720
and comment that this podcast does not contain

1570
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,640
any mention of Gen2 nor Emacs.

1571
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,640
Ah, we fixed that this week at least.

1572
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,320
As such, I publicly challenge the next person

1573
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:02,360
who sends stats to JB to install Gen2 Linux

1574
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,400
and daily drive it for one week.

1575
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,120
If they can prove, I will directly send them 5,000 stats

1576
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,080
with JB getting an additional 5,000 stats

1577
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,000
and giving them the right to declare

1578
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,440
the next boost challenge.

1579
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,520
A boost challenge.

1580
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,720
Boost challenge, wow.

1581
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,480
Boost challenge declared by Nev.

1582
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:22,240
So, you gotta run Gen2 for a week.

1583
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,960
And I think to make this work, you probably have to have,

1584
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,880
it has to be a new install of Gen2.

1585
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,720
You can't like, cause you know, people.

1586
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,520
Yeah, if you're already using it, that doesn't count.

1587
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,040
You know, there's like five guys listening right now.

1588
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:31,880
They're like, crap.

1589
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,800
But, you gotta have a new install.

1590
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,800
And if you can prove it, I don't know,

1591
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,920
will you take a picture of your computer

1592
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,760
with the newspaper?

1593
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,400
I don't know how you prove it.

1594
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,400
You come up with something.

1595
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,520
You start it with a screenshot with the New York Times up

1596
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,520
and you end it with a screenshot with the New York Times up.

1597
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,760
I don't know, I don't know.

1598
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,880
It's, you know, it's like a,

1599
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,560
you got your terminal going with a.

1600
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,400
Yeah, like something.

1601
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,720
OS release, and then you got like

1602
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,960
the front page of Hacker News.

1603
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,480
Yeah, okay.

1604
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,160
You do it for a week.

1605
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,640
You send, and you send us some boosts proving it

1606
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,920
and then Neve will send you 5,000 SATs

1607
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,080
and send us 5,000 SATs

1608
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:06,640
and then we get to declare a boost challenge.

1609
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,480
Which that's what I'm looking forward to.

1610
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,320
I got all kinds of ideas.

1611
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,520
I like, I like, it's a weird mix

1612
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:12,480
of like an NPR style fundraiser,

1613
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:15,600
but also like the ice bucket challenge from years back.

1614
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,680
So I don't know what's going on, but I support it.

1615
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,160
Boost to Graham.

1616
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,960
Also just want to mention

1617
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,200
that you can essentially send me a PM via boost

1618
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,240
like a NorCal Linux dad did.

1619
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,080
He sent me just a little FYI

1620
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,120
so I know about something going on with an upcoming event.

1621
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,440
And he knew it would be right in front of my face.

1622
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,680
And as I start rethinking how I want to have myself available

1623
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,560
I think it's going to be the contact form

1624
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,080
and boosts are going to be like the top two ways

1625
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,480
to get messages in.

1626
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,720
So you can send a direct message to me

1627
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:45,360
who has a boost as well.

1628
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,600
And you can actually use,

1629
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,520
there's these URLs you can use now.

1630
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,360
It's pretty cool.

1631
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,200
We're going to go into,

1632
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,320
there's all kinds of stuff going on in podcasting

1633
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,040
including some new standards that are rolling out.

1634
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,560
Ooh, a new cool backend technology that's happening.

1635
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,280
Also a super awesome way to,

1636
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,320
something I want to talk about after the show,

1637
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,040
a super awesome way to generate RSS feeds.

1638
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,880
All of that.

1639
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,480
So we're covering some of those podcasting developments

1640
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,080
in office hours now to kind of keep it out of this show.

1641
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,040
So we can stay focused on the Linux here.

1642
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:11,960
There's enough going on.

1643
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,760
But it is such an interesting time.

1644
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,240
There is some really awesome new stuff being developed.

1645
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,920
And when you hear it, you're like, wow,

1646
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,000
how have we not had this stuff in podcasting before?

1647
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,960
Like podcasting just sort of sat around for a decade

1648
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,760
and really did nothing new.

1649
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,320
But podcasting 2.0 has a lot of really cool new features.

1650
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,960
And I've been playing around with systems

1651
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,320
to help us generate transcripts.

1652
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,160
Cause that's one of them.

1653
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,160
Oh yeah.

1654
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,320
Yeah. See, I can just get going forever.

1655
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,240
Anyways, we'll put it in office hours from time to time.

1656
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,840
So go check that out at officehours.hair.

1657
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,000
But if you want more of this show,

1658
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,680
you can become a member either with the whole network

1659
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,480
and all of the shows and all of their bonus features

1660
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,960
at jupyter.party,

1661
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,680
or you can become an unplugged core contributor

1662
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,520
at unpluggedcore.com and sign up as a member.

1663
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,040
And you get access to two different options,

1664
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,320
two different perks,

1665
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,320
but by far by like a huge margin,

1666
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,560
like by 90%, the preference is the live stream.

1667
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,200
I could basically stop even mentioning

1668
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,280
that we have a ad free version.

1669
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,160
People do not care.

1670
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,280
They want the live stream version.

1671
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,920
That's the one everybody wants.

1672
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,760
And that's, you know,

1673
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,240
we try to make a lot of extra content

1674
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,280
in the pre and post show.

1675
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,240
And you get to hear, like,

1676
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,960
if we stopped for a pee break and Wes and Brent just,

1677
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,160
you know, chew up the, you know, the chat.

1678
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,320
So that's unpluggedcore.com

1679
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,280
or you can support the entire network at jupyter.party.

1680
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,920
The whole thing is if you get a little value

1681
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,600
from the show from time to time or frequently,

1682
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:31,920
that's another way you can contribute back.

1683
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,840
But another way is to join us live.

1684
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:37,200
We do the show on Sundays at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1685
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,080
Send us an email.

1686
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,920
That's also a great way to contribute some value

1687
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,120
is give us some feedback,

1688
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,760
maybe give us an idea, make a contact,

1689
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,520
or we really appreciate it

1690
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,200
when you spread the word about the show.

1691
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,280
That's a great way to really contribute some value back

1692
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,600
because who wants to listen to a podcast just cold?

1693
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,560
The podcasts you want to listen to

1694
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,760
are the ones you get told about.

1695
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,320
Yeah, you know, put it on a speaker

1696
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,440
outside your house all day.

1697
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,400
Maybe you get driving someone in the car

1698
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,480
for an unrelated reason.

1699
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,040
Throw Linux Unplugged on.

1700
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,360
See you next week.

1701
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,880
Same bad time, same bad station.

1702
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,000
Oh yeah, of course.

1703
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,840
Of course, we should mention, too,

1704
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,640
the companion show, linuxactionnews.com.

1705
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,000
Lots going on every single week.

1706
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,640
Wes and I break it down to linuxactionnews.com.

1707
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,560
Links to what we talked about today in this here show

1708
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:22,240
at linuxunplugged.com, slash 456.

1709
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,080
You know, we should mention,

1710
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,400
Linux Action News is gonna be out

1711
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,720
a little bit late this week.

1712
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,560
You're right.

1713
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,400
Just a little bit, so.

1714
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,680
Little bit of a delay.

1715
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,520
Just wait.

1716
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,360
Yeah, just subscribe.

1717
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,360
There's always the all shows feed.

1718
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:33,200
You just get everything.

1719
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,960
Like Office Hours, like Linux Action News, and this show.

1720
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,080
Anyways, that wraps it up for us.

1721
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:37,920
Thanks so much for joining us

1722
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,360
on this week's episode of The Unplugged Program.

1723
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,840
See you right back here next week.

1724
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:53,840
This week's episode of The Unplugged Program is brought to you

1725
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:15,840
by Tiny.

1726
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,280
Tiny made a good point in the mumble room, too.

1727
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:22,400
Another perk for Valve going with, say, Arch over Nix

1728
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,320
is the community has just built a lot of tooling already.

1729
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,000
There's a lot there for them to just leverage immediately.

1730
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:28,840
That's a solid point.

1731
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,560
And of course, Valve would want to take advantage of that.

1732
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:34,840
Although, I suppose, as Kukuf mentioned in the IRC.

1733
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,680
What was that?

1734
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,520
I'm sorry?

1735
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,360
You heard me.

1736
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,560
That, I mean, Nix would probably be pretty great

1737
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,160
at generating that read-only image.

1738
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,400
That's what, that was my point.

1739
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,920
It's like a lot of the work they did

1740
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,360
to make Arch consumable by consumers,

1741
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,160
they would have just inherited with Nix.

1742
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,480
And then they could just set up a few repos

1743
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,840
and add a couple of lines to the config and good to go.

1744
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,240
And they basically have their own custom OS.

1745
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,000
That's what's so slick about it.

1746
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,120
We got some other really good feedback on the ARM stuff.

1747
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,440
We just didn't have a chance to fit it in the main show.

1748
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:07,240
But Paul wrote in, I think it was Paul, right?

1749
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,920
We hit a nerve in the arm, I could say.

1750
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:10,800
You're right.

1751
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,960
You could say that.

1752
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,960
He writes, when ARM-based platforms became

1753
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,840
a thing in the Linux world, nothing

1754
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,680
told the OS what processor it ran on

1755
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,240
or which peripherals were connected.

1756
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,840
And he goes on to talk about how it was just such a mess

1757
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,720
early on.

1758
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,880
And it got old.

1759
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,600
And we needed device reconfigurations.

1760
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,240
We had to create that.

1761
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,880
There had to be all of this work.

1762
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,720
And he says, now, these days, we've sort of figured it out.

1763
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,920
And we don't need separate kernels.

1764
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,000
But back then, one of the ways they were doing this

1765
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,400
was different kernels for different ARM devices.

1766
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,280
And we forget it wasn't really that long ago.

1767
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,560
It is getting a lot better now.

1768
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,640
And we are seeing a lot more support for at least

1769
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,600
the Raspberry Pi side.

1770
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,200
Paul makes a good point there.

1771
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,160
And we've seen all the trouble in Project Treble

1772
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:54,680
over in the Android world.

1773
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,080
And he says it's still not great.

1774
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,960
He's like, you know, you look at it today,

1775
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,000
it's still pretty difficult to support the different boards

1776
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:00,880
with the same kernel.

1777
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,680
Because often, there are patches that

1778
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,680
can kind of conflict with each other to enable.

1779
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:05,480
Yeah.

1780
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,200
You can see that, too, if they have custom video cards or USB

1781
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,640
buses or network adapters.

1782
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,920
I feel like it's especially painful because we're always

1783
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,800
following up on what's coming out in the latest kernel.

1784
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,120
And then on those devices, you're

1785
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,640
stuck with probably a LTS kernel or something

1786
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,000
that they've chosen to, hopefully,

1787
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,380
that they've chosen to build for you.

1788
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:20,880
Yeah.

1789
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,280
This is why, ultimately, you just

1790
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,640
hear us talk more about the Pi on here.

1791
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,400
Because that all works now.

1792
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,760
That's all upstream in the kernel.

1793
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,060
It all works now in the kernel.

1794
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,560
And that's a big deal.

1795
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,000
When I say ecosystem, that's kind

1796
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,120
of what I'm talking about.

1797
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:52,400
It's going to be PIs and Mac Minis.
