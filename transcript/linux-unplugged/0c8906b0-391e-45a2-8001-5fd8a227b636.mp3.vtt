WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.880
Ready when Brent is.

00:00.880 --> 00:02.440
How you doing over there, Brent?

00:02.440 --> 00:03.720
Tracking down a power cord?

00:03.720 --> 00:04.520
What are you doing?

00:04.520 --> 00:07.040
Yeah, it's actually a desk vibration issue.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.120
I think I've figured it out.

00:08.120 --> 00:09.040
What do you think?

00:09.040 --> 00:10.840
I think it does sound better.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.800
I don't know how you have desk vibration issues.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.320
Amazing.

00:18.320 --> 00:19.820
You know, I don't mean these things,

00:19.820 --> 00:21.200
but sometimes they just happen.

00:21.200 --> 00:33.360
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.160
My name is Chris.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.200
My name is Wes.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.080
My name is Brent.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.680
And my name is Alex.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.120
Hello, gentlemen.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.240
Thank you all for joining me here in our giant Linux

00:41.240 --> 00:42.240
assembly.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.840
As we have quite the show this week,

00:43.840 --> 00:45.920
we're looking at two new options that

00:45.920 --> 00:48.640
enable anyone to run a personal server at home.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.520
I'm talking easily, safely, self-host this sucker yourself,

00:52.520 --> 00:54.760
and run some of your favorite open-source apps

00:54.760 --> 00:58.640
like Nextcloud, maybe a matrix server, anything you want.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.280
Take control of your data after today's episode.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.200
And then we're going to round it out

01:03.200 --> 01:06.280
with some great emails, boosts, picks, and more.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.300
We have quite the show.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.540
Very excited about it today.

01:08.540 --> 01:10.760
So before we go any further, let's

01:10.760 --> 01:13.760
say time-appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.000
Hello, Mumble Room.

01:15.000 --> 01:15.500
Hello.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.000
Hello.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Hello, Chris.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.840
Wes, Brent, and everyone.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.600
And also, Alex, thanks for joining us.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.400
It's been a bit since we had you on the show.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.920
But today's episode kind of seemed

01:24.920 --> 01:26.280
like it was in your sweet spot.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.960
I like what you've done with the drapes.

01:27.960 --> 01:28.560
Yeah.

01:28.560 --> 01:29.720
That was Wes's idea.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.040
You know, I didn't think unicorns

01:31.040 --> 01:31.960
would match the decor.

01:31.960 --> 01:35.240
But if you get the right unicorns, it works.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.080
I think the googly eyes go a long way.

01:37.080 --> 01:37.960
Yes.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.880
It's just they all look like they're looking at me.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.640
Well, one of the other reasons Alex is here

01:42.640 --> 01:45.320
besides the topic, which is right down his alley,

01:45.320 --> 01:48.840
because he is our host of Self-Hosted,

01:48.840 --> 01:52.520
is we are also announcing, very excited about this,

01:52.520 --> 01:56.600
a Jupiter broadcasting East Coast meetup.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.200
It has been a long time coming.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.040
We have not made it out to the East Coast

02:01.040 --> 02:04.760
since Ohio Linux Fest about 100 years ago.

02:04.760 --> 02:07.560
So on April 9, a Saturday, we're going

02:07.560 --> 02:10.980
to be in Raleigh, North Carolina.

02:10.980 --> 02:14.840
And Alex, I think you have maybe found the ultimate meetup

02:14.840 --> 02:15.720
location.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.200
I think this could be one of our best spots ever.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.080
I hope so, yeah.

02:19.080 --> 02:22.740
So I've been racking my brains for a COVID-safe location,

02:22.740 --> 02:25.120
which primarily means somewhere outside.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.460
And you want somewhere with good food and good drink.

02:28.460 --> 02:31.360
So we're going to go to a place called Prime Barbecue, which

02:31.360 --> 02:34.600
is a Texas-style barbecue joint.

02:34.600 --> 02:38.560
And then just across the park from this place,

02:38.560 --> 02:42.200
it's a place called Oak City Brewing, a local brewery.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.080
That's so great.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.240
You got a park with barbecue on one side

02:46.240 --> 02:47.640
and a brewery on the other side.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.040
I'm salivating already.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.800
North Carolina, Raleigh, North Carolina

02:50.800 --> 02:54.320
is going to be beautiful in early April, right?

02:54.320 --> 02:55.960
Like, Wes, you got to go.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.360
I mean, you just got to go, Wes.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.240
We're going to talk Brent into it, too.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.840
I think I have to go.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.400
I'm in.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.560
I love it.

03:03.560 --> 03:04.800
All right, cool.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.360
So I have a link to the meetup in the show notes,

03:07.360 --> 03:09.760
or you can find it by going to meetup.com slash Jupiter

03:09.760 --> 03:10.960
broadcasting.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.280
We don't make it out to the East Coast very often.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.640
I'm hoping to bring the wife and maybe the boy with me,

03:16.640 --> 03:18.640
because it's going to be right around his birthday

03:18.640 --> 03:20.360
and spring break.

03:20.360 --> 03:21.360
So I'm not sure exactly.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.920
But I think we're flying.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.520
As much as it would feed my soul to take Joups out there

03:26.520 --> 03:28.680
on a road trip, because I've always wanted a road trip

03:28.680 --> 03:32.120
to see Alex, I just don't think we could get the cost figured

03:32.120 --> 03:34.720
out, because it's going to be four or five grand in gas

03:34.720 --> 03:37.480
alone, plus wear and tear on the vehicle, plus camping.

03:37.480 --> 03:40.360
So then it's looking like a seven grand trip to take Joups,

03:40.360 --> 03:45.040
versus a two or three grand trip if we fly.

03:45.040 --> 03:49.060
And even that's kind of expensive, so it is what it is.

03:49.060 --> 03:50.520
I'd love to do the whole thing, where

03:50.520 --> 03:52.520
we do the trip and shows on the whole road.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.280
But I think for this one, we're just

03:54.280 --> 03:56.360
going to do the surgical strike, because it's

03:56.360 --> 03:57.360
the most economical.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.240
Look at you being practical.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.900
I mean, it would make me a little worried,

04:00.900 --> 04:03.280
considering how you got stuck in Tucson last time.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.820
There's a lot of places to get stuck across the whole country.

04:05.820 --> 04:06.320
It's true.

04:06.320 --> 04:09.460
However, much better time of the year

04:09.460 --> 04:13.520
to travel, especially once you make it down south.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.720
April is not nearly as hot as August.

04:16.720 --> 04:17.920
That was brutal.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.040
But I'm very excited either way.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.560
It's really long overdue.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.940
Couple of small details.

04:22.940 --> 04:27.100
We're thinking of meeting around about 3 PM, so mid-afternoon.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.540
The barbecue place closes about 5,

04:29.540 --> 04:32.320
and then we'll head on over to the brewery afterwards.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.280
Those are good details.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.180
Thanks for adding that.

04:34.180 --> 04:36.480
There was something else, but I've forgotten what it is.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.960
Well, the meetup page is super early.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.000
It's just really rough.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.300
But I could add you as a organizer, Alex,

04:43.300 --> 04:44.800
and then you could add the details

04:44.800 --> 04:45.960
as you think of them and stuff.

04:45.960 --> 04:46.820
Yeah, that sounds good.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.520
We'll probably want to do some updates and stuff.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.640
Let's do that, yeah.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.120
Do you think Jose might show up?

04:51.120 --> 04:54.000
Oh, that's always going to be the question now, isn't it?

04:54.000 --> 04:54.960
All right, Jose.

04:54.960 --> 04:55.920
Gauntlet's been thrown.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.680
We shall see.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.440
OK, well, Alex, while you're here,

05:00.440 --> 05:02.680
I wanted to pick up on something that you and I touched

05:02.680 --> 05:05.440
on in Self-Hosted 65 last week.

05:05.440 --> 05:08.400
And that is the release of True Naz Scale.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.840
This is a big release, because iXsystems

05:10.840 --> 05:14.200
has been working on this since the summer of 2020.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.960
And this, unlike previous Free Naz and True Naz products,

05:18.960 --> 05:20.320
this one's based on Debian.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.920
It's based on Debian 11, which enabled

05:22.920 --> 05:25.480
them to do a whole bunch of extra stuff,

05:25.480 --> 05:30.360
like properly support Docker, use KVM for the back end

05:30.360 --> 05:32.060
virtualization.

05:32.060 --> 05:35.560
And to manage all of it underneath the GUI,

05:35.560 --> 05:38.040
to manage those containers and those VMs,

05:38.040 --> 05:42.240
they're using HelmScript, which is, what's an easy way to say

05:42.240 --> 05:44.080
that, say, composable Kubernetes?

05:44.080 --> 05:45.480
How would you describe HelmScript?

05:45.480 --> 05:48.400
Yeah, Helm is like compose for Kubernetes.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.440
That's what I would say.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.480
And so you could see how, if you have

05:51.480 --> 05:53.640
a whole system that's being orchestrated by Kubernetes,

05:53.640 --> 05:57.640
it does kind of lend itself to scaling out, hence the name.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.360
But you went hands-on with it, Alex,

05:59.360 --> 06:01.920
and you go into detail in Self-Hosted.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.160
But I just kind of wanted to get your impressions

06:04.160 --> 06:06.080
as a potential platform for people

06:06.080 --> 06:10.040
to use this to run applications at home like Next Cloud,

06:10.040 --> 06:12.520
maybe to back up their systems, like their desktops

06:12.520 --> 06:14.640
and their laptops and other servers they might have.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.080
What are your opinions for that kind of use case?

06:17.080 --> 06:19.520
Well, we talked about it in episode 65, as you say,

06:19.520 --> 06:20.560
of Self-Hosted.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.440
And my impressions, unfortunately,

06:22.440 --> 06:25.040
were kind of colored by the fact that I

06:25.040 --> 06:27.840
was unable to even do a basic thing like import

06:27.840 --> 06:30.240
my existing ZFS pool.

06:30.240 --> 06:33.800
And without storage, you can't really do very much in TrueNAS,

06:33.800 --> 06:34.720
as it turns out.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.520
So I'm going to have to revisit it in a few months

06:37.520 --> 06:39.280
and actually wait until they've worked out

06:39.280 --> 06:41.240
some of the release kinks.

06:41.240 --> 06:43.840
But since airing that episode on Friday,

06:43.840 --> 06:47.000
we've had a few folks write into the Self-Hosted mailbox

06:47.000 --> 06:48.600
telling me, because I was struggling

06:48.600 --> 06:50.160
to think of a use case for TrueNAS,

06:50.160 --> 06:54.120
really, in a world of un-raids and kind of just normal Linux

06:54.120 --> 06:56.680
with ZFS on Linux kind of layered on top.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.760
Turns out lots of people use it for things like dentists

06:59.760 --> 07:01.920
and doctor's offices, that kind of thing,

07:01.920 --> 07:05.800
small to medium business deployments, that sort of thing.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.640
So there is definitely a market out there

07:07.640 --> 07:09.680
for something like TrueNAS.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.560
Laurence Systems, Tom from Laurence Systems,

07:11.560 --> 07:13.500
has done some good content on it this week.

07:13.500 --> 07:17.320
I think the Craft Computing dude has done some stuff as well.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.600
And served the home as well.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.880
But I'm pretty excited about what this means, really,

07:20.880 --> 07:24.080
for the future of ZFS on Linux as a project,

07:24.080 --> 07:28.680
like having TrueNAS scale and, in particular,

07:28.680 --> 07:32.480
a Linux-based version of, air quotes, the product formerly

07:32.480 --> 07:35.120
known as FreeNAS, is really exciting.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.760
It's almost as exciting as the Steam Deck on the desktop.

07:37.760 --> 07:41.080
Like, it's a proper legitimization

07:41.080 --> 07:42.760
of that technology stack.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.160
I know Chris and I have chatted about this for a bit.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.920
But what does the switch of base system actually mean for you?

07:48.920 --> 07:50.960
As an admin, especially if maybe folks

07:50.960 --> 07:52.720
are used to just using the UI, what

07:52.720 --> 07:54.040
does the base platform matter?

07:54.040 --> 07:57.480
Well, it matters less than it did, thanks to containers.

07:57.480 --> 08:01.560
But every time I log into my OpenSense box,

08:01.560 --> 08:04.040
and I think, oh, it would be cool if I could just

08:04.040 --> 08:07.040
apt-get this package, or whatever it is.

08:07.040 --> 08:11.720
I'm totally fluent and familiar with all of the Linux tooling.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.400
But even just something as simple on BSD

08:14.400 --> 08:17.280
as doing a netstat, for example, to list all the listening

08:17.280 --> 08:20.360
ports for a particular service.

08:20.360 --> 08:24.400
The flags I use for netstat have to be different in BSD

08:24.400 --> 08:25.360
than they do to Linux.

08:25.360 --> 08:28.240
It's just, I guess, a muscle memory thing at this point.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.680
Like, I use Linux all day, every day.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.180
And I don't want to have to remember

08:32.180 --> 08:34.800
that for this particular box, I have to context switch

08:34.800 --> 08:37.520
to the BSD version of stuff.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.400
Right, you're simply back to ifconfig.

08:39.400 --> 08:43.120
It's death by 1,000 little paper cuts for me, BSD.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.800
And maybe those hurt a little bit extra

08:44.800 --> 08:46.600
when you're kind of in crisis mode.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.400
And that can happen when it's your NAS.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.120
Which is normally when you're looking at that kind of thing,

08:50.120 --> 08:52.440
yeah, exactly.

08:52.440 --> 08:53.520
Yeah.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.000
I'll tell you what I find interesting about it.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.600
And you just touched on it, Alex.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.720
So for TrueNAS Scale, and of course they still

08:58.720 --> 09:01.520
have the regular TrueNAS products that are BSD based,

09:01.520 --> 09:04.800
but with TrueNAS Scale, it's exactly that use case.

09:04.800 --> 09:08.680
What I did for the very last kind of two years of my IT

09:08.680 --> 09:11.440
contracting where I became an independent contractor,

09:11.440 --> 09:17.360
my ninja move was a Linux box that was pretty powerful

09:17.360 --> 09:18.800
that ran KVM.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.400
And then Microsoft, they probably still make it,

09:21.400 --> 09:23.080
but back then they made this tool

09:23.080 --> 09:25.920
that you could install on a Windows server

09:25.920 --> 09:31.000
and it would convert a live Windows server into a VHD file.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.160
And I could then move that to my Linux box.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.880
And so what I would do for these folks

09:34.880 --> 09:38.000
is I would help virtualize their legacy infrastructure

09:38.000 --> 09:39.720
from their failing hardware.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.120
I would use Samba on the host to actually provide

09:43.120 --> 09:45.480
a lot of the essential network services.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.560
Because often they were like older Windows boxes,

09:47.560 --> 09:50.320
NT4 or something like that.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.280
Or just another thing that was kind of common

09:52.280 --> 09:54.920
is people would just use Windows XP

09:54.920 --> 09:58.480
and just set up file sharing on it for like a doctor's office

09:58.480 --> 10:00.040
or a dentist's office.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.520
I actually, this exact scenario happened at a dentist's office.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.040
They use a Windows XP workstation

10:06.040 --> 10:08.680
because they needed access to a scanner as well.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.960
And I ultimately moved that all over to a Linux box

10:10.960 --> 10:12.920
and then we just kept the XP workstation just

10:12.920 --> 10:15.080
to do the scanning and save it to the Samba share.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.080
And what TrueNAS Scale has done here

10:18.080 --> 10:19.640
is they've really built this thing

10:19.640 --> 10:24.680
to be super user-friendly for Windows right out of the box.

10:24.680 --> 10:28.480
It supports all of the fancy kind of Windows Samba share

10:28.480 --> 10:31.600
features that you need to just kind of look totally

10:31.600 --> 10:34.920
like a Windows file server to the clients.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.160
And that to me is like, that's great

10:37.160 --> 10:39.160
because anytime I'm setting something up,

10:39.160 --> 10:41.320
that's definitely part of the setup.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.880
And to have IX systems just kind of build

10:43.880 --> 10:46.640
those kinds of things in in a prescribed way

10:46.640 --> 10:49.480
where it's already on and it's on in the right way

10:49.480 --> 10:51.200
because this is what they do.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.240
And they give me a UI that I could actually

10:53.240 --> 10:56.760
hand off to like the tech person, quote unquote,

10:56.760 --> 10:58.200
at that office.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.280
Or in the case of this dentist's office,

11:00.280 --> 11:01.840
he wanted to have the login.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.120
He wanted all the passwords.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.480
And this is something he could actually go check to see

11:06.480 --> 11:08.280
how much free space he has.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.040
And so this is exactly the kind of thing

11:10.040 --> 11:11.840
I would deploy for that dentist's office, no doubt

11:11.840 --> 11:12.680
about it.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.200
What they ended up getting from me

11:14.200 --> 11:16.760
were just Linux boxes that just would

11:16.760 --> 11:19.760
have some form of some whatever web admin

11:19.760 --> 11:22.120
UI was in style back then.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.480
Well, I'd be curious to know what

11:23.480 --> 11:24.920
has changed from then till now.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.640
It sounds to me like abstraction is

11:26.640 --> 11:30.080
the whole kind of beauty of where we've come now.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.680
It's like you just kind of hit a few buttons

11:31.680 --> 11:32.760
and it's all there for you.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.680
I would imagine, Chris, back then it was quite a bit of work

11:34.680 --> 11:35.520
to set all this up.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.320
But do you think now it would be like maybe, I don't know,

11:38.320 --> 11:39.400
a few minutes for you?

11:39.400 --> 11:41.960
The big advantage here now with their support of Docker

11:41.960 --> 11:43.580
containers is a lot of the applications

11:43.580 --> 11:47.720
you'd be deploying on a local network for a small office

11:47.720 --> 11:50.040
or any small business, a lot of that's

11:50.040 --> 11:52.860
going to be via a Docker container or a VM.

11:52.860 --> 11:55.480
And they make that really easy now because they support KVM

11:55.480 --> 11:57.800
and Docker.

11:57.800 --> 11:58.960
It's still early.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.080
Like Alex said, he ran into issues.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.760
If he was creating a new storage pool,

12:02.760 --> 12:04.200
it probably wouldn't have had any problems.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.620
But Alex, because you're trying to import your old storage

12:06.620 --> 12:08.760
pool, you ran into some kind of bug.

12:08.760 --> 12:13.480
I bet you if you checked back in six, seven months,

12:13.480 --> 12:15.080
downloaded the latest ISO, I bet you

12:15.080 --> 12:16.880
you wouldn't even have that problem anymore.

12:16.880 --> 12:17.840
They're just kind of early still,

12:17.840 --> 12:19.360
even though they've been working on this for a while.

12:19.360 --> 12:20.840
It may well do that.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.600
There were a couple of other teething issues

12:22.600 --> 12:25.160
which we covered in the episode as well.

12:25.160 --> 12:27.520
But I look at the other thing that they're doing there,

12:27.520 --> 12:31.800
including Gluster out of the box as their primary scaling

12:31.800 --> 12:32.800
storage method.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.760
Scaling out ZFS, yeah.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.420
Yeah, it's a really interesting play, that.

12:36.420 --> 12:39.560
Because then you end up treating individual servers

12:39.560 --> 12:43.280
like they become cattle instead of pets.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.840
And you can lose any of those servers

12:45.840 --> 12:48.240
and still maintain your data.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.200
So there's some really interesting stuff

12:50.200 --> 12:51.960
that they're bringing to the masses

12:51.960 --> 12:53.720
almost with this release.

12:53.720 --> 12:58.080
I have to say that Gluster aspect of it kind of for just

12:58.080 --> 13:01.700
a second made me go, maybe this is what we should be doing.

13:01.700 --> 13:04.740
Because we've kind of had a pause with our local server

13:04.740 --> 13:05.760
rollout.

13:05.760 --> 13:09.060
And what we've been thinking is maybe instead

13:09.060 --> 13:12.060
of YOLOing the storage like we were originally going to do

13:12.060 --> 13:12.800
and just like.

13:12.800 --> 13:13.960
Definitely, definitely.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.560
Just YOLO it for sure.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.600
Not enough VDEVs, crazy configurations

13:17.600 --> 13:18.840
with not enough redundancy.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.360
And then like, let's grab some fiber channel,

13:20.360 --> 13:21.740
connect these things together, and just run

13:21.740 --> 13:23.360
disks across all of these.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.960
Now I'm looking at it going, well,

13:24.960 --> 13:26.280
what if we did the opposite thing

13:26.280 --> 13:27.920
and we actually built for reliability?

13:27.920 --> 13:31.400
So like, what if we wanted to host more things here?

13:31.400 --> 13:33.680
And how would I build the infrastructure in that case?

13:33.680 --> 13:35.280
And there was a few minutes where

13:35.280 --> 13:37.640
I'm looking at that Freenet scale and I'm going,

13:37.640 --> 13:40.360
you know, this would solve some of our problems.

13:40.360 --> 13:43.040
Like, I could immediately see how it would work for us.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.880
You know you did that in self-hosted as well.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.240
You called it Freenet scale.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.200
And I let it go then.

13:47.200 --> 13:47.700
Oh, yeah.

13:47.700 --> 13:49.600
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.120
TrueNAS scale.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.080
I just thought that was funny.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.400
Yeah, you know, it's hard for me.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.020
Because it's been Freenet my whole life.

13:54.020 --> 13:56.320
You know, this TrueNAS stuff, that feels new, Alex.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.520
But if you're going to build a system like that at JB,

13:58.520 --> 14:01.600
let's say you've got two or three different systems.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.520
Are they all in the same building?

14:03.520 --> 14:05.280
Or is there an internet connection involved

14:05.280 --> 14:07.160
between them offsite?

14:07.160 --> 14:10.160
Well, in my new head paradigm, they're in the same building.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.660
In my old head paradigm, there was like one

14:12.660 --> 14:14.160
at Wes's house or something.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.780
So what would be wrong with something like just a simple ZFS

14:16.780 --> 14:18.000
receive and send?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.160
When I started looking at it through the lens of Freenet

14:20.160 --> 14:22.160
scale, I started thinking, what if this

14:22.160 --> 14:26.720
would let me manage KVM and Docker containers across all

14:26.720 --> 14:28.480
three of these systems?

14:28.480 --> 14:30.560
You know, what if it let me kind of just trade it all

14:30.560 --> 14:33.840
as one giant storage pool?

14:33.840 --> 14:36.320
Then I started thinking, OK, maybe we could actually

14:36.320 --> 14:38.120
start hosting quite a bit of applications

14:38.120 --> 14:39.360
if we started doing that.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.200
I don't know, I'm just kind of thinking,

14:41.200 --> 14:42.200
before where I was thinking I was just

14:42.200 --> 14:43.600
going to use a couple of the systems

14:43.600 --> 14:45.560
as storage pass-through with mild compute,

14:45.560 --> 14:47.760
now I'm thinking maybe I could use them all together.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.520
And we still have a little bit of YOLO

14:50.520 --> 14:52.200
because we want to make content.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.200
That's true.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.880
There's a lot of options in that space.

14:54.880 --> 14:58.620
You could start looking at K3S, a very lightweight Kubernetes

14:58.620 --> 15:01.600
with something like Rook and Ceph on the back end.

15:01.600 --> 15:05.120
There's a lot of ways to skin that particular turkey.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.000
Oh, OK, turkey skin.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.080
All right, yeah, well, we'll consult.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.680
It's just been on my mind recently

15:11.680 --> 15:14.800
and, you know, saw this true to that scale thing come along

15:14.800 --> 15:15.960
and it had me thinking.

15:15.960 --> 15:16.560
I like it.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.280
You know, I am a little disappointed.

15:18.280 --> 15:21.040
I was kind of hoping they'd figure out a way to make Docker.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.400
Like, it seems clear with this that they kind of had to cede,

15:23.400 --> 15:23.600
right?

15:23.600 --> 15:26.040
Like, everyone's using Docker and Kubernetes these days.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.500
I was still a little hopeful they'd

15:27.500 --> 15:29.560
figured out some kind of jank on top of jails,

15:29.560 --> 15:30.920
and that would have been neat.

15:30.920 --> 15:38.080
Lino.com slash unplugged, go there to get $100 in 60 day

15:38.080 --> 15:41.200
credit on a new account and you go there to support the show.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.760
Lino provides virtual servers that

15:42.760 --> 15:45.560
make it easy and affordable to host anything you want.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.400
And I'm talking like a big old enterprise deployment

15:48.400 --> 15:50.320
that will have millions of users,

15:50.320 --> 15:52.600
or maybe you just need a portfolio,

15:52.600 --> 15:56.040
or maybe you want to experiment with an open source project,

15:56.040 --> 15:57.640
or try going from something that's

15:57.640 --> 15:59.880
proprietary on the cloud like Zoom

15:59.880 --> 16:02.640
to something you can host yourself like Jitsi.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.800
So if you're into gaming, maybe you

16:04.800 --> 16:06.160
want to host a gaming server.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.360
What I'm trying to tell you is that Linode

16:08.360 --> 16:11.240
has built a system that is 30% to 50% cheaper

16:11.240 --> 16:13.840
than those big hypervisor duopolies out there,

16:13.840 --> 16:15.920
but yet can provide enough horsepower

16:15.920 --> 16:17.840
to run your entire enterprise.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.120
Which means that's just a great option for everybody.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.840
Developers also love Linode, and they

16:22.840 --> 16:27.120
have one of the best, cleanest, and well-documented APIs

16:27.120 --> 16:28.240
in the business.

16:28.240 --> 16:31.400
People should take notes from Linode on how they do this.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.800
I mean, they've been doing it for nearly 19 years,

16:33.800 --> 16:34.880
so they get it right.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.880
And for those of you who are into security,

16:36.880 --> 16:39.880
like real nuts and bolts security,

16:39.880 --> 16:43.000
this is something I probably should have mentioned earlier.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.800
But Linode's security team publishes weekly Linode

16:45.800 --> 16:47.400
security digests.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.040
And they go through ranges of dates,

16:49.040 --> 16:50.600
and they'll cover a series of things.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.880
Like they posted one on February 25th, and one

16:52.880 --> 16:54.720
on February 1st, et cetera.

16:54.720 --> 16:58.560
And they are just packed full of good information.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.240
You know, Linode's on the front lines of this kind of stuff.

17:01.240 --> 17:04.280
Imagine what their security team is seeing.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.200
And a while ago, they realized they

17:06.200 --> 17:07.680
could help the industry do better

17:07.680 --> 17:09.640
by sharing this information.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.440
So if you're in the biz, go check that out.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.880
We'll have a link in the show notes.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.840
And while you're over there, go create a new account.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.000
Go experiment.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.560
Go try things and support the show.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.400
There's never been a better time to take advantage of Linode

17:22.400 --> 17:25.640
and learn something new, and maybe even build yourself

17:25.640 --> 17:28.080
a bit of a multi-cloud strategy.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.280
You know what I mean?

17:29.280 --> 17:30.400
I think you do.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.800
So sign up today at linode.com slash unplugged

17:32.800 --> 17:35.920
and get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account

17:35.920 --> 17:37.160
and support the show.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.840
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.880
So if TrueNAS scale was the perfect server

17:45.880 --> 17:48.840
for a small business, this next server

17:48.840 --> 17:52.680
might be the personal perfect server for you

17:52.680 --> 17:55.000
if you'd like to set up your own sovereign bank

17:55.000 --> 17:57.680
and install a bunch of open source applications

17:57.680 --> 17:59.240
we talk about all the time.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.080
And we decided to talk about Umbral this week because

18:02.080 --> 18:03.600
of the situation in Ukraine.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.400
It's absolutely horrible what's happening.

18:05.400 --> 18:08.520
We don't normally even touch on this kind of stuff in the show.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.640
But a lot of us had the sense that we

18:10.640 --> 18:12.200
wanted to do something.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.680
And there's not really anything practical

18:14.680 --> 18:17.760
that we could do from this distance

18:17.760 --> 18:21.960
other than likely financially support the resistance,

18:21.960 --> 18:23.320
the people specifically.

18:23.320 --> 18:24.920
We have listeners in Ukraine.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.160
I've heard from some of them.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.560
Some of them are in our matrix room right now.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.440
And so we feel for what's going on over there.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.760
And we wanted to talk about Umbral in this context.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.040
And as we start, I think it's noteworthy

18:37.040 --> 18:42.720
that 107 Bitcoin have been sent over to Ukraine,

18:42.720 --> 18:47.360
to the Ukrainian government on Twitter, a post,

18:47.360 --> 18:50.200
I can't believe I'm saying this, posted their official crypto

18:50.200 --> 18:54.080
address wallets for Ethereum and Bitcoin and whatnot

18:54.080 --> 18:56.440
and have received an unbelievable amount of money.

18:56.440 --> 18:57.760
I mean, I think we did the math.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.520
And that's something like $4 million,

18:59.520 --> 19:02.360
more than $4 million that's been sent now.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.200
Every time we check the page, it's gone up.

19:04.200 --> 19:07.000
They have spent 54 of the 107 Bitcoin

19:07.000 --> 19:08.600
that's been sent to them.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.840
I've heard from a listener that used some Bitcoin

19:11.840 --> 19:14.400
to buy a car to get out of there.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.800
The used car dealership started accepting Bitcoin.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.080
It's incredible to watch all of this happen.

19:20.080 --> 19:24.160
And that's kind of what got us thinking about this.

19:24.160 --> 19:28.080
And the way Umbral fits in is Umbral is a software package

19:28.080 --> 19:30.960
that you can run either on a Raspberry Pi,

19:30.960 --> 19:33.640
or you could run it on an x86 box.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.200
We find it works best if you use Ubuntu 20.04 and their script.

19:37.200 --> 19:41.920
And what it does is it sets up a local Bitcoin node.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.280
This doesn't mine.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.400
It's not using your GPU.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.560
It's not doing anything like that.

19:47.560 --> 19:51.520
It's simply adding one more node to the consensus generation

19:51.520 --> 19:52.080
network.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.000
It's helping validate transactions.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
It helps decentralize the network

19:56.000 --> 19:57.600
and keep the transactions secure.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.600
Following along and checking the math.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.840
And the nice thing is you just install Umbral,

20:01.840 --> 20:04.480
and you get the Bitcoin node as just part of its function.

20:04.480 --> 20:05.600
It does take some space.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.000
So you want to have about a terabyte of free space.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.040
And it will run in the background.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.480
You don't have to do anything.

20:10.480 --> 20:14.440
And what you get with Umbral is essentially an app store

20:14.440 --> 20:17.920
of some of the best open source apps that are out there.

20:17.920 --> 20:21.360
Absolutely, Nextcloud is on that list.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.720
Matrix is on that list.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.400
Hosting your own Bitwarden server is on that list.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.120
A lot of the things we, Home Assistant,

20:28.120 --> 20:29.700
a lot of the things we talk about,

20:29.700 --> 20:34.080
PyHole, Prism for photo library management,

20:34.080 --> 20:35.560
that's all on there.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.760
In addition to that, there is a suite

20:37.760 --> 20:41.840
of software that lets you manage your Bitcoin stuff locally.

20:41.840 --> 20:42.840
It is a node.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.800
So you can use that as your own source of truth

20:44.800 --> 20:45.800
for the Bitcoin network.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.960
And you can point wallet applications at it.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.480
And it can also act as a local bank for you.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.240
So as an example, and I talk more about this

20:53.240 --> 20:55.580
on a new podcast that a friend of the network

20:55.580 --> 20:58.080
has launched called the Bitcoin Dad podcast,

20:58.080 --> 21:00.320
I have set up family wallets.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.540
So my kids all have wallets.

21:02.540 --> 21:06.320
And they get allowance in Lightning Payments.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.840
That lives on this node.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.880
And you can do things like multi-sigs,

21:10.880 --> 21:13.480
where you can have a key and your kids can have a key,

21:13.480 --> 21:15.600
so the money can't be spent unless you both authorize

21:15.600 --> 21:16.880
that money gets spent.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.040
And they have software that lets you do that.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.800
And you can also run a Lightning node,

21:20.800 --> 21:23.520
which is how we're receiving and sending payments

21:23.520 --> 21:26.600
and participating in that transaction network, which

21:26.600 --> 21:28.840
I think has a lot of potential to help fund open source

21:28.840 --> 21:30.240
software long term.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.280
And I don't say that lightly.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.200
So it offers a lot of features.

21:34.200 --> 21:37.200
And I think one of the more noteworthy things about Umbral

21:37.200 --> 21:42.000
is for both Brent and I, it made the Bitcoin thing real.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.880
It took it from this nebulous concept into something

21:44.880 --> 21:47.240
that we were hosting ourselves.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.080
And we had full self-sovereignty over.

21:50.080 --> 21:50.920
Yeah, I could tell.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.240
Because I wasn't at the studio, but you guys

21:53.240 --> 21:54.520
were doing all kinds of projects.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.080
And I just get spammed with links from both of you

21:57.080 --> 22:00.080
getting really excited about everything you were setting up.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.800
I remember opening up, I was like, oh, this thing's got GITTI.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.640
It's got Synapse.

22:03.640 --> 22:04.600
But look at all this stuff.

22:04.600 --> 22:05.760
It's like one button away.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.760
And I'm like, OK, but it must be a mess under the hood.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.560
And underneath, it's all very clean.

22:11.560 --> 22:13.920
It's using NGINX as a proxy.

22:13.920 --> 22:15.760
And then behind it is Docker.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.880
And what it does is when you install an app,

22:18.880 --> 22:22.080
it does like a git checkout that includes some information

22:22.080 --> 22:24.440
and a Docker compose file.

22:24.440 --> 22:27.080
And then it's doing a Docker compose run under the hood.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.960
And then when it's doing updates for the quote unquote apps,

22:29.960 --> 22:33.400
it's just pulling down a new image and deploying it.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.240
And it's very clean.

22:35.240 --> 22:38.000
And because of that, I've been able to actually dig around

22:38.000 --> 22:39.960
in there and troubleshoot several things.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.040
I talked recently about how Wes went in there

22:42.040 --> 22:44.360
and helped us troubleshoot something with the Helipad

22:44.360 --> 22:45.560
messaging system.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.480
You can get in under the hood, and you can actually

22:48.480 --> 22:50.120
see what it is and understand it.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.780
Because it's all using good practices, common sense stacks.

22:53.780 --> 22:56.880
It's not some weird black magic script thing

22:56.880 --> 22:59.080
that's happening where it's doing all this weird stuff

22:59.080 --> 22:59.680
on your box.

22:59.680 --> 23:02.400
And so I like it from sort of an aesthetic,

23:02.400 --> 23:05.880
as a former sys admin, I like it from that kind of standpoint

23:05.880 --> 23:06.360
as well.

23:06.360 --> 23:08.160
But when Brendan and I started working on this,

23:08.160 --> 23:09.760
Brent, I had a sense from you, too,

23:09.760 --> 23:12.440
that it brought it to something that was really tangible,

23:12.440 --> 23:15.040
that it was participating in like a decentralized network.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.280
Yeah, it certainly was something that we've

23:16.280 --> 23:17.480
talked about over the years.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.020
You know, oh, Bitcoin is super interesting,

23:19.020 --> 23:20.520
and I knew you were getting into it.

23:20.520 --> 23:23.560
But when we were together at the studio recently,

23:23.560 --> 23:26.860
I don't know what brought us to just kind of totally dive

23:26.860 --> 23:28.240
in full steam ahead.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.560
But it just brought all these concepts together for me

23:32.560 --> 23:35.680
to like this tangible piece of software

23:35.680 --> 23:37.720
that you and I could discuss right in front of us.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.480
Oh, let's try this.

23:38.480 --> 23:39.280
Oh, what about this?

23:39.280 --> 23:40.120
How does this work?

23:40.120 --> 23:43.480
And not to mention, you know, some of the apps

23:43.480 --> 23:46.880
are really quite a wonderful visualization

23:46.880 --> 23:50.220
of how some of the Bitcoin technology works as well.

23:50.220 --> 23:55.080
I found that really helpful as someone who visually, that's

23:55.080 --> 23:57.920
a better way for me to kind of learn and grasp concepts.

23:57.920 --> 24:01.040
So I just thought as a way to play with technology,

24:01.040 --> 24:03.880
you know, I'm relatively new to some of the Docker stuff.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.440
That was super fun.

24:05.440 --> 24:08.400
And as a way to understand, you know,

24:08.400 --> 24:12.480
some pretty neat technology like Bitcoin, that was really fun.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.360
And just for you and I to be in the same room

24:14.360 --> 24:16.980
doing this together was just an amazing experience.

24:16.980 --> 24:20.040
And now we've sort of turned you into a reporter in the field,

24:20.040 --> 24:22.040
because you've been setting up your own node, right?

24:22.040 --> 24:22.840
Yeah, it's true.

24:22.840 --> 24:28.160
You guys sicked me to go set up my own instance of Umbral.

24:28.160 --> 24:29.700
And so the first time around, Chris,

24:29.700 --> 24:31.080
you did all the heavy lifting.

24:31.080 --> 24:33.080
I just kind of watched you and cheered you on.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.760
But this time around, I got to really sink my teeth in.

24:35.760 --> 24:37.680
Maybe as we standardly do, I don't

24:37.680 --> 24:40.360
think I did it in a way that we would recommend.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.860
So we just kind of booted up a VPS

24:42.860 --> 24:44.520
and installed it on there, which I

24:44.520 --> 24:48.280
don't know if that's the recommended way to do it.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.080
I mean, I don't know.

24:49.080 --> 24:49.840
Why not?

24:49.840 --> 24:51.320
It could be a decent way to get a few apps.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.480
The thing about with Linode is they just got,

24:53.480 --> 24:55.520
you could do a one-click deployment of Nextcloud.

24:55.520 --> 24:57.240
So you don't really need to install software that

24:57.240 --> 24:59.080
helps you get Nextcloud going, you know what I mean,

24:59.080 --> 25:00.040
that kind of thing.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.800
But if you wanted one box and you

25:01.800 --> 25:04.400
wanted to run several apps at once,

25:04.400 --> 25:05.800
I might do it for the horsepower.

25:05.800 --> 25:09.480
Well, I guess my question was, one of the obvious benefits

25:09.480 --> 25:11.820
to us was kind of the throughput on the network

25:11.820 --> 25:13.160
so we could download the blockchain

25:13.160 --> 25:14.400
as quick as possible.

25:14.400 --> 25:17.640
But the real question that I had around that was,

25:17.640 --> 25:20.240
I know running your own node and having your own wallets

25:20.240 --> 25:22.840
in a piece of software is, they even say it.

25:22.840 --> 25:25.920
The Umbral folks suggest, don't be reckless about this.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.420
This can be real money, so don't put anything on here

25:28.420 --> 25:31.400
that you're not willing to lose, they specifically say.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.960
So I wondered, maybe this is a question for all three of you,

25:35.960 --> 25:40.880
is running a node like this super interesting and really

25:40.880 --> 25:43.120
helpful to the Bitcoin network, and it

25:43.120 --> 25:45.680
runs all these other pieces of software

25:45.680 --> 25:48.720
that we really care about, and it makes it super easy.

25:48.720 --> 25:51.200
But the question I have is, is it a good idea

25:51.200 --> 25:53.240
to bundle these things?

25:53.240 --> 25:55.960
Running a node and having your own Bitcoin

25:55.960 --> 26:00.200
on a software wallet on there potentially is one risk,

26:00.200 --> 26:03.200
but then you open up all of these other pieces

26:03.200 --> 26:05.760
of software as potential attack surfaces?

26:05.760 --> 26:06.760
What do you guys think?

26:06.760 --> 26:08.680
I think it depends on how you use the node.

26:08.680 --> 26:11.520
You could use the node as a source of truth

26:11.520 --> 26:14.600
for a wallet software that you run on your machine.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.920
Ideally, though, you don't want to store large amounts

26:16.920 --> 26:19.440
of Bitcoin on any computer that's

26:19.440 --> 26:21.200
connected to the internet.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.480
It's just not a good practice in general, because as the value

26:24.480 --> 26:26.800
of Bitcoin goes up, which eventually it

26:26.800 --> 26:29.280
will do again one day, it'll become even more

26:29.280 --> 26:30.840
of an enticing target.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.800
So when they say don't keep anything you're not

26:32.800 --> 26:35.280
willing to lose, that's essentially what they're saying.

26:35.280 --> 26:38.120
I keep about $600 on my node.

26:38.120 --> 26:39.600
You can actually see the information

26:39.600 --> 26:41.320
if you look up the node address.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.640
And I do that in part so I can add liquidity

26:43.640 --> 26:44.560
to different channels.

26:44.560 --> 26:47.400
We open up to people for different Bitcoin,

26:47.400 --> 26:49.640
or yeah, lightning Bitcoin transactions.

26:49.640 --> 26:52.720
But think of it more, Brent, not as a bank

26:52.720 --> 26:56.040
where you store your money, but as your personal source

26:56.040 --> 26:58.240
of truth for what is a transaction on the network

26:58.240 --> 26:59.920
and when you submit a transaction.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.920
It also lets you interface with the network

27:01.920 --> 27:04.440
in sort of a first class way, like you're not using

27:04.440 --> 27:06.000
an exchange or another third party.

27:06.000 --> 27:06.760
Right.

27:06.760 --> 27:08.520
It's definitely one of the more secure ways

27:08.520 --> 27:10.040
to do that kind of thing.

27:10.040 --> 27:13.760
And the node function doesn't take a lot of overhead,

27:13.760 --> 27:16.760
because they've designed this thing to run on a Raspberry Pi.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.640
So it's a nice kind of low key way to support the network.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.760
And then you go into the app store.

27:21.760 --> 27:24.200
And they have done a really good job of adding apps too,

27:24.200 --> 27:26.880
because I've been running this since December.

27:26.880 --> 27:30.640
And there's been probably about three updates since then.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.360
And each update has added stuff, like the recent one

27:33.360 --> 27:35.080
added tail scale.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.200
And that's been really nice.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.760
They a little while ago had uptime kuma added,

27:39.760 --> 27:41.360
which I started using.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.520
That's been really cool.

27:42.520 --> 27:43.760
Yeah, it was interesting.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.560
I kind of noticed like back in, I guess, August, a little

27:45.560 --> 27:47.960
before we discovered it, but they had a blog post sort

27:47.960 --> 27:50.960
of writing that Umbral isn't just a Bitcoin and Lightning

27:50.960 --> 27:51.560
node.

27:51.560 --> 27:54.680
It's a personal server OS that helps anyone

27:54.680 --> 27:55.840
have control of their data.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.320
And I guess that's like maybe that's

27:57.320 --> 27:59.640
some of the motivation for having these things, right?

27:59.640 --> 28:02.560
Once you're thinking about maybe how you're interfacing

28:02.560 --> 28:04.680
with your various cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin

28:04.680 --> 28:06.440
and Lightning, then you're also starting to wonder like, oh,

28:06.440 --> 28:09.040
yeah, I am putting a lot of other stuff out

28:09.040 --> 28:11.440
on the internet, aren't I?

28:11.440 --> 28:14.640
Alex, I know you're not a big fan of the front end.

28:14.640 --> 28:15.840
Let us set things up for you.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.240
But there's a couple of exceptions.

28:17.240 --> 28:19.880
You've got a little love for a couple of projects

28:19.880 --> 28:21.400
out there like Unraid.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.160
What do you think of something like Umbral

28:23.160 --> 28:25.720
where it's, I think we have to be honest,

28:25.720 --> 28:27.360
it's first a Bitcoin node.

28:27.360 --> 28:29.680
But then one of the things they've done on the back end

28:29.680 --> 28:32.200
is they've just added all this other stuff that's

28:32.200 --> 28:33.880
become so popular.

28:33.880 --> 28:38.080
I'd say like the top 20 self-hosted apps are on there.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.200
It looks fantastic.

28:40.200 --> 28:43.560
The design language that they're using for the interface

28:43.560 --> 28:45.560
is just beautiful.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.360
I look at it and I think, I wish I

28:47.360 --> 28:48.680
could use this for everything.

28:48.680 --> 28:51.800
I wish there was a plug-in, say, for MergerFS.

28:51.800 --> 28:53.760
I wish there was a plug-in for SnapRaid,

28:53.760 --> 28:55.880
all that kind of stuff, like out of the box.

28:55.880 --> 28:58.240
Because I would genuinely be quite tempted

28:58.240 --> 29:02.080
to see if this could replace my Proxmox deployment.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.320
Because I don't really use very many virtual machines.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.640
I run Home Assistant as a VM.

29:06.640 --> 29:10.960
I run FedoraBox for IRC purposes for work

29:10.960 --> 29:12.440
that has to be on a VPN.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.200
Apart from that, I don't really utilize anything else

29:15.200 --> 29:18.200
of Proxmox's virtualization features.

29:18.200 --> 29:23.440
So I wonder, if we push this project further down the road,

29:23.440 --> 29:25.800
is that a possibility for the future?

29:25.800 --> 29:31.400
Like, can we work on a beautiful storage UI for this thing

29:31.400 --> 29:34.240
and turn it into the base platform

29:34.240 --> 29:37.720
for a future TrueNAS competitor?

29:37.720 --> 29:39.560
From what I have gathered from the outside,

29:39.560 --> 29:43.160
the dev team seems pretty easy to work with

29:43.160 --> 29:46.440
and pretty willing to work with projects to integrate them.

29:46.440 --> 29:48.520
And so far, because of the way they've

29:48.520 --> 29:51.240
designed the base system, they seem

29:51.240 --> 29:53.800
to be pretty flexible in what they can integrate.

29:53.800 --> 29:54.880
And they do it in a clean way.

29:54.880 --> 29:59.640
And I have installed stuff, removed stuff.

29:59.640 --> 30:02.680
I've gone the whole, like, talk to a developer

30:02.680 --> 30:04.100
to get a beta version of something

30:04.100 --> 30:04.880
to get that installed.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.160
Like, I've tried the whole gambit

30:06.160 --> 30:07.200
of messing around with this thing.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.520
And it's been really reliable.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.720
It's really held up.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.040
So the team seems to be very clever in how

30:12.040 --> 30:13.160
they've built this.

30:13.160 --> 30:16.760
I also like that, because it is so approachable,

30:16.760 --> 30:20.080
it really is conceivable that a free software

30:20.080 --> 30:22.800
project like the GNOME project, although they probably would

30:22.800 --> 30:25.280
never want to associate with something as earth

30:25.280 --> 30:28.040
incinerating as Bitcoin, but a project that

30:28.040 --> 30:29.800
looked into the actual environmental impacts

30:29.800 --> 30:31.680
would probably be willing to run something like this.

30:31.680 --> 30:33.720
And then they would have their own lightning note.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.320
And the reason why that is significant

30:35.320 --> 30:37.520
is I could open up a channel to them.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.960
And then they would be connected to a popular lightning

30:39.960 --> 30:42.340
node that would be really quick and cheap to route through.

30:42.340 --> 30:45.320
And it'd be their own self-custodial way

30:45.320 --> 30:47.880
to receive contributions.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.440
Like, that's a big deal.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.840
Because right now, these projects

30:50.840 --> 30:52.360
have to go through some third party.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.720
There's some master.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.040
There's some middleman.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.600
And like, when we were just talking about contributing

30:57.600 --> 30:59.040
to the Ukraine Defense Force, you're

30:59.040 --> 31:00.920
contributing to Ukraine listeners,

31:00.920 --> 31:04.360
Patreon just blocked a transaction because it was

31:04.360 --> 31:05.920
going over to somebody in Ukraine.

31:05.920 --> 31:08.520
And that kind of thing, the middleman,

31:08.520 --> 31:11.360
even when they intend to do the right thing,

31:11.360 --> 31:12.920
they often mess it up.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.000
And when it comes to software and speech,

31:15.000 --> 31:18.020
I just feel like we've got to get rid of the middleman

31:18.020 --> 31:19.520
as much as possible.

31:19.520 --> 31:22.980
And that's why I'm so compelled to talk about this right now.

31:22.980 --> 31:24.680
Because I feel like having self-control

31:24.680 --> 31:26.680
over this kind of stuff is more of a topic than ever.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.080
Because it's not just what's going on in Ukraine.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.080
There's all kinds of stuff going on right now.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.120
And this gives people access.

31:33.120 --> 31:36.200
And Umbral also sells a hardware product

31:36.200 --> 31:41.320
that somebody who maybe has more money than they do time

31:41.320 --> 31:44.080
could grab that and participate and have access

31:44.080 --> 31:47.740
to a really solidly set up, self-hosted platform

31:47.740 --> 31:49.320
with a lot of really cool apps on there.

31:49.320 --> 31:50.760
And so I think it's worth a try.

31:50.760 --> 31:54.780
Even if you don't use the Bitcoin stuff,

31:54.780 --> 31:58.280
I suppose you could always SSH in and just stop the node

31:58.280 --> 31:59.040
container.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.120
Yeah, you know, XMN in the IRC was kind of asking,

32:01.120 --> 32:03.580
is that, can you just use it for some of the more self-hosted

32:03.580 --> 32:05.760
stuff and not have the Bitcoin parts?

32:05.760 --> 32:08.160
I absolutely have shut off the node at times

32:08.160 --> 32:10.040
when we were trying stuff.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.200
So that is possible.

32:11.200 --> 32:15.080
But I actually am striving for as much uptime as possible.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.760
Brent was here doing construction work.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.680
And I was like, don't shut down the Bitcoin node.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.220
Yeah, it was days of negotiation to get you to accept

32:22.220 --> 32:24.400
that the power might go off.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.020
Yeah, because in the Lightning Network,

32:26.020 --> 32:27.800
at least, your uptime matters.

32:27.800 --> 32:30.520
They consider that part of your reliability.

32:30.520 --> 32:31.560
OK, two things.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.060
One, I think maybe we should mention

32:33.060 --> 32:36.480
that they're using a particular license, the Polyform

32:36.480 --> 32:38.480
non-commercial license, for folks that

32:38.480 --> 32:39.520
care about that kind of thing.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.520
And then I also was just noticing their hiring.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.320
And that made me reflect that there

32:43.320 --> 32:44.600
is a company behind this, right?

32:44.600 --> 32:45.860
It's an open source project.

32:45.860 --> 32:47.760
But also, there's more going on.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.400
Yeah, they've raised some money.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.280
They got $3 million in seed funding.

32:52.280 --> 32:54.840
So they were, I think, able to do some hiring with that.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.600
It's not a lot.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.320
But you combine that with a hardware product

32:59.320 --> 33:01.000
that maybe gets some sales.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.360
It's a cool looking device.

33:03.360 --> 33:06.320
It's a little expensive, though.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.480
I don't know if you guys, if you go on their website,

33:08.480 --> 33:09.680
they have two options.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.360
And one of them is install on a Raspberry Pi.

33:12.360 --> 33:15.320
And one of them is install Umbral on Linux.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.240
We had the best results with Ubuntu.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.860
But if you dig around their website,

33:18.860 --> 33:21.240
they do offer hardware, or they used to.

33:21.240 --> 33:22.320
Maybe they will again.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.040
So talk me through the requirements of this thing,

33:25.040 --> 33:27.200
in terms of disk space and all the rest of it.

33:27.200 --> 33:31.000
Because are you syncing the entire blockchain down?

33:31.000 --> 33:32.720
I don't really understand how it works.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.880
We did have to do a little pre-planning for the show

33:34.880 --> 33:37.200
to make sure Brent's experiment synced in time.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.200
Yeah.

33:38.200 --> 33:41.320
Yeah, I had to add some block storage to the Linode

33:41.320 --> 33:42.440
that we were running it on.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.680
Which, for me, was a great learning experience, actually.

33:44.680 --> 33:45.960
So just putting that out there.

33:45.960 --> 33:47.680
Yeah, just getting that disk attached to the system

33:47.680 --> 33:48.200
and all that.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.720
We'll get to Alex's question in a sec here.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.720
But from the point of view of someone like me,

33:51.720 --> 33:55.120
who is pretty Docker uninitiated and just playing

33:55.120 --> 33:57.640
with all this technology and just curious about how it all

33:57.640 --> 33:59.480
works, it was a fabulous experience

33:59.480 --> 34:04.520
to go and have to attach some block storage to this

34:04.520 --> 34:07.280
and do a little change in the Docker Compose file and stuff.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.440
And it was a nice way to just kind of dip

34:09.440 --> 34:11.040
my toe in some of these technologies.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.960
And I had more fun than I expected, actually.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.200
I'm feeling pretty giddy about it, actually.

34:16.200 --> 34:17.720
It is a lot of fun.

34:17.720 --> 34:20.640
So what your question was, Alex, about the blockchain download.

34:20.640 --> 34:21.800
You download the blockchain.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.040
I have some stats here.

34:23.040 --> 34:27.600
Ours is using about 467 gigs for the blockchain storage.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.480
So they recommend 600 gigs.

34:30.480 --> 34:33.760
I think if you want some future proofing, around a terabyte

34:33.760 --> 34:34.960
is probably a good idea.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.880
That's why I said earlier, just plan for a terabyte for that.

34:37.880 --> 34:40.040
And if that doesn't appeal to you,

34:40.040 --> 34:42.000
you might not consider Umbral.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.880
You might want to consider something else.

34:43.880 --> 34:44.800
I will be honest.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.720
Part of the draw for me is participating

34:46.720 --> 34:49.400
in the decentralized consensus part of the network.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.720
And the nice thing about Bitcoin is

34:51.720 --> 34:54.600
that you can just install a node.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.560
You can get it as a Docker container.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.480
You don't have to participate in the mining, in any of that.

34:59.480 --> 35:00.760
And you can still add value.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.560
You can add decentralization.

35:02.560 --> 35:05.420
That has always been something that I've loved.

35:05.420 --> 35:07.120
I've always been into that kind of stuff,

35:07.120 --> 35:08.840
for as long as I've been into computers.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.600
So a terabyte would cut it then.

35:10.600 --> 35:13.000
And presumably, that's going to grow over time.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.600
Do you have any sense as to how much it's going to grow?

35:16.600 --> 35:17.440
How quick?

35:17.440 --> 35:20.120
I decided to put an eight terabyte disk in my machine,

35:20.120 --> 35:21.500
I think is what I did, ultimately,

35:21.500 --> 35:24.560
just to not worry about it for five, six, seven years.

35:24.560 --> 35:29.340
But they say plan for a terabyte to two terabytes long term.

35:29.340 --> 35:31.840
Or you mean you put an eight terabyte drive in there,

35:31.840 --> 35:33.640
because that's what we shucked at the sprint

35:33.640 --> 35:35.400
and what Brent found in a box.

35:35.400 --> 35:36.360
Yeah.

35:36.360 --> 35:37.100
Let's be honest.

35:37.100 --> 35:39.000
That's our planning, really.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.880
But I didn't partition it.

35:41.880 --> 35:42.640
Yeah.

35:42.640 --> 35:47.040
I'd say, I'm going to run this until the machine dies, really.

35:47.040 --> 35:50.860
This is one of my, I'm not, I know it sounds ridiculous.

35:50.860 --> 35:52.280
I'm not shitting you.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.240
This is one of my most favorite projects

35:54.240 --> 35:57.040
in probably the last four or five years I've done.

35:57.040 --> 35:57.920
I just love it.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.400
It has been so great.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.840
And the community is so great.

36:00.840 --> 36:05.320
And to participate in something as big as this

36:05.320 --> 36:07.920
is, I think, an awesome opportunity.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.400
And I love that it's free software.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.400
I'm not just talking about Umbral.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.680
I'm talking about Bitcoin.

36:11.680 --> 36:12.640
I'm talking about Linux.

36:12.640 --> 36:15.700
I'm talking about the Docker stuff that it's using.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.740
It's incredible where this stack has gotten.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.820
And it's pretty easy.

36:19.820 --> 36:22.000
They give you information on how to submit your own app

36:22.000 --> 36:23.440
to their app store, too.

36:23.440 --> 36:26.560
I think one of those examples is one of the apps

36:26.560 --> 36:29.120
that I think has been giving you a lot of the fun

36:29.120 --> 36:31.660
is Helipad, which Dave Jones was just packaged up

36:31.660 --> 36:33.440
and got included in Umbral, right?

36:33.440 --> 36:35.160
It doesn't seem like it's a big hurdle

36:35.160 --> 36:37.520
to get stuff added, which is important at this stage.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.000
Yep.

36:38.000 --> 36:38.920
That's very true.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.040
Yeah, that's been a great app.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.340
And that comes right in there.

36:41.340 --> 36:43.800
And so when those boosts come into the show,

36:43.800 --> 36:46.080
they come in via the Lightning Network.

36:46.080 --> 36:49.800
And they sit on a node on my LAN.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.200
And I think about this from a small business standpoint.

36:52.200 --> 36:56.880
Imagine a future where free software projects and content

36:56.880 --> 37:00.400
like JB is getting a significant bit of its funding

37:00.400 --> 37:03.640
from micropayments directly from the audience at scale.

37:03.640 --> 37:07.520
And the things like advertisers and those kinds of things

37:07.520 --> 37:09.680
are maybe playing less and less of a role.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.320
And this starts playing more and more of a role.

37:12.320 --> 37:15.260
Now, how empowering is that, that that's

37:15.260 --> 37:17.720
a box sitting on my LAN, right?

37:17.720 --> 37:19.800
It's not a Stripe account.

37:19.800 --> 37:20.880
It's not PayPal.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.920
It's not my local bank.

37:22.920 --> 37:26.040
It feels like a true value for value exchange,

37:26.040 --> 37:28.760
where the audience is giving me something.

37:28.760 --> 37:31.520
And they came into my storefront.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.280
And then I'm taking it, and I'm putting it in a register,

37:34.280 --> 37:37.340
a cash register that's there at my store.

37:37.340 --> 37:41.560
It fundamentally changes the status of ownership.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.240
And it feels like security to me.

37:44.240 --> 37:46.280
It feels safe to me.

37:46.280 --> 37:50.440
As a business, it feels like that is actually mine now

37:50.440 --> 37:53.320
and not something that somebody else is holding for me

37:53.320 --> 37:55.760
that they give me access to until they don't.

37:55.760 --> 37:57.640
And that is a big shift.

37:57.640 --> 38:01.000
Imagine a future where you can pay for a road trip using

38:01.000 --> 38:03.960
those funds, where the audience think,

38:03.960 --> 38:07.840
Chris has just put out a plea for a few dollars

38:07.840 --> 38:10.760
to come to the East Coast in lady dupes.

38:10.760 --> 38:15.360
Imagine a future where all of that is just local,

38:15.360 --> 38:18.640
and the US dollar isn't really involved until you cash out.

38:18.640 --> 38:19.140
Right.

38:19.140 --> 38:21.200
That's a cool thing to think about, no?

38:21.200 --> 38:22.400
I think so.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.920
I think it gives people a lot of freedom.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.640
I think it's pretty neat to see it happening.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.720
And it's still a little early, but that's

38:29.720 --> 38:31.760
usually when we start talking about this stuff.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.080
It makes me think about when we went down the effort

38:34.080 --> 38:36.560
of hosting our own email, not because you necessarily

38:36.560 --> 38:39.280
should, but I think we also got some kind of giddy vibes

38:39.280 --> 38:40.820
of like, oh, we just ran this thing,

38:40.820 --> 38:44.080
and now we're participating in a wider ecosystem.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.480
And there's a lot about this stuff

38:45.480 --> 38:47.880
that has those old internet era vibes.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.000
Thank you to our members at unpluggedcore.com.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.880
You're playing a big role these days keeping the show going.

38:55.880 --> 38:58.100
As a thank you, we give you access

38:58.100 --> 39:01.140
to the full live feed that's like, I don't know,

39:01.140 --> 39:02.760
way too much show.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.680
Irresponsibly long, that's what happens.

39:05.680 --> 39:06.760
That's true.

39:06.760 --> 39:10.240
Or option two is ad-free, nice and tight.

39:10.240 --> 39:14.120
Still got that nice Joe polish, just a little bit shorter.

39:14.120 --> 39:16.400
And that goes out in the feed when the show's ready.

39:16.400 --> 39:16.920
Your choice.

39:16.920 --> 39:20.080
Usually the longer live feeds out

39:20.080 --> 39:22.640
within about an hour of our recording or so.

39:22.640 --> 39:25.920
So it goes out pretty quick on a Sunday evening local time.

39:25.920 --> 39:26.920
We love your feedback.

39:26.920 --> 39:29.240
We want to make more and more of that a part of the show.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.640
Your ideas, your suggestions, your responses

39:31.640 --> 39:33.520
to what we've talked about, agree or disagree,

39:33.520 --> 39:37.560
linuxunplug.com slash contact, send it in over there.

39:37.560 --> 39:39.400
And our matrix community is always growing.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.840
There's people talking right now.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.600
Linuxunplug.com slash matrix.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.720
You never know, one day it may replace that chat

39:45.720 --> 39:46.840
embedded on the website.

39:46.840 --> 39:49.000
So why not get involved one night?

39:49.000 --> 39:52.880
You're sitting around, you got your beverage of choice,

39:52.880 --> 39:54.440
linuxunplug.com slash matrix.

39:54.440 --> 39:55.720
Go get it set up.

39:55.720 --> 39:58.560
The love plug is happening before the show on Sundays.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.680
I usually pop in there for a bit and say, holla.

40:00.680 --> 40:04.080
Or today I was chasing a power supply demon.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.040
Either way.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.480
And that's always going, really.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.480
I'd say set it up and pop in there on a Tuesday,

40:09.480 --> 40:09.960
see who's in there.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.480
Pop in there on a Monday, I don't know.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.040
Yeah, what could it hurt, you know?

40:13.040 --> 40:15.200
I mean, worst case, you make some new best friends

40:15.200 --> 40:17.600
and you'll have a lot of fun.

40:17.600 --> 40:18.640
That's the worst case.

40:18.640 --> 40:19.440
You got to do it.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.760
Linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

40:21.760 --> 40:24.960
That's where you get that action.

40:24.960 --> 40:29.440
And now, as the French say, it is time for Le Boost.

40:29.440 --> 40:34.560
Well, we'd like to say thank you to everyone for the boosts.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.920
We appreciate you very much.

40:36.920 --> 40:40.240
From anonymous sends 3,000 sats.

40:40.240 --> 40:44.040
And he says, what are your thoughts on the Simula VR?

40:44.040 --> 40:45.560
Brent, I know you saw the Simula VR

40:45.560 --> 40:47.680
and were getting pretty excited about it right away.

40:47.680 --> 40:49.000
So what are your thoughts?

40:49.000 --> 40:50.160
Yeah, I saw it early morning.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.440
And I think I spammed you guys pretty early in your time

40:52.440 --> 40:53.800
zone about a bunch of stuff.

40:53.800 --> 40:55.200
No need to apologize.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.480
Yeah, I guess we should say it's a Linux PC that's

40:58.480 --> 41:01.200
going to crowdfund, that's strapped to your face,

41:01.200 --> 41:04.920
and they are building their own window environment.

41:04.920 --> 41:05.880
With Godot.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.360
Yeah, in fact, I invited them on the show.

41:08.360 --> 41:09.880
They're looking into their schedules,

41:09.880 --> 41:11.920
but I haven't got a confirmation yet.

41:11.920 --> 41:17.360
So it's an Intel-based x86 box, fast Linux box, on your face,

41:17.360 --> 41:20.600
super high-res screen, optimized for text rendering.

41:20.600 --> 41:22.200
It seemed like it blew your socks off, Brent.

41:22.200 --> 41:24.120
Well, I think from a technical point of view

41:24.120 --> 41:28.040
and trying to accomplish some really great things point

41:28.040 --> 41:30.760
of view, it seemed like it was right up our alley.

41:30.760 --> 41:32.920
They're putting together a bunch of technologies in a way

41:32.920 --> 41:34.400
that we typically love.

41:34.400 --> 41:37.080
And Chris, part of the reason I got really excited

41:37.080 --> 41:38.680
was that you've basically been asking

41:38.680 --> 41:40.280
for this for a few months.

41:40.280 --> 41:44.360
I know you've been playing with VR at kind of a workstation,

41:44.360 --> 41:46.480
a virtual workstation for you that might

41:46.480 --> 41:47.600
solve a few of your problems.

41:47.600 --> 41:51.680
But don't you feel like this, running Linux and having

41:51.680 --> 41:54.520
a pretty powerful PC, I guess, on your face

41:54.520 --> 41:58.000
is an exciting development, if it could happen?

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
Yeah, if you would have asked me this question two weeks ago,

42:01.000 --> 42:03.300
I would have said, no, this is silly.

42:03.300 --> 42:04.800
This isn't going anywhere.

42:04.800 --> 42:07.320
Why are we doing this?

42:07.320 --> 42:10.800
But then for my birthday, I got the Oculus Quest.

42:10.800 --> 42:14.480
And it was perfect, really, because it's not something

42:14.480 --> 42:15.480
I would have expected.

42:15.480 --> 42:17.920
So it's one of those, like, my whole opinion has changed

42:17.920 --> 42:18.960
within a couple of weeks.

42:18.960 --> 42:21.480
I put it on, and I was like, OK, the gaming graphics

42:21.480 --> 42:23.340
are about exactly what I expected.

42:23.340 --> 42:26.240
It looks like a high-end Android phone graphics.

42:26.240 --> 42:29.800
Really well-done application experience, more polished

42:29.800 --> 42:31.240
than I expected.

42:31.240 --> 42:36.320
But the thing that blew me away was the virtual office stuff.

42:36.320 --> 42:38.520
And I'm not talking like the Facebook thing,

42:38.520 --> 42:40.220
but like just an app that was designed

42:40.220 --> 42:42.280
to just bring your screens.

42:42.280 --> 42:46.680
It supports multiple virtual desktops in Mac and Windows,

42:46.680 --> 42:49.520
and it supports one desktop in Linux.

42:49.520 --> 42:54.020
But I created this awesome, badass log cabin studio

42:54.020 --> 42:56.040
on top of a hill looking down on a lake

42:56.040 --> 42:59.360
with panoramic windows and a ginormous blue couch.

42:59.360 --> 43:03.000
And then I brought in five virtual screens.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.840
It was awesome.

43:04.840 --> 43:07.080
And I'm telling you, man, I sat there at my desk.

43:07.080 --> 43:08.320
We had my keyboard and mouse.

43:08.320 --> 43:09.920
So I put down the VR controllers,

43:09.920 --> 43:11.160
and I had all these screens.

43:11.160 --> 43:13.600
But each one's like 105 inches or something.

43:13.600 --> 43:14.160
I don't know.

43:14.160 --> 43:15.000
They're huge.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.400
And they're cool, curved, and they're like hovering there.

43:18.400 --> 43:23.040
And it was an awesome, isolated, focused experience.

43:23.040 --> 43:25.640
And it tamed my ADD monster, because it

43:25.640 --> 43:28.520
was like in a meditative place while also being in a home

43:28.520 --> 43:32.800
office, like the perfect, ultimate, infinite home office.

43:32.800 --> 43:35.120
And I took off the headphones, and I'm just sitting

43:35.120 --> 43:36.640
in LadyJuice's passenger seat.

43:36.640 --> 43:39.680
Seems like it might have a pretty decent spousal approval

43:39.680 --> 43:40.160
factor.

43:40.160 --> 43:41.680
For one, you're not cluttering things up

43:41.680 --> 43:43.320
with as many monitors as you want.

43:43.320 --> 43:45.280
But then two, she can kind of laugh at you

43:45.280 --> 43:46.420
while you're getting your work done looking

43:46.420 --> 43:47.920
funny with the visor on.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.960
Totally, totally, yeah.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.000
If you want to get in the zone and drop away

43:53.000 --> 43:55.480
all the distractions, it really works for that.

43:55.480 --> 43:56.640
And I was surprised.

43:56.640 --> 43:58.880
And so what they're working on with Simula

43:58.880 --> 44:00.920
is doing that for Linux.

44:00.920 --> 44:02.880
And we covered it a little bit in Linux Action,

44:02.880 --> 44:06.200
is including the Window Manager stuff and all of that.

44:06.200 --> 44:09.520
The only obvious issue is that, A, I

44:09.520 --> 44:11.400
think people are going to be pretty skeptical.

44:11.400 --> 44:13.900
You've got to try it before you're going to buy it.

44:13.900 --> 44:15.880
Like me, two weeks ago, I just would

44:15.880 --> 44:17.440
have said this is ridiculous.

44:17.440 --> 44:18.240
So you've got to try it before you're

44:18.240 --> 44:20.640
going to understand it, I feel like, for most people.

44:20.640 --> 44:23.720
And then the other thing is the price.

44:23.720 --> 44:25.600
Because they're going for something that's

44:25.600 --> 44:28.960
good performance with a modern Intel chipset

44:28.960 --> 44:30.840
and the high resolution screen that

44:30.840 --> 44:35.040
makes text look actually good, the price of that is high.

44:35.040 --> 44:38.520
And a good one's $4,000.

44:38.520 --> 44:41.080
The starter one's like $2,000.

44:41.080 --> 44:41.820
And it's tough.

44:41.820 --> 44:43.200
I mean, I guess when you consider

44:43.200 --> 44:45.160
it's also a PC that's detachable.

44:45.160 --> 44:47.080
I think one way to look at it for you, Chris,

44:47.080 --> 44:50.080
might be how much would you spend

44:50.080 --> 44:53.480
to take jupes out into a spot where you had the view that you

44:53.480 --> 44:57.680
had and sit there for being as productive as you were

44:57.680 --> 45:00.200
for even that hour that you were playing with it?

45:00.200 --> 45:03.000
Yeah, I will say the one thing that I thought about when

45:03.000 --> 45:05.280
I was trying the Oculus was like, well, this is great.

45:05.280 --> 45:07.280
But in order to use this, I always

45:07.280 --> 45:09.520
have to have a computer with me.

45:09.520 --> 45:11.920
So I have to have both devices.

45:11.920 --> 45:12.840
That's kind of lame.

45:12.840 --> 45:14.880
I might as well just use my laptop then, right?

45:14.880 --> 45:16.120
And then I don't have to.

45:16.120 --> 45:19.400
But if this is the computer too, well, that's something,

45:19.400 --> 45:20.000
actually.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.960
Then you've just got your little launch keyboard

45:21.960 --> 45:24.040
that you drag out, and away you go.

45:24.040 --> 45:25.600
I got a lot of questions.

45:25.600 --> 45:26.760
I'm skeptical.

45:26.760 --> 45:28.080
The price is tough.

45:28.080 --> 45:29.160
I'm worried about the heat.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.880
I think we've got to, if we can get them on,

45:30.880 --> 45:32.080
I'd like to just talk to somebody

45:32.080 --> 45:33.480
about some of those things.

45:33.480 --> 45:36.560
But I would say if you are skeptical,

45:36.560 --> 45:38.680
it's just worth considering that there may actually

45:38.680 --> 45:40.080
be a use case, I think especially

45:40.080 --> 45:43.020
for developers who like to have multiple monitors.

45:43.020 --> 45:45.620
Would you like to have eight monitors, three monitors?

45:45.620 --> 45:46.820
How many monitors do you want?

45:46.820 --> 45:48.140
You can have as many monitors as you want,

45:48.140 --> 45:49.240
as many screens as you want.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.900
You can have them all over the place.

45:50.900 --> 45:53.600
You can have them spatially in different locations.

45:53.600 --> 45:54.600
It's very powerful.

45:54.600 --> 45:57.680
You know, I, Chris, when we were talking about this off scene,

45:57.680 --> 46:00.720
I got inspired to watch Ready Player One, which

46:00.720 --> 46:02.160
I had never seen before.

46:02.160 --> 46:05.000
And it just made me realize that that's exactly what you're

46:05.000 --> 46:08.240
talking about, basically a whole simulated VR world where you

46:08.240 --> 46:10.280
can do just about anything you want.

46:10.280 --> 46:12.400
I thought it was really fascinating.

46:12.400 --> 46:15.440
Yeah, let's just hope it's not dystopia, you know?

46:15.440 --> 46:16.480
We'll see.

46:16.480 --> 46:17.400
We'll see.

46:17.400 --> 46:20.720
Our next boost is from Mollusk.

46:20.720 --> 46:23.740
I think Chris and Dylan should play the free trial of Final

46:23.740 --> 46:26.320
Fantasy XIV online.

46:26.320 --> 46:28.600
I've been having a blast playing nonstop for the last year

46:28.600 --> 46:30.000
with my spouse.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.640
The Loot Trace option for the third party launcher

46:32.640 --> 46:34.400
works great as long as each other launcher

46:34.400 --> 46:37.360
to use Aria 2 for downloading, which Aria 2 is great.

46:37.360 --> 46:39.460
So that's just a great pro tip.

46:39.460 --> 46:42.640
I am only Crystal Data Center if you guys need help.

46:42.640 --> 46:44.440
Go podcasting.

46:44.440 --> 46:45.120
Thank you, Mollusk.

46:45.120 --> 46:46.760
That was a great 500 sets.

46:46.760 --> 46:49.040
Yeah, OK.

46:49.040 --> 46:52.640
I'm totally looking for a co-op kind of play together game

46:52.640 --> 46:54.520
I could do with one or two of the kids.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.720
So I'll totally check that out.

46:55.720 --> 46:59.280
And I also think, Mollusk, that when I do get the deck,

46:59.280 --> 47:01.280
I think the first thing I'm going to try doing

47:01.280 --> 47:03.400
is putting Loot Trace on that, right?

47:03.400 --> 47:05.120
That just seems like the first thing you do

47:05.120 --> 47:06.960
is get Loot Trace going on a deck.

47:06.960 --> 47:09.600
So that's going to be awesome too.

47:09.600 --> 47:12.440
Hudson writes in to say, boosting for boost,

47:12.440 --> 47:14.400
it's amazing to have a current use for Bitcoin

47:14.400 --> 47:16.620
other than just saving it away for myself.

47:16.620 --> 47:18.960
I feel so much more involved with JB and Bitcoin

47:18.960 --> 47:20.640
through value for value.

47:20.640 --> 47:21.360
I agree.

47:21.360 --> 47:24.000
These messages, when they come in, these little boosts

47:24.000 --> 47:26.960
are the highlight of my day.

47:26.960 --> 47:29.280
I usually have it up on one of my monitors,

47:29.280 --> 47:32.080
get a little pew noise, and I get a little note

47:32.080 --> 47:33.400
from somebody.

47:33.400 --> 47:34.840
And sometimes it's just the SATs,

47:34.840 --> 47:36.840
and I get to know what episode they're listening to

47:36.840 --> 47:38.240
or something like that.

47:38.240 --> 47:40.360
But there are a lot of tools that are being built.

47:40.360 --> 47:44.360
XOXOXO sent in 333 SATs.

47:44.360 --> 47:46.000
3,333 SATs, yeah.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.560
Four days ago, he said, I'm working on a boost CLI.

47:49.560 --> 47:53.240
It'll send boost-o-grams to podcasts, also on a boost bot

47:53.240 --> 47:56.880
for IRC, Matrix, and Mastodon.

47:56.880 --> 47:59.240
I thought that was notable, because now you

47:59.240 --> 48:01.400
can start seeing maybe you could support a developer

48:01.400 --> 48:05.640
or a podcast from their Matrix room with a Matrix bot.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.720
Yeah, and we need these kind of handy things

48:07.720 --> 48:09.460
just to sort of lower the barrier to entry,

48:09.460 --> 48:11.680
make it really easy to show your love.

48:11.680 --> 48:14.320
And then another app I'm looking at from the user side

48:14.320 --> 48:15.960
is, so somebody wants to get in on this,

48:15.960 --> 48:17.760
but they want to get into the boost system

48:17.760 --> 48:19.260
and send us boost messages, but they

48:19.260 --> 48:22.520
don't want to go get Cast-O-Matic or Fountain.

48:22.520 --> 48:26.440
Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z, is an app that

48:26.440 --> 48:30.800
is in development for both Google and for Apple phones.

48:30.800 --> 48:33.320
So you've got to get it from the Play Store or the App Store.

48:33.320 --> 48:35.280
And right now, it's in beta, so you either

48:35.280 --> 48:37.040
have to have TestFlight or you have

48:37.040 --> 48:39.200
to agree to a Play Store beta agreement.

48:39.200 --> 48:41.520
Either way, it's an app that'll also

48:41.520 --> 48:43.720
let you listen to podcasts and get in and send messages

48:43.720 --> 48:44.940
and stuff like that.

48:44.940 --> 48:46.480
It's pretty cool, and I'm keeping an eye on it

48:46.480 --> 48:48.360
because it's in early days, but the developer

48:48.360 --> 48:49.720
seems really sharp.

48:49.720 --> 48:52.560
And the app seems like it has a lot of options.

48:52.560 --> 48:53.440
It's pretty exciting.

48:53.440 --> 48:55.080
I guess we could consider that our pick for this week.

48:55.080 --> 48:58.500
Should we consider that our pick, Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z?

48:58.500 --> 48:59.720
I think you just did.

48:59.720 --> 49:00.800
There you go.

49:00.800 --> 49:01.480
That's a lot.

49:01.480 --> 49:03.040
It all kind of ties together.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.040
It's not like we're going to focus on this stuff

49:05.040 --> 49:07.960
all the time, but it felt today like this

49:07.960 --> 49:10.120
was our way to contribute to the conversation that's

49:10.120 --> 49:13.980
going on without talking directly about the politics

49:13.980 --> 49:15.640
and all that kind of stuff that this show doesn't

49:15.640 --> 49:16.400
need to get into.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.160
Hopefully, you forgot a little bit

49:18.160 --> 49:20.840
for this one little hour about the rest of the world.

49:20.840 --> 49:22.560
Yeah, you know how you can really tune out?

49:22.560 --> 49:25.320
You really get in is when you get the live experience,

49:25.320 --> 49:26.120
right?

49:26.120 --> 49:28.080
You either become a member or you show up.

49:28.080 --> 49:29.500
You can do that on Sundays if you

49:29.500 --> 49:31.440
want to do that at noon Pacific.

49:31.440 --> 49:34.000
We're hanging out over at jblive.tv.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.680
I suppose one of the ways you could get the show

49:36.680 --> 49:38.920
is by subscribing to our Twitch page.

49:38.920 --> 49:39.920
Hey, there he is.

49:39.920 --> 49:40.800
You go over there somehow.

49:40.800 --> 49:41.600
I don't know.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.400
I don't even know what Twitch calls it.

49:43.400 --> 49:44.560
Do you twatch over there?

49:44.560 --> 49:46.760
You go over there and you twatch to our channel.

49:46.760 --> 49:49.600
We need you, dear audience, to go find out and then report back

49:49.600 --> 49:50.920
whatever the terminology is.

49:50.920 --> 49:51.920
And if you ever looked at the title

49:51.920 --> 49:54.600
and been like, I like that title of an episode,

49:54.600 --> 49:56.640
or you look at the title and go, that title sucks,

49:56.640 --> 49:59.240
it's your fault, literally your fault.

49:59.240 --> 50:01.560
Yes, you, because you didn't show up live and submit

50:01.560 --> 50:03.360
a better one, because when people are live,

50:03.360 --> 50:05.020
they can bang suggest a title.

50:05.020 --> 50:06.600
That's exclamation mark and suggest it.

50:06.600 --> 50:07.600
Get it together, Steve.

50:07.600 --> 50:08.360
We need your help.

50:08.360 --> 50:09.480
That's right.

50:09.480 --> 50:09.960
I know.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.280
We were saying that.

50:11.280 --> 50:13.720
And they showed up on Sunday and they title suggest,

50:13.720 --> 50:14.840
and then we vote on it.

50:14.840 --> 50:16.160
See you next week.

50:16.160 --> 50:18.320
Same bad time, same bad station.

50:18.320 --> 50:20.160
In the meantime, you can just subscribe and get

50:20.160 --> 50:21.280
the show when we release it, not have

50:21.280 --> 50:22.560
to worry about any of that BS.

50:22.560 --> 50:25.560
You just go to linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe.

50:25.560 --> 50:28.920
Hey, if you would, leave us a review in your podcast app

50:28.920 --> 50:29.840
of choice.

50:29.840 --> 50:32.080
If it's the Apple Podcast, you know,

50:32.080 --> 50:34.800
we got like 20% of you now on the Apple Podcast.

50:34.800 --> 50:37.480
Have you given us a review recently?

50:37.480 --> 50:38.840
Wouldn't it be nice?

50:38.840 --> 50:39.720
I think so.

50:39.720 --> 50:41.280
I think it'd be real nice.

50:41.280 --> 50:42.120
That'd be real great.

50:42.120 --> 50:45.000
Or tell a friend, tell a friend that's also great.

50:45.000 --> 50:46.760
Or become a member for the whole network

50:46.760 --> 50:49.040
and support us financially at jupyter.party.

50:49.040 --> 50:50.960
There's a lot going on.

50:50.960 --> 50:53.240
Things are shifting, so we appreciate you being there

50:53.240 --> 50:55.000
and coming along for the ride.

50:55.000 --> 50:55.840
It's a new frontier.

50:55.840 --> 50:57.720
And I'll see you right back here next Sunday.

50:57.720 --> 51:12.520
See you then.

51:27.720 --> 51:39.880
All right, let's title this thing JBtitles.com, JBtitles.

51:39.880 --> 51:44.080
You know, one of the apps that I had a lot of fun with on Umbral was, well, you know,

51:44.080 --> 51:45.880
I had to install a bunch of them just for fun.

51:45.880 --> 51:49.280
But there's one called Mempool, Chris, if you play with this one.

51:49.280 --> 51:51.560
Super cool way to visualize what's going on on the blockchain.

51:51.560 --> 51:52.560
Yeah.

51:52.560 --> 51:57.320
Yeah, I ended up just kind of watching because it lists transactions as they're coming through

51:57.320 --> 52:03.520
and I ended up just kind of like watching it as you might a bonfire or I don't know.

52:03.520 --> 52:04.840
It was it was really neat.

52:04.840 --> 52:10.480
And I saw a transaction come through that was wild, Chris.

52:10.480 --> 52:14.320
It was twenty eight thousand five hundred Bitcoin.

52:14.320 --> 52:15.320
Whoa.

52:15.320 --> 52:16.320
Whoa.

52:16.320 --> 52:17.320
OK.

52:17.320 --> 52:18.320
Let's OK.

52:18.320 --> 52:19.320
Let's do the math on that.

52:19.320 --> 52:20.320
Twenty eight thousand five hundred BTC.

52:20.320 --> 52:24.920
You're saying BTC in USD is what that is in USD is not.

52:24.920 --> 52:25.920
Can I type that into Google?

52:25.920 --> 52:27.520
I feel like I should be able to type that into Google.

52:27.520 --> 52:31.960
I tried to do it with DuckDuckGo before and it didn't it didn't work.

52:31.960 --> 52:32.960
I was really.

52:32.960 --> 52:33.960
DuckDuckGo doesn't do it.

52:33.960 --> 52:34.960
That seems like obvious.

52:34.960 --> 52:35.960
I know.

52:35.960 --> 52:36.960
I know.

52:36.960 --> 52:37.960
No way.

52:37.960 --> 52:38.960
No way.

52:38.960 --> 52:39.960
All right.

52:39.960 --> 52:40.960
Well, anyways, I got a converter.

52:40.960 --> 52:41.960
I got a calculator here.

52:41.960 --> 52:42.960
I can do that.

52:42.960 --> 52:43.960
But that just seems obvious.

52:43.960 --> 52:44.960
So they should have that built in.

52:44.960 --> 52:45.960
Right.

52:45.960 --> 52:46.960
Now, well, Chris remembers how to do math.

52:46.960 --> 52:47.960
JBtitles.com everyone.

52:47.960 --> 52:48.960
Oh, yeah.

52:48.960 --> 52:49.960
There you go.

52:49.960 --> 52:50.960
So is that.

52:50.960 --> 52:53.120
Boy, that's a lot of numbers.

52:53.120 --> 52:57.240
I don't even know because it just gives me a here, you know, numbers are hard.

52:57.240 --> 52:59.180
So here's the number in USD.

52:59.180 --> 53:02.760
That's the oh, here we go.

53:02.760 --> 53:03.760
What is that?

53:03.760 --> 53:04.760
Is that one hundred and six million?

53:04.760 --> 53:05.760
Is that what that is?

53:05.760 --> 53:06.760
Got to put some commas in here.

53:06.760 --> 53:07.760
I know.

53:07.760 --> 53:08.760
That's the problem.

53:08.760 --> 53:10.480
So I put commas in.

53:10.480 --> 53:14.000
So we got one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.360
I'm seeing one point one billion.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.920
That was one transaction that I saw come across.

53:18.920 --> 53:20.880
OK, that makes sense.

53:20.880 --> 53:21.880
That makes sense.

53:21.880 --> 53:22.880
No, one point one.

53:22.880 --> 53:23.880
One point one billion.

53:23.880 --> 53:24.880
Yeah.

53:24.880 --> 53:25.880
Rounding up.

53:25.880 --> 53:26.880
Yeah.

53:26.880 --> 53:27.880
That makes sense.

53:27.880 --> 53:28.880
Isn't it ten billion?

53:28.880 --> 53:29.880
We're all good at math, right?

53:29.880 --> 53:30.880
I thought Google did this.

53:30.880 --> 53:33.960
If you're using DuckDuckGo, use bang WA.

53:33.960 --> 53:34.960
What's bang WA?

53:34.960 --> 53:35.960
Wolfram Alpha.

53:35.960 --> 53:36.960
No.

53:36.960 --> 53:37.960
Bren was.

53:37.960 --> 53:38.960
Bren was right.

53:38.960 --> 53:39.960
Oh.

53:39.960 --> 53:40.960
Bang WA, huh?

53:40.960 --> 53:41.960
All right.

53:41.960 --> 53:46.480
I love, ironically, searching Google for DuckDuckGo just so that I hope somewhere.

53:46.480 --> 53:49.480
I hope somewhere at Google they have a metric of how many people are searching for Bing

53:49.480 --> 53:50.480
and DuckDuckGo.

53:50.480 --> 53:51.480
All right.

53:51.480 --> 53:52.480
So.

53:52.480 --> 53:53.480
All right.

53:53.480 --> 53:54.480
I will try it with Wolfram Alpha.

53:54.480 --> 53:55.480
Wolfram, if I can say it.

53:55.480 --> 53:56.480
Yeah.

53:56.480 --> 54:00.160
You know, there's definitely a Grafana dashboard for searching for Google or searching for

54:00.160 --> 54:01.160
DuckDuckGo in there.

54:01.160 --> 54:02.160
That would please me.

54:02.160 --> 54:05.000
You know, just a little insecurity of it all would please me.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
OK.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
They did it.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
Yep.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.000
It's one point one billion, according to the Wolf.

54:09.000 --> 54:14.280
That was one transaction I saw kind of speed past the screen in a small flash along with

54:14.280 --> 54:15.280
a bunch of other transactions.

54:15.280 --> 54:16.280
Yeah.

54:16.280 --> 54:21.960
And it was just like really landed at home, like what is happening on the network?

54:21.960 --> 54:23.240
Some serious money.

54:23.240 --> 54:24.360
Oh, yeah.

54:24.360 --> 54:28.020
If you think that's one transaction between, I don't know, two wallets or so, what else

54:28.020 --> 54:29.280
is happening that I'm not seeing?

54:29.280 --> 54:30.280
It's wild.

54:30.280 --> 54:31.780
It's all there.

54:31.780 --> 54:33.200
It's all open.

54:33.200 --> 54:52.360
Anyone can see it.
