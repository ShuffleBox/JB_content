00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
I can't believe I'm saying this,

00:02.080 --> 00:03.920
but I've switched away from systemd.

00:03.920 --> 00:04.920
What?

00:04.920 --> 00:05.880
I don't believe it.

00:05.880 --> 00:07.080
I'm just kidding.

00:07.080 --> 00:18.080
Hello friends, and welcome into a very special Linux Unplugged.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.920
This is episode 314.

00:19.920 --> 00:20.920
My name is Chris.

00:20.920 --> 00:21.920
My name is Wes.

00:21.920 --> 00:22.920
Hello, Wes.

00:22.920 --> 00:23.920
Hello.

00:23.920 --> 00:24.920
How are you doing?

00:24.920 --> 00:25.920
I'm doing great, because we've got a full house today.

00:25.920 --> 00:26.920
We do.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.760
It's a special week here at the Jupiter Broadcasting Studios.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.960
We have the full core team in-house.

00:32.960 --> 00:36.200
And I guess that's my quick way of saying people that are all involved in creating a

00:36.200 --> 00:40.180
brand new podcast for the network are in-house this week.

00:40.180 --> 00:44.640
And that means that we have a whole cast of characters here helping us get various jobs

00:44.640 --> 00:45.640
done.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.880
So I want to say a very happy hello to Mr. Cheese Bacon.

00:48.880 --> 00:49.880
Hello Cheezy.

00:49.880 --> 00:50.880
Hello.

00:50.880 --> 00:51.880
Hello.

00:51.880 --> 00:52.880
Hello.

00:52.880 --> 00:53.880
Good to have you here.

00:53.880 --> 00:54.880
Thank you.

00:54.880 --> 00:55.880
It's good to have everyone here.

00:55.880 --> 00:56.880
And hello to Alex.

00:56.880 --> 00:57.880
Nice to have you in studio, Alex.

00:57.880 --> 00:58.880
Howdy, y'all.

00:58.880 --> 00:59.880
Nice to have you.

00:59.880 --> 01:00.880
You're sounding good, sir.

01:00.880 --> 01:01.880
You're sounding...

01:01.880 --> 01:02.880
That sounded nearly real.

01:02.880 --> 01:03.880
Thank you.

01:03.880 --> 01:04.880
Nearly.

01:04.880 --> 01:05.880
Nearly.

01:05.880 --> 01:06.880
And it's always good to have Brent back in studio.

01:06.880 --> 01:07.880
Hello, Brent.

01:07.880 --> 01:08.880
Well, hello, everyone.

01:08.880 --> 01:09.880
How are you doing?

01:09.880 --> 01:10.880
I'm great.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.440
It's good to be connected via real, like, cords and stuff to the studio.

01:13.440 --> 01:14.440
That's nice.

01:14.440 --> 01:15.440
Brent made me breakfast.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.440
What?

01:16.440 --> 01:17.440
Mm-hmm.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.440
Brent made me breakfast today.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.440
He's such a gentleman.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.440
It's so good.

01:20.440 --> 01:21.440
And Drew barbecued lunch.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.440
So...

01:22.440 --> 01:23.440
Pays to have the team around.

01:23.440 --> 01:26.280
Now, of course, this wouldn't be a Linux Unplugged without our virtual log.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.280
Time-appropriate greetings there, Mumble Room.

01:28.280 --> 01:29.280
Hello.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.280
Hello.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.280
Hello.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.280
Hello.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.280
It's really good to...

01:33.280 --> 01:34.280
Aloha.

01:34.280 --> 01:35.280
Aloha, Neil.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.280
Aloha.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.280
Welcome back.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.280
Neil will be giving us his flock report in a moment.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.800
But, Emma, I just have to say, it's super great to see you back.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.800
How are you doing?

01:41.800 --> 01:42.800
I'm doing good.

01:42.800 --> 01:48.720
I will be off crutches pretty soon, but I returned to System 76, I've returned to the

01:48.720 --> 01:49.720
factory.

01:49.720 --> 01:52.480
So I'm moving around pretty good these days.

01:52.480 --> 01:56.560
Man, if people don't follow Emma, social happiness on Twitter.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.640
She recently had a serious medical situation.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.960
Just, I mean, unbelievable to watch from afar, Emma.

02:00.960 --> 02:01.960
So...

02:01.960 --> 02:04.860
It was a safari accident, to be specific.

02:04.860 --> 02:06.280
That is very cool.

02:06.280 --> 02:11.040
We should make that a disclaimer because, you know, other people get injured, but Emma

02:11.040 --> 02:12.220
got injured on a safari.

02:12.220 --> 02:13.520
So that's true.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.520
But it's really good to see you back.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.080
I've been following your journey on Twitter.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.400
Nice to see you back at work.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.680
We have some cool stuff you and I are going to be talking about in a little bit today

02:20.680 --> 02:21.680
too.

02:21.680 --> 02:22.680
So I'm glad you're here.

02:22.680 --> 02:26.640
Let's kick things off with a wee bit of community news.

02:26.640 --> 02:31.920
Did you see all of this hoopla around this horrible bug that was discovered in KDE that

02:31.920 --> 02:34.800
could potentially make it vulnerable to attack?

02:34.800 --> 02:40.280
And then the KDE project responded by just ripping the feature out of Plasma, I understand.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.280
What happened last?

02:41.280 --> 02:42.280
Yeah.

02:42.280 --> 02:45.220
So it's not, you can call it a bug or really it's a design decision because it turns out

02:45.220 --> 02:48.600
you can execute scripts in your.desktop or.directory files.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.480
And why would you want to do that?

02:50.480 --> 02:54.160
You know, the funny part is when they removed the functionality to do that, the words accompanying

02:54.160 --> 02:56.320
the removal were, we didn't really have a use case.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.320
But you can imagine, right?

02:57.320 --> 02:59.240
It's just like a little hook you can run.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.240
You can have a script.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.360
Run a script to set up an environment ahead of time.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.440
I mean, I could kind of-

03:02.440 --> 03:04.080
I've never wanted to.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.080
Yeah.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.080
Yeah.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.080
So that's funny.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.080
So they just ripped it out.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.080
Yeah.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.080
You know, there was a little kerfuffle here.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.080
Defcon was going on.

03:11.080 --> 03:15.960
So the researcher disclosed it in a way that the KDE project was not too pleased about

03:15.960 --> 03:18.840
because it just showed up on Twitter.

03:18.840 --> 03:23.000
And the researcher actually sort of stated that, well, Defcon was coming up and I just

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
wanted to get this out there.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.760
Man, that shit really pisses me off.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.280
The one thing is when you're doing this is be responsible.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.420
Be responsible and work with the project.

03:31.420 --> 03:37.920
And going on Twitter just to build your personal brand has got to be one of the worst human

03:37.920 --> 03:43.000
being things to do because not only do you make a project look a little foolish because

03:43.000 --> 03:46.720
you don't give them the opportunity to work with a heads up that just about everybody

03:46.720 --> 03:51.480
else gets, but you're putting real users at risk to make yourself look good.

03:51.480 --> 03:52.480
Yeah.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.480
There's just no point.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.480
I mean-

03:54.480 --> 03:55.480
It's disgusting.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.480
We could have got this solved and pushed out before anyone knew.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.460
Now, I doubt that this was being abused in the wild.

03:59.460 --> 04:02.400
It's not a super important vulnerability, but still-

04:02.400 --> 04:03.620
How do you think I have good form?

04:03.620 --> 04:05.880
How do you think I got that key logger on your laptop?

04:05.880 --> 04:06.880
What?

04:06.880 --> 04:07.880
Yeah.

04:07.880 --> 04:08.880
Dang it.

04:08.880 --> 04:09.880
Yeah.

04:09.880 --> 04:10.880
We'll have links though.

04:10.880 --> 04:11.880
You can go read the...

04:11.880 --> 04:14.420
There is a little white paper about the vulnerability and you can go see that, well, that feature,

04:14.420 --> 04:15.420
it's gone.

04:15.420 --> 04:23.320
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we have perhaps the first modern core boot server platform.

04:23.320 --> 04:28.840
Supermicro's X11 SSH TF, I love the name because it's got SSH in it, is a platform

04:28.840 --> 04:30.820
that supports core boot.

04:30.820 --> 04:35.480
This platform is the first modern upstream core boot server platform on the market with

04:35.480 --> 04:43.040
an Intel Xeon E3 1200 V6 processor, which commonly known as the Kaby Lake DT.

04:43.040 --> 04:48.780
Now, Wes, you did a little sleuthing into why Supermicro would be interested in doing

04:48.780 --> 04:52.000
this and what the motivations are behind this development.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.600
It kind of checks out, kind of makes sense.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.600
Right.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.560
So this was over at the Nine ESEC site.

04:57.560 --> 05:02.040
They've worked with Moldat, which is a VPN provider, and it's all part of the system

05:02.040 --> 05:04.480
transparency project.

05:04.480 --> 05:08.940
And basically the idea is to get as much of this stuff open sourced and transparent as

05:08.940 --> 05:13.200
you can, especially if you're interested as they are as a VPN provider of being able to

05:13.200 --> 05:15.880
guarantee things to their customers about how their systems run.

05:15.880 --> 05:20.040
And it's all well and good to have an OS that has audit logs and shows that you're not keeping

05:20.040 --> 05:22.320
other logs or exactly what you are keeping.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.980
But when you can't trust the firmware, you can't trust anything else.

05:25.980 --> 05:27.140
So true.

05:27.140 --> 05:32.840
You can see from a marketing standpoint, this is a great thing to have on your site, fully

05:32.840 --> 05:38.760
audible platform from the VPN software all the way down to the core boot hardware of

05:38.760 --> 05:39.760
this system.

05:39.760 --> 05:44.560
And, I mean, as you've seen, if you've ever tried to use core boot, most of the time anything

05:44.560 --> 05:46.480
that supports it is way out of date.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.440
But that's just not going to work if you're trying to run a business.

05:48.440 --> 05:53.920
Speaking of core boot, our friends over at System76 and Emma have a little news around

05:53.920 --> 05:54.920
core boot.

05:54.920 --> 05:59.920
It appears System76 are preparing to roll out their first core boot enabled laptop,

05:59.920 --> 06:03.800
which is, I think this news is coming out just ahead of this year's open source firmware

06:03.800 --> 06:04.800
conference.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.520
I bet those two things are not unrelated, Emma.

06:07.520 --> 06:08.920
It is exciting.

06:08.920 --> 06:14.360
And people that pre-order with the open firmware will get to pick up their daughters at the

06:14.360 --> 06:15.360
conference.

06:15.360 --> 06:16.360
Whoa.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.360
Cool.

06:17.360 --> 06:20.780
What kind of work has this taken behind the scenes to make this possible?

06:20.780 --> 06:25.960
Is there like some sort of a crazy mad scientist lab where people are hacking away on firmwares?

06:25.960 --> 06:28.760
Has there been some sort of collaboration with another group?

06:28.760 --> 06:31.240
What has been the engineering side of this?

06:31.240 --> 06:36.280
This has been in-house led by our lead engineer, Jeremy.

06:36.280 --> 06:42.480
He's very big into open firmware and developing in Rust.

06:42.480 --> 06:45.880
And he's been putting it on all the laptops.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.120
They've taken them apart if needed.

06:48.120 --> 06:53.280
They've had to work with Thunderbolt to get proper licensing to include in our core boot.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.600
We've had to work on suspend issues.

06:56.600 --> 07:02.040
Right now, the Darter and the Gazelle both are doing pretty good supporting core boot

07:02.040 --> 07:03.120
fully.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.000
So it's these two systems.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.200
Is it possible for existing purchasers, like people who have a Darter that maybe they got

07:10.200 --> 07:11.200
it six months ago?

07:11.200 --> 07:14.400
Would it be possible for them to switch over to core boot and Linux boot?

07:14.400 --> 07:16.440
Or is this only going to be the new systems?

07:16.440 --> 07:20.760
This should be anyone that currently has a Darter should be able to do it.

07:20.760 --> 07:25.920
And I'm guessing we'll have people reaching out in support if they want to implement that

07:25.920 --> 07:29.320
or test it out, and we'll be happy to give them instructions.

07:29.320 --> 07:32.400
So what's the sales pitch now?

07:32.400 --> 07:34.560
Is it user security and privacy?

07:34.560 --> 07:38.600
How does System76 look at this?

07:38.600 --> 07:40.480
What is the value this adds to the product?

07:40.480 --> 07:44.500
Well, we want to make sure the entire product is open.

07:44.500 --> 07:50.800
So this puts us a step closer to that, moving away from as much proprietary software as

07:50.800 --> 07:52.400
we can.

07:52.400 --> 07:59.480
And this also lets us get to the lowest level of the hardware so we can maximize performance

07:59.480 --> 08:02.640
and just tailor the performance towards the user's needs.

08:02.640 --> 08:12.360
I also noticed the brand new shiny 4K OLED display at our workstation was announced.

08:12.360 --> 08:19.920
And this thing is such a monster that we were speculating last week about what its capabilities

08:19.920 --> 08:20.920
were.

08:20.920 --> 08:24.400
And sure enough, you guys said, well, why don't we send you out a test rig?

08:24.400 --> 08:29.160
So in a couple of weeks, in a few weeks, we may have a review here of the new Adder workstation.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.160
What's your take on this new one?

08:30.160 --> 08:31.960
I bet you must be pretty impressed.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.040
You've seen a lot of laptops come out the doors there.

08:34.040 --> 08:42.480
But this one's 4K OLED, RTX 2070 graphics, 8-core Intel i9, 64 gigs of RAM in a laptop?

08:42.480 --> 08:44.880
Yeah, she's a beauty.

08:44.880 --> 08:49.760
If anyone picks her up, I'm guessing if you're a laptop namer, it's going to have some sexy

08:49.760 --> 08:50.760
woman name.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.760
Yeah, it seems like a lady with that display.

08:52.760 --> 08:53.760
Beautiful eyes, you know.

08:53.760 --> 08:54.760
It's beautiful eyes.

08:54.760 --> 08:55.760
Yeah.

08:55.760 --> 09:00.160
The contrast ratio is actually 100,000 to one.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.160
Oh.

09:01.160 --> 09:03.080
So the contrast is pretty extreme.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.620
And it also has the nits.

09:05.620 --> 09:06.760
It's 400 nits.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.560
So it's pretty bright as well.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.560
That sounds wonderful.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.000
I think we've all been waiting for a laptop like that.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.280
I have a couple of different use cases.

09:13.280 --> 09:18.160
I want to bring it in in-house and see how it processes the drone footage because that's

09:18.160 --> 09:21.300
brought just about every machine down to its knees.

09:21.300 --> 09:25.720
And then set it up as a VM machine, maybe attempt to do some PCI pass-through with it.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.200
When you're talking specs like this.

09:27.200 --> 09:32.040
Yeah, we haven't tried the GPU pass-through yet, but that is on the slate for this week

09:32.040 --> 09:33.040
for sure.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.040
Oh.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.040
Well, I'll let you know.

09:35.040 --> 09:39.000
Yeah, definitely one of the things I would like to test it out and kind of run it through

09:39.000 --> 09:44.720
its paces would be just rendering out video, Blender work, that sort of stuff.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.560
And I mean, they depict it here on the actual landing page for the site.

09:47.560 --> 09:52.680
So with that 2070 in there, you should really be able in the 4K display, you should really

09:52.680 --> 09:57.560
be able to get some high quality graphic and design work done off of this machine.

09:57.560 --> 10:01.040
This also be like one of my first longer term hands-on with a Pop!

10:01.040 --> 10:02.040
OS.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.040
Right.

10:03.040 --> 10:04.040
Looking forward.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.040
I've been waiting.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.800
And then the last thing that I know, I've been looking at the specs of this machine.

10:08.800 --> 10:14.520
The one thing that I really like so far just from the outset is a lot of the big bulky

10:14.520 --> 10:20.000
ports are on the back of the laptop, the power, the Ethernet, the HDMI, the DisplayPort, a

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
USB-A, NC.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.640
That works so well when you're just setting it up on a mobile desk.

10:23.640 --> 10:24.640
It's so clean.

10:24.640 --> 10:25.640
Yeah.

10:25.640 --> 10:26.860
So I'm really looking forward to it, Emma.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.580
And I'm really glad you're able to make it back and chat with us about the news.

10:29.580 --> 10:31.580
It's great to see the core boot systems.

10:31.580 --> 10:37.020
So what's kind of the timeline for that to be just the default when people order one

10:37.020 --> 10:38.100
of those machines?

10:38.100 --> 10:40.280
I don't have information on that yet.

10:40.280 --> 10:44.220
It's really hard to predict with Nvidia models.

10:44.220 --> 10:48.600
It's an ongoing project, but I do need to mention one other thing.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.580
The Adder is currently on sale for about another month.

10:52.580 --> 10:56.520
So if anyone is interested, we do have a 30-day return period.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.240
So now is the right time to purchase one.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.240
Okay.

11:00.240 --> 11:04.520
Also kind of just saw this slip through the news, but it's probably worth mentioning too,

11:04.520 --> 11:08.020
is that it looks like System76 has been granted a Thunderbolt license.

11:08.020 --> 11:09.020
That seems huge.

11:09.020 --> 11:10.020
Yeah.

11:10.020 --> 11:15.520
We're the core boot, so we can implement Thunderbolt functionality and core boot systems.

11:15.520 --> 11:16.520
That's fantastic.

11:16.520 --> 11:17.980
That was one of the lingering questions I had.

11:17.980 --> 11:19.260
That's great to see.

11:19.260 --> 11:21.900
Well, Emma, that looks like an awesome release.

11:21.900 --> 11:26.260
I can't wait to try it out and kick the tires and see if I can't make it suffer a little

11:26.260 --> 11:27.260
bit.

11:27.260 --> 11:28.260
Awesome.

11:28.260 --> 11:30.260
Well, we look forward to seeing what you think.

11:30.260 --> 11:35.300
Well, Emma, do keep checking in as you're feeling well and joining us because it's good

11:35.300 --> 11:36.300
to hear from you.

11:36.300 --> 11:37.300
We love to have you.

11:37.300 --> 11:38.300
Will do.

11:38.300 --> 11:39.300
Miss you guys.

11:39.300 --> 11:40.860
Glad to see you back.

11:40.860 --> 11:43.920
All right.

11:43.920 --> 11:48.520
Just a couple of items in the old housekeeping this week.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.140
This Friday stream will be the final Friday stream.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.140
Say it ain't so.

11:52.140 --> 11:57.860
As we say goodbye to a crazy experiment that will result in a couple of new things that

11:57.860 --> 11:58.900
we're doing.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.480
So we looked at the Friday stream and said, how could we do this a little differently?

12:01.480 --> 12:03.060
We decided to break it up a little bit.

12:03.060 --> 12:05.500
We'll have more information about that soon.

12:05.500 --> 12:10.300
Live stream, community Q&A's, things like that, that'll be coming down the pipe.

12:10.300 --> 12:15.460
But the first takeaway is come see us on Friday because we have the crew in house this Friday.

12:15.460 --> 12:18.580
If you're listening the week this came out, we'll also release it, of course, over at

12:18.580 --> 12:19.580
Fridaystream.com.

12:19.580 --> 12:23.540
It's going to just be a fun show with the crew in house hanging out and we're launching

12:23.540 --> 12:25.380
a brand new feed.

12:25.380 --> 12:33.020
We'll tell you all about this later on, but you can find it over at extras.show, extras.show.

12:33.020 --> 12:37.660
All kinds of stuff we'll be ending up in, stuff that maybe didn't fit in here, an interview

12:37.660 --> 12:43.820
here and there, a random minimum viable podcast we're trying, extra content perhaps from today's

12:43.820 --> 12:46.500
episode of Linux Unplugged, things like that.

12:46.500 --> 12:50.460
That complete keynote from Thomas Cameron from a couple of weeks back, that's in the

12:50.460 --> 12:51.460
extras feed.

12:51.460 --> 12:56.260
So we've created a new feed of extra content that doesn't quite fit in the other shows,

12:56.260 --> 12:58.860
but we wanted something that you could subscribe to and just get it easily.

12:58.860 --> 12:59.860
Right.

12:59.860 --> 13:02.220
I mean, you know when you run out of JB shows, you're already caught up on everything for

13:02.220 --> 13:03.220
the week.

13:03.220 --> 13:04.220
What are you going to do?

13:04.220 --> 13:05.220
Now we've got a feed for you.

13:05.220 --> 13:06.220
We don't want you to get the shakes.

13:06.220 --> 13:09.980
Extras.show, that's with an S, extras.show, and it's extras.show slash subscribe.

13:09.980 --> 13:15.020
It's just going to be fun, quick stuff in there that gives us an excuse to kind of play

13:15.020 --> 13:19.220
around sometimes, including some stuff that we'll do on the live stream with the community

13:19.220 --> 13:20.500
very soon.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.900
So we'll tell you all about that.

13:22.900 --> 13:28.460
And a nice, nice bit of news on the Linux Academy core side, transcripts are nearly at

13:28.460 --> 13:30.060
100% now.

13:30.060 --> 13:33.900
These are click along transcripts that make it easy to jump around in the video.

13:33.900 --> 13:38.080
And there's a whole new batch of free courses that are available for community members.

13:38.080 --> 13:43.300
If you sign up for Linux Academy community, including some cloud fundamentals, AWS security

13:43.300 --> 13:50.740
essentials, and Kali deep dive, that's worth going, making the free account just for that

13:50.740 --> 13:51.740
right there.

13:51.740 --> 13:52.740
Tell you what.

13:52.740 --> 13:53.740
So check that out.

13:53.740 --> 13:54.740
That's all over at linuxacademy.com.

13:54.740 --> 13:59.980
You can sign up, get a free community account L right here, and our team curates that stuff.

13:59.980 --> 14:04.020
So that's why we mention it from time to time, because it's a good deal.

14:04.020 --> 14:05.900
So go check that out, won't you?

14:05.900 --> 14:06.900
And much, much more.

14:06.900 --> 14:10.980
And keep your ears out on that extras feed, because there'll be a lot of cool stuff coming

14:10.980 --> 14:18.580
down that feed, extras.show slash subscribe for that feed.

14:18.580 --> 14:25.580
Now Mr. Payne, there is a problem out there, and it's getting bigger and bigger by the

14:25.580 --> 14:26.580
day.

14:26.580 --> 14:27.580
It's the only way against, yeah.

14:27.580 --> 14:28.580
Yeah.

14:28.580 --> 14:30.860
Otherwise, Linux would probably be dead.

14:30.860 --> 14:35.500
We'd probably be in a world of hurt, and a bunch of different communities are trying

14:35.500 --> 14:39.140
to solve this big problem that everyone listening to this show knows about, and that's the kernel

14:39.140 --> 14:40.500
is a huge project.

14:40.500 --> 14:44.020
It grows in size and contributors every single month.

14:44.020 --> 14:48.660
On average, most releases have somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 developers making contributions.

14:48.660 --> 14:50.580
Yeah, that's Major Hayden.

14:50.580 --> 14:53.420
He's a principal software engineer at Red Hat.

14:53.420 --> 14:56.140
And something on the order of 200 to 300 of those are brand new.

14:56.140 --> 14:59.540
They've never made a contribution to the kernel before.

14:59.540 --> 15:02.260
He's going to be joining us in just a moment.

15:02.260 --> 15:08.300
And he's going to talk about a big project they're working on to try to solve this issue.

15:08.300 --> 15:12.020
Major's here to give us some background on this, and it's the continuous integration

15:12.020 --> 15:13.020
project.

15:13.020 --> 15:17.580
It's a really cool idea to kind of try to catch the low-hanging fruit with how fast

15:17.580 --> 15:19.140
the Linux kernel is moving.

15:19.140 --> 15:23.300
There are some challenges there, and I would say Greg Crow Hartman's got a couple of really

15:23.300 --> 15:26.380
good talks on this particular topic.

15:26.380 --> 15:31.540
One of the challenges, I guess the biggest challenge, is that it moves incredibly fast.

15:31.540 --> 15:35.020
The project is large and moves fast.

15:35.020 --> 15:38.700
Last I looked, it was the fastest moving open source project that was out there by a good

15:38.700 --> 15:40.940
amount, even way past Kubernetes.

15:40.940 --> 15:45.540
I think it does, if you take all the commits that have gone into Kubernetes, that's about

15:45.540 --> 15:47.340
two and a half versions of kernel development.

15:47.340 --> 15:49.340
So that's about two and a half releases worth.

15:49.340 --> 15:50.340
So we're talking fast.

15:50.340 --> 15:55.780
Yeah, and so their idea here is, let's come up with something that can monitor this and

15:55.780 --> 15:58.780
send it out across multiple systems, architectures.

15:58.780 --> 15:59.780
Right.

15:59.780 --> 16:02.060
I mean, that's just a wide test base.

16:02.060 --> 16:05.540
The Linux kernel runs everywhere, as we say all the time, and that means you got to test

16:05.540 --> 16:06.540
it everywhere.

16:06.540 --> 16:08.980
And you have tons of different options when you're building it.

16:08.980 --> 16:09.980
Yeah.

16:09.980 --> 16:10.980
Can you imagine doing this by hand?

16:10.980 --> 16:11.980
All right.

16:11.980 --> 16:12.980
I make a couple of changes.

16:12.980 --> 16:13.980
I'm going to go compile that kernel.

16:13.980 --> 16:15.860
I'm going to go distribute it on like six different machines and architectures that

16:15.860 --> 16:18.980
I have to keep in my office to test this, and then I'm going to test it.

16:18.980 --> 16:24.180
Come back, wait, see if anything's changed, and then repeat over and over and over again.

16:24.180 --> 16:30.420
That statistic, the Kubernetes entire product is two and a half kernel versions.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.420
Yeah.

16:31.420 --> 16:32.420
That's amazing.

16:32.420 --> 16:33.420
Yeah.

16:33.420 --> 16:35.700
And you think of Kubernetes as this massive project, right?

16:35.700 --> 16:39.300
Yeah, there was just that review done of it this week, some security thing, and it took

16:39.300 --> 16:40.300
them months.

16:40.300 --> 16:45.700
Yeah, and then you have new contributors, you have subsystems that are on esoteric hardware.

16:45.700 --> 16:46.900
It's really a challenge.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.100
That's where this continuous integration project comes in.

16:49.100 --> 16:56.460
This project came about because there's a lot of low-hanging fruit in the kernel that

16:56.460 --> 16:58.900
can easily be tested.

16:58.900 --> 17:04.020
There's quite a few things that you can test in a VM or you can test on a physical host,

17:04.020 --> 17:08.980
let's say, that are very easy to test internally with just that one machine.

17:08.980 --> 17:13.300
And so the question was asked, why don't we make automation that just runs these tests

17:13.300 --> 17:15.220
to catch the low-hanging fruit?

17:15.220 --> 17:19.180
Because the idea is we want to take Red Hat kernel developers and not have them go deal

17:19.180 --> 17:24.820
with these small, easy-to-fix problems that slow them down and make them have to go find

17:24.820 --> 17:25.820
a solution.

17:25.820 --> 17:29.220
But instead, let's catch these problems before the patch gets merged in the first place.

17:29.220 --> 17:34.400
So if someone says, hey, I'm bringing in these 10 patches, and then we find that when they

17:34.400 --> 17:39.620
do that, all of a sudden memory allocation issues pop up, like you can't allocate memory

17:39.620 --> 17:44.660
like you could before, or it's just not structured in the way that you want to, then you can

17:44.660 --> 17:45.660
call it out.

17:45.660 --> 17:48.220
Someone could say, oh, there's a bug in there.

17:48.220 --> 17:51.460
The nice thing about that is you can find the bug right then when the patch is being

17:51.460 --> 17:57.220
proposed instead of later on when quality engineering is taking a look at a lot of changes,

17:57.220 --> 18:01.260
not just the kernel, but a whole lot of things that are changing and trying to work backwards

18:01.260 --> 18:03.460
and figure out where the problem was.

18:03.460 --> 18:07.620
In our chat with Major, one of the things that he pointed out was that, okay, we can

18:07.620 --> 18:12.820
solve this from a technology standpoint, but there's the human factor as well.

18:12.820 --> 18:16.420
And there's a couple of different projects, but the one that the continuous integration

18:16.420 --> 18:22.100
project is working with to solve for the human factor is called, was it patchwork, Wes?

18:22.100 --> 18:23.100
Yeah, patchwork.

18:23.100 --> 18:27.540
I mean, if you think about it, Linux kernel development is done in its own style.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.580
It's kind of an older style.

18:28.580 --> 18:29.980
You're on the mailing list.

18:29.980 --> 18:34.300
And while, of course, there are Git mirrors everywhere, it's kind of secondary.

18:34.300 --> 18:37.660
So you need to get the culture, understand how to interact with that, and you need a

18:37.660 --> 18:39.740
bridge to actually help the tooling work.

18:39.740 --> 18:42.660
There's a few software projects out that help with that.

18:42.660 --> 18:48.700
There's a big one called patchwork, and it essentially reads through a mailing list and

18:48.700 --> 18:53.220
watches the emails as they come in and tries to figure out which of these patches go together.

18:53.220 --> 18:58.940
So a kernel developer might submit a patch and say, okay, I want to change the way this

18:58.940 --> 18:59.940
works.

18:59.940 --> 19:02.340
It takes 10 patches to make this change.

19:02.340 --> 19:04.780
And so they submit all 10 patches to the mailing list.

19:04.780 --> 19:08.020
And then what patchwork will do is go and say, okay, wait a minute.

19:08.020 --> 19:10.340
This was one contribution from one developer.

19:10.340 --> 19:11.460
It has 10 pieces.

19:11.460 --> 19:13.180
These go together.

19:13.180 --> 19:17.460
And so then inside the web interface, you can go and look at all these patches together

19:17.460 --> 19:18.460
in one place.

19:18.460 --> 19:20.140
And of course, there's an API as well.

19:20.140 --> 19:24.460
So if you have automation, you can actually just pull down the patches or what we call

19:24.460 --> 19:29.340
a patch series when patchwork sticks them together into one patch series.

19:29.340 --> 19:31.220
So that way you can test them.

19:31.220 --> 19:34.020
That way you can report back status on them and that kind of thing.

19:34.020 --> 19:38.420
But it's a software project completely over on the side from the mailing list.

19:38.420 --> 19:41.100
Now think about this for a moment.

19:41.100 --> 19:45.060
They thought they could replace all of this automated stuff.

19:45.060 --> 19:48.500
And they ended up running into this human problem where people have been doing it a

19:48.500 --> 19:51.380
certain way for a long time, have this that works for them.

19:51.380 --> 19:54.620
They got software that archives that it's plain text, it's searchable.

19:54.620 --> 19:57.340
They got filters set up that have been working for them for years.

19:57.340 --> 19:58.980
It's part of a workflow.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.740
And you can't deny the kernel is successful.

20:00.740 --> 20:02.020
So obviously it must work.

20:02.020 --> 20:03.020
Yeah.

20:03.020 --> 20:04.460
And I mean, you're not going to change that, right?

20:04.460 --> 20:06.160
I mean, that's established.

20:06.160 --> 20:09.580
So if you're going to build something to work with, that's your only option.

20:09.580 --> 20:14.460
Spark is an incredible effort to sort of solve a human problem and automate it at the same

20:14.460 --> 20:15.460
time.

20:15.460 --> 20:17.040
We'll have a link in the show notes if you want to know more about it.

20:17.040 --> 20:21.820
And if you'd like us to dig into those kinds of projects, go to linuxunplugged.com slash

20:21.820 --> 20:22.820
contact.

20:22.820 --> 20:25.680
If you'd like us to deep dive into some of that stuff, you definitely can.

20:25.680 --> 20:29.820
Now what's great is the way they're doing this, and even though it requires an incredible

20:29.820 --> 20:35.100
amount of infrastructure, they need system 390s, they need every various ARM system that's

20:35.100 --> 20:36.100
in production.

20:36.100 --> 20:39.480
They need lots of different Intel and AMD systems.

20:39.480 --> 20:43.180
The end result, hopefully, is improvements upstream.

20:43.180 --> 20:48.100
And so as part of this, we asked the question, well, if we do this really well, and we keep

20:48.100 --> 20:50.900
things from getting into the rail kernel that's not supposed to be there, what if we could

20:50.900 --> 20:52.500
do this for upstream?

20:52.500 --> 20:58.200
So what if we could do this for an upstream kernel repository of some sort, and not only

20:58.200 --> 21:03.780
be able to catch it earlier, but then catch it in a way such that we can help upstream

21:03.780 --> 21:09.580
development and help test and help maintainers actually know what's okay to go in the kernel,

21:09.580 --> 21:10.580
what's not?

21:10.580 --> 21:11.580
Okay.

21:11.580 --> 21:17.260
So how many software testers does it need to change a light bulb?

21:17.260 --> 21:20.620
None, because software testers don't make changes.

21:20.620 --> 21:22.820
They will just report that there's darkness.

21:22.820 --> 21:26.620
There are many, many different continuous integration projects.

21:26.620 --> 21:29.220
And OpenQA is probably another very popular one.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.420
We'll have a link to a talk in the show notes.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.460
This talk is about OpenQA.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.460
The heart of OpenSUSE's automated testing.

21:36.460 --> 21:37.580
I'm Ludwig.

21:37.580 --> 21:45.460
I'm employed by SUSE, and still I am one of the engineers behind OpenQA where it is now.

21:45.460 --> 21:48.220
OpenSUSE is a huge project.

21:48.220 --> 21:50.140
And so they're one of many that take advantage of OpenQA.

21:50.140 --> 21:51.140
Yeah.

21:51.140 --> 21:52.140
I mean, think about it.

21:52.140 --> 21:54.040
It's just too complex to test by hand, right?

21:54.040 --> 21:55.300
There's too many little things that can change.

21:55.300 --> 21:59.020
You have a giant collection of software to handle.

21:59.020 --> 22:02.140
So solving that problem, they introduced OpenQA.

22:02.140 --> 22:06.740
One thing that's kind of neat about OpenQA is it replicates things the way a human might

22:06.740 --> 22:09.640
interact with, you know, simulated keyboard and mouse inputs.

22:09.640 --> 22:15.020
So you can test a huge range of software that might not be amenable to other testing methods.

22:15.020 --> 22:16.020
Yeah.

22:16.020 --> 22:20.340
And Fedora, as we've talked about before on the show, considers OpenQA a, quote, significant

22:20.340 --> 22:23.100
part of their release validation process.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.620
That's one of the great things about open source, right?

22:24.620 --> 22:27.940
I mean, one distribution solves a problem and another one can just take advantage of

22:27.940 --> 22:28.940
it.

22:28.940 --> 22:29.940
No, it is.

22:29.940 --> 22:30.940
It is.

22:30.940 --> 22:34.300
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Popey is joining us now, mid-show.

22:34.300 --> 22:36.180
Popey, welcome to the Unplugged program.

22:36.180 --> 22:39.380
I know you've messed around with Jenkins a bit.

22:39.380 --> 22:43.020
Is there any kind of continuous integration going on over at Canonical for some of the

22:43.020 --> 22:44.180
projects there that you're aware of?

22:44.180 --> 22:45.180
Oh my God.

22:45.180 --> 22:46.180
Tons of it.

22:46.180 --> 22:47.180
Really?

22:47.180 --> 22:48.180
Yeah.

22:48.180 --> 22:49.180
It's all over the place.

22:49.180 --> 22:50.180
Yeah.

22:50.180 --> 22:54.400
We use a little bit of Jenkins and we also use something called Spread, which Spread

22:54.400 --> 22:57.940
does all the testing for SnapD across a whole bunch of different distros.

22:57.940 --> 23:02.700
So we know that SnapD and Snaps work across different distros before we ship it.

23:02.700 --> 23:03.700
Of course.

23:03.700 --> 23:05.300
It makes perfect sense in the Snap scenario.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.500
And don't we appreciate it.

23:06.500 --> 23:12.380
So you have essentially VMs that are running the different distros that Snap could potentially

23:12.380 --> 23:16.780
run on and then when a new builds out, it deploys to those and tests to see if everything's

23:16.780 --> 23:17.780
working?

23:17.780 --> 23:18.780
Yep.

23:18.780 --> 23:20.220
Does it for every pull request as well.

23:20.220 --> 23:23.820
So the more active they are, the more of these machines get sped up.

23:23.820 --> 23:24.820
Yeah, they get busy.

23:24.820 --> 23:25.820
That's great.

23:25.820 --> 23:30.860
I noticed we had a pull request for the Castor Soundboard project on our Jupiter Broadcasting

23:30.860 --> 23:34.340
GitHub from the app image maintainer.

23:34.340 --> 23:39.020
And he said, you know, apply this patch to your project and every time you do a build

23:39.020 --> 23:44.500
now, I'll just pull it down and I'll automatically build an app image of Castor Soundboard.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.500
Sweet.

23:45.500 --> 23:48.300
Gave us instructions to get it hooked up and then using Travis CI and it'll just sort of

23:48.300 --> 23:49.300
build it for us.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.300
Yeah.

23:50.300 --> 23:51.800
It's a Travis CI pipeline.

23:51.800 --> 23:57.140
It's a good example of how you can solve a problem like developing the Linux kernel with

23:57.140 --> 24:02.040
this unbelievable amount of problem domain or it can come all the way down to a simple

24:02.040 --> 24:04.420
open source soundboard that we use here in the network.

24:04.420 --> 24:06.820
Yeah, the same techniques work all over the place.

24:06.820 --> 24:10.020
Yeah, it's really, it's, it's, you got to solve these problems at machine speed.

24:10.020 --> 24:11.180
It's really what it is.

24:11.180 --> 24:17.140
We use, we use Travis a lot for a lot of the snaps we build and at the recent SnapCraft

24:17.140 --> 24:26.440
Summit in Montreal, we had some guys from Travis CI come along because they want to

24:26.440 --> 24:30.820
streamline how they deliver software to the machines that are actually doing the builds

24:30.820 --> 24:35.020
because obviously they're spinning up thousands of these machines all day, every day.

24:35.020 --> 24:38.620
And you know, it's very noticeable for them when Silicon Valley wakes up and everyone

24:38.620 --> 24:43.940
starts committing the code that they've made and all these Travis CI jobs start spinning

24:43.940 --> 24:44.940
up.

24:44.940 --> 24:45.940
That's a lot of workload.

24:45.940 --> 24:50.220
They're constantly trying to optimize these machines to start as fast as possible and

24:50.220 --> 24:55.220
have all the compilers and all the other build tools, the whole build chain in those machines

24:55.220 --> 24:56.220
as fast as possible.

24:56.220 --> 25:00.420
So they spin up and spin down super fast, super fascinating stuff.

25:00.420 --> 25:01.420
It really is.

25:01.420 --> 25:02.420
Yeah.

25:02.420 --> 25:05.220
I would imagine to be the kind of thing that if I was still in IT, I'd probably be building

25:05.220 --> 25:07.780
probably the kind of things I'd be standing up now.

25:07.780 --> 25:13.420
Totally a tangent thing, but is it just me or do you canonical folk have a lot more of

25:13.420 --> 25:14.940
these sprints these days?

25:14.940 --> 25:19.100
It seems like they went from a couple of times a year to all the time, I mean, one a quarter

25:19.100 --> 25:20.100
almost.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.100
Yeah.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.700
Well, yeah, there is a lot of them.

25:22.700 --> 25:23.700
But there's different types.

25:23.700 --> 25:29.380
We have engineering sprints, which we tend to have every six months and roadmap sprints,

25:29.380 --> 25:37.680
which are every three months and then the snap graph summits, which are like ad hoc.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.940
So yeah, there's a fair number of events going on at the moment.

25:39.940 --> 25:43.260
There's a lot of air travel and getting around.

25:43.260 --> 25:44.260
It's good fun.

25:44.260 --> 25:45.260
Good.

25:45.260 --> 25:46.260
I'm glad you don't.

25:46.260 --> 25:47.260
I'm glad you don't mind.

25:47.260 --> 25:48.260
It can be fun.

25:48.260 --> 25:49.260
But you guys do.

25:49.260 --> 25:50.260
You tend to do them in pretty nice locations.

25:50.260 --> 25:52.700
I've been following along on telecast for poppy recently.

25:52.700 --> 25:53.700
It's fun.

25:53.700 --> 25:54.700
It is fun.

25:54.700 --> 25:58.580
Is there like a URL you give out for that that people if we should give it out here

25:58.580 --> 25:59.580
on the show?

25:59.580 --> 26:01.060
Oh, that's very kind of you.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.060
Yeah.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.660
If you you have to be a telegram user, a telegram user.

26:05.660 --> 26:10.740
But what I did was I exported all of the episodes that I made out and I've put them on by my

26:10.740 --> 26:11.740
website.

26:11.740 --> 26:15.940
So there's a recent tweet flow from me about this.

26:15.940 --> 26:20.980
But if you just go to T dot me slash telecast with poppy, you'll get you'll get to the channel

26:20.980 --> 26:24.420
where all the telegram episodes are.

26:24.420 --> 26:28.420
Learn everything about beer and curry you ever wanted to know and more.

26:28.420 --> 26:33.940
You had the most English telecast the other day where you were walking from home to the

26:33.940 --> 26:39.780
pub to get picked up by your friends to go get curry and I just was listening.

26:39.780 --> 26:44.140
It's so fun because it's like what at most, like seven, 10 minutes ever and sometimes

26:44.140 --> 26:45.140
much less.

26:45.140 --> 26:46.300
So it's like who doesn't have time for that?

26:46.300 --> 26:47.300
That's what I wanted it to be.

26:47.300 --> 26:51.420
It's just like ad hoc, just me having a little chat, whatever's on my mind at the time.

26:51.420 --> 26:55.940
So I don't have to go through the whole episode effort of creating an episode of something

26:55.940 --> 26:59.300
and publishing it somewhere and RSS feeds and all that nonsense.

26:59.300 --> 27:03.820
I just press record in telegram and you know, the thoughts come out of my brain, out of

27:03.820 --> 27:06.980
my mouth and into the phone and I give it a preview list and then hit send and that's

27:06.980 --> 27:07.980
it.

27:07.980 --> 27:08.980
Nothing more than that.

27:08.980 --> 27:10.340
I think you're way ahead of us.

27:10.340 --> 27:11.340
Yeah.

27:11.340 --> 27:16.540
Well, so now my last two questions are, are you going to be back on Ubuntu podcast now

27:16.540 --> 27:19.020
that you're done traveling or is more traveling ahead?

27:19.020 --> 27:22.820
So we just recorded two episodes before I dropped in here.

27:22.820 --> 27:24.100
So yeah, I'm back on.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.500
Martin's out because he's on vacation.

27:26.500 --> 27:31.420
So I'm back in and Martin's out and I think in two weeks time we'll have our first one

27:31.420 --> 27:34.660
with all three of us back for a while.

27:34.660 --> 27:39.460
And then last but not least, um, how, how great is user air turning out?

27:39.460 --> 27:41.420
Did you have any idea how great this would be?

27:41.420 --> 27:45.700
I see it as just like three guys chatting and I have no idea.

27:45.700 --> 27:50.620
Like when you say, when you say nice things, Chris, when we get nice comments, we also

27:50.620 --> 27:51.620
get horrible comments.

27:51.620 --> 27:52.620
Of course.

27:52.620 --> 27:53.620
Mostly on YouTube.

27:53.620 --> 28:01.180
Can I just say, can I just say, not only have I been making podcasts for 13, 14 years now,

28:01.180 --> 28:04.980
but I've been listening to them for just as long and this is one of my favorite podcasts

28:04.980 --> 28:05.980
of all time.

28:05.980 --> 28:06.980
Oh, that's very kind of you.

28:06.980 --> 28:10.980
Say Joe, Joe and Daniel put a lot of effort in, oh, come on.

28:10.980 --> 28:11.980
It's always you.

28:11.980 --> 28:12.980
I'm nodding my head to him.

28:12.980 --> 28:13.980
Always like, yeah, that's right.

28:13.980 --> 28:14.980
That's right.

28:14.980 --> 28:17.840
Well, and I've got kids like he does too.

28:17.840 --> 28:23.660
So it's like as Joe calls me centrist dad, my, my wife referred to you the other day,

28:23.660 --> 28:26.300
Pope is that guy who said something about bedsheets.

28:26.300 --> 28:27.900
Oh my God.

28:27.900 --> 28:31.980
It's also, it's like the only show I get to listen to with my wife too.

28:31.980 --> 28:32.980
There's that.

28:32.980 --> 28:37.340
And I think a big part of what makes it work is Daniel Fore from elementary is willing

28:37.340 --> 28:42.520
to take a bit of, as you would say, a piss, like he'll just sit there and he'll just dig

28:42.520 --> 28:43.520
himself in deeper.

28:43.520 --> 28:44.520
He'll take the piss, Chris.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.520
He'll take the piss.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.520
What is it?

28:46.520 --> 28:47.520
I'm sorry.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.520
Not a piss.

28:48.520 --> 28:49.520
Hold on.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.520
Hold on.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.520
Joe came in studio just to correct me.

28:51.520 --> 28:52.520
Hold on.

28:52.520 --> 28:53.520
Yes.

28:53.520 --> 28:54.520
Take the piss, not take a piss.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.520
Okay.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.520
Thank you, Joe.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.520
Hey, Joe.

28:57.520 --> 28:58.520
Joe's here.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.260
We got all, it's a whole family reunion right now.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.780
We're working on a new super secret show, you know?

29:02.780 --> 29:05.260
So yeah, yeah.

29:05.260 --> 29:06.260
Very secret.

29:06.260 --> 29:08.380
So we've got, we've got so secret.

29:08.380 --> 29:13.060
I even flew drew, drew and, uh, and, uh, L and Joe who haven't been on show.

29:13.060 --> 29:14.060
They're here too.

29:14.060 --> 29:17.340
So we've got in studio, we've got cheese and we've got Brent and we've got Alex and it's

29:17.340 --> 29:18.340
a whole JB party.

29:18.340 --> 29:21.700
Wes and myself, and we're working on some new secret stuff.

29:21.700 --> 29:22.820
It's very exciting.

29:22.820 --> 29:28.820
So one thing I would have to say is if any of the listeners want us to answer any particular

29:28.820 --> 29:34.900
question, they just have to let us know with hashtag ask error, ping us in the, the JB telegram

29:34.900 --> 29:39.700
or in IRC, you know where to find, just ping any one of us with your crazy questions for

29:39.700 --> 29:42.260
us to ask about life, the universe and everything.

29:42.260 --> 29:43.660
They get some great questions.

29:43.660 --> 29:48.500
So whatever medium you like to talk to these guys, hashtag ask error and it'll show up

29:48.500 --> 29:53.380
on their radar and then they ponder them in the show and it leads to some of the best

29:53.380 --> 29:55.300
conversation and discussions.

29:55.300 --> 29:56.300
So yeah.

29:56.300 --> 29:59.940
Well, Popey, it's good to have you here and thanks for giving us the comical side of that.

29:59.940 --> 30:02.100
That's a, it's interesting perspective on how they use continuous integration.

30:02.100 --> 30:05.140
It makes total sense, total sense for snaps.

30:05.140 --> 30:09.500
Well, while we are talking about other great podcasts, you notice we don't do quite as

30:09.500 --> 30:10.780
many distro reviews.

30:10.780 --> 30:11.780
We still do a few.

30:11.780 --> 30:16.380
We do like the big benchmark ones, the ones that we can't not do.

30:16.380 --> 30:22.500
But if you want a review from folks who just can't seem to scratch that distro hop itch,

30:22.500 --> 30:23.500
check out Choose Linux.

30:23.500 --> 30:27.940
Here's a clip from each of them on the most recent distro they randomly tried, which is

30:27.940 --> 30:29.980
one I haven't given a go yet, EndlessOS.

30:29.980 --> 30:35.080
I know that we start almost every single distro hop segment with, well, Elle, I see you had

30:35.080 --> 30:38.520
some issues, but not this time.

30:38.520 --> 30:40.820
This time I'm in love.

30:40.820 --> 30:44.260
This is what I thought an operating system was supposed to be like.

30:44.260 --> 30:49.260
When people tell me about how they use Windows, and it's just simple, and you go and you use

30:49.260 --> 30:50.260
it.

30:50.260 --> 30:55.420
I would say that this is the prettiest GNOME retrofit that I've ever seen, too.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.700
It is almost on par with how good Deepin looks.

30:58.700 --> 31:04.420
I can see what you're getting at, Elle, but it's just too simple for me.

31:04.420 --> 31:05.420
Hmm, EndlessOS.

31:05.420 --> 31:08.620
So it's the man who uses XFCE.

31:08.620 --> 31:11.380
Nice, nice.

31:11.380 --> 31:14.020
Also shout out to XFCE Project had a release this week.

31:14.020 --> 31:15.020
Shout out.

31:15.020 --> 31:16.020
Whoop.

31:16.020 --> 31:17.020
At ShoesLinux.

31:17.020 --> 31:20.020
They're also throwing in a few picks here and there.

31:20.020 --> 31:21.020
I don't know.

31:21.020 --> 31:22.460
I might just stop doing the show and just listen to them.

31:22.460 --> 31:23.940
Yeah, we can learn everything we need.

31:23.940 --> 31:24.940
Mm-hmm.

31:24.940 --> 31:25.940
Just listen to them.

31:25.940 --> 31:26.940
All right.

31:26.940 --> 31:27.940
Well, let's do our pick this week.

31:27.940 --> 31:32.180
Now, everybody's always talking about their tiling window managers, and I'm like, yeah,

31:32.180 --> 31:33.180
I know about your i3.

31:33.180 --> 31:38.100
Yeah, I know about your Awesome, but I like me a traditional desktop environment.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.620
That's always been my go-to line.

31:39.620 --> 31:46.060
Well, Wes, today we are going to have our cake and we are going to have it with a delicious

31:46.060 --> 31:47.380
side of ice cream.

31:47.380 --> 31:48.380
That sounds great.

31:48.380 --> 31:49.380
Yeah.

31:49.380 --> 31:50.380
Right?

31:50.380 --> 31:51.700
It's called QuickTile.

31:51.700 --> 31:55.380
Keyboard-driven window tiling for your existing window manager.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.740
I'm sorry, what did you say?

31:57.740 --> 31:58.740
Existing window manager.

31:58.740 --> 31:59.740
Hmm.

31:59.740 --> 32:02.300
Well, existing X11 window manager.

32:02.300 --> 32:04.300
So everybody's existing window manager.

32:04.300 --> 32:06.300
Hey, hey now.

32:06.300 --> 32:07.300
Yeah.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.300
I don't know.

32:08.300 --> 32:12.660
I don't know, like in Choose Linux, they were reviewing OBS.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.820
And now it's like the reviews are getting to the point where you've got to start making

32:14.820 --> 32:15.820
the OBS disclaimer.

32:15.820 --> 32:19.820
Or I mean, I'm sorry, when you're reviewing OBS, you've got to start making the Wayland

32:19.820 --> 32:20.820
disclaimer.

32:20.820 --> 32:21.820
Oh, yeah.

32:21.820 --> 32:22.820
Like a lot of this stuff doesn't work because-

32:22.820 --> 32:25.140
Yeah, or on Wayland, it's just, oh, it's going to be rough.

32:25.140 --> 32:26.140
Hey, we're getting there.

32:26.140 --> 32:27.340
We're all very hopeful about Pipewire.

32:27.340 --> 32:32.160
So what my plan is is to just hang out on XFCE on X11 for a long time, and I'll just

32:32.160 --> 32:37.420
add a little window tiling key binding magic to my XFCE desktop.

32:37.420 --> 32:38.420
With QuickTile.

32:38.420 --> 32:39.420
Yeah.

32:39.420 --> 32:40.420
So that's where QuickTile comes in.

32:40.420 --> 32:44.580
It's an analog also to WinSplit.

32:44.580 --> 32:47.860
And if you remember that, that was an old school.

32:47.860 --> 32:52.500
There was WinSplit and WinSplit Revolution, which were plugins for Compass.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.900
Now if you don't know what I'm talking about, you're-

32:54.900 --> 32:56.180
You got nothing.

32:56.180 --> 32:57.180
You don't know what I'm talking about?

32:57.180 --> 32:58.180
Really?

32:58.180 --> 32:59.180
Oh, my God.

32:59.180 --> 33:00.180
No.

33:00.180 --> 33:01.180
Oh.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.180
Wes, show them the wobbly windows real quick.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.180
Oh, yeah.

33:03.180 --> 33:04.180
I still got the-

33:04.180 --> 33:05.180
So take a look.

33:05.180 --> 33:06.180
Tell me what you think about these wobbly windows.

33:06.180 --> 33:07.180
What do you think of that?

33:07.180 --> 33:08.180
How far is that fun?

33:08.180 --> 33:09.180
What do you think right there?

33:09.180 --> 33:10.180
Yeah.

33:10.180 --> 33:11.180
Or watch what happens when I close a window.

33:11.180 --> 33:12.180
Yeah.

33:12.180 --> 33:13.180
Watch this.

33:13.180 --> 33:14.180
Watch this.

33:14.180 --> 33:15.180
Come on now.

33:15.180 --> 33:16.180
Now, okay.

33:16.180 --> 33:17.180
Honest, your first impression.

33:17.180 --> 33:18.180
Okay.

33:18.180 --> 33:19.180
The wobbly windows I think is super fun.

33:19.180 --> 33:20.180
It sparks joy.

33:20.180 --> 33:21.180
Oh, yeah.

33:21.180 --> 33:22.180
I can't stop smiling.

33:22.180 --> 33:23.180
You're seeing it.

33:23.180 --> 33:24.180
I can't stop smiling.

33:24.180 --> 33:25.180
So I will say I'm a fan of that.

33:25.180 --> 33:26.180
The exploding windows, I don't know.

33:26.180 --> 33:27.180
Yeah.

33:27.180 --> 33:28.180
It felt a little cheesy.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.380
But imagine like you're angry and you want to close something.

33:30.380 --> 33:31.380
Ah.

33:31.380 --> 33:32.380
And you just explode it.

33:32.380 --> 33:34.580
You know what was even better is back in the day they had burn down windows.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.420
You'd close it and it would fire effect and it would burn down.

33:37.420 --> 33:40.580
I'd be okay with like turning the old CRT TVs off.

33:40.580 --> 33:41.580
Yeah.

33:41.580 --> 33:42.580
Oh.

33:42.580 --> 33:43.580
That would be great.

33:43.580 --> 33:49.540
In Plasma, one of the fun things you can do is you can set it so that your windows gray

33:49.540 --> 33:53.180
out when the application crashes, which is kind of a neat effect.

33:53.180 --> 33:54.180
I think I have that in Plasma.

33:54.180 --> 33:55.180
Yeah.

33:55.180 --> 33:56.180
Yeah.

33:56.180 --> 33:57.180
Did you set that up?

33:57.180 --> 33:58.180
Oh, yeah.

33:58.180 --> 33:59.180
No, I didn't set it up.

33:59.180 --> 34:00.180
You could turn on the wobbly windows.

34:00.180 --> 34:01.180
Oh.

34:01.180 --> 34:02.180
Careful.

34:02.180 --> 34:03.180
Yeah.

34:03.180 --> 34:04.180
It's just under desktop effects.

34:04.180 --> 34:05.180
Most of the time.

34:05.180 --> 34:06.180
Right?

34:06.180 --> 34:07.180
Most of the time.

34:07.180 --> 34:09.220
I mean, all those engineers work to build that GPU for something, might as well put

34:09.220 --> 34:10.220
it to the...

34:10.220 --> 34:11.220
I don't even notice anymore.

34:11.220 --> 34:14.540
I kind of like I feel bad showing it because the wobble doesn't seem like it's very wobbly

34:14.540 --> 34:15.540
anymore.

34:15.540 --> 34:16.540
You could up the wobble if you want.

34:16.540 --> 34:17.540
Oh, right.

34:17.540 --> 34:18.540
Of course.

34:18.540 --> 34:19.540
It's Plasma.

34:19.540 --> 34:22.380
So you could increase the wobble factor if you want to increase the wobble factor.

34:22.380 --> 34:29.380
Poppy will not be increasing the wobble factor because he did something that is so 2019 Linux

34:29.380 --> 34:34.180
personality that I just I love and also fully appreciate.

34:34.180 --> 34:39.580
So on Twitter, which God only knows why he chose to do this, he announced that he was

34:39.580 --> 34:41.460
switching away from Plasma.

34:41.460 --> 34:47.100
And then was it six successive tweets explaining how it's okay that you're switching away from

34:47.100 --> 34:50.340
Plasma and that everybody else's choices are okay, too.

34:50.340 --> 34:51.340
Yeah.

34:51.340 --> 34:57.460
I don't like this whole, you know, internet Zed list celebrity has switched from Distro

34:57.460 --> 35:00.900
A to Distro B, the sky is falling rubbish.

35:00.900 --> 35:05.660
So I just had to super clarify everything in a complete succession of tweets.

35:05.660 --> 35:08.960
I liked it, though, because you referenced back the first tweet of when you actually

35:08.960 --> 35:12.420
installed KDE Neon.

35:12.420 --> 35:13.420
And what are you on now?

35:13.420 --> 35:14.420
You just on mainline Ubuntu?

35:14.420 --> 35:18.660
Yeah, Ubuntu 19.04 with GNOME.

35:18.660 --> 35:23.380
What was the was it just time for just trying something else or what was the what was the

35:23.380 --> 35:24.380
impetus?

35:24.380 --> 35:27.580
The actual trigger to this was last week's lup.

35:27.580 --> 35:28.580
Oh, really?

35:28.580 --> 35:33.660
When you I came in, and my audio was all messed up.

35:33.660 --> 35:38.620
I've tried so many things, and I couldn't figure out what the hell it was.

35:38.620 --> 35:41.260
So I thought, okay, there's got to be something fundamental on my system.

35:41.260 --> 35:42.260
I don't know what it is.

35:42.260 --> 35:45.440
And I don't know who to file a bug against, or what projects file a bug against.

35:45.440 --> 35:49.620
So I decided, right, let's just upgrade to the latest of everything.

35:49.620 --> 35:54.940
And if it still happens, then then I can start looking for where the bug is.

35:54.940 --> 35:58.700
And it hasn't happened yet, I don't think.

35:58.700 --> 36:03.140
Which is partly why I'm here to test that this actually works.

36:03.140 --> 36:06.740
I'm wondering if your impression not even necessarily from like a technical level, but

36:06.740 --> 36:11.020
my impression is the GNOME audio stack just seems a little simpler.

36:11.020 --> 36:14.500
Like it just seems like it's sitting right on top of Pulse and whatever Pulse is doing,

36:14.500 --> 36:15.500
that's what GNOME is doing.

36:15.500 --> 36:21.420
So I think part of it is that KDE gives you knobs and buttons to switch, so Plasma gives

36:21.420 --> 36:23.740
you like things you can tweak.

36:23.740 --> 36:29.780
And because the GNOME desktop doesn't, it's harder to shoot yourself in the foot.

36:29.780 --> 36:34.180
And I think it's entirely possible that I've twiddled something in KDE at some point in

36:34.180 --> 36:39.340
the last 18 months, which has made this go bad, and I don't know what that is.

36:39.340 --> 36:40.340
That's possible.

36:40.340 --> 36:42.180
But there are lots of other possibilities as well.

36:42.180 --> 36:45.420
Hardware failure, it could be Pulse audio is rubbish.

36:45.420 --> 36:46.540
There's so many things.

36:46.540 --> 36:51.840
I can't point the finger at any one thing, but yeah, the audio subsystem on GNOME seems

36:51.840 --> 36:53.700
to be simpler.

36:53.700 --> 36:54.700
You sound great today.

36:54.700 --> 36:55.700
Awesome.

36:55.700 --> 36:56.700
Thank you.

36:56.700 --> 36:57.700
That's what matters.

36:57.700 --> 36:58.700
I can't argue with that.

36:58.700 --> 36:59.700
Yeah.

36:59.700 --> 37:03.220
I find that I hop about every nine months now.

37:03.220 --> 37:04.220
It's about my...

37:04.220 --> 37:05.220
Yeah.

37:05.220 --> 37:08.500
It's the problem when all the options are so good.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.500
It's all good.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.740
We're going to do some reloading here in the studio.

37:11.740 --> 37:16.100
In fact, we were thinking about having an on-air debate about what we reload to.

37:16.100 --> 37:20.980
I'm becoming less and less attracted to nuking and paving a system.

37:20.980 --> 37:24.460
So I built an arch system a year ago.

37:24.460 --> 37:30.200
It turned one year old on July 27th, and I've got it set up just the way I like it.

37:30.200 --> 37:33.860
And I don't know if this is just because I've now been using Linux for long enough that

37:33.860 --> 37:40.680
I can actually troubleshoot my problems sufficiently that nuking and paving is no longer a requirement

37:40.680 --> 37:45.540
to get a stable system, or whether it's just because I've become so comfortable in this

37:45.540 --> 37:53.580
pair of old, worn-out, comfy shoes that now it's like I just don't feel the desire to

37:53.580 --> 37:55.180
nuke and pave like I used to.

37:55.180 --> 37:59.500
I mean, I have a Proxmox server in my basement that I can just spin stuff up on.

37:59.500 --> 38:04.100
And my laptop and my desktop are work horses now, and they just need to work.

38:04.100 --> 38:05.100
Sure.

38:05.100 --> 38:09.540
There is an element of you have to know enough about a system because half the re-kicks that

38:09.540 --> 38:12.820
happen on our team are, we did something weird, and we've got to start again.

38:12.820 --> 38:16.180
And if you keep doing it every time, you don't ever quite learn what it was that broke it.

38:16.180 --> 38:19.780
But you always have to do that math, like, ah, my time is worth X, Y, Z.

38:19.780 --> 38:22.340
I know it'll take me two hours to re-kick this thing.

38:22.340 --> 38:29.540
I know it'll take me five hours to troubleshoot it-ish, or more, exactly, exactly, exactly.

38:29.540 --> 38:34.600
But Popey said something in one of his recent telecasts with Popey that I had to respond

38:34.600 --> 38:39.300
back because he said, Popey, you were talking about upgrades, and how people are always

38:39.300 --> 38:43.060
like, we almost have like a wipe and pave or a nuke and pave culture that just sort

38:43.060 --> 38:45.220
of is the default answer.

38:45.220 --> 38:48.220
And it's not necessarily always the best way to go.

38:48.220 --> 38:50.980
Sometimes just upgrading for a while actually is the best way.

38:50.980 --> 38:58.240
Yeah, I've long lamented the fact that people will say don't upgrade because upgrades are

38:58.240 --> 39:01.980
broken and therefore you should always do a clean install.

39:01.980 --> 39:05.140
And I appreciate, you know, sometimes they are broken.

39:05.140 --> 39:13.060
And part of the problem here is that people do all kinds of crazy things to their machines

39:13.060 --> 39:17.340
and then forget they've ever done that, and then six months later they go to upgrade and

39:17.340 --> 39:23.060
something they've done is so fundamental that the upgrade breaks.

39:23.060 --> 39:30.500
Now part of that is they then blame us, the distro maintainer, because we make a shonky

39:30.500 --> 39:35.260
distro that can't upgrade properly, yet they ripped out core components of the desktop

39:35.260 --> 39:38.900
six months ago, but they don't remember because this was just a command they copy and pasted

39:38.900 --> 39:43.940
off of a blog somewhere in order to get a new theme or to get a new splash screen in

39:43.940 --> 39:44.940
grub.

39:44.940 --> 39:47.100
Yeah, disable system D or something stupid.

39:47.100 --> 39:50.300
Or yeah, something ludicrous like that, but they don't know they did it.

39:50.300 --> 39:51.780
Did you hear that I've switched from system D?

39:51.780 --> 39:52.780
It's great.

39:52.780 --> 39:53.780
Troll.

39:53.780 --> 39:54.780
Yeah.

39:54.780 --> 40:00.020
But part of the problem is us in that when we leave people in a really horrible state

40:00.020 --> 40:05.620
when an upgrade breaks, you're left with often a black screen or no way to log in.

40:05.620 --> 40:10.040
Or if you do log in, your desktop doesn't load properly or something, and that's horrible.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.860
And when you're in that state as a user, what are you going to do?

40:12.860 --> 40:15.380
You're going to nuke and pave and then you're going to get it in your head that that's the

40:15.380 --> 40:16.660
right way to upgrade.

40:16.660 --> 40:18.860
And so it becomes ingrained behavior.

40:18.860 --> 40:24.480
And see, for me, this is one of the big advantages of building an Archbox is I know every command

40:24.480 --> 40:29.100
that went into building that thing and I had to go and learn why I'm running that particular

40:29.100 --> 40:30.100
command.

40:30.100 --> 40:36.260
Whereas, as you say, copying and pasting something to piping it to shell is very easy and tempting,

40:36.260 --> 40:41.140
but it can lead to problems down the road that you just don't foresee because you don't

40:41.140 --> 40:42.300
understand what it is you did.

40:42.300 --> 40:44.920
I mean, I love Arch, so don't get me wrong.

40:44.920 --> 40:48.860
But here's the context for the rest of the audience.

40:48.860 --> 40:53.740
Before the show, we were discussing what OS we're going to deploy in the studio after

40:53.740 --> 40:55.440
today's show.

40:55.440 --> 40:58.860
We have a couple of things we just need to address.

40:58.860 --> 41:03.100
Some of these machines were either set up as Kubuntu or Neon, and now they're running

41:03.100 --> 41:07.500
XFCE, and we just want to do a clean install, so it's just a base system.

41:07.500 --> 41:08.500
Start fresh.

41:08.500 --> 41:09.500
Start fresh.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.980
And we want to do it before there's a lot of issues.

41:11.980 --> 41:13.700
There's a couple of niggly things we've noticed.

41:13.700 --> 41:19.180
And then, of course, because it's a group full of Linux geeks, the debate of what distro

41:19.180 --> 41:21.740
we should use has been the number one.

41:21.740 --> 41:22.740
I can't make this up.

41:22.740 --> 41:23.740
Oh, yeah.

41:23.740 --> 41:27.860
No, it really is the serious point of contention.

41:27.860 --> 41:33.820
So Alex is advocating for Arch, Drew is essentially advocating for Ubuntu LTS, and I'm on the

41:33.820 --> 41:37.780
fence leaning towards Fedora.

41:37.780 --> 41:40.100
You say that, but you want Fedora.

41:40.100 --> 41:41.700
You'll be happy to see Fedora chosen.

41:41.700 --> 41:42.700
Yeah, I would be.

41:42.700 --> 41:43.700
I would be.

41:43.700 --> 41:44.700
More Ubuntu.

41:44.700 --> 41:49.180
So I'm going to make my, I'll start.

41:49.180 --> 41:51.420
So Alex just made his case for Arch.

41:51.420 --> 41:57.500
I will counter that with, we started with Arch.

41:57.500 --> 41:58.940
We started with Arch.

41:58.940 --> 41:59.940
And now here we are.

41:59.940 --> 42:05.340
May I add that one of the additional problems that I doubt Alex has that we would have in

42:05.340 --> 42:10.500
the studio is you like to do upgrades immediately before live shows, because that's when you're

42:10.500 --> 42:12.300
here in the studio working on the machines.

42:12.300 --> 42:13.420
There is a little bit of that.

42:13.420 --> 42:14.420
And it's fine.

42:14.420 --> 42:17.700
Like most, you know, when you do the upgrades, when you have time and a safe space, Arch

42:17.700 --> 42:18.700
is fine.

42:18.700 --> 42:19.700
It's very stable.

42:19.700 --> 42:20.700
I've stopped doing that.

42:20.700 --> 42:21.700
Okay.

42:21.700 --> 42:22.700
If you say so.

42:22.700 --> 42:23.700
Well.

42:23.700 --> 42:24.700
You got tricked.

42:24.700 --> 42:32.100
Okay, maybe I haven't completely 100% stopped, but I've reduced.

42:32.100 --> 42:33.980
I want this to be a soundboard clip.

42:33.980 --> 42:34.980
I've moderated.

42:34.980 --> 42:37.260
That three seconds is amazing.

42:37.260 --> 42:41.700
No, I think for me, it's like, I've always felt like a little bit of like spitting into

42:41.700 --> 42:47.540
the wind, but it is also like me saying my operating system should be able to handle

42:47.540 --> 42:48.540
this.

42:48.540 --> 42:53.540
Like, so you probably saw this week that a canonical announced that the absolute latest

42:53.540 --> 42:58.180
and greatest version of Ubuntu LTS now has like a nice gooey way to sign up for the live

42:58.180 --> 43:03.700
patch service, get yourself an Ubuntu one account, and then you can patch three machines

43:03.700 --> 43:07.540
for free and you can do it all through the gooey and then you're secure through reboots

43:07.540 --> 43:10.500
for some of the more important ones.

43:10.500 --> 43:12.860
That's super appealing to me in a studio environment.

43:12.860 --> 43:18.420
And so initially I envisioned like deploying Ubuntu LTS everywhere, bring it all into landscape

43:18.420 --> 43:24.140
using live patch to manage them, and then I started having sound problems, which we've

43:24.140 --> 43:27.980
documented and we've resolved for the most case by switching up to Jack.

43:27.980 --> 43:30.620
It's pretty much solved our problems.

43:30.620 --> 43:35.980
But now we're sitting here with these systems that are sort of Frankensteined and I've had

43:35.980 --> 43:39.820
a lot of experience in the last nine months.

43:39.820 --> 43:40.820
I don't know.

43:40.820 --> 43:41.820
How long has it been?

43:41.820 --> 43:42.820
Yeah.

43:42.820 --> 43:43.820
Six, nine months.

43:43.820 --> 43:47.300
Yeah, messing with Fedora and it seems like a very clean, reliable system that has good

43:47.300 --> 43:49.460
solid upgrades.

43:49.460 --> 43:52.060
And Drew himself has some good experience with it.

43:52.060 --> 43:53.540
Doesn't hurt that our editor loves it.

43:53.540 --> 43:58.140
And between the two of you, like we can pretty much pull anything off with Jack audio.

43:58.140 --> 44:02.580
So I kind of feel like maybe it's time to just switch to Fedora and then we have Fedora

44:02.580 --> 44:04.940
on the server and on the systems.

44:04.940 --> 44:10.260
And that's the part that appeals to me the most is one common OS, one common environment.

44:10.260 --> 44:13.540
The server's running Fedora, my laptop's running Fedora, the studio systems are running

44:13.540 --> 44:14.580
Fedora.

44:14.580 --> 44:16.180
Everything is the same environment.

44:16.180 --> 44:18.580
And you are, I mean, you're kind of the primary admin.

44:18.580 --> 44:21.780
You're here in the studio the most, you're using the machines the most, so that's not

44:21.780 --> 44:22.780
for nothing.

44:22.780 --> 44:23.780
Right.

44:23.780 --> 44:30.380
But I don't want to do it at the expense of software availability or reduced production

44:30.380 --> 44:31.380
quality.

44:31.380 --> 44:34.140
And so that's where I wonder if Drew has a case for Ubuntu LTS.

44:34.140 --> 44:35.880
So I do.

44:35.880 --> 44:42.760
But before I get to that case, I will say I am already maintaining a group of packages

44:42.760 --> 44:48.580
that do what we need it to do for my own use because I use Fedora on my workstations as

44:48.580 --> 44:49.580
well.

44:49.580 --> 44:50.580
I know.

44:50.580 --> 44:51.960
That's why I think it's funny that you're going to come in here and advocate for Ubuntu.

44:51.960 --> 44:57.220
So I would be comfortable with the studio having Fedora.

44:57.220 --> 44:59.320
To me, it does make sense.

44:59.320 --> 45:07.060
What I like about Ubuntu LTS is the longstanding nature of it.

45:07.060 --> 45:15.380
Fedora 30 is going to be supported until, what, two years after release, right?

45:15.380 --> 45:19.740
And we'd probably bump up to 31 after that arrives.

45:19.740 --> 45:24.060
And it's a lot of upgrading.

45:24.060 --> 45:31.900
And it is targeting a use case that is more agile than a production machine like a recording

45:31.900 --> 45:33.800
studio to me should be.

45:33.800 --> 45:40.860
I will grant you, going Fedora is conceding that we are getting on an upgrade tread machine.

45:40.860 --> 45:41.860
Yes.

45:41.860 --> 45:42.860
Yes.

45:42.860 --> 45:50.500
So that is why I think the Ubuntu LTS route is probably the better route for a production

45:50.500 --> 45:52.100
machine.

45:52.100 --> 45:54.860
Workstations, those can be great and agile.

45:54.860 --> 45:57.020
And that's what I do at home.

45:57.020 --> 46:03.500
But if you want something to be fairly static and work the same way every time, an LTS is

46:03.500 --> 46:06.700
kind of the, to me, it's the right way to go.

46:06.700 --> 46:10.300
And the Ubuntu Studio repositories are fantastic.

46:10.300 --> 46:13.740
They have everything that I put in my Fedora repositories already in there.

46:13.740 --> 46:14.740
So really-

46:14.740 --> 46:16.780
How do people find that repo?

46:16.780 --> 46:23.180
If you just do a search on the Fedora copper for Drew of Doom or Linux Pro Audio, they'll

46:23.180 --> 46:24.180
find it.

46:24.180 --> 46:25.180
Because it's actually really nice.

46:25.180 --> 46:26.900
Some of those tools have not been on Fedora before this.

46:26.900 --> 46:29.720
So it's actually really nice that you're doing that.

46:29.720 --> 46:31.160
So Wes, here's my argument.

46:31.160 --> 46:35.900
My counter-argument, because everything Drew said, can argue with that, absolutely solid,

46:35.900 --> 46:39.060
especially when you add the fact that we could use live patch so we could actually even keep

46:39.060 --> 46:41.220
the system secure without having to reboot them.

46:41.220 --> 46:43.480
That's super attractive.

46:43.480 --> 46:47.100
And I would only need these three systems, it doesn't need to be more than that.

46:47.100 --> 46:52.180
But you're working on Jack in the Box, which is a project to take a lot of the audio routing

46:52.180 --> 46:57.600
and put it inside a Docker container and sort of normalize the desktop in the OS.

46:57.600 --> 47:02.020
And if we were to roll out something like that, it wouldn't really matter.

47:02.020 --> 47:06.840
Yeah, I mean, that is kind of the flip side of we could adopt Ubuntu LTS, but eventually

47:06.840 --> 47:12.060
we will have to upgrade and that's a long, it's going to be a long time, possibly.

47:12.060 --> 47:13.280
That's good and bad.

47:13.280 --> 47:17.780
If we do go with Fedora, we're going to get a lot of practice following the upgrade path.

47:17.780 --> 47:21.100
Well, and then also, I think we could probably take advantage more quickly of things like

47:21.100 --> 47:22.100
pipeline as well.

47:22.100 --> 47:23.100
Right.

47:23.100 --> 47:27.380
So I think it's kind of the difference between what Drew's suggesting and making them really

47:27.380 --> 47:30.540
appliances like things we'd be, you know, you find in a rack you don't futz with.

47:30.540 --> 47:31.540
Right.

47:31.540 --> 47:36.740
And as much as we do use these as a production machine, they're also content sometimes.

47:36.740 --> 47:41.780
And you know, we are still adapting our pipeline, how we do the shows, and we probably are going

47:41.780 --> 47:43.340
to continue doing that for a while.

47:43.340 --> 47:47.140
Part of me wants to use these shows as a way to push forward the most modern way to develop

47:47.140 --> 47:48.140
audio.

47:48.140 --> 47:49.140
Right.

47:49.140 --> 47:52.540
And like, we're doing some super freaking cool stuff with Linux audio right now.

47:52.540 --> 47:54.860
Alex, I know you want to jump in.

47:54.860 --> 47:55.860
I want to give you a chance.

47:55.860 --> 47:56.860
Yeah, I do.

47:56.860 --> 48:02.100
So I've been looking in the fedoraproject.org website whilst you've been talking, and the

48:02.100 --> 48:09.140
average lifespan of a fedora release hovers around the shortest is 330 days.

48:09.140 --> 48:10.780
So just under a year.

48:10.780 --> 48:14.180
The longest is 420 days, and that was Fedora 22.

48:14.180 --> 48:17.940
But on average, it seems to hover around that 380 mark.

48:17.940 --> 48:21.820
So you are, you know, signing up to get on this train of upgrading at least every nine

48:21.820 --> 48:22.820
months.

48:22.820 --> 48:23.820
Yeah.

48:23.820 --> 48:24.820
By the looks of it.

48:24.820 --> 48:25.820
That's what I estimate.

48:25.820 --> 48:32.020
But having to upgrade, it could be a really inconvenient time because these releases come,

48:32.020 --> 48:35.940
they say every six months with Fedora, but they also have a big disclaimer underneath

48:35.940 --> 48:40.780
that says it will be approximately six months depending, it will be done when it's done,

48:40.780 --> 48:42.180
is the disclaimer.

48:42.180 --> 48:44.380
So it could end up shifting slightly.

48:44.380 --> 48:48.220
So it won't be like, okay, it's May Linux Fest Northwest is out of the way, we can safely

48:48.220 --> 48:51.620
upgrade this box now, you might end up having to wait a bit.

48:51.620 --> 48:55.780
So I mean, for me, a rolling distro, you never really have to worry about that kind of stuff.

48:55.780 --> 49:01.260
I can also see where Drew's coming from, though, with the LTS being a minimum to probably four

49:01.260 --> 49:03.580
years worth of updates and stuff.

49:03.580 --> 49:06.820
I mean, for me, I'd probably go that route, right?

49:06.820 --> 49:10.380
I mean, yeah, 1804 is really in that sweet spot, right?

49:10.380 --> 49:11.380
It's really good.

49:11.380 --> 49:16.060
And, you know, one other option that hasn't been floated, Centos.

49:16.060 --> 49:19.700
If you're doing everything in a container, it doesn't make it, you're not giving up what,

49:19.700 --> 49:22.980
you know, the thing Chris said, he doesn't want to give up software availability.

49:22.980 --> 49:26.860
If you're doing it on Centos, and everything's in a container, then part of me feels like

49:26.860 --> 49:32.540
I'm like, not participating, like I'm watching Linux on the on the from the benches, if I

49:32.540 --> 49:36.700
if I'm using Centos, you have a laptop for that you have.

49:36.700 --> 49:38.860
These are production machines that just need to work.

49:38.860 --> 49:41.140
I have a proposition for you, Chris.

49:41.140 --> 49:45.220
How about you do whatever it is you're going to do now.

49:45.220 --> 49:47.740
And then you'll get it out of your system.

49:47.740 --> 49:55.620
And then in nine months time, switch to 2004 LTS, where you can have ZFS on route.

49:55.620 --> 49:58.780
And then you can do snapshots before you do your upgrades.

49:58.780 --> 50:00.420
And then you won't have to worry about it.

50:00.420 --> 50:01.420
There you go.

50:01.420 --> 50:02.420
He has a point there.

50:02.420 --> 50:03.420
It's very logical.

50:03.420 --> 50:07.500
It's very, that is, as, as the good Mr. Spock would say, logical.

50:07.500 --> 50:10.820
I guess I'm struggling to come up with a reason now.

50:10.820 --> 50:14.580
I think we've made a good case for the LTS, especially since the package availability

50:14.580 --> 50:17.380
is there from the other flavors.

50:17.380 --> 50:23.300
I guess what would you propose is our solution, then, for the variance between production

50:23.300 --> 50:24.300
and workstations?

50:24.300 --> 50:29.140
I mean, we work for a company called Linux Academy, right?

50:29.140 --> 50:31.340
I think it's I think we can solve that problem.

50:31.340 --> 50:36.780
I think it's a good thing to be familiar with multiple different flavors of Linux.

50:36.780 --> 50:37.780
You're right.

50:37.780 --> 50:38.780
You're right.

50:38.780 --> 50:40.900
You know, I mean, as host of Choose Linux, I ought to be right.

50:40.900 --> 50:46.820
But yeah, no, it's I don't I don't see any reason to pigeonhole ourselves into saying,

50:46.820 --> 50:52.420
we run Fedora only or we run Ubuntu only or any.

50:52.420 --> 50:57.540
To me, I like being familiar with multiple different systems and I feel comfortable administrating

50:57.540 --> 50:58.540
them all.

50:58.540 --> 50:59.540
All right.

50:59.540 --> 51:00.540
So let's do it then.

51:00.540 --> 51:01.540
Let's do.

51:01.540 --> 51:05.420
I think we should use Ubuntu 1804 LTS right here.

51:05.420 --> 51:06.980
That'll be what we reload the system to.

51:06.980 --> 51:10.940
We just got to make sure we make sure it's decent because like there's some some excess

51:10.940 --> 51:14.520
ego in run right now and some of the window management.

51:14.520 --> 51:16.300
It's just it's kind of bare bones.

51:16.300 --> 51:17.300
What?

51:17.300 --> 51:18.300
Are you proposing something else?

51:18.300 --> 51:19.300
No, not necessarily.

51:19.300 --> 51:22.620
I'm just saying, you know, we want to make sure it's easy to use windows.

51:22.620 --> 51:23.620
Well, that wouldn't hurt.

51:23.620 --> 51:24.620
Can I can I tell you about it?

51:24.620 --> 51:26.340
OK, we got to make sure we install a dock.

51:26.340 --> 51:27.340
What about QuickTile?

51:27.340 --> 51:28.340
What about using QuickTile?

51:28.340 --> 51:29.340
Yeah.

51:29.340 --> 51:31.940
You know, it is also Python, so we could probably script it, too.

51:31.940 --> 51:32.940
Yeah.

51:32.940 --> 51:33.940
Oh, yeah, you can.

51:33.940 --> 51:34.940
Oh, absolutely.

51:34.940 --> 51:35.940
Yeah.

51:35.940 --> 51:40.940
You've you've whipped together a couple of hacks using XRender, which has been helpful.

51:40.940 --> 51:41.940
We could expand on that.

51:41.940 --> 51:42.940
But you're right.

51:42.940 --> 51:47.380
The XFC does lack some modern window rules and stuff like that that are super nice and

51:47.380 --> 51:48.380
plasma.

51:48.380 --> 51:51.780
We just I'm just saying we just we should think about those things as we go forward.

51:51.780 --> 51:55.140
Thankfully on the LTS, it really doesn't matter what base distribution we just can't we can

51:55.140 --> 51:58.800
mix it up and install this Wesley Wesley Wesley, Ben, you're coming at me.

51:58.800 --> 52:00.700
You're coming at me with questions, not solutions right now.

52:00.700 --> 52:01.700
I mean, you're to me.

52:01.700 --> 52:02.700
You're just I don't know what you mean.

52:02.700 --> 52:06.460
You mean we can't use Ubuntu like my head's spinning now, like my whole world is falling

52:06.460 --> 52:07.460
apart.

52:07.460 --> 52:08.460
I just want you to trick it out for me.

52:08.460 --> 52:13.820
Adopting a distro like a religion is stupid.

52:13.820 --> 52:14.820
Thank you, Thomas.

52:14.820 --> 52:15.820
Very well.

52:15.820 --> 52:19.660
So what are your feelings on the current iteration of Ubuntu with Gnome as the default?

52:19.660 --> 52:21.260
Like, how do you feel about Gnome these days?

52:21.260 --> 52:23.540
Because I know you've had a actually, I think Gnome looks great.

52:23.540 --> 52:27.020
You know, I don't want to steal anyone's thunder, but one of our team members here is trying

52:27.020 --> 52:28.020
it out.

52:28.020 --> 52:32.300
And I was looking over his or her shoulder and it looks so good, you know, just looks

52:32.300 --> 52:33.300
so good.

52:33.300 --> 52:37.380
It's just not what I need for production appliance systems.

52:37.380 --> 52:43.220
I actually would prefer nothing has a no compositor, no no special 3D effects, no nothing.

52:43.220 --> 52:44.220
I3 then.

52:44.220 --> 52:45.220
I got it.

52:45.220 --> 52:46.220
All right.

52:46.220 --> 52:47.220
Oof.

52:47.220 --> 52:49.220
Chase, did you hear what he just said?

52:49.220 --> 52:51.300
He said I3 on a production machine.

52:51.300 --> 52:55.820
I'm glad you guys I just was just listening to all you guys hash it out.

52:55.820 --> 53:01.340
The reality is, is that Drew is right, is that you should use the LTS because.

53:01.340 --> 53:02.340
Maybe we should do I3.

53:02.340 --> 53:03.340
Long term support, fellas.

53:03.340 --> 53:04.340
Hey, what do you think?

53:04.340 --> 53:05.340
Maybe we should we give I3 a go?

53:05.340 --> 53:06.340
Yeah, if you're down, let's do it.

53:06.340 --> 53:08.660
I mean, I3 is great.

53:08.660 --> 53:09.660
Let's give it a go.

53:09.660 --> 53:12.500
And then we'll say we'll give it a review in next week.

53:12.500 --> 53:14.380
You want to put a cheat sheet on the wall next to you?

53:14.380 --> 53:15.380
Yeah, good call.

53:15.380 --> 53:16.380
Cheat sheet.

53:16.380 --> 53:17.380
All right.

53:17.380 --> 53:18.380
OK.

53:18.380 --> 53:19.380
All right.

53:19.380 --> 53:20.380
Well, we'll see how that goes.

53:20.380 --> 53:21.380
So make sure you tune back next Tuesday.

53:21.380 --> 53:22.380
You can join us live over at jblive.tv.

53:22.380 --> 53:50.340
You can burn it at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar and see you next Tuesday.

53:52.380 --> 54:02.100
It's for people who like to mess with computers, if you and you know who you are, if you're

54:02.100 --> 54:03.100
somebody who doesn't want to mess with it.

54:03.100 --> 54:04.100
I just want to surf.

54:04.100 --> 54:09.140
I just want to buy something on Amazon, send an email to my kids, look at some websites.

54:09.140 --> 54:12.240
If that's you, you don't want to mess with it.

54:12.240 --> 54:13.240
Probably not a good choice.

54:13.240 --> 54:14.780
What was that hesitation before?

54:14.780 --> 54:15.780
Look at some websites.

54:15.780 --> 54:22.340
You know what's funny is Leo actually now is he's a pretty happy desktop Linux user.

54:22.340 --> 54:24.020
That's what I hear.

54:24.020 --> 54:25.900
Neil, how was Flock?

54:25.900 --> 54:28.180
It was awesome.

54:28.180 --> 54:32.380
Aside from being in Hungary, which I've never been to before, which was it was an experience

54:32.380 --> 54:33.380
in itself.

54:33.380 --> 54:37.740
It was great meeting all these people again for another year and seeing a bunch of new

54:37.740 --> 54:39.000
faces do.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.260
Now this is the old Fedora Developers Conference.

54:42.260 --> 54:44.180
And did you did you get anything accomplished?

54:44.180 --> 54:47.760
Did you achieve any kind of kumbaya on anything that you set out for?

54:47.760 --> 54:50.220
Like how was that aspect of it?

54:50.220 --> 54:56.680
So from my point of view, the big thing was I wanted to see, you know, how the relationship

54:56.680 --> 55:01.780
between the new RHEL 8 and Fedora is going to work out and like talk with some of the

55:01.780 --> 55:09.380
people about the extra packages for Enterprise Linux for RHEL 8, as well as the Fedora modularity

55:09.380 --> 55:15.120
thing and its downstream RHEL cousin, the application stream stuff.

55:15.120 --> 55:19.480
So that was that was a big chunk of what I was looking toward.

55:19.480 --> 55:23.600
But there was also some great things about how we're going to handle some of the changes

55:23.600 --> 55:24.820
in the Python ecosystem.

55:24.820 --> 55:29.520
You already know from my previous times being on Live Subplugged, talking about murdering

55:29.520 --> 55:32.600
Python 2 in its sleep.

55:32.600 --> 55:36.860
So there there was that as well as looking forward to the future of where, you know,

55:36.860 --> 55:43.900
in the Python ecosystem is evolving the way that software is developed and shipped and

55:43.900 --> 55:48.700
things like that and stuff like, you know, getting into weeds of it, things like dist

55:48.700 --> 55:50.140
utils and set up tools.

55:50.140 --> 55:54.100
If you're familiar with Python development have been the staple or nearly the requirement

55:54.100 --> 55:56.580
for everything that's going away as a requirement.

55:56.580 --> 56:01.220
And that requires that means that a lot of things about how we assume Python software

56:01.220 --> 56:03.660
is shipped has to change.

56:03.660 --> 56:05.860
And we have the most important part.

56:05.860 --> 56:06.860
Mm hmm.

56:06.860 --> 56:07.860
Did you get sick?

56:07.860 --> 56:08.860
No.

56:08.860 --> 56:09.860
Yeah.

56:09.860 --> 56:10.860
Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations.

56:10.860 --> 56:11.860
Congratulations.

56:11.860 --> 56:12.860
That's moving on.

56:12.860 --> 56:20.620
You know, next your next level conferencing now, Neil, that's what that means.
