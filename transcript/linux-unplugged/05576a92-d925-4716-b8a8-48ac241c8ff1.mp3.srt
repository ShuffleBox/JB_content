1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
Well, Wes and I were having this conversation

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,720
before the show started and it went something like this.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,240
It was, in some ways, Linux has suffered greatly

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,280
by having its focus scattered across

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,480
so many different initiatives

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,200
and so many different efforts.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,400
You know, you have so many different takes

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,040
even just on GTK desktops, let alone GNOME versus Plasma.

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,280
Even in the Plasma space, you've got LXQ,

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,640
there's all these different iterations.

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,340
And you look at the Apple model or the Windows model

12
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,140
and you go, if we just had a team

13
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,720
that focused on a singular application,

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,680
things would be a lot better.

15
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,460
And the example you went to was Gparted, right?

16
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,300
Oh yeah, right.

17
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,120
Gparted's fine, but it really hasn't gotten a ton better.

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,600
And there's other partition managers

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,380
like Kpart or whatever it is that are fine,

20
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,320
but they're not like the definitive beat all tools.

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,560
And if we were developing one partition manager,

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,340
it would probably be pretty great at this point.

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,980
And I think all of us have always,

24
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,920
you know, we've thought about that.

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,760
But in light of the news of IBM buying Red Hat,

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,000
you kind of have to appreciate the,

27
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,400
I don't know what to call it.

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,080
There's like upsides of this diversity of thought, right?

29
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,920
Yeah.

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,380
We have less net things per unit,

31
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,320
but we have a lot of redundancy.

32
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,920
It takes us way longer to get there in some cases,

33
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,640
but we also are not victim to the bus factor as much.

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,320
Linux could be hurt if say,

35
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,120
all of Red Hat's open source desktop initiatives

36
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,640
went away in a year.

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,980
Desktop Linux would be hurt,

38
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,160
but that code would still be free software.

39
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,700
It wouldn't end desktop Linux.

40
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,720
And those contributors that worked at Red Hat

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,240
could still decide to contribute.

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,080
They have-

43
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,900
People could pick it up.

44
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,920
Like, yeah, there's a lot of options.

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,540
So it is both a blessing and a curse in a sense,

46
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,220
because sometimes it means we can't have the shiniest,

47
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,160
but it also means you really can't take it away from us.

48
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,440
Yeah, I think that's why you have to be careful.

49
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,520
When you, I mean, you just said, if it goes away,

50
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,780
I mean, it won't go away.

51
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,620
It's free software.

52
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,440
It's out on the internet.

53
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,600
None of this stuff is going to go away.

54
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,720
And I'm a glass half full kind of guy,

55
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,280
and I don't have any inside knowledge

56
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,640
of the IBM Red Hat deal,

57
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,680
but I can't see them throwing away that giant body

58
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,640
of good free software.

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,320
I just can't see that happening.

60
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,120
And so, and even if it did,

61
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,240
the software is still out there.

62
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,440
People will coalesce around it,

63
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
who are passionate about it,

64
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,480
and we'll keep it going,

65
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,200
just like every other free software project

66
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,160
that gets dumped by, you know, a corporation.

67
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,840
This is Linux Unplugged,

68
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,920
episode 273 for October 30th, 2018.

69
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,080
that's sort of wishing

71
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,080
it was a stock advice show right now.

72
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,920
My name is Chris.

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,760
My name is Wes.

74
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,260
Oh, some of that Red Hat stock

75
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,680
would be looking pretty good.

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,960
We have a big show for you this week.

77
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,920
I'm back from the BSD den,

78
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,160
went down, hanged out,

79
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,880
meet BSD at the Intel campus.

80
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,440
I'll give you my book report

81
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,520
on how it went at meet BSD.

82
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,440
Then we'll get into some community news.

83
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,240
Well, actually we'll start with some community news,

84
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,500
including that massive IBM buying Red Hat story,

85
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,840
but there's other things too to talk about.

86
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,880
In fact, there's quite a bit of community news

87
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,760
that I would still consider this a packed news show.

88
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,040
Oh yeah, even if that didn't happen,

89
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
it's a giant show.

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,120
We've been doing less news,

91
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,660
but there's just so much we gotta talk about,

92
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,500
so much going on.

93
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,720
The community keeps making news.

94
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,560
It's great.

95
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,040
It's a good time to be a Linux user.

96
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,700
And then today, as we record the latest

97
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,740
and greatest Fedora, Fedora 29 is out.

98
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,960
We'll give you our first impressions of Fedora 29,

99
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,040
and I'll tell you about my favorite feature

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,140
that I am so excited to see finally land in Fedora.

101
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,420
Also, my report, good or bad,

102
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,720
on how my Fedora cloud upgrade went.

103
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,840
This is the one that I've been upgrading for a while now,

104
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,500
and it's now also the home

105
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,460
to my in-production Nextcloud instance.

106
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,720
So this, it mattered more than-

107
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,560
This upgrade counts.

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,400
It was, yeah, this upgrade really counted,

109
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,900
so I'll give you my report

110
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,180
on how that upgrade went as well.

111
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,440
Then some follow-up items from the past couple of episodes,

112
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,800
as well as a huge announcement for a friend of the show,

113
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,020
and then a couple of workarounds

114
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,840
if you're sticking with Dropbox

115
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,560
and don't feel like formatting your disk,

116
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,200
give you a couple of workarounds for that.

117
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,760
I can tell you're thinking about this a lot.

118
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,600
Who, me?

119
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,420
Yeah, you.

120
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,260
But before we go any further,

121
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,040
we gotta bring in that virtual log.

122
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,640
Time, appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

123
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,680
Good morning.

124
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,920
Hello, hello, everybody.

125
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,520
We got Eric in there, MiniMech, Popey, Sean,

126
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,760
and is that two Seans?

127
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,800
No, C, I gotta look, I'm an old man,

128
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,640
and Wimpy.

129
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,540
It's good to have you guys in there.

130
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,340
Rumor has it a few others may be trickling in

131
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,920
as the show goes along.

132
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,880
Speegling, speaking, speegling, speegling, Wes,

133
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,060
speeglingling of trickling in.

134
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,840
Mr. Linus Torvalds is trickling back

135
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440
into command of the Linux kernel.

136
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,800
That will be old news.

137
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,140
This is actually kind of old news now

138
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,640
by the time we're talking about it in this show.

139
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,280
I mean, the Ubuntu podcast guys

140
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,920
talked about it on last Thursday.

141
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,840
It was fresh for them.

142
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,280
They got, the Ubuntu podcast guys

143
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,720
were the first, I believe, to air with the story.

144
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,100
Yeah, look at you guys over there,

145
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,360
Mr. Breakin' News over there

146
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,600
at the Ubuntu podcast decision.

147
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,280
This is CNN Breakin' News.

148
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,120
And-

149
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,960
But you don't have to watch CNN.

150
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,120
You can just listen to the great Ubuntu podcast instead.

151
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,960
I like them more.

152
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,640
It's way better, it's way better, yeah.

153
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,720
So this is kind of old news,

154
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,040
but I just wanted to kind of close the loop on this story.

155
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,880
Greg Kh posted in the kernel 4.19 release announcement,

156
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,480
and it's a long post.

157
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,240
And right in there, he writes a couple of things

158
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,160
that I thought were powerful statements,

159
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
powerful, that we should read here on the show.

160
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,040
He says, these past few months

161
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,440
have been tough one for our community,

162
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,460
as it is our community that is fighting from within itself,

163
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,960
the prodding from others out,

164
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,640
and with prodding from outside.

165
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,180
Don't fall into the cycle of arguing about those others.

166
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,960
That is the trap that countless communities

167
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,920
have fallen into over the centuries.

168
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,400
We all share the same goal.

169
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,500
Let us never lose sight of that.

170
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,500
It's good.

171
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,320
That's a good message.

172
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,160
I mean, it's true, right?

173
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,200
I mean, we're all here for the same reason,

174
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,080
to support the same project, to help the project grow.

175
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,600
The thing that resonates there with me, Mr. West,

176
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,540
the real synergy I got with that, you know,

177
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,040
the top level thing there-

178
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,880
Oh, stop, oh, stop.

179
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,720
Okay, sorry.

180
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,680
This is something that has affected countless communities

181
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,520
over the centuries.

182
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,200
It's a human nature thing.

183
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,440
It's not a Linux kernel mailing list thing.

184
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,280
And that's true, right?

185
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,600
I mean, this is a human activity done by lots of humans

186
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,080
with different motivations and goals,

187
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,440
and that's what makes it so difficult.

188
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,260
He wraps it up with, and with all of that, Linus,

189
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,800
I'm handing the kernel tree back to you.

190
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,640
You can have the joy of dealing with the next merge window.

191
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,460
I'm outta here.

192
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,300
That's good.

193
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,720
It's good to see Linus back.

194
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,900
Everybody's been watching to see how Linus behaves.

195
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,900
Like, the spotlight was on him before, but holy crap.

196
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,820
Now it's like everything he's writing

197
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,740
is being analyzed by the news media.

198
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,580
Have you seen this?

199
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,860
Like, people are just copying and pasting,

200
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,340
like mail, his entire post.

201
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,500
Yeah, he writes something and then it's news now.

202
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,460
Oh, that's annoying.

203
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,420
Let the man work.

204
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,360
I don't know, mumble room, any take on Linus being back?

205
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,460
Was that a long enough break for him to really make

206
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,980
an actual substantive change?

207
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,140
What do you guys think?

208
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,980
That's long enough for him to put an email filter

209
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,060
on his email system.

210
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,060
So yeah, probably.

211
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,260
Is that the takeaway here?

212
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,420
Is that the lesson that Linus learned?

213
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,720
Because that's what everybody's talking about.

214
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,380
Well, it looks like you put a filter on.

215
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,280
It will be the most popular email filter in history

216
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,040
and everyone will be using it this time next year.

217
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,340
There will be whole businesses built on top of it.

218
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,580
And IBM will buy them.

219
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,900
There it is.

220
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,140
I would hope the willingness to implement a filter.

221
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,840
Like, I don't think any of this is a thing

222
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,140
you learn in a month.

223
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,580
Hopefully it just means that he's thinking about it.

224
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,560
These are things he's aware of

225
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,140
and that there's a little more focus

226
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,820
on the health of the community.

227
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,020
Yeah, it's an ongoing thing.

228
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,700
Right, it has to be.

229
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,600
That's a good point, Wes.

230
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,440
That's very wise.

231
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,280
That was sage.

232
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,100
I like that.

233
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,020
This is something I could use some sage wisdom for.

234
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,980
Now, Michael Aribel over at Ferronix,

235
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,980
and I haven't seen,

236
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,820
I don't think I've seen confirmation of this anywhere else.

237
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,900
So keep that in mind.

238
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,580
But, cause it seems like big news.

239
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,060
He's reporting that Samsung has apparently shut down

240
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,320
the Samsung open source group,

241
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,460
commonly known as Samsung OSG,

242
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,240
which you'll see like in their kernel contributions

243
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,740
or whatnot.

244
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,740
And it appears that they are disbanding this division,

245
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,060
which is responsible for quite a bit of contributions.

246
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,100
They've been around since 2012.

247
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,500
They employ a dozen developers for a number of years now.

248
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,880
Yeah, and I mean, they've contributed to things like,

249
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,820
well, Wayland, Xorg, Cairo, Klang, Gstreamer, FFmpeg,

250
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,100
and of course a whole bunch to that there Linux kernel

251
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,860
we were just talking about.

252
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,340
Yeah, so it would kind of be a big deal,

253
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,740
especially you got to wonder about Wayland

254
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,020
if they were to go away.

255
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,340
They're usually in the top five kernel contributors,

256
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,420
like the total in the top five.

257
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,420
I mean, and this just feels very, very timely, right?

258
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,580
Where corporations play a big part

259
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,980
and they are not obligated to in open source development.

260
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,820
So we just, right, we're lucky to have them.

261
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,300
We benefit from this.

262
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,900
Why are they closing this?

263
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,740
Maybe they're done.

264
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,680
Like, hey, we got everything we needed.

265
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,940
All right, well, Google says,

266
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,080
we're going to have to use this kernel

267
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,220
for the next X amount of years.

268
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,860
So we don't have to develop any new drivers for a while.

269
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,700
We're out.

270
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,520
See you.

271
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,360
But that's not how it works.

272
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,460
That's not how software development works.

273
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,420
So it could be a hundred things.

274
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,000
It could be just a restructuring.

275
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,100
Right, that's still the open source work.

276
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,420
It's just under one umbrella anymore.

277
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,260
It's a good question.

278
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,460
One hopes, Wes, one certainly hopes

279
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,740
because it is funny, I'm not Samsung's biggest fan,

280
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,980
but it seems like they've made genuine contributions

281
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,660
that really have made a difference.

282
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,980
I mean, you look in the top five, that matters.

283
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,820
That matters.

284
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,940
Hopefully it's not a total abandonment.

285
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,500
It also makes me think about just,

286
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,320
we look at like Linux kernel contributors,

287
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,860
but when a company contributes across so many projects,

288
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,020
we don't often get a view

289
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,420
into just all the things they're doing.

290
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,740
You might see pockets of that.

291
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,080
Oh, they support Krita or whatever,

292
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,820
but a lot of these companies are pretty broad support.

293
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,140
You're touching on something there

294
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,040
that really grinds my gears, Wes.

295
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,060
And that is that a lot of times these companies

296
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,380
are contributing to open source

297
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,580
and they do it kind of quietly.

298
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,900
Like you're not even aware of what they're doing.

299
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,100
And there's a real resistance to them talking about it.

300
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,660
They don't, and I say this from somebody

301
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,180
who tries to talk to them about it.

302
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,180
And it's, they'll talk to you

303
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,860
in like a non-formal setting off air,

304
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,540
but they won't talk to you in any official capacity.

305
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,300
And when you go to events in a lot of cases,

306
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,980
they won't even talk to me.

307
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,620
Like I can't, I'm not allowed to like speak to an engineer.

308
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,260
Like if their engineer realizes that I'm from the media,

309
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,740
then they go grab the PR person

310
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,140
and I have to talk to the PR person.

311
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,100
And then if I have questions, I have to schedule it.

312
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,160
And like, I just completely lose all access.

313
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,460
They don't, they don't want to talk about it.

314
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,620
And I think it's for liability.

315
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,780
Is this still like a business enterprise

316
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,620
sort of uncomfortability with open source?

317
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,540
Like it's okay to do the lawyers vet things,

318
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,980
but it's not our business line, it's not our core thing.

319
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,540
We don't want to talk about it.

320
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,860
Or it's a liability thing, like from the patent wars.

321
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,060
Or it could be simple things like, you know,

322
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,340
companies like Samsung work on, yes, stuff like Wayland,

323
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,060
but you look at where they put it.

324
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,380
They may be developing IVI systems

325
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,680
for large motor vehicle manufacturers.

326
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,180
And those people, those motor vehicle manufacturers

327
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,620
are probably the kind of people

328
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,300
who don't want this kind of information revealed

329
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,980
because it's so competitive, such cutthroat market.

330
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,420
They don't want some engineer

331
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,620
at the bottom of the stack at Samsung

332
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,140
revealing that there's some deal going on

333
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,580
for the next generation infotainment system

334
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,780
in their new car that's not even out yet.

335
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
Have you run into this working, you know,

336
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,220
through Canonical? Yeah, totally.

337
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,220
Yeah, it's frustrating, isn't it?

338
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,140
Yep.

339
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,940
All right, well, I've said my piece.

340
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,940
And so, yeah, it's, but going,

341
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,500
what you said that made me think about this is like,

342
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,700
we don't really have a great window

343
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,020
into what their contributions were.

344
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,500
So how do we quantify what the loss is?

345
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,340
Yeah, exactly.

346
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,820
Like we have an idea by, oh, well,

347
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,380
here's a percentage of code contributions

348
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,220
to the Linux kernel.

349
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,940
That seems valuable, but it doesn't really tell me what.

350
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,860
Is it support for some stupid vibrator

351
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,140
in a Samsung phone somewhere?

352
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,100
I mean, is that what that,

353
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,900
was that what that kernel contribution was?

354
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,740
Or was it to make it possible for Wayland

355
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,140
to render the Firefox pop-up on a very different scale?

356
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,660
There's way more development that happens

357
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,540
outside of the Linux kernel as well,

358
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,100
that, you know, revolves around hardware enablement

359
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,940
and what have you.

360
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,700
Yeah, yeah, boy, there's,

361
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,180
we could do a whole episode on that, really.

362
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,380
It's a fascinating world.

363
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,300
I got some insight into that when I was down at Dell

364
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,500
and I was watching how they work upstream

365
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,300
with different hardware OEMs and yeah,

366
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,420
it's fascinating stuff.

367
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,420
But I'd like to take a moment

368
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,740
and talk about some rapid pace development around Proton.

369
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,780
You can now play 2,600 Windows games on Linux

370
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,900
via that Steam Play, which is using Proton underneath.

371
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,780
That is, that is massive.

372
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,620
That is a huge accomplishment.

373
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,700
And along with this, kind of an addendum to this,

374
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,860
is the launch of ProtonDB at Protondb.com.

375
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,500
I'd like you guys just to know about this.

376
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,620
You may remember when we first talked

377
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,180
about Steam Play on this show,

378
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,500
I mentioned there was a Google Docs spreadsheet

379
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,380
that was keeping track of the games that was compatible.

380
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,220
Oh yeah, right.

381
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,340
Well, that's now developed into Protondb.com.

382
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:13,340
And it got so popular they basically broke Google Docs.

383
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,980
For a while they were just breaking Google Docs.

384
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,580
It was pretty funny.

385
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,460
So they have all kinds of compatibility reports

386
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,220
and whatnot, and to celebrate the.com launch,

387
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,020
they're also redesigning the look of the overall database.

388
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,620
Like they're making it look really nice.

389
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,860
Get the initial data reports in there

390
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,900
so it's easier for people to see

391
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,180
what the compatibility expectations are.

392
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,780
And it's sort of remarkable to me.

393
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,700
Oh, there's some good games in here too.

394
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,220
I mean, gosh, classics to modern stuff.

395
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,020
Like it's all over the map.

396
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,460
Yeah, it's remarkable to me that they've gone

397
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,740
to 2,500 games and this community

398
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,260
that looks almost like it's a commercial venture.

399
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,420
Like this site, this Protondb site.

400
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,260
It's well made, yeah.

401
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,180
It's branded pretty nicely, it doesn't look bad.

402
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,780
18,459 compatibility reports in this database

403
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,140
for those 2,000 games.

404
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,780
So it's the year of the Linux gaming desktop.

405
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,340
And just to circle back again on another topic

406
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,740
is I've now gotten multiple confirmations.

407
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,540
And aren't you one of them actually?

408
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,140
People in the Google Stream beta,

409
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,140
like the streaming video games under GNU slash Linux.

410
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,540
Hey, it's happening.

411
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,940
15 megabits is like the absolute minimum

412
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,540
it's gonna work with something around there.

413
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,980
And you have to have like less than 5% packet loss

414
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,980
and less than 1% is recommended.

415
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,460
And for a while it wanted you to have

416
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,420
an external controller to plug in as well.

417
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,620
I don't know if that's still true.

418
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,900
I don't know, I don't think so, actually.

419
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,140
It sounds like it's not.

420
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,980
So you combine that streaming system with Proton.

421
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,900
It's a really good time to be a hardcore gamer

422
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:46,740
like Wimpy.

423
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,980
I mean, Wimpy's a hardcore gamer.

424
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,820
Hardcore.

425
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,140
I'm just pretty excited.

426
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,660
Have you tried any of these Wimpy

427
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,980
with all the travels you've been doing?

428
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,420
Have you had a chance to try the Proton thing out?

429
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,580
Not while I've been traveling, but at home I have.

430
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,260
I've invested in probably more than a dozen racing games

431
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,860
that were originally launched for Windows.

432
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,780
And some of the ones I enjoyed on the PS3 years ago,

433
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,660
some of the Need for Speed series.

434
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,340
And I'm playing those quite happily now on my Linux desktop.

435
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,820
Also, I have a question for you.

436
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,660
I thought I saw you on Twitter posting pictures of a ThinkPad,

437
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,700
but I thought you got a new XPS or a new Dell 15.

438
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,380
I went with ThinkPad in the end.

439
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,900
Yeah, so I have the ThinkPad now.

440
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,980
No, really?

441
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,900
That bald Serp he would, gosh.

442
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,100
Yeah, and how has it been?

443
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,580
Have you had much of a chance to play with it?

444
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,900
I'm using it right now.

445
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,220
And you upgraded, what was it, the RAM and the drive

446
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,460
in that thing?

447
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,100
Well, I couldn't upgrade the RAM post-market

448
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,940
because only major OEMs can actually get the 32 gig DIMMs.

449
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,740
So that delayed the order, in fact.

450
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,260
Oh, wow.

451
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,900
So I think I may have been the first person

452
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,300
to actually order one of these with 64 gigs of RAM.

453
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:58,820
Oh.

454
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,460
Oh.

455
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,180
What are you doing to us?

456
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,420
Yeah, but so I couldn't source those after market.

457
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,580
So I had to get it ordered with that.

458
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,300
But I ordered it with the cheapest SSD option,

459
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,900
which was a 256 gig SSD.

460
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,980
And then purchased some 970 EVOs, a 512 and a 2 terabytes.

461
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,380
So two drives.

462
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:22,940
Yeah.

463
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,260
So I've left Windows on the drive it came with,

464
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,940
put the two new drives in, and I've

465
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,540
got a 500 gig boot partition and a 2 terabyte home partition.

466
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,260
Oh, my gosh.

467
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,660
What do you need 2 terabytes?

468
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,380
Is that for VMs, for home drives?

469
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,180
Think about how many electron amps he runs?

470
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,340
It's for all the code that I work on and all of the VMs.

471
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,060
Just copies of data.

472
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,940
Just stuff.

473
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,420
This is a five year machine, at least.

474
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,460
Yeah, I think so.

475
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,940
In fact, since I've had it for a few days

476
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,500
now, because I've still got back at the weekend

477
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,340
and it had arrived whilst I'd been away,

478
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,100
and I've decided to go all in with this.

479
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,180
So I've actually ordered the Thunderbolt docking

480
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,460
station for it.

481
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,300
And I'm going to set that up and actually use

482
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,020
this as not just my laptop, but my main workstation for work.

483
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,860
So I will plug it into the Thunderbolt dock, which

484
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,900
connects to the screens and everything else.

485
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,700
Have you decided which Thunderbolt dock

486
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,420
you're going with, because I've been

487
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,900
considering doing the same thing?

488
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,660
Yeah, there's a new one that Lenovo have released.

489
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,980
Oh, really?

490
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,020
Yeah, that has an adapter that connects alongside the power.

491
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,820
So the power adapter in the laptop

492
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,740
is next to one of the Thunderbolt ports.

493
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,940
And they've made a cable, which connects to both of those

494
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,380
in one connector.

495
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,620
Do you have a link?

496
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,540
That's it right there.

497
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,260
That's what I want.

498
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,660
Yeah, I can look one up and send it over to you.

499
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,260
This is great.

500
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,020
So does this mean if you're switching away

501
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,220
from the Dell to the ThinkPad, I'm

502
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,060
not going to be looking up your nose whenever

503
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,660
we're having video chats?

504
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,820
This is true.

505
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,700
In fact, it sounds ridiculous, right?

506
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,180
But the placement of the webcam was actually

507
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,260
a serious consideration in all of this,

508
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,340
and I would say was actually the clinching feature that

509
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,340
took me over the edge.

510
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,100
Because everyone talks about how small the Dell bezels are,

511
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,500
but the bezels on this are also very small, too.

512
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,820
Yeah.

513
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,740
Apple announced a new MacBook with small bezels today.

514
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,280
And one of the things they specifically

515
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,100
took time in the announcement to call out

516
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,540
was that they had placed the camera at the top of the screen

517
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,460
because people care about that kind of thing.

518
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,260
And I completely agree.

519
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,380
I do Zoom meetings a lot now, a lot of Zoom meetings.

520
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,580
And their whole video, everybody's looking at my face.

521
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,540
So that was an issue when I was reviewing the Precision.

522
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,300
Or I'm sorry, when I was using the XPS,

523
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,020
and the Precision has the same thing.

524
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,740
So you wouldn't want to just carry around a little C920

525
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,580
or whatever?

526
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,740
No, no way.

527
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,580
No, I don't think so.

528
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,740
But what if you already have to live the Dell Go lifestyle?

529
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,020
You've already got your little Go bag.

530
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,340
No, because the cord's not good.

531
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,340
It's long.

532
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,620
Well, congratulations, Wimpy.

533
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,060
This one's got a mini RJ45 port in it,

534
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,180
which is a proper Gigabit Ethernet port.

535
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,740
And it has a little stub that expands that

536
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,020
into a regular RJ45.

537
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,860
So it has proper Ethernet on it as well.

538
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,260
And it's got USB-A and USB-C ports on it,

539
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,780
and HDMI ports and head jack ports.

540
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,420
It's got plenty of I.O.

541
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,900
This is a serious, this is a serious dock.

542
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,260
This is not cheap, but it's really nice.

543
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,860
Yeah, there's a version of that that's

544
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,060
more expensive that's got an NVIDIA graphics card in it

545
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,580
as well.

546
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,180
Oh, was I not just talking about that?

547
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,020
You just were.

548
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,380
Before we started going on there,

549
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,540
I was like, you know what would be really nice?

550
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,700
Is to do an eGPU Thunderbolt dock.

551
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,700
Yeah, well, I don't need that because I've already

552
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
got the eGPU.

553
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,220
So I'm just getting the one that's, you know,

554
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,700
connect all of your stuff up.

555
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,780
Yeah.

556
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,500
Oh, man.

557
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,460
Well, I'll be curious to hear your thoughts on how

558
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,220
the dock works out, because I think I want to pick one up,

559
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:42,900
too.

560
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,700
So I may live vicariously through you for a bit.

561
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,540
Well, speaking of new hardware, our friends at System76

562
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,540
have been teasing this Thelio system for a while.

563
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,660
And we've got some details.

564
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,260
Yeah, OK, so they're not actually

565
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,460
going to announce it until, well, November 1.

566
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,580
So it's soon, but you don't have to wait that long.

567
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,020
They're calling them open hardware systems.

568
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,940
And in theory, they're shipping in December.

569
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,040
Yeah, and so I had the fortune of Carl

570
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,380
willing to be able to stay up late and email exchange

571
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,780
with me last night to answer some of my questions

572
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,540
about what do they mean by open hardware,

573
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,820
where's the innovation here, what's different about this.

574
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,820
And so I got some insight into that.

575
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,660
And I think the first thing I want to clarify

576
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,300
is what makes Thelio open hardware, because that's,

577
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,500
I think, a big question here.

578
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,340
And according to them, Thelio's design

579
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,540
that they've been working on for more than three years now

580
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,940
is completely open source.

581
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,460
Anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell

582
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,820
the design of the hardware.

583
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,420
I'll get into that again in a second.

584
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,040
I'll come back to that.

585
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,580
But another part that I think is maybe

586
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,820
the part that's more interesting to the audience is,

587
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,180
he writes in a blog post, to further our open computer

588
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,420
ambition, we are working to remove functionality

589
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,940
from the proprietary main board, like the motherboard.

590
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,300
To that end, we've designed Thelio IO,

591
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,460
a daughter board that manages thermal and chassis control,

592
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,260
also providing storage backplane for the drives in Thelio.

593
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
So they've got this daughter board system where

594
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,860
they're going to be moving the proprietary functionality.

595
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,100
I see.

596
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,780
So all of your little proprietary blobs

597
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,420
or chipsets that need them, black boxes,

598
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,220
that's on one board, then just standard more open components

599
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,020
can be on the actual main board.

600
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,260
Yeah, exactly.

601
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,260
So I had an email thread back and forth with Carl.

602
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,620
And this machine, first of all, they're

603
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,520
going to have three SKUs of it, essentially,

604
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,540
like big, bigger, and massive.

605
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,740
And they're going to be desktop x86 workstations

606
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,660
with a ton of horsepower.

607
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,640
Like beefy.

608
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,100
The thing they're doing that is hard to describe in audio,

609
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,580
but when you see it in pictures, looks really sharp,

610
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,100
is they've worked on this custom case design

611
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,780
that even the back end of it's beautiful.

612
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,660
Like it's just really clean.

613
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,980
But it is a combination of brushed metal

614
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,100
with like a metal powder coated finishing.

615
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,980
Oh, yeah, premium.

616
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,860
Really nice.

617
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,540
And wood.

618
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,460
Wait, wood?

619
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:13,980
And wood.

620
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,900
So like maples in there, and it looks really

621
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,580
like it's got this beautiful contrast

622
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,420
when the black and the maple wood.

623
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,300
And there's no seams, like no bumps.

624
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,140
This sounds like a premium desktop.

625
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,980
It looks really good.

626
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,140
So this one goes on the desk, not under the desk.

627
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,940
Yeah, it looks really good.

628
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,740
I won't share all the details, but what I did get to see,

629
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,740
and what I did learn about it, it

630
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,420
looks like a killer Linux desktop, just something

631
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,980
that they've put probably more effort into than I think

632
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,860
they've ever put into any other product.

633
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,980
And it's a big commitment, because this

634
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,340
is the first thing they're making in this new factory,

635
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,220
is this.

636
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,780
Is that right?

637
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,220
OK.

638
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,900
And then he says long term.

639
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,020
So this is the testing ground.

640
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,300
Yeah, long term, their goal is to work

641
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,860
to try to open the rest of the hardware in the machine.

642
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,140
Right, because right now it sounds like open hardware

643
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,500
kind of means open specs.

644
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,540
Like here's how you put all these proprietary parts

645
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:09,220
together, and with some effort made to use less of them.

646
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,740
I can tell Carl's really excited about it,

647
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,020
and he got me excited about it.

648
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,780
I would say after I read his description of the machine,

649
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,900
it exceeded what my expectations were of what

650
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,340
they would be working on.

651
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,100
And we have pretty soon, November 1st, that's pretty soon.

652
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,140
Right around the corner.

653
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,220
So we'll find out more about it.

654
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,580
And I might get a chance to fly out there and see it in person

655
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,900
too before it's shipping.

656
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,380
But if I was in the market for a Linux desktop right now,

657
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,860
I would 100% wait until November 1st.

658
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,980
Yeah, so to keep your eyes on.

659
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,180
Because just the cases alone look gorgeous.

660
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,340
And then the hardware they're putting in this thing

661
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,380
is pretty top end.

662
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,140
It's pretty top end hardware, and the prices

663
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,420
are pretty reasonable.

664
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,780
So if you're in the market, I would definitely

665
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,020
be waiting for a Linux desktop right now.

666
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,220
I love that idea of a really powerful Linux

667
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,780
desktop and a nice, light, portable laptop to go with it.

668
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,700
Yeah, I did get a little peek.

669
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,300
I got a little peek at the machine.

670
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,780
She's baking.

671
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,260
She's baking in the chat room asking

672
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,380
if I got to see a little.

673
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,300
And yeah, this is going to be big for them.

674
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,420
And you can tell that he's really passionate about it,

675
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,220
because he's taking the time, Colorado time,

676
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,220
to chat with me at night, where I'm in the Pacific time zone.

677
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,140
It's nighttime for me.

678
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,660
Yeah, right.

679
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,900
That's some real user, real creator evangelism right there.

680
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,060
Yeah, and he's talking about it in ways you can really

681
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,260
tell he's very proud of it.

682
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,220
And it does, the pictures I got to see are really sharp.

683
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,220
I think when you guys get to see it,

684
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,660
you're going to get to see even more than I got

685
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,700
to see when it does go public, because I think you're

686
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,900
going to be pretty impressed.

687
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,460
So yeah, the Thelio hype is real.

688
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,900
Some people are hoping it's a RISC-V system that

689
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,260
would be totally open.

690
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,580
It isn't like that.

691
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,780
But I think their innovation here

692
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,340
is this daughter board system.

693
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,300
I mean, it's probably a good thing, right?

694
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,620
We don't want them to bite off more than they can chew and fail.

695
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,900
It's probably better to go in small incremental steps.

696
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,260
They'll get their new facilities up and running.

697
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,900
They'll get this guy going, provide more revenue for them

698
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,300
to work on, slowly building up these relationships,

699
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,140
and hopefully freeing more of it.

700
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,500
Make for a great Plasma workstation.

701
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,020
Oh, yeah.

702
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,860
That's what I'm saying.

703
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,860
Frequent virtual lug contributor and friend of the show, Alex,

704
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,300
had reached a major milestone himself recently.

705
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,180
His project, Linux Server IO, his project and the team

706
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,340
over there just passed one billion total

707
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,140
polls from Docker Hub.

708
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,460
One billion polls.

709
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,580
So congratulations to Linux Server IO.

710
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,180
I've actually, before I even knew Alex,

711
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,380
I bumped into Linux Server IO a couple of times,

712
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,900
just pulling down, I think it was like an NZB client

713
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,940
or something I was pulling off of Docker Hub.

714
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,180
There was a lot of popular software packaged up by them.

715
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,700
Yeah.

716
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,660
A billion.

717
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,540
That really shows you the size and scale of Docker Hub.

718
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,980
When you can start a project like this

719
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,500
and you package up applications that

720
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,380
have been packaged many a time before in various formats,

721
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,940
and you put it up on Docker Hub and it

722
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,620
gets a billion, a billion downloads.

723
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,780
Over a billion.

724
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,340
So congratulations to them.

725
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,940
Yeah, there's a lot of hard work, some good insights there.

726
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,220
Go check that out and then go use some of their,

727
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,180
some cool applications you can run easily.

728
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,460
It's a great mix because you can throw it up

729
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,820
on your own machine, a laptop, or a VPS

730
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,820
and try out something that's all packaged up and ready to go.

731
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,940
And you can at least see if you like it

732
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,580
and then go build it yourself if you want

733
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,980
or stick with the image.

734
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,380
All right.

735
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,940
We got to do something because this next story.

736
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,820
How do we get there?

737
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,980
We've got to talk about this.

738
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,540
The inescapable story of the week.

739
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,700
I don't think I'd ever be ready.

740
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,940
I think that's it.

741
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,540
There's never going to be a point in which I am ready to talk.

742
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,460
We're still in shock.

743
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:27,660
All right.

744
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,100
I got one.

745
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,660
I got something.

746
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,260
OK, Wes.

747
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,260
I'm going to give you a little quiz.

748
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:30,740
Are you ready?

749
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,220
Oh, oh.

750
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,060
OK.

751
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,900
OK.

752
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,380
Mr. Payne, see if you can guess the project.

753
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,020
With 80 components tracked, 55 of those components

754
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,660
at 100% completion, and many other components

755
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:50,220
with significant progress, what beloved open source project

756
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,260
is near 80% done for its next major version?

757
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,180
Well, I was about to guess Linux Mint,

758
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,500
but it sounds like I don't know if that's there.

759
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,420
Spoiler.

760
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,580
No, you can't do that one.

761
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:02,820
OK.

762
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,380
Well, you said open source, so it's not Duke Nukem forever,

763
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,260
despite all of our hopes.

764
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:07,740
You ready?

765
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,580
You got a guess?

766
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,380
What could it be?

767
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,380
There's just so many good options.

768
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,140
OK, I'm just going to say that it's

769
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,540
got to be the next GNOME release.

770
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,620
Oh, you're close.

771
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,140
You're close.

772
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:25,220
So with 80 components tracked, 55 at 100% completion,

773
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:33,140
and many others with significant progress, XFCE 4.14 is 80% done.

774
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,220
And they've just updated the roadmap.

775
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,860
It's time for one last big push, and then you're

776
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,260
going to get new XFCE goodness.

777
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:39,780
Hey, yo.

778
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,420
After this long, long wait.

779
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,660
That story was really for one member of our audience,

780
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,540
and that's our editor.

781
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,060
And now it is time for us to actually get to it.

782
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,460
We got to keep him happy.

783
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,420
Yeah, it's contractually obligated for us

784
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,900
to talk about XFCE once every quarter.

785
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,860
All right, so on Sunday, IBM and Red Hat

786
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,540
announced that IBM would be purchasing Red Hat

787
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,860
and becoming the world's, as they put it, number one

788
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,260
hybrid cloud provider, which is pretty easy when

789
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,340
you're making up a term.

790
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:16,380
Red Hat is being purchased for $34 billion.

791
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,260
That's over 60% of their value on Friday

792
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,420
when the stock market closed.

793
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,620
And today, after the news has had time to hit the market,

794
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,740
depending on when you check it, obviously, these things

795
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,740
are going to come and go.

796
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,220
But when we checked it, Red Hat's stock

797
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,420
was up, I think, 34% on the news.

798
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,100
No, 45% on the news.

799
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,180
Damn.

800
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,380
What?

801
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,140
45%.

802
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,220
Damn.

803
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,820
This is one of those stories that you didn't ever really

804
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,660
expect.

805
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,500
In all fairness.

806
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,580
You probably don't think that much about IBM,

807
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,740
unless you're an enterprise, right?

808
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,860
You don't talk about it.

809
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,860
Fair, fair point.

810
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,380
And two, I just sort of assumed Red Hat wasn't for sale.

811
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,300
I guess I've been struggling with this in a way that

812
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,500
felt really personal to me, because I'm not

813
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,220
a Red Hat employee.

814
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,260
I'm not even a Red Hat user.

815
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,100
In fact, I don't even like using RHEL.

816
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,220
For some reason, though, I felt a really personal struggle

817
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,340
with this one.

818
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:23,500
And I think part of that is I feel

819
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:30,300
like the great wars of the late 90s, early 2000s

820
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,820
were for nothing.

821
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,300
What was it all for?

822
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:38,260
Because in 2018, Microsoft is one of the key open source

823
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,820
contributors and now owns GitHub officially.

824
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,980
That's gone through as of Monday.

825
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:48,700
And the star rebel, the shining open source revenue generator,

826
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,900
Red Hat, is now owned by an establishment company,

827
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,020
or is going to be, IBM.

828
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,500
All of our trailblazing and cause fighting,

829
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,020
we went through so much.

830
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,300
In the 90s, Microsoft was so dominant.

831
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,060
And by the late 90s and early 2000s,

832
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,260
we had all of these projects.

833
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,500
We had Wine and Mono and all of these attempts

834
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,420
to just coexist in a world that was dominated by Microsoft.

835
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,060
And we finally get through all of that.

836
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,380
And we look back at it, what was it all for?

837
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,780
And I feel the same way with Red Hat being bought by IBM.

838
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,020
I thought they would be the ones buying IBM.

839
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,860
I thought they would be the ones buying Amazon,

840
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,940
not the other way around.

841
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,220
That's not the way I saw it going down.

842
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,260
So I just, I don't know, the old man in me

843
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,460
just really sort of took it hard a little bit.

844
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,820
Isn't this something, though, that we always

845
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,660
had to be aware of?

846
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,700
I mean, it's kind of like using a proprietary service,

847
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,300
where you've said it many times, right?

848
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,460
Like, you use it, but you know that it could go away,

849
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,020
it could change, that business could fold,

850
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,020
or they could just stop interrupting with however

851
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,020
you like using it.

852
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,300
And I mean, for as long as Red Hat's been public,

853
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,420
it's a for-profit corporation.

854
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,500
They may have a culture that really likes open source,

855
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,940
but that's not why it exists.

856
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,660
Right, and as Red Hat will tell you,

857
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,060
they don't have any intellectual property.

858
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,300
They have staff, and they give away all their software.

859
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,900
They have been a services company for a very long time.

860
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,580
They were one of the early services companies.

861
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,780
That's what they make their money on,

862
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,220
is the services around the open source software

863
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,500
that they sell, and in some cases,

864
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,940
the closed source software they sell.

865
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,460
They have been more like IBM for a very long time

866
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,140
than we'd like to acknowledge,

867
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,580
because we like to look at the things that they do

868
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,940
that feel like the open source fairy

869
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,020
delivering us great software.

870
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,740
You know, we get things like Network Manager,

871
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,100
and we get things like Pulse Audio, and System D,

872
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,500
and PipeWire, which we just recently talked about,

873
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,220
and so many other fundamental technologies,

874
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,540
Flatpak, et cetera, et cetera,

875
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,980
that don't really seem to have a direct cloud angle,

876
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,620
don't have a direct services industry angle,

877
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,100
but yet are extremely useful and beneficial

878
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
to all Linux distributions,

879
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,940
and that's the thing that we like to talk about.

880
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,740
That's how we like to look at Red Hat in that light,

881
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,860
but the reality is Red Hat is a for-profit public company

882
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,660
who makes money selling services,

883
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,460
much more like IBM than we'd like to admit,

884
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,700
but it still was shocking to see it.

885
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,220
Like I said, I think I always expected

886
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,660
that Red Hat wasn't for sale,

887
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,300
and that they would be the ones doing the buying one day.

888
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,580
Right, they'd been our juggernaut.

889
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,420
They were the ones like, look, Linux can make money.

890
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,860
The services open source model, it can make money.

891
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,700
It makes sense.

892
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,900
These are good philosophies to build a company on,

893
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,820
and obviously that's still true,

894
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,820
but they obviously had a little bit of a special culture too,

895
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,260
and how much of that can stay, will stay, we just don't know.

896
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,500
But the big difference between IBM and Red Hat, I think,

897
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,900
is that, I mean, how much does IBM

898
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,220
really give back to the community,

899
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,820
whereas Red Hat seriously has multiple full-time employees.

900
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,020
They have two or three that work for the GNOME Foundation.

901
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,020
They have others that work on other projects.

902
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,420
Some people have been hired by Red Hat

903
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,700
just to keep working on those essential applications

904
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,220
that we need.

905
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,220
Yeah, it's hard to really think

906
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,260
of what major contributions IBM has made

907
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,940
to the industry in general recently.

908
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,140
Well, I think it is another case

909
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,260
that we kind of talked about before,

910
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,660
where they do have a lot of contributions

911
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,260
to open source in their history, in a broad manner,

912
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,260
but they don't talk about it, right?

913
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,300
Red Hat talked about it.

914
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,780
It was a big thing that they did.

915
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,100
The people they employed were very prominent

916
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,420
in the community, and so it is right,

917
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,420
they have both a decent history of open source contribution,

918
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,740
but they don't do it in the same way.

919
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,460
They don't exactly have the same attitude,

920
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,780
and they don't spend all their time talking about it,

921
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,780
especially from like the business executive side.

922
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,020
Right, that's a big part of Red Hat's branding,

923
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,980
is Jim Whitehurst, open culture, open source.

924
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,980
He wrote a book about it.

925
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,340
They talk about it at the very top,

926
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,420
whereas IBM, it's like an implementation detail.

927
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,260
Exactly.

928
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,340
Okay, so you know, when I first saw this news too,

929
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,620
the first question that I tried to frame all of this in

930
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:54,180
was is it possible that the new owner

931
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,540
could be a better owner of what Red Hat has,

932
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,740
like Red Hat's properties?

933
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:03,100
Can they be, could IBM be a better owner of those things?

934
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,300
Can IBM be a better owner?

935
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,900
Can they own this stack better than Red Hat can?

936
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,460
I don't know, I don't know,

937
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,020
but I think the one thing that I did recall

938
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:18,020
is that a long time ago, like back in 2000, 2001,

939
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,940
IBM made a hard play into Linux.

940
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,660
They just made this abrupt turn,

941
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,420
and they announced a billion dollar investment in Linux,

942
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:31,420
and they hired a whole crew to film these Linux commercials.

943
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,660
Oh yeah.

944
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,620
And one of my favorite had Captain Cisco in it.

945
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,500
1991 Helsinki, a 21 year old student named Linus Torvalds

946
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,660
writes a new computer operating system.

947
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,460
He calls it Linux, then does something revolutionary.

948
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,260
He gives it away free over the internet.

949
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,300
The powers that be dismiss him as an eccentric, a freak,

950
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,740
but everywhere coders and free thinkers embrace Linux,

951
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,180
improve and refine it.

952
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,380
Now the forces of openness have a powerful

953
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,420
and unexpected new ally.

954
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,620
It's a different kind of world.

955
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,460
You need a different kind of software.

956
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,580
That IBM went away for a while,

957
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,860
and they became a services sales company.

958
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,180
And I wonder if we're seeing IBM return to that.

959
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,140
That is what I hope is happening.

960
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,820
I mean, they've done a lot of good stuff, right?

961
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,340
A lot of good engineering work has come out of them.

962
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,300
And you're right, they haven't really kept up.

963
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,620
Maybe a question is, can you do that?

964
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,860
How much can new blood be injected into a company?

965
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,620
Is this really gonna change things?

966
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,420
What is their capacity for change?

967
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,300
I have heard from more than five, less than 10.

968
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,540
I'll just put it that way.

969
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,260
Red Hat employees now who are very not happy.

970
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,660
They are very not happy.

971
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,460
I would say panic and disparity is the tone.

972
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,540
Interestingly enough, I've also heard from people

973
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,780
who do not work at Red Hat,

974
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,020
but know people really well who work at Red Hat,

975
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,420
and they say they're pumped.

976
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,180
So there is some people inside that are very excited.

977
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,540
But the people I heard about,

978
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,060
they're primarily concerned about things

979
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,940
like they have this memo list internally

980
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,620
that it's a very expose kind of thing.

981
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,260
They're worried that's gonna get shut down.

982
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,460
They have a very unique culture.

983
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,820
They're worried that that's gonna get shut down.

984
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,300
Right, that seems like a lot that can be difficult.

985
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,140
Yeah.

986
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:15,380
So there's, internally, the theme sort of is,

987
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,540
I work at Red Hat because this is Red Hat.

988
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,940
And I am passionate about open source.

989
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,620
And I wanted to work somewhere

990
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,220
where my open source software would ship to end users

991
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,140
and make a difference.

992
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,580
And that's why I'm at Red Hat.

993
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,900
Because it's Red Hat, not because it's IBM.

994
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,460
And the thing that Jim Whitehurst knows very well

995
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,660
is Red Hat's real value is the software developers.

996
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,500
That's the talent.

997
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,300
Their engineers are their most valuable asset.

998
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,500
Because everything else is free, for the most part.

999
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,540
All of their source code stuff, it's free.

1000
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,100
The source RPMs that they still, you know.

1001
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,940
Yep, yeah.

1002
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,780
That is free.

1003
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,580
And so the developers are their real talent.

1004
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,700
And if they leave because it's no longer Red Hat,

1005
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,780
then this deal loses a ton of its value.

1006
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,460
A couple of other interesting things I have grok'd

1007
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,620
from my conversations with friends

1008
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,100
is the way this is being sold to the staff right now

1009
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,500
is the reason Red Hat won't change.

1010
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,940
The reason why Red Hat will remain

1011
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,700
its own independent entity within IBM

1012
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,980
is because that is the true value of Red Hat.

1013
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,820
The way they phrase it is,

1014
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,820
Red Hat needs to remain Switzerland.

1015
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,860
Red Hat has to be this independent,

1016
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:26,100
non-vendor, lock-in, neutral platform

1017
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:30,220
that IBM sales teams can go to these high-end clients

1018
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,700
and sell a solution that doesn't have, quote,

1019
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,420
vendor lock-in.

1020
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,460
So the way IBM CEO frames this,

1021
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,100
she says that essentially they have clients

1022
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,700
that are so big it would blow your mind.

1023
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,740
The greatest clients ever.

1024
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,940
They're the best clients.

1025
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,940
And that 80% of their workload is not yet in the cloud.

1026
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,220
See, that first 20% that's in the cloud

1027
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,260
was all the easy stuff.

1028
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,060
The stuff that's, quote, cloud native.

1029
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,900
But now, now it's time for hybrid cloud.

1030
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,180
And this is what she says.

1031
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:04,180
Hybrid cloud is gonna bridge the on-premises stuff

1032
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,940
with the things that normally, traditionally,

1033
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,180
didn't work in the cloud

1034
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,260
that are now being moved into the cloud.

1035
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,260
And Jim Whitehurst says that what IBM and Red Hat

1036
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,380
will do together is they will create

1037
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,660
the one unifying platform

1038
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,100
that bridges on-premises and cloud.

1039
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,060
And when you're gonna do this in a large capacity,

1040
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,260
this is who you go to.

1041
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,460
And these clients,

1042
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,460
the number one thing they're afraid of these days,

1043
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,100
according to IBM CEO, vendor lock-in.

1044
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,780
And so Red Hat must remain independent.

1045
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,540
Their, quote, go-to-market strategy

1046
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,020
must remain independent, end quote.

1047
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,700
And that reason is because they want to sell

1048
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,220
into competitors that IBM is currently competing

1049
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,500
in similar markets with,

1050
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,580
and they want Red Hat to still sell to them,

1051
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,060
and they want to be able to sell to large clients,

1052
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,220
quote unquote, they're afraid about vendor lock-in.

1053
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,700
So IBM can go, no, this isn't a vendor-specific solution.

1054
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,740
This is Red Hat.

1055
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,700
It's totally our solution.

1056
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,060
You're totally getting locked into us.

1057
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,940
Go ahead, deploy Red Hat.

1058
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,220
It's got Kubernetes.

1059
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,500
It's got OpenStack.

1060
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,260
It's gonna be fine.

1061
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,100
It's an interesting question too,

1062
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,260
because I think we've seen this from other things,

1063
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,220
either like larger companies like Alphabet

1064
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,980
or just different sections of Amazon,

1065
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,020
where you're like, you're selling to one hand

1066
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,220
and buying from the other.

1067
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,340
Like, how does this work?

1068
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,260
How well does it actually work?

1069
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,420
And sometimes it seems like business

1070
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,860
is pragmatic enough that it's fine.

1071
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,140
People are like, all right, yeah,

1072
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,900
install me my OpenShift cluster managed by IBM's

1073
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,940
managed services, and away I go.

1074
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,820
Today, October 30th, Mark Shuttleworth released a statement

1075
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,820
on the IBM acquisition of Red Hat.

1076
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,940
And this is great.

1077
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,860
This is, I didn't expect this.

1078
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,540
Canonical usually plays it quiet.

1079
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,940
They usually tend to default to not saying anything.

1080
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,940
Like, they just don't say it.

1081
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,220
They don't get in the mix.

1082
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,180
But this time, Mark wasn't standing still.

1083
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,900
And this isn't the first time we've seen this.

1084
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,420
I think you guys will recall, almost a year ago,

1085
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,060
we had a ZDNet article where Mark was taking some shots

1086
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,700
at Red Hat's open.

1087
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,940
Oh, yeah.

1088
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:02,340
Yeah, it was a good read.

1089
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,180
I love it.

1090
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,300
This though, this is even better.

1091
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,140
I love this.

1092
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,300
He writes in here, public sources of data on Linux trends

1093
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,940
show that we've had a clear move.

1094
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,420
And he's setting up that essentially,

1095
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,020
Red Hat has been losing market shares is his position

1096
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,620
and that they were pushed into this.

1097
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,260
He says, we salute Red Hat for the role it played

1098
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,780
in framing open sources familiar shrink wrapped replacement

1099
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,260
for additional Unix on Wintel.

1100
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,100
In that sense,

1101
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,860
RHEL was critical in the open source movement.

1102
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,980
Nevertheless, the world has moved on

1103
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,780
and replacing Unix is no longer sufficient.

1104
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,860
The decline in RHEL growth contrast with the acceleration

1105
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,940
in Linux more broadly is a strong market indicator

1106
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,220
of the next wave of open source.

1107
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,100
So what he's saying is RHEL market share decreasing,

1108
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,420
but overall Linux deployments were going up,

1109
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,740
market indicator.

1110
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,580
I think he's right.

1111
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,100
And that's what's so great about it.

1112
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,980
And then he goes into containers and whatnot,

1113
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:58,020
essentially kind of implying that IBM was able

1114
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,220
to scoop them up because of this situation

1115
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,060
that Red Hat found.

1116
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,740
The time of RHEL is past.

1117
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,660
Maybe true.

1118
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,460
Red Hat's explanation is that we just simply couldn't sell

1119
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,460
into the clients at the scale we wanted to anymore.

1120
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,460
Like we had reached the end of our sales capacity

1121
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,860
and to get to the next big fish,

1122
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,500
we had to get even bigger ourselves.

1123
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,460
That's their version of the story.

1124
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:21,020
Besides the fact that all the shareholders make buckets.

1125
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,860
Right.

1126
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,860
Which fine, that's a legit enough,

1127
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,060
you know, who would say no to that?

1128
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,340
Well, having interviewed

1129
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,260
with their consulting department recently,

1130
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,020
I can actually verify their statements

1131
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,340
about they've got customers lining up through the door

1132
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:40,900
and they just don't have the consulting staff

1133
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:45,260
to actually do the onsite implementations

1134
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,060
that they're wanting to do.

1135
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,980
So there may be some validity to that.

1136
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,940
Wall Street seems to think so.

1137
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,540
I mean, up 45%, geez, that is really something.

1138
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,340
I don't know.

1139
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,900
I'd be curious to know any old timers,

1140
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,580
what your thoughts are just in terms of,

1141
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,260
I mean, this is Red Hat.

1142
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,420
Like this is Red Hat we're talking about right here.

1143
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,700
For us old timers, this to me, it feels huge.

1144
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,820
Go beyond market strategies and things like this,

1145
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:20,300
like is there any, besides Microsoft's complicity

1146
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,340
in working with open source,

1147
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,140
is there any other major, major, major indicator

1148
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,460
we've seen that how successful free software

1149
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,500
and open source has become in the industry?

1150
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:34,580
$36 billion makes this the largest software acquisition

1151
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,140
in the history of software acquisitions.

1152
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,220
That's the largest, and it was an open source one.

1153
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:43,940
It was a company making free software.

1154
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,420
I don't think we see the same focus.

1155
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,740
Like obviously, AWS is built on a lot of free software.

1156
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,820
It's not marketed that way.

1157
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,700
That's what Red Hat was so special about, right?

1158
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,300
It was, it was not, I guess it was not technically

1159
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,460
an open source company, but it sure felt like it.

1160
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:02,460
Well, here's what gets me is that we talk about companies

1161
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,940
that have a smaller impact on the market

1162
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,940
than Canonical does.

1163
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,900
Canonical has this weird problem

1164
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,820
where like their deployments of Ubuntu

1165
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,620
are like shadow deployments.

1166
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,140
There literally could be a safe margin

1167
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,660
more Ubuntu deployments in production workloads

1168
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,860
in the world than there are RHEL deployments

1169
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,340
when you consider VPSs and containers and VMs,

1170
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,100
which the vast majority, not all,

1171
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,060
but a lot of them are Ubuntu based.

1172
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,900
And I have had specific information given to me

1173
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,660
by AWS engineers who tell me that the majority

1174
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,300
of the Linux instances on AWS are also Ubuntu.

1175
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,260
And I've heard the same thing

1176
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,580
from Microsoft employees about Azure.

1177
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,740
They don't like to release this information publicly.

1178
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,780
So you just have to trust me.

1179
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:52,980
I'm sorry, I can't link to anything,

1180
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,940
but this is what they've told me

1181
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,620
is that they're Ubuntu based.

1182
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,980
And yet we talk about Ubuntu

1183
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,340
as if it is in another tier from Red Hat,

1184
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,180
as if it's along the same deployment scale of Fedora

1185
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,620
or Mint or elementary OS.

1186
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,860
But in reality, it has tens of millions more deployments

1187
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,260
because of the container and VPS craze.

1188
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,180
Well, I think part of it too

1189
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,060
is like RHEL means Red Hat, right?

1190
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,940
Ubuntu kind of just means Linux.

1191
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,020
Like it's just, it's Ubuntu Linux

1192
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,580
and you got it because it was an easy to use.

1193
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,420
It was already there.

1194
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,500
It might've been the default,

1195
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,620
but you didn't have to talk to Canonical.

1196
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,420
You don't even, you might not even know who Canonical is.

1197
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,780
You just know about Ubuntu.

1198
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,980
Unless you're buying managed services.

1199
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,060
I was having a conversation

1200
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,980
with some of the leadership at Linux Academy

1201
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,380
talking about beefing up the Ubuntu courseware

1202
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,220
at Linux Academy.

1203
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,300
And it's something they're interested in doing,

1204
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,420
but they have zero student data showing,

1205
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,820
I shouldn't say zero,

1206
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,620
but they have less student demand for Ubuntu

1207
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,420
than they have for Kali Linux right now.

1208
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,340
And I know that just simply is incongruent

1209
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,020
with the market share of Ubuntu.

1210
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,460
And the way we talk about Ubuntu

1211
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,900
is incongruent with the market share of Ubuntu.

1212
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,340
And the way the tech industry,

1213
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,300
we talk more about Fitbit and Netflix

1214
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,300
than we talk about Canonical.

1215
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,260
Meanwhile, Canonical's running all of this stuff

1216
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,260
that these companies are using.

1217
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,700
It's really, it's a bizarre thing.

1218
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,900
And so the other thing that really sort of landed hard on me

1219
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,300
is does this mean Canonical is next?

1220
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,500
Is Microsoft now going shit?

1221
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,460
Well, Azure is powered by,

1222
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:18,460
I mean like 30, 40% of the rigs on here are Ubuntu based.

1223
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,460
Can we afford for one of our competitors to control this?

1224
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,300
Right.

1225
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,300
Right.

1226
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,580
And I wonder if there wasn't a bidding war

1227
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,540
going on for Red Hat.

1228
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,780
The way this news came out,

1229
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,300
the way it came out on a Sunday,

1230
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,620
it was leaked and then they had to confirm it

1231
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,540
before they could even tell their own staff.

1232
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,940
It makes you wonder if there was another company

1233
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,500
involved in the bidding process for Red Hat.

1234
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,580
And this is all my way of saying

1235
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,060
we have major shifts still ahead of us.

1236
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,060
Like when you look,

1237
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,060
there are certain shifts happening in the industry

1238
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,740
because now of the success of open source.

1239
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,980
And this is the result of that success.

1240
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,820
Right.

1241
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,380
We can't ignore that like for it to be successful

1242
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,740
means it's used by big companies

1243
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,220
and they have different ideas

1244
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,260
of what they want to do with that technology.

1245
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,380
To me, it also underscores like,

1246
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,940
it's still important that we have

1247
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,460
some non-commercial distributions,

1248
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,460
like things like Debian or Arch

1249
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:10,860
that like maybe I don't run them on my server.

1250
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,580
I mean, I have certainly in both cases,

1251
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,060
but they're there and that is a thing that keeps,

1252
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,380
I think like keeps the community focused a little bit,

1253
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,340
or at least like that's our fallback.

1254
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,620
So Brandon just joined,

1255
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,220
but I don't know if he's at his mic

1256
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,900
and I'm going to steal his thunder a little bit maybe.

1257
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,540
I want to propose kind of an alternate reality

1258
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,980
to this merger.

1259
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,540
Brandon and I were talking the other day

1260
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:36,900
when this happened about an article

1261
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,940
that was posted about maybe IBM bought Red Hat

1262
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,220
and Red Hat takes over IBM.

1263
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:47,580
So instead of this being the corporatizing of Red Hat,

1264
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,620
not sure if that's a word, but it is now.

1265
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:54,820
Instead, Jim becomes the new CEO of IBM

1266
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,460
in the next couple of years

1267
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,260
and Red Hat's culture overwhelms that of IBM.

1268
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,980
And now, you know, open source takes over from the inside.

1269
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:06,300
I mean, I like that idea.

1270
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,500
300,000 employees though, it's pretty,

1271
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,380
it feels like a drop in the ocean.

1272
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,780
It's one department within a massive entity.

1273
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,620
I think that in reality, it'll be somewhere in between.

1274
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:20,900
I'm hoping for best case scenarios

1275
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,500
that it will be like Microsoft and LinkedIn.

1276
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,060
If you didn't know the business behind it,

1277
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,340
you wouldn't know that Microsoft owns LinkedIn.

1278
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,300
And I think that's kind of based on the articles

1279
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,900
that I've read.

1280
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,980
I think that's kind of what IBM wants to do with Red Hat

1281
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,820
because they're supposed to be

1282
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,220
an autonomous subsidiary of IBM.

1283
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,180
That's what they say.

1284
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,980
You know, but you think about this.

1285
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,860
I mean, really IBM has been around in one form or another

1286
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:49,140
since the early 1900s, 1911.

1287
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,620
They weren't called International Business Machines

1288
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,740
until 1924.

1289
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,580
But I mean, we're talking,

1290
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,700
these guys have been around since the world wars.

1291
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,340
And the idea that a division of a company

1292
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,980
that has been around for nearly a hundred years

1293
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:10,020
will change the culture is optimistic.

1294
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,140
It is definitely optimistic.

1295
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,820
I'm hopeful though.

1296
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,380
If nothing else, maybe they could use them as a steward.

1297
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,820
Like IBM trying to navigate a new world

1298
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,260
and a new technology landscape could defer

1299
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,500
to Red Hat's expertise in certain areas.

1300
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,820
Right, I mean, yeah, it's interesting.

1301
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,980
Like we kind of assume that the IBM culture

1302
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,620
will crush Red Hat or that's a lot of the fears.

1303
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,580
But hey, maybe it'll go the reverse

1304
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:33,220
and IBM opens up and some of this new blood distributes.

1305
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,340
But you're right, it's a numbers game.

1306
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,100
Brandon, did you wanna jump in there with some thoughts?

1307
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,460
Yeah, just IBM's contributed open source

1308
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,700
for a very long time.

1309
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,260
They have an open source culture.

1310
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,300
Yeah, I'm not, you know, I'm former Red Hatter.

1311
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,580
So I have a different perspective,

1312
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,460
but I don't think it's gonna be all the doom and gloom.

1313
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,060
But that's just my personal opinion.

1314
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,900
Good.

1315
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,100
Do you feel it is because IBM has been a good steward

1316
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:00,100
to open source in the past

1317
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,300
or what is it that's making you feel?

1318
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,380
It's been a good steward.

1319
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,340
A few people in the chat have mentioned

1320
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,020
some of the things that they've done.

1321
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:13,900
They have a lot of projects between Red Hat and IBM.

1322
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,620
I think they've contributed more to open source

1323
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,460
than any one period.

1324
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:24,820
So it'll be interesting.

1325
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,580
If not, you know, if all's fails,

1326
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,300
everything Red Hat does is open source,

1327
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,420
just go fork it, right?

1328
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,420
Right, and I think that is a nice safety hatch we have here

1329
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:42,460
is there's free software and the original contributors

1330
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,940
still own the copyrights of them.

1331
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,020
So that's impressive and that is good to note.

1332
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,220
I hope so.

1333
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:52,020
I think in some ways it could supercharge

1334
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,100
their sales engine and that could be really good.

1335
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,980
And in the meantime, business continues as normal.

1336
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,980
Today, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 shipped

1337
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:05,260
and Fedora 29 shipped.

1338
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,500
Now this I am very excited about.

1339
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,220
There's a big feature in Fedora 29

1340
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,900
that I've been looking forward to trying.

1341
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,700
And in just one week as we record this episode,

1342
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,260
it will be 15 years since they announced

1343
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,660
the release of Fedora Core 1.

1344
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,100
Wow. Yeah, it's big.

1345
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,900
That's big, that's a big deal.

1346
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:24,220
And now they have not just like the core Fedora,

1347
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,260
but they have workstation, they have server,

1348
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,420
they have atomic host, they have all these different

1349
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,740
like little spins and stuff that are semi-popular.

1350
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:33,020
Of course, they have the cloud version that I use,

1351
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,820
they have support for ARM devices.

1352
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,060
And if this wasn't maybe thinking ahead a little bit,

1353
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,180
they even have a system 390 spin.

1354
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,660
So they're good to go.

1355
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,020
This release though, I think is probably

1356
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,460
from an end user perspective, the most appealing

1357
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,420
because it ships Gnome 3.3.0,

1358
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,940
which has some performance improvements.

1359
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:57,340
They've got better support for ARM images,

1360
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,060
including ZRAM on those,

1361
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:02,340
vagrant images for Fedora Scientific.

1362
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,860
But there's something else in this one

1363
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,580
that we wanted to talk about.

1364
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,420
The West got a chance to kick the tires on.

1365
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,500
And so we kind of took two tracks.

1366
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:15,540
I have been managing a Fedora cloud instance for years now.

1367
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,220
And I've been dutifully updating, updating, updating,

1368
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:20,540
updating, and then in the last release

1369
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,260
after having zero issues of updating

1370
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,620
after release, after release, after release,

1371
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,980
I decided I wanted to rebuild

1372
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,460
and build a bigger, stronger Fedora box

1373
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,740
and use cockpit to manage it and move everything I had.

1374
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,740
I had multiple systems and I moved everything to one system

1375
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,500
and then put it in containers on that one system.

1376
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,300
But I wanted to experiment with that

1377
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,140
and I wanted to use Fedora cloud to do it.

1378
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:43,260
And I ended up using my next cloud instance in production.

1379
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,620
I attached an extra 250 gigs of digital ocean storage

1380
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,660
to that droplet, put my next cloud folder on there,

1381
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,740
and that's mounted inside the container.

1382
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,980
It's all very nice, right?

1383
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,500
So I sit down, I'm like, okay, Self,

1384
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,700
you're gonna take this Fedora 28 system up to Fedora 29.

1385
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,540
We're gonna start this upgrade all over again.

1386
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,260
You got your tool belts on, you're at the console.

1387
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,740
I was, it was good.

1388
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,460
It was, so the first thing I did is I logged into cockpit

1389
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,260
and just did all the security and system updates.

1390
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,180
I couldn't do a distribution upgrade in there though.

1391
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,540
So I had to, so I SSH into the box.

1392
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,140
Oh, old school. Yeah.

1393
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,300
And you know, the DNF commands are well-documented.

1394
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,540
Like you, first you do like this update thing

1395
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,380
and then you install like an upgrade plugin

1396
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,340
and then you just, there's like three commands.

1397
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:30,180
And then the final command is do a DNF reboot.

1398
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:32,260
And this is neat because it ties in with system D,

1399
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,420
reboots your system.

1400
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,540
And while it's in the boot up state, clean,

1401
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,060
installs the packages, checks it,

1402
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,340
and then reboots the system once more

1403
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,700
and you boot up with all the fresh stuff.

1404
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,020
Oh, that is nice.

1405
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,260
So I do that once with cockpit.

1406
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,140
So that way I have a 28 update that's totally current,

1407
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,860
all up to date, everything's working.

1408
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,420
It just feels like the best way to do it.

1409
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,020
Then I SSH in and I do all that DNF stuff,

1410
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,500
get the 29 upgrade going, does the same process,

1411
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,540
it reboots, you know, does the install upgrades at all.

1412
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,780
So now I have a full 29 install that's up to date.

1413
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:59,620
Just like that.

1414
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,300
Boots up, feels like it takes forever

1415
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,460
because when it's doing that system D upgrade

1416
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:06,700
in the background, it's offline.

1417
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,740
And so you're just sitting there waiting

1418
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,420
for your box to come back.

1419
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,580
And hoping, hoping that it pings again

1420
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,460
or your SSH connection resumes.

1421
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,700
I have been remotely upgrading servers

1422
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,580
in one form or another, literally since the 90s.

1423
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:26,060
And it's still just as anxiety inducing

1424
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:28,660
during that moment as it ever has been.

1425
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,980
It doesn't matter if I have an IP KVM

1426
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,380
or an HTML5 console that I can use in any browser I want

1427
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,380
via the Ting dashboard for days, it doesn't matter.

1428
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,500
I still am anxious during that time

1429
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,220
when I can't ping the box.

1430
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,300
I mean, it's just natural, right?

1431
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,300
Nothing else is happening.

1432
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,020
I'm just sitting there staring at the terminal.

1433
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:45,860
That's all that's happening.

1434
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,420
Well, and even with the best of intentions,

1435
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:51,580
all the snapshots, mutable file systems,

1436
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:52,420
things can still break.

1437
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,620
It's still just, I don't know, man.

1438
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,460
I just don't know.

1439
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,300
And of course, you know what?

1440
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,060
Now I think about it, I didn't do a snapshot beforehand.

1441
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,420
I think I have backups for that box,

1442
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,260
but I didn't actually.

1443
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,660
Oh, you reckless admin.

1444
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,940
I just went for it, I just went for it.

1445
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,940
You can tell I'm from a day before, I'm pre-VPS, Wes.

1446
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,140
Anyways, so it boots up finally.

1447
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:15,540
And I type in the Nextcloud URL, hit Enter on the old box.

1448
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,940
Page cannot be found.

1449
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,100
Oh no, this is it.

1450
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,060
After like years of doing these upgrades,

1451
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,700
like this is the one that broke, this is it.

1452
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,180
And I'm like, all right, what about my cockpit URL?

1453
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,100
Because cockpit, by the way, it's just great.

1454
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,180
So I log in, cockpit's working.

1455
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,500
I can SSH into the box.

1456
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,540
Okay, so what's up?

1457
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,780
I can ping it, cockpit's fine.

1458
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,980
I'm digging around, I go to the container section,

1459
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,460
and I see that my containers are restarting.

1460
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,780
All of them are just stuck in this restarting loop.

1461
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,500
And it's hit my CPU because I've got a database container,

1462
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,540
I've got a Nextcloud container, excuse me,

1463
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:50,620
I've got an MB container,

1464
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,180
and they're all just rebooting constantly,

1465
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,020
rebooting, rebooting.

1466
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,140
As fast as the system can reboot a container,

1467
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,060
these things are cycling.

1468
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,580
And I'm like, okay, what?

1469
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,540
I know I've seen this before.

1470
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,660
How did I fix this before?

1471
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,180
And I'm still looking at it, and I look at the,

1472
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,660
because in cockpit, it puts the console log right there,

1473
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,020
so you can click on the container,

1474
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,580
you can actually see the console log in cockpit.

1475
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,020
And I see permission denied, permission denied.

1476
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:14,140
It's just permission denied scrolling past my screen

1477
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,860
as fast as it can possibly.

1478
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,540
I know I've seen this after an upgrade before.

1479
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,780
Think about it for a second, oh, of course.

1480
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,620
It was SELinux.

1481
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,460
Of course it's SELinux.

1482
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,300
Of course it's SELinux.

1483
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,460
Of course it's SELinux.

1484
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,220
So I had to get that, and that just got reset

1485
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,060
as part of the upgrade.

1486
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,020
Right, it's because you enabled a lot of custom stuff,

1487
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,780
right, you really tuned SELinux perfectly for your use case.

1488
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,820
Oh yeah, you know me, not that off button at all,

1489
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,900
not for me.

1490
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:37,740
I got a question though.

1491
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,580
So that's not the thing I was most excited about.

1492
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,380
That was just my standard test I do with Fedora 9.

1493
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,020
But the feature that I am the most excited about,

1494
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,700
we had talked to Matthew Miller about it ages ago.

1495
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,940
We've been teasing it for a long time.

1496
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:53,580
It's finally landing in Fedora 29, and it's modularity.

1497
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,980
This release is particularly exciting

1498
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,300
because it is the first to include Fedora modularity,

1499
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,820
which features a system that allows

1500
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,540
you to install a version.

1501
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,900
Boy, this is hard to explain.

1502
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,500
It allows you to install, say, a version of Node.js

1503
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,500
that is not in the main package repository of the version

1504
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,860
of Fedora you're using.

1505
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,900
So say Fedora 30 ships, and you want

1506
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,100
to use a newer version of Node.js.

1507
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,820
Or you need to use the version that was in Fedora 28.

1508
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:21,980
You can now mix and match the versions

1509
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,780
with these modular repositories.

1510
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:28,620
You no longer need to upgrade your entire OS just

1511
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,460
to get the new Node.js.

1512
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,380
And what I love about this is it's

1513
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:35,620
sort of solving the same problem that Snaps and Flatpak solve,

1514
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,820
but from a different perspective.

1515
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:40,780
Snaps and Flatpaks are very developer-driven.

1516
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,940
That way, the creator of the software

1517
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,580
can directly distribute to the end user.

1518
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:48,100
And I think that's perfect for a lot of types of applications,

1519
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,300
even server-side applications.

1520
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,140
But package management, that's a sysadmin system.

1521
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,940
That's software distribution designed

1522
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:00,140
by system administrators for system administrators.

1523
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:03,940
And they're still valid uses for the package management system

1524
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,940
to manage server software.

1525
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:10,100
And the only real downside has been these version issues

1526
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:14,180
you run into when you're on, say, like, REL or CentOS

1527
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,980
or something that doesn't update very often,

1528
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,220
but all of a sudden, you need a newer version of a package

1529
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,020
that isn't in the repo.

1530
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,340
It starts to fall apart.

1531
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,260
Right, that's the perfect thing.

1532
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,220
You're like, oh, I have safety.

1533
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,180
I know nothing's going to break.

1534
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,380
And then you're like, oh, wait, no, but I need one more version

1535
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,580
because there's a bug fix that only affects me.

1536
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,820
And right now, one of our solutions,

1537
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:33,220
Flatpaks and Snaps, if you're dealing with server software,

1538
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,700
it's really only Snaps.

1539
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,500
And that works great, like, for something like,

1540
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,060
especially for, like, Plex Media Server,

1541
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,580
it's the perfect solution.

1542
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,980
But for, like, low-level stuff, like your Apache server

1543
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:46,140
or maybe Postgres or Node.js,

1544
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:49,540
do you really need to have that as a snap

1545
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:52,860
when you could maybe just have modular repositories

1546
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,580
that allow you to pull in that newer version

1547
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:55,940
on the older version of Fedora?

1548
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,340
It seems like magic, but it works.

1549
00:57:58,340 --> 00:57:59,180
Oh, yeah, it does.

1550
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:01,260
I mean, we've been playing with it here

1551
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,780
the past couple of days.

1552
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,420
The way to think about it is before, you know,

1553
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,260
a Fedora release comes along and they sort of pick,

1554
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,220
like, oh, OK, here's the version of Node

1555
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:10,580
that we're going to ship with this.

1556
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,260
And there would be a different one for 28 versus 29.

1557
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,620
Now, they're just taking whatever version of lists

1558
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,260
of nodes that they're going to support

1559
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,380
and building them for all the Fedora versions.

1560
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,700
So it doesn't matter which one.

1561
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,380
You can pick and match your version of Node

1562
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,180
and your version of Fedora support totally independently.

1563
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,540
So this isn't some crazy container system

1564
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,380
they're doing.

1565
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,020
Right, and you're not running multiple of those.

1566
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:30,860
What you get to do is there's this...

1567
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:31,980
You get one Node.js.

1568
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,700
You pick your version, but you get one Node.js.

1569
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,740
Yes, and DNF now has this module system

1570
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,940
that you can tie in, and there's commands for it.

1571
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:40,060
And you can see, and you basically choose, like,

1572
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,140
all right, well, I know that my app

1573
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,940
is targeted at the older Node 8,

1574
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:45,220
so I'm going to make sure that that module is what I pick.

1575
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:47,740
And then when you go and use DNF to install Node,

1576
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:49,540
it knows which dependencies and which systems

1577
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,540
it actually needs to use.

1578
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,860
And then it just gets updated

1579
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,500
as part of your DNF upgrade process.

1580
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,820
It's just one of the many packages installed.

1581
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,460
That's the nice part is that you can get

1582
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,900
some newer software, but it's still tied in

1583
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,340
with the distribution.

1584
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:04,220
And this is as much of a DNF change

1585
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,220
as it is the repo change.

1586
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,860
Like, they had to make changes

1587
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,300
in how they keep track of versions,

1588
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,700
how they build them for the different versions.

1589
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,740
Yeah, a lot of build system changes.

1590
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:14,580
It's like a multi-component change

1591
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,220
that they've made to enable this modularity.

1592
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,900
That's also an impressive, like, project-wide effort.

1593
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,700
And you've got to imagine, by, like, the time 30, Lance,

1594
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,140
this is going to really be dialed in.

1595
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,620
That's some of the things I like about this is,

1596
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,780
obviously, as you say, there are a ton

1597
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,460
of third-party options for getting software,

1598
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,740
even just building it yourself if you have to.

1599
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,500
But distributions do a lot of hard work.

1600
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,300
Fedora does a lot of hard work getting the stuff packaged,

1601
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,580
having updates for the software that needs to be there,

1602
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,540
security updates, whatever else that you have in mind.

1603
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,820
With a system like this, you still get all those things.

1604
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:43,260
You can just get newer versions,

1605
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,020
or, as you say, older versions.

1606
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:48,860
I'll say the story now, as they call it,

1607
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:50,660
of how you get software on Fedora

1608
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,260
is getting a little complex.

1609
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,220
So you've got DNF in the repositories,

1610
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:58,140
you've got Flatpaks, you've got Copper,

1611
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,620
and you've got modular Fedora repositories.

1612
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:02,380
And I think I'm actually missing...

1613
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:03,820
I mean, there's things like RPM Fusion,

1614
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,140
which it just plugs in, but it's a separate project.

1615
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:08,020
It's true, there is that, too, yeah.

1616
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,620
So there's a lot of ways to get software.

1617
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,900
When we were trying out Fedora, I said...

1618
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:14,740
I'll tell you what I feel like,

1619
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:16,940
because I feel like Fedora is really great

1620
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,220
if you're just doing, you know, get down, start working,

1621
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,500
you're doing a terminal, doing a web browser,

1622
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,900
it's so great for that.

1623
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,300
But, like, what if you need it as your daily driver, Wes?

1624
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,940
Can you get Slack and Telegram and these things on there?

1625
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:27,780
How did that go for you?

1626
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:29,940
How did it go trying to get these Electron apps

1627
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,780
or these proprietary applications?

1628
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:34,500
With FlatHub, honestly, it was pretty good.

1629
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,140
Now, it went, I'd say, 85% of the way

1630
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,660
to being pretty seamless,

1631
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,260
where I could just go to the website,

1632
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,820
follow the installation instructions,

1633
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,980
and then, like, click through on the FlatHub.org website

1634
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:45,980
and install stuff.

1635
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,260
That didn't quite work with Known Software,

1636
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,460
but all of the command line versions of those same stuff

1637
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,500
did work just fine.

1638
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:52,420
Known Software just kicks an air up.

1639
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,620
Yeah, so that was a little cryptic.

1640
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,900
I didn't find an easy solution

1641
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,020
within the, like, first two Google results.

1642
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,220
I didn't try any harder than that.

1643
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:59,300
I'm sure it's easy to fix,

1644
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,900
but I just wanted to play with it.

1645
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,940
But, I wasn't sure,

1646
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,140
so that's interesting that you ran into that,

1647
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,780
because I wasn't sure if I was doing,

1648
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:06,780
so this is, if this is an actual bug,

1649
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,180
I might try to reproduce the process

1650
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,060
and file a bug for this,

1651
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:10,220
because I thought maybe I was,

1652
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,820
when I ran into it, I thought I was just being dumb.

1653
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:12,940
Yeah, we'll have to play with that a little more,

1654
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,140
because it was almost really slick.

1655
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,260
Yeah, I should stress, too,

1656
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:17,700
that, like, just running it on the command line

1657
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,100
and installing, like, the name of the Flat Pack

1658
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:20,940
works totally fine.

1659
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:23,860
Slack, Dropbox, Telegram, they're all there.

1660
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:24,700
Once you add the Flat Hub repo,

1661
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:25,540
you have to do that first.

1662
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,380
That part was easy.

1663
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:27,220
That was easy.

1664
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,140
That was, like, you just go to Flat Hub,

1665
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,260
they have a thing you can click,

1666
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,620
and just, if you're on Fedora already,

1667
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,220
it's all integrated so that, you know,

1668
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:33,820
it calls up all the right applications,

1669
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:36,140
it launches Dome software, it installs correctly.

1670
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:39,740
Yeah, and then you're able to get Telegram and Slack

1671
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,860
and all of the, you know, proprietary goodies

1672
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,940
that you use to communicate during the day.

1673
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:46,260
And it works on the Fedora desktop.

1674
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:47,980
Any other kind of impressions you had when using it?

1675
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:48,820
Any other takeaways?

1676
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,180
Like, there's that installer.

1677
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:53,460
I mean, I'm just not a fan of Anaconda.

1678
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,940
I will say that their newer,

1679
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:56,340
what is that, Bevitt or something?

1680
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:59,660
Their new, the new version of their disk manager

1681
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:01,940
in the installer, that's actually gotten better.

1682
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:02,780
I like it a lot.

1683
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:04,180
I hate the original version.

1684
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,820
The new version is pretty easy.

1685
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:06,660
It's gonna work.

1686
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:09,140
And I will say that, like, once we got it all set up

1687
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,940
on our JB test machine, it boots really fast.

1688
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:14,940
Like, once it's all installed, it's really nice.

1689
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,300
Yeah, it's probably one of the fastest booting

1690
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,020
Linux distros out there right now.

1691
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,820
I mean, so we've recently tried Ubuntu 18.10.

1692
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,580
18.04, obviously, I'm very familiar with.

1693
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:27,220
Elementary OS, we've recently booted on there.

1694
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:32,220
I guess it's about as fast as Haiku was, right?

1695
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,180
Yeah, you're right.

1696
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,180
It's about as fast, which is really fast.

1697
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,340
Which was pretty darn fast.

1698
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:41,780
Yeah, and then, so the test machine is Intel-based.

1699
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:44,300
And so it took both Wes and I,

1700
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:47,260
it took us until there was a bit of a glitch.

1701
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,300
You saw it in Firefox.

1702
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,140
Oh, yeah.

1703
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,860
But it took us a little bit before we realized

1704
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,300
our test machine was on Wayland.

1705
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,220
Totally on Wayland, yeah.

1706
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:57,900
We got a far way into the workday before we realized that.

1707
01:02:57,900 --> 01:02:59,180
And it was a small glitch.

1708
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:00,420
It went away in seconds,

1709
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,300
and the rest of it was pretty darn smooth.

1710
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,380
Yeah, yeah.

1711
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,780
I will say, too, the setup, like when you've got

1712
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:08,300
everything installed and then you boot up into Fedora,

1713
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:09,820
then it has you, like, set up your first account.

1714
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,340
Yeah, that welcome wizard thing.

1715
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,180
Pretty smooth.

1716
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,460
Like, it just does that, and then it reloads

1717
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,300
the GNOME session and logs you into your new account

1718
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,140
that you've just made.

1719
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,100
I'm surprised more distros don't use that.

1720
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:18,940
Yeah.

1721
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:20,460
But a lot of them just get it done

1722
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,900
during the installation process,

1723
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,580
which Fedora, some of those questions that they ask

1724
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:26,460
post-installation, they've removed from the Anaconda.

1725
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:28,140
There's obviously upsides to both,

1726
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,620
but I was glad that it worked,

1727
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:32,300
and it didn't crash Wayland.

1728
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,380
Yeah, that's true.

1729
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,620
It didn't crash.

1730
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,140
Oh, that's a good point.

1731
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:36,980
Huh.

1732
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,020
In fact, I'd have to use it harder.

1733
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,220
I bet you I could get it to crash.

1734
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,060
You know, I'm pretty good at getting

1735
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,180
no shell to crash. You are.

1736
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,460
I get it to crash usually. You have a gift.

1737
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,980
I do have a gift for it.

1738
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,020
Yeah, so this modularity, I think, long-term

1739
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,620
is the bigger deal, because you look at Fedora,

1740
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:53,140
it's got essentially like a 13-month support cycle

1741
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:56,620
per release, and that sort of means

1742
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:57,660
you're gonna need to update.

1743
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,020
If you were gonna actually deploy this

1744
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,940
in a production server environment,

1745
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,340
about every 13 months,

1746
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,660
probably just about right there on the nose,

1747
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:07,580
you're gonna need to go log into your servers

1748
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,580
and upgrade them, and one of the reasons

1749
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:12,460
I've been doing this experiment with this droplet now

1750
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:14,180
for ages is because I wanted to know

1751
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,420
how far I could push it.

1752
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,380
Is that really possible?

1753
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:21,620
I have now experienced more than five or six,

1754
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:24,220
I lost track at so many flawless upgrades.

1755
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:25,100
It just keeps working.

1756
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,100
Without issue.

1757
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:27,540
Part of it, it helps that the applications

1758
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,500
are containerized, so they're isolated from the system,

1759
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,820
and I have to keep those containers updated too,

1760
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:36,820
but it has made the risk surface

1761
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,300
of the upgrade a lot smaller,

1762
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,420
and so I have a very small core Fedora install

1763
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,260
that can just be pretty standard.

1764
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,100
Yeah.

1765
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:48,940
And when you combine this software repository modularity,

1766
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,380
it means that when 30 comes around,

1767
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,540
and I'm rather compelled to upgrade,

1768
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,460
if something I need to do my job

1769
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:59,620
still depends on 29's version of something,

1770
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:02,260
modularity will allow me to upgrade to Fedora 30

1771
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,580
but still run that software dependent on Fedora 29.

1772
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:06,940
When you combine it with RHEL too,

1773
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:08,060
it seems like a really good story

1774
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:10,420
because let's say you're developing on Fedora,

1775
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:11,420
and a new one comes out,

1776
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:12,460
you're not ready to update Node

1777
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:13,500
because your whole production stack's

1778
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,460
based on this one version.

1779
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,740
Well, you can keep it, and then RHEL's released,

1780
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,140
and of course it's gonna have an older version,

1781
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,820
but if both of them have the modularity set up,

1782
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:21,660
well, it doesn't matter.

1783
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:22,700
You just pick and choose and match them.

1784
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:25,980
Right, this modularity is clearly gonna be

1785
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:28,820
way more important when it hits Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

1786
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:32,260
and that's in light of this acquisition.

1787
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,900
You have this, this is the first release

1788
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:37,380
since we know about IBM wanting to buy Red Hat,

1789
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,460
and here's the Fedora project,

1790
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,820
and the thing that we are probably collectively

1791
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:44,660
the most worried about is what the hell's gonna happen

1792
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,500
to Fedora long term?

1793
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,460
Because they're becoming a hybrid cloud company,

1794
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,700
and I don't really know what a hybrid cloud is.

1795
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,100
I know what the cloud is.

1796
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,060
I know what hybrids are.

1797
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:55,540
Those are cars.

1798
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:56,900
So I don't know what a hybrid cloud is,

1799
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,660
but whatever Red Hat's gonna do

1800
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,860
to be the dominant platform of a hybrid cloud

1801
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:04,140
probably doesn't include a lot of Fedora on the desktop.

1802
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,300
Yes, right, like obviously there's lots of stuff

1803
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,740
that isn't just desktop specific

1804
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:10,340
that gets put in and tested in Fedora,

1805
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,300
but we don't talk very much or hear very much

1806
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:13,820
about the Fedora server story.

1807
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:14,740
So maybe even internally,

1808
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,260
maybe there's ways that they test all of that,

1809
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:20,580
but 13 months, you're not gonna run

1810
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:23,260
your five-year production application on it.

1811
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:24,580
It's a weird future.

1812
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,620
And that's just really the beginning of it.

1813
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:30,860
I mean, Gnome Shell is primarily a Red Hat project,

1814
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,660
or in a big way, GDK, GDK.

1815
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:39,900
And so using Fedora now in light of that,

1816
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:43,540
you sit here and you realize this is an important project.

1817
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,340
This is a pretty important project.

1818
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:47,980
And I don't want anything happening to Fedora.

1819
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:48,900
I want it to stick around.

1820
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,740
I wanna see 30 ship, because when 30 lands,

1821
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,860
I think we're gonna see more Project Stratus,

1822
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:56,300
or Stratus Storage, I think it's called now, land in 30.

1823
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:58,700
I think we're gonna see a more complete version

1824
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:01,420
of Pipewire land in Fedora 30.

1825
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,540
Plus, you're gonna see another go

1826
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,300
at this modularity stuff in Fedora 30.

1827
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:08,100
And aren't they also saying that that's when

1828
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,020
Silverblue's gonna be...

1829
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:12,140
There's hopes there that Silverblue will be pretty prominent.

1830
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:15,420
Maybe even the preferred workstation choice by Fedora 30.

1831
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:16,260
I don't know if they'll get there,

1832
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:18,620
but lots of neat stuff there with OS tree

1833
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:19,980
and immutable system packages.

1834
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,460
Yeah.

1835
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:24,460
Yeah, so overall, if you're a Fedora user,

1836
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,460
this is just another easy slam dunk.

1837
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:30,420
There's really, and with Flat Hub and Flatpaks now,

1838
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,580
and containers for server-side applications,

1839
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:35,100
the risks for upgrading between Fedora releases

1840
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,980
are getting really low.

1841
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:39,300
You gotta figure, if you kept that installation around

1842
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,460
for a while, when Fedora 30 came out,

1843
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,700
those Flatpaks are still gonna work.

1844
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,540
Just fine.

1845
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,940
And they've done some things,

1846
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:46,700
like it's easy to get H.264.

1847
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,740
They've even got the write-in GNOME software.

1848
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:50,460
You can enable the repo for Google Chrome.

1849
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,300
So like...

1850
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,140
Really?

1851
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:52,980
Yeah, I was impressed with that.

1852
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:53,820
I didn't do that.

1853
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:54,980
I'm gonna use some Firefox.

1854
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,260
And that's totally fine too.

1855
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,300
Look, you got a browser, you've got a great desktop

1856
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,860
and a good shell and all of that.

1857
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:01,260
And then you've got all the Flatpaks

1858
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,180
for your proprietary Electron apps.

1859
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,020
Yeah.

1860
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:04,860
That's it, that's what I need.

1861
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:08,660
That's my production machine for just day-to-day use.

1862
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:11,220
Yeah, and DNF, every time I use that tool,

1863
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:12,260
I'm like, damn, this is great.

1864
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,980
It's come a long way from the days of YUM.

1865
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:17,380
It's a package manager if you were gonna make

1866
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:18,580
a package manager, a more modern...

1867
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:20,140
Like if today you were gonna start over

1868
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,740
and build a package manager,

1869
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:22,900
DNF is probably what you'd come up with.

1870
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:23,740
There's still some things,

1871
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,740
like there are times where it's weirdly slow

1872
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:27,900
or some of the things don't feel very optimized.

1873
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,060
But you're right, like the principles behind it,

1874
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:32,060
the concepts, the abstractions there,

1875
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:33,780
they're really solid.

1876
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:36,700
Yeah, so you can get it at getfedora.org

1877
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:40,580
and go grab an image.

1878
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:43,020
They don't have the upgrade post out yet,

1879
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,140
but they almost always have those out.

1880
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,860
Oh, nope, still the old ones.

1881
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:49,860
But actually the commands still work, I think.

1882
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:52,100
You just have to change the release from 28 to 29.

1883
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:55,300
Just don't blame Chris when your machine doesn't boot up.

1884
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,740
Yeah, so if this modularity thing sounds confusing

1885
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:02,340
and odd to you, trust me, it is.

1886
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:03,900
And we have a link in the show notes

1887
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,740
where you can read more about it

1888
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:09,900
at linuxunplug.com slash 273.

1889
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,100
And they have a diagram up there

1890
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,220
on how modularity kind of works.

1891
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,780
It really just comes down to just

1892
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:17,140
making all the different components work,

1893
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:19,180
making the repository descriptions work correctly,

1894
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:23,060
making DNF understand what you're asking for, all of that.

1895
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:24,460
And then the applications being linked

1896
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,660
to the right libraries.

1897
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,700
I think it's a pretty cool system.

1898
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,820
I know they've been working on it for a long time.

1899
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,340
I'm surprised it took so long.

1900
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,380
I mean, this feels like something

1901
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,580
we should have had ages ago.

1902
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:34,420
Yeah.

1903
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,780
Well, I had an opportunity last week, was it,

1904
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,380
that we did our PipeWire episode?

1905
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,220
Oh, yeah.

1906
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:43,460
When that episode came out, I was down in Santa Clara

1907
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,820
at the Intel campus at MeetBSD.

1908
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:47,340
Look at you.

1909
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:50,220
They have these, boy, these BSD guys,

1910
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:52,340
they have a lot of conferences.

1911
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:55,220
But MeetBSD is only like twice a year in California,

1912
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,940
like the one down here in the States.

1913
01:09:56,940 --> 01:09:57,780
Oldly.

1914
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,220
That's, or once every two years, I'm sorry.

1915
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:01,540
Oh, yeah, okay.

1916
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:02,500
No, yeah, the other way around.

1917
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,060
They have plenty of other ones

1918
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:05,660
going on all the fricking time.

1919
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:09,780
But this one, the one that's put on by IAC Systems,

1920
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:11,900
is once every two years.

1921
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,340
And so I went to the last one,

1922
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,260
and that was at the Berkeley campus.

1923
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,100
Oh, yeah, right.

1924
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:16,940
Yeah.

1925
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:18,540
And so I got a chance to go to this one,

1926
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:21,260
and I didn't know what to expect exactly

1927
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:25,300
because not only was this post-Linux Academy acquisition,

1928
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,180
so I wasn't sure if that would be awkward or not,

1929
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:30,860
but also, at the time, it was when Linus was getting

1930
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:32,660
a whole bunch of, you know,

1931
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:33,940
just all the attention for getting,

1932
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:34,780
and he was taking his break.

1933
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:36,340
Like, I just wasn't sure what to expect.

1934
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,180
And it must be interesting, too.

1935
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:39,020
I mean, you're coming into a community,

1936
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:41,100
obviously, you know and like the BSDs,

1937
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:42,780
but it's not something you use in your day-to-day life.

1938
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,460
Yeah, and I know some of the people there.

1939
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:48,100
And the other thing is, too, it's like,

1940
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,060
it's like going to learn something about something

1941
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,060
that you kind of are tangentially familiar with

1942
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:53,940
but not like crazy familiar with.

1943
01:10:53,940 --> 01:10:55,900
So it's not like the kind of event I would normally go to,

1944
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:58,420
but I always find it to be worth the time.

1945
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,780
So I knew when I had the opportunity to go to this next one,

1946
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,620
I knew I was going to go, there was just no question.

1947
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:03,580
But I thought what I would do,

1948
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,980
because I have such a bad memory,

1949
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:07,660
especially when it's a week later,

1950
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,980
I took an audio recorder with me

1951
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:12,580
to capture some of my thoughts there at the conference.

1952
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:14,100
And I wanted to kind of recreate

1953
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,180
some of the conference experience for you.

1954
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:19,820
So this was me arriving at the Intel campus,

1955
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:23,380
which, holy crap, the Intel campus is multiple blocks

1956
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:27,300
with multiple sky bridges and multiple parking lots.

1957
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,900
That's what matters, the sky bridge count.

1958
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,740
When it's more than one sky bridge, it does matter.

1959
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:33,780
Like, this is a big place.

1960
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,860
So like, the first 15 minutes of me getting to MeetBSD,

1961
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,740
we're figuring out how to get from the parking lot

1962
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,620
to where I was allowed to go.

1963
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:45,140
But it was fascinating to be at their home office.

1964
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:48,540
So this is day one of MeetBSD California 2018.

1965
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,140
I've said my highs to, hey, Alan, there's Alan.

1966
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,260
Hi, people.

1967
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:53,740
There's Alan, said my highs to Alan.

1968
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:55,620
And we're getting seated.

1969
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,940
They're showing a montage of BSD people.

1970
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,900
I don't recognize any of them.

1971
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,740
I just keep waiting to see Alan up there.

1972
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,120
And you know what else I found?

1973
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,740
It's mostly just them eating food, just mostly

1974
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:07,580
them eating food.

1975
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:08,620
But we're getting ready.

1976
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,740
I think it's going to be a good day because we're here

1977
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:16,100
at the Intel campus in one of their convention rooms,

1978
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:16,980
I guess.

1979
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,980
What do you call this room?

1980
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:19,860
Gorgeous.

1981
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:21,100
Yeah, it's a big room.

1982
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,860
And they got a big screen, they got lights,

1983
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,740
they got professional audio.

1984
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:28,180
And they're getting everybody settled for what is clearly

1985
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,180
going to be a great day.

1986
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:31,140
And I got an Intel badge for the day.

1987
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,700
They gave everybody an Intel badge

1988
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,820
so you can get to certain areas of the building

1989
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:37,540
and steal all their secrets.

1990
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:38,860
Hey, there's a picture of Alan.

1991
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:39,860
Lots of pictures of Alan.

1992
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,220
He's a bit of a celebrity around there.

1993
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,580
So the first talk was good.

1994
01:12:43,580 --> 01:12:44,820
It was a really good talk.

1995
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,340
It was more of a fundamentals talk

1996
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:47,580
to get us going in the morning.

1997
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,820
Producer Q5SIS did a great Q&A in the morning,

1998
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,820
got everybody talking.

1999
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:51,340
Nice.

2000
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:53,740
It's a crowd of like 80, 90 that first day.

2001
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:57,420
So it was big enough that you felt like you're an event,

2002
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:59,500
but small enough that we could pass the microphone

2003
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,180
around the whole room.

2004
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,300
And everybody did introductions.

2005
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:01,980
Oh, really?

2006
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:04,060
Everybody talked about what project they work on.

2007
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:05,220
That is kind of intimate.

2008
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,140
That's neat.

2009
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:08,460
Yeah, and lots of joking about Linux.

2010
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:09,800
Because a lot of people were there

2011
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,300
because they're passionate about BSD,

2012
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,740
but they make their day money programming or developing

2013
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:14,860
on Linux.

2014
01:13:14,860 --> 01:13:17,140
A lot of device driver guys there.

2015
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:21,100
Network performance was a big focus for a lot of them.

2016
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,260
I have a blog post where I go into some

2017
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:25,260
of the details of the companies that were there.

2018
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:28,700
LinuxUnplugged.com, if you click on the blog link at the top.

2019
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,220
Somebody from eBay was there.

2020
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:38,020
Juniper Networks, Cisco, Groupon, obviously Intel.

2021
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:39,720
Just lots of companies that are interested

2022
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,140
in that low level stuff.

2023
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:42,680
And so it was fascinating to hear what they're working on

2024
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,020
as they passed the mic around.

2025
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:49,060
But the second talk I think was really symbolic

2026
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:52,420
because it was from an individual in Intel's open

2027
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:57,180
source group who has been a graphics driver, a low level

2028
01:13:57,180 --> 01:14:00,500
graphics driver developer for Linux for years.

2029
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:05,860
We owe this guy a lot of thanks for enabling tons and tons

2030
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:08,420
of low level graphics capabilities in Linux,

2031
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:10,580
not just on Intel Harbor, but on Intel in general.

2032
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:13,340
He now works on enabling general BSD technologies.

2033
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:15,100
I don't know what that means.

2034
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:20,500
But there was a clear tone to his talk.

2035
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,220
He had gotten that presentation at this event for 80 or 90

2036
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:29,500
people, super scrutinized by the Intel legal and brass in a way

2037
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,940
that his talks never get scrutinized.

2038
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,820
Because there was an area in there

2039
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:35,740
that they felt very delicate about.

2040
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:37,420
This is my opinion.

2041
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:40,940
And that's the area where he apologizes

2042
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:44,060
for how bad Intel screwed the BSD community with Meltdown

2043
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,700
and Spectre.

2044
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,660
That's got to be, right?

2045
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,140
That has to be on every one's book.

2046
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:50,700
And in there he, and I have a picture in the blog,

2047
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:53,060
and I have the quote.

2048
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:56,700
In there, they adopt a security first pledge that he makes.

2049
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,300
And you can see that in the blog post.

2050
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:01,220
But here's my thoughts after that talk.

2051
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:05,860
It's lunchtime, my favorite time of day one at Meet BSD 2018.

2052
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,900
I just wanted to share some initial impressions

2053
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,240
of the Intel campus because that's

2054
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:12,540
one of the coolest things about going to this event

2055
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:15,740
is getting access to the Intel campus with our security

2056
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:17,820
badges and our whatnots.

2057
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:20,180
But it is only a small area.

2058
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:24,160
We're confined to a specific area of the Intel campus.

2059
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,620
But even there, you can still glean

2060
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:29,180
a few things about their corporate culture.

2061
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:31,500
Of course, you get to see how they do security.

2062
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,100
And you get to meet some engineers.

2063
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,460
In fact, I've already met a couple of Intel engineers

2064
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,620
who are big Linux fans.

2065
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,380
And a couple of them are BSD fans too.

2066
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:41,900
But don't tell the Meet BSD coordinators that.

2067
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,380
They wouldn't want to know.

2068
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:47,660
And it's unlike going to an event center that is

2069
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:49,300
designed to hold these events.

2070
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:52,220
You are seeing a corporate building

2071
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,940
be adapted for an event.

2072
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:55,820
So we're using their corporate auditorium

2073
01:15:55,820 --> 01:16:01,940
that they must give big product presentations and Apple style

2074
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:05,980
events to their own employees in this room that we're sitting

2075
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:08,500
in there talking about BSD now.

2076
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,260
And they've had to give us access to their network

2077
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,860
so we can get on the Wi-Fi.

2078
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,540
There's facilities that has to come in there to provide food,

2079
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:16,780
like catering.

2080
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:20,240
And Intel has to facilitate all of that.

2081
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,740
And I've gotten the impression that it

2082
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:24,400
started a little broader.

2083
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,480
They were a little more concerned.

2084
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,100
They wanted everyone to have an escort when they left the room.

2085
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,740
They didn't want to provide internet access.

2086
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:35,560
They wanted to have reviews of what was going to be discussed.

2087
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:38,440
And over time, as they worked with the Meet BSD coordinators,

2088
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,760
Intel loosened up.

2089
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,180
They kind of became a little more hip to what was going on,

2090
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:44,900
the idea of it and the unconference fact of it.

2091
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:49,240
And now we just have full run of this area of the Intel campus.

2092
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:52,340
So day one has been really about everybody

2093
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:54,140
kind of getting to know each other.

2094
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:56,620
One of the first talks out of the gate was Chris Moore.

2095
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:00,580
And he talked about people building future BSD projects

2096
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:03,900
off of a true OS build system that they're creating.

2097
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,140
Don't call it a distributions, but that did sneak in there

2098
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:09,280
once, the word BSD distribution snuck in there once.

2099
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,140
The second talk was from an Intel employee, who in part

2100
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:15,940
wanted to apologize for the fiasco of Meltdown Inspector

2101
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:17,380
to the BSD community, but also was

2102
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,380
talking about some of the current things they're

2103
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,020
struggling with and trying to fix,

2104
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:22,660
things they were able to solve in Linux

2105
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,580
that they're now trying to solve in BSD.

2106
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:28,100
And that was a lot more interesting than I expected,

2107
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,540
to hear an Intel insider talk about the things they're

2108
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:33,780
working on day to day for open source that

2109
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:36,100
just generally doesn't get the day of light.

2110
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:39,100
Now it's net BSD after lunch, and then

2111
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:43,080
the one I'm looking forward to, a ZFS discussion panel.

2112
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:47,260
Yeah, I mean, when you've got the room full of folks

2113
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:49,140
that you do, you've got to talk about ZFS.

2114
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:50,580
And they did.

2115
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:52,380
And it's so funny.

2116
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:55,260
Like the ZFS panel now, they've done this before.

2117
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:56,940
And they don't bother going up there

2118
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:59,660
and having a talk anymore, because they really just

2119
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:01,860
have it down to a Q&A. Because everybody just

2120
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:03,020
has all of these questions.

2121
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,220
How do I solve this problem?

2122
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:05,540
It's a room full of people trying

2123
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:06,900
to solve storage problems.

2124
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,260
And the thing about the BSD community

2125
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:11,940
is they don't have this debate about what file system to use.

2126
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:13,620
There's only one file system.

2127
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:14,740
Well, I mean, there's two.

2128
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:15,460
There's UFS and.

2129
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:17,460
Yes, yes.

2130
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,460
Yeah, in fact.

2131
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,420
But you know which one they're for, right?

2132
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,220
You know what you're doing, where you're using it.

2133
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:24,900
The original developer of UFS gives a talk

2134
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,020
that I cover here in a second.

2135
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,820
So the ZFS panel, they go up there.

2136
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,900
Alan Jude, of course, up there.

2137
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,100
Dan Landgill up there as well.

2138
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:34,620
It was great.

2139
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,900
It was really good.

2140
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:38,660
I got to hang out with Benedict, Alan, and Dan.

2141
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,180
That sounds like a fun trip.

2142
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:41,380
It was a lot of fun.

2143
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:44,140
So here was my reactions after getting to hear

2144
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,860
a little Alan Jude ZFS talk.

2145
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:47,820
It's the end of day here at MeetBSD,

2146
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:49,100
for at least the first day.

2147
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:52,860
And the conference had a pretty strict schedule,

2148
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:55,300
but a very relaxed feel.

2149
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,740
I mean, every 45 minutes or so, something's

2150
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:59,780
happening, for the most part.

2151
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:01,320
There was a few areas here and there

2152
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:04,620
where the conversation got pretty in-depth,

2153
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:07,940
and things maybe ran a little long.

2154
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,340
It's a very enthusiastic crowd.

2155
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:10,920
Everybody here is very passionate

2156
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,280
about this particular technology area.

2157
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,940
And they just wrapped up the ZFS panel,

2158
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:16,580
which got a bunch of questions from the audience.

2159
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:18,540
The entire time, the panel did nothing but take questions

2160
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:19,500
from the audience.

2161
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,180
And now that we're all done with day one,

2162
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:23,020
it's time to go have a pizza social.

2163
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:25,260
The BSD people are serious about their food,

2164
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,260
just about as serious as I am.

2165
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:29,740
Where they had this pizza social,

2166
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,540
they had IT vending machines.

2167
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,040
Did I show you a picture of these?

2168
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:33,540
Oh, yeah.

2169
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:34,420
That is neat.

2170
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:37,180
Touchscreens that run the whole length of the vending machine.

2171
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:39,660
And it's got a companion storage box next to it.

2172
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,740
That's also the size of a vending machine.

2173
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:47,500
And inside it is Lenovo ThinkPad batteries, MacBook dongles,

2174
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:51,580
headsets with microphones, like your average everyday.

2175
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:52,820
HDMI adapter.

2176
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:55,780
A mouse, that kind of stuff, just IT accessories.

2177
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:58,860
And you, quote unquote, purchase it with your company badge.

2178
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:02,340
So you run your Intel badge, and then out comes a mouse.

2179
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:03,820
It's the craziest thing.

2180
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:05,940
So that pizza social was pretty fun, because I just

2181
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:07,740
got to chat with everybody.

2182
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:12,580
And I left early, because I've done enough of these events.

2183
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:16,260
And if it's not my core crew, sometimes I'll go out

2184
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:17,060
and I'll party late.

2185
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,980
But if it's not my core crew, I'm like, well,

2186
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,260
it was great seeing you guys.

2187
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:21,220
You guys have a great night.

2188
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:21,980
I'm going to bed.

2189
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:24,060
And I go to bed at 9 o'clock, and I get great sleep,

2190
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,380
and I don't get sick.

2191
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:28,820
You see, the other folks, though, they didn't really

2192
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:29,700
follow that.

2193
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:33,260
And I got there early, and I thought I was in bad shape,

2194
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:35,980
but the whole crew was hungover.

2195
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:36,940
Good morning.

2196
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:41,220
It's day two at Meet BSD in Santa Clara, California.

2197
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:44,220
Today is October 20, 2018.

2198
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:46,980
And the BSD folk are trickling in.

2199
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,460
You feed them, and they show up.

2200
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:52,620
Some of them were out quite late last night, 1 AM or so,

2201
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,660
being very geeky.

2202
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:58,420
I, on the other hand, being the seasoned fest-goer that I am,

2203
01:20:58,420 --> 01:20:59,900
was in bed by 10 o'clock.

2204
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,380
You see, I got these systems I keep in place.

2205
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:05,460
Keep hydrated, wash the hands, and go to bed by 10 o'clock.

2206
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,940
And then you don't get any con crud.

2207
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:12,540
But here, for these people, it's a rare opportunity

2208
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:16,420
to actually get together and talk in person.

2209
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,220
They do all of their communication

2210
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:20,580
primarily over IRC and email.

2211
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:23,180
So to actually get here in person and chat

2212
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,180
is a nice opportunity.

2213
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:27,500
So a lot of them show up an hour before the thing even starts.

2214
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:28,580
So think about that.

2215
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,980
They've been up till 1 AM.

2216
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:33,180
And then they show up at the Intel campus at 8 AM.

2217
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,820
First talk doesn't even start till 9 AM.

2218
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:37,980
But they get a chance to catch up with someone else,

2219
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,440
to chat with somebody else.

2220
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,140
And some of them are just pretty hardcore.

2221
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:43,660
Plus the free pastries, coffee, juice, and fruit

2222
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:44,780
doesn't hurt either.

2223
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,860
Today, they have a very special guest joining us.

2224
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,480
We'll get to hear from him.

2225
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,420
And it'll be a nice, steady pace.

2226
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:55,420
But I'm looking forward to getting a few more

2227
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:58,180
opportunities to have a few conversations with people.

2228
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:00,260
Now, this special guest was sort of teased.

2229
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:01,880
We weren't sure if he's going to make it.

2230
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,660
He might make it.

2231
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:06,100
And I asked Denise, who was organizing the event,

2232
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:09,220
how do you not know if your star speaker is

2233
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:10,260
going to make it or not?

2234
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:11,740
That's sort of rough.

2235
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:14,020
She's like, trust me, I know.

2236
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:15,340
It's very, very rough.

2237
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:16,020
We'll just vamp.

2238
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:16,960
It'll be fine.

2239
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,460
But they had been kind of teasing this might happen.

2240
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,460
But they didn't put it on the official schedule

2241
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:23,380
because they weren't sure.

2242
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:27,740
But in the BSD land, you have your royalty.

2243
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:30,300
There are people in BSD that are real royalty

2244
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,380
that the group has a reverence for.

2245
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:36,440
If they speak, everybody stops talking to listen.

2246
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,420
When they enter a room, all the heads turn.

2247
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,020
There's real respect.

2248
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:41,620
And they're not snooty.

2249
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:43,140
They're really down to earth.

2250
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:43,700
They're nice.

2251
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:46,300
In fact, if you weren't part of the BSD community at first

2252
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,420
and not maybe paying attention to the social cues,

2253
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,620
you wouldn't know they were anybody special.

2254
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:53,340
But because they're just another person hanging out.

2255
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,180
With hanging out with the BSD people.

2256
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,900
But when you know what to look for,

2257
01:22:56,900 --> 01:23:01,300
you can tell how respected these individuals are.

2258
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,660
And maybe one of the most respected

2259
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:07,420
is the creator of that file system, UFS.

2260
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:09,300
And he was able to make it.

2261
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:10,980
He walks up on stage.

2262
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:14,140
And the moment he's up there, he has all eyes.

2263
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:15,940
Nobody's looking at their laptops.

2264
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:17,500
Everybody's paying attention.

2265
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:20,300
Even though he's probably told the story they've all heard

2266
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:23,340
100 times before, everybody's paying attention.

2267
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:26,700
Because, I don't know, it's sort of like when

2268
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,940
you're that family member that you love the stories

2269
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:29,860
the family member tells.

2270
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:32,100
He goes up there, he tells one of his famous stories.

2271
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:37,700
Well, that was a great history talk by Dr. Kirk McCusick.

2272
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,940
The room really seemed to enjoy that.

2273
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:41,620
And that was pretty neat, because they

2274
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,780
weren't sure if Kirk was going to be able to make that talk

2275
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:44,900
because of jury duty.

2276
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:47,160
And at the last minute, he was able to make it.

2277
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:50,180
So they popped out some lightning talk rounds.

2278
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:53,660
They had a batch of lightning talk rounds and popped in Dr.

2279
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:54,820
McCusick in there.

2280
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:56,380
He went a little long, though.

2281
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:57,900
I don't think anybody's going to mind.

2282
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:58,100
Yeah.

2283
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,660
They follow the schedule pretty closely

2284
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:01,800
until Dr. McCusick's up on stage.

2285
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,540
And then he can take as long as he likes.

2286
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:06,660
There was sort of a different tone to the second day.

2287
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,820
And I go into this a little bit more in the blog post.

2288
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:11,740
But in the second day, it was a smaller crowd.

2289
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:13,140
I thought Saturday would be bigger.

2290
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:14,540
But the second day was a smaller crowd.

2291
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:14,980
Oh, that is weird, right?

2292
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:16,860
You think more people would be going on a weekend.

2293
01:24:16,860 --> 01:24:19,320
But everybody, so you'd had that first day where everybody

2294
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,220
had done introductions and sort of broken the ice.

2295
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:26,260
Then everybody hung out until like 1 AM, getting drunk

2296
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:27,580
and having a good time.

2297
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:33,500
And so the second day had a really casual, friendly vibe.

2298
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:39,300
Just like that, day two of being inside Intel

2299
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,580
comes to a close.

2300
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:42,720
They're doing the breakout sessions right now.

2301
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,700
And then they're going to wrap things up.

2302
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:47,860
The end of the day actually is the beginning

2303
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:51,660
of the party for FreeBSD's 25th birthday.

2304
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:53,140
So that's what we do next.

2305
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:55,300
Day two, though, is the one to go to.

2306
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:59,020
If you could only make it to one day, it's almost day two.

2307
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:02,860
Because by day two, everyone's guard's down a little bit.

2308
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:04,900
Everybody's cracking jokes.

2309
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:06,420
It's more friendly.

2310
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:07,660
It's more laid back.

2311
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:08,900
It's more natural.

2312
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:10,780
It's a great, fun scene.

2313
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:12,820
It's like hanging out with friends day two.

2314
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:14,340
Day one is great.

2315
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:16,620
But everybody's still kind of getting to know each other

2316
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:18,140
and letting their guard down.

2317
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:21,140
It takes that dinner, that hanging out,

2318
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:22,980
and that next day where things have thinned down,

2319
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:25,340
it's just a little bit smaller of a crowd.

2320
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:26,820
All those things add up to everybody

2321
01:25:26,820 --> 01:25:28,020
being a little more relaxed.

2322
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:30,420
And it makes it a really fun environment.

2323
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:32,540
It's been pretty cool to hang out inside Intel.

2324
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:33,900
They've limited where we could go.

2325
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,140
But where we've been able to go has been very nice.

2326
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:37,500
And they've been very gracious.

2327
01:25:37,500 --> 01:25:40,340
You combine that with the constant supply of fruits

2328
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,580
and snacks and coffee.

2329
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:45,380
It's just been a really good educational event.

2330
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:47,500
And now I'm going to go eat a whole bunch of pizza

2331
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,460
in the name of FreeBSD's birthday.

2332
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:50,500
They had a cake.

2333
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:53,180
They had, actually, it ended up being a taco bar.

2334
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:54,140
That was the other thing.

2335
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:57,660
I was there with listener Ryan, and friend Ryan, really.

2336
01:25:57,660 --> 01:26:02,140
And he and I are Linux admins, I used to be,

2337
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:03,300
and he is currently.

2338
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,140
And so we kind of shared a common bond

2339
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,140
over processing this BSD information,

2340
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:09,100
because we both have a Linux admin background.

2341
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:09,780
Totally.

2342
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,460
And he's working on tons of systems.

2343
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,000
He's got a whole bunch of BSD systems

2344
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,040
he's responsible for, too.

2345
01:26:14,040 --> 01:26:16,100
So he's coming at it from two different angles.

2346
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:18,340
I asked him afterwards, I said, what do you think?

2347
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,100
Was this valuable?

2348
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,580
He was like, every talk, I learned something.

2349
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:22,820
Every single talk.

2350
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:24,620
And because it's not huge, you didn't

2351
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:25,820
have to go to multiple rooms.

2352
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:27,940
You stayed in the auditorium the entire time.

2353
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:29,420
You weren't scrambling around trying

2354
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:31,140
to figure out which thing you were going to listen to.

2355
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:33,140
Yeah, you just basically had the hallway track,

2356
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,480
or you had the auditorium.

2357
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,440
And the hallway track was constantly

2358
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,980
Intel provided this area where you could hang out and chat.

2359
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,700
And there was always like, you know.

2360
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:42,060
It was easy to do.

2361
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:42,860
You weren't in the way.

2362
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:44,220
There was just a space for that.

2363
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:45,060
Yeah, exactly.

2364
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:48,300
Or you could go sit in the main auditorium and catch a talk.

2365
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:51,620
And so you always were able to catch all the talks.

2366
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:55,200
Or if there was one that just didn't really appeal to you,

2367
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,260
you could take a break.

2368
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:57,740
It was really nicely done.

2369
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:59,860
A lot of the Linux events that we go to now

2370
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:03,380
are so big that there's multiple tracks happening

2371
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:04,160
at the same time.

2372
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:05,540
And you get there.

2373
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:07,420
And this is, I think, a common problem

2374
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:09,180
that newcomers to conferences have,

2375
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:11,180
is you get completely overwhelmed because you

2376
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:12,420
can't attend at all.

2377
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:13,860
And there will often be multiple talks

2378
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:15,980
going on that you're interested at the same time.

2379
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:16,980
And it's really overwhelming.

2380
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:18,780
Whereas with MeetBSD, it's all in one room

2381
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,700
because of the size and the scale of the event.

2382
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:22,140
And it was a good size for me.

2383
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,020
I really enjoyed it.

2384
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:24,860
It seems like from what you've said,

2385
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:28,940
like there's a bit more of a cohesiveness.

2386
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:30,800
Or I don't know, at Linux events,

2387
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,140
there's obviously lots of people there with the same mindset.

2388
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:34,420
They're almost always wonderful.

2389
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:35,780
You like what-minded people.

2390
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:36,920
People are interested in the same stuff

2391
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,340
that you learn out about.

2392
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:39,720
But you're interested in maybe different things.

2393
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:41,060
Like maybe you care about Linux,

2394
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:42,740
or you just care about open source desktops

2395
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:44,180
and Linux as an implementation deal.

2396
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:47,140
Or you really love GIMP, and you don't care at all

2397
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:48,460
about containers, right?

2398
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:51,260
Was there anything different in this, in that if you go here,

2399
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,140
you probably use a BSD stack, right?

2400
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:55,620
You use OpenBSD on your firewall.

2401
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:57,860
You use FreeBSD for a whole bunch of your desktops

2402
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:59,900
that like, was it different?

2403
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:06,100
You know, there is a cohesiveness and a singularness

2404
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:09,620
of thought that we don't have in Linux, for sure.

2405
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:10,820
More so than we have in Linux.

2406
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:13,980
But at the same time, more than I've ever seen,

2407
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:15,820
I saw a lot of fragmentation.

2408
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:17,180
I was really surprised.

2409
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:18,740
So behind the scenes, and I think

2410
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,340
one of the things that I learned in this event

2411
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:22,660
that the BSDs are really going to struggle with

2412
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:24,180
is modernization.

2413
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:26,060
A lot of people like to use BSD because it's

2414
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:27,980
how things have been done for a long time, which

2415
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:30,500
means when you need to modernize, people don't like it.

2416
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:33,360
Before the General Meet BSD people attended,

2417
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,620
there was a developer summit.

2418
01:28:34,620 --> 01:28:36,580
And in there, they were trying, some of the developers

2419
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:38,120
were trying to make a case to the other developers

2420
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:41,340
that we need to move to Git off of SVN.

2421
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:42,780
And that wasn't going over.

2422
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:45,580
I mean, the sell is, well, OK, well, we'll build a bridge

2423
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:47,780
so you can keep doing SVN, and on the back end,

2424
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:50,580
we'll have that going up to Git.

2425
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,540
So there's a resistance to change, which

2426
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,260
could be challenging for them.

2427
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:57,540
But yeah, I mean, I think that's both like many things.

2428
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:58,900
That's a positive and negative, right?

2429
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,620
Yeah, it means that it's more carefully crafted.

2430
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:02,340
But it means you have certain developers who are like,

2431
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,460
come on, man, we need to start doing this in a better

2432
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:05,300
way, in a newer way.

2433
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:06,060
And then you have other people like,

2434
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,100
this has worked fine for 20, 30 years.

2435
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:09,900
We don't need to change this.

2436
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:12,620
And that's a hard argument that they get stuck at, I think.

2437
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:13,980
But they're managing it, and they're

2438
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:15,780
trying to walk that line while still

2439
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:18,100
being respectful to the old way of doing things.

2440
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,600
So they're trying to walk the line.

2441
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,780
The other thing is, I was really surprised.

2442
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:23,940
They asked how many people in the room are using Trident,

2443
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:26,060
the new desktop.

2444
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,460
Only the developers of Trident were using it.

2445
01:29:28,460 --> 01:29:29,980
Interesting.

2446
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:32,300
A lot of them were just using the command line.

2447
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:34,940
There's a lot of differences in how they use it.

2448
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:37,180
But I'd say they have more in common

2449
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:39,300
than the average group of Linux users does.

2450
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:40,620
That was my over.

2451
01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:42,900
I was surprised where they differed.

2452
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:45,140
And I realized, damn, that could be a drag on the project

2453
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:46,340
in some cases.

2454
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:48,860
But I felt like they differed in less places overall.

2455
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:50,540
Yeah, it's impressive.

2456
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:53,200
BSDs, obviously, they're separate communities,

2457
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:55,500
and they're separate BSD projects when we say the BSDs.

2458
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:58,420
But in general, it seems like they've

2459
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:00,060
grown a really good community that's

2460
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:01,220
supportive and interesting.

2461
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:04,060
And they all do a good job of just making cool shit.

2462
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:04,860
Professional.

2463
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:06,340
I felt like it was a professional event.

2464
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:07,100
It was well-run.

2465
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,020
IX Systems does a great job.

2466
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:11,020
And it was really gracious of Intel to host it there.

2467
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:12,740
So anyways, that's my take on Meet BSD.

2468
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:14,820
It was totally worth going, even as a Linux user.

2469
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:17,500
I would go again to the next one.

2470
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:18,020
I agree.

2471
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:20,140
I don't think every talk I learned something.

2472
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:23,360
But absolutely every day, I learned several things

2473
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,820
that I thought were valuable.

2474
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:27,820
Is there anything you think Linux conferences or conventions

2475
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:31,900
can learn from the way Meet BSD happened?

2476
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:33,240
It's really hard to say, because one

2477
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,860
of the things that made it so great was the size.

2478
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:37,260
Wasn't so big.

2479
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,460
And that's really hard to deal with,

2480
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:42,020
because we just have a lot of people to come to these events.

2481
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:44,140
But that's something worth that.

2482
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:45,980
I do think it's something worth thinking about.

2483
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:48,420
And I think it's something that organizers of Linux events

2484
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:49,680
should consider doing is attending

2485
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:50,720
some of these BSD events.

2486
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:53,700
Because it feels like you're not overworked,

2487
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:54,900
but you're getting stuff done.

2488
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:56,020
You're learning stuff.

2489
01:30:56,020 --> 01:30:58,600
It's worth your time, but you don't

2490
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,860
feel like you're at work.

2491
01:30:59,860 --> 01:31:02,580
And you can feel like maybe you don't have so much FOMO.

2492
01:31:02,580 --> 01:31:05,580
You feel like you understood the whole conference.

2493
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:07,780
I want to do a follow up to last week's episode,

2494
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:11,340
where we finally got that review of the Dell Precision 5530,

2495
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:13,340
that monster of a system.

2496
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:16,020
It looks like a bigger version of the XPS 13.

2497
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:18,340
But I wanted to follow up and say,

2498
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:21,140
we've posted a companion blog post of the review,

2499
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:24,100
so that way you can see what it actually looks like,

2500
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:26,320
because it is a beautiful machine.

2501
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,460
And I posted some additional thoughts about the review

2502
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:32,500
and links to the benchmarks that I mentioned in that review.

2503
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:34,100
So if you go to linuxunplugged.com,

2504
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:36,060
look for the blog link at the top of the site,

2505
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:38,660
and then you'll find the post for both Meet BSD

2506
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:40,300
and the Dell machine.

2507
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,420
It's a good looking machine.

2508
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:43,780
So it's like we had to show some pictures of it.

2509
01:31:43,780 --> 01:31:45,620
But be honest, the real reason was just

2510
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:48,540
to show up that cute picture of Dylan.

2511
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:50,040
I did debate putting that picture in,

2512
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:51,500
but I thought it was good scale.

2513
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:54,220
Here's what it looks like with the kid in there.

2514
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:56,820
It's a good looking laptop, and he's a good looking kid,

2515
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:58,340
so you put them both in there.

2516
01:31:58,340 --> 01:31:59,740
The thing I like about that too is

2517
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:02,820
it's the perfect example of you might not bring it with you

2518
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:04,740
to the beach every time, but if you need to,

2519
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:05,900
you definitely can.

2520
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,740
Yeah, I actually, this makes me sound like a hipster,

2521
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:12,660
but I actually walked like a mile to a coffee shop

2522
01:32:12,660 --> 01:32:13,580
carrying that laptop.

2523
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:14,420
And I thought, you know what,

2524
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:16,300
if I can carry this laptop a mile,

2525
01:32:17,660 --> 01:32:19,020
that means it's light enough.

2526
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:21,100
And so my review of the weight

2527
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:23,500
that I put in the blog there was,

2528
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,940
it's heavy enough that you notice it's in your bag,

2529
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:27,380
but light enough that you can carry it a mile

2530
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:28,220
to the coffee shop.

2531
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:30,780
So, you know, good enough, right?

2532
01:32:30,780 --> 01:32:31,700
It's good enough.

2533
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:34,460
Anyways, I don't know if we're gonna keep doing

2534
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:36,980
this blog stuff, so I did one for MeetBSD

2535
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:39,740
and did one for this Dell Precision 5530.

2536
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:40,720
I'd like to know your thoughts.

2537
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,640
Tweet me at ChrisLAS or go to the contact page.

2538
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,580
Is it useful when we,

2539
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,340
I think for like the hardware it would be,

2540
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:48,780
to see a picture of what we're talking about,

2541
01:32:48,780 --> 01:32:50,540
and then you can check it back later on.

2542
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:53,300
Like if you get closer to time to make like a purchase,

2543
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,720
you could always come back and check this.

2544
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:58,200
But at the same time, it means I'm out there taking pictures,

2545
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,700
we're writing up blogs, it's a fair investment in time.

2546
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:03,340
Not negligible, but if people are gonna look at it,

2547
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:04,780
if this would be a helpful addendum

2548
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:06,700
or extra reference for the show,

2549
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:07,540
it'd be interesting to do.

2550
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,980
We're exploring other ways of just sort of, you know,

2551
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:12,200
increasing our coverage and the ways we do that.

2552
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,340
And this is one way we could do it, you know,

2553
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:16,340
there's lots of ways we can make that happen.

2554
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:21,340
And boy, speaking of expanding coverage,

2555
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:23,540
Crazy Noah is blowing out the doors.

2556
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:24,940
Crazy Noah is, right.

2557
01:33:24,940 --> 01:33:26,620
It's just, when I saw this, I thought.

2558
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:27,820
We cannot keep up with that guy.

2559
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:29,020
My God, man, my God.

2560
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:34,020
So Ask Noah is near 100 freaking episodes now.

2561
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:38,220
And it's massive because not only is he doing

2562
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:41,280
like a daily show push to get to episode 100,

2563
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:45,180
so he's doing like episodes on like nearly every day

2564
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:48,180
this week, next week, but for episode 100,

2565
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:50,940
he's gonna have a party that looks awesome.

2566
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:54,980
It's at the Tamarack, I think it is, Tamarack Tap Room.

2567
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:57,980
And man, does that look good.

2568
01:33:57,980 --> 01:34:00,180
And I think Noah's gonna be buying too.

2569
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:03,060
So Ask Noah 100 is coming up.

2570
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:04,500
He's got a lot planned for it.

2571
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:05,860
So we wanted to give him a shout.

2572
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:08,140
So if I show up, I can ask him Linux questions

2573
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:09,460
and he'll give me beer?

2574
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:10,300
That's how that works?

2575
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:11,140
I wonder.

2576
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:13,420
I mean, so it's gonna be, I think it's November,

2577
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:15,700
I think the party's gonna be November 7th.

2578
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:18,900
And I'll have a link to the Tap Room in the show notes

2579
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:20,300
if you wanna check it out.

2580
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:23,780
It is in Minnesota, so just keep that in mind.

2581
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:27,660
I tell you what though, if I could make it,

2582
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,780
I would so, I called him up, I'm like,

2583
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:32,580
Noah, Noah, wins your party, can I make it?

2584
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:33,500
He's like, it's on the 7th.

2585
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:36,680
I'm like, damn it, Noah, I'm gonna be traveling on that day.

2586
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:39,060
So I can't make it, but it looks really great.

2587
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:41,100
And 100 episodes.

2588
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,900
That is not an easy thing to do.

2589
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:46,300
That is a lot of content and a lot of it, I mean.

2590
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:48,460
Yeah, he's gonna be doing, with these daily episodes,

2591
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:50,860
he's gonna be doing like format experiments

2592
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:52,260
to see what people like.

2593
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:54,180
Try switching up the format of the Ask Noah program

2594
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:55,340
and see what sticks.

2595
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:56,780
So he's gonna be looking for feedback and stuff.

2596
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:58,700
So if you've listened to the show before,

2597
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,420
maybe it didn't click for you,

2598
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:02,540
now's an opportunity to listen while he's doing this

2599
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,820
and let him know what did click.

2600
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:04,660
Yeah, exactly.

2601
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:05,480
And he'll do more of it.

2602
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,320
He's pretty keen on that.

2603
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,500
So that's the hardest thing, I think, right?

2604
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,420
Like from our side is, there's a lot of ways

2605
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:10,500
to present some of this stuff

2606
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,180
and not everyone likes all of it,

2607
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:13,900
so your feedback goes a long way.

2608
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:18,780
Now, just a couple of quick links before we get out of here.

2609
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:20,360
A couple of workarounds,

2610
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:22,780
if you're still using Dropbox out there

2611
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:24,860
and you don't have Extended 4,

2612
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:26,820
there is now DBXFS.

2613
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:28,700
You can mount Dropbox folders locally

2614
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:31,400
as a virtual file system on XFS.

2615
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,300
There's one.

2616
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,340
It's using Fuse, as you probably guessed.

2617
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:35,460
And then I'll link to another.

2618
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:36,500
I knew, I love the internet.

2619
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,380
I knew this would happen.

2620
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:38,220
I knew this.

2621
01:35:38,220 --> 01:35:39,300
I said, well, the first thing I said,

2622
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:40,640
you know, you could just make a loop back.

2623
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:41,980
Just make a loop back.

2624
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:43,580
Put that right, put a loop back image.

2625
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:46,380
Make a loop back and put that right there on your XFS.

2626
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,660
And make that Extended 4 and you're good to go.

2627
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:49,500
That's why I said that, right?

2628
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:50,860
You said exactly that.

2629
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:52,580
Make a loop back, loop back.

2630
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,380
Well, it is easy to do,

2631
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:57,420
but I just didn't really get around to doing it yet.

2632
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:02,420
So Ang P wrote up a rough how-to on Reddit

2633
01:36:02,780 --> 01:36:04,460
to do this loop back thing and then mount it

2634
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,420
and make it your Dropbox folder, et cetera.

2635
01:36:06,420 --> 01:36:07,620
So I'll link to that in there too

2636
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:09,500
if that's something you want to do.

2637
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,940
But you know, I'm just saying,

2638
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:13,940
I'm just saying this could be,

2639
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:15,120
with the effort you put into that,

2640
01:36:15,120 --> 01:36:16,540
that could be like half the effort

2641
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,500
it would take to move to next cloud.

2642
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:18,340
I'm just saying.

2643
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:19,900
Yeah, and I think one of the problems

2644
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:22,260
is there's a lot of things going on in Dropbox.

2645
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:24,900
It can be hard to emulate like DBA XFS.

2646
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:26,900
There's just a lot of things you have to,

2647
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,280
there's a lot of things you give up

2648
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,700
because they have all that magic with the file systems.

2649
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:33,180
A lot of these need to require connectivity

2650
01:36:33,180 --> 01:36:35,940
or you're gonna have to do manual syncing.

2651
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:37,900
Let's just go the FOSS way.

2652
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:39,780
Yeah, you know, and the thing is,

2653
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:42,020
is Nextcloud has been really,

2654
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:44,500
so this blog post I did for MeetPSD,

2655
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,460
I use Nextcloud to,

2656
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:48,540
so I'm taking the pictures on the phone

2657
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:50,580
and then I'm writing the blog post on the laptop.

2658
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:51,820
Well, how do you think I'm getting the pictures

2659
01:36:51,820 --> 01:36:54,020
from the phone to retext,

2660
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:55,740
which is what I'm writing up the blog post in?

2661
01:36:55,740 --> 01:36:57,480
I think you're sending them to yourself

2662
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,300
one by one on Telegram.

2663
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:02,100
No, that'd be crazy.

2664
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:03,060
I'm using Nextcloud.

2665
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:05,340
So I take the pictures, they sync up to Nextcloud.

2666
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:06,860
I've got a specific MeetPSD folder

2667
01:37:06,860 --> 01:37:08,340
I created beforehand to have them sync to.

2668
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:09,500
Oh, nice.

2669
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,360
So what I'm doing is I take the pictures,

2670
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:12,860
I go to the ones I like in the photo album,

2671
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:14,640
I share those to the Nextcloud app,

2672
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:17,300
which is set already to go to the MeetPSD folder.

2673
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,560
I upload them, sit down at the old laptop.

2674
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,640
They're already there right there on the file system.

2675
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,700
Bada bing, bada boom.

2676
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:23,540
I'm working.

2677
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:25,460
You slot them in, upload them up, then done.

2678
01:37:25,460 --> 01:37:27,400
So it's a nice system.

2679
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,100
I missed Dropbox still in a few ways,

2680
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:30,560
but it is working for me.

2681
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,420
And my Fedora upgrade didn't break it.

2682
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:35,020
So all in all, I'm calling it a win.

2683
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:36,900
Calling it a win.

2684
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,240
All right, well, they haven't said much for a little bit.

2685
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:41,820
So I encourage you to go get more poppy and wimpy

2686
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:43,460
because you're probably missing them right now.

2687
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:44,540
I know I do.

2688
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:45,380
I know.

2689
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:47,060
And they had a really good episode on Thursday

2690
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:50,100
where they were first with the Linus news.

2691
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:52,980
And they had a fill-in for wimpy and Jesse.

2692
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:53,820
And he did great.

2693
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:54,860
It was great to hear Jesse again.

2694
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:55,700
And he was on there.

2695
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:57,300
And I miss wimpy though.

2696
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:58,120
I'm not gonna lie.

2697
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:58,960
I'm not gonna lie.

2698
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,620
But it was a good show nonetheless.

2699
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:02,660
Another excellent edition of the Ubuntu podcast.

2700
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:03,500
Ubuntu podcast.

2701
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:04,540
Go check that out.

2702
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:06,020
Go get more Westpane.

2703
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:11,020
Techsnap.systems and at Westpane on the Twitter's P-A-Y.

2704
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,040
Any.

2705
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:14,460
Not P-A-I.

2706
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:15,740
John, we're right.

2707
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:16,560
Right?

2708
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,400
Get it straight.

2709
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,240
No, it's classier with the line.

2710
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,080
I gotta say.

2711
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:20,140
I gotta say.

2712
01:38:20,140 --> 01:38:21,300
And I'm at Chris Elias.

2713
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,100
The network is at Jupyter Signal.

2714
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:25,260
And of course, everything we talked about today

2715
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:29,480
is linked at linuxunplug.com slash 273.

2716
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:32,140
So if you wanna find something we talked about,

2717
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:33,180
grab a tool.

2718
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:34,280
Oh, we got all the links this week.

2719
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:35,140
So I mean.

2720
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:35,980
Yeah.

2721
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:36,820
Unlike last week.

2722
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:37,640
We take all the time to add them.

2723
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:38,480
So you gotta go click on them.

2724
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:39,340
Somebody better click them.

2725
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:41,380
If you have got a great app pick too,

2726
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:42,980
we didn't have one this week.

2727
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:43,940
Let us know.

2728
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:44,780
Let us know.

2729
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:46,900
Yeah, just take all the cool software that you find

2730
01:38:46,900 --> 01:38:48,460
and hurl it at us.

2731
01:38:48,460 --> 01:38:49,300
I would.

2732
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:50,120
Rapid fire style.

2733
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:50,960
I would.

2734
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:51,800
And we'll sort through it.

2735
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:52,620
Geez, that would be great.

2736
01:38:52,620 --> 01:38:53,460
That would be great.

2737
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,940
Also, call back to last week's episode.

2738
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:58,100
Used our jack audio setup on the road

2739
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,140
to record Linux Action News.

2740
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:00,940
It worked out great.

2741
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:01,760
We were crushing it.

2742
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,700
So those scripts, checked out in production.

2743
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:04,780
Good work, Mr. Payne.

2744
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:06,100
All right, thanks so much for tuning in

2745
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,180
to this week's episode of The Unplugged Program.

2746
01:39:08,180 --> 01:39:10,740
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

2747
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:15,740
Bye.

2748
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:42,260
Get it out of here.

2749
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:52,340
I've been playing around with a new to-do manager,

2750
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:53,180
Todoist.

2751
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:54,020
We talked about that a little bit.

2752
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:54,900
Yes, we have.

2753
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:55,740
But people have been asking me,

2754
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:56,980
well, what if I don't want something

2755
01:39:56,980 --> 01:39:58,340
as sophisticated as Todoist?

2756
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:02,660
I just want it to essentially make to-dos in plain text.

2757
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:05,520
Well, I found this really cool one.

2758
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,660
There's this little known Twitter account

2759
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:08,500
that you can follow

2760
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:10,540
that will sometimes tweet new applications.

2761
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:11,380
Nobody knows about it.

2762
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:12,220
It's my little secret.

2763
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:14,860
It's the at snapcraft.io Twitter account.

2764
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:15,700
And it tweeted about-

2765
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:16,520
Hello.

2766
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:17,360
Hey-o.

2767
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:18,580
And it tweeted about Taskbook.

2768
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:21,340
Some mysterious individual has discovered this

2769
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:22,340
and let us all know.

2770
01:40:22,340 --> 01:40:24,540
So you can snap install Taskbook.

2771
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:26,500
And it is a text-based to-do manager.

2772
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:27,700
You get a chance to actually play with it

2773
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:29,100
before you tweet about it, Poppy?

2774
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:30,260
Because it looks really good.

2775
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:31,100
No, I didn't actually.

2776
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:33,980
I did the bare bones of installing it.

2777
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:34,820
Huh, that looks good.

2778
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:36,060
Yeah, it does.

2779
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:37,580
It does actually look quite good.

2780
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:41,540
It's sort of that perfect blend of syntax highlighting,

2781
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:43,500
text-looking, kind of console-based-looking

2782
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,500
kind of text editor.

2783
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,860
And with like a rich command line interface,

2784
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:48,460
which are two of my favorite things.

2785
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:49,300
I know.

2786
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:50,740
I did switch.

2787
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:53,900
I'm gonna look out for your post about Dropbox

2788
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,900
because I've switched away from Dropbox to Syncthing.

2789
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:58,500
So I'm using Syncthing again across all my machines

2790
01:40:58,500 --> 01:40:59,320
and I love it.

2791
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:02,860
So why Syncthing and not something like C file

2792
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:03,700
or Nextcloud?

2793
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:06,420
Because Syncthing is kind of complicated.

2794
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:07,740
Oh, really?

2795
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:12,020
Next, all I did with Syncthing was snap install Syncthing,

2796
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:15,260
run it, and then it discovered the other machines

2797
01:41:15,260 --> 01:41:16,100
on my LAN.

2798
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:16,940
It said, do you want to add this one?

2799
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:17,820
I went, yep.

2800
01:41:17,820 --> 01:41:18,640
What about this one?

2801
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:19,480
Yep.

2802
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,320
And I just added them all

2803
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,620
and they all synchronized with each other.

2804
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:23,500
And I just drop files in a folder and I'm done.

2805
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:26,220
So it's not that much harder than Dropbox, to be honest.

2806
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:27,060
I gotta try that again.

2807
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:28,500
I always had problems with the discovery

2808
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,220
not working here at the studio.

2809
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:31,740
So, yeah.

2810
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:32,780
And it's a snap now.

2811
01:41:32,780 --> 01:41:35,460
So that also is nice because the other issue I had

2812
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:38,860
was my Syncthing systems would lose version sync

2813
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:40,660
if you'll allow the terminology.

2814
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:42,260
Yeah, they get out of sync with each other, don't they?

2815
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:43,380
But that seems like with snaps

2816
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:45,380
that wouldn't really be as much of a problem.

2817
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:46,220
Hmm.

2818
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:47,040
Hmm.

2819
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,180
All right, I'll give it a go again.

2820
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:49,100
I will.

2821
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:50,220
That actually is very encouraging

2822
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:52,020
because Syncthing's pretty nice.

2823
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:53,380
Yeah, there was a long time where Syncthing

2824
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:55,620
was like half of my personal infrastructure

2825
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:56,580
of getting things right.

2826
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:57,740
I should do that again.

2827
01:41:57,740 --> 01:41:58,580
It feels so good.

2828
01:41:58,580 --> 01:41:59,400
It worked really well.

2829
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:00,240
I just stopped using it

2830
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:01,180
but it wasn't because it wasn't working.

2831
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:02,740
No, it's like a real network file system.

2832
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:04,420
It's like everything's available on all your machines.

2833
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:05,700
Put it somewhere and there it is over there.

2834
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:07,220
Sync to each other, peer-to-peer.

2835
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:09,020
If I remember right, you can also do like proxying.

2836
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:11,620
So if you had like a Syncthing in a DigitalOcean Droplet

2837
01:42:11,620 --> 01:42:13,380
it might get around some network issues.

2838
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:14,740
I did try that for a while

2839
01:42:14,740 --> 01:42:16,460
but then it just, that also stopped working.

2840
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:18,020
This is what made me lose face.

2841
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:21,540
And I just, I guess I wouldn't say lose faith

2842
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:24,020
but this is what made me reconsider using Syncthing

2843
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:27,420
was I had these issues where randomly

2844
01:42:27,420 --> 01:42:28,980
they wouldn't discover each other

2845
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:31,040
or maybe I could see a local system

2846
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,180
but I couldn't see the one on the Droplet.

2847
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:33,740
Or I actually, the problem I'd often have

2848
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:35,900
is I could see the Droplet funny enough

2849
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,460
but I couldn't see my local boxes

2850
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:41,340
and yeah, I don't know, but again, this was ages ago.

2851
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:42,900
The only problem I've had with it,

2852
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:44,900
with machines not discovering each other

2853
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:48,940
is because the machine that couldn't see the others

2854
01:42:48,940 --> 01:42:50,620
had an IPv6 address.

2855
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:53,340
Ah, I was gonna say it wasn't using the same DNS server.

2856
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:56,900
Well, it was using a different protocol to talk

2857
01:42:56,900 --> 01:42:59,560
and so it was looking for the others on IPv6

2858
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:01,940
and none of my machines have IPv6

2859
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:04,100
so I just disabled IPv6 everywhere

2860
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:33,100
and now everything's working sweet.
