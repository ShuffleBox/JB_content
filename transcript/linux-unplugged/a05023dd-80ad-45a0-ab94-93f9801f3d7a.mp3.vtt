WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
I'm really glad that we got you on user, I think you're going to balance out those guys

00:03.680 --> 00:05.660
from across the pond, you know what I'm saying?

00:05.660 --> 00:10.860
What I think is cool about it is I feel like it's a show that I could play for somebody

00:10.860 --> 00:13.720
that's non-technical and they wouldn't be totally lost or bored.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.220
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

00:15.220 --> 00:18.040
And there's still enough in there for people that really like the technical discussion

00:18.040 --> 00:19.760
where you get something deep in there.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.040
I think you guys struck a really good balance, I loved it.

00:23.040 --> 00:40.160
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 267 for September 18th, 2018.

00:40.160 --> 00:44.600
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's mostly patched together

00:44.600 --> 00:47.080
and it's ready to go with a huge show.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.080
My name is Chris.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.080
My name is Wes.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.080
Hello, Wes.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.440
It's nice to be in studio, you know what I mean?

00:52.440 --> 00:55.400
Oh yeah, you're here, you're operating and you're looking great and we've got a great

00:55.400 --> 00:56.400
show today.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.280
I've got a lot of show in me.

00:58.280 --> 00:59.280
I've been off the air a little bit.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.280
It's pulling out the seams.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.600
It is, good thing I've got bands around me to hold me together.

01:03.600 --> 01:08.880
Well coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged program, we'll get into IPFS, the

01:08.880 --> 01:14.360
Interplanetary File System that works by you requesting a hash to the network and the network

01:14.360 --> 01:15.800
finds the file.

01:15.800 --> 01:21.640
It's all been really conceptual until this week when Cloudflare has introduced their

01:21.640 --> 01:26.480
IPFS gateway and we'll tell you how you can get started with this in a bit about the Interplanetary

01:26.480 --> 01:28.340
File System.

01:28.340 --> 01:31.840
Then you heard it right, Mr. Torvalds is taking some time.

01:31.840 --> 01:37.360
He's got some patchwork to do, but this time it's on his self, on his own person.

01:37.360 --> 01:42.000
Person patches, people patches for Linus and we'll tell you what's going on with Linus.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.120
We'll read between the lines in a few places and ask if he's dealing with burnout and then

01:47.120 --> 01:52.640
we'll discuss the new contributor code that has been committed I guess to the Linux kernel

01:52.640 --> 01:54.120
would be the way to put it.

01:54.120 --> 02:02.400
Some of the controversy surrounding that and maybe the idea that we're recognizing a new

02:02.400 --> 02:05.000
pivot for the development of the Linux kernel.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.480
There's been a bunch of others like workflow and tools in the past and perhaps now we're

02:08.480 --> 02:09.720
seeing something new.

02:09.720 --> 02:13.320
We'll discuss that plus some people are saying there's going to be a fork.

02:13.320 --> 02:16.080
We'll talk about some other projects that have implemented code of conduct and how that's

02:16.080 --> 02:21.600
going for them and then we'll end the show on a really great note.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.720
Wes and I have received our new work rigs.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.200
They came in just the other day, ThinkPad T480s.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.360
I've had a chance to load mine up with GNU slash Linux.

02:30.360 --> 02:36.280
I'll tell you the specs, how I'm achieving battery life that will blow you just away

02:36.280 --> 02:39.200
and the maybe bad news too.

02:39.200 --> 02:45.160
The bug that is in this series of laptops that affects CPU performance and the work

02:45.160 --> 02:48.040
around for that and then we're going to talk about our setup.

02:48.040 --> 02:52.240
What we're kind of doing differently from our past setups, we'll talk a little bit about

02:52.240 --> 02:57.520
what's important in a work machine for us and maybe some of the plans that we have to

02:57.520 --> 03:00.440
tweak these machines to make them a little better in production than they are out of

03:00.440 --> 03:01.440
the box.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.720
Maybe some software too, some stuff we've been playing around with.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.380
So we've got a lot to get into.

03:06.380 --> 03:09.800
So before we go any further, we've got to bring in the virtual level.

03:09.800 --> 03:10.800
We've got to.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.280
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

03:12.280 --> 03:13.280
Hello.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.280
Good afternoon from North Carolina.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.080
Hey, welcome back, Alex.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.400
It's good to hear from you.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.720
And how has the move gone?

03:19.720 --> 03:21.680
Hey, I survived the hurricane.

03:21.680 --> 03:22.680
Wow.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.680
Welcome.

03:23.680 --> 03:24.680
Yeah, that is a hell of a welcome right there.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.680
Not normally what you have to deal with.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.680
Oh my gosh.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.480
Well, it's good to have you back amongst us.

03:29.480 --> 03:35.840
You probably heard Brent and Dan is in there as well as Eric, ironic or ironic or Mr. Badger

03:35.840 --> 03:36.840
as I call him.

03:36.840 --> 03:41.120
MiniMech and TechMav are all joining us in the virtual lug today.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.400
And I wanted to start with this IPFS story because it sounds, well, it sounds out of

03:45.400 --> 03:46.560
this world.

03:46.560 --> 03:53.400
So Cloudflare says they are very excited to announce the Cloudflare IPFS gateway, an easy

03:53.400 --> 03:59.260
way to access content from the interplanetary file system that doesn't require any special

03:59.260 --> 04:01.520
software on your computer.

04:01.520 --> 04:02.520
Pretty neat.

04:02.520 --> 04:07.880
Yeah, they say we hope that our gateway hosted at cloudflare-ipfs.com will serve as a platform

04:07.880 --> 04:12.160
for many new, highly reliable and security enhanced web applications.

04:12.160 --> 04:16.280
It sounds like this is just the first part of their distributed web gateway project.

04:16.280 --> 04:17.280
Yeah.

04:17.280 --> 04:21.840
And this is all taking part on what is Cloudflare's quote unquote, crypto week.

04:21.840 --> 04:24.320
They have crypto week.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.760
And so this is part of it now.

04:26.760 --> 04:32.200
You guys know this, but just to kind of sort of get into the background of IPFS, usually

04:32.200 --> 04:36.440
when you access a website from your browser, your browser tracks down the origin server

04:36.440 --> 04:41.080
or servers that are the ultimate centralized repository for a website.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.080
Yeah.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.000
You know, it doesn't have to be how it works really though, right?

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
There's a better way.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
There's a better way.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.640
So you know, you start sending your request.

04:49.640 --> 04:52.920
It sends a request from your computer to the origin server, wherever that might be in the

04:52.920 --> 04:53.920
world.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.340
And that server sends back the content to your computer.

04:56.340 --> 04:59.680
That system has served us well for, I don't know, decades now, I guess.

04:59.680 --> 05:02.320
But there's a pretty big downside.

05:02.320 --> 05:05.880
Centralization makes it impossible to keep content online any longer than the origin

05:05.880 --> 05:07.120
servers can host it.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.120
And that can be expensive.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.120
Yeah.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.120
And fair.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.080
If you look at some of our like back catalog now, a lot of those links go nowhere because

05:13.080 --> 05:15.960
those servers are offline or their pages have been brought down.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.680
So what can we do about that?

05:17.680 --> 05:19.640
Well, enter IPFS.

05:19.640 --> 05:20.640
Ooh.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.640
Hmm.

05:21.640 --> 05:27.120
The interplanetary file system is really a peer to peer file system composed of thousands

05:27.120 --> 05:32.380
of computers around the world, each of which stores files on behalf of the network.

05:32.380 --> 05:36.560
These files can be anything like, you know, your cat pictures, 3D models, pictures of

05:36.560 --> 05:42.320
Levi or even entire websites, five, what, million or billion files?

05:42.320 --> 05:46.440
I can't, the number is so huge my brain can't even comprehend it, has already been uploaded

05:46.440 --> 05:48.640
and published into IPFS.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.640
That is impressive.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.640
Yeah, that is.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.360
They have a really good description of how it all works, including some graphics in a

05:54.360 --> 05:59.040
blog post that we will have linked in the show notes, linuxunplug.com slash 267.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.960
But it's like a block storage system, right?

06:00.960 --> 06:03.520
Yeah, I think the big thing is it's content addressable.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.520
So with IPFS.

06:04.520 --> 06:05.520
Hmm, yeah, okay, that's, yeah, yeah.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.060
It's not blocks, right?

06:07.060 --> 06:10.240
If there's data blocks, but it's not like a block system like a drive.

06:10.240 --> 06:14.040
Right now, so every single, you do group them into blocks, but every single block of data

06:14.040 --> 06:19.080
stored in the system is addressable by its cryptographic hash of its content.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.920
So that's how you can say like, I'm looking for this, I've got this hash, go reach out

06:22.920 --> 06:26.700
and then the network in a peer to peer fashion can then, whoever has a block that matches

06:26.700 --> 06:28.880
that hash can serve you the contents.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.800
And that could be a number of systems.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.100
And the network is what figures out where that's stored.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.100
You can actually distribute them.

06:34.100 --> 06:37.440
So if you've got, you know, you've got one, it's like a little CDN near you, but everyone

06:37.440 --> 06:38.440
can play.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.440
You don't have to have special permission.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.280
I like that a lot.

06:41.280 --> 06:46.000
And you probably figure there's a number of ways to access IPFS content.

06:46.000 --> 06:52.200
You can install IPFS on your machine and essentially become a node of the IPFS network.

06:52.200 --> 06:55.160
And it probably is the best way to interact with the network if you were going to really

06:55.160 --> 06:56.160
get down into the weeds.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.680
If you're going to be developing applications that run on it or really using it a bunch.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.840
But if you're just kind of curious, if you're IPFS curious, there's an easy way.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.680
And of course you want to be able to bridge to the real world.

07:04.680 --> 07:08.740
Now, of course there are already some of these bridges, but there's not that many organizations

07:08.740 --> 07:11.880
out there running one who have the kind of reach and bandwidth that Cloudflare has.

07:11.880 --> 07:12.880
Right.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.200
That's the big change here with Cloudflare doing this.

07:14.200 --> 07:18.840
They have, they're setting up this HTTPS gateway to it and that is going to make it really

07:18.840 --> 07:21.820
easy for people playing around.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.720
So that's IPFS in a nutshell.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.120
Probably just whetted your appetite.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.600
We could probably go way more into it really.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.600
Yeah.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.920
There's a lot of those topics I would like to play with more and cover more.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.960
But up until now it just had felt like, you know, it's like any project that's sort of

07:33.960 --> 07:36.800
off its own corner, doesn't see wide adoption.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.880
Maybe that can change now?

07:37.880 --> 07:39.360
That's what I feel like changed actually.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.360
You're right.

07:40.360 --> 07:44.400
It feels like IPFS is no longer off in a corner where I have to go get this Go app off of

07:44.400 --> 07:47.820
GitHub and build it myself to connect to the network now.

07:47.820 --> 07:52.680
Now I can use my web browser and if you get the hash, they've just made it, you put the

07:52.680 --> 07:56.160
gateway URL in there and then slash the hash.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.360
And that's essentially it.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.160
I mean, it's really simple.

07:59.160 --> 08:02.300
So you could see how you could programmatically catch, you know, build fetchers and things

08:02.300 --> 08:06.440
like that too for people that could go fetch the documents off of IPFS without requiring

08:06.440 --> 08:08.520
any fancy client-side software, right?

08:08.520 --> 08:12.280
Or if you want to use IPFS for your own things, backing things up or just providing content

08:12.280 --> 08:13.280
to people.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.560
Now you have a plain text link for regular folk.

08:15.560 --> 08:20.200
So I also think the other next step is, you know, building your own gateway.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.760
So what, you know, spin up your own droplet or something and build your own gateway to

08:23.760 --> 08:24.760
IPFS.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.260
So that way you're not going through Cloudflare necessarily because they'll probably eventually

08:27.260 --> 08:29.840
want to monetize that data, I would assume.

08:29.840 --> 08:33.000
And we just can't, I mean, while it's nice of them to do this, we don't really know what

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
their intentions are or how long they're willing to do it.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.200
And we certainly, it's a nice thing to have, but we shouldn't rely on it.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.200
Yeah.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.200
Yeah.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.240
And I am, I'm intrigued by the whole concept.

08:42.240 --> 08:44.200
I want to play with it more down the road.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.780
So I'm glad that they're making it easier because it's a good way to dip your toe.

08:47.780 --> 08:53.440
Last week in the post show, Eric, Mr. Eric, the IT guy stopped by and gave us his recap

08:53.440 --> 08:55.700
of the Libre application summit.

08:55.700 --> 08:59.280
It feels like this summit's getting a lot of attention, and I think it's because they

08:59.280 --> 09:00.880
have the right people there.

09:00.880 --> 09:05.560
Well, Dan and Cassidy from Elementary OS made it as well, and they've created a post up

09:05.560 --> 09:07.000
on their Medium blog.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.800
And Dan's here to tell us a little bit about his trip.

09:09.800 --> 09:14.080
And Dan, I'm curious, what was your big takeaway from the Libre application summit?

09:14.080 --> 09:18.880
Well, it was just like a really intimate setting compared to some of the other conferences

09:18.880 --> 09:20.360
that I've attended.

09:20.360 --> 09:26.880
So it was really kind of an interesting, different, really experimental startup-y kind of feel

09:26.880 --> 09:28.440
as far as a conference goes.

09:28.440 --> 09:29.440
That's interesting.

09:29.440 --> 09:34.720
Like everything was really kind of loose and undefined, and it was kind of like create

09:34.720 --> 09:41.520
in the conference as you go, schedule talks were kind of shuffled around and new little

09:41.520 --> 09:43.560
lightning talks inserted in between.

09:43.560 --> 09:45.920
And it was like it was very fluid environment.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.640
It was really interesting.

09:47.640 --> 09:53.000
Now Eric, he seemed to observe last week that there was, I don't know how to put it that

09:53.000 --> 09:56.160
doesn't sound like corporate speak, but like multiple stakeholders there.

09:56.160 --> 10:02.640
There was folks from the Plasma Camp, the Gnome Camp, and different priorities in the

10:02.640 --> 10:04.640
open source community were there.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.880
Did you get that sense as well, or did it seem like there was a particular audience

10:07.880 --> 10:08.880
it was playing to?

10:08.880 --> 10:10.400
Yeah, it was definitely diverse.

10:10.400 --> 10:17.840
Actually, there was a moment where Cassidy and I had just given our group talk, and then

10:17.840 --> 10:24.960
immediately after Alish from KDE got up to give his talk, and kind of the premise of

10:24.960 --> 10:30.200
our talks were like the exact opposite strategy, and it was really interesting because we were

10:30.200 --> 10:34.960
able to kind of poke fun at each other and kind of say, you know, like we're doing things

10:34.960 --> 10:37.640
completely differently, but what can we learn from each other?

10:37.640 --> 10:38.640
That is good.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.640
That is good.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.840
One of the people who puts it in the chat room, he was there, he says, you know, had

10:41.840 --> 10:44.040
a real un-conference feel in a good way.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.040
I like that.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.040
I like it.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.040
And what do you think of the location?

10:47.040 --> 10:48.600
Denver, some people love it.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.400
Some people think they should move it for next year.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.760
How much do you think that matters in an event like this?

10:52.760 --> 10:57.000
I'm asking you as somebody who does this as a full-time job, would you travel just about

10:57.000 --> 11:00.720
anywhere in the States for an event like this, or do you think location really does make

11:00.720 --> 11:02.680
a difference in who's able to contribute?

11:02.680 --> 11:08.080
For me, definitely having it in the States as opposed to in Europe made it a lot easier

11:08.080 --> 11:11.440
for me to get out there because our travel budget isn't that big.

11:11.440 --> 11:16.240
So it's nice to have more conferences that are Stateside.

11:16.240 --> 11:21.240
I think that it is definitely a thing when we have so many people that are either volunteers

11:21.240 --> 11:27.320
or like individuals or, you know, not representing large organizations, that having more conferences

11:27.320 --> 11:32.560
that are easier to attend for those people should be a priority in the overall community.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.900
You definitely piqued my interest.

11:33.900 --> 11:37.400
You and Eric both have gotten me thinking this is something I'm going to have to attend.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.160
Hopefully the timing and everything works out pretty well.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.400
Maybe you and I could both go next year.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.240
Oh, that's a great idea.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.280
We can lobby them to change the name in person.

11:44.280 --> 11:45.280
There you go.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.280
Hey, now you're thinking.

11:46.280 --> 11:51.760
Mr. Full-Time Podcaster over there, if you didn't catch episode 266 of the show last

11:51.760 --> 11:55.780
week, we announced that Jupiter Broadcasting has joined Linux Academy.

11:55.780 --> 11:59.820
We laid out the grand vision, our plans for the next few months, how we want to utilize

11:59.820 --> 12:03.720
the Patreon funding, and all of that is right at the top of 266.

12:03.720 --> 12:07.920
So I encourage you to go give a listen to that if you can.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.000
User Air is back as well.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
We announced that last week.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.680
Dan's one of the hosts on there along with Popey and Joe, and I think I'll be on the

12:13.680 --> 12:14.680
next one.

12:14.680 --> 12:18.840
I'm not positive yet, but my plan is to go on there and talk about my recent, what do

12:18.840 --> 12:20.840
you even describe that?

12:20.840 --> 12:21.840
Life event.

12:21.840 --> 12:22.840
Life event.

12:22.840 --> 12:23.840
Yeah.

12:23.840 --> 12:24.840
All the surgery and all that.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.160
Can I just say, Chris, it's so, I hope I speak for a lot of the listeners, it's amazing

12:28.160 --> 12:31.840
to hear you back and healthy, and we're all just super pleased for you.

12:31.840 --> 12:32.840
Well, thank you, Alex.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.320
I appreciate that.

12:34.320 --> 12:38.700
It is fun for me to be back because I do miss doing the shows, but I very much appreciate

12:38.700 --> 12:41.040
Wes has been filling in for me on Linux Action News.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.040
He's been killing it.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.040
Killing it.

12:43.040 --> 12:44.040
You set the standard.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.040
I just got to live up to it.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.760
I mean, some people show up and they fill in, but then other people, they step up, and

12:47.760 --> 12:51.160
Wes is doing, you can tell, he does the research, he dives into the story a little.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.160
I listen.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.160
I hear that.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.160
Look at you.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.160
He's doing the research.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.520
So that's been, him and Joe have been great on Linux Action News recently.

12:56.520 --> 13:01.360
I think it's 69, 70, and 71 if you want to go catch those recent episodes.

13:01.360 --> 13:06.080
I think they've turned out great, and it's a little different since I'm not there, which

13:06.080 --> 13:11.640
is funny for me because Linux Action News is the child of the Linux Action show.

13:11.640 --> 13:16.760
So I have a really strong sense of, not ownership, it's like co-ownership, but it's a strong

13:16.760 --> 13:17.760
sense of co-ownership.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.200
You gave that to the world.

13:19.200 --> 13:23.160
Yeah, so it's weird not to be on there, but at the same time, it's like now I get to listen

13:23.160 --> 13:25.360
to it, which has been great.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.580
Also recent tech snaps, killing it.

13:27.580 --> 13:29.320
You've been filling in for me extra hard there.

13:29.320 --> 13:33.880
You've had Wimpy come in recently and fill in, and on the last week's episode, Alan Jude

13:33.880 --> 13:34.880
stopped by.

13:34.880 --> 13:35.880
Amazing.

13:35.880 --> 13:36.880
Both of them.

13:36.880 --> 13:40.120
As you'd expect, that's an extended edition of the Tech Snap program because, Alan.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.680
And then this week, I won't say who yet.

13:42.680 --> 13:46.980
I'll tease that next week, but someone you likely know, a member of the community who

13:46.980 --> 13:51.040
really knows his stuff, a great guy, is going to be joining Wes if all works out this week

13:51.040 --> 13:52.740
for the next Tech Snap that gets recorded.

13:52.740 --> 13:56.220
So there's been some really great stuff going on here at Jupiter Broadcasting, even with

13:56.220 --> 14:00.160
me away, the wheels of progress, I guess.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.160
Oh, yeah.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.120
Turning and turning, and there's just going to be more and more.

14:03.120 --> 14:08.920
One of the things that we have coming up soon is we're going to be looking at ways to simplify

14:08.920 --> 14:11.960
and automate the production part of the show.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.280
So you can't really automate Joe.

14:14.280 --> 14:18.920
Joe is our editor, and that is just a process that you need somebody talented to sit down

14:18.920 --> 14:19.920
and go through.

14:19.920 --> 14:20.920
So we can't...

14:20.920 --> 14:24.360
Thankfully, you just feed him flax and then podcasts come out, so it works really nicely.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.360
Yeah, right?

14:25.360 --> 14:26.600
That's how it works.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.700
But everything after Joe could be done by computers.

14:29.700 --> 14:33.560
And that really is going to be kind of our goal, is we'll sit here, we'll do the shows.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.680
You can't replace us, hopefully, yet.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.040
Then Joe, you can't replace him.

14:37.040 --> 14:39.720
But everything after Joe could be automated.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.360
And so we'll be building tools around that.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.820
We'll open source whatever we work on.

14:43.820 --> 14:47.960
We're going to try to do it all in our new public GitLab instance that Eric has set up

14:47.960 --> 14:48.960
for us.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.200
What is the URL for that, Eric?

14:50.200 --> 14:51.200
It's Jupiter...

14:51.200 --> 14:52.200
What is it?

14:52.200 --> 14:53.200
Jupitercode.io?

14:53.200 --> 15:00.180
Yeah, it's GitLab.Jupitercode.io, and it's just going to be the start of a collection

15:00.180 --> 15:01.680
of tools that we're going to use.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.880
Hopefully get something like a Jenkins or something along those lines up and running

15:04.880 --> 15:05.880
at some point.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.640
Yet another domain name, Chris.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.640
I know.

15:08.640 --> 15:09.640
I love my domain names.

15:09.640 --> 15:10.640
You got a collection now.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.000
I really do.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.080
Turns out, a little side, when you sell a business, those domain names are actually

15:16.080 --> 15:17.080
worth something.

15:17.080 --> 15:21.200
So it was an investment all along, and I just didn't even know it.

15:21.200 --> 15:26.960
So the other potential use for that GitLab instance that Eric has set up is the issue

15:26.960 --> 15:27.960
tracker.

15:27.960 --> 15:34.200
I'm not sure how I want to do this yet, but I will be rolling out feature requests and

15:34.200 --> 15:35.200
content requests.

15:35.200 --> 15:38.680
And they might be different systems, or they might be together, or I don't know exactly

15:38.680 --> 15:39.680
how we're going to do it.

15:39.680 --> 15:44.680
But I see those as two distinct things, a technical thing you want from the Jupiter

15:44.680 --> 15:47.040
Broadcasting Network, like a type of feed.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.200
This feed doesn't work for me because of X so far.

15:49.200 --> 15:53.960
Or I'm trying to build this app, and it would be great if I could get a JSON of X, Y, and

15:53.960 --> 15:59.080
Z shows, versus, hey, it'd be really nice if you had video.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.320
Those are two different requests.

16:00.320 --> 16:05.560
One's a feature request, and one's a kind of like a, I guess they're both kind of feature

16:05.560 --> 16:09.520
requests, versus I'd like you guys to talk about IPFS more.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.040
That's a content request, and that feels like a separate channel.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.200
But I'm not sure.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.160
But whatever we do, we'll do it out in the open.

16:15.160 --> 16:17.880
Whatever code we create, we'll open source it.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.480
And then, if time allows, we'll try to document as best we can.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.000
That's going to be an area that we're a little weak at, but we might be able to get some

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
help.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.160
Yeah, and that's where feedback from you guys telling us where it's weak or what you need

16:27.160 --> 16:29.160
to actually use those tools would be great.

16:29.160 --> 16:33.160
Yeah, so those are things that we're now working on, and I think when we actually have something

16:33.160 --> 16:34.760
to share, we'll talk about it.

16:34.760 --> 16:38.660
And if we end up running into some fun problems or have to build some Linux boxes, I actually

16:38.660 --> 16:41.440
know we're going to be building some droplets to do some of this.

16:41.440 --> 16:44.440
We could talk about all that stuff and the software we're using and the projects and

16:44.440 --> 16:45.440
how they're connecting.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.520
So it could be some good stuff.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.600
We won't overdo it with the podcast stuff, but when we have an interesting thing around

16:49.600 --> 16:53.420
open source and free software to talk about, we'll do it, and I'm looking forward to that.

16:53.420 --> 16:58.240
So those are all things that are sort of coming, and you can check out TechSnap and Linux Action

16:58.240 --> 16:59.920
News to hear something a little different there.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.680
But I think that's all the delays I had.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.000
Did I have any other things I could...

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I don't know.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.880
I mean, do you have anything else to pull out here?

17:05.880 --> 17:06.880
I don't think so.

17:06.880 --> 17:07.880
We could talk about our laptops.

17:07.880 --> 17:08.880
We've got these new ThinkPads.

17:08.880 --> 17:09.880
Oh, yeah.

17:09.880 --> 17:10.880
Oh.

17:10.880 --> 17:15.640
But we should probably talk about the major thing that happened in Linux this week, actually

17:15.640 --> 17:16.640
two major things.

17:16.640 --> 17:17.640
Yeah.

17:17.640 --> 17:18.640
Let's be responsible, I guess.

17:18.640 --> 17:19.640
That's our job as podcasters.

17:19.640 --> 17:20.640
That's what we're here for, right?

17:20.640 --> 17:21.640
All right.

17:21.640 --> 17:28.160
So this week, when Linus was announcing a new RC of the current development kernel,

17:28.160 --> 17:37.180
he added something a little unusual that boiled down to his temporary stepping away of maintainership

17:37.180 --> 17:43.520
of the Linux kernel, which is a rather historic moment in the 20-year history of Linux in

17:43.520 --> 17:44.840
itself.

17:44.840 --> 17:48.720
But his announcement really has been shaking the entire internet.

17:48.720 --> 17:54.640
People are really going all off the walls on this, and he really owns some of his recent

17:54.640 --> 17:58.680
behavior or some of his infamous behavior that's been going on for a while.

17:58.680 --> 18:03.660
He talks about how the discussions both public and on private mailing lists have been building

18:03.660 --> 18:05.060
for years.

18:05.060 --> 18:09.580
Some of these discussions came about recently, though, in probably a more louder tone because

18:09.580 --> 18:17.280
of some recent scheduling snafus around the maintainer summit where Linus had, quote,

18:17.280 --> 18:20.840
accidentally scheduled his vacation to take place.

18:20.840 --> 18:25.000
And then in the subsequent discussions about moving the maintainer summit's location so

18:25.000 --> 18:29.500
that way Linus could attend, it brought some things to the surface.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.000
And he gets into it a little bit.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.780
He says, it's not like this discussion itself is any way new to this week.

18:35.780 --> 18:40.880
We've been discussing maintainership and community for years.

18:40.880 --> 18:45.640
And I think when he uses the term maintainership and community, they're really loaded terms

18:45.640 --> 18:46.640
in this context.

18:46.640 --> 18:51.920
I think what Linus is saying is, maintainership is not just maintaining the code that goes

18:51.920 --> 18:57.360
into the area you're responsible for, but it's also all the human aspects.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.840
And then he brings in community as well.

18:58.840 --> 18:59.840
Right.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.720
I mean, this is a human project made by humans interacting.

19:02.720 --> 19:07.040
And yes, there's like the log of git commits, but everything else that goes before that

19:07.040 --> 19:09.200
actually happens, you also have to manage.

19:09.200 --> 19:14.160
And he's saying the discussion of what that role is and how it interacts with the other

19:14.160 --> 19:17.440
members of the community has been going on for years.

19:17.440 --> 19:18.440
And I see that.

19:18.440 --> 19:19.720
I did some searching around.

19:19.720 --> 19:23.120
I'm sure you could find stuff before this, but I saw conversations in this regard back

19:23.120 --> 19:25.520
in 2009.

19:25.520 --> 19:29.920
And you've seen it if you followed Linux for a while now, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, even,

19:29.920 --> 19:33.040
some of these conversations about Linus's outbursts were being had.

19:33.040 --> 19:38.900
But he says, what's new this week is really my reaction to it and perhaps me being a little

19:38.900 --> 19:39.900
more introspective.

19:39.900 --> 19:42.740
And there's two parts to that.

19:42.740 --> 19:47.520
One was simply my own reaction to having screwed up my scheduling of the maintainership summit.

19:47.520 --> 19:54.880
Yes, I was somewhat embarrassed about having screwed up my calendar, but honestly, I was

19:54.880 --> 19:59.440
mostly hopeful that I wouldn't have to go to the kernel summit.

19:59.440 --> 20:03.680
He didn't want to go to his I mean, his the summit for his his kernel.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.720
Yeah, he didn't want to go to it.

20:05.720 --> 20:10.200
And he kind of is admitting to intentionally booking his vacation.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.960
Clearly there's some psychological factors here to play.

20:12.960 --> 20:16.540
He says, I was mostly hopeful that I wouldn't have to go to the kernel summit that I have

20:16.540 --> 20:20.760
gone to every year for just about the last two decades.

20:20.760 --> 20:26.200
Well, but that whole situation then started a whole different kind of discussion.

20:26.200 --> 20:30.440
And kind of incidentally to that one, the second part was that I realized that I had

20:30.440 --> 20:33.620
completely misread some of the people involved.

20:33.620 --> 20:35.160
That's a big admission.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.000
That is a that is a big admission.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.040
This is where he says the whole look yourself in the mirror moment comes in.

20:40.040 --> 20:45.860
So here we are me finally on the one hand realizing that it wasn't actually funny, or

20:45.860 --> 20:52.240
a good sign that I was hoping to just skip the yearly kernel summit entirely.

20:52.240 --> 20:57.800
But on the other hand, realizing that I really had been ignoring some fairly deep seated

20:57.800 --> 21:00.960
feelings in the community.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.920
He then writes, This is my reality.

21:03.920 --> 21:07.660
I'm not an emotionally empathetic kind of person.

21:07.660 --> 21:10.240
And that probably doesn't come as a big surprise to anybody.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.040
Nope, nope, not at all.

21:12.040 --> 21:16.000
No, I would think we knew he wasn't big on reading others emotions covered it.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.240
In fact, you might almost say it's it was a classic aspect of Linus really.

21:21.240 --> 21:26.600
He says the fact that I then misread people and did not realize it for years of how badly

21:26.600 --> 21:31.740
I've judged the situation and contributed to an unprofessional environment is not good.

21:31.740 --> 21:38.080
This week, people in our community confronted me about my lifetime of not understanding

21:38.080 --> 21:39.840
emotions.

21:39.840 --> 21:45.040
So something happened this last week, he says this week, people in our community confronted

21:45.040 --> 21:48.120
me about my lifetime of not understanding emotions.

21:48.120 --> 21:52.880
My flippant attacks and emails have been both unprofessional and uncalled for, especially

21:52.880 --> 21:55.000
at times when I made it personal.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.100
In my quest for a better patch.

21:57.100 --> 21:58.840
This made sense to me.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.440
I now know this was not okay.

22:01.440 --> 22:05.040
And I am truly sorry.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.240
That reads is genuine to me.

22:06.240 --> 22:09.680
Yeah, I mean, I don't, you know, he's in a position where he doesn't really have to

22:09.680 --> 22:10.680
write.

22:10.680 --> 22:11.680
It's his project.

22:11.680 --> 22:12.680
It's his, you know, he could write whatever he wants.

22:12.680 --> 22:17.080
It's this is really heartfelt, and it's very public, very public.

22:17.080 --> 22:21.600
He knows as he's writing this, every word is going to get quoted in news articles, it

22:21.600 --> 22:26.620
was on CNBC, the entire email, it's going to be all over the web, millions, if not definitely

22:26.620 --> 22:29.980
hundreds of thousands of people will read these words.

22:29.980 --> 22:31.600
And he's owning it right here.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.100
You got to respect that.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.080
That's not an easy thing to do even in private.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.340
Yeah, right.

22:36.340 --> 22:38.560
And he's doing it in a very, very, very public way.

22:38.560 --> 22:44.060
But also, it's a watershed moment for the perception of the Linux kernel team.

22:44.060 --> 22:48.760
You know, I think you could clearly say Linux kernel has been sort of held up high by many

22:48.760 --> 22:50.760
people up on the top of a mountain.

22:50.760 --> 22:56.600
This is the example of a community where your technical contribution is the sole thing that

22:56.600 --> 22:57.600
decides your merit.

22:57.600 --> 23:01.420
And if you submit a shit patch to the kernel, you'll be told it's a shit patch and they'll

23:01.420 --> 23:02.720
yell at you.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.960
And it's not based on the color of your skin.

23:04.960 --> 23:08.200
It's based on the technical merits of your submission.

23:08.200 --> 23:13.520
And this is Linus, the holder of that image saying, that is no longer true.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.960
We must also try to be empathetic.

23:16.960 --> 23:20.840
We must also try to be, in a word, inclusive.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.600
He doesn't use that word.

23:22.600 --> 23:23.600
That's essentially what he's getting at.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.040
Yeah, we'll get to more, you know, that spirit of being excellent to each other.

23:27.040 --> 23:28.040
Yeah.

23:28.040 --> 23:31.520
He says the above is basically a long-winded way to get to a somewhat painful personal

23:31.520 --> 23:35.300
admission that, hey, I need to change some of my behavior.

23:35.300 --> 23:39.640
And I want to apologize to the people that my personal behavior hurt and possibly drove

23:39.640 --> 23:43.280
away from kernel development entirely.

23:43.280 --> 23:47.600
And then he writes it in one short paragraph.

23:47.600 --> 23:52.600
The one that, when I read that Monday morning, I had to take a moment.

23:52.600 --> 23:57.120
He says, I am going to take time off and get some assistance on how to understand people's

23:57.120 --> 24:01.600
emotions and respond appropriately.

24:01.600 --> 24:07.000
He's stepping down as the maintainer temporarily, handing the reins over to Greg KH, which seems

24:07.000 --> 24:09.040
like a huge moment.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.880
I mean, has this happened before?

24:10.880 --> 24:12.640
I don't think so.

24:12.640 --> 24:14.640
I know he's taken vacations.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.640
I know he's got hobbies.

24:15.640 --> 24:19.160
But even then, on his vacation, he's posting RC updates to the mailing list.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.680
Yes, he often does.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.760
He often does.

24:23.760 --> 24:29.320
He is really owning this entire thing and calling himself unprofessional.

24:29.320 --> 24:32.060
He's apologizing to people.

24:32.060 --> 24:35.680
And that, to me, feels like it's going to have ripple effects throughout the open source

24:35.680 --> 24:36.680
community.

24:36.680 --> 24:40.540
And it must also say something about how much he cares about this project and the people

24:40.540 --> 24:43.000
that he's worked so long with to build the project.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.080
Because it's easy enough, especially as the guy at the top, to say, whatever, my way or

24:47.080 --> 24:48.640
the highway, I don't need you contributors.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.680
I'm going to take my colonel over here.

24:50.680 --> 24:53.960
Or it's easy to just back away and never come back.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.840
It really seems like he cares about it and wants to keep contributing and is trying to

24:56.840 --> 24:59.160
find how to do that best.

24:59.160 --> 25:04.120
And I find there's a big disconnect, I guess what I'm trying to say, between what the public

25:04.120 --> 25:07.600
reaction to this has been, which has really spun the whole gamut.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.840
People are freaking out.

25:08.840 --> 25:13.640
I have seen conspiracies about Linus being blackmailed.

25:13.640 --> 25:18.280
And there's even in the GitHub thread about the code of conduct change we're about to

25:18.280 --> 25:23.120
talk about, there's someone offering Linus shelter if he needs to be protected from whoever's

25:23.120 --> 25:24.920
out to get him.

25:24.920 --> 25:28.200
The range of responses to this has been pretty extreme.

25:28.200 --> 25:33.260
But I think Linus sees it in a much more practical sort of way, as he typically would.

25:33.260 --> 25:36.120
He refers it as a pain point.

25:36.120 --> 25:42.160
And I would swap that word pain point, and I would say a transition moment or a shift.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.540
He writes, put another way, when asked at conferences, I occasionally talk about how

25:45.540 --> 25:50.080
pain points and kernel development have generally not been about the technical issues, but about

25:50.080 --> 25:54.300
the inflection points where development flow and behavior changed.

25:54.300 --> 25:58.260
These pain points have been about managing the flow of patches, often been associated

25:58.260 --> 26:03.240
with big tooling changes, like moving from making releases with patches and tarballs,

26:03.240 --> 26:07.700
to discussions about how Linus doesn't scale up to 15 years ago.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.880
Even the ones about using BitKeeper and then having to write Git in order to get past the

26:10.880 --> 26:13.340
point that was no longer working for us.

26:13.340 --> 26:15.040
We have had that kind of pain point.

26:15.040 --> 26:19.680
We haven't had that kind of pain point in about a decade.

26:19.680 --> 26:24.440
But this week felt like that kind of pain point to me.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.680
And I think you could replace the word pain point with that kind of transition, that kind

26:27.680 --> 26:28.840
of shift.

26:28.840 --> 26:32.480
It's a 20 year old project that dominates the world.

26:32.480 --> 26:36.880
It has to have these kinds of changes every now and then, and sometimes they're painful

26:36.880 --> 26:37.880
ones.

26:37.880 --> 26:41.240
Yeah, I mean changing workflows, there's all these human factors that aren't about the

26:41.240 --> 26:45.960
actual commits, how they get there, how you work with them, what gets approved, what's

26:45.960 --> 26:48.960
the dialogue that has to go through to get it approved.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.000
How do you make that work?

26:50.000 --> 26:53.960
And that's going to change when you have 10 contributors or 10,000 contributors and over

26:53.960 --> 26:54.960
time.

26:54.960 --> 27:00.040
And maybe you could argue there was a time where technical excellency was of absolute

27:00.040 --> 27:05.520
importance, especially when you're competing with a lot of cutthroat commercial companies.

27:05.520 --> 27:08.760
And I don't think he's saying it's not of utmost importance.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.640
I haven't seen anything that says that, you know, just because you're nice means your

27:11.640 --> 27:12.640
patch gets accepted.

27:12.640 --> 27:13.640
Right?

27:13.640 --> 27:14.960
That doesn't have to be that way.

27:14.960 --> 27:15.960
Yeah.

27:15.960 --> 27:16.960
Yeah.

27:16.960 --> 27:20.720
It'll be really interesting long term to see if he can stick to this and how long has he

27:20.720 --> 27:21.720
gone for.

27:21.720 --> 27:25.960
He writes about seeing folks at the maintainer summit, but he doesn't really say how long

27:25.960 --> 27:27.840
he's going to be gone either.

27:27.840 --> 27:28.840
Yeah.

27:28.840 --> 27:32.280
So Greg will finish up this kernel and we'll see about the next.

27:32.280 --> 27:33.280
Yeah.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.160
So he just says, yeah, I'll be out for 4.19.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.680
But 4.19 is fairly far.

27:36.680 --> 27:37.760
It's at RC4 right now.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.760
So it's pretty far in the development process.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.640
Something tells me he might not be back for 4.20.

27:43.640 --> 27:45.400
We will just have to wait and see.

27:45.400 --> 27:49.360
And then once he does come back, we have to wait and see if there actually is a tone change.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.360
Yeah, right.

27:50.360 --> 27:51.360
I mean, he's setting this from the top.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.400
How does that filter down through all the levels of contributors and how does that affect,

27:54.400 --> 27:56.880
you know, new people joining the project and how it goes?

27:56.880 --> 28:00.480
Does anybody in the mumble room have any thoughts on the line of stepping down for a bit or

28:00.480 --> 28:03.640
him trying to take care of himself and, you know, fix himself up for a bit?

28:03.640 --> 28:04.640
Yeah.

28:04.640 --> 28:11.880
I mean, given another Libre application summit plug, Cassidy did a talk about technical problems

28:11.880 --> 28:14.480
versus social problems.

28:14.480 --> 28:19.180
And the fact that as technical people, we always want to concentrate on how to solve

28:19.180 --> 28:20.180
things with code.

28:20.180 --> 28:26.640
And sometimes we forget that solving social problems is a often faster and more effective

28:26.640 --> 28:28.560
way to get the results that we want.

28:28.560 --> 28:33.500
So I think it's really important for someone like Linus to say, hey, you know what?

28:33.500 --> 28:38.040
Social problems are actually important too, and we need to really think about the kind

28:38.040 --> 28:41.880
of problems that we're creating for ourselves and not addressing them.

28:41.880 --> 28:42.880
Yeah.

28:42.880 --> 28:48.600
I have at times come on the air and kind of defended the way Linus works because of the

28:48.600 --> 28:51.080
results seem to me to speak for themselves.

28:51.080 --> 28:56.400
But then I kind of, this week when this news came out, I kind of put myself in the position

28:56.400 --> 28:59.480
of, well, what if I talk to my team this way?

28:59.480 --> 29:04.320
What if I just like, you know, just tore you up for doing something, you know, like what

29:04.320 --> 29:07.920
if you made a mistake in land and I just ripped you up for it?

29:07.920 --> 29:10.960
That would not be productive.

29:10.960 --> 29:15.200
There's that element of, you know, it wouldn't fly in a workplace or other professional environment

29:15.200 --> 29:18.080
where you expect to have standards about how people interact with you, even when they're

29:18.080 --> 29:20.080
upset or you're being chastised.

29:20.080 --> 29:23.520
And just because it's an open source project, now maybe if it's, you know, your open source

29:23.520 --> 29:27.580
project that you've been doing for by yourself with for two years in your basement, okay,

29:27.580 --> 29:30.160
you set the standards, but Linux is not there anymore.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.160
Yeah.

29:31.160 --> 29:34.240
And remember, it's, you know, partially governed by that foundation too, which may play roles

29:34.240 --> 29:35.240
in some of this.

29:35.240 --> 29:39.720
Brent, you've noticed a trend though in just project leads sort of stepping back and some

29:39.720 --> 29:41.200
officially, some unofficially.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.200
Yeah.

29:42.200 --> 29:46.800
It feels like maybe once a month on the show here, we talk about someone who's either stepping

29:46.800 --> 29:52.120
back officially or unofficially just to take a break or go travelling or try to find themselves.

29:52.120 --> 29:55.740
I mean, you're kind of taking a little bit of a forced break, aren't you?

29:55.740 --> 30:00.180
So just wondering if, you know, some of these, well, most of the people in the open source

30:00.180 --> 30:04.760
community are so dedicated and yet maybe they're not taking enough time for themselves.

30:04.760 --> 30:05.760
Yeah.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.760
Especially hard when it's a passion project.

30:06.760 --> 30:07.760
Right.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.720
I mean, how many like single person distros do we worry about and talk about because you

30:10.720 --> 30:12.200
see like, well, can they support it?

30:12.200 --> 30:15.200
And when life changes, will there be people to fall back so it keeps going?

30:15.200 --> 30:16.200
Yeah.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.200
Yeah, exactly.

30:17.200 --> 30:22.800
So I hope he is able to take this time and I hope it is productive for him.

30:22.800 --> 30:28.000
I do think it would be good not just for getting more people involved with the project because

30:28.000 --> 30:31.640
it's entirely possible that people have been scared away from contributing to Linux.

30:31.640 --> 30:35.960
It seems to be that's what Greg infers, you know, in a post we're about to talk about

30:35.960 --> 30:39.280
is that people have been scared away from the project, that the existing code of conflict

30:39.280 --> 30:44.140
hasn't worked and Linus has sort of been the representation of that.

30:44.140 --> 30:49.160
But more than that, I think it could be good long term for the reputation of Linux.

30:49.160 --> 30:52.680
I think a lot of times when Linus kind of goes off the handle and then people report

30:52.680 --> 30:56.600
on it, it kind of puts Linux in that amateur light a little bit.

30:56.600 --> 31:00.840
And I think it can be easy to if you are, you know, more thick skinned, you can be like,

31:00.840 --> 31:02.400
well, okay, like I can take it.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.480
I know where Linus is coming from.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.880
I know his intention is just to get good patches.

31:06.880 --> 31:10.200
But it's also easy if you're like, well, I could spend my time, I'm a smart developer

31:10.200 --> 31:14.320
contributing to this project, or oh, I see like all those free BSD guys, they're really

31:14.320 --> 31:15.320
nice.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.320
They don't yell at anyone.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.320
Maybe that's just my preferred work style.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.360
I'm going to go over there.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.400
We do see that actually, we do see that.

31:20.400 --> 31:25.420
And you know, I think what we're about to get into is the second bit of news of Linus

31:25.420 --> 31:30.600
stepping down for a bit and handing the reins over to Greg, that in itself would have been

31:30.600 --> 31:34.540
a huge story for this week that we could talk about all day.

31:34.540 --> 31:40.440
But I think it has to be held in context with also the new change in the code of conduct.

31:40.440 --> 31:45.920
So in the past, the Linux kernel, for not a long time, but for a few years now, has

31:45.920 --> 31:53.480
had a code of conflict that essentially outlined the rules for conflict if it arises.

31:53.480 --> 31:59.560
And this week, submitted before Linus's resignation email, he committed a code of conduct change.

31:59.560 --> 32:03.000
Now the introduction here is written by Greg Kh.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.160
And I think it's important that we get into this.

32:05.160 --> 32:11.920
He writes, the code of conflict is not achieving its implicit goal of fostering civility and

32:11.920 --> 32:14.360
the spirit of being excellent to each other.

32:14.360 --> 32:17.920
So that's Greg right there writing that it's not currently achieving its goal.

32:17.920 --> 32:18.920
It's not working for us.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.840
The code of conflict is not working.

32:20.840 --> 32:25.080
He then writes, explicit guidelines have demonstrated success in other projects and

32:25.080 --> 32:27.600
other areas of the kernel.

32:27.600 --> 32:31.640
I can't speak to any authority if the code of conflict has worked or not.

32:31.640 --> 32:35.320
Greg is in a better position than I to know if they need a code of conduct.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.400
And we're probably going to argue and debate the specifics of what that code might look

32:38.400 --> 32:40.000
like.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.680
But I think it's interesting to see the reasons and the goals that Greg in particular here

32:43.680 --> 32:46.320
and the kernel maintainers are looking for.

32:46.320 --> 32:49.360
He writes, here is a new code of conduct statement for the wider kernel.

32:49.360 --> 32:56.040
It's based on the contributor covenant as described at www.contributor-covenant.org.

32:56.040 --> 32:59.880
From this point forward, we should abide by these rules in order to help make the kernel

32:59.880 --> 33:02.720
community a welcoming environment to participate in.

33:02.720 --> 33:08.000
So to appreciate the new code of conduct, I want to read to you the old code of conflict,

33:08.000 --> 33:09.240
which is just two paragraphs.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.440
It's pretty simple.

33:10.440 --> 33:15.360
It goes, the Linux kernel development effort is a very personal process compared to, quote,

33:15.360 --> 33:17.400
traditional ways of developing software.

33:17.400 --> 33:22.200
Your code and your ideas behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in critique

33:22.200 --> 33:24.040
and criticism.

33:24.040 --> 33:28.960
The review will almost always require improvements to the code before it can be included in the

33:28.960 --> 33:29.960
kernel.

33:29.960 --> 33:34.520
Know that this happens because everyone involved wants to see the best possible solution for

33:34.520 --> 33:37.040
the overall success of Linux.

33:37.040 --> 33:41.640
The development process has been proven to create the most robust operating system kernel

33:41.640 --> 33:42.640
ever.

33:42.640 --> 33:47.360
And we do not want to do anything to cause the quality of submissions and eventual result

33:47.360 --> 33:49.160
to ever decrease.

33:49.160 --> 33:54.000
If, however, anyone feels personally abused, threatened, or otherwise uncomfortable due

33:54.000 --> 33:56.440
to this process, that is not acceptable.

33:56.440 --> 34:01.360
If so, please contact Linux Foundation's technical advisory board or the individual members,

34:01.360 --> 34:03.880
and they will work to resolve the issue to the best of their ability.

34:03.880 --> 34:07.480
For more information on who is the technical advisory board and their roles, please see

34:07.480 --> 34:09.440
and then insert the URL.

34:09.440 --> 34:12.400
That is essentially the entire code of conflict.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.400
Pretty straightforward.

34:13.400 --> 34:17.920
It essentially says be nice to each other, expect to have a few conflicts here and there

34:17.920 --> 34:19.440
because everybody's really passionate.

34:19.440 --> 34:20.440
That's essentially what it's saying.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.440
Right.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.560
You're not going to have, no project this size is going to have no conflicts.

34:23.560 --> 34:24.560
Right.

34:24.560 --> 34:29.640
The rule on how to communicate, it's a set of rules to guide conflict.

34:29.640 --> 34:31.280
That's changed now.

34:31.280 --> 34:37.720
The new contributor covenant code of conduct really lays out the rules and guidelines on

34:37.720 --> 34:40.400
how to communicate within the project.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.180
It starts with a pledge.

34:42.180 --> 34:46.160
The contributor covenant code of conduct starts with this.

34:46.160 --> 34:51.160
In the interest of fostering opening and welcoming environments, we as contributors and maintainers

34:51.160 --> 34:56.780
pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience

34:56.780 --> 34:58.280
for everyone.

34:58.280 --> 35:01.720
Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include using welcoming

35:01.720 --> 35:06.400
and inclusive language, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, gracefully

35:06.400 --> 35:10.600
accepting constructive criticism, focusing on what is best for the community, and showing

35:10.600 --> 35:16.640
empathy towards other community members.

35:16.640 --> 35:21.720
Now I would pause here that so we got inclusive language, which is a bit vague, but being

35:21.720 --> 35:26.800
respectful to different viewpoints and experiences, that is an area that I think is actually pretty

35:26.800 --> 35:27.800
important.

35:27.800 --> 35:33.400
To that end, we may have to consider being inclusive to Linus himself, who perhaps like

35:33.400 --> 35:37.720
some of the many other developers I've met in my life, has a certain type of personality

35:37.720 --> 35:39.280
that is very driven.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.020
It is unempathetic.

35:41.020 --> 35:46.320
It's the kind of personality that has the audacity to think they can create a world-dominating

35:46.320 --> 35:47.320
operating system.

35:47.320 --> 35:52.000
And when he announces Linux, he starts humbly, but just the idea that you could go out there

35:52.000 --> 35:57.120
and create something better than what Bell Labs had made, or what people staffed at universities

35:57.120 --> 36:01.400
getting hundreds of thousands of dollars a year could create, to have the viewpoint that

36:01.400 --> 36:05.480
you could make something better, that takes sort of an absurd personality.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.680
It takes somebody who's maybe a bit obtuse in other areas.

36:08.680 --> 36:13.000
I've met many of developers that are totally normal personalities, totally normal social

36:13.000 --> 36:14.900
lives, all that kind of stuff.

36:14.900 --> 36:18.780
But I've also met a lot of developers that maybe are a bit off socially.

36:18.780 --> 36:21.080
They're a bit off on the personality.

36:21.080 --> 36:25.100
They may even have a personality disorder that prevents them from having all of the

36:25.100 --> 36:27.740
tools necessary to understand someone else's emotions.

36:27.740 --> 36:31.000
And if that is the case, then we must also be inclusive of them.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.200
And Linus may be one of those people.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.200
Right.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.600
I mean, you have people on the thick skin side of things, and you have people on the

36:35.600 --> 36:36.600
thin skin.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.880
And I don't think it's right that either side gets to dictate entirely that they meet on

36:39.880 --> 36:40.880
their side.

36:40.880 --> 36:44.880
We need to find a good way in the middle where you can still be yourself, but there are guidelines.

36:44.880 --> 36:48.440
There are people from way different backgrounds and experiences and styles of communicating

36:48.440 --> 36:50.600
so that you can all work productively together.

36:50.600 --> 36:51.600
Yes.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.760
Now, so far, all of this is pretty common sense.

36:53.760 --> 36:57.080
Nothing really too concerning in any of the language.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.600
Some people can make the argument you don't need to define this stuff.

36:59.600 --> 37:04.320
But I think looking at the discourse of the modern internet, I think it's probably pretty

37:04.320 --> 37:07.380
clear you do need to define some of these things because the internet can be a dumpster

37:07.380 --> 37:09.680
fire of comments and horrible things.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.240
And we certainly see it in other things, right?

37:11.240 --> 37:14.840
I mean, you have these roles when you work for a business or are part of a community

37:14.840 --> 37:16.200
or a volunteer organization.

37:16.200 --> 37:20.120
I mean, even we go to LinuxFest Northwest every year, they have a code of conduct as

37:20.120 --> 37:21.120
well.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.120
Right.

37:22.120 --> 37:27.200
And I think I want to separate out the use of a code of conduct with the specific code

37:27.200 --> 37:28.840
of conduct they have now implemented.

37:28.840 --> 37:29.840
I think those are...

37:29.840 --> 37:30.840
That's important.

37:30.840 --> 37:31.840
Yeah.

37:31.840 --> 37:32.840
They're different things.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.780
And I'll tell you, there's one area, and there's a few in here that concern me, but there's

37:35.780 --> 37:40.200
one area that jumped out at me as a potential issue.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.960
And it's about...

37:41.960 --> 37:42.960
It's two things, really.

37:42.960 --> 37:48.360
The maintainers have the right, it reads, and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject

37:48.360 --> 37:55.580
comments, commits, code, Wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned

37:55.580 --> 38:01.840
to this code of conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors

38:01.840 --> 38:07.320
that they deem, quote, inappropriate, threatening, or offensive or harmful.

38:07.320 --> 38:09.960
Some vagary there, but pretty understandable.

38:09.960 --> 38:11.280
What is inappropriate?

38:11.280 --> 38:12.280
What is offensive?

38:12.280 --> 38:15.200
Those are all things that'll have to be fleshed out as that happens, unfortunately.

38:15.200 --> 38:18.200
The enforcers are going to be key to this thing working, right?

38:18.200 --> 38:19.200
Yes.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.860
The level-headedness that they go with this, the balance that they take, is going to make

38:22.860 --> 38:24.360
or break this thing.

38:24.360 --> 38:27.760
And we are watching a massive experiment now unfold.

38:27.760 --> 38:32.540
We are watching a fairly well-defined, but vague language, code of conduct be applied

38:32.540 --> 38:37.480
to one of the world's most important software projects ever on a massive public scale.

38:37.480 --> 38:41.400
And now we're going to see how it gets implemented and how it gets enforced.

38:41.400 --> 38:45.800
And there is an area where there could be particular chances for abuse.

38:45.800 --> 38:51.300
They write, this code of conduct applies with both within the project spaces and in public

38:51.300 --> 38:55.480
spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.480
Examples.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.480
Now, I like this.

38:57.480 --> 38:58.480
They define the examples of this.

38:58.480 --> 38:59.480
This is good.

38:59.480 --> 39:05.040
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address,

39:05.040 --> 39:09.400
makes sense, posting on an official social media account, like the project's Twitter

39:09.400 --> 39:16.500
account or something, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

39:16.500 --> 39:20.280
Clearly defined, these are public spaces in which this code of conduct is still going

39:20.280 --> 39:21.280
to apply to you.

39:21.280 --> 39:22.280
Right.

39:22.280 --> 39:27.140
But then the next sentence sort of undoes all of those examples and just makes it really

39:27.140 --> 39:29.740
vague and arbitrary.

39:29.740 --> 39:35.560
Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers,

39:35.560 --> 39:41.500
i.e. the people that are in charge of enforcement can decide what qualifies as representation

39:41.500 --> 39:44.560
at the time of enforcement, is how I read that.

39:44.560 --> 39:48.960
And by putting that in there, they completely undo all of the specific examples where you

39:48.960 --> 39:52.600
could clearly define when you're representing the project.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.520
That kind of vagary, I think, can lead to abuse.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.100
I mean, it also depends, I think, how it's applied, right?

39:58.100 --> 39:59.100
You said it really well.

39:59.100 --> 40:01.600
This is a tool for the maintainers in the community.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.520
It can be used poorly or it could be used well.

40:04.520 --> 40:08.040
And if you've defined these things up ahead, maybe there's a new thing you're attending

40:08.040 --> 40:11.520
and the maintainers want you to know that you are going to be a representative.

40:11.520 --> 40:12.520
That's OK.

40:12.520 --> 40:15.440
If after the fact they say, you know, you were really representative there and you didn't

40:15.440 --> 40:18.480
behave correctly, that's where it really could get into trouble.

40:18.480 --> 40:21.160
And who defines what the borders are there?

40:21.160 --> 40:25.960
So say you're part of a project, say you're part of the Clojure project now, and you go

40:25.960 --> 40:29.960
to an event to go to a Clojure booth and you're there representing this project.

40:29.960 --> 40:33.160
Well, let's say later on you decide to go and get a few drinks with some people at the

40:33.160 --> 40:39.900
event and you post a selfie of getting super wasted at a bar on your Twitter feed.

40:39.900 --> 40:41.760
Are you a public representative all of a sudden still?

40:41.760 --> 40:42.760
Like where does the border?

40:42.760 --> 40:43.760
It needs to be really clear.

40:43.760 --> 40:44.760
That kind of stuff.

40:44.760 --> 40:45.760
Yeah, it needs to be discussed.

40:45.760 --> 40:47.800
If that could get you kicked out of the project, you need to be really clear where the line

40:47.800 --> 40:48.800
is.

40:48.800 --> 40:49.800
Right.

40:49.800 --> 40:52.160
And then this also doesn't really discuss what are that, you know, is it your band

40:52.160 --> 40:53.160
the first time?

40:53.160 --> 40:54.160
Are there warnings?

40:54.160 --> 40:57.520
Are you there so that people, you know, have recourse and feel like they're being fairly

40:57.520 --> 41:00.320
treated after being accused of these guidelines?

41:00.320 --> 41:01.320
I don't know.

41:01.320 --> 41:05.040
Eric, you point out it really comes down to who the enforcers are and how they behave.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.600
Yeah, that's that's where my concern lies.

41:07.600 --> 41:12.200
Because if if your enforcers are more thin skinned, then you've you've got a problem

41:12.200 --> 41:17.880
because it seems like a very critical and understood part of I mean, just the development

41:17.880 --> 41:23.200
process is you're you're hanging out at a hack fest or something and and you and two

41:23.200 --> 41:28.320
other developers get into this huge argument over, you know, what sort of encryption screen

41:28.320 --> 41:34.200
encryption scheme to use and you fight it out, you argue about it, and then you come

41:34.200 --> 41:36.920
to some kind of decision and go grab a beer.

41:36.920 --> 41:42.380
But someone who's external to to the community, someone who's external to that that process,

41:42.380 --> 41:48.000
you know, having been there multiple times as a systems engineer, it's part of the process.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
It's almost necessary.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.600
Yeah, especially when people are passionate.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.840
I mean, we could what if this thing quite a bit.

41:52.840 --> 41:56.600
I think but your core point about how the enforcement gets done and who does it, I think

41:56.600 --> 41:59.880
is the takeaway because it's, you know, if they use if they're wise, and they use good

41:59.880 --> 42:02.880
judgment, then it really could be a productive tool.

42:02.880 --> 42:05.220
I think it shows our trust in in that community, right?

42:05.220 --> 42:09.440
Like do we think that the maintainers are are mature people who have in good faith and

42:09.440 --> 42:11.720
care about the community and really do want what's best?

42:11.720 --> 42:14.600
Or are they just going to use this to further whatever agenda that they were going to do?

42:14.600 --> 42:17.920
I'll also say that while this does add some specifics, and as we're talking about, in

42:17.920 --> 42:22.240
some ways, not enough specifics before with the code of conflict, none of this was covered.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.360
And they still had all that power, right?

42:23.360 --> 42:24.600
The maintainers can still do what they want.

42:24.600 --> 42:25.720
They're still in charge.

42:25.720 --> 42:28.600
So we're just getting some more rules that just might not be enough or the right type

42:28.600 --> 42:29.600
of rules.

42:29.600 --> 42:30.600
I'm not big on rules.

42:30.600 --> 42:34.120
You know, the biggest problem with this particular code of conduct that I see is the language

42:34.120 --> 42:39.720
used demands the members of the community are a certain way and holds them to some really

42:39.720 --> 42:41.160
fairly good sounding standards.

42:41.160 --> 42:43.720
But the trouble is overreach tends to creep in.

42:43.720 --> 42:48.720
And a code of conduct should be a document that describes what will get you kicked out

42:48.720 --> 42:52.680
rather than the criteria being allowed for you to stay.

42:52.680 --> 42:53.680
You follow what I'm saying?

42:53.680 --> 42:57.600
So I would, a code of conduct to me should clearly tell you where the boundaries are

42:57.600 --> 43:02.400
and what the repercussions are, rather than defining how you need to behave to stay.

43:02.400 --> 43:06.800
I think there might be room for both just in from the different backgrounds thing, because

43:06.800 --> 43:10.000
the focus really is on, you know, this isn't a place to shoot the shit.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.720
This isn't a place to just have fun discussions with friends like we care about kernel maintainership.

43:13.720 --> 43:14.720
We care about the kernel.

43:14.720 --> 43:17.960
And now I agree that there should be both, that we should be clear about what is totally

43:17.960 --> 43:18.960
not acceptable.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.320
What are the consequences?

43:20.320 --> 43:24.400
But it might be useful in the same way you have, you know, style for your code and the

43:24.400 --> 43:25.920
way your patch has to be formatted.

43:25.920 --> 43:29.880
Maybe there's some amount of rules that can say like, and here's the phrases that are

43:29.880 --> 43:33.920
helpful to us and facilitate a quick and easy discussion of your code.

43:33.920 --> 43:34.920
Yeah.

43:34.920 --> 43:39.800
Yeah, I think the other aspect of the code of conflict, which kind of appealed to me,

43:39.800 --> 43:45.160
and I wonder if there couldn't have been an opportunity to just extend that, is the universal

43:45.160 --> 43:50.800
problem with rulemaking is it is much easier to introduce a rule than it is to remove a

43:50.800 --> 43:51.800
rule.

43:51.800 --> 43:52.800
Absolutely.

43:52.800 --> 43:53.800
Yes.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.280
And it's, you know, you see this everywhere in companies and governments, any bureaucratic

43:56.280 --> 43:57.280
institution.

43:57.280 --> 43:58.280
They never get repealed.

43:58.280 --> 43:59.280
You just add more.

43:59.280 --> 44:00.280
Yeah.

44:00.280 --> 44:03.160
And that's my that's my that's my other kind of concern.

44:03.160 --> 44:06.960
I think, too, you know, there's other there's there's all the obviously other voices RMS

44:06.960 --> 44:11.520
responded to the code of conduct and said, I disapprove of strict codes of conduct.

44:11.520 --> 44:15.600
They feel rigid and repressive to me.

44:15.600 --> 44:16.600
That's what he says.

44:16.600 --> 44:17.600
And I tend to agree with that.

44:17.600 --> 44:18.960
It does feel rigid a bit.

44:18.960 --> 44:19.960
Get it out of here.

44:19.960 --> 44:24.560
He also says, however, since I've never participated in Linux development, the Linux code of conduct

44:24.560 --> 44:25.560
will not affect me.

44:25.560 --> 44:26.560
Of course not.

44:26.560 --> 44:29.160
He says, however, he's never even installed the darn thing.

44:29.160 --> 44:34.240
Yeah, I do know that Linux is a kernel and nothing more Linux kernel is redundant.

44:34.240 --> 44:38.440
And then he goes into the history of the canoe project, which is so classic RMS.

44:38.440 --> 44:40.860
I would have almost been disappointed had he not.

44:40.860 --> 44:46.600
But the core point about what about adopting a different code of conduct, maybe one that

44:46.600 --> 44:49.880
didn't have so much political charge around it?

44:49.880 --> 44:50.880
Yeah, I like that.

44:50.880 --> 44:52.440
I mean, are there ways we can do this better?

44:52.440 --> 44:56.520
How about just a very simple one, which just says, don't be a jerk.

44:56.520 --> 44:57.800
I mean, is that enough?

44:57.800 --> 44:59.720
Well, I think people are saying it is not.

44:59.720 --> 45:02.640
I think I think what Greg was saying is that it was insufficient.

45:02.640 --> 45:05.560
Being excellent to each other did not work out.

45:05.560 --> 45:10.680
But with with great responsibility comes, I don't know, you know, all that kind of

45:10.680 --> 45:11.680
superhero stuff.

45:11.680 --> 45:14.240
I did like I did like Dom Getter online.

45:14.240 --> 45:20.280
He proposed the no code of conduct code of conduct, NCOC for short.

45:20.280 --> 45:23.680
It's a new idea designed to help find communities and projects that will not get stuck endlessly

45:23.680 --> 45:27.040
debating how members should behave.

45:27.040 --> 45:30.680
It's to be adults to each other is the other one.

45:30.680 --> 45:34.720
Gentoo actually has a fairly good code of conduct that I wonder if the Linux kernel

45:34.720 --> 45:36.840
could not have adopted.

45:36.840 --> 45:42.520
I think the core issue here really is that the code of conduct that they chose itself

45:42.520 --> 45:44.220
is very politically charged.

45:44.220 --> 45:49.320
The core author, you know, the primary author of it is a political activist.

45:49.320 --> 45:51.840
And they are sort of a big personality.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.360
They're well known in that circle.

45:53.360 --> 45:56.080
They have a very strong opinion.

45:56.080 --> 46:00.520
And it seems to draw a lot of controversy if they had adopted another community's code

46:00.520 --> 46:05.920
of conduct, or maybe chosen to extend their existing one, and not chosen one that seems

46:05.920 --> 46:08.920
to be one of the most politically charged out there.

46:08.920 --> 46:12.980
And then tied to an author with a bold and loud personality, we may have avoided a ton

46:12.980 --> 46:14.720
of this upset.

46:14.720 --> 46:18.480
And I wonder why that wasn't the direction it almost felt like, ah, hands up, we don't

46:18.480 --> 46:19.480
we don't have time to deal with this.

46:19.480 --> 46:20.760
Let's just go adopt the popular one.

46:20.760 --> 46:24.040
Yeah, I wonder if it was like that, or if it how much how much has this been discussed

46:24.040 --> 46:26.240
behind the scenes that we're not aware of, right?

46:26.240 --> 46:29.240
And like, how much can we spend some energy for everyone who's concerned?

46:29.240 --> 46:32.520
And I think there are legitimate concerns, of course, can we spend that time saying like,

46:32.520 --> 46:33.520
how can we change this?

46:33.520 --> 46:34.520
How can we because it is?

46:34.520 --> 46:36.600
Yes, it does come from a weird background.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.980
But I think it's important to keep in mind that, you know, these are this is they copied

46:39.980 --> 46:42.400
the parts they want and can change it as much as they want, right?

46:42.400 --> 46:45.240
So future commits could make this whatever we need it to be.

46:45.240 --> 46:50.920
There is now though, that looming discussion of is there going to be a fork?

46:50.920 --> 46:57.080
Somebody on the get get post where they announced the new code of conduct says, I would civilly

46:57.080 --> 47:01.240
suggest that this commit, if it's not reverted, then I hope the kernel will be forked and

47:01.240 --> 47:04.720
stripped of this code of conduct and available for distribution package managers for easy

47:04.720 --> 47:10.340
installation and kept in parity with the current kernel, a move such as this will inevitably

47:10.340 --> 47:14.440
not bring about what the code of conduct intends to bring but will dilute contributions to

47:14.440 --> 47:18.760
the project, create more conflict and punish individuals and ex communicate those who have

47:18.760 --> 47:23.560
wrong opinions or politics and push merit aside and bring forth his demise fork the

47:23.560 --> 47:24.560
kernel.

47:24.560 --> 47:28.040
Come on, that's like the most negative possible way of looking at it.

47:28.040 --> 47:31.520
But welcome to the internet, Alex.

47:31.520 --> 47:32.520
Yeah, fair.

47:32.520 --> 47:33.520
Fair point.

47:33.520 --> 47:34.760
Yeah, I agree, though.

47:34.760 --> 47:40.400
It's very like, it's very much it's it's it's all merit based, right?

47:40.400 --> 47:44.360
Like everybody's upset because we're switching from a merit based system now to something

47:44.360 --> 47:45.360
else.

47:45.360 --> 47:49.040
But they're not accepting the merit based decisions of the current leaders at the same

47:49.040 --> 47:50.040
time.

47:50.040 --> 47:53.220
Like if it's if it's merit based, and you like the way it worked, then you should be

47:53.220 --> 47:57.660
accepting of the people in charge's decisions because it's all merit based right now.

47:57.660 --> 47:58.660
So which one is it?

47:58.660 --> 47:59.660
You can't have it both ways.

47:59.660 --> 48:02.240
I like I said earlier, not a fan of more rules.

48:02.240 --> 48:05.580
I generally think what we're doing here is probably going to create more bureaucracy

48:05.580 --> 48:07.360
around the development of Linux kernel.

48:07.360 --> 48:11.560
I also think the Linux kernel is in a market position and maturity where it can handle

48:11.560 --> 48:13.480
this and not be the end of the world.

48:13.480 --> 48:14.480
Right.

48:14.480 --> 48:16.560
I mean, I think it's interesting, too, because it has been you know, this is a change after

48:16.560 --> 48:19.640
a long running project where we see a lot of other projects that have come along and

48:19.640 --> 48:23.840
either added it with much less drama or have just started with it right things like curl

48:23.840 --> 48:29.200
or Kubernetes that are seemingly doing just fine or have massive momentum.

48:29.200 --> 48:32.880
But adding it after the fact after a long community that already has its own norms and

48:32.880 --> 48:33.880
values.

48:33.880 --> 48:34.880
That's it.

48:34.880 --> 48:35.880
That's that can be dicey.

48:35.880 --> 48:38.520
Yeah, it's really going to be about watching where this thing goes.

48:38.520 --> 48:39.520
Yeah.

48:39.520 --> 48:44.600
And these are these agreements and conditions are, you know, they're an aspect of that community

48:44.600 --> 48:49.160
and each community, even with the same language is going to interpret that and handle it differently.

48:49.160 --> 48:55.600
Will we see people getting kicked out, will we see people's people's speech being suppressed?

48:55.600 --> 48:59.400
Or will we see civility improve on the mailing list?

48:59.400 --> 49:02.200
These are all questions that we just won't have answers to until we watch this thing

49:02.200 --> 49:03.200
play out.

49:03.200 --> 49:05.840
And we really won't know until Linus has been back for a while.

49:05.840 --> 49:08.480
And we see maybe new contributors come along.

49:08.480 --> 49:12.120
And we maybe hear from people if it's made a difference or not, we just won't know.

49:12.120 --> 49:15.600
We need stories about like, I wanted to contribute, but I couldn't because of this or, you know,

49:15.600 --> 49:18.480
the reverse people said, like, I didn't want to contribute before, but hey, now I feel

49:18.480 --> 49:22.160
better that I'll be respected and I want to be a part of the community.

49:22.160 --> 49:25.460
It's one of these situations where I think it's worth not overreacting.

49:25.460 --> 49:27.860
It's worth taking a measured approach.

49:27.860 --> 49:31.800
And I don't want to disparage anybody who thinks this is a great idea.

49:31.800 --> 49:34.720
And I don't really want to disparage anybody who has great concerns about this.

49:34.720 --> 49:38.480
And I've heard from all of you, I've heard from those of you who felt like they shouldn't

49:38.480 --> 49:39.480
contribute before.

49:39.480 --> 49:43.480
And I've heard from those of you who believe this will be the end of the Linux kernel.

49:43.480 --> 49:46.600
And you are looking for another boat to jump to.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.960
People are a lot of people are joking that they're gonna switch to open BSD this week.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.960
I've heard a lot of that.

49:51.960 --> 49:53.760
I just think that's all we can do right now.

49:53.760 --> 49:56.880
Yeah, we just have to we just have to wait and see, does the fork become really popular

49:56.880 --> 49:58.240
and that's where the community goes?

49:58.240 --> 50:00.440
Or does the kernel just keep keep on going?

50:00.440 --> 50:04.000
If I had a DeLorean that could get up to 88 miles per hour, I might go back and try to

50:04.000 --> 50:08.680
convince them maybe adopt a different code of conduct just to avoid some of this, even

50:08.680 --> 50:15.060
if it's heavily inspired by 25 years ago or whatever it was when then it's put out 93

50:15.060 --> 50:19.480
on the Dominix mailing list or whatever it was.

50:19.480 --> 50:22.120
Open source was it just was nowhere.

50:22.120 --> 50:25.360
It just wasn't it just wasn't even a thing.

50:25.360 --> 50:30.200
And like Wes said a few minutes ago, you've got projects now like Kubernetes and loads

50:30.200 --> 50:36.120
and loads of other massive open source projects that have been born as a consequence of the

50:36.120 --> 50:38.540
open source movement.

50:38.540 --> 50:43.460
People now have a lot better idea about how to behave and how to conduct themselves in

50:43.460 --> 50:45.360
these scenarios.

50:45.360 --> 50:49.760
I do think, you know, you can't just have an open door and just say, you know, like

50:49.760 --> 50:51.400
I said earlier, don't just be a jerk.

50:51.400 --> 50:54.000
I think there has to be a little more structure to it than that.

50:54.000 --> 50:59.160
But honestly, I think we're at a point now where it's quite well self-policing and governed

50:59.160 --> 51:01.600
as a as a movement, you know?

51:01.600 --> 51:03.600
Yeah, I think that's likely the case.

51:03.600 --> 51:06.440
And I think we'll learn more.

51:06.440 --> 51:10.400
Perhaps we'll learn about the Linux Foundation's role in this change.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.120
You know, that is a good question.

51:12.120 --> 51:16.040
I did notice they are the ones that you report to if you have enforcement issues.

51:16.040 --> 51:19.680
It's tab at linuxfoundation.org, which is a technical advisory board.

51:19.680 --> 51:20.680
So that's interesting.

51:20.680 --> 51:23.520
I would be delighted to learn the back story there.

51:23.520 --> 51:25.720
But I think for now, I'll just leave it to the audience.

51:25.720 --> 51:29.960
Let us know what you think linuxunplug.com slash contact, send us in your thoughts.

51:29.960 --> 51:33.680
The range of it with, you know, I'm trying to soak in as many thoughts and opinions.

51:33.680 --> 51:37.320
This is one of those things where it takes me more than a week to really come to some

51:37.320 --> 51:38.320
sort of...

51:38.320 --> 51:41.000
We're still in the sort of the stunned silence phase of this, right?

51:41.000 --> 51:42.200
It was just like two days ago.

51:42.200 --> 51:45.640
It's been literally just like a day and a half, really, since we've learned about this.

51:45.640 --> 51:47.760
So it's still, you know, I'm processing.

51:47.760 --> 51:50.680
Sometimes I come on in a week or two and my position has changed a little bit.

51:50.680 --> 51:52.560
But I think that's where I want to end it now.

51:52.560 --> 51:56.040
And I'd like to hear the audience's opinion on it, too, on the Unplugged show.

51:56.040 --> 51:59.440
So let's transition to our new goodies that we got this week.

51:59.440 --> 52:03.980
Kind of perks of becoming Linux Academy employees is everybody gets to pick a machine.

52:03.980 --> 52:06.800
And Linux Academy has a policy, you pick your own operating system.

52:06.800 --> 52:10.640
And Wes and I had been kicking around the idea of these ThinkPad T480s, buying them

52:10.640 --> 52:13.320
personally, which was taking us forever because that's got a chunk of change.

52:13.320 --> 52:14.660
You want to make the right choice.

52:14.660 --> 52:16.480
And so they arrived late yesterday.

52:16.480 --> 52:19.240
So Wes is about to unboxes right now on the show.

52:19.240 --> 52:20.380
You ready, Wes?

52:20.380 --> 52:21.380
It's exciting, right?

52:21.380 --> 52:22.800
It's a thin ThinkPad box.

52:22.800 --> 52:27.400
That's the ThinkPad T480 designed for serious business.

52:27.400 --> 52:29.800
And we got it with a couple of extra options.

52:29.800 --> 52:31.020
I love it.

52:31.020 --> 52:33.720
Little theater of the mind there.

52:33.720 --> 52:34.720
Get it out of there, Wes.

52:34.720 --> 52:35.720
Yeah.

52:35.720 --> 52:36.720
It's light, right?

52:36.720 --> 52:37.720
It is light.

52:37.720 --> 52:38.720
Yeah.

52:38.720 --> 52:39.720
Look at this.

52:39.720 --> 52:42.440
No, but it does have a three cell battery built in right now.

52:42.440 --> 52:43.440
It's built right in.

52:43.440 --> 52:47.280
So I'll talk about, I'll tell you why you get your, why you open it up and get your

52:47.280 --> 52:50.320
first impressions on, which I think would be really good.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.480
I'd love to hear, but I'll tell you about the specs.

52:52.480 --> 52:53.480
Okay.

52:53.480 --> 52:54.480
Here's the hardware that we got in these.

52:54.480 --> 52:58.800
So these are the Lenovo ThinkPad T480s, not 480s, people have wondered.

52:58.800 --> 53:00.840
They weigh 3.6 pounds.

53:00.840 --> 53:01.840
This is light.

53:01.840 --> 53:04.220
I mean, I can one hand, I can hold this for hours.

53:04.220 --> 53:07.960
It's got a, we got them with the 14 inch IPS 1080p display.

53:07.960 --> 53:10.520
So we decided not to go 4k on these ones.

53:10.520 --> 53:15.480
I already having used mine for a little bit longer than Wes has obviously, I'm already

53:15.480 --> 53:21.120
very thankful of, of going 1080p because there are certain apps that have never gotten high

53:21.120 --> 53:24.080
DPI that I've really strained my eyes to use.

53:24.080 --> 53:27.000
And now they just look glorious on this IPS display.

53:27.000 --> 53:35.000
It's got an eighth generation I7 8650U, runs at 1.9 gigahertz base, turbo is up to 4.2

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
gigahertz.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.200
Although there's a caveat there.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.200
We'll get into that.

53:38.200 --> 53:39.200
Yeah.

53:39.200 --> 53:42.600
These suckers have 32 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM.

53:42.600 --> 53:48.880
So screw you MacBook with your 16 gig limit, one terabyte PCIe MVNE drives in them.

53:48.880 --> 53:49.880
Oh yeah.

53:49.880 --> 53:53.840
And then the way these Lenovo's work, which is pretty fancy, is as a three cell built

53:53.840 --> 53:54.840
in battery.

53:54.840 --> 53:55.840
They don't call it that.

53:55.840 --> 53:58.320
They call it like a power station because they got to brand it.

53:58.320 --> 53:59.680
It was just silly, right?

53:59.680 --> 54:04.800
But then we also got it with the additional six cell battery that snaps into the back.

54:04.800 --> 54:08.880
So you get the three cell and the six cell combined.

54:08.880 --> 54:13.720
And on my first night of testing, I actually failed to run the battery down, even when

54:13.720 --> 54:16.520
I left it running downloading for a while overnight.

54:16.520 --> 54:24.840
So why right now running plasma neon 1804, I'm estimating about 10 hours of battery life,

54:24.840 --> 54:26.000
10 hours.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.640
That is more than I need.

54:27.640 --> 54:28.640
I mean, that's fantastic.

54:28.640 --> 54:29.640
That's all day battery.

54:29.640 --> 54:32.420
That is all day battery, all work day battery.

54:32.420 --> 54:37.180
It's got Intel wireless in them, and then some of the best parts really is the connectivity.

54:37.180 --> 54:43.160
Along the right edge, there's two USB three gen one type A ports, and one of them is also

54:43.160 --> 54:49.320
a Thunderbolt port where you charge the device over USB-C. HDMI out, it has gigabit ethernet,

54:49.320 --> 54:55.400
a full ethernet jack, audio jack, SD card slot, and the security lock slot that Lenovo's

54:55.400 --> 54:56.400
have.

54:56.400 --> 54:57.400
Yeah.

54:57.400 --> 54:58.400
Did you say that?

54:58.400 --> 54:59.400
It has a headphone jack.

54:59.400 --> 55:00.400
Yeah.

55:00.400 --> 55:01.400
You got to be specific.

55:01.400 --> 55:02.400
I know, right?

55:02.400 --> 55:04.540
It's pretty fricking exciting.

55:04.540 --> 55:07.920
And it's also a certified Ubuntu machine.

55:07.920 --> 55:09.240
Great viewing angles on the screen.

55:09.240 --> 55:10.240
Yeah.

55:10.240 --> 55:11.240
Yeah, it is.

55:11.240 --> 55:15.500
Arch wiki is pretty sparse on this machine because basically everything works with the

55:15.500 --> 55:20.900
exception of a throttling bug that the T480s, as well as several other models of Lenovo's

55:20.900 --> 55:25.220
and even a Dell have, which we'll have the specifics linked in the show notes.

55:25.220 --> 55:31.260
But it turns out there's an issue with throttling that only exists on Linux.

55:31.260 --> 55:34.860
It really comes down to Intel and their crappy data sheets.

55:34.860 --> 55:39.580
The cause is simply that there is an activation offset in the master temperature control target

55:39.580 --> 55:42.280
register, which they flip some bits.

55:42.280 --> 55:48.860
And so essentially the issue is the kernel, it prevents the CPU from boosting all the

55:48.860 --> 55:51.100
way to 4.2 gigahertz.

55:51.100 --> 55:57.740
On some systems it'll go like around 3.5 gigahertz, maybe even 3.9 gigahertz in some cases, but

55:57.740 --> 56:02.820
it won't stay there because of this stupid fricking bug that exists.

56:02.820 --> 56:07.240
It's just part of, it was really a typo on Intel's part.

56:07.240 --> 56:11.760
And as all things in Linux, there's actually a workaround script up on GitHub that will

56:11.760 --> 56:16.340
fix this issue, but it involves turning off secure boot.

56:16.340 --> 56:19.740
It required a couple of, oh yeah, you can't have thermal de-installed to monitor the temperature

56:19.740 --> 56:20.740
stuff.

56:20.740 --> 56:21.740
Oh, okay.

56:21.740 --> 56:23.080
So it's not a perfect fix.

56:23.080 --> 56:27.660
So we are technically limited in max performance right now because of this bug.

56:27.660 --> 56:31.300
And it would require a firmware update on Lenovo's part to fix it.

56:31.300 --> 56:35.160
Now they have released two firmware updates for these machines for Linux.

56:35.160 --> 56:38.220
And we, as we talked about, we should be able to use them right from Linux.

56:38.220 --> 56:39.220
Right.

56:39.220 --> 56:40.940
Cause they're now part of the LVFS project.

56:40.940 --> 56:45.940
So there may be a fix inbound or could try this experimental script.

56:45.940 --> 56:49.220
I'm curious, we'll have to do some benchmarks with this script and really see like, you

56:49.220 --> 56:52.820
know, how much does it really affect and what of, what of our potential workloads will actually

56:52.820 --> 56:53.820
benefit.

56:53.820 --> 56:54.820
Right.

56:54.820 --> 56:55.820
Yeah.

56:55.820 --> 56:57.500
Cause I did some testing with the remote connection software that we use to remote back to the

56:57.500 --> 56:58.900
studio and it did great.

56:58.900 --> 57:00.460
It did better than most laptops do.

57:00.460 --> 57:02.460
So I'm pretty happy with it.

57:02.460 --> 57:04.860
We'll have some additional resources though, if you want to know more about that or read

57:04.860 --> 57:10.580
some reviews for the T480 with Linux, but we're doing things a little differently this

57:10.580 --> 57:11.580
time.

57:11.580 --> 57:15.820
So first of all, one of the things that I really like is that Wes and I got identical

57:15.820 --> 57:16.820
laptops.

57:16.820 --> 57:18.940
And those of you who've listened to the show for a while might know that one of my ways

57:18.940 --> 57:23.500
of achieving like solid production is trying to have duplicates of machines.

57:23.500 --> 57:27.500
So that way we can swap machines if we need to, or swap parts and everything's compatible

57:27.500 --> 57:31.780
or move a hard drive image to another system when it's like a laptop fries and we're live

57:31.780 --> 57:32.780
on location.

57:32.780 --> 57:38.060
You know, there's having two of the machines that you use to get on the air is just, it's,

57:38.060 --> 57:41.700
it's almost a necessity really if you're doing a lot of live broadcasts or a lot of on the

57:41.700 --> 57:42.960
road productions.

57:42.960 --> 57:47.500
And so that was the main driver for us getting exactly identical systems is if Wes and I

57:47.500 --> 57:50.680
are in an event and one of us is having a technical issue that's preventing us from

57:50.680 --> 57:52.920
recording a show, we can, we can part swap.

57:52.920 --> 57:56.200
Or we could just have all the right dongles or batteries or yeah.

57:56.200 --> 58:00.380
If I get a doc here in the studio or another power adapter, you can use it.

58:00.380 --> 58:01.380
Perfect.

58:01.380 --> 58:04.180
You know, there's all those things that are just, I think really, really great about having

58:04.180 --> 58:06.380
two identical machines.

58:06.380 --> 58:11.020
But I, this time around, and I'm curious what you're going to do differently this time around

58:11.020 --> 58:14.100
I'm leaving windows on it, which I never do.

58:14.100 --> 58:17.780
I never do that, but I've shrunk the partition down.

58:17.780 --> 58:23.660
So it's like a 90 gig Linux or I'm sorry, 90 gig partition for windows and then the

58:23.660 --> 58:25.620
rest of the terabyte drive is for Linux.

58:25.620 --> 58:26.620
That's pretty reasonable.

58:26.620 --> 58:30.280
I thought, you know, maybe for some funky firmware thing or maybe some game might come

58:30.280 --> 58:35.340
out someday or some like my Garmin in my RV can only be updated from windows, right?

58:35.340 --> 58:37.780
Maybe a guest has some software they can only use to communicate.

58:37.780 --> 58:40.100
We got to bring them in on windows just that once.

58:40.100 --> 58:41.100
Maybe you never know.

58:41.100 --> 58:44.780
I mean, I really have not needed windows for years, but I just thought if I'm getting a

58:44.780 --> 58:50.520
licensed version of windows pro and I got a terabyte drive, I could burn 90 gigs and

58:50.520 --> 58:52.220
have it there just in case.

58:52.220 --> 58:55.980
Plus, I've now mounted that partition under Linux, which can be kind of handy when using

58:55.980 --> 58:56.980
wine and stuff.

58:56.980 --> 58:57.980
That can be really nice.

58:57.980 --> 58:58.980
Yeah.

58:58.980 --> 59:01.180
So that's one thing I'm doing differently is I'm, I think for now, I don't know if I'll

59:01.180 --> 59:02.180
keep it that way.

59:02.180 --> 59:08.260
I could see myself like reloading this machine and I could see myself blowing windows away.

59:08.260 --> 59:11.220
I mean, at some point, you know, like six months go by and you're like, I just haven't

59:11.220 --> 59:12.220
used it.

59:12.220 --> 59:13.220
Yeah.

59:13.220 --> 59:14.700
The other thing too is you can always shrink it as much as you want.

59:14.700 --> 59:15.700
That's true.

59:15.700 --> 59:17.460
Take a little backup of it and we could keep it on a server somewhere.

59:17.460 --> 59:22.780
So yeah, for factory maintenance or whatever, you can lay that disk image back down.

59:22.780 --> 59:24.100
So that's one thing I'm doing differently.

59:24.100 --> 59:26.340
I also opted not to go Kubuntu.

59:26.340 --> 59:31.820
I decided to go neon 1804, even though still kind of in the testing, I just, I wanted to

59:31.820 --> 59:32.820
be right on that edge.

59:32.820 --> 59:33.820
Yeah.

59:33.820 --> 59:36.580
Well, I like the fresh plasma, fresh hot plasma.

59:36.580 --> 59:38.020
But you get the LTS base.

59:38.020 --> 59:39.020
Yeah.

59:39.020 --> 59:40.020
Yeah.

59:40.020 --> 59:41.020
So those are, what are you doing?

59:41.020 --> 59:42.020
Anything differently?

59:42.020 --> 59:43.020
Are you going to do a different distro?

59:43.020 --> 59:44.020
Are you going to keep windows?

59:44.020 --> 59:45.020
I've been using Kubuntu.

59:45.020 --> 59:49.500
I've been enjoying plasma a lot and it makes a pretty nice, I don't know, GNOME works pretty

59:49.500 --> 59:52.460
well for me for just like terminal and browsing the web.

59:52.460 --> 59:56.140
But when I have a lot of windows open and I really want some like complicated window

59:56.140 --> 01:00:01.380
management or I need to manage multiple workspaces, plasma has a little bit of an edge in just

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.380
extensibility.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.380
Yeah, I agree.

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.380
And you've been using it a lot.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.780
So it'd be nice again, in that same vein, if you need to use my laptop.

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:07.780
It's true.

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:08.780
It's true.

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:12.220
So I was looking at maybe the latest Kubuntu, but you're tempting me with that neon.

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.620
I'm going to be curious what you see.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.860
I mean, I think Kubuntu is so rock solid.

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:19.900
Like if you want a true workhorse, then I think you're, you know, and it's 1804 based

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.900
too.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:21.900
We've also got enough space.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.400
I'm debating, you know, maybe I'll keep windows too.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:28.340
Maybe get like just LTS Kubuntu on there, set up ready to go, all the software we need.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.780
That's like your workhorse distro.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:34.740
Backup workhorse and then have other space for distro of the week and or just whatever.

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:35.740
That's a good idea.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.740
Yeah.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.740
Cause we do that a lot.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.460
I probably should have left a little space on mine cause we do that a fair amount.

01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:44.660
In fact, I was thinking about giving project Trident to go for a week, you know, just live

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:45.660
on project Trident.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:49.740
I am debating some, some ZFS on root for this guy.

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:50.740
Yeah.

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.740
We'll see.

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:52.740
That'd be fun to hear.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.740
Yeah.

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:56.300
So, you know, we've already kind of covered it, but we also wanted to call out what's

01:00:56.300 --> 01:01:02.500
important to us when designing and building and then selecting and purchasing a work machine.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:06.180
Because if this was a machine for me just to bop around the RV or something like that,

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:11.660
I may have gone with an XPS 13 or maybe a Gallego.

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:16.580
Like I don't think I would have necessarily picked a ThinkPad T480 for my personal, just

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:21.220
like stick it on the couch and use it for browsing the internet just for fun.

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:26.180
But when it came to a work machine, I needed these quote unquote legacy ports that all

01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:31.700
of my current audio hardware uses, USB-A, ethernet to transfer multi-gig files.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:32.700
Yes.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:35.020
And I mean, just for live streaming, you can't beat ethernet.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.020
Yeah.

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:42.020
So I was able to pick the whole package, 14 inches, 3.6 pounds, 10 hours of battery life,

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.260
which even if in heavy production, that works out to be five or eight, I'm fine.

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.260
Fine.

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.260
Yeah.

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:49.260
That's huge.

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.260
Yeah.

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:51.260
They're not the most beautiful.

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:54.180
I think they have their own sort of elegance, but you can tell they're while light, they're

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:55.180
rugged.

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.460
You know, they've been building ThinkPads for a long time.

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.740
They do feel rugged.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:01.740
With those batteries, don't forget, you can do the Noah Choliatt trick of pulling one

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:05.180
out and shoving a new one in and it doesn't have to reboot or anything.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.300
It keeps going because that built-in 3.7 keeps going.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.300
It's great.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.180
How'd you find the nipple in the middle of the, they call it a track point, don't they?

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:12.180
How'd you find that?

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.180
Yeah.

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:14.180
You know, I've used it a bit.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.180
It's not bad.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:16.180
I kind of actually like it.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.860
The track point is decent.

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:21.200
The track pad is one of the better ones on a PC laptop.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:23.380
It's got some grit to it.

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:25.820
And it's one of those where you click the whole track pad.

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:27.760
I don't like that part too much.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.580
So that's why I've sort of been preferring the nipple.

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.580
Yeah.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.100
I have more experience with the Dell's version of the nipple, but I do kind of like it.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.100
It's nice.

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.100
It's a great thing.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.860
But when you're just using the mouse, you want to go real quick, it can be handy.

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.180
It's nice too, because I disabled the track pad as soon as I connect my Bluetooth Logitech

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:47.380
MX, which I love the Logitech MX Anywhere series of mice.

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.340
They're the best mice for a laptop.

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.360
And so I keep one in my bag.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.300
And so as soon as I connect that, I have the track pad disabled.

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:56.660
So that way I don't ever have any like mistaken touches while I'm typing.

01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:02.820
That keyboard is the best keyboard I've used in a laptop in probably seven, eight years.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:03.820
Yeah.

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:04.820
Decent travel.

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:05.820
Great for broadcasting.

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.140
It feels good on the fingers.

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:13.780
And I have RSI issues, and the MacBook keyboard triggers them, because I'm an old man now.

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:14.780
I just type really heavy.

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:16.700
I'm used to mechanical keyboards.

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:19.180
I grew up on the IBM PS2s and things like that.

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:21.140
So I was clank, clank, clank, clank, clank.

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.580
And I smashed my fingers into the MacBook, and I have to constantly remind myself, don't

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:25.580
type so hard.

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.580
But when I get going, I just get going.

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:27.580
You just get going.

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:28.580
You're passionate.

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.580
Not an issue on the ThinkPad.

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.580
Not an issue at all.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:33.700
It's one of the best laptop keyboards I've felt in a really long time.

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.060
And so what are your first impressions of it?

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:36.460
Now you've had it out of the box for a moment.

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:37.460
What do you think?

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.460
I like it.

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.100
I think this is going to be just a really good...

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:43.540
It's not flashy, but it just feels like I can sit down, I'll know that it's going to

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:47.100
boot up, it's going to be ready to go, and it's got the guts to perform when we need

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:48.100
it to.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.100
Yeah.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.100
Yeah.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:52.980
And I also want to talk a little bit about some of the tweaks that we're going to make

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.980
to the machine to use it in production.

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:59.260
Both Wes and I have been experimenting with a project called KX Studio.

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:04.580
And KX Studio is like a series of packages or repos that you can overlay on your distribution

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:08.220
and bring in a bunch of cross-platform pro audio applications.

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:13.100
It's a huge collection of different ones, specifically some that are used to set up

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:19.380
jack audio, which I'm just beginning to really wrap my head around because for a full mobile

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:23.460
machine where I'm recording my microphone and I got a soundboard and I'm recording my

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:27.340
remote host and all of that, I got to use something more sophisticated than just straight

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:28.340
pulse audio.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:31.860
I can start creating virtual sound devices and capturing them to specific files.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.860
Yeah.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:36.460
I mean, when you think about all the equipment we've got up here in the studio, it's a challenge

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.580
to get all of that working in a laptop.

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:43.540
We've done it before, but not with jack, but we've done it before using external audio

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.500
devices and sophisticated routing.

01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.740
And the goal here is to do it all in software.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:48.800
We'll see.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.300
We have members that join us in the mumble room fairly frequently that are using jack

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.940
audio with reliability and have great things to say about it.

01:04:55.940 --> 01:05:01.100
And there are tools with jack audio that allow you to draw a connection from one audio device

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:05.240
to another audio device, like you're patching wires and it's a visual thing.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.260
It's really cool.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:09.380
The applications like Katina or something like that.

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:10.380
Do you remember?

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:11.380
I know you've been playing with it.

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:14.980
I mean, there's, there's several, there's the whole, the, like the cadence suite of

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:15.980
applications.

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:16.980
Cadence.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:17.980
That's what it was.

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:18.980
Yes.

01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:19.980
Cadence.

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:20.980
And cadence itself is like a nice gooey that'll help you get jack all set up.

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:24.500
It's got stuff like, you know, also impulse bridges built into it.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:30.220
And then Cadia, C-A-T-I-A, is the jack patch bay software that lets you drag and draw to

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:31.220
different devices.

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:35.260
And it really is such a nice model, you know, where you, you get these jack clients and

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:38.580
they show up and you've got inputs and outputs and then you can just connect them however

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:40.540
you want and jack handles the rest.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:44.700
And our favorite recording software that we use now under Linux to record a podcast, Reaper,

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.020
has full support for jack devices.

01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.020
Oh, it works so nicely.

01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.900
So they show up as input channels.

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.900
It's just brilliant.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:53.580
So I can, I could, you know, have a jack device that is just my microphone and I can record

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.060
that as a separate track in Reaper.

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:59.140
I can have a jack device that's just when he's remote or if I'm remote and that goes

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.140
on a channel.

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:03.340
I mean, the potential is, is, is huge.

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.540
And that's one of the tweaks we're going to be making.

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:11.060
I've got the KX studio repositories, I've got Cadia and a few other things installed,

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.780
but I don't really have not really wrapped my head around how to actually create virtual

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:16.300
in and out devices and stuff like that.

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.640
That's like the next stage I'm going to be going to.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:22.260
But my hope is in a month or two, I've got this thing down pretty well.

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:25.300
And KDE neon is going to be stabilized by then.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:29.900
And I'm going to have a pretty sore, serious remote mobile workstation that's fans don't

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.700
kick up when I connect back to the studio.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:32.700
Right?

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:33.700
Yes.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:36.460
And I think, I mean, I think some of the KX studio 1804 repos are also stabilizing a bit.

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.540
So you know, wait and see, not everything's going to be perfect.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.260
It does make me think too, we need to, you know, we should do, we'll try to do a good

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:45.360
job documenting this too, because I know, I mean, it'd be good for you guys to see,

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.500
but also on our end, if we just need to redo something really quick, we don't want to be

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.500
futzing with it.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.500
Yeah.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.740
I don't want to make it like a holy install that I can't touch.

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:52.740
No, no, no.

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:53.740
Absolutely not.

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:54.740
Got to be able to nuke and pave and reset it up.

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:58.780
And I think we can get there because it just puts it around you and I have made some progress

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.420
just, you know, individually.

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.420
Very excited about it.

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:05.540
They're just, they just, you know, I use the machine all night and all day yesterday.

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:06.840
It came at noon.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.620
So I got it at noon yesterday and just immediately went to work.

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:11.620
Tore right into it.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:12.620
Yeah, of course.

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:13.620
Oh my God.

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:16.080
So I booted into windows for the first time just to like log into my account that Linux

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:19.620
Academy had created and, and you know, log in and do any of those firmware updates, but

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:23.260
they'd all, they'd taken care of all that, but I was just curious, you know, he's like,

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.260
what's this like?

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.260
What's this environment like?

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:26.260
It's so bad.

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.980
Windows, like when you search for windows update in the start menu, you get like everything

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.040
but windows update.

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.380
You get like the windows update settings and windows update hours and all these things

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.740
that are not windows updates.

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.020
Just actually doing the updates.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.020
Yeah.

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:41.620
If you write check for updates, then you get, I mean, it's just, windows 10 has got so much

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:42.740
going on.

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:47.340
It's been blurking at me with OEM messages and blurking at me with, with Microsoft messages

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:51.860
about installing defender when I first logged in, my CPU was completely pegged for like

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.860
five minutes.

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.020
And so I launched, you know, I do control it, delete to go use the new task manager,

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:59.520
but now they've got a baby task manager that brings up, so I got to click something else

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:01.500
to get a decent task manager now.

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:06.020
And then I look at it and 98% of, or it was two CPUs or something that's just completely

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:11.020
being dominated by the windows defender doing a malware scan of my system because apparently

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.580
the first login of my account ever was the time to do that.

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:15.180
That's what you want as your first run experience.

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:18.660
So I, you know, I opened up the machine literally the first time I log in, the fans are going

01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:19.660
like crazy.

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.260
Like, there's so much stuff going on.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.420
I'm like, this is awful.

01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:25.040
This is, this is horrible.

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.620
Could not download that KDE neon 1804 preview ISO fast enough.

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:29.620
How did that install go?

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:30.620
Oh, beautiful.

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.620
Beautiful.

01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.620
Secure boot worked fine.

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:33.620
Oh yeah.

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:34.620
Oh yeah.

01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:35.620
Secure boots on using UEFI.

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:36.620
No problem.

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:40.700
The only thing that was a little tricky was, you know, I decided to install G parted to

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:47.060
shrink the partition because I just find that the cute unity ish, whatever that ubiquity

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:51.940
installer is that they're using for Kubuntu and KDE neon, the partition is just, it's

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:52.940
not great.

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:53.940
Like the fields are too narrow.

01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:54.940
You got to expand it all out.

01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:57.940
You always got to, you got to stretch the window out and make it bigger.

01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:00.340
And then you got to click on the partition and click change.

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.340
You can't just double click.

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:02.340
It's just dense.

01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:05.500
It's just hard to be G parted for just getting some serious disk work done.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:09.900
I flipped over G parted, did some of my heavy lifting there, resized the NTFS partition

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:14.020
there, did a safety reboot back into windows to make sure everything was good, booted back

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:15.020
into the neon installer.

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.980
And then it just did the installation like normal.

01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:17.980
Went flawless.

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:18.980
Beautiful.

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:22.860
And since, since neon has been installed, man, it's just been beautifully fast.

01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:25.340
Like it's just incredibly fast boot.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:26.340
I got it all.

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:28.780
I got plasma totally customized the way I like it in an evening.

01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:30.460
And this is with like all your electron apps.

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:31.460
Oh yeah.

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:34.620
I'm running Slack and I'm running mail spring and I'm running telegram and I'm running all

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:39.180
that stuff all the time and each using KDE windows rules, they're assigned to their specific

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:43.020
windows, their desktops and with specific window constraints.

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.620
And it's just great.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:45.620
It's just great.

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.620
Super fast.

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:50.620
I installed a couple of steam games, you know, doing all this stuff while we're on, on battery.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:52.260
I didn't even take my power adapter home.

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:54.260
I was like, let's see what this laptop can do.

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:55.820
Oh, you're living on the edge again.

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:56.820
Yeah.

01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:00.800
After playing on the machine all day, I disconnect the USB power adapter and I grabbed the laptop

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.580
and I go home power adapter free.

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.420
And I'm like, I'm going to see if I can make it all night.

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.820
I was up till 10 30.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:07.180
I mean, I got home.

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:10.740
I use that machine through dinner, through watching deep space nine.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.700
Like I did not move from that machine all night.

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:16.500
My, you know, my situation sort of precludes me moving a lot anyway.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.080
So I sort of stay put anyways.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.760
And so I'm sitting there working on that machine all night on battery, installing software,

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.100
you know, snapping stuff up, like just going nuts and downloading games and trying them

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:27.440
out.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.380
And I ended the night by, by just letting the machine continue to download software

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:32.380
for another 90 minutes.

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:36.100
And I just turned the screen off and I went to bed, came back, it had, you know, dutifully

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:41.300
gone to sleep, but it finished all the downloads and I look at things still has 27% battery

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:45.420
and it's still telling me three and a half hours left of, of charge.

01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:46.420
Oh, I'm excited.

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:49.900
I know it was really something like, I didn't know I could accomplish that in Linux.

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:51.820
Like I didn't know that was going to be possible.

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:52.820
So that was really neat.

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:54.660
That was a really great first impression.

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:58.320
And the fact that the machine just was never a slouch, you know, just kept up with everything

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.320
I was doing.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.500
I think having MV&E drives really helps with that.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:05.660
And then having that I seven, do you have a USB-C charger pack for it yet?

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:06.660
Yeah.

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:07.660
That's what it comes with.

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:08.660
Yeah.

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:09.660
It comes with a USB-C.

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:10.660
Really?

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:11.660
Yeah.

01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:12.660
It's like a 65 water.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:13.660
And I guess you can get up to like a hundred Watts or something.

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:14.660
If you get the doc.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:15.660
Yeah.

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:18.100
Cause they, they used to, the four seventies is the one that I have and they still came

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:22.820
with the square Lenovo tip, but the CS480 has USB by default.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:23.820
All in.

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:26.740
And that USB-C port is also a Thunderbolt three port as well.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:27.740
So.

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:28.740
Yeah, it is.

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:29.980
Oh, that's beautiful.

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:30.980
Very excited about this.

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:34.460
Once you figure out how all the cables work in that weird domain, that just the possibilities

01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:35.460
are endless.

01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:36.460
They were fully spec'd.

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:41.780
They were close to $1,800, you know, but that's still significantly cheaper than a Mac book.

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:42.780
Significantly cheaper.

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:43.780
For the value we're getting.

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:44.780
I mean, well worth it.

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:45.780
Yeah.

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:46.780
Very happy with it.

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:49.860
So the kick in the tires and I'm sure eventually I'll probably load some other distros on there

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:50.860
and stuff like that.

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:54.620
But really looking forward to just building a rock solid mobile recording studio in a

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:55.620
laptop.

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.620
Yeah.

01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:57.620
If you guys have tips, let us know.

01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:58.620
I mean, some of you have been using Jack out there.

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:02.380
Maybe you've got some things we really shouldn't miss when getting that set up or I'm a new

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:03.380
ThinkPad user here.

01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:04.380
I mean, I've played with them before.

01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:07.140
I had a really old one back in the day, but I'm new to this.

01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:09.500
So if there's like ThinkPad things we need to do, I'd like to know.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:16.820
I would go as far as to conjecture, and this may be hopeful thinking, but you almost have

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:21.140
to believe that Lenovo has done work to make sure this works under Linux.

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:25.660
Because when you look at like the Ubuntu Wiki and the Arch Wiki, they basically say everything

01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:26.660
just works out of the box.

01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:30.580
And like when you read people's reviews for the current T480s, like everything just works.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.160
All the hardware just works.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:35.700
And then you look at the work they've done with LVFS recently, I think there's more going

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:36.700
on.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.700
There's some playing ball happening that maybe they're not so public about.

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:39.700
Yeah.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:42.160
And one of the things that really drew me to the T480 is I think Alex and others had

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:46.860
told me that, you know, there's a lot of folks at Red Hat using this particular model of

01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:47.860
ThinkPad.

01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.100
And I thought, okay.

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.100
They know what they're doing.

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:51.100
Yeah.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.220
Maybe they're hip to what Lenovo is actually doing behind the scenes.

01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.860
You know, they could be having those business to business conversations and Red Hat could

01:12:55.860 --> 01:13:00.700
say, hey, we'll buy 10,000 of those if you can make sure it does XYZ okay for us.

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:01.700
Yeah.

01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:07.140
So Wes, you were saying anything specific to ThinkPads and Linux?

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:11.780
There's a website, thinkwiki.org that has some interesting stuff.

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:13.540
I dropped a link in IRC for you.

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:14.540
Oh, we'll check that out.

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:16.500
I'll try to toss that in the show notes too.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.500
Yeah.

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.220
I think it was a good choice.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:23.620
It's not like you've said, it's not the most flashy laptop you could find, but I think

01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:25.100
it's a really practical solution.

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:28.340
And if you're on the fence out there about what machine to get, I really endorse this

01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:29.340
machine.

01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:32.900
It's pretty fantastic and it's nice to see everything just working out of the box.

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.540
The one thing I'm a little worried about, I've read that plasma users have issues with

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.400
the Thunderbolt security model.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.720
You may recall, we recently covered that Gnome added support for user prompting to authorize

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.340
Thunderbolt devices when you plug them in.

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:50.180
I mean, these suckers are sitting on your PCI bus and plasma does not yet have the facility

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:53.500
to authorize and prompt you to authorize them.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:57.940
And I have read, cannot confirm yet, but I have read that if Thunderbolt security is

01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:03.620
turned on, that as a plasma user, you have to log out and log into Gnome 3 and then authorize

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:08.460
the device, like a doc or whatever it is, then log out of Gnome and log back into plasma.

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:11.180
And you have to do that every time you change a device.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.380
That sounds horrible.

01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:15.620
And so what I did is I just turned off Thunderbolt security in the BIOS, which is actually an

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:16.620
option.

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:20.780
I don't know what all the ramifications of that are other than exposing my PCI bus, but

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:25.180
I'm going to, your RAM is mine now Chris, you better watch those ports.

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:26.180
Who needs Heartbleed?

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:27.980
Wes will just plug in.

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:31.900
So yeah, I made that choice for now, but I'm hoping the plasma project just did a great

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:33.460
support for that security authorization.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:34.460
Yeah, they probably,

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:37.120
Something we'll cover I'm sure right here on Linux Unplugged.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.120
Very fun though.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.300
It's great to get new machines, especially ones that we had been kind of thinking about

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.820
anyways for a while.

01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.380
And I'll be really curious to hear your report after you get it loaded and run.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:48.460
I do think a nice Linux Unplugged sticker is going to look great on the back.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:49.460
I like the way you're thinking.

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:51.780
I like that, Wes, I like that.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:55.740
So if you've got any experience with machines like this or other tips like the Lenovo Wiki,

01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:58.420
let us know, linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:01.180
You can also grab our RSS feed that way you get every single show.

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:06.900
It's just linuxunplugged.com slash RSS and you plug that in to whatever reader or downloader

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:07.900
you like.

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:08.900
You got, oh, look at that.

01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:09.900
It's already in the show notes.

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:10.900
Boom.

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.900
Very nice.

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:12.900
All right.

01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:14.300
Well, go get more Wes over at TechSnap.Systems.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:18.500
Catch him on the recent episodes of Linux Action News as well.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.180
It's some great Wes Payne episodes.

01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:21.180
Thank you, sir.

01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:22.580
Stepping up, hitting it out of the park.

01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:25.540
It's nice to have you here full time now and I think it's already paying dividends.

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:26.540
It sure is.

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:29.140
Well, so go get more Wes and we'll be back next week.

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:34.780
I am probably still going to be for a while, at least a couple more weeks, kind of taking

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:35.780
it easy.

01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:37.300
Try to be here on Tuesdays for this show.

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.580
Going to try to make it for Coder later this week, but that's probably about the most I'll

01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:41.980
be doing for the next few weeks.

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:42.980
I'm still there though.

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:46.300
Still working every single day, still checking in on stuff, making sure Wes doesn't ruin

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.300
everything.

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.300
I need a lot of supervision.

01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.300
Yeah.

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:50.300
Yeah, that's for sure.

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:53.740
But in the meantime, that will bring us to the end of this week's show.

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.420
I encourage you to join us.

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:59.300
We got that open mumble room where you can comment and participate in the virtual lug

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:01.540
and that goes before the show and after the show.

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:02.860
We often hang out and chat a bunch.

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:03.860
We have a great time.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:04.860
It really is fun.

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:10.260
And I have a strong sense that an unplugged barbecue is in our future.

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:13.100
When I've recovered, I can move around a little bit better.

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.420
I think I can smell it already.

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:15.420
Yeah.

01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:17.460
I feel like an unplugged barbecue is in our future.

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:23.540
So stay tuned for details on that and hit me up on telegram, telegram or Jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:24.780
slash telegram.

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:27.540
Join our group and let us know your ideas for a barbecue.

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:28.540
Join us live next week.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:55.100
In the meantime, we'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:16:58.540 --> 01:17:04.260
Oh, the unplugged show.

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:06.300
There we go.

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:07.300
Oh, yeah.

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:08.300
All right.

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.300
We got to title this thing.

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.460
We ran right up to the Ask Nor program this week.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.460
So it's a big show.

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.460
It was a lot to cover.

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:14.460
I really did half.

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:15.460
You did half of it twice.

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:16.460
People don't know.

01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:17.460
But we did.

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:18.460
Yeah.

01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:22.620
The recording stopped and we had to redo part of the show, which was never fun.

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:23.620
But we got through it.

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:24.620
We got through.

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:25.620
Here we are now.

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:26.620
Super impressive.

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:27.620
You guys did awesome.

01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:29.740
I feel like I was listening to it for the first time.

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:30.740
Well, good.

01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:31.740
Good.

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:32.740
Yeah.

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:36.940
You know, when I saw that Linus news, like I literally had to sit with it for the morning.

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:41.740
Like it, it, it, I guess I didn't realize how much it would have impact me.

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:42.740
Yep.

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:43.740
It was hard.

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:44.740
It was hard to write.

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:45.740
You couldn't just like chew on it immediately.

01:17:45.740 --> 01:17:46.740
You had to let it percolate up.

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:47.740
And I just kind of just posted the link somewhere.

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.820
I would look at them later and came back to it.

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:52.600
I was going to mention it didn't quite make it into the news.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:56.300
But those of you out there that are running Windows and my stats show it's a fair percentage

01:17:56.300 --> 01:18:01.380
of you, our friends over at Microsoft and Canonical have a new baby.

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:06.680
There are now optimized Ubuntu desktop images available for Hyper-V in the Hyper-V gallery.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.500
And it's kind of legit.

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:13.280
They've, they've integrated XRDP upstream to add support for enhanced session mode.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.320
They've improved clipboard integration.

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.100
There's dynamic desktop resizing support.

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:22.600
And there's also now support for shared folders for the hosting guest file transfer and a

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:26.620
much improved mouse experience and it's easy to move between the host and the guest desktop

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:27.620
window.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:28.620
Nice.

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:32.180
I mean, if you're on professional, you might not really need VirtualBox anymore.

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.180
That's what I mean.

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.420
If you're a Windows, yeah, if you're a Windows 10 user on Pro and you've got Hyper-V, they've

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:42.020
now got this Hyper-V gallery where you can just install 1804 optimized for Hyper-V. I,

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:45.540
you know, I could try it on my new Windows partition actually and see how it goes.

01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:50.540
I hadn't really realized that, but I could actually try like Windows subsystem now and

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:51.540
this.

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:52.820
No, careful, careful.

01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:53.820
Once you taste it.

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:55.720
But that's negative in the freedom dimension.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:56.720
Is it?

01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.720
Is it?

01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:58.720
I have a hard time.

01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.720
And the value of this is negative.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.220
I can't really figure that out.

01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:02.220
Like it's.

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:05.020
Or is it like a surreptitious freedom injection into that proprietary universe?

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:06.020
Right.

01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.020
It's like a beachhead.

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:08.020
Like it's like a Trojan horse.

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.020
We are the wedge.

01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:22.340
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.
