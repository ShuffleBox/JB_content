00:00.000 --> 00:09.640
This episode is probably going to sound like hell because there's really no way to remove rain from a recording like this because it's it's a variable rain.

00:09.640 --> 00:13.200
We are in just the middle of what they call a bomb cyclone.

00:13.280 --> 00:18.100
We're actually the tail end of it now and it has been dumping just for days.

00:18.100 --> 00:22.420
We've had a literal atmospheric river over the Pacific Northwest for days.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.400
There's no way for me to record without some kind of weather sound, especially because I'm out in the woods.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.400
And it's kind of a special out-in-the-woods trip too.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.400
Hey Chris, did you do a rain dance at all?

00:33.400 --> 00:37.400
My podcast dance and my rain dance are kind of the same dance.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.400
I'm not very good at it and I think that must have been what happened.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.400
I think it might be time for you to try the other one.

00:50.400 --> 00:54.400
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.400
My name is Chris.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.400
My name is Wes.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.400
And my name is Brent.

00:57.400 --> 00:58.400
Hello, gentlemen.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.400
This episode is brought to you by a cloud guru, the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux and other modern tech skills.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.400
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands on labs.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.400
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru dot com.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.400
Well, this show is going to be an interesting one.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.400
It could just be a total disaster.

01:13.400 --> 01:22.400
And we are all going to find out together live because there's a lot of technology that's brand new layered on top of this episode.

01:22.400 --> 01:36.400
Starting in front of me, we've got a Fedora 35 workstation wired up with pipewire that is routing audio between myself, Wes, Brent, the mumble room, OBS, all of it happening in a rather fragile setup.

01:36.400 --> 01:48.400
But what's even more exciting, that is connected to a Starlink dish, which is broadcasting this to the world via space.

01:48.400 --> 02:05.400
And the entire pipeline from my broadcast machine to the dish, to the satellites, to the ground stations that receive the signal, to even the systems that bridge the ground systems to the Internet all run Linux.

02:05.400 --> 02:14.400
I had a great opportunity to learn a little bit about how Starlink is set up, just scratch the surface kind of details, but fascinating nonetheless.

02:14.400 --> 02:20.400
So we're going to share those Linux details about Starlink today and I'm going to give you a review of my impressions.

02:20.400 --> 02:24.400
I have been out in the woods during this crazy storm.

02:24.400 --> 02:29.400
This today will be the fourth day I got out here and of course had to find the right spot.

02:29.400 --> 02:34.400
Took me a little while, had to navigate around because I needed a good shot of the sky.

02:34.400 --> 02:43.400
I got Starlink going and I've been monitoring everything from its performance, its latency, even the power draw because I'm running all of this off grid.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.400
So we're going to talk about that in the show today.

02:45.400 --> 02:53.400
Of course, we've got some community news, some Ubuntu concerns we want to share with you, some pics, some feedback and a lot more.

02:53.400 --> 02:58.400
So before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

02:58.400 --> 03:01.400
Hello, mumble room. Hello.

03:01.400 --> 03:06.400
Hello. I don't have the little counter for mumble, so I actually don't have the count today, but thank you for making it.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.400
Welcome in over Starlink.

03:08.400 --> 03:19.400
Please excuse any kind of weird hiccups because not only is there a storm going on right now and I'm broadcasting from space, I'm pushing this thing.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.400
We have two different remote audio feeds for Wes and Brent.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.400
We have the audio feed for mumble.

03:25.400 --> 03:30.400
Plus, we have every device in my RV that's connecting and communicating to the Internet.

03:30.400 --> 03:36.400
And I'm live streaming to multiple endpoints via OBS.

03:36.400 --> 03:42.400
So if you you can just imagine that is a lot of send and receive happening over this dish right now.

03:42.400 --> 03:48.400
It's a very precarious setup, not to mention the software is technically in an unreleased state still.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.400
So please excuse any oddities, but this is a real try it.

03:52.400 --> 03:58.400
We're doing this by the seat of our pants episode to really put the technology in production and see how it holds up.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.400
So it's going to be a real make it or break it kind of thing.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.400
And that in itself will be part of the review.

04:03.400 --> 04:13.400
But we recently had a review on the show and Brent West and I were talking about this after the show and we felt like maybe something didn't go very well.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.400
We didn't handle it quite right.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.400
Maybe actually maybe that's not the right way to put it.

04:17.400 --> 04:20.400
I think the right way to put it is we didn't have our eye on something.

04:20.400 --> 04:25.400
Yeah, Chris, you mentioned that you wanted to make good on how we touched on it last time.

04:25.400 --> 04:37.400
Yeah, this is awkward because we looked at the upcoming back then this was weeks ago, we looked at the upcoming Ubuntu release and we thought 2110 looks pretty standard on the main version.

04:37.400 --> 04:40.400
And we just thought, OK, it's not a big release.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.400
It's got a few notable things, but it's not this standard version isn't blowing us away.

04:44.400 --> 04:50.400
And as you might recall, we therefore decided that maybe we'd give the flavors a shot for this release.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.400
Chris was over on Monte and I chose Kubuntu.

04:53.400 --> 04:57.400
Yeah, and that was nice. You know, I think we liked both of them quite a bit.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.400
Good versions of the desktop environments for both of them as well.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.400
I think you and I both liked that quite a bit.

05:03.400 --> 05:09.400
But frankly, we we didn't really pay much attention to the main release.

05:09.400 --> 05:15.400
I had spun it up briefly, tried it, didn't really pay much attention other than just to check out the genome experience.

05:15.400 --> 05:23.400
And then after the show, I had an opportunity to use it a little more, just not really even in a review mode, just using the main version of Ubuntu.

05:23.400 --> 05:28.400
And I realized we missed an opportunity, but like kind of in a bad way.

05:28.400 --> 05:34.400
And this isn't an Ubuntu bashing session because I love Ubuntu and I'm very grateful for the work Canonical does there.

05:34.400 --> 05:40.400
But it is out of all of the versions of Ubuntu that I've ever reviewed, which is literally all of them.

05:40.400 --> 05:48.400
It's not even like a it's not even like a humble break. It's just a fact of I've reviewed literally every release of Ubuntu ever in some podcasts at some point.

05:48.400 --> 05:57.400
And so I've spent time with each one of them comparing and contrasting them to the previous versions and 2110 disappoints.

05:57.400 --> 06:02.400
And I'm worried about a general fade here that we're seeing. And this isn't a bash session.

06:02.400 --> 06:06.400
This is like as a community, let's align our expectations.

06:06.400 --> 06:12.400
And I want to I want to chat this with you guys, just sort of hash this out here in a moment. But let me tell you what I'm seeing.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.400
I'd like to know if people in the room are seeing some of this stuff, too. So take me in a bit.

06:16.400 --> 06:22.400
But to start with what I've seen, the main version of Ubuntu is just on the surface.

06:22.400 --> 06:29.400
It feels a little underwhelming. The GNOME 40 integration, which we waited for, still feels a bit unfinished, to be honest with you.

06:29.400 --> 06:41.400
Beyond the dock, which they've added back in there and the Uru theme, there doesn't really seem to be much integration that's happened that really kind of warranted punting the release like this of GNOME.

06:41.400 --> 06:46.400
And the Uru theme is actually created by a community outside of canonical.

06:46.400 --> 06:52.400
So that isn't I mean, I'm sure there's some work inside canonical to coordinate that. And that's awesome. Thank you for doing that.

06:52.400 --> 06:59.400
But it seems like even like the biggest piece for GNOME 40, which was the theme, wasn't really done by canonical staff.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.400
And it just seems like a real minimum effort kind of thing, Wes.

07:02.400 --> 07:09.400
Yeah, you're just kind of wondering how much work was really spent here. And what does that say about where canonical's focus is?

07:09.400 --> 07:13.400
Yeah, it's like maybe not enough staff kind of a thing.

07:13.400 --> 07:24.400
It was rough, too, because I didn't really appreciate the difference between the DEB and the SNAP of Firefox in the flavors because the flavors chose to, like in the case of Kubuntu, just ship the DEB.

07:24.400 --> 07:32.400
But using it for a bit, I was actually pretty disappointed in the implementation. And this isn't a SNAP bash either, because I think universal software is great.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.400
And I think you were pretty hopeful, right?

07:34.400 --> 07:43.400
I mean, we kind of touched on how both canonical and Mozilla had put some work in here to try to make Firefox as a SNAP a good experience. But that's why it's important to touch on it.

07:43.400 --> 07:47.400
We did cover that aspect of it. But the actual usage of it was disappointing.

07:47.400 --> 07:55.400
The launch time is slower. Even on relatively high performance systems, it takes longer to launch than you'd think.

07:55.400 --> 07:58.400
And the stability was less than ideal.

07:58.400 --> 08:05.400
So we've also had emails in that have told us that certain hardware products they use for their company login systems don't work with the SNAP.

08:05.400 --> 08:19.400
That's kind of unfortunate. But for me, before Starlink, I was on LTE and I'm downloading an ISO image and I'm sitting there for 45 minutes and I'm watching this slowly trickle over my cellular connection as the providers will allow me to have it.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.400
And just desperate for it to finish because I've got to go. I don't have a lot more time.

08:23.400 --> 08:27.400
Five minutes left on this download. I'm doing nothing in Firefox.

08:27.400 --> 08:32.400
It's sitting on the new tab page and I have the download menu open so I can watch the progress of the download.

08:32.400 --> 08:36.400
And I haven't touched the machine. I'm even not even I'm chatting on a different computer.

08:36.400 --> 08:42.400
I'm just watching the Firefox download like you should never do, you know, watching a pot try to boil kind of thing.

08:42.400 --> 08:49.400
Five minutes left. No one's touching the machine and Firefox just insta crashes.

08:49.400 --> 08:57.400
Just boom, gone. And of course, I could resume the download, but it went back like 40 percent.

08:57.400 --> 09:02.400
So it added like another 25 minutes to the download. And I couldn't I couldn't make any sense of it.

09:02.400 --> 09:07.400
And that's just the worst experience. And the thing that really got me upset.

09:07.400 --> 09:14.400
Was I realized, holy shit, this would have been just that could have just accomplished the same exact goal.

09:14.400 --> 09:19.400
If they just use the flat pack and that wouldn't have been a worse user experience.

09:19.400 --> 09:23.400
And that's really frustrating because I do appreciate what they're trying to accomplish.

09:23.400 --> 09:27.400
And I don't know if the flat pack has the same collaboration that the snap does.

09:27.400 --> 09:37.400
It may very well may not. I don't know. But I do know it would have been a better user experience for me because I've had experience with that and it launches right away and it doesn't crash on me.

09:37.400 --> 09:45.400
And just that realization that they chose to do this snap effort and they've created a worse experience for me now.

09:45.400 --> 09:51.400
When the flat pack could have worked, even though it's not their tech, I appreciate that, but it could have worked and it would have been a better experience.

09:51.400 --> 09:58.400
And it's those kinds of little compromises that I think have become pervasive throughout the Ubuntu experience.

09:58.400 --> 10:06.400
Gnome 40 instead of 41. And what we got was an updated theme and a doc. And it's not it's not really feeling all of that complete.

10:06.400 --> 10:22.400
But beyond just my experience, when I look out into the Internet to see what others is, other than the trashing it's getting on YouTube, the real ones seem to be there was a major data loss bug in the upgrade process for users of ZFS.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.400
Surprise, surprise. Hey, that's me.

10:25.400 --> 10:39.400
Some people when they upgraded to 2110 had their ZFS file system irreparably corrupted. It was noted in the release notes, but only after two thousand eight hundred and eight words.

10:39.400 --> 10:45.400
And then the internal response, perhaps even more damning, was rather messy.

10:45.400 --> 10:53.400
When you look at the history of the bug, it seems initially, from what I can tell, it got assigned to a staffer who didn't even work at Canonical.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.400
And then it got moved around and it did eventually get fixed.

10:56.400 --> 11:02.400
But this is a frickin data loss bug. And it just seemed like nobody was behind the wheel over there.

11:02.400 --> 11:09.400
I'm hurting over this because Ubuntu was our was a shining beacon on the hill of desktop usability.

11:09.400 --> 11:20.400
And what 2110 represents is is it's boring at best and disappointing at worst.

11:20.400 --> 11:31.400
And I'm not sure what that signifies, but I have a sense it means we need to realign our expectations of what we are getting as a desktop product out of Canonical.

11:31.400 --> 11:39.400
So here's my question to the class. And Brian, I'd like to start with you and I'd like to open up to the Mumble Room and then Weston, I'll close it up.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.400
But does Canonical need to be doing more?

11:41.400 --> 11:51.400
Is this sort of minimum viable desktop that is usable by OEMs that can be rebased with flavors that provides you a fairly consistent experience?

11:51.400 --> 11:57.400
Is that enough? Because maybe what's really Ubuntu's advantage now is vendor application support and community support.

11:57.400 --> 12:04.400
And Canonical doesn't necessarily need to be pushing the edge with PipeWire and GNOME 41 and dedicating more staff to this.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.400
Brent, what do you think? Is is it me that's the problem here?

12:07.400 --> 12:16.400
Well, I don't think Canonical is necessarily interested in being like the cutting edge of technology anymore for desktop users on a whole.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.400
They are doing some some cool things to, you know, try to push the envelope.

12:20.400 --> 12:34.400
But I wonder, you know, Hopi has come on here so many times in the past saying that the number of users of sort of the vanilla Ubuntu desktop is really impressive.

12:34.400 --> 12:42.400
I don't think he ever shared numbers, but I just remember sort of cementing that into my mind that, oh, yeah, it's way more than we probably think.

12:42.400 --> 12:55.400
So to see that desktop experience start to disappoint in many more ways than one and to do some experiments like the Firefox snap, but not to clearly not to have tested it enough.

12:55.400 --> 13:04.400
It feels, like you said, really unfortunate. And I have tons of respect for people on the Ubuntu desktop team. We know a lot of them.

13:04.400 --> 13:12.400
And I think they're going through a hard time and it shows. And I think that's really unfortunate, really.

13:12.400 --> 13:18.400
Minimac, this is the time right now with this release to work out these kind of kinks, I suppose.

13:18.400 --> 13:31.400
Yeah, I'm a long time Ubuntu user and the last version before the next LTS was always the version where they introduced the big system changes to be able to test them.

13:31.400 --> 13:38.400
So I was quite amazed that Pipewire didn't really make it into the default distribution. It is available.

13:38.400 --> 13:44.400
You can switch to it, but it's not enabled as default. And when it comes to GNOME, I don't know.

13:44.400 --> 13:53.400
There are a lot of changes coming to now, and I have the feeling that they haven't really decided what version of GNOME they will use in 2204.

13:53.400 --> 13:57.400
So a lot of thinking and work going on there, I think.

13:57.400 --> 14:03.400
So, Neil, I think part of this is there's two different users of Ubuntu. There's the LTS users, there's the interim users.

14:03.400 --> 14:08.400
But Minimac touches on a good point there. There isn't a lot that's being tried in this release.

14:08.400 --> 14:16.400
We're probably not going to get GNOME 41 or 42 in the LTS version. We might not get Pipewire by default. Wayland probably won't land by default.

14:16.400 --> 14:23.400
More and more things are kind of falling behind, and I worry that ultimately will make the LTS desktop less appealing. What do you think of that?

14:23.400 --> 14:29.400
Wayland by default actually happened in 2104. So props to them. They actually did finally start doing it.

14:29.400 --> 14:38.400
But the larger point I think we've kind of forgotten is that Ubuntu wasn't about LTS or fast-moving or any of those things.

14:38.400 --> 14:47.400
What Ubuntu started out as, and I think this release as it is kind of exemplifies it better than any other release in the past,

14:47.400 --> 14:54.400
is it is taking a snapshot of Debian SID and rebranding it and cutting it for a release.

14:54.400 --> 15:04.400
Now, I'm not trivializing that. Saying that as a simple statement, that doesn't make it a simple task. It is very difficult to do that kind of stuff.

15:04.400 --> 15:15.400
But that is essentially what the original goal of Ubuntu was, was to take Debian and throw some spit shine on it,

15:15.400 --> 15:24.400
replace some of the creaky pearl stuff with more useful user-intuitive Python tools and do a regular cadence of releases

15:24.400 --> 15:32.400
so people could see how the Debian distribution was evolving because Debian releases very slowly.

15:32.400 --> 15:41.400
This is the goal. And I think when you look at what's going on in Ubuntu 2110, it shows, right?

15:41.400 --> 15:50.400
It's taking what's in Debian SID, it is applying the Ubuntu Delta of branding and other customizations, and it is shipping that.

15:50.400 --> 15:58.400
The Firefox snap versus Flatpak, that's a different discussion for another time.

15:58.400 --> 16:09.400
But I think people are going to be increasingly disappointed in Ubuntu as it goes back and goes to its roots of being essentially that.

16:09.400 --> 16:20.400
And in the past, they deviated a lot more from that during the Unity days and the early days around investing in infrastructure stuff and things like that.

16:20.400 --> 16:34.400
At this point, it is just enough desktop built on top with some spit and shine and customizations to reflect the Ubuntu brand to ship and deliver.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.400
That's what it is.

16:35.400 --> 16:41.400
Wes, I like to look at a lot of these things through the lens of the enterprise market and the server market.

16:41.400 --> 16:50.400
And I wonder if maybe this isn't just a clever strategy that leaves enthusiasts like me kind of disappointed, but is actually a keen move on Canonical's part.

16:50.400 --> 17:00.400
They're building a product that still brings value to their server product because it's a platform developers can use to make sure applications work great on Ubuntu.

17:00.400 --> 17:11.400
Without 200 people working on staff to build this thing, is that maybe the appropriate way to look at this is how does it serve the server market or do you think broader than that?

17:11.400 --> 17:14.400
Well, I mean, you have to at least consider that, right?

17:14.400 --> 17:19.400
I mean, resources get allocated at the end of the day where it makes sense for the business.

17:19.400 --> 17:30.400
And it's just kind of strange to see a shift where I always felt that with the Ubuntu desktop, it might not be the shiniest, it might not have as new things as Fedora or what I could get in Arch and assemble myself.

17:30.400 --> 17:41.400
But I could get really close to something approaching the state of the art in the most user friendly or close to that that you could get in the Linux world.

17:41.400 --> 17:50.400
And having that slip. Yeah, it does. It does seem like it might echo where some of the leadership and the resources are being directed at Canonical.

17:50.400 --> 17:56.400
And I don't think they're slipping away on the server side of things. They've got to just be putting those resources over there.

17:56.400 --> 18:11.400
And can you really blame them if a lot of the technology stack now is at least sponsored in part by Red Hat? They're probably their largest competitor, right?

18:11.400 --> 18:16.400
The GNOME stack, the system D stack. I mean, they would argue, oh, we're not Red Hat projects, but they're influenced and they're sponsored.

18:16.400 --> 18:19.400
I mean, it seems that seems maybe semi-fair to say.

18:19.400 --> 18:29.400
And so at least I could see that perspective from Canonical and I could see kind of the idea of just sort of, all right, we'll just go with the flow.

18:29.400 --> 18:36.400
And I mean, they've been burned, right? I mean, there's that whole mobile saga. There's Mir, there's Unity.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.400
There's a lot of interesting things that they've tried and have advanced.

18:39.400 --> 18:47.400
And maybe there's a feeling of not quite getting enough out of all those efforts to really keep putting in that kind of above and beyond labor.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.400
Yeah, maybe I've got it all wrong. We'll see.

18:50.400 --> 18:55.400
You know, at the end of the day, it still makes a pretty damn good desktop, especially when you buy it with a piece of hardware.

18:55.400 --> 19:02.400
And what really struck me was just I guess I expected more from that Firefox snap experience.

19:02.400 --> 19:10.400
I was pretty shocked when not only not only was it having problems for me, but if you look at just about every review out there, there's complaints about it.

19:10.400 --> 19:17.400
But then we started getting emails from people that said, you know, I can't get logged in now to my company's web app when I work from home.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.400
I thought, well, that's why you don't upgrade your work machine.

19:20.400 --> 19:24.400
That's why you stick with the LTS on the work machine.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.400
But, you know, at the end of the day, it's pretty easy.

19:26.400 --> 19:33.400
It's still you can still get the deb of it, of course, or you can just go get the tar file from from Mozilla or, as you say, the flat back.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.400
Yeah, that works pretty good.

19:35.400 --> 19:44.400
So something else I use as a flat pack is element and you might recall element. They're the makers of the probably the most popular matrix chat app.

19:44.400 --> 19:49.400
And this next story almost seems like too good to be true for a guy like me.

19:49.400 --> 19:53.400
The team behind element today announced element one.

19:53.400 --> 20:03.400
They're pitching it as a complete messaging package that bridges WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram via their hosted service for just five dollars a month.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.400
Whoa. I mean, OK, you could make all this stuff work before, right?

20:07.400 --> 20:14.400
Obviously, you can host your own bridges or if you're an enterprise or someone paying for like, you know, managing a whole server and team accounts, that kind of thing.

20:14.400 --> 20:21.400
This was possible. But this is kind of a new offering just to users like you and me.

20:21.400 --> 20:26.400
Now, they say that there's unlimited usage with some, quote, fair usage limits.

20:26.400 --> 20:30.400
But for their part, hopefully these are, quote, generous.

20:30.400 --> 20:34.400
Yeah, it seems like maybe that is just a ban, like automated spamming and stuff.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.400
So if you trigger like some serious thresholds, then it's no longer unlimited.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.400
But they didn't really come out with any specifics there.

20:40.400 --> 20:47.400
You know, Chris, when you brought this to my attention, I thought it was kind of amazing and something I've been waiting for for a long time.

20:47.400 --> 20:57.400
I don't know if you feel this way, but having eight different chat applications feels a little daunting to me and how it brings together stuff that we already use is great,

20:57.400 --> 21:02.400
especially from a place that we seem to have been loving for the last little bit.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.400
So it feels like there's a lot of promise there.

21:05.400 --> 21:15.400
And for someone like me who doesn't want to, like, tinker to try to get all this stuff working, it's a nice, reasonable, at least for me, fee to put all the hard parts together for you.

21:15.400 --> 21:20.400
But I did see one caveat about the end to end encryption.

21:20.400 --> 21:28.400
It seems like for now, the chat services you bridge to has a broken end to end connection.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.400
So I know they're working on that.

21:30.400 --> 21:35.400
As we know, end to end encryption is not the easiest thing, especially with various services.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.400
So I'm interested to see where that'll come.

21:38.400 --> 21:46.400
They do write that the bridges operate in elements trusted EMS environment with no content scanning or data mining.

21:46.400 --> 21:51.400
But currently, bridged conversations are not stored and encrypted in matrix.

21:51.400 --> 21:54.400
So that's something to consider and to watch out for in the future.

21:54.400 --> 21:58.400
I appreciate them making that disclosure up front.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.400
And that is a pretty big limiting factor for a lot of people, I would imagine.

22:02.400 --> 22:08.400
I'm not a signal user, but if I used signal, I would imagine I'd be doing so specifically for the security aspects of it.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.400
That would concern me.

22:09.400 --> 22:16.400
I am a heavy telegram user, and I have never used telegram for its encryption or privacy.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.400
Now, it's just a great chat client.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.400
That's the thing that's appealing, right?

22:19.400 --> 22:20.400
Yeah, totally.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.400
I mean, I expect the encryption to be compromised or will be compromised one day.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.400
I'd love it not to be.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.400
I expect friends to keep our conversations private.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.400
But I don't I do not rely on the encryption.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.400
There's also another aspect here.

22:32.400 --> 22:42.400
It's interesting to see how EMS and Element and the folks behind Element and Matrix are trying to find paths towards sustainability.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.400
And maybe this kind of level is enough, right?

22:45.400 --> 22:49.400
That $5 a month might be enough to actually entice people to do it.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.400
Is that too much?

22:50.400 --> 22:51.400
It's close.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.400
It's pretty close.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.400
I think it's like the right price for a user.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.400
I think that's why they priced it there.

22:56.400 --> 22:59.400
It is the right price for something I'd be willing to try.

22:59.400 --> 23:03.400
However, you and I have hands-on experience running a Matrix server.

23:03.400 --> 23:10.400
And I don't think if we charge the listeners, if we charge each user of the Matrix server $5 a month,

23:10.400 --> 23:13.400
I don't think it would cover the run cost of the Matrix server.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.400
And we have a smaller Matrix server than they do.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.400
You know, that may be true.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.400
I've got to hope they're better admins than we are, though.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.400
lino.com slash unplugged.

23:25.400 --> 23:30.400
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account and you go there to support this here show.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.400
Linode's where you can host everything.

23:32.400 --> 23:37.400
They're 30% to 50% less than the major hypervisors out there that are just going to try to lock you into their platforms.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.400
And they've been around for 18 years before AWS even started.

23:40.400 --> 23:44.400
So they're really, really dialed in on how to do this.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.400
That's why I run all kinds of stuff up on Linode.

23:46.400 --> 23:51.400
Every single show we do is powered by a show doc.

23:51.400 --> 23:56.400
Everything we're going to talk about, the links we collect, if somebody contributes a new link suggestion during the show,

23:56.400 --> 23:58.400
we collect it all in our show doc.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.400
It's like the master doc for our show.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.400
And every single one of those is composed on a Linode.

24:04.400 --> 24:10.400
We use HedgeDoc hosted up on Linode to get collaborative real-time Markdown editing.

24:10.400 --> 24:14.400
It's like Google Docs, but for Markdown and modern and clean looking.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.400
And you can host it yourself.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.400
And we love running this kind of stuff on Linode.

24:18.400 --> 24:21.400
These tools that make producing these shows possible.

24:21.400 --> 24:26.400
And you could do for your projects, for your business, or maybe you just want a place to put a blog online.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.400
It all is so straightforward with Linode.

24:28.400 --> 24:32.400
And with that $100, that's them saying, we really want you to try this.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.400
It's not just like a fly-by-night thing.

24:34.400 --> 24:38.400
Like $100 is really something you can use to try out the service.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.400
That's confidence on Linode's part.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.400
And their mission remains unchanged since the day they began.

24:43.400 --> 24:47.400
Make cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible to all.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.400
That's it.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.400
It's easy to understand.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.400
It's straightforward.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.400
And I think it jives a lot with the mission of Linux.

24:53.400 --> 24:58.400
They also are really good about staying in tune with what the community likes because they're part of the community.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.400
Right?

24:59.400 --> 25:01.400
They got into this stuff because they're passionate.

25:01.400 --> 25:04.400
That's why they started Linode is because they saw where Linux was going.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.400
They played with the technology.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.400
I can really click with that.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.400
I totally understand following your passion and starting a business around that.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.400
And I think it's been their secret sauce.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.400
You see it in the documentation.

25:15.400 --> 25:23.400
The things that they write up like how to install custom Linux distros or host Plex using object storage for essentially unlimited Plex storage.

25:23.400 --> 25:26.400
All these kinds of things that they don't have to do.

25:26.400 --> 25:30.400
But they focus on that stuff because they want to include everybody.

25:30.400 --> 25:33.400
Not just the people like me that are trying to run their business infrastructure.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.400
But anyone.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.400
And the pricing reflects that too.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.400
And then the additional services on top of that.

25:38.400 --> 25:43.400
Like cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, VLAN support, and S3 compatible object storage.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.400
And a lot more.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.400
But really, just go try it for yourself.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.400
Go use that $100.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.400
Go see what you can do.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.400
Go kick the tires as they used to say.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.400
Just go to linode.com slash unplug.

25:55.400 --> 25:56.400
Go there to support the show.

25:56.400 --> 26:00.400
It's like saying, hey, thank you Linode for supporting my favorite Linux podcast.

26:00.400 --> 26:04.400
And you get $100 if you sign up with a new account for 60 days.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.400
Try out their super fast networking.

26:06.400 --> 26:10.400
Maybe even play around with some of the more advanced features like their Kubernetes or Terraform support.

26:10.400 --> 26:16.400
Or just set yourself up a box to do like an SSH jump host like I've done.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.400
This is something too I recommend.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.400
Give yourself like a support system in the cloud.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.400
It's got your tools.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.400
Maybe you have some jump hosts set up to there.

26:24.400 --> 26:27.400
Something that if you get to that box, you can support your friends and family.

26:27.400 --> 26:29.400
Or maybe your work machine or whatever it is.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.400
Oh man, it makes life great.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.400
Go try it out.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.400
Linode.com slash unplugged.

26:34.400 --> 26:37.400
This is actually the perfect time other than the storm.

26:37.400 --> 26:40.400
But the storm has been going on for days to record this.

26:40.400 --> 26:48.400
Because if we would have recorded this on the first day I set up Starlink, I'd be just gushing.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.400
Right?

26:49.400 --> 26:50.400
I'd be elated.

26:50.400 --> 26:54.400
I would be just going on about how amazing it is.

26:54.400 --> 26:58.400
And to their credit, Starlink couldn't be easier to set up.

26:58.400 --> 27:01.400
Everything you need comes in the box already wired together.

27:01.400 --> 27:04.400
So you don't have to figure out even where the ethernet cables plug in.

27:04.400 --> 27:05.400
It's already all plugged in.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.400
And they have color coded things.

27:07.400 --> 27:10.400
So the dish cable is gray.

27:10.400 --> 27:13.400
That goes into the gray end of the POE injector.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.400
The LAN side is white.

27:15.400 --> 27:16.400
So the plugs are white.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.400
The cables are white.

27:17.400 --> 27:20.400
Everything's color matched in that regard to make it super straightforward.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.400
So I set up their router.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.400
And I set up their dish.

27:25.400 --> 27:28.400
And for about 15 minutes it sort of sorted itself out.

27:28.400 --> 27:31.400
And I was getting like 40 megabits.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.400
I'm like, oh, you know, 40 megabits.

27:33.400 --> 27:37.400
Then once it sort of had settled, I did another speed test.

27:37.400 --> 27:41.400
And I got 240 megabits on that test.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.400
Whoa.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.400
Remarkable.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.400
Yeah.

27:44.400 --> 27:47.400
And you know, you have to get a good clear shot of the sky.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.400
But their app makes this really easy to do.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.400
You fire up the app and you say, I want to check this area.

27:53.400 --> 27:56.400
And they have like an augmented reality app.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.400
And they have like an augmented reality checker

27:59.400 --> 28:04.400
that gives you a really clear indicator of where you still need to scan.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.400
Then it maps out the whole area.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.400
And then it's got some data models on the app.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.400
And if it's your first time ever running it,

28:11.400 --> 28:13.400
it actually takes a little bit to generate it.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.400
But once you've run it once, it generates much faster.

28:15.400 --> 28:19.400
And it analyzes the image you just captured

28:19.400 --> 28:23.400
and tells you if the Starlink dish will have any trouble connecting to the sky.

28:23.400 --> 28:24.400
Oh, that's great.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.400
Yeah.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.400
So you imagine like you're trying to set up in a new area

28:27.400 --> 28:29.400
and you've got no idea if this is going to work or not.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.400
It's so awesome.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.400
That app, they nailed that.

28:33.400 --> 28:37.400
And I noticed that their router that they ship,

28:37.400 --> 28:40.400
which is a nice slick looking custom unit.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.400
And I later found out, we'll get into this more,

28:43.400 --> 28:46.400
but it uses a custom version of OpenWRT.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.400
So it's a little Linux box.

28:47.400 --> 28:48.400
Oh.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.400
But this is a good point, right?

28:49.400 --> 28:54.400
Like this is ISP, but of course, you know, us Linux nerds here,

28:54.400 --> 28:55.400
we don't know the pieces.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.400
Is there bridge mode?

28:56.400 --> 29:00.400
How does it actually work to get you an IP and talking to Starlink?

29:00.400 --> 29:01.400
Oh, gosh, it's interesting.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.400
And it's so cool.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.400
So they have an AUX port.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.400
Obviously, it comes with Wi-Fi and it's a little AP.

29:07.400 --> 29:11.400
But they got an AUX port on this thing that you can plug your router into

29:11.400 --> 29:13.400
and get an Ethernet connection.

29:13.400 --> 29:17.400
But it turns out, and I really hope they never change this,

29:17.400 --> 29:18.400
it goes a step further.

29:18.400 --> 29:23.400
Impressively, the little dishy McDish face that connects up to space

29:23.400 --> 29:29.400
actually has a very powerful custom SpaceX silicon Linux box in there.

29:29.400 --> 29:33.400
And everything you need to get connected to space is in the dish.

29:33.400 --> 29:37.400
If you have a solid LAN setup like probably a lot of our listeners do

29:37.400 --> 29:39.400
with a router you already like

29:39.400 --> 29:42.400
and Wi-Fi access points that you already want to use,

29:42.400 --> 29:46.400
you can take the router out of the picture altogether.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.400
Oh, that's great.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.400
And so I have gone directly from the back of the dish

29:50.400 --> 29:52.400
into my Peplink router.

29:52.400 --> 29:55.400
And now I manage it like I do my three LTE connections.

29:55.400 --> 29:59.400
It's just one of the connections now in my setup.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.400
I am so grateful because that router is nice.

30:01.400 --> 30:05.400
And if you didn't have something, you know, you were setting up from scratch,

30:05.400 --> 30:08.400
that would probably be one of the best ISP routers you're going to ever get.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.400
It's powerful.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.400
It's got OpenWRT on there.

30:11.400 --> 30:15.400
And it's got a good little powerful access point chip in it.

30:15.400 --> 30:18.400
But for me, I have invested years in a LAN setup

30:18.400 --> 30:23.400
that is very custom tailored to my mobile needs.

30:23.400 --> 30:26.400
And so the ability to go directly from the back of the dish

30:26.400 --> 30:29.400
into the PoE injector and then into my router means

30:29.400 --> 30:33.400
that the work I've invested into this setup to allow me to be mobile

30:33.400 --> 30:35.400
and work from the road is not wasted.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.400
It's just applied to the Starlink now.

30:38.400 --> 30:41.400
And I really am very happy about that.

30:41.400 --> 30:47.400
And I am extremely impressed by the capabilities of this little dish

30:47.400 --> 30:51.400
because it's passing through the DHCP information and everything like that.

30:51.400 --> 30:54.400
And it is using, I believe, the Linux system in there

30:54.400 --> 30:57.400
is using their patched version of U-Boot,

30:57.400 --> 30:59.400
which they put all of this stuff upstream.

30:59.400 --> 31:03.400
We'll have a link to their Space Exploration Technologies GitHub

31:03.400 --> 31:07.400
that has all of their patches for OpenWRT.

31:07.400 --> 31:10.400
It has their patches for their precision time protocol

31:10.400 --> 31:14.400
that they're using on the satellites, which is an open source time protocol.

31:14.400 --> 31:17.400
They're using that on the Linux boxes in space to keep time.

31:17.400 --> 31:20.400
They've done some patches. That's upstream on their GitHub.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.400
It's really great.

31:21.400 --> 31:26.400
The full stack from the router they ship you, the dish itself,

31:26.400 --> 31:29.400
the satellite it connects to, the ground stations,

31:29.400 --> 31:34.400
the ISP peer stations are all Linux from top to bottom.

31:34.400 --> 31:38.400
And, of course, the development systems at Starlink's office in SpaceX,

31:38.400 --> 31:40.400
also Linux.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.400
And get this, Wes.

31:41.400 --> 31:45.400
I got a few details about this, and you can suss out even more stuff

31:45.400 --> 31:47.400
in the AMAs I'll have linked in the show notes.

31:47.400 --> 31:53.400
But they deploy a full software stack refresh,

31:53.400 --> 31:56.400
a full, like the Linux OS and everything,

31:56.400 --> 31:58.400
to all of the satellites in orbit once a week.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.400
Oh, wow. That's impressive.

32:01.400 --> 32:03.400
Could you imagine?

32:03.400 --> 32:07.400
And they're using their own custom chips up on the satellites.

32:07.400 --> 32:11.400
They have a patched version of the Linux kernel, so it does preempt RT

32:11.400 --> 32:13.400
because everything needs to be real time up in space.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.400
Indeed.

32:15.400 --> 32:19.400
And so they're submitting their patches up for that, too.

32:19.400 --> 32:22.400
The connection itself is pretty good and solid.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.400
I'd say on average I'm seeing, with good clearance,

32:25.400 --> 32:28.400
about 140, 150 megabits.

32:28.400 --> 32:35.400
I get ping times between 20 milliseconds and 45, 50 milliseconds.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.400
I'm getting 54 right now.

32:37.400 --> 32:42.400
But for me, this enabled a new kind of off-grid working

32:42.400 --> 32:44.400
that I've been doing now for the last few days.

32:44.400 --> 32:48.400
Every show we've ever done on the road, remote,

32:48.400 --> 32:51.400
if we've been at System76 with an Ethernet connection

32:51.400 --> 32:54.400
or if I've been in some hellhole in Tucson,

32:54.400 --> 33:00.400
every show we did remotely was mixed through our studio.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.400
I'd come in with an Opus Audio feed, Wes comes in with an Opus feed,

33:03.400 --> 33:07.400
the Mumble Room comes in, we mix it all together in the studio,

33:07.400 --> 33:11.400
it sends it out to the OBS machine where we can record the members-only version

33:11.400 --> 33:14.400
of the show, and we can live stream it out to the internet.

33:14.400 --> 33:18.400
And the real compromise we were making there was all I really had was

33:18.400 --> 33:24.400
a low bit rate audio stream back to the studio because I had to compensate for LTE.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.400
And if I needed to control something or check in on the Mumble Room,

33:27.400 --> 33:32.400
I'd have to use something like Rust Desk to remote view the desktop in the studio,

33:32.400 --> 33:35.400
which of course didn't take bandwidth away from my VoIP session,

33:35.400 --> 33:39.400
lowering the quality and making me drop packets, and it was a mess.

33:39.400 --> 33:44.400
And Rust Desk is great, don't get us wrong, but boy, it's hard to do that live

33:44.400 --> 33:49.400
in a show remotely on LTE and a big old desktop screen.

33:49.400 --> 33:53.400
Right, and there's only so much you can expect with LTE,

33:53.400 --> 33:57.400
and I have a pretty optimal setup with three different LTE connections

33:57.400 --> 34:03.400
that I have bonded over a VPN that goes to three different servers at Linode

34:03.400 --> 34:07.400
running a custom VPN OS that combines it back together.

34:07.400 --> 34:10.400
I am doing best case scenario LTE compensation,

34:10.400 --> 34:13.400
and it's still limited in what it can achieve.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.400
But with the bandwidth availability of Starlink,

34:16.400 --> 34:20.400
I've done Coderadio and now Linux Unplugged completely live.

34:20.400 --> 34:26.400
Brent and Wes are coming in to my RV that's parked out here off-grid in the woods.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.400
The mumble room's coming in here. I'm mixing everything live.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.400
The live stream is streaming out over OBS.

34:32.400 --> 34:36.400
The member recording is happening here in the RV for the first time ever,

34:36.400 --> 34:38.400
and you guys know I've done a ton of remote shows.

34:38.400 --> 34:42.400
For the first time ever, I'm actually producing the full show remotely.

34:42.400 --> 34:45.400
The studio could be powered off right now.

34:45.400 --> 34:51.400
This is a remarkable difference in what is capable by going from a high-end,

34:51.400 --> 34:55.400
I'm talking very high-end, LTE setup to Starlink.

34:55.400 --> 35:01.400
And Starlink right now is $99 a month after you get the $400-and-something gear.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.400
It's pretty impressive, the change that this makes.

35:04.400 --> 35:10.400
It's sort of a – for remote workers, it's a paradigm shift in performance.

35:10.400 --> 35:15.400
And you combine that with an impressive power draw.

35:15.400 --> 35:19.400
When you look at all of the reviews online right now, they're all a little old,

35:19.400 --> 35:23.400
and they talk about how the dish is pulling around 100 watts of power.

35:23.400 --> 35:26.400
For me, that would be a huge deal.

35:26.400 --> 35:29.400
I would need to find a supplemental source of power,

35:29.400 --> 35:33.400
or I would need to increase the overall power capacity,

35:33.400 --> 35:35.400
battery capacity of lady tubes.

35:35.400 --> 35:40.400
100 watts consistently, 24-7, is a huge deal.

35:40.400 --> 35:45.400
I mean, right now as I'm recording the show, I actually have this up.

35:45.400 --> 35:49.400
My overall power draw for the entire live broadcast setup

35:49.400 --> 35:53.400
with everything pretty much turned off in the RV except for my Raspberry Pis

35:53.400 --> 35:56.400
is around 215 watts.

35:56.400 --> 35:59.400
I can probably make it like this for quite a while,

35:59.400 --> 36:05.400
but if I added another 100 watts to that, it'd really be a problem.

36:05.400 --> 36:10.400
It's no joke, especially during this storm where there's really no solar to be had.

36:10.400 --> 36:15.400
But I am impressed because through a series of what I think are probably

36:15.400 --> 36:18.400
software improvements, maybe some hardware revisions,

36:18.400 --> 36:22.400
they've gotten the power draw down from 100, 110 watts

36:22.400 --> 36:25.400
to around an average of 35 watts.

36:25.400 --> 36:29.400
Especially when you take out the router, you actually drop another 8 watts,

36:29.400 --> 36:32.400
so it's using less power than that, really.

36:32.400 --> 36:38.400
I've seen it peak as high as 75, but this is only for a short period of time,

36:38.400 --> 36:41.400
and on average, it's around 35 watts.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.400
What I did is I grabbed a smart plug that does power monitoring

36:45.400 --> 36:48.400
that feeds statistics into my Home Assistant instance,

36:48.400 --> 36:53.400
so I've been monitoring the power draw of the dish from the moment I powered it up.

36:53.400 --> 36:56.400
I've got historical data now over the last four days

36:56.400 --> 37:02.400
that shows me its overall power draw, and 75 watts is as high as it got.

37:02.400 --> 37:05.400
It really seems like the team just made some impressive improvements

37:05.400 --> 37:07.400
to the power use.

37:07.400 --> 37:12.400
An interesting note is cold weather will bring the power draw up of this dish

37:12.400 --> 37:14.400
so it can heat itself up to melt ice.

37:14.400 --> 37:18.400
A lot of the YouTube reviewers you'll see out there,

37:18.400 --> 37:21.400
they're going to tell you it's got heating elements in it,

37:21.400 --> 37:25.400
and that it turns these heating elements on to melt the ice.

37:25.400 --> 37:32.400
But in actuality, what it really is, is that the software just detunes the radios

37:32.400 --> 37:38.400
to run really inefficient, and their inefficiency generates heat.

37:38.400 --> 37:41.400
Yeah, right? The power's got to go somewhere.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.400
That's great, though.

37:43.400 --> 37:44.400
It's simpler, too.

37:44.400 --> 37:47.400
You don't have to ship these extra heating elements and extra parts.

37:47.400 --> 37:51.400
Yeah, it's a really clever little piece of hardware, that little dish.

37:51.400 --> 37:55.400
It self-actuates, and it moves to track the satellites and find them.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.400
It's really something to watch.

37:57.400 --> 38:02.400
And it seems that there are a series of projects going on right now

38:02.400 --> 38:04.400
to pull the statistics that the dish tracks,

38:04.400 --> 38:09.400
because the dish is tracking your speed, your latency, your packet loss,

38:09.400 --> 38:11.400
and that's all available in the app.

38:11.400 --> 38:14.400
If you bypass the router and you hook directly to the dish,

38:14.400 --> 38:16.400
the app doesn't work.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.400
Now, there's two solutions.

38:18.400 --> 38:22.400
I love that Starlink makes this available, because it lets you geek out.

38:22.400 --> 38:25.400
So if you want to bypass the router, but you still want to pull up the app

38:25.400 --> 38:28.400
and get the stats, you have to add a static route.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.400
I'll have the details in the show notes.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.400
And it's basically a route that you put on your router that says,

38:33.400 --> 38:39.400
when you go to this 192.168.100.1 machine, route it to this WAN interface.

38:39.400 --> 38:44.400
And then that will forward that to the WAN interface on the dish,

38:44.400 --> 38:47.400
which is set up to listen at 192.168.100.1,

38:47.400 --> 38:50.400
and it will retrieve the information for the app,

38:50.400 --> 38:52.400
and you can then use it with your own LAN.

38:52.400 --> 38:57.400
But the other route to go is there is a series of Python tools called

38:57.400 --> 39:01.400
Starlink GRPC tools, because they're using GRPC on the dish,

39:01.400 --> 39:05.400
and it can pull the stats remotely and store them locally.

39:05.400 --> 39:12.400
And our buddy Jeff Geerling has a Docker setup that will pull in the GRPC tools

39:12.400 --> 39:16.400
and Grafana, and then input that information directly into Grafana

39:16.400 --> 39:20.400
so you can have historical information of how the dish is performing

39:20.400 --> 39:22.400
right there on your Linux box.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.400
Oh, yes.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.400
It's nice to have these kinds of tools available,

39:26.400 --> 39:30.400
and it's so rad that Starlink didn't lock this stuff down,

39:30.400 --> 39:33.400
because it makes it so much more usable in my existing environment

39:33.400 --> 39:36.400
that I've spent a lot of time curating to work for me on the road.

39:36.400 --> 39:39.400
So I hope they never prevent this kind of flexibility.

39:39.400 --> 39:42.400
It enables a new kind of remote living.

39:42.400 --> 39:45.400
It's like good for my psyche to get out here in the woods.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.400
Like when I'm out here, I feel so much better.

39:47.400 --> 39:51.400
I'm not stressing about financial stuff or the state of world affairs.

39:51.400 --> 39:54.400
I'm like living in a little cabin out in the woods,

39:54.400 --> 39:57.400
and now I have internet that actually allows me to work out here.

39:57.400 --> 40:01.400
So in the past, I'd drive into the studio when I was out in the woods.

40:01.400 --> 40:06.400
I'd just jump in the car and take like a two-hour drive early in the morning,

40:06.400 --> 40:09.400
work out of the studio all day, and then drive back home for two hours

40:09.400 --> 40:11.400
to my RV out in the woods.

40:11.400 --> 40:14.400
And that's fine, but it's a silly use of gas,

40:14.400 --> 40:16.400
especially with the cost of fuel right now.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.400
Now I can just stay out here,

40:18.400 --> 40:23.400
and it actually improves my state of mind, my mood.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.400
It's such a special place that I was just telling Brent before the show,

40:26.400 --> 40:30.400
like I'm not sure if I want to bring you out here.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.400
You know what I mean?

40:31.400 --> 40:32.400
I want to show it to you,

40:32.400 --> 40:34.400
but I don't know if I actually want to take you here

40:34.400 --> 40:35.400
because it's so special to me.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.400
But you've got to show off Starlink in person.

40:37.400 --> 40:38.400
I want to see this thing.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.400
This might apply to my setup too.

40:40.400 --> 40:43.400
And something tells me Elon knows where it is now.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.400
Nice.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.400
Yeah, he's probably watching.

40:47.400 --> 40:50.400
You know, I had kind of an emotional moment.

40:50.400 --> 40:51.400
It was silly.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.400
Because the speed tests were like one thing.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.400
Okay, great.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.400
240 megabits.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.400
Wow.

40:56.400 --> 40:57.400
150 megabits.

40:57.400 --> 40:58.400
Wow.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.400
That's great.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.400
I want to see those speeds.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.400
But what actually hit me a lot harder than any speed test that I did

41:04.400 --> 41:07.400
was just seeing VS Code download

41:07.400 --> 41:10.400
and coming down to like 11 megabytes a second.

41:10.400 --> 41:14.400
I've never really experienced an internet connection like that at home before.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.400
And so, you know, when everything I do is online,

41:17.400 --> 41:21.400
and every app, every device, like everything's like using the internet,

41:21.400 --> 41:23.400
and the quality of your internet affects so much,

41:23.400 --> 41:25.400
just even how your devices perform

41:25.400 --> 41:29.400
because of their damn insistence on connectivity,

41:29.400 --> 41:32.400
it really felt like a shift for me.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.400
And I give it the full stamp.

41:34.400 --> 41:38.400
Even having the caveats of it's not fully out of beta yet,

41:38.400 --> 41:42.400
you know, some people experience sometimes like up to eight minutes of downtime a day.

41:42.400 --> 41:46.400
I think some of that might really be based on your sky clearance

41:46.400 --> 41:52.400
because having 100% clearance here, I've really had fantastic connectivity.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.400
I think over the last four days,

41:55.400 --> 42:00.400
I've maybe had a total of 35 seconds of downtime last time I checked the app.

42:00.400 --> 42:04.400
And my average ping, because of course I've been running a smoke ping

42:04.400 --> 42:06.400
to try it out here on my machine,

42:06.400 --> 42:11.400
is around 35 milliseconds back to Google and stuff like that.

42:11.400 --> 42:13.400
Today, it's actually kind of been the worst.

42:13.400 --> 42:16.400
So we're kind of trying this on the worst case scenario.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.400
And it's still holding up.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.400
Chris, I'm curious about how it's working.

42:20.400 --> 42:23.400
You said this in what you said was like four days of rainy weather.

42:23.400 --> 42:25.400
Do you think it's going to get better,

42:25.400 --> 42:28.400
or is it just not affected by sort of thick clouds and the such?

42:28.400 --> 42:30.400
Well, that'll be interesting to see.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.400
It seems rather unaffected by it.

42:32.400 --> 42:36.400
I think snow would be a bigger issue, especially a heavy snowstorm.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.400
And I was concerned it would get blown over.

42:39.400 --> 42:42.400
We were initially on the coast where I was first going to set it up,

42:42.400 --> 42:47.400
and the wind speeds were getting up to like 60 miles per hour out on the coast.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.400
So we came inland to our spot in the woods,

42:49.400 --> 42:51.400
just at the foot of the Cascades.

42:51.400 --> 42:56.400
So if it wasn't so gray, I'd be looking at the Cascade Mountains right now.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.400
And the wind wasn't as bad here,

42:58.400 --> 43:02.400
but we had this big channel of wind that came down right into

43:02.400 --> 43:05.400
where we're kind of in this groove around mountains.

43:05.400 --> 43:07.400
So it sort of channeled the wind in here,

43:07.400 --> 43:10.400
and it hit us real hard for like a half hour.

43:10.400 --> 43:14.400
And every tree around us had all of its leaves blown off.

43:14.400 --> 43:17.400
In fact, I think my solar panels are partially covered in leaves right now.

43:17.400 --> 43:21.400
And I sat there and watched the dishy to see if it would get blown over,

43:21.400 --> 43:26.400
because it's probably 25 miles per hour wind with a lot of things,

43:26.400 --> 43:28.400
debris flying through the wind or through the air.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.400
But it just stayed.

43:29.400 --> 43:31.400
It didn't even flinch.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.400
It just seems really sturdy.

43:33.400 --> 43:35.400
Because it looks kind of like it'd be a top-heavy thing,

43:35.400 --> 43:38.400
but they gave it a pretty sturdy base, so it seems to have held its ground.

43:38.400 --> 43:40.400
I mean, yeah, you storm tested it.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.400
It should be ready for anything, right?

43:42.400 --> 43:43.400
Yeah, I think.

43:43.400 --> 43:45.400
Maybe the snow, maybe the ice, we'll see.

43:45.400 --> 43:52.400
But I'm kind of just, I'm struck by when I started looking into what Starlink

43:52.400 --> 43:54.400
and what SpaceX is doing here,

43:54.400 --> 44:03.400
I realized this was way more complex and a way bigger deal

44:03.400 --> 44:06.400
than I think as a society we've really caught up to.

44:06.400 --> 44:09.400
SpaceX is about to switch over to using their Starship rocket,

44:09.400 --> 44:12.400
the big boy that they want to take to Mars,

44:12.400 --> 44:15.400
and that's going to increase their deployment capacity

44:15.400 --> 44:18.400
from something like 40 to 60 satellites at a time

44:18.400 --> 44:20.400
to something like 400 satellites at a time.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.400
Oh, wow, just in order of magnitude.

44:22.400 --> 44:26.400
Yeah, and the capacity, more capacity means faster speeds.

44:26.400 --> 44:27.400
It means more users.

44:27.400 --> 44:32.400
It's like they can add capacity by putting more of these things up in the sky

44:32.400 --> 44:35.400
in a way that like Comcast can't really.

44:35.400 --> 44:38.400
They can't just constantly be laying fiber all the time.

44:38.400 --> 44:40.400
And there is that element to this.

44:40.400 --> 44:42.400
Before I got it, I was given a lot of thought to,

44:42.400 --> 44:47.400
how do I feel about a lot more satellites up in space

44:47.400 --> 44:49.400
that you're going to be able to see from the ground?

44:49.400 --> 44:52.400
Is it going to be kind of feeling like we've junked up the sky?

44:52.400 --> 44:56.400
But the reality is, is that Starlink isn't the only initiative too.

44:56.400 --> 44:58.400
Like Bezos has an initiative to do this.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.400
Indeed.

44:59.400 --> 45:03.400
And SpaceX sees this as part of an interplanetary communications network.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.400
Like they see this as building infrastructure

45:05.400 --> 45:09.400
to enable communications to the moon and to Mars.

45:09.400 --> 45:14.400
But they also just recently acquired a company

45:14.400 --> 45:18.400
that was working on a system like Starlink, but for IoT devices.

45:18.400 --> 45:22.400
IoT devices that could be kind of smaller

45:22.400 --> 45:24.400
and didn't necessarily have big dishes,

45:24.400 --> 45:27.400
but could still receive these lower powered signals

45:27.400 --> 45:30.400
from smaller satellites up in space.

45:30.400 --> 45:33.400
And SpaceX just purchased that company.

45:33.400 --> 45:38.400
And so they may be also looking at launching into the IoT space down the road.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.400
They also just were granted a few months ago.

45:40.400 --> 45:41.400
I think it was back in July.

45:41.400 --> 45:44.400
They were requesting, I don't know if it's been granted yet,

45:44.400 --> 45:48.400
but they were requesting permission to test a mobile Starlink setup

45:48.400 --> 45:51.400
for buses, vans, boats, and airplanes.

45:51.400 --> 45:53.400
And just doesn't that make so much sense?

45:53.400 --> 45:56.400
Yeah, I mean, you could see how it would be a great service for airplanes.

45:56.400 --> 45:59.400
It's probably even a faster connection than I'm getting.

45:59.400 --> 46:02.400
You've been talking really great things about Starlink and your experience,

46:02.400 --> 46:05.400
but there's got to be some stuff that didn't go so well

46:05.400 --> 46:06.400
or some stuff you're worried about.

46:06.400 --> 46:10.400
So what's your least favorite thing about your Starlink experience to date?

46:10.400 --> 46:13.400
I think in part it's that it's the better than nothing beta.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.400
So things could go down.

46:14.400 --> 46:15.400
You don't really know.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.400
And so here I am.

46:16.400 --> 46:19.400
Now I'm kind of becoming dependent upon it.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.400
So there's that aspect of it.

46:21.400 --> 46:24.400
Also, I'm worried about moving this thing.

46:24.400 --> 46:26.400
Yeah, you and I have talked about theft as well.

46:26.400 --> 46:27.400
True.

46:27.400 --> 46:29.400
I could see at a campground somebody stealing it.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.400
That's why it would be nice to have it on the roof.

46:31.400 --> 46:33.400
But they expect you to use this in a service area.

46:33.400 --> 46:36.400
And you really shouldn't go beyond that service area.

46:36.400 --> 46:38.400
It's supposed to be fixed at your home.

46:38.400 --> 46:40.400
And moving it is tricky.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.400
And it requires updating your service address

46:42.400 --> 46:45.400
and hoping that there isn't overcapacity in that area.

46:45.400 --> 46:47.400
And perhaps they will allow you to move it.

46:47.400 --> 46:51.400
But that's not what this dish is licensed for by the FCC.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.400
And it's not how they've built the system.

46:53.400 --> 46:56.400
They've built the system such that you're at a service address

46:56.400 --> 46:59.400
and they use those service addresses to figure out

46:59.400 --> 47:01.400
where their biggest demand is at and stuff like that.

47:01.400 --> 47:03.400
So it goes into some of their planning, I would assume.

47:03.400 --> 47:06.400
But additionally, you could move it like I did

47:06.400 --> 47:08.400
to set it up here in the woods.

47:08.400 --> 47:10.400
And then say I want to go back somewhere

47:10.400 --> 47:12.400
that's more back in civilization.

47:12.400 --> 47:13.400
And I could try to move it back to there

47:13.400 --> 47:15.400
and it could tell me, nope, sorry.

47:15.400 --> 47:17.400
Overcapacity in this area.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.400
So there is that.

47:19.400 --> 47:22.400
Additionally, the power drive is a lot better than I expected.

47:22.400 --> 47:23.400
Absolutely.

47:23.400 --> 47:27.400
Between 35, 40 watts, 45 watts on average continuously.

47:27.400 --> 47:32.400
But that also has made a pretty big difference on our day-to-day here.

47:32.400 --> 47:34.400
Well, that and having zero solar.

47:34.400 --> 47:36.400
So it's really kind of a worst-case scenario.

47:36.400 --> 47:42.400
But my batteries, instead of being in the low 70s or high 60s

47:42.400 --> 47:44.400
in the morning now, they're in the 50s,

47:44.400 --> 47:48.400
the mid to high 50% range now when I wake up.

47:48.400 --> 47:50.400
Not the end of the world, but it's a lot of power draw.

47:50.400 --> 47:52.400
And that's a lot of other things that are running.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.400
That's not just the dish that brings that down.

47:54.400 --> 47:58.400
That's my fridge and my servers and my networking gear

47:58.400 --> 48:02.400
and a lot of little things are running, my CPAP and noisemakers.

48:02.400 --> 48:03.400
But it makes a difference.

48:03.400 --> 48:07.400
And it's about 5% to 10% of our battery draw.

48:07.400 --> 48:11.400
And that makes a difference when you're living for multiple days off grid.

48:11.400 --> 48:14.400
I'm now watching power a little more closely.

48:14.400 --> 48:16.400
It's like sort of a precious commodity right now.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.400
And so it's a downside.

48:18.400 --> 48:21.400
But because of the trade-offs, it's kind of worth it.

48:21.400 --> 48:24.400
And I'm not going to lie, Brent, as a space enthusiast

48:24.400 --> 48:26.400
who's also obviously a Linux enthusiast,

48:26.400 --> 48:30.400
this really brings two things I like a lot together.

48:30.400 --> 48:32.400
So I'll overlook some of that stuff.

48:32.400 --> 48:38.400
I'm curious if you've considered adding your automation enthusiast to the situation.

48:38.400 --> 48:42.400
Is it possible, first of all, without too much trouble to automate the dish?

48:42.400 --> 48:46.400
So that, for instance, you could turn it off past midnight or something

48:46.400 --> 48:49.400
to save power for eight hours or something?

48:49.400 --> 48:50.400
I may actually do that.

48:50.400 --> 48:52.400
So that was another reason I put it on a smart plug.

48:52.400 --> 48:57.400
So the dish itself draws power through PoE, power over Ethernet.

48:57.400 --> 49:02.400
They supply you with a very high-end custom PoE injector

49:02.400 --> 49:05.400
because this thing can draw a lot of power if it needs to heat itself.

49:05.400 --> 49:09.400
I mean, I think this thing allows for like up to 150, 160 watts or more than that.

49:09.400 --> 49:11.400
It's a lot of power for PoE.

49:11.400 --> 49:15.400
So you probably want to use their custom PoE injector.

49:15.400 --> 49:17.400
So that is what I plugged into a smart plug.

49:17.400 --> 49:20.400
So not only can I monitor the draw of the dish,

49:20.400 --> 49:23.400
but I can also turn it off from Home Assistant.

49:23.400 --> 49:27.400
And I may very well do that, is set some sort of automation.

49:27.400 --> 49:31.400
What would be incredible, what would be like next level and very doable

49:31.400 --> 49:35.400
because those gRPC tools I mentioned, they're all Python tools.

49:35.400 --> 49:37.400
Home Assistant's a Python project.

49:37.400 --> 49:43.400
It really is just so ripe for the picking to take the data that's on Dishy

49:43.400 --> 49:46.400
and make an integration that feeds it into Home Assistant.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.400
So then ideally you could do something like,

49:49.400 --> 49:54.400
when my average transfer rate drops below this threshold for X amount of time

49:54.400 --> 49:57.400
after 11 PM, switch off the smart plug.

49:57.400 --> 50:01.400
That sounds possible, but just all the bits aren't there yet to connect it.

50:01.400 --> 50:04.400
Somebody needs to make a Home Assistant integration for Starlink.

50:04.400 --> 50:06.400
That would be amazing.

50:06.400 --> 50:10.400
I'm curious too about the downtime from the moment, you know,

50:10.400 --> 50:14.400
you turn the power back on until you have a usable connection.

50:14.400 --> 50:17.400
It's quicker than I expected. I think it was 30 seconds or so.

50:17.400 --> 50:19.400
Gosh, that's actually really super reasonable.

50:19.400 --> 50:21.400
Yeah, I was impressed. I really was.

50:21.400 --> 50:23.400
I think I, you know, I stepped away for a second,

50:23.400 --> 50:27.400
grabbed something, came back to my desk and it was pretty much back up and going.

50:27.400 --> 50:29.400
I liked that a lot.

50:31.400 --> 50:33.400
Just a little housekeeping before we get out of here.

50:33.400 --> 50:35.400
Thank you to our members at unpluggedcord.com.

50:35.400 --> 50:38.400
Our member feeds have some of the best bits in them.

50:38.400 --> 50:41.400
You get the full recording, everything we messed up,

50:41.400 --> 50:44.400
plus a big pre and post show, which is like a whole other show.

50:44.400 --> 50:46.400
It's a way to say thank you to our members.

50:46.400 --> 50:50.400
And then if that's not your thing, you like it short and tight, nice and quick.

50:50.400 --> 50:53.400
We have that too. We have a second feed that is limited ads,

50:53.400 --> 50:55.400
but the same full production.

50:55.400 --> 50:59.400
And you can get access to that by going to unpluggedcord.com and support the show.

50:59.400 --> 51:03.400
If you have any feedback, topic ideas or thoughts on Fedora 35,

51:03.400 --> 51:08.400
which will be your covering next week, let us know at linuxunplugged.com slash contact

51:08.400 --> 51:12.400
and join our matrix community at linuxunplugged.com slash matrix.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.400
And the Luplug happens every Sunday.

51:14.400 --> 51:18.400
I popped in there for a bit this Sunday since we had delayed the land recording.

51:18.400 --> 51:21.400
I took the opportunity to say hi to the Luplug.

51:21.400 --> 51:24.400
It was a good time. That's noon Pacific in our mumble room.

51:24.400 --> 51:28.400
Mumble details at linuxunplugged.com slash mumble.

51:28.400 --> 51:30.400
How easy is that?

51:31.400 --> 51:34.400
Well, how about some feedback?

51:34.400 --> 51:37.400
James has a wormhole like app that he'd like to share.

51:37.400 --> 51:42.400
Hey guys, I want to throw out a cool file sharing app I've started using pretty heavily.

51:42.400 --> 51:47.400
It's in the vein of Magic Wormhole, but can be installed with a single binary.

51:47.400 --> 51:48.400
It's written in Go.

51:48.400 --> 51:50.400
Sorry, Chris.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.400
Can actually perform direct peer-to-peer connections as well

51:52.400 --> 51:56.400
and has the ability to resume interrupted transfers.

51:56.400 --> 51:58.400
There's even an Android app for it.

51:58.400 --> 52:00.400
It's called Croc.

52:00.400 --> 52:04.400
And actually, this is something we've talked about before, but it's been ages

52:04.400 --> 52:08.400
and this seems like a good chance to revisit it because I for one didn't know

52:08.400 --> 52:11.400
that there was Croc GUI, an Android app on F-Troid.

52:11.400 --> 52:13.400
I just might have to try that one out.

52:13.400 --> 52:15.400
Yeah, this looks pretty neat.

52:15.400 --> 52:21.400
And it looks like the GitHub page was bumped just about 20 days ago, 18 days ago.

52:21.400 --> 52:22.400
So it's still alive out there.

52:22.400 --> 52:28.400
You know, the idea of these kinds of things is you take a command, you point at a file

52:28.400 --> 52:32.400
and it makes that file immediately available for transmission over your LAN or the Internet.

52:32.400 --> 52:36.400
It's like the easy button for sending files around your LAN.

52:36.400 --> 52:38.400
Don't bother with secure copy.

52:38.400 --> 52:40.400
Don't bother with Samba.

52:40.400 --> 52:43.400
Use, in this case, Croc or what we've used at Wormhole before.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.400
I like that it does local peer-to-peer.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.400
I don't know if Wormhole does that.

52:47.400 --> 52:48.400
You know, we'll have to look.

52:48.400 --> 52:50.400
There may be some good comparisons out there of all of these tools.

52:50.400 --> 52:54.400
Hopefully, there's one of those awesome GitHub lists that kind of makes that clear.

52:54.400 --> 52:59.400
The one thing I will say is I think Magic Wormhole does still have, you know,

52:59.400 --> 53:01.400
kind of that social network effect.

53:01.400 --> 53:03.400
I was using Croc.

53:03.400 --> 53:06.400
I really love how easy they make it to host your own relay, which, you know,

53:06.400 --> 53:10.400
if you're exchanging private files, not that it has to travel over it,

53:10.400 --> 53:13.400
but just any of the setup of the exchange you might care about.

53:13.400 --> 53:16.400
And you can just type Croc relay and be up and going.

53:16.400 --> 53:19.400
But when you're actually transferring files with other people,

53:19.400 --> 53:22.400
it seems to me more people have Wormhole installed, at least right now.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.400
Fair enough.

53:24.400 --> 53:26.400
Hey, we have a pic before we get out of here.

53:26.400 --> 53:30.400
And I know Optimus Gray in our chat room is trying this one out right now.

53:30.400 --> 53:34.400
It's the official repository for KDE Connect on iOS.

53:34.400 --> 53:35.400
It is finally here.

53:35.400 --> 53:41.400
Yes, there is a companion app that works with iOS 15 that lets your iPhone

53:41.400 --> 53:43.400
get in on the KDE Connect fun.

53:43.400 --> 53:46.400
It's up on TestFlight right now, which is like the test area for apps

53:46.400 --> 53:48.400
sort of outside the App Store.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.400
And we'll have a link in the show notes.

53:50.400 --> 53:53.400
We call that poor man sideloading over here in Android world, Chris.

53:53.400 --> 53:56.400
It pretty much is exactly what it is, Wes.

53:56.400 --> 53:59.400
It's like sideloading with rails on rails.

53:59.400 --> 54:02.400
That's sideloading with bumpers.

54:02.400 --> 54:05.400
Oh, iPhone users, we put up with so much.

54:05.400 --> 54:08.400
But it's really nice to see KDE Connect for iOS now.

54:08.400 --> 54:10.400
It's been a long time coming.

54:10.400 --> 54:12.400
Yeah, KDE Connect is amazing.

54:12.400 --> 54:14.400
And I've kind of taken it for granted on Android.

54:14.400 --> 54:16.400
I didn't realize there wasn't anything on iOS.

54:16.400 --> 54:19.400
So here's hoping this makes it to the App Store sometime soon.

54:19.400 --> 54:23.400
Yeah, I wonder if this is the kind of thing Apple would allow in the App Store.

54:23.400 --> 54:24.400
That's a good question.

54:24.400 --> 54:27.400
Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?

54:27.400 --> 54:30.400
It'd really be nice if they acknowledge that kind of stuff.

54:30.400 --> 54:33.400
Oh, boy, I have lots of complaints and thoughts about that.

54:33.400 --> 54:35.400
But I'll save that for the Coder radio show at coder.show,

54:35.400 --> 54:37.400
if you haven't checked that out.

54:37.400 --> 54:40.400
Also, holla at our friends, a Cloud Guru on social media.

54:40.400 --> 54:43.400
They're just slash a Cloud Guru on social media platforms

54:43.400 --> 54:47.400
like YouTube or Twitter or the, I don't know, the Instagram.

54:47.400 --> 54:48.400
I mean, I don't know what you do.

54:48.400 --> 54:50.400
But if it's a social media, you can probably find them

54:50.400 --> 54:52.400
slash Cloud Guru, pow.

54:52.400 --> 54:54.400
If you do that Twitter thing, we're at Linux Unplugged

54:54.400 --> 54:56.400
and the network is at Jupiter Signal.

54:56.400 --> 55:01.400
If you're a big Mastodon user, I guess go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact

55:01.400 --> 55:02.400
and tell me why.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.400
Tell me.

55:03.400 --> 55:05.400
I've been thinking about it, but I don't know, man.

55:05.400 --> 55:07.400
I'd rather just go all in on Matrix.

55:07.400 --> 55:11.400
And you can find a whole network of podcasts over at Jupiterbroadcasting.com

55:11.400 --> 55:15.400
like the self-hosted show, like Linux Action News, like Coder Radio.

55:15.400 --> 55:18.400
You'll probably find more Wes Payne if you go look for it.

55:18.400 --> 55:20.400
I mean, there's probably lots of it over there, right?

55:20.400 --> 55:21.400
Just a bit.

55:21.400 --> 55:24.400
Why not go catch up on some old brunch classics over at extra.show?

55:24.400 --> 55:25.400
They're still up over there.

55:25.400 --> 55:27.400
Go listen to a little brunch.

55:27.400 --> 55:28.400
Spend your morning with Brent.

55:28.400 --> 55:29.400
That's what I do.

55:29.400 --> 55:31.400
When I'm missing him, I just play a brunch episode.

55:31.400 --> 55:32.400
Oh, that's so nice of you.

55:32.400 --> 55:35.400
If I play your episode with Wes, it's like I'm hanging out with the both of you.

55:35.400 --> 55:37.400
Ah, that's what you do when you hide in your secret spot.

55:37.400 --> 55:38.400
You won't invite us to.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.400
You know it's a Wes shrine.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.400
You just don't want to say it on air.

55:41.400 --> 55:42.400
You know it's true.

55:42.400 --> 55:48.400
Links to everything we talked about today at linuxunplugged.com slash 427?

55:48.400 --> 55:49.400
429.

55:49.400 --> 55:50.400
429.

55:50.400 --> 55:52.400
I don't think we're ready for 430.

55:52.400 --> 55:53.400
No.

55:53.400 --> 55:55.400
Although it will be our Fedora 35 review episode.

55:55.400 --> 56:01.400
We're going to do a Fedora 34 exit interview and we'll do a Fedora 35 review.

56:01.400 --> 56:05.400
So what I'd like to encourage is go try it out and let us know what you think during the show.

56:05.400 --> 56:06.400
So go get Fedora 35.

56:06.400 --> 56:07.400
It'll be out hopefully next week.

56:07.400 --> 56:08.400
Maybe not.

56:08.400 --> 56:10.400
Depends on the bugs.

56:10.400 --> 56:12.400
But you know, they release it when it's ready and we encourage that.

56:12.400 --> 56:16.400
So no razzing from us.

56:16.400 --> 56:17.400
Feel free to join us live.

56:17.400 --> 56:20.400
We do it rainstorms or not.

56:20.400 --> 56:22.400
Sorry if this episode sounded like hell.

56:22.400 --> 56:25.400
I'm sure Joe was trying his best.

56:25.400 --> 56:26.400
Probably swearing me.

56:26.400 --> 56:29.400
Just, I can picture it now.

56:29.400 --> 56:30.400
But no he tried.

56:30.400 --> 56:31.400
Just no he tried.

56:31.400 --> 56:32.400
There's nothing you can do.

56:32.400 --> 56:34.400
It's a bomb cyclone.

56:34.400 --> 56:37.400
But we do it live regardless.

56:37.400 --> 56:40.400
jblive.tv on a Tuesday at noon Pacific 3pm Eastern.

56:40.400 --> 56:44.400
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of Your Unplugged program.

56:44.400 --> 56:48.400
Even if you're not here live, we still appreciate the hell out of you.

56:48.400 --> 56:49.400
Thanks for subscribing.

56:49.400 --> 56:50.400
Thanks for downloading.

56:50.400 --> 56:51.400
Thanks for reviewing the show.

56:51.400 --> 56:52.400
All that kind of stuff.

56:52.400 --> 57:21.400
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

57:22.400 --> 57:34.400
Let's go find a title.

57:34.400 --> 57:35.400
JBtitles.com.

57:35.400 --> 57:36.400
I don't know.

57:36.400 --> 57:37.400
Maybe it'll sound all right.

57:37.400 --> 57:40.400
How did it, how did it sound in the land so far?

57:40.400 --> 57:41.400
Did it sound okay, Wes?

57:41.400 --> 57:42.400
Yeah.

57:42.400 --> 57:43.400
You know, it comes and goes.

57:43.400 --> 57:48.400
So there's definitely a few moments where it'll be clear, including the land intro where

57:48.400 --> 57:51.400
you're like, oh yeah, yeah, no, it's definitely raining behind Chris.

57:51.400 --> 57:52.400
Yeah.

57:52.400 --> 57:57.400
When you and I were doing land, it was raining hard and then no kidding.

57:57.400 --> 58:01.400
We'd stop like between a story or something to like check something and the rain would

58:01.400 --> 58:02.400
stop.

58:02.400 --> 58:06.400
And then right as we got started again, just pouring down rain.

58:06.400 --> 58:10.400
That's why I don't do this very often, but you know, I wanted to really, truly put Starlink

58:10.400 --> 58:14.400
through its paces and really see if this was legit or if it was hype.

58:14.400 --> 58:19.400
And, uh, I mean, here we are now, this is the second live show where I'm really pushing

58:19.400 --> 58:20.400
this thing.

58:20.400 --> 58:23.400
I'm taking remote audio streams to Wes and Brent to the mumble room.

58:23.400 --> 58:28.400
I've got a couple of computer, I've got, I've got like 60 devices on my land that are probably

58:28.400 --> 58:30.400
chirping to the internet all the time.

58:30.400 --> 58:32.400
I've got my web browser, my chat programs going.

58:32.400 --> 58:39.400
And of course we're live streaming over OBS and it is raining like the Dickens and it's

58:39.400 --> 58:40.400
really holding up right now.

58:40.400 --> 58:46.400
My ping time to Google is 35.2 milliseconds right now while I'm doing all of this, while

58:46.400 --> 58:50.400
the connection is theoretically fairly slammed.

58:50.400 --> 58:56.400
So I thought what I would do is pull up the real time power usage for the show and see

58:56.400 --> 58:59.400
how much power the dish used while we were doing the show.

58:59.400 --> 59:07.400
Because I, I have discovered through monitoring this thing that it uses more power to transmit

59:07.400 --> 59:09.400
than it does to receive.

59:09.400 --> 59:13.400
And if you think about it to receive, it's just sitting there listening for signals from

59:13.400 --> 59:14.400
space, right?

59:14.400 --> 59:19.400
But to send, it actually has to send that up into space.

59:19.400 --> 59:22.400
So it uses more power when you're transmitting more.

59:22.400 --> 59:23.400
Yeah, exactly.

59:23.400 --> 59:24.400
Uh, here we are right now.

59:24.400 --> 59:28.400
We're at 39 Watts, uh, in real time.

59:28.400 --> 59:34.400
And, uh, let's see around 9 am when I first started really cranking away for the day,

59:34.400 --> 59:41.400
56 Watts during the show around 47, 46, 46, 35 Watts right now.

59:41.400 --> 59:43.400
It's got down to 35 Watts while we're doing the show.

59:43.400 --> 59:46.400
Wow, that's amazing.

59:46.400 --> 01:00:13.400
Think about that for a Linux box that's communicating with space with freaking space.
