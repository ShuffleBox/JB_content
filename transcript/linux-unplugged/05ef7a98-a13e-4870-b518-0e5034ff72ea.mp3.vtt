WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.900
So Rekai has a story to share with the class

00:02.900 --> 00:04.540
that surprised me.

00:04.540 --> 00:07.900
That it impacted the release of User Error.

00:07.900 --> 00:12.200
And it's a significant trying times we live in, Wes,

00:12.200 --> 00:14.180
when a problem like this exists

00:14.180 --> 00:16.100
and no one steps up to solve it.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.340
One man must come to the people,

00:18.340 --> 00:22.340
must inform the people of the duty we must all take,

00:22.340 --> 00:24.420
the R-syncs that we must all pick up,

00:24.420 --> 00:25.820
and the scripts that must be written.

00:25.820 --> 00:27.260
What happened, Beard?

00:27.260 --> 00:30.460
I want to know why Ubuntu still sucks.

00:30.460 --> 00:31.500
Oh!

00:31.500 --> 00:32.340
Darn!

00:32.340 --> 00:33.180
Oh!

00:33.180 --> 00:34.020
Say it!

00:34.020 --> 00:36.580
Well, to be fair, to be fair, Debbie and Two,

00:39.500 --> 00:42.860
I want to know why in 2017,

00:42.860 --> 00:47.060
we do not have the ability to automatically check

00:47.060 --> 00:48.960
and see if our mirrors are up to date.

00:50.740 --> 00:54.920
Because I had to,

00:54.920 --> 00:56.600
I figured out this problem later.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.940
I had to install TeamViewer

00:58.940 --> 01:00.940
and TeamViewer would not installed

01:00.940 --> 01:02.540
because it was missing packages.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.580
There's your first mistake.

01:03.580 --> 01:04.540
That's your first problem.

01:04.540 --> 01:06.380
Oh, I had to be that guy.

01:06.380 --> 01:07.420
We all had to be that guy.

01:07.420 --> 01:11.100
Well, you know, give me another easy remote desktop solution

01:11.100 --> 01:12.500
that doesn't require forwarding ports.

01:12.500 --> 01:13.340
I will today.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.180
Oh.

01:14.180 --> 01:16.400
Well, that is what I will give you today,

01:16.400 --> 01:17.420
but except for that last part,

01:17.420 --> 01:19.900
you will have to forward port 22.

01:19.900 --> 01:22.780
But, so I couldn't install TeamViewer.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.620
It was telling me that packages were missing.

01:24.620 --> 01:28.420
I assumed it was just because packages had changed in 17.10.

01:28.420 --> 01:29.580
But no, it turns out,

01:29.580 --> 01:31.780
I found out completely unrelatedly later

01:31.780 --> 01:36.780
that the mirror that had been chosen for my Ubuntu install.

01:39.060 --> 01:40.260
So like when I installed,

01:40.260 --> 01:41.380
because that's the install I set up.

01:41.380 --> 01:42.220
Yeah.

01:42.220 --> 01:43.040
I didn't change the mirrors.

01:43.040 --> 01:43.880
I didn't change any of that stuff.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.760
Well, whatever it defaulted to had out of date packages

01:46.760 --> 01:50.560
because later I switched to a different mirror

01:50.560 --> 01:52.820
for an unrelated reason and it resolved everything.

01:52.820 --> 01:54.660
Everything was fine again.

01:55.900 --> 01:57.020
Now, do you think this is...

01:57.020 --> 01:59.500
Is this, do you need graphical access to the machine

01:59.500 --> 02:02.500
or are you remotely controlling a Windows machine

02:02.500 --> 02:05.300
or is this, is SSH enough without port forwarding?

02:05.300 --> 02:06.140
No, it doesn't.

02:06.140 --> 02:06.960
I need graphical access.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.800
Do you need the desktop?

02:07.800 --> 02:09.340
Which I have a solution for today's show,

02:09.340 --> 02:11.100
but except for his specific scenario,

02:11.100 --> 02:13.760
he needed the logged in sessions desktop.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.660
Yep.

02:14.660 --> 02:15.720
Right.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.300
Which is definitely a little trickier.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.140
TeamViewer's not bad.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.020
X11.

02:20.020 --> 02:21.860
We've talked about Splashtop before.

02:21.860 --> 02:23.780
If you, so today what we're gonna talk about

02:23.780 --> 02:25.820
is if you just want a remote desktop session

02:25.820 --> 02:27.780
that you can connect to and disconnect from

02:27.780 --> 02:30.260
and that session remains like running on the computer.

02:30.260 --> 02:31.100
Yeah.

02:31.100 --> 02:36.100
See, the thing about TeamViewer is I installed TeamViewer,

02:36.260 --> 02:38.020
I logged into my account,

02:38.020 --> 02:42.100
I clicked three boxes for unattended remote access

02:42.100 --> 02:45.060
and then I left and I was able to connect on the other end.

02:45.060 --> 02:46.620
So how, wait, so I gotta go back.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.600
How did you discover that it was out of date packages?

02:48.600 --> 02:49.540
Like I'm not clear on that.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.820
So you came to the conclusion that the repo

02:51.820 --> 02:53.780
hadn't like synced after 17.10 or something?

02:53.780 --> 02:56.020
Like they just didn't have the right version

02:56.020 --> 02:58.300
that supported Ubuntu 17.10?

02:58.300 --> 02:59.660
It was 17.10 packages

02:59.660 --> 03:01.500
because clearly it was getting packages from somewhere.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.340
Yeah, that's true.

03:02.340 --> 03:05.180
But some of the packages it was saying

03:05.180 --> 03:08.620
are referenced but don't exist on this mirror or whatever.

03:08.620 --> 03:09.780
And others. Oh, really?

03:09.780 --> 03:11.380
Yeah, others.

03:11.380 --> 03:13.980
And when I did a apt-get upgrade,

03:13.980 --> 03:15.280
it updated a couple of packages,

03:15.280 --> 03:17.880
but not as many as you would expect after a release.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.540
And then later I switched to a different mirror

03:20.540 --> 03:22.740
and I had a whole lot more updates

03:22.740 --> 03:26.740
and it solved the missing packages for TeamViewer

03:26.740 --> 03:29.620
because TeamViewer was like half installed.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.240
Because it was like, you know,

03:31.240 --> 03:33.460
it's installed but we're missing dependencies.

03:33.460 --> 03:35.540
See, this is, we have to rally the people

03:35.540 --> 03:37.140
because there's only one thing that can be done.

03:37.140 --> 03:41.020
So I'm just wondering why like in the process of,

03:41.020 --> 03:42.340
you know, checking for new packages,

03:42.340 --> 03:44.420
why aren't they checking the freshness of a mirror?

03:44.420 --> 03:45.420
This is your cause now.

03:45.420 --> 03:49.060
Mirror freshness is like your mission in life

03:49.060 --> 03:52.820
to make sure it stays fresh, I guess.

03:52.820 --> 03:53.980
Maybe it's just easier to blame Popeye.

03:53.980 --> 03:55.740
So I've just, yeah, sure.

03:55.740 --> 03:57.260
And I've just posted a link that tells you

03:57.260 --> 03:59.340
how up-to-date each of the mirrors are.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.340
Yeah, but what I'm asking is,

04:02.340 --> 04:04.980
why is this not part of the automatic process?

04:04.980 --> 04:06.980
I didn't realize this could be a thing, actually.

04:06.980 --> 04:07.940
To be honest with you, I didn't-

04:07.940 --> 04:09.300
It usually isn't.

04:09.300 --> 04:13.540
It typically isn't because there isn't a gigantic churn

04:13.540 --> 04:15.180
like there is at release time

04:15.180 --> 04:17.980
when hundreds of machines around the world

04:17.980 --> 04:19.780
are all hitting the same machine,

04:19.780 --> 04:21.580
trying to update at the same time.

04:21.580 --> 04:22.420
Okay, yeah, so I see here-

04:22.420 --> 04:24.460
I suspect you probably happen to hit

04:24.460 --> 04:26.700
the wrong time of the year for it, and that's all.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.880
Yeah, so it looks like there's one mirror

04:28.880 --> 04:31.140
that's a week behind, one that's two days behind.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.540
Most are all up to date, but yeah, this does,

04:33.540 --> 04:35.780
this is actually a pretty good thing to know.

04:35.780 --> 04:38.660
So that is launchpad.net slash Ubuntu

04:38.660 --> 04:42.600
slash plus archive mirrors, plus symbol archive mirrors.

04:43.780 --> 04:45.740
Cool, thanks, Popeye.

04:45.740 --> 04:48.460
I'll toss a link to that in the show notes.

04:48.460 --> 04:49.420
Sweet.

04:49.420 --> 04:50.940
I literally had no idea that was an issue

04:50.940 --> 04:52.640
because I just assumed these things

04:52.640 --> 04:54.140
slowly are synced to the background,

04:54.140 --> 04:55.360
but of course that's me being naive

04:55.360 --> 04:58.580
about the size of the data that they're moving around.

04:58.580 --> 05:00.820
They actually usually really quickly

05:00.820 --> 05:02.260
are synced in the background

05:02.260 --> 05:04.980
because they've all got stupidly fat connections

05:04.980 --> 05:06.340
to the internet.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.180
Yeah.

05:07.180 --> 05:08.000
Actually, I think I ran into that

05:08.000 --> 05:09.680
the other week as well, and then later it's like,

05:09.680 --> 05:11.700
oh yeah, everything's there now, all right, that's fine.

05:11.700 --> 05:15.340
You see, this is why I prefer boutique distributions

05:15.340 --> 05:17.340
because their small user base means

05:17.340 --> 05:19.580
that they can just download everything off a single mirror

05:19.580 --> 05:23.980
and I don't actually have anything, I'm just making that up.

05:23.980 --> 05:26.500
Actually, there's something to be said for simplicity

05:26.500 --> 05:29.580
is when you've got like a giant complex arrangement

05:29.580 --> 05:31.540
of moving parts, things can go wrong.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.380
Well, that's why-

05:32.380 --> 05:33.200
I mean, when no one uses your software,

05:33.200 --> 05:34.700
it's really easy to maintain.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.740
Or you take the Linux Mint approach

05:36.740 --> 05:39.560
and you just outsource that extremely complicated,

05:39.560 --> 05:42.500
massively expensive part of your infrastructure

05:42.500 --> 05:44.580
to somebody else, you know, that's like-

05:44.580 --> 05:46.980
Even look at like what Aiki just went through

05:46.980 --> 05:48.700
with his upsizing.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.380
You know, he pretty much got banged offline

05:50.380 --> 05:52.460
with his OVH server and then he had to go hunting

05:52.460 --> 05:55.020
for a CDN like as quick as he could.

05:55.020 --> 06:00.020
See, I guess what I'm asking is why don't they have,

06:01.200 --> 06:03.100
like when you do an app get update,

06:03.100 --> 06:07.940
it checks something like a mirror freshness list

06:07.940 --> 06:10.720
and says, hey, your mirror may be out of date,

06:10.720 --> 06:12.300
would you like to try another mirror?

06:12.300 --> 06:14.860
Yeah, like some sort of like-

06:14.860 --> 06:18.500
Because vast majority of the time it's never a problem

06:18.500 --> 06:20.300
and the mirrors are up to date and it's not an issue.

06:20.300 --> 06:23.060
Yeah, but when it is a problem, it's a huge problem.

06:23.060 --> 06:27.060
Like some sort of like apt update mirror or something

06:27.060 --> 06:28.660
that would also ping mirrors and stuff like-

06:28.660 --> 06:29.500
Well, there is.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.060
There's a software sources thing on the Ubuntu desktop

06:32.060 --> 06:33.940
where you press a button and it will choose

06:33.940 --> 06:35.780
the farthest best mirror nearest to you

06:35.780 --> 06:36.620
and all that kind of stuff.

06:36.620 --> 06:37.460
That's very fair.

06:37.460 --> 06:39.020
I just mean like sort of, just sort of like-

06:39.020 --> 06:40.500
Or you could just choose the central mirror

06:40.500 --> 06:43.620
and not use one local to you and choose the central one,

06:43.620 --> 06:44.580
which is always up to date.

06:44.580 --> 06:45.420
You could do that.

06:45.420 --> 06:46.240
Yeah.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.660
Yeah, it's one of the problems of having stuff

06:47.660 --> 06:49.220
distributed all over the place.

06:50.220 --> 06:53.340
This is Linux Unplugged episode 220

06:53.340 --> 06:55.800
for October 24th, 2017.

06:55.800 --> 07:00.800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

07:00.800 --> 07:04.480
that's Linux box is being held together with bubblegum,

07:04.480 --> 07:07.560
a little bit of duct tape and some hope.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.400
My name is Chris.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.220
My name is Wes.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.060
And Beard's here.

07:10.060 --> 07:10.900
Hello, Beard.

07:10.900 --> 07:12.880
Hey, I'm just over here taking out your sound server

07:12.880 --> 07:13.720
with systemd.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.480
Someone's gotta pre-chew all the gum.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.040
That's helpful too.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.480
That is very helpful.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.240
Yeah, I'm kind of like scraping a system together

07:21.240 --> 07:22.320
as we do this show.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.720
I'm just trying to figure out what's going on

07:23.720 --> 07:24.560
with the systemd.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.040
I'm just trying to figure out what's going on

07:26.040 --> 07:26.880
with the systemd.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.160
I'm just trying to figure out what's going on

07:28.160 --> 07:29.000
with the systemd.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.280
I'm scraping a system together as we do this show.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.480
Took us about 20 minutes to get the sound board working,

07:33.480 --> 07:34.320
but we've got that.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.560
So what else do we need other than a great lineup,

07:37.560 --> 07:38.380
which we have today.

07:38.380 --> 07:41.480
We have some news we'll get into, some community stuff,

07:41.480 --> 07:43.200
couple of follow-up stories.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.340
The Fedora Project has a post that they'd really like you

07:46.340 --> 07:48.840
to read and we'll give you some highlights from that.

07:48.840 --> 07:53.320
And then I've gone and created myself, not one,

07:53.320 --> 07:57.120
but two remote desktop solutions.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.460
I wanted to create myself a workstation in the cloud,

07:59.460 --> 08:02.480
completely independent and isolated from anything else

08:02.480 --> 08:05.480
that I could get access to anywhere in the world.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.900
And then I wanted to create a separate remote desktop system

08:08.900 --> 08:11.120
that was on the LAN of the studio.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.900
That could get access to our huge recording files

08:13.900 --> 08:18.900
that has a big fat GPU and a monster six core i7 CPU,

08:19.000 --> 08:20.780
lots of local storage.

08:20.780 --> 08:25.220
So one system up in the cloud with incredible bandwidth,

08:25.220 --> 08:28.640
unlimited storage that I could pay for if I want to attach

08:28.640 --> 08:32.320
and one system local with lots of GPU compute power,

08:32.320 --> 08:36.120
both of them running Linux using X2GO.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.520
And we've covered X2GO before on the network.

08:38.520 --> 08:42.240
Noah did a great how-to on it ages ago

08:42.240 --> 08:45.240
in Linux Action Show episode 374.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.320
And this is my take on it.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.680
I'm gonna talk about it a little bit differently.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.320
I'm using Ubuntu 17.10,

08:51.320 --> 08:53.240
so we'll talk about using modern Linux distributions

08:53.240 --> 08:58.040
to do this, how I'm doing it, what I'm using it for,

08:58.040 --> 08:59.280
what some of the downsides are,

08:59.280 --> 09:02.080
and how unbelievably easy it is to get set up

09:02.080 --> 09:04.240
and how it can just really change the game.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.840
And I'm using it even when I'm here on my LAN

09:06.840 --> 09:09.320
and I'm connecting to systems over the LAN using this.

09:09.320 --> 09:10.920
It's so, so great.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.680
So I'll share my project with you

09:12.680 --> 09:14.880
and give you a little demo of the entire thing too

09:14.880 --> 09:15.920
later on in the show.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.400
So stay tuned for all of that stuff.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.920
But before we go any further,

09:18.920 --> 09:21.040
we're gonna bring in our virtual log,

09:21.040 --> 09:24.140
Time Appropriate Greetings Discord channel.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.400
Hey, hey.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.220
Hey, hey.

09:27.220 --> 09:28.060
Hello.

09:28.060 --> 09:28.900
Hello, guys.

09:28.900 --> 09:29.760
Yeah, so episode 220.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.360
We're trying out Discord for this week's episode.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.000
And it's bumpy so far.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.760
You know, we're just, we're giving it a go, though.

09:35.760 --> 09:36.820
We're giving it a go.

09:36.820 --> 09:38.660
And we got a good amount of people showing up,

09:38.660 --> 09:40.480
so thank you, everybody, for helping us do that.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.480
Helps really actually put it through its paces.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.320
So let's start with some community news, Wes.

09:44.320 --> 09:45.260
What do you say, sir?

09:45.260 --> 09:46.340
What do you say? Please.

09:46.340 --> 09:48.080
I noticed, by the way, before we go any further,

09:48.080 --> 09:49.840
you're still running 17.10 on that monster.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.680
I sure am.

09:50.680 --> 09:51.600
You're stuck with it for the week, huh?

09:51.600 --> 09:52.440
Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.440
And Beard, your rig over there, still running 17.10.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.600
So all three of us are stuck with it for the week.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.880
How unusual.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.080
Against my better judgment.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.680
Yeah, yeah.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.640
All right, so let's talk about the Librem 5,

10:03.640 --> 10:05.400
which has been an ongoing story,

10:05.400 --> 10:07.840
spiked almost every single week by some new development.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.320
And it has come to a conclusion.

10:10.320 --> 10:15.260
The fundraiser is over with 142% funds raised.

10:15.260 --> 10:17.760
They raised $2.1 million.

10:17.760 --> 10:21.200
But they're doing something interesting, too.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.940
They're leaving the pre-orders open.

10:24.940 --> 10:26.880
So if you still want a Librem 5,

10:26.880 --> 10:30.480
you can pre-order one right now and still get it.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.780
So while the fundraiser's over,

10:32.780 --> 10:35.320
they'll still take orders for it.

10:35.320 --> 10:38.080
Librem 5, it's funded.

10:38.080 --> 10:42.000
Now, as we've said before, the hard work begins.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.160
But they've just recently announced a deal with,

10:45.160 --> 10:48.340
or I guess a partnership with Nextcloud.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.040
So they're gonna ship Nextcloud's apps by default

10:52.040 --> 10:55.360
on the PureOS devices and on the Librem.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.280
They've obviously, they've talked with the

10:57.280 --> 11:00.400
plasma mobile folks, the GNOME desktop people, the Matrix.

11:00.400 --> 11:04.920
They've been creating this network of partnerships

11:04.920 --> 11:08.520
with the big names in open source right now.

11:08.520 --> 11:11.340
Not the only, but big names in open source right now.

11:11.340 --> 11:13.880
Nextcloud is a bit of an open source celebrity project.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.840
Matrix, again, a bit of an open source celebrity project.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.880
GNOME and Plasma, obviously huge heavyweights

11:18.880 --> 11:20.580
with large fan bases.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.000
And they're all kinda coming together

11:23.000 --> 11:24.600
on this Librem 5 thing.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.000
Why is this the first time we're seeing this?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.360
Why didn't we see this earlier?

11:29.360 --> 11:31.360
I guess the time's just kinda right.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.920
Yeah, all the projects are in the right position.

11:34.920 --> 11:38.840
Yeah, and good enough places have had enough polished,

11:38.840 --> 11:40.360
let's say, releases where they feel like

11:40.360 --> 11:41.560
these kinds of things are things

11:41.560 --> 11:44.240
they can dedicate energy to.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.080
I don't know.

11:46.400 --> 11:50.160
Anyways, I am surprised, to be honest with you,

11:50.160 --> 11:51.760
that they made it this far.

11:51.760 --> 11:55.000
I thought the goal of 1.5 million was achievable,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.800
but a long shot, and they surpassed it.

11:56.800 --> 12:01.800
And however this fundraiser went,

12:01.800 --> 12:03.480
now we actually see what the results

12:03.480 --> 12:04.320
gonna be when they ship the hardware.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.120
Yes, this'll be the really interesting part.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.920
Okay, well, wow, congratulations to them.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.000
I'm really surprised.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.360
I've also seen rumors coming out of them

12:10.360 --> 12:11.720
that they're gonna be shipping tablets.

12:11.720 --> 12:14.520
They wanna work on a NAS.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.040
And of course, they've also recently announced

12:17.040 --> 12:19.640
that they've disabled the Intel Management Engine stuff,

12:19.640 --> 12:21.320
which we talked about on Linux Action News,

12:21.320 --> 12:22.680
if you'd like to check that out.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.320
But yeah, anybody in the Discord room?

12:25.320 --> 12:26.160
Oh, that's weird.

12:26.160 --> 12:29.800
Anybody there in the Mumble Discord thing?

12:30.920 --> 12:32.520
Have a take on the Librem 5 funding,

12:32.520 --> 12:35.360
or maybe a hope or a dream or a wish?

12:35.360 --> 12:37.280
Wish upon a star for a Librem 5?

12:37.280 --> 12:39.240
Oh, go ahead, JJ.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.200
I saw you light up.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.560
I don't hear you though.

12:43.560 --> 12:44.560
It's all right.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.840
JJ, you're excused.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.160
I don't know that I'm ready to buy one,

12:47.160 --> 12:49.600
but I would like to have friends and acquaintances

12:49.600 --> 12:51.800
who have them, and you get to see them in real life.

12:51.800 --> 12:52.880
That would be exciting for me.

12:52.880 --> 12:56.560
Yeah, they're starting to tempt me,

12:56.560 --> 12:59.480
but I think I'm not particularly motivated

12:59.480 --> 13:01.800
to be an early adopter on my phone anymore.

13:01.800 --> 13:05.840
Maybe if I didn't own a business and have kids.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.880
Or if carrying two phones was a thing

13:07.880 --> 13:10.360
that someone could do realistically.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.000
But I would be willing to do it

13:12.000 --> 13:13.560
if I started to see this thing ship

13:13.560 --> 13:16.560
and it looked like it was a viable,

13:16.560 --> 13:19.760
if even in an early stage, but a viable product.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.760
I'd be willing to carry two phones for a while

13:23.760 --> 13:26.440
as I sort of tried this thing out,

13:26.440 --> 13:27.600
and then eventually switch over.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.800
I could do that.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.680
So I could be willing to get in that position eventually.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.920
The competition is tough these days though.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.520
I wonder if there's any angle to,

13:35.520 --> 13:37.360
like their focus on freedom and security,

13:37.360 --> 13:39.520
if there's any angle towards journalists

13:39.520 --> 13:40.680
or other people who are really conscious

13:40.680 --> 13:43.600
and really need to know what's going on with their phone.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.240
Maybe you don't use it when you're at home in the States,

13:45.240 --> 13:46.920
but you're traveling to Russia to do a story

13:46.920 --> 13:49.280
and you want something that you have more control over.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.400
And it really gives people in the open source community

13:51.400 --> 13:55.360
who have held really, really steady to this principle

13:55.360 --> 13:57.080
of I'm not going to use a mobile phone

13:57.080 --> 14:02.080
because it violates either my privacy or my freedoms

14:02.080 --> 14:06.520
or my personal views of technology.

14:06.520 --> 14:07.920
There's a lot of reasons why people have just chosen

14:07.920 --> 14:09.520
I'm not going to get a smartphone.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.160
And maybe this would be a phone

14:11.160 --> 14:12.160
that might appeal to some of them.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.000
It's not a huge market.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.060
It's not going to make a company millions of dollars,

14:15.060 --> 14:17.560
but there may be a loyal customer base there

14:17.560 --> 14:20.240
if you can make a product that actually serves them.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.100
We'll wait and see.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.400
It's still a lot of this stuff up in the air,

14:23.400 --> 14:25.280
but I could see it.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.120
I could see it.

14:26.120 --> 14:26.960
I could see it.

14:26.960 --> 14:27.920
And now that they made their funding,

14:27.920 --> 14:29.880
I'm hoping they'll be able to ship a few.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.160
Let's talk a little bit about Fedora

14:31.160 --> 14:32.520
because we've been talking a lot about Ubuntu

14:32.520 --> 14:34.440
and we still are going to talk about Ubuntu a bit more today.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.160
We have some news, too.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.200
But I thought, well, then we should take a moment

14:38.200 --> 14:40.320
to talk about Fedora just to make sure we talk

14:40.320 --> 14:43.000
about some hard work that's happening over there.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.760
They felt that way, too.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.880
They took to their blog over there.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.440
This is Christian who he blogs quite a bit

14:49.440 --> 14:51.360
about the development of GNOME.

14:51.360 --> 14:54.240
And he took to his blog right around the release of Ubuntu

14:54.240 --> 14:56.360
in 1710 and said, well, let's take a look

14:56.360 --> 14:59.720
at where Fedora's coming from and where it's going.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.760
And so he says, while we're putting the touches

15:01.760 --> 15:04.520
on the final finishing touches on Fedora 27,

15:04.520 --> 15:06.600
I'll try to look back at everything we've achieved

15:06.600 --> 15:09.280
since Fedora Workstation was launched with Fedora 21.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.200
So we're going back to about Fedora 21.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.080
This blog is about taking stock and taking some pride

15:14.080 --> 15:16.800
in what we've achieved so far and major hurdles

15:17.680 --> 15:18.840
that we've passed along our way

15:18.840 --> 15:21.600
to improve the Linux desktop experience.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.520
First one on this list, Wayland.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.600
We've been the biggest contributor

15:24.600 --> 15:25.760
since we joined the effort, he says.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.320
But lib input is another area

15:27.320 --> 15:29.640
we think we've made a big difference.

15:29.640 --> 15:32.840
GLVND, which deals with multiple OpenGL devices.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.760
Porting Firefox GTK3, Google Drive integration.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.520
Flatpak gets a mention.

15:41.840 --> 15:42.960
Could come back to that in a minute.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.640
The Linux firmware service, GNOME software,

15:45.640 --> 15:49.560
MP3 and AC3 support and AAC support landing in Fedora.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.000
And a few other things like working

15:51.000 --> 15:53.160
with some improved touch support,

15:53.160 --> 15:56.720
Nautilus improvements, the nightlight mode in GNOME

15:56.720 --> 15:59.840
that makes it a little easier on the eyes after the sun sets.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.600
And some other GNOME shell improvements.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.040
And of course, one of my favorites,

16:03.040 --> 16:06.720
GNOME Builder and PipeWire have been projects

16:06.720 --> 16:07.880
they've worked on, including other ones

16:07.880 --> 16:10.360
that are important specifically to Fedora,

16:10.360 --> 16:14.560
like Fleet Commander and a few other things.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.720
It's actually a pretty impressive list.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.640
I have the entire thing linked in the show notes.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.720
And I thought, you know what, it is fair.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.760
It is fair to take a moment and say,

16:21.760 --> 16:24.320
Ubuntu 17.10 was a really great release.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.840
And it's because they're able to stand on the shoulders

16:26.840 --> 16:29.960
of what the GNOME 3 community has been building now

16:29.960 --> 16:31.480
for years and years and years.

16:31.480 --> 16:34.640
If 17.10 had launched when GNOME 3 was new,

16:34.640 --> 16:36.840
and they were shipping GNOME 3 years and years ago,

16:36.840 --> 16:38.640
it would have been a train wreck of a release.

16:38.640 --> 16:39.680
Oh yeah, definitely.

16:39.680 --> 16:42.000
So yeah, I thought, okay, fair enough.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.440
At first I was giving them a hard time

16:43.440 --> 16:45.560
for kind of doing a me too post

16:45.560 --> 16:47.440
right around Ubuntu 17.10's release.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.040
I was like, oh, come on Fedora.

16:49.040 --> 16:51.680
It's okay, we haven't forgotten about you guys.

16:51.680 --> 16:52.880
But then I read that list and I'm like,

16:52.880 --> 16:55.800
damn, that is a list, that is a really great list.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.440
Like the Linux Vendor Firmware Project,

16:58.440 --> 17:00.280
you know that's a personal favorite of mine.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.200
LibInput has made a huge improvement

17:02.200 --> 17:05.360
for using trackpads under GNU slash Linux.

17:05.360 --> 17:07.500
And of course, it's really important for going to Wayland.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.480
Yeah, the list really cements the feeling I have like,

17:09.480 --> 17:11.480
well, I may not use Fedora desktop

17:11.480 --> 17:15.720
on a lot of workstations I actually have.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.760
They just do a lot of really important backend work

17:19.760 --> 17:21.280
that you don't necessarily appreciate.

17:21.280 --> 17:24.080
Circling back to Flatpak, I've been trying to take stock.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.520
You know, Flatpak's had a couple of delays in Fedora

17:26.520 --> 17:28.080
for where they wanted to be at right now.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.400
So I'm like, where's the adoptions?

17:29.400 --> 17:31.800
We've had a lot of conversations about Snap,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.600
a lot of people talking about Snaps.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.920
So what metric do you measure success, right?

17:36.920 --> 17:39.960
Well, I have a metric that perhaps we could use.

17:39.960 --> 17:44.280
The piracy metric, porn and piracy, what are they using?

17:44.280 --> 17:47.040
Which Universal Linux packaging format

17:47.040 --> 17:48.280
are the pirates using?

17:48.280 --> 17:50.760
And it appears to be so far, Flatpak.

17:50.760 --> 17:51.600
Hey, yo.

17:51.600 --> 17:55.680
Yeah, pirates are now packaging Windows games with Flatpak

17:55.680 --> 17:58.160
because they can bundle like a little wine

17:58.160 --> 17:59.560
or DOSBox runtime in there.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.200
Like they've got like this whole way

18:01.200 --> 18:04.840
to distribute Windows games on Linux now using Flatpaks.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.040
So here's your use.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.360
Open source for the win.

18:07.360 --> 18:11.480
And on the Waraz site,

18:11.480 --> 18:13.440
because you know, on these platforms

18:13.440 --> 18:15.920
where all your stuff is commercial

18:15.920 --> 18:18.120
and you got to pay for everything,

18:18.120 --> 18:22.800
this is like something that's like a huge market,

18:22.800 --> 18:24.120
like stealing software.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.320
Like the open source community,

18:25.320 --> 18:26.440
we don't even have to worry about this.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.400
It's just in our repos, but here, you know,

18:28.400 --> 18:29.600
they have to describe what you're getting.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.120
So they say Flatpak is a new package management system

18:32.120 --> 18:34.960
built for simple universal single click installations,

18:34.960 --> 18:39.960
games that just work neatly stuffed in a locked sandbox.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.720
It's perfect for them.

18:41.720 --> 18:42.560
So there you go.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.880
Flatpak, the choice of Windows software pirates

18:45.880 --> 18:48.960
for games on Linux around the world.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.920
If that's not a niche market, I don't know what is.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.960
Year of the pirate Linux desktop?

18:52.960 --> 18:53.800
I'm not sure.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.640
I mean, if you think about it though, you know,

18:55.640 --> 18:56.880
you download a Flatpak

18:56.880 --> 18:59.320
and you just have a full wine setup all done for you.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.320
Right, I know.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.600
It could be the choice for Linux pirates.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.640
It's kind of like what,

19:03.640 --> 19:06.320
it's kind of like a shades of what Ikey's working on

19:06.320 --> 19:08.520
with the Linux Steam integration project,

19:08.520 --> 19:09.960
but for just one specific game.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.640
So when are actual game developers

19:11.640 --> 19:13.280
gonna start releasing games in Flatpak?

19:13.280 --> 19:16.560
Right, right, or, you know, it seems like app images

19:16.560 --> 19:18.480
would make a lot of sense for game developers.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.640
And I could see snaps too,

19:19.640 --> 19:21.840
especially if you wanna make it easy on people.

19:22.840 --> 19:23.960
But what about the maintainers?

19:23.960 --> 19:26.160
What about the distro maintainers?

19:26.160 --> 19:27.600
Let's talk about maintainers for a moment.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.680
Wes found this really interesting piece

19:29.680 --> 19:33.600
over on snowyman.com, manipulating maintainers.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.720
And he says the alternative title really could be

19:36.720 --> 19:39.080
how to get members of any open source community

19:39.080 --> 19:41.240
to be interested in helping you,

19:41.240 --> 19:44.160
but manipulating maintainers is a catchier title.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.000
It sure is.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.640
And he makes a core point right here

19:46.640 --> 19:48.000
at the beginning of the piece

19:48.000 --> 19:50.440
that really smacked me in the face.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.040
And it's, God, is this not true?

19:52.040 --> 19:54.080
It's so true in Linux podcasting,

19:54.080 --> 19:55.880
quote unquote, Linux media space too.

19:55.880 --> 19:59.360
He says there's an old ha ha, only but serious joke.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.120
If you go to a Linux forum

20:01.120 --> 20:04.080
and you ask for help fixing your wifi driver,

20:04.080 --> 20:05.440
everyone will ignore you.

20:06.440 --> 20:09.320
If you instead say, Linux sucks,

20:09.320 --> 20:12.280
you can't even get wifi to work,

20:12.280 --> 20:13.680
then thousands of people

20:13.680 --> 20:15.800
will try to solve the problem for you.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.320
So if you just say Linux sucks, it can't get wifi,

20:18.320 --> 20:19.560
all of a sudden everybody wants to help.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.840
But if you say, I need help with wifi, nobody helps.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.080
This story is a great example of manipulating people,

20:25.080 --> 20:26.880
but it's obviously a negative take on it.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.800
I'd like to share some thoughts on this

20:28.800 --> 20:30.880
from a much more positive standpoint,

20:30.880 --> 20:32.920
which will help you get people to pay more attention,

20:32.920 --> 20:35.080
be more helpful, and perhaps most importantly,

20:35.080 --> 20:38.080
create a healthier open source community overall.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.560
And he touches on core points

20:39.560 --> 20:41.440
to getting involved with open source communities,

20:41.440 --> 20:43.080
like don't waste people's time,

20:43.080 --> 20:44.040
demonstrate that you've actually

20:44.040 --> 20:45.480
tried to solve your problem.

20:45.480 --> 20:46.480
That's a huge one, yeah.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.480
Help other people, don't be rude,

20:48.480 --> 20:50.760
and he gives examples of what might come across rude

20:50.760 --> 20:52.480
and what you could maybe say instead.

20:52.480 --> 20:54.680
And I know some of this sounds like basic stuff,

20:54.680 --> 20:56.680
but it's a good read, it's insightful.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.560
Say thank you, admit if you're new,

20:58.560 --> 21:01.000
offer to help, and maybe consider giving money.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.640
It's not a universal, and to be clear,

21:02.640 --> 21:04.160
don't necessarily think they're asking for it,

21:04.160 --> 21:07.600
but sometimes people just need a little cash

21:07.600 --> 21:09.120
to help make something a priority.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.320
I think that example at the top really just shows

21:11.320 --> 21:12.920
that here we're talking about motivations.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.960
I know for me, all right, so you respond in anger,

21:14.960 --> 21:16.360
someone's dissing your favorite OS,

21:16.360 --> 21:17.320
and you're like, well, I'm gonna show them,

21:17.320 --> 21:18.680
yeah, it's super easy.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.080
You're just responding, and it's not the interaction

21:21.080 --> 21:22.840
any of us want, and it's not really the solution here,

21:22.840 --> 21:24.720
but you're not thinking about,

21:24.720 --> 21:26.360
I know I've certainly seen requests for help,

21:26.360 --> 21:28.600
and when they're vague, you're like, well, I just don't.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.240
You imagine all the work you're gonna be in here

21:30.240 --> 21:32.520
trying to understand this person's problem and identifying,

21:32.520 --> 21:33.800
and then once you've started helping,

21:33.800 --> 21:36.360
you feel this obligation to continue helping.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.240
That's not really so when you're just responding like,

21:38.240 --> 21:40.240
yeah, of course Wi-Fi works, try this, right?

21:40.240 --> 21:42.680
And so all of these tips help show

21:42.680 --> 21:43.680
and make it more reasonable.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.760
So if someone has a very specific problem,

21:45.760 --> 21:48.200
you're like, oh, okay, I wanna figure out what's going on too.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.040
I don't have to wade through the 10 steps

21:50.040 --> 21:53.000
of introductory debugging that this person may

21:53.000 --> 21:53.960
or may not have done.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.880
So if you can get any of those barriers lower,

21:56.880 --> 21:58.160
you have a much better time.

21:58.160 --> 22:03.240
Yeah, I think it's a lot about how you approach it too.

22:03.240 --> 22:07.720
If you come into it with sort of a, more of a, not humble,

22:07.720 --> 22:10.120
because that makes it sound like you have to tiptoe around,

22:10.120 --> 22:12.120
but if you come at it with,

22:12.120 --> 22:14.440
maybe I don't have the full context

22:14.440 --> 22:16.120
when you ask your question,

22:16.120 --> 22:18.920
and then realize that sometimes those strong reactions too

22:18.920 --> 22:22.000
are because you're not asking the right question,

22:22.000 --> 22:24.280
and so people respond negatively.

22:24.280 --> 22:25.760
And so sometimes you have to come in with the understanding

22:25.760 --> 22:26.840
maybe I'm getting this response

22:26.840 --> 22:29.560
because I've asked something outside the context

22:29.560 --> 22:32.120
of where I'm supposed to ask it or something.

22:32.120 --> 22:32.960
What about you, Beard?

22:32.960 --> 22:36.160
You are involved in God knows how many IRC communities,

22:36.160 --> 22:37.920
Discord chat rooms.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.960
You must see people stumble into the rooms

22:39.960 --> 22:41.840
and communities you hang out in all the time

22:41.840 --> 22:43.640
and just blow it from time to time.

22:43.640 --> 22:47.520
Yeah, I mean, basically just be nice

22:47.520 --> 22:51.000
and don't act like you know everything,

22:52.000 --> 22:54.480
and you'll pretty much get all the help you need.

22:55.800 --> 22:59.120
Yeah, that's even true when you think

22:59.120 --> 22:59.960
you're an expert on something.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.120
I had a moment one time

23:01.120 --> 23:03.360
where I was troubleshooting a network problem.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.000
Table unplugged, yeah, I know.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.600
It was close.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.280
It was really close.

23:10.280 --> 23:14.360
It was like a loop because I had a hub loop.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.680
I had some sort of network loop.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.040
Oh, yeah.

23:17.040 --> 23:20.360
But I thought it was an ISP problem.

23:20.360 --> 23:21.520
And so I'm talking to the tech,

23:21.520 --> 23:23.280
and I'm like 45 minutes into it,

23:23.280 --> 23:25.560
and I'm generally a very nice person on the phone,

23:25.560 --> 23:29.040
maybe too nice, but I got a show I gotta do.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.720
45 minutes into it, I start going, look, man.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.000
All right, I've done the router reboot thing.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.080
I've done all the little troubleshooting things you want.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.440
Here's what, I can ping this.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.280
I can traceroute this.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.440
I'm just giving them all this information.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.360
I've fixed networks for a living.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.280
Can we just skip all this stupid bullshit

23:44.280 --> 23:47.040
and just work on getting a trouble ticket established

23:47.040 --> 23:48.680
for a connection issue?

23:48.680 --> 23:49.520
And the guy's like, well,

23:49.520 --> 23:51.240
could you just do me one more favor?

23:51.240 --> 23:53.040
Could you go down and just check to see

23:53.040 --> 23:54.720
if you have any hubs plugged into each other

23:54.720 --> 23:56.080
or anything weird that could be causing

23:56.080 --> 23:57.800
some sort of network loop?

23:57.800 --> 23:59.800
Fine, I think to myself.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.680
And I go down, and I check the switch.

24:01.680 --> 24:02.840
It's fine, everything's fine.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.360
I'm like, idiot, this guy's such an idiot.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.600
And I'm huffing and puffing my way back up to the stairs

24:06.600 --> 24:08.960
where I left the phone, and it crosses my mind.

24:08.960 --> 24:13.080
Hey, dumbass, you have a little hub out

24:13.080 --> 24:17.160
where your NAS and your Wi-Fi access point is in the garage.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.000
That could be where your problem's at, smart guy.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.240
And I go, oh, crap.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.120
I walk back down the stairs, out into the garage,

24:22.120 --> 24:24.040
and sure enough, I had a network loop,

24:24.040 --> 24:25.600
and I had to go pick up the phone and be like,

24:25.600 --> 24:29.080
okay, I'm sorry, yep, that did resolve the problem.

24:29.080 --> 24:30.280
Thank you for your time.

24:30.280 --> 24:33.160
Just stuffed this whole crow right down the gullet.

24:33.160 --> 24:35.080
That's why I heard that, goddammit, Noah.

24:35.080 --> 24:39.480
Yeah, yes, actually, that did happen, didn't it?

24:39.480 --> 24:42.000
That was actually a separate time.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.960
From that lesson I learned that's usually just Noah's fault

24:44.960 --> 24:47.320
is actually what I learned from that.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.600
Yeah, all right, well, that was good.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.200
If anybody in the, oh, I see, Bashful,

24:50.200 --> 24:52.120
you had something you wanted to jump in with.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.520
I'd love to hear, go ahead.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.760
That was more so earlier when you were talking

24:55.760 --> 24:58.360
about the communities and stuff.

24:58.360 --> 24:59.200
No, go ahead.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.440
For example, Rika, I was saying just ask, be nice,

25:01.440 --> 25:02.280
all that kind of stuff,

25:02.280 --> 25:03.680
but it's also the sense of entitlement

25:03.680 --> 25:07.280
that you have to, things like have an answer immediately

25:07.280 --> 25:10.240
or that people are gonna be online 24 by seven

25:10.240 --> 25:11.560
or so on and so forth.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.800
They just expect you to be there nonstop.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.160
Right, yeah, so that's the hard thing.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.120
So the entitlement thing is hard

25:19.120 --> 25:20.960
because nobody wants to be told

25:20.960 --> 25:23.840
that they have a sense of entitlement.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.160
Nobody wants to hear that.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.280
So that's a real off-putting thing.

25:27.280 --> 25:30.000
And then the second problem is nobody realizes

25:30.000 --> 25:31.840
they have a self-entitlement problem

25:31.840 --> 25:34.320
because they just are coming in like their time of day.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.440
So they're up, and you sometimes don't stop and go,

25:37.440 --> 25:39.000
well, these people might be on the other end of the world.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.080
They might be asleep right now.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.640
Yeah, that's actually one of the things you see

25:41.640 --> 25:43.280
the most often in support channels

25:43.280 --> 25:46.680
is you see somebody come in, ask a question, and leave.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.560
Or come in, ask a question,

25:48.560 --> 25:50.560
complain that nobody's talking, and leave.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

25:52.000 --> 25:52.840
And if they would just idle for a bit.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.200
And it's all within like two minutes.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.920
Yeah, idle for a day.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.520
Yeah, it's just more of a perception thing

25:57.520 --> 25:58.760
on both sides of the fence.

25:58.760 --> 26:01.920
Like I don't mean it in sort of the point of view

26:01.920 --> 26:05.280
that people can't expect an answer or should or shouldn't.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.880
It's just more so both sides of the fence

26:06.880 --> 26:09.040
need to be conscious of the fact

26:09.040 --> 26:11.760
that there are things like time zones, availability,

26:11.760 --> 26:13.720
families, all that other kind of stuff.

26:13.720 --> 26:15.440
Yeah, good points.

26:15.440 --> 26:19.160
Okay, so I would say we could make a little room

26:19.160 --> 26:21.800
in next week's episode if anybody in the audience

26:21.800 --> 26:24.200
has a couple that they feel like we've left out,

26:24.200 --> 26:26.240
especially anybody involved in some open source communities

26:26.240 --> 26:29.960
where there's something specifically on your list

26:29.960 --> 26:31.160
that people do. Yeah, definitely.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.040
You know, your shit list.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.400
Let us know, leave a comment,

26:34.400 --> 26:36.840
or go to the subreddit, linuxunpluggedatreddit.com,

26:36.840 --> 26:37.960
and leave it on this week's episode.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.080
And if we get a couple of good ones,

26:39.080 --> 26:40.640
I'll carve out some time in next week's episode

26:40.640 --> 26:43.040
to try to include those because I think it's kind of

26:43.040 --> 26:45.920
particularly important for an open source community

26:45.920 --> 26:49.360
when a lot of people are constantly coming in

26:49.360 --> 26:51.040
that have never interacted with different communities,

26:51.040 --> 26:52.040
and it's different cultures,

26:52.040 --> 26:56.000
and different people use online platforms differently,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.880
and people email me all the time

26:58.880 --> 27:00.880
thinking I'm gonna respond maybe that day,

27:00.880 --> 27:02.440
or maybe within a few days,

27:02.440 --> 27:04.800
and sometimes it's like four or five months

27:04.800 --> 27:06.400
before you get a response from me.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.120
And I don't mean for it to be like that,

27:09.120 --> 27:10.720
but that's just what happens sometimes,

27:10.720 --> 27:13.360
and it's a stressful thing for me to go in my inbox

27:13.360 --> 27:15.600
because I know I have a bunch of old emails

27:15.600 --> 27:18.240
where people expected me to respond faster

27:18.240 --> 27:20.280
because that's how they do email.

27:21.560 --> 27:22.800
And that's the same thing.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.680
You just have to understand that people

27:24.680 --> 27:26.520
have different expectations for these systems.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.400
Especially in the open source world.

27:28.400 --> 27:29.920
All right, well before we move on,

27:29.920 --> 27:31.320
let's mention Ting for just a moment.

27:31.320 --> 27:34.040
My mobile service provider, oh, it's Ting.

27:34.040 --> 27:37.560
You go over to linux.ting.com.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.600
That'll give you $25 off a Ting device,

27:39.600 --> 27:43.200
or maybe even better because if you can bring a Ting device,

27:43.200 --> 27:44.920
they'll give you $25 in credit,

27:44.920 --> 27:47.720
which will probably pay for more than your first month.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.440
It's pay for what you use wireless.

27:49.440 --> 27:53.120
It's really great because take Beardsley here.

27:54.520 --> 27:55.360
He's mine?

27:55.360 --> 27:58.600
Hey, you know, Chris, I actually have a new Ting Sim.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.400
Ting-sponsored TwitchCon.

28:01.400 --> 28:02.240
Oh, really?

28:02.240 --> 28:04.560
So you just got an extra ready-to-go Sim,

28:04.560 --> 28:05.600
like a standby Sim?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.880
Just sitting in my room.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.440
Yeah, that's nice.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.560
But you know, for Beardsley, it's a great example.

28:10.560 --> 28:15.560
So JB has a Ting account with like three lines on there,

28:15.600 --> 28:16.960
I think, maybe even four lines,

28:16.960 --> 28:18.360
and one of the lines we give to Beards,

28:18.360 --> 28:20.800
so that way he has a phone where we can get a hold of him,

28:20.800 --> 28:22.320
and he has a little device that he can use

28:22.320 --> 28:24.000
to take over the world.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.280
And most of the time, Beardsley's somewhere

28:26.280 --> 28:28.440
that has Wi-Fi, almost all the time.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.440
But he traveled to TwitchCon,

28:30.440 --> 28:32.040
and during that time,

28:32.040 --> 28:34.160
it'll be like a little more for service.

28:34.160 --> 28:37.240
But if you take the fact that maybe this month,

28:37.240 --> 28:39.880
we're gonna pay $15 more, maybe at most,

28:39.880 --> 28:41.040
for his usage,

28:42.880 --> 28:44.280
but you average that out over the fact

28:44.280 --> 28:46.040
that we almost pay for nothing most of the time

28:46.040 --> 28:48.160
when he's on Wi-Fi, it's a great deal.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.480
There is definitely a data spike.

28:49.480 --> 28:52.960
Yeah, and I know of at least one phone call,

28:52.960 --> 28:53.800
because I got one.

28:53.800 --> 28:57.040
Oh, but it's perfect for that kind of setup.

28:57.040 --> 28:57.880
It's great for me too,

28:57.880 --> 29:01.560
because with a little bit of planning,

29:01.560 --> 29:03.520
I can preload my podcast for the day,

29:03.520 --> 29:05.760
I can pin the music to my device,

29:05.760 --> 29:10.040
and when I'm driving, I can basically use no data,

29:10.040 --> 29:12.360
and then when I get to work, I can use Wi-Fi.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.000
Man, it's so great, because it's nationwide.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.600
When I travel, I use it the entire time.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.360
They have CDMA and GSM.

29:17.360 --> 29:19.920
There's no contracts, there's no other termination fees.

29:19.920 --> 29:22.000
So if Beard wants to throw that SIM card

29:22.000 --> 29:24.360
in a tablet for a couple of months,

29:24.360 --> 29:26.080
and then decides, I'm not really ever using it,

29:26.080 --> 29:27.440
there's no penalty to just turn it off.

29:27.440 --> 29:29.120
You go into their dashboard, it's simple,

29:29.120 --> 29:30.000
and you can control it there.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.960
You can also monitor all your usage.

29:31.960 --> 29:33.280
They have so many different devices

29:33.280 --> 29:34.920
you can pick from or bring your own.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.720
Like I mentioned, they have a CDMA and a GSM network,

29:37.720 --> 29:39.720
so there's tons of options there.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.240
Check out their blog too.

29:41.240 --> 29:44.480
They have a blog right now about earning some side cash.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.880
It's a little bit of extra money, whoa,

29:46.880 --> 29:48.400
off of Google opinion rewards.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.080
So check that out too on the Ting blog.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.560
Start by going to linux.ting.com,

29:52.560 --> 29:57.560
support the show, and sign up over at ting, linux.ting.com.

29:58.360 --> 29:59.480
Let's get into the Ubuntu corner.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.200
So we have some Ubuntu news to get to.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.000
Yeah, as you would expect after a big major release.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.400
And ever since the announcement

30:07.400 --> 30:09.400
that they would be switching to the GNOME desktop,

30:09.400 --> 30:12.120
discontinuing active development on Unity,

30:12.120 --> 30:14.120
and restructure the company a bit,

30:14.120 --> 30:17.240
all of us armchair analysts like myself specifically,

30:17.240 --> 30:18.440
I'll just talk about me,

30:19.400 --> 30:23.280
all said, ah, ha, ha, ha, here we go.

30:23.280 --> 30:26.520
Mark Shuttleworth is refactoring the company,

30:26.520 --> 30:29.080
getting it ready perhaps for some funding here and there,

30:29.080 --> 30:33.240
and eventually to go public, do an IPO.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.480
And it seems that is exactly the case.

30:36.480 --> 30:39.240
He was interviewed over at eWeek.com.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.760
We've got a link in the show notes by Sean.

30:41.760 --> 30:44.360
And some interesting things were revealed by Mark.

30:44.360 --> 30:47.760
He said that as long as we stay a private company,

30:47.760 --> 30:51.280
we have complete discretion as to whether we,

30:51.280 --> 30:53.400
maybe I should read this in like a more epic voice for Mark,

30:53.400 --> 30:54.440
even though it doesn't sound like,

30:54.440 --> 30:57.040
as long as we stay purely a private company,

30:57.040 --> 30:58.360
we have complete discretion

30:58.360 --> 30:59.840
as to whether we carry things

30:59.840 --> 31:03.680
that are not commercially sustainable, Shuttleworth said.

31:03.680 --> 31:04.880
Now what he's really saying there

31:04.880 --> 31:06.280
is when we're a private company,

31:06.280 --> 31:07.840
we can dump money into projects

31:07.840 --> 31:08.960
that don't make us any money.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.520
JB has that luxury,

31:10.520 --> 31:12.480
a luxury which we may sometimes maybe abuse.

31:12.480 --> 31:15.280
And as perhaps Canonical was potentially abusing,

31:15.280 --> 31:17.120
because if you look at it from a perspective

31:17.120 --> 31:19.840
of maybe a company that needs to make money

31:19.840 --> 31:22.960
or a company that wants to go public, then things change.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.880
You can't necessarily really justify that.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.280
And then Mark goes on to say,

31:26.280 --> 31:29.600
what you'll see at some stage soon

31:29.600 --> 31:32.720
is that we have broken even on all the pieces

31:32.720 --> 31:35.280
that we do commercially without Unity,

31:35.280 --> 31:36.880
as in Ubuntu makes money,

31:36.880 --> 31:39.080
the server stuff makes, the cloud stuff makes money,

31:39.080 --> 31:40.880
the consulting stuff is making money,

31:40.880 --> 31:42.280
the OEM deals are making money.

31:42.280 --> 31:43.680
They're becoming self-sustainable.

31:43.680 --> 31:45.400
If you go outside the Unity projects,

31:45.400 --> 31:46.680
Unity 8, stuff like that.

31:46.680 --> 31:48.320
At some stage after that,

31:48.320 --> 31:50.320
we will take a round of investment,

31:50.320 --> 31:52.760
which will be a growth round

31:52.760 --> 31:55.640
that will be aimed at helping us become a public company

31:55.640 --> 31:57.160
in due course.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.000
So there you go.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.280
Yeah, all right.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.040
And- Big stuff in the works.

32:02.040 --> 32:03.520
Yeah, that's what it means, basically.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.560
There's nothing too shocking,

32:04.560 --> 32:06.400
nothing too majorly revealed there.

32:06.400 --> 32:07.640
It's all kind of what we speculated,

32:07.640 --> 32:10.040
but the speculation in this case was correct.

32:10.040 --> 32:12.840
And I think it's gonna result

32:12.840 --> 32:15.320
in a lean, mean, canonical machine, actually.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.160
Like, no hard feelings.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.000
They tried it.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.960
They did the whole, the phone thing.

32:18.960 --> 32:22.760
They played with Unity and Mir and Go in their own way

32:22.760 --> 32:24.600
and innovating on the Linux desktop.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.160
Turns out that's not really what the market wants

32:27.160 --> 32:28.320
or how things are gonna go.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.800
And so, yeah, there's a smart pivot

32:29.800 --> 32:31.280
back to what their core is.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.720
He mentioned shutting down Unity

32:33.720 --> 32:36.040
being one of the toughest things he's ever had to do.

32:36.040 --> 32:36.880
I bet.

32:36.880 --> 32:37.720
I'm sure, right?

32:37.720 --> 32:39.680
I mean, there's obviously a ton of people there,

32:39.680 --> 32:41.640
engineers, developers, designers,

32:41.640 --> 32:43.200
everyone pouring their heart into it.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.800
So that's hard.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.200
And he went out specifically on a limb himself

32:47.200 --> 32:48.600
to try to say, let's do this as the future.

32:48.600 --> 32:49.440
And then nobody bit.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.640
And then he's like, oh God, now I gotta own up to that.

32:51.640 --> 32:52.640
And he did it.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.120
JJ, you had something you wanted to say.

32:54.120 --> 32:54.960
Go ahead.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.360
We've had bad luck

32:58.360 --> 33:00.760
with people being muted or something today.

33:00.760 --> 33:01.840
There's a scoreboard.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.480
I don't know if it's Discord or.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.800
I think it might just be JJ.

33:04.800 --> 33:05.640
Yeah.

33:05.640 --> 33:06.480
Yeah.

33:06.480 --> 33:07.320
Oh.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.040
What do you got?

33:10.040 --> 33:12.360
You got some sort of switch flipped over there, JJ.

33:12.360 --> 33:15.960
You got like some sort of like NSA privacy screen up.

33:15.960 --> 33:18.080
What's going on up there?

33:18.080 --> 33:19.200
Must be using FreeBSD.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.040
There is a.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.400
I think he's using the lead one five, that's.

33:22.400 --> 33:25.040
There is a video interview of Mark over on the E-Week website

33:25.040 --> 33:25.960
if you want to see that.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.960
The beautiful thing about Ubuntu is

33:27.960 --> 33:30.000
we created the possibility of a platform

33:30.000 --> 33:32.280
that's free of charge to its end users

33:32.280 --> 33:34.440
with commercial services in mind.

33:34.440 --> 33:38.160
In the sort of dream that might define the future

33:38.160 --> 33:39.920
in all sorts of different ways.

33:39.920 --> 33:43.400
And we really have seen that Ubuntu has moved

33:43.400 --> 33:45.320
into the mainstream in a bunch of areas.

33:45.320 --> 33:47.560
You know, you think about it

33:47.560 --> 33:49.560
and you watch the full video on their site.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.080
It's really good timing still for them

33:52.080 --> 33:55.040
because the desktop thing is sort of sorting itself out.

33:55.040 --> 33:57.000
Wes and I were just having the conversation earlier

33:57.000 --> 33:59.720
that desktop Linux in a lot of ways

33:59.720 --> 34:02.080
has gotten really, really, really good recently.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.760
Like we just read that list from the Fedora project.

34:04.760 --> 34:07.000
That's a solid list of really good stuff.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.040
Ubuntu 17.10, all three of us are still using it

34:11.040 --> 34:12.320
after that review.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.200
We're like, we're actually still working pretty good for me.

34:14.200 --> 34:15.640
And I've put it on even more systems.

34:15.640 --> 34:19.320
And that was without, like I've hardly configured a thing.

34:19.320 --> 34:21.440
And we have some good stuff like PipeWire in the work soon

34:21.440 --> 34:23.200
that's gonna solve some really longstanding issues

34:23.200 --> 34:24.040
that I've had.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.200
You might even be able to get audio

34:25.200 --> 34:27.320
on the machine you use for the show.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.160
I don't know.

34:28.160 --> 34:29.480
That's the pipe dream.

34:29.480 --> 34:33.080
And so like that problem is sort of solving itself

34:33.080 --> 34:35.880
because you then have OEMs that are then taking

34:35.880 --> 34:37.800
that product that's getting pretty good.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.320
And then they're doing the marketing,

34:39.320 --> 34:41.640
targeting at developers and the niche market.

34:41.640 --> 34:43.200
Yeah, they're doing the polishing

34:43.200 --> 34:45.720
and you have same system 76 trying to do the same thing

34:45.720 --> 34:48.000
to a greater extent with Pop!OS.

34:48.000 --> 34:52.400
And then they can focus on the cloud and IoT

34:52.400 --> 34:54.640
where there is a ton of traction to be gained.

34:54.640 --> 34:57.280
And they have a pretty good in-road already.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.880
So it does seem like they have a pretty good chance

34:59.880 --> 35:02.520
of making this thing a money-making machine.

35:02.520 --> 35:07.520
I gotta say it takes some big cojones to cut your losses

35:07.920 --> 35:10.080
rather than doubling down again.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.360
Mm-hmm, yeah.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.280
Chris. Yes, sir.

35:14.280 --> 35:19.280
I don't wanna reveal anything that's a company confidential

35:19.840 --> 35:24.560
but back in April when Mark announced the end of life

35:24.560 --> 35:25.960
of some of these projects

35:25.960 --> 35:29.680
and it was clearly a difficult thing for him to do

35:29.680 --> 35:33.820
with letting go a bunch of people in the canonical family.

35:35.880 --> 35:40.880
I found it interesting that I saw a different side of Mark

35:40.880 --> 35:45.800
very keen on the welfare of the people

35:45.800 --> 35:47.560
who were leaving the company.

35:47.560 --> 35:50.560
He knew that he couldn't continue to fund these things,

35:50.560 --> 35:55.560
that it wasn't possible for us to continue developing

35:56.240 --> 35:57.600
all these different projects

35:57.600 --> 36:01.680
that were super interesting and cool and fun

36:01.680 --> 36:03.420
but at the end of the day,

36:03.420 --> 36:06.080
they wouldn't make money in the real world.

36:06.080 --> 36:11.080
And I think he felt really terrible

36:11.380 --> 36:12.820
having to let those people go.

36:13.820 --> 36:17.500
And I think some people see Mark

36:17.500 --> 36:19.740
as a very hard-headed businessman.

36:20.780 --> 36:23.740
And when you look at how much he's financed,

36:23.740 --> 36:26.520
not just Ubuntu but he's used a lot of his money

36:26.520 --> 36:29.800
for other things as well, philanthropic stuff

36:29.800 --> 36:33.060
but also other open source projects.

36:33.060 --> 36:34.460
He's used some of that money

36:34.460 --> 36:37.680
to fund some other distributions, not just Ubuntu.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.300
I think it's interesting to see this news come out now

36:42.300 --> 36:47.300
that actually it's a little sad for him

36:50.240 --> 36:52.220
that things didn't work out.

36:52.220 --> 36:54.900
Yeah, well, who in their right mind

36:54.900 --> 36:57.940
creates something like a project like this?

36:57.940 --> 37:00.020
I mean, nobody gets into this stuff

37:00.020 --> 37:03.960
to have to make these really, really awfully hard

37:03.960 --> 37:06.900
sucky business decisions that only business owners

37:06.900 --> 37:09.820
or people in that position end up having to make,

37:09.820 --> 37:11.420
people in that top role.

37:11.420 --> 37:14.380
And it's gotta be hard to see.

37:14.380 --> 37:17.740
These are real people who've been brought

37:17.740 --> 37:19.580
into the whole Ubuntu ecosystem.

37:19.580 --> 37:23.420
A lot of the people who work for Canonical then and now

37:23.420 --> 37:26.100
are ex-community people who were hired in

37:26.100 --> 37:28.260
because they were active in the community

37:28.260 --> 37:30.820
and they wanted to do cool things with Ubuntu.

37:30.820 --> 37:32.580
And there was this guy who came along

37:32.580 --> 37:37.380
and enabled them to sit at home in their office

37:37.380 --> 37:39.220
and work on stuff that's super cool.

37:39.220 --> 37:41.380
And there aren't many opportunities you get in your life

37:41.380 --> 37:46.380
to sit at home and work on something super cool with friends.

37:47.380 --> 37:48.620
And he enabled that.

37:48.620 --> 37:51.540
And I think it's a little sad.

37:51.540 --> 37:56.540
And this recent interview coming out is difficult

37:57.180 --> 38:00.620
for those of us looking back on the difficult times

38:00.620 --> 38:01.860
back in April.

38:01.860 --> 38:04.980
But equally, we've got a positive thing to look forward to,

38:04.980 --> 38:07.500
which is the company is streamlined

38:07.500 --> 38:09.680
and we're not spreading ourselves super thin

38:09.680 --> 38:12.960
across a large number of projects that we used to.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.780
I mean, I think a common criticism that I used to have

38:15.780 --> 38:19.860
is they have too many projects, they're too distracted,

38:19.860 --> 38:22.940
there's no chance they're gonna get into mobile.

38:22.940 --> 38:27.940
And those were just common, those were criticisms

38:28.960 --> 38:31.820
I might lob, but they were just common ones

38:31.820 --> 38:32.660
that would be parroted.

38:32.660 --> 38:33.900
Yeah, everyone said that.

38:33.900 --> 38:35.700
Yeah, and I don't know, who's saying that now?

38:35.700 --> 38:37.740
Because none of those things are true anymore.

38:37.740 --> 38:39.820
Like the focus seems to make a lot of sense.

38:39.820 --> 38:42.100
The end results are pretty impressive so far.

38:42.100 --> 38:46.180
And we're not even privy to all of the ongoing back end

38:46.180 --> 38:49.060
business deals that are profitable to Canonical

38:49.060 --> 38:51.220
that are also a result of this work.

38:51.220 --> 38:54.140
But they are happening and they are-

38:54.140 --> 38:56.500
It was interesting to see Mark point out

38:56.500 --> 38:59.420
that there are areas of the business that are profitable,

38:59.420 --> 39:00.900
obviously as a privately held company,

39:00.900 --> 39:03.860
he doesn't have to reveal details about how profitable

39:03.860 --> 39:05.380
each part of the company is.

39:05.380 --> 39:08.700
But on the road to IPO, he's going to have to reveal

39:08.700 --> 39:12.340
some of this to potential investors in the future.

39:12.340 --> 39:15.540
But it was interesting to reveal that something

39:15.540 --> 39:17.500
a lot of us internally have known for a while,

39:17.500 --> 39:20.980
that this is more profitable than people think.

39:20.980 --> 39:23.460
Well, Canonical has, from my experience,

39:23.460 --> 39:26.020
and this is something that was very apparent

39:26.020 --> 39:29.780
just at the rally too, is they have a unique combo going

39:29.780 --> 39:31.740
in that they're making the software,

39:31.740 --> 39:34.580
they're selling the support, and the Ubuntu brand

39:34.580 --> 39:36.900
is carrying quite a bit of weight in enterprise now.

39:36.900 --> 39:40.580
And so a lot of big companies that are scaling out

39:40.580 --> 39:44.420
very, very fast, you could think of large media companies

39:44.420 --> 39:47.940
online that you know of, or just large web companies

39:47.940 --> 39:49.540
that you know of that are scaling very fast,

39:49.540 --> 39:51.660
perhaps they're in a growth trajectory right now.

39:51.660 --> 39:53.900
And scaling out large data centers

39:53.900 --> 39:55.740
is a massive time commitment.

39:55.740 --> 39:57.500
They know that their system runs on Ubuntu,

39:57.500 --> 39:59.740
they know that they want Ubuntu-based data centers,

39:59.740 --> 40:01.780
but they want somebody who really knows their shit

40:01.780 --> 40:03.140
and somebody who will keep it up to date

40:03.140 --> 40:05.780
and running well and secure, because damn,

40:05.780 --> 40:07.700
isn't cyber security an issue now?

40:07.700 --> 40:10.340
And man, do we not want to have to be the ones responsible

40:10.340 --> 40:11.180
for managing that?

40:11.180 --> 40:12.620
Well, guess who we can call?

40:12.620 --> 40:15.060
We call Canonical, because they're making the thing.

40:15.060 --> 40:17.700
So now all of a sudden, Canonical's got a contract

40:17.700 --> 40:20.140
to build out a data center, load the software,

40:20.140 --> 40:22.340
and then maintain the software.

40:22.340 --> 40:24.060
And Canonical can either hand the keys over to them

40:24.060 --> 40:25.860
and say, here's your data center, or they can say,

40:25.860 --> 40:28.340
actually, you know what, funny thing,

40:28.340 --> 40:30.340
we don't feel like hiring 15 people,

40:30.340 --> 40:33.820
do you guys just wanna take care of that for us?

40:33.820 --> 40:36.700
And there are multiple ways for Canonical

40:36.700 --> 40:39.840
to make revenue by Ubuntu being free.

40:39.840 --> 40:43.000
And they all seem obvious, because they seem like ones

40:43.000 --> 40:45.700
that corporate America would just totally click with.

40:45.700 --> 40:47.780
Like that is an arrangement that would make sense

40:47.780 --> 40:50.580
to corporate IT people, especially people

40:50.580 --> 40:52.700
that are evaluating risk and time to get something spun up.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.880
It's a no-brainer for them,

40:54.880 --> 40:57.700
and that's gonna be an obvious moneymaker.

40:57.700 --> 40:59.980
And then we know that they have an OEM program

40:59.980 --> 41:01.660
with companies like Dell and HP,

41:01.660 --> 41:04.220
where there's some kind of arrangement

41:04.220 --> 41:06.060
where there's money made on machines that are sold

41:06.060 --> 41:08.140
that also is profitable.

41:08.140 --> 41:12.520
And so with that, we have now to look forward to 1804.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.600
And now we are almost out of the Ubuntu section,

41:14.600 --> 41:15.580
for those of you that are sick and tired

41:15.580 --> 41:17.040
of hearing about it.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.900
I know some of you couldn't care less.

41:18.900 --> 41:20.580
This is a great little title, though.

41:20.580 --> 41:22.540
I'm enjoying it immediately already.

41:22.540 --> 41:24.080
Yeah, I know, and we just got it, this is news.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.260
And it'll be like this probably

41:26.260 --> 41:28.740
for like maybe a half another episode,

41:28.740 --> 41:32.720
because we have in the works an interview

41:32.720 --> 41:35.680
with some friends from Canonical

41:35.680 --> 41:38.940
that worked really hard specifically on the 1710 release,

41:38.940 --> 41:42.020
and we're gonna hopefully get them in next week's episode,

41:42.020 --> 41:44.020
as well as a couple follow-up items.

41:44.020 --> 41:47.980
But we now have, before we get out of the Ubuntu corner,

41:47.980 --> 41:49.480
a name.

41:49.480 --> 41:53.800
Beavering Away at the Brilliantly Bionic 1804,

41:53.800 --> 41:56.340
Mark Shalloworth today posted on his blog

41:56.340 --> 42:01.140
the name of 1804 Ubuntu, and it is the bionic beaver.

42:01.140 --> 42:02.320
The bionic beaver.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.100
There are so many B-words in this post.

42:04.100 --> 42:04.940
It's pretty good. It's incredible.

42:04.940 --> 42:07.340
Yeah, he has some fun.

42:07.340 --> 42:09.220
There's a line in here that maybe I could poke

42:09.220 --> 42:11.380
Popey's brain about that I feel like maybe

42:11.380 --> 42:14.420
I should know more about, and this was sort of news to me.

42:14.420 --> 42:16.640
He says in one of his paragraphs here

42:16.640 --> 42:20.820
that there's an IRC channel people can join

42:20.820 --> 42:23.900
to work with those who are updating Unity 7

42:24.900 --> 42:28.000
for the newest X and kernel graphics in 1804.

42:29.140 --> 42:34.140
So, is that a community project to keep Unity 7 going?

42:34.300 --> 42:36.820
So, I think there's a number of people

42:36.820 --> 42:39.340
who have come out of the woodwork saying,

42:39.340 --> 42:41.860
you know what, I actually quite like Unity 7,

42:41.860 --> 42:44.780
and I would like it to carry on working the way I like it.

42:44.780 --> 42:47.940
Now, I appreciate it's like Marmite.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.860
Like, not everyone likes Unity.

42:49.860 --> 42:50.700
Of course.

42:50.700 --> 42:53.620
There are people like i3 or Gnome Shell

42:53.620 --> 42:54.460
or whatever else takes place.

42:54.460 --> 42:56.840
Marte, Asma, XFCE.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.260
Yeah, exactly.

42:58.260 --> 43:01.340
But, turns out we shipped a bunch of machines

43:01.340 --> 43:04.300
through hardware vendors that had Unity by default,

43:04.300 --> 43:06.380
and a lot of people actually quite like that.

43:06.380 --> 43:10.300
And we have noticed a lot of community people

43:10.300 --> 43:11.620
who've rallied around and said,

43:11.620 --> 43:13.740
we'd like to help keep that going.

43:13.740 --> 43:16.580
Now, it's great to have community people

43:16.580 --> 43:17.900
who are interested in keeping that going,

43:17.900 --> 43:19.860
but what we really need is developers

43:19.860 --> 43:23.140
because we need people to be able to review patches

43:23.140 --> 43:25.940
and understand bug reports, triage them,

43:25.940 --> 43:27.500
all the kind of usual stuff you do

43:27.500 --> 43:30.260
in the development cycle of a desktop.

43:30.260 --> 43:32.700
And we would love to keep Unity 7

43:32.700 --> 43:35.780
well alive through 18.04 and beyond.

43:35.780 --> 43:38.600
It will be pretty much in maintenance mode.

43:38.600 --> 43:41.580
It might be that there could be some new features landing,

43:41.580 --> 43:43.900
but given that the fact that Unity 7

43:43.900 --> 43:47.140
is still active in 16.04,

43:47.140 --> 43:48.180
like I'm running it right now,

43:48.180 --> 43:51.580
I'm talking to you from my Unity 7 laptop,

43:52.420 --> 43:55.900
it's not that we're just going to throw it over the wall

43:55.900 --> 43:58.420
and to GitHub and say, there you go.

43:58.420 --> 43:59.820
It's still hosted on Launchpad.

43:59.820 --> 44:01.720
We still have all the build system in place.

44:01.720 --> 44:04.140
We still have the bug tracker in place and so on.

44:04.140 --> 44:06.420
So if we've got people in the community

44:06.420 --> 44:09.020
who want to get involved in that,

44:09.020 --> 44:11.260
then get in contact with us.

44:11.260 --> 44:14.300
There's a thread going on on the Ubuntu Community Hub.

44:14.300 --> 44:17.100
If you go to community.ubuntu.com, you'll find it easily.

44:17.100 --> 44:19.460
It's the thread that says Unity 7 in it.

44:20.380 --> 44:22.060
And if you're a developer

44:22.060 --> 44:25.060
and you want to see Unity 7 continue,

44:25.060 --> 44:27.080
jump on board and we'll get this thing

44:27.080 --> 44:30.660
continue rolling through 18.04 and beyond.

44:30.660 --> 44:32.420
I would love an echo effect there, but-

44:32.420 --> 44:34.060
Beyond, beyond, beyond, beyond.

44:34.060 --> 44:34.880
I'll be your backup guy.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.580
I am, I'm not surprised.

44:37.580 --> 44:41.100
Not going to say I'm surprised at all by this development.

44:41.100 --> 44:42.860
In fact, I now feel kind of stupid

44:42.860 --> 44:44.420
that we didn't have a betting pool going,

44:44.420 --> 44:47.740
but part of me, for some reason,

44:47.740 --> 44:50.100
feels like this is the desktop environment to run

44:50.100 --> 44:52.180
on the OBS system.

44:52.180 --> 44:55.900
I like Unity 7 enough and I want something-

44:55.900 --> 44:56.740
Yeah, at the end,

44:56.740 --> 44:58.100
I really didn't have any major problems with it.

44:58.100 --> 44:59.460
Literally.

44:59.460 --> 45:02.620
How long have we had this machine running now, Beard?

45:02.620 --> 45:05.200
I mean, it's been since Linux Fest, right?

45:05.200 --> 45:06.040
Yeah.

45:06.980 --> 45:07.820
At least, yeah.

45:07.820 --> 45:09.020
And that's the thing.

45:09.020 --> 45:12.380
It just keeps rocking and keeps rolling along

45:12.380 --> 45:13.220
and along and along.

45:13.220 --> 45:15.300
It's literally the least trouble I've had.

45:15.300 --> 45:16.140
Right.

45:16.140 --> 45:19.740
We're not making massive multi-infrastructural changes

45:19.740 --> 45:21.420
to Unity 7.

45:21.420 --> 45:22.900
There's bug fixes, sure.

45:22.900 --> 45:24.060
There are bugs in Unity 7.

45:24.060 --> 45:24.900
We all know that.

45:24.900 --> 45:26.540
There are bugs in Compiz and Nuxt

45:26.540 --> 45:29.740
and the other components that make up Unity 7 experience.

45:29.740 --> 45:31.420
And if people want to get involved,

45:31.420 --> 45:32.600
we'd love to hear from you.

45:32.600 --> 45:36.300
But yeah, we'd love it to stay alive.

45:36.300 --> 45:37.900
But Compiz is still maintained, right?

45:37.900 --> 45:40.020
That is actually still being actively maintained.

45:40.020 --> 45:44.180
So in a way, that's sort of the core part of Unity 7

45:44.180 --> 45:45.380
that really needs any TLC.

45:45.380 --> 45:47.540
And if there's even somebody just nudging that along

45:47.540 --> 45:50.280
to make sure it still works with X or whatever.

45:51.260 --> 45:54.580
I think a lot of it will be integrating with new stuff

45:54.580 --> 45:56.740
that comes along and making sure it still works

45:56.740 --> 46:00.440
on new versions of whatever components come along

46:00.440 --> 46:02.580
within the next six months.

46:02.580 --> 46:06.280
It's a short cycle between now and April next year.

46:06.280 --> 46:10.400
I know that the desktop team don't have a huge amount

46:10.400 --> 46:11.560
of time to dedicate to this

46:11.560 --> 46:13.960
because they're obviously working on the LTS,

46:13.960 --> 46:15.720
which is going to be Gnome Shell based.

46:15.720 --> 46:18.840
But I'm sure there are people there who would mentor people

46:18.840 --> 46:20.640
in the community who want to get involved in this.

46:20.640 --> 46:23.760
And if you're interested, I'd love to hear from you.

46:23.760 --> 46:24.760
What a hell of a thing.

46:24.760 --> 46:26.300
I'm going to seriously give it a consideration

46:26.300 --> 46:29.680
for the OBS rig, because it's worked so damn well

46:29.680 --> 46:30.960
for the other Skype machine.

46:30.960 --> 46:32.160
When I say it's a Skype machine,

46:32.160 --> 46:34.240
it runs like a dozen other apps too,

46:34.240 --> 46:35.500
just for different tasks.

46:35.500 --> 46:37.640
Like one of them is it runs a digital version

46:37.640 --> 46:38.880
of our soundboard.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.680
I have it up right now on the screen.

46:40.680 --> 46:42.040
I have, isn't that great?

46:42.040 --> 46:42.880
Yeah, it's awesome.

46:42.880 --> 46:43.700
It is so great.

46:45.120 --> 46:48.900
Our soundboard has a Linux client

46:48.900 --> 46:51.960
that connects over Ethernet, over IP,

46:51.960 --> 46:56.800
and it is exactly synced by the millisecond.

46:56.800 --> 46:59.520
And if I move a slider on the digital soundboard,

46:59.520 --> 47:02.000
it physically moves the slider with the motor

47:02.000 --> 47:03.400
on the physical soundboard, yeah.

47:03.400 --> 47:05.600
If I didn't have a Dan's face there during tech snap,

47:05.600 --> 47:06.440
that's going to be right there.

47:06.440 --> 47:07.840
Oh yeah, it's a real winner.

47:07.840 --> 47:10.720
But you want your machine to be pretty rock solid

47:10.720 --> 47:12.440
that you're controlling your soundboard from,

47:12.440 --> 47:13.960
and this has been the one.

47:13.960 --> 47:17.400
And I really, really like Solus.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.160
I've really enjoyed Budgie,

47:19.160 --> 47:22.680
but we had about 25 minutes this morning.

47:22.680 --> 47:23.840
It's kind of unbelievable.

47:23.840 --> 47:26.080
Yeah, of like, GNOME MPV has died

47:26.080 --> 47:28.200
for the third or fourth time,

47:28.200 --> 47:31.800
and this time it's blaming, ironically, I think,

47:31.800 --> 47:36.320
lib systemd.so.0, which is really great.

47:36.320 --> 47:38.160
We don't talk about such things.

47:38.160 --> 47:41.100
And I'm in the process of trying to do all the updates,

47:41.100 --> 47:42.040
even the optional ones,

47:42.040 --> 47:43.640
just trying to get the system working again.

47:43.640 --> 47:46.160
And I've had some weirdness in the software center

47:46.160 --> 47:47.860
where it said I had like 46 updates,

47:47.860 --> 47:50.880
and then I hit apply and it's like 146 updates.

47:50.880 --> 47:52.160
It was a big discrepancy.

47:53.880 --> 47:57.640
And those kinds of things, they're not a big problem,

47:57.640 --> 48:00.480
but it did delay the show by a pretty good factor today.

48:00.480 --> 48:01.720
I don't know.

48:01.720 --> 48:03.520
I feel like you just don't have that problem.

48:03.520 --> 48:05.400
Not having a functioning video player

48:05.400 --> 48:07.400
and not having audio are pretty big problems.

48:07.400 --> 48:09.680
Yeah, I'm trying to be nice because I really like Solus.

48:09.680 --> 48:10.600
I really like, and I don't,

48:10.600 --> 48:14.640
I might've got caught mid-update cycle or who knows.

48:14.640 --> 48:17.840
So I can't really say what the problem was.

48:17.840 --> 48:19.320
And that doesn't necessarily mean

48:19.320 --> 48:20.560
there's not a place for Solus, right?

48:20.560 --> 48:22.400
Like this machine can dual boot.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.680
You can play with multiple things.

48:23.680 --> 48:24.520
Oh yeah, absolutely.

48:24.520 --> 48:25.360
A lot of this we ended up talking about

48:25.360 --> 48:27.200
the appliance machines where you just don't,

48:27.200 --> 48:28.480
you don't want to fuss.

48:28.480 --> 48:30.800
Now we're in a place with snaps and just

48:30.800 --> 48:33.800
using newer Ubuntu's where you have enough of the,

48:33.800 --> 48:34.640
you know what I mean?

48:34.640 --> 48:36.880
Like, okay, 12.04, OBS wasn't really a thing.

48:36.880 --> 48:38.360
You couldn't expect an updated package,

48:38.360 --> 48:41.880
but in the 17 and 18 worlds, you get a recent build,

48:41.880 --> 48:43.160
let alone their snaps.

48:43.160 --> 48:45.280
Took them a few days, but now there is a new build.

48:45.280 --> 48:47.680
And Docker and other, it's kind of a different world.

48:47.680 --> 48:48.520
That's true.

48:48.520 --> 48:51.240
Where an Ubuntu LTS can fit a lot more roles now.

48:51.240 --> 48:53.220
So not only are people in general

48:53.220 --> 48:54.560
updating their repos faster.

48:54.560 --> 48:58.440
So when 17.10 came out, there was no OBS package for 17.10,

48:58.440 --> 48:59.960
but you know, you check three or four days later,

48:59.960 --> 49:01.580
now there's an OBS package.

49:01.580 --> 49:04.260
And snaps and flat packs also neutralize

49:04.260 --> 49:06.300
that particular problem, like you're saying.

49:06.300 --> 49:09.660
There is several, yeah, no, it's true.

49:09.660 --> 49:13.480
There are several solutions that are converging together

49:13.480 --> 49:16.520
to solve the software availability problem

49:16.520 --> 49:18.160
for all distributions.

49:18.160 --> 49:20.160
Depending on which particular methodology you subscribe to,

49:20.160 --> 49:22.200
there's multiple of them, there's multiple now.

49:22.200 --> 49:25.160
And that means, like you're saying,

49:25.160 --> 49:30.040
it would be conceivable to just, to take a little time

49:30.040 --> 49:32.800
and have like that classic reason

49:32.800 --> 49:34.520
why a lot of us switched to Linux,

49:34.520 --> 49:36.320
because Windows was so crashy

49:36.320 --> 49:39.340
and you wanted the most rock solid system possible.

49:39.340 --> 49:40.840
Like, I'm gonna get back to that.

49:40.840 --> 49:45.840
Like maybe I'll just use Unity 7 on 18.04

49:45.880 --> 49:49.240
with just a few confined applications.

49:49.240 --> 49:51.500
And I bet you that thing would run

49:51.500 --> 49:55.360
until the day that 18.04 was no longer supported.

49:55.360 --> 49:56.360
That sounds really appealing to me.

49:56.360 --> 49:57.840
That doesn't mean I'm gonna do that on my laptop

49:57.840 --> 50:01.280
or my main workstation, but the three or four machines,

50:01.280 --> 50:03.220
one, two, three, four machines,

50:03.220 --> 50:05.500
that we need five machines that we might reload in here.

50:05.500 --> 50:06.960
Yeah, I might do it to those.

50:06.960 --> 50:09.040
The other nice thing, which I'm still loving,

50:09.040 --> 50:10.640
is just you get the ZFS module,

50:10.640 --> 50:13.640
you don't have to do any wacky DKMS or precompile.

50:13.640 --> 50:15.540
So like, we can also do that

50:15.540 --> 50:16.960
and then take snapshots of machines

50:16.960 --> 50:17.800
that are particularly important

50:17.800 --> 50:20.400
so we can have restores or easy backups.

50:20.400 --> 50:22.200
There's still a lot of options going on here.

50:22.200 --> 50:24.000
What I'm hearing is Wes is upgrading the studio.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.080
I think that's what's happening.

50:25.080 --> 50:26.880
Yep, I just signed up for it.

50:26.880 --> 50:29.400
So this discussion about reloading the machines

50:29.400 --> 50:30.520
in the studio, it's happening.

50:30.520 --> 50:33.200
This is something I've been working on

50:33.200 --> 50:37.200
slowly over last week, after our episode last week.

50:37.200 --> 50:38.040
Hello, hello.

50:38.040 --> 50:41.320
You know, I heard somebody told me this recently

50:41.320 --> 50:42.680
that they never hear the airplanes that we mentioned,

50:42.680 --> 50:43.520
so I'm gonna stop mentioning

50:43.520 --> 50:44.520
if there's airplanes flying overhead.

50:44.520 --> 50:45.360
Yeah, if you guys can't hear it,

50:45.360 --> 50:46.360
it'll just be our little secret.

50:46.360 --> 50:47.920
Yeah, we'll all be the only ones that know.

50:47.920 --> 50:49.200
Anyways, back on track.

50:49.200 --> 50:50.720
This week, I started loading

50:50.720 --> 50:53.640
like my lower priority systems to 1710.

50:53.640 --> 50:57.160
And I've been working my way up the chain to the studio.

50:57.160 --> 50:58.800
And now I'm at the studio.

50:58.800 --> 51:01.440
And so I wanted to take a moment

51:01.440 --> 51:05.160
and figure out another solution

51:05.160 --> 51:06.960
while we're in this transition.

51:06.960 --> 51:09.200
And that's when it really struck me,

51:09.200 --> 51:12.400
this is a case for setting up a remote desktop environment.

51:12.400 --> 51:14.180
One on the LAN and one in the cloud.

51:14.180 --> 51:17.520
So that way, why we destroy the installations

51:17.520 --> 51:20.000
of these machines, and then begin to reset them up

51:20.000 --> 51:22.440
with all the little teensy-tinesy things we need.

51:22.440 --> 51:24.760
In a pinch, when I'm on air,

51:24.760 --> 51:28.040
I could remote into a system that is completely configured,

51:28.040 --> 51:29.560
has been for maybe a couple of weeks

51:29.560 --> 51:31.320
before the transition even started.

51:31.320 --> 51:33.080
So it's well used.

51:33.080 --> 51:34.300
It's been well set up.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.360
I can remote into that box.

51:37.360 --> 51:39.380
And it doesn't matter if the system here in the studio

51:39.380 --> 51:40.720
is a blank slate.

51:40.720 --> 51:42.160
Because inside that remote session,

51:42.160 --> 51:43.620
I'll have everything I need.

51:43.620 --> 51:44.680
But to make that work,

51:44.680 --> 51:48.320
it has to be extremely high-performant.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.520
Because I wanna be able to show visuals on the screen.

51:50.520 --> 51:52.840
I can't have crazy, weird lag.

51:52.840 --> 51:53.680
I can't-

51:53.680 --> 51:54.800
It's gotta meet your regular standards

51:54.800 --> 51:56.440
for a desktop usable system.

51:56.440 --> 51:57.400
Yeah, and if possible,

51:57.400 --> 51:59.320
I'd like to use it for work during the day.

51:59.320 --> 52:01.280
So I'd like it to be pretty responsive.

52:01.280 --> 52:02.760
So that's pretty responsive

52:02.760 --> 52:04.560
and maybe even support video playback.

52:04.560 --> 52:07.680
And so that is what led me down this path

52:07.680 --> 52:09.520
to where I'm at today.

52:09.520 --> 52:14.520
And I would say this is still somewhat in flux.

52:14.520 --> 52:15.920
Like one of the things I'm considering

52:15.920 --> 52:18.080
is instead of using the Monte desktop,

52:18.080 --> 52:19.600
maybe try a system,

52:19.600 --> 52:22.200
like a parallel system running XFCE.

52:22.200 --> 52:23.040
You know what?

52:23.040 --> 52:23.860
I'll explain why in a moment.

52:23.860 --> 52:24.700
Because Monte has been pretty good,

52:24.700 --> 52:27.580
but I have had a couple of hiccups.

52:27.580 --> 52:28.920
So if you're considering doing this,

52:28.920 --> 52:30.320
I wanna pre-warn you.

52:30.320 --> 52:31.640
It might not be a big deal,

52:31.640 --> 52:32.880
but I just wanna pre-warn you.

52:32.880 --> 52:34.040
So let's take a moment.

52:35.400 --> 52:36.800
Let's think DigitalOcean.

52:37.640 --> 52:40.960
Go to digitalocean.com, create the account.

52:40.960 --> 52:42.520
And use our promo code Linux Unplugged.

52:42.520 --> 52:46.040
It's a way to get really fast systems

52:46.920 --> 52:47.760
up in their infrastructure,

52:47.760 --> 52:51.000
which is data centers all over the world within seconds.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
SSDs for every system you deploy

52:53.000 --> 52:55.800
and a beautiful dashboard to manage all of it.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.200
And there's still a few days left

52:57.200 --> 52:58.920
to get in on this Hacktober fest.

52:58.920 --> 53:00.320
Are you hip to this Hacktober stuff?

53:00.320 --> 53:03.080
No, tell me more, tell me more.

53:03.080 --> 53:04.840
Well, first of all, DigitalOcean is just pretty awesome

53:04.840 --> 53:06.060
because this at the end of the day

53:06.060 --> 53:08.520
is just supporting a bunch of open source projects.

53:08.520 --> 53:09.920
It's getting open source code written

53:09.920 --> 53:11.680
and then giving people some swag for doing it.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.880
Did I get a t-shirt if I do this maybe?

53:13.880 --> 53:15.280
Yeah, you actually, you'd be good at this.

53:15.280 --> 53:18.040
So Hacktober fest is open to everyone in the world.

53:18.040 --> 53:19.160
Poll requests can be made

53:19.160 --> 53:21.640
on any GitHub hosted repository or project.

53:21.640 --> 53:25.540
And you sign up anytime between October 1st and October 31st.

53:25.540 --> 53:29.160
You make four poll requests between October 1st and 31st

53:29.160 --> 53:30.920
in any time zone.

53:30.920 --> 53:32.640
It can be to any public repo on GitHub,

53:32.640 --> 53:34.400
not just the ones that they've highlighted.

53:34.400 --> 53:35.840
The poll request must contain

53:35.840 --> 53:37.480
commits you've made yourself,

53:37.480 --> 53:39.960
poll requests reported by maintainers of spam,

53:39.960 --> 53:41.880
or they are automated, will be marked as invalid.

53:41.880 --> 53:42.720
It won't count.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.120
But they have a couple of examples here.

53:45.120 --> 53:46.760
And they're all open source projects.

53:46.760 --> 53:48.440
And there's some open source projects

53:48.440 --> 53:49.680
we talk about all the time.

53:49.680 --> 53:51.560
Some of them are less known.

53:52.840 --> 53:55.000
Like here's one for Discord, discord.net.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.160
That's interesting.

53:56.160 --> 53:57.760
Thanks.

53:57.760 --> 54:01.240
They had a Rocket Chat on here earlier.

54:01.240 --> 54:03.320
They have nw.js on here.

54:03.320 --> 54:05.000
They have Hugo, which is really interesting.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.560
It's a really cool, flexible static site generator.

54:07.560 --> 54:08.400
Written in Go.

54:08.400 --> 54:10.960
Yeah, and so the idea is just to give a little help

54:10.960 --> 54:13.440
and exposure to some of these open source projects

54:13.440 --> 54:17.480
and then also give away some swag.

54:17.480 --> 54:18.520
So that's their Hacktoberfest.

54:18.520 --> 54:19.600
It goes to the end of the month

54:19.600 --> 54:22.000
and it's open to anybody in the whole dang world.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.160
Digitalocean.com.

54:23.160 --> 54:24.520
Go there, try them out.

54:24.520 --> 54:26.640
I'm gonna be talking about them in this coming segment

54:26.640 --> 54:30.120
because one of the two remote desktop sessions I've set up

54:30.120 --> 54:31.840
is running on DigitalOcean.

54:31.840 --> 54:33.220
And one of the things I did

54:33.220 --> 54:35.800
is I got the three cents an hour system.

54:35.800 --> 54:40.800
And then I attached 100 gigabytes of block storage,

54:41.080 --> 54:42.960
which I am dedicating just to my home directory.

54:42.960 --> 54:44.520
That's on spinning rust, right?

54:44.520 --> 54:45.360
That's like really slow.

54:45.360 --> 54:46.720
That's all SSDs, my friend.

54:46.720 --> 54:47.560
Okay, okay.

54:47.560 --> 54:48.400
Yeah, yeah.

54:48.400 --> 54:50.520
In fact, it's extremely fast.

54:50.520 --> 54:52.180
It's nuts, nuts fast.

54:52.180 --> 54:54.440
In fact, I invite you to play around with it.

54:54.440 --> 54:55.820
It's really satisfying.

54:55.820 --> 54:58.400
And so I just dedicated from 100 gigs

54:58.400 --> 55:01.880
of DigitalOcean block storage to my droplet

55:01.880 --> 55:03.120
that runs remote desktop.

55:03.120 --> 55:05.220
So I have a big old home drive,

55:05.220 --> 55:06.480
which I really, really like.

55:06.480 --> 55:07.840
They have a new object storage system

55:07.840 --> 55:09.240
they call Spaces as well.

55:09.240 --> 55:11.360
And the network is blazing fast.

55:11.360 --> 55:13.860
40 gigabit connections coming into their hypervisors.

55:13.860 --> 55:14.700
Go check them out.

55:14.700 --> 55:18.040
Go to DigitalOcean.com and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

55:18.920 --> 55:20.400
It's DigitalOcean.com.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.360
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

55:22.360 --> 55:23.920
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean

55:23.920 --> 55:26.840
for sponsoring this year Linux Unplugged program.

55:26.840 --> 55:29.760
So yeah, I'm using X2GO.

55:29.760 --> 55:31.400
And I'm using it with Ubuntu MATE.

55:31.400 --> 55:33.560
And it's pretty good.

55:33.560 --> 55:35.000
I'll give you guys a demo here in a minute

55:35.000 --> 55:36.600
if you're watching, you'll see.

55:36.600 --> 55:38.720
But even if you're listening, I'll describe it to you.

55:38.720 --> 55:42.360
And to make this all hum, I'm using X2GO

55:42.360 --> 55:44.480
on top of Ubuntu MATE 17.10.

55:44.480 --> 55:46.300
17.10 for both the systems.

55:46.300 --> 55:47.800
To do that on DigitalOcean at this point,

55:47.800 --> 55:49.960
I had to install a 17.04 image.

55:49.960 --> 55:53.280
And then I did an upgrade to 17.10, which went fine.

55:53.280 --> 55:54.120
Just totally fine.

55:54.120 --> 55:56.000
It was a pretty clean base system too.

55:56.920 --> 55:58.860
I even realized I could have snapshoted it

55:58.860 --> 55:59.700
if anything had gone wrong.

55:59.700 --> 56:00.540
But I just didn't.

56:00.540 --> 56:01.960
Yeah, use them features.

56:01.960 --> 56:06.960
Yeah, and what I love, love, love about X2GO

56:07.360 --> 56:09.640
is that you can run it on a headless system

56:09.640 --> 56:11.440
that doesn't have a full X setup,

56:11.440 --> 56:13.360
doesn't have a monitor, mouse, and keyboard.

56:13.360 --> 56:16.640
So it works on a system that's just up in a rack somewhere.

56:16.640 --> 56:21.080
And X2GO is a graphical remote desktop

56:21.080 --> 56:23.360
that works really well over low bandwidth connections.

56:23.360 --> 56:25.040
It has a lot of scaling options.

56:25.040 --> 56:26.420
It has the ability to disconnect

56:26.420 --> 56:27.960
and then reconnect to a session.

56:27.960 --> 56:29.160
So I can be working, close it,

56:29.160 --> 56:30.640
come down into the studio and reconnect.

56:30.640 --> 56:32.500
Everything's right back where I left it off.

56:32.500 --> 56:33.960
It has sound redirection.

56:33.960 --> 56:37.880
It's a little wonky sometimes, but it supports pulse audio.

56:37.880 --> 56:40.920
And it has support for shared folders,

56:40.920 --> 56:42.880
which I have not really tried.

56:42.880 --> 56:43.920
I did not know that.

56:43.920 --> 56:45.920
Yeah, my understanding is it's using SFTP

56:45.920 --> 56:46.880
on the backend to do that.

56:46.880 --> 56:48.160
Though I guess you could set up,

56:48.160 --> 56:49.600
there's a lot of options for that.

56:49.600 --> 56:52.720
Yeah, all the traffic is tunneled over SSH.

56:52.720 --> 56:55.320
And so everything's going over SSH.

56:55.320 --> 56:58.320
What makes X2GO cooler than just say like

56:58.320 --> 57:00.840
straight old traditional X1140?

57:00.840 --> 57:01.680
Because a lot of people would just say,

57:01.680 --> 57:03.720
well, we'll just use SSH with X1140

57:03.720 --> 57:06.680
and then you don't need to install any extra packages.

57:06.680 --> 57:09.720
But X2GO uses the NX library,

57:09.720 --> 57:11.940
which was developed by No Machine.

57:11.940 --> 57:14.840
And they stopped releasing it as open source

57:14.840 --> 57:15.680
a little while ago.

57:15.680 --> 57:19.360
But X2GO is based off the last released open source version

57:19.360 --> 57:21.520
and it has been approved upon.

57:21.520 --> 57:26.520
And it has basically solved all of the latency intensive

57:26.520 --> 57:29.040
parts of X1140.

57:29.040 --> 57:32.440
And they've worked around those really latency intensive

57:32.440 --> 57:35.200
parts by creating an NX proxy on each side

57:35.200 --> 57:36.040
of the network connection.

57:36.040 --> 57:37.880
So on the client and on the server.

57:37.880 --> 57:39.800
And then it's sending compressed updates

57:39.800 --> 57:41.280
between the two proxies.

57:41.280 --> 57:43.520
And so X is getting immediate response

57:43.520 --> 57:44.680
from these two proxies.

57:44.680 --> 57:47.920
And then they handle the transferring of all of that stuff

57:47.920 --> 57:49.680
in a much more efficient means.

57:49.680 --> 57:54.000
And by doing so, you only have to install a few extra X stuff

57:54.000 --> 57:54.840
to get X2GO working.

57:54.840 --> 57:57.560
You don't have to have a full X2GO graphical environment.

57:57.560 --> 58:00.720
And I'll have the commands you need to run

58:00.720 --> 58:02.320
to install that in the show notes.

58:02.320 --> 58:07.320
And I'll tell you what guys, it is pretty impressive.

58:08.040 --> 58:10.000
It is pretty impressive how fast you can get.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.760
Now there's just certain limitations I'll go into,

58:11.760 --> 58:14.080
but just as a base start,

58:14.080 --> 58:15.880
if you start with a desktop environment

58:15.880 --> 58:17.040
that is not composited,

58:17.040 --> 58:20.360
so like your Mates or an XFCE,

58:20.360 --> 58:23.240
so Gnome 3 and Unity 7 and Plasma Desktop,

58:23.240 --> 58:25.720
the latest versions are all kind of out

58:25.720 --> 58:28.000
unless you use software rendering.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.080
And there is a way to get it working

58:30.080 --> 58:33.000
with Gnome fallback mode to the classic mode,

58:33.000 --> 58:34.920
but I chose not to do that.

58:36.600 --> 58:39.200
So if you use like a 2D desktop basically,

58:39.200 --> 58:42.840
you get essentially damn near local performance

58:42.840 --> 58:44.600
on the LAN and scaling performance

58:44.600 --> 58:45.960
on your remote connection.

58:45.960 --> 58:49.840
I went with Mate and the main problem I've had so far

58:49.840 --> 58:54.400
is I will open up a resume session on different computers

58:54.400 --> 58:55.920
at different resolutions.

58:55.920 --> 58:59.080
And sometimes the system tray area of Mate

58:59.080 --> 59:01.000
just is really gummed up.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.040
Like all of my notification icons

59:03.040 --> 59:04.800
all be stacked on top of each other.

59:04.800 --> 59:06.280
Yeah, that seems like a tricky area.

59:06.280 --> 59:07.400
And here's what happened.

59:07.400 --> 59:09.600
So I set up Dropbox because I want to get

59:09.600 --> 59:11.640
all of my unfiltered clips on both systems

59:11.640 --> 59:14.440
so I can edit that stuff remotely.

59:14.440 --> 59:16.880
And I'll talk more about that in a second.

59:18.080 --> 59:19.720
So I set up my install Dropbox

59:19.720 --> 59:21.440
because I'm still using Dropbox for the unfiltered show

59:21.440 --> 59:23.400
because we have like a terabyte of data in there.

59:23.400 --> 59:24.840
It's a hard thing to move around.

59:24.840 --> 59:26.640
It's actually more than a terabyte of data.

59:26.640 --> 59:28.560
And so I started installs.

59:28.560 --> 59:30.280
And now the way Dropbox works on Linux

59:30.280 --> 59:32.160
is it starts syncing instantly.

59:32.160 --> 59:34.600
Starts just immediately as soon as you connect

59:34.600 --> 59:35.960
to your Dropbox account.

59:35.960 --> 59:38.120
And I go in there and I use selective syncs.

59:38.120 --> 59:40.680
That way I only pull down about like 10, 15 gigs

59:40.680 --> 59:43.240
of the over a terabyte of data.

59:43.240 --> 59:45.120
But because all of these icons in the system tray

59:45.120 --> 59:49.840
all stacked all over each other in some weird crappy bug

59:49.840 --> 59:51.640
after the screen size had changed,

59:51.640 --> 59:53.200
I kept right clicking on the system tray

59:53.200 --> 59:55.280
and getting everything but the Dropbox icon.

59:55.280 --> 59:57.440
Well, this is on a DigitalOcean droplet.

59:57.440 --> 59:59.440
And this thing's pulling down my Dropbox

59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.680
at just maddening speeds.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.520
It's filling the disk at just an unbelievable rate.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.640
And I'm like, I-

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.520
Just load testing Dropbox for them.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.040
Yeah, I was like, I got no option

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.680
because I can't get to this icon

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.880
to go into selective sync mode because of this.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.480
So I had to kill the entire desktop session

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.760
and log back in.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.720
So that way the system tray bar little area,

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.720
notification applet area would get redrawn.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.320
You're saying Dropbox needs a text-based config file.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.560
Well, it needs some sort of like-

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.400
No, I'm just trolling.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.360
It does have a command line actually,

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.360
but it needs some way to talk to the GUI version

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.680
from the command line.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.280
And then once I logged back in,

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.960
redrew the system tray area,

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.440
I was able to solve the problem.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:39.440
But quite a bit of gigabytes have been downloaded by then.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.380
Where I feel like maybe XFCE wouldn't have had

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:43.040
that problem, perhaps.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.440
You're probably right about that.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.440
So I'm just gonna play with that,

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.520
but I have Monte on both of them right now.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.520
Bashful, you wanted to jump in about compositing desktops.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.840
I would love to talk about that for a second

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.920
because that would, oh, I would love to get

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.920
like a Gnome 3 remote desktop session if that's possible.

01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.280
Well, so just to give a little history,

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.320
with my day job, we work in this exact space

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.760
except more on the performance side,

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.720
like leveraging GPUs and such for a bunch of our clients

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.760
like Pixar and all those guys.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.680
So a lot of them, even with the performance stuff,

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.040
they still traditionally go without compositing.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.160
So while you can get the performance for CAD

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.920
and video editing and even like video streaming

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.400
and so on and so forth, a lot of the desktop stuff

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.680
people still tend to disable.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.900
Okay, and that was sort of what I kind of come to

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:32.300
is in my rig that I have here on the land of the studio,

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.480
where I can get to the OBS files

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.760
and I can talk to all the other machines on the network,

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.600
that's the machine I have the GTX 960 in,

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.520
where if I need to do some sort of GPU job,

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.880
that would be the remote desktop.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.800
So here's my setup, tell me what you guys think.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.800
I got the two rigs, I've got orbital and suborbital.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.340
Orbital is a system up at DigitalOcean

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:54.220
and its key strengths are insane bandwidth,

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.160
it's just incredible bandwidth performance

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.080
and essentially unlimited disk,

01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.480
I just gotta throw money at the problem

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.640
and very, very, very fast disk, as well as snapshots,

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.600
so it's a good system to take risks on.

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.420
So that's my orbital system.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:07.920
And then you could probably, if you needed to,

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.760
you could destroy it and rebuild it,

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.400
let's say you were hanging out in Singapore

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.200
and you wanted it local there.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.200
Or move it.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.280
So that's orbital, and then I have suborbital,

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.860
which is here in the studio and it's primary,

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.880
it's the same, I'm trying to match the interfaces

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.800
as much as possible.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:25.960
And suborbital's main advantages are local GPU

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.920
with 960 with the NVIDIA proprietary driver,

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.360
a fair amount of local storage, but not too much,

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.360
not nearly what I have in the drop.

01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:36.280
And then, of course, the gigabit local access

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.240
to all the studio resources.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.640
And for me, it is sort of like,

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.920
it's sort of great, because if I have

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.480
a network-intensive job, I log into one system,

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.920
and if I have a compute-intensive job,

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.920
I can log into the other system.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.040
And I'm kind of playing with the idea

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.360
of trying to figure out all the ways

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.360
I could sync more of the settings

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.200
to make sure if I change something in one system,

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.160
it synchronizes to the other system.

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:00.020
I'd really like to start looking into that now.

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:00.860
But again, I've really got to-

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.280
We're just right back to configuration management,

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.120
aren't we, on this episode?

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.720
I guess so, oh boy, it really is.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.600
But then I've really got to nail down

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:06.560
that desktop environment.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:07.400
Yes.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.720
What do you think, Bashul?

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.900
You say Mate is the winner, Mate?

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.040
Yeah, it is, kind of by far, too.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.840
I was running it for quite a while at work here,

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.360
and out of all the desktops, it was the only one

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.240
that was decent if you wanted a full-blown desktop,

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:28.240
versus going with like a pilot manager.

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.440
Did you try XFCE?

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.440
At the, let me think about this, all right?

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.320
You know what, I'm not gonna say yay or nay on that.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.440
Now you got me thinking, I might go load one

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.280
just to test on-

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.120
I'd be curious, I'd be curious.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.840
The thing that really blows me away about X to go,

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.080
if you're putting it on Ubuntu or Arch,

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.440
actually it's in Solus too, but if you're doing it

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.440
on Ubuntu, it's you add a PPA, and you do all the dance

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.640
you have to do to update your sources list.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.720
But then it's just, it's really, you just need two packages

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.040
if you already have two packages.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.520
Two packages, if you already have Monte installed,

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.400
or whatever desktop environment you want.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.320
You just have to apt-get install X to go server,

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.800
and X to go server dash X session.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.240
Not all of Xorg, like it'll pull in its dependencies

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.000
that it needs, but you don't have to pull,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.880
it is really simple to create a system on a VPS,

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:18.360
like DigitalOcean or any other one,

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.280
and install these couple of packages,

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.280
and then you remote into it, and you're the display,

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.760
you don't need a display attached.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.680
Because the way X to go works is it has,

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.080
sort of like if you're familiar with Citrix

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.760
and other remote desktop clients,

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.560
it has a client manager, a session manager,

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.440
where you can have multiple servers listed there,

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:36.560
and you can set different settings,

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.560
and different compression settings

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:38.660
for the different servers.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:40.160
You can set up your shared folders.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.420
It's all done with a graphical interface.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.480
It's all in the GUI.

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.400
It's so straightforward.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.360
In fact, I'll give you a little demo.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.240
Because it's not perfect, it's definitely not perfect,

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.260
but it's pretty powerful, and I would definitely

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.960
trade the power for perfection in this particular case.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.100
And all of this stuff is really sort of,

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:03.160
kind of basic, like if you just leave the defaults,

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.840
you're gonna generally be okay.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.440
Let's take a moment to thank Linux Academy,

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.800
because honestly, if any of this stuff

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.880
sounds interesting to you, you could dive in even deeper

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.040
over at Linux Academy, so this would be

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.040
a good moment to do this.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.960
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:19.280
Go there to sign up and get a free seven-day trial.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.440
They have self-paced, in-depth video courses,

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.560
hands-on, scenario-based labs that really help it stick

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.400
and instructor mentoring by real human beings

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.120
when you get stuck and need some help.

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.980
And course scouts are when you're busy,

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.880
comprehensive study guides you can download

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.080
and take with you, and audio nuggets

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.840
that are sparkly bits of wisdom that you can deep dive into,

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.800
and a community that's full of clones of Westpain.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.200
It's kind of weird, actually.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.640
Yeah, we get along great, it's awesome.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.480
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.060
They also have iOS and Android apps,

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:52.200
and flashcards that get forked.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.120
It's a pretty great platform, really.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:58.320
If you think about it, it's something that would be like,

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.400
if you could just take all of Linux Academy

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.400
and go back in time and give it to yourself

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.880
like eight, 10 years, you'd be like Biff

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.480
bringing back the playbook.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.000
You could get so ahead of everybody.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.940
It's one of our precious resources.

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.580
We should launch it up and encapsulate it in a satellite

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.080
for future humanity.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:17.920
That's how important it is.

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:19.600
Or for aliens, they need it, too.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:20.440
That's true.

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.560
I mean, Linux is gonna be the kernel

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.200
that takes over their world once they learn about it.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.560
The GPL is a viral license.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.680
Yeah, exactly, we all know.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.800
So go get hedged now.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:28.640
It's kind of wild.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.600
I have to say, you're motivated, right?

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.440
You wanna learn Linux.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.260
You're listening to this show.

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.220
Obviously, you're interested in these topics.

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:37.560
But when you have a job and a family,

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.800
and you have the end of the day and you're tired,

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.800
there's a million reasons that you can come up with

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.840
not to learn something.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:43.680
Go girl.

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.160
But Linux Academy breaks down

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.760
every single possible barrier.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:48.720
They can't actually make you type things

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:51.000
and do the learning, but everything else

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.120
is set up right for you.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.320
It's so true. It's awesome.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:55.360
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.360
Big thank you to them for sponsoring the unplugged program.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.400
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.120
is where you get a free seven day trial,

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.160
and you support this here shenanigans.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.480
So I am in the process of reinstalling

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.920
a bunch of packages on Solace.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.760
Oh, you know what?

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.200
It launched just fine.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.520
Isn't that wonderful?

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.000
So you have the X2Go client session manager.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.400
Were you gonna say something, Beard?

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.720
I was just gonna ask, have you tested out X2Go at all

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.920
on a more flaky connection?

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:25.400
Well, on a MiFi, which is pretty, pretty crap.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.240
Pretty, pretty crap.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.400
What kind of bandwidth do you get on that thing?

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.880
It ranges depending on the day.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.160
So it depends on which connection I'm on.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:36.560
So if I'm on a TIN connection, or an AT&T connection,

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.600
or a public Wi-Fi connection,

01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:41.000
because I sort of use all of them.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.240
Listen to user error back catalogs for more information

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.580
where I've outlined it all.

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:48.160
And in there, I have a large variance.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:53.160
And I can get up to maybe seven megabits

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.640
where I'm usually at, and I can get as low as easily

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.440
as low as 400 kilobits a second.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.720
I mean, it can be a pretty dramatic range

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.560
depending on how much bandwidth I've used,

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.840
how loaded the network is, and all of those things.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:09.320
So I have tested this from everything from gigabit

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:12.400
to probably around 500K a second.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.240
And so maybe that's a good place to start.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.640
We could take a look at this.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:20.640
So in X2GO, you have the client session manager.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.400
And I have two connections up right now.

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:26.080
And let's take a look here at the sub-orbital one.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.840
This is the one here on the LAN.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:30.200
So this could be an example of how you would maybe do this.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.560
So I can disconnect my session, I can pause it right here.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.800
So I'm suspending a session I already have open,

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.200
which is always a lot of fun.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.640
And then I can go in and I can edit that session.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.560
And I have my different options I can choose from.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.720
And in here, you can see the host,

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.320
the username I want it to use by default,

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:46.160
and the port.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.840
So if you're maybe forwarding a random ass port to 22,

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.240
you could override that and put in here.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.800
You can, with a dropdown option,

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.320
you can choose the desktop environment

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.000
that you're gonna be logging into.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.480
So they have MATE right here in the dropdown already.

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:01.560
They also have Unity, Cinnamon, Trinity,

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:05.440
XD, MCP, connecting to a local desktop,

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:09.720
and notably, support for connecting to an RDP server,

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.040
a Windows terminal server.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:11.920
Oh, is that right?

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:12.760
Mm-hmm.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:13.720
But here's the really interesting stuff.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.320
So on the Connection tab,

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.240
this is where you have your connection speed preferences.

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:21.120
And because I'm on a LAN, I have a slider.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:22.080
So that's that baby.

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.600
Yeah, it goes everywhere from modem to LAN.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.360
And this change is not only compression,

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.360
but what the size of the packets that get sent.

01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:33.240
And so when you're on a MiFi, you go to modem,

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.900
and here on LAN, I can go to LAN.

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:38.080
But then they have a million different compression options.

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.000
This is something I spent some time playing with

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.520
because they have, you can do no compression,

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.960
you can do adaptive compression,

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:49.400
but you can also say lock it in at 16 meg JPEG,

01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.960
or lock it in at 24k PNG.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.280
So you can choose different image compression

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.960
depending on if your preference is speed or image quality.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.040
And I have found that the 16 meg JPEG

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.200
has been pretty good for me.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:04.940
They also even have some RDP compression,

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.520
which all works pretty well.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:09.280
And then they have your input and output for the size of it,

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.440
the DPI, so if you're on a high DPI screen,

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.680
you can pass that along to X2GO.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.840
So it does support high DPI,

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.120
but you have to manually enter that in here.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.800
Then you have your sound options,

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:22.280
so I can have it redirect sound to my local Pulse audio.

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.720
You can use SSH port forwarding

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.040
to tunnel the sound system connections through firewall,

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.840
so you do not have to open up a separate port.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.560
And then on the shared media tab,

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.480
in here is where you can add your local files,

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.740
and it will use SFTP to actually transfer those files.

01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:39.440
So now here, I'll show you what it's like to log in.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.480
So I'm logging into the one here on my LAN.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:44.940
In the background, I have, let me minimize that guy.

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:45.780
In the background here,

01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.000
this is the system up on DigitalOcean right here.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.520
And you can actually start to see the problem right here

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.340
in the system tray with this double volume icon thing

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:54.180
that's going on.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:55.000
Oh yeah, I haven't seen that before.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.040
Mm-hmm, that's due to me changing the resolutions.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:01.960
But to Mate's credit, if I resize this X2GO window here,

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.900
Mate will snap pretty well to that, boom,

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:05.560
and it resizes pretty dynamically.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.440
So to its credit, I can't sit here,

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.520
and I can screw around with the window size proportions,

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.560
and Mate actually handles it pretty good.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.800
It's just sometimes those notification icons

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.640
lose their crap.

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.460
Yeah.

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:18.700
But before I log into the local LAN system,

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:20.440
while I have it up on the screen,

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.680
here is the system that I have up on DigitalOcean.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.040
I call this one Orbital.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:24.940
I'll try to get it on the screen.

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:25.780
And I just thought maybe,

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.260
if you're watching the video version,

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:28.800
I'd show you what the performance is like.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:29.840
Yeah, walk us around a bit.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.560
So let's open up, here's my file manager,

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:34.980
and you can see, when I maximize the window,

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.520
you can see there's a, it's pretty good.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.040
There's a real slight delay, but it's pretty usable.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.520
Here's me dragging the window around.

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:43.000
Again, maybe not quite as smooth as,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:43.960
if I was running locally,

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.840
I'd also be using Compass to them.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.640
But in terms of latency, when I type in terminal,

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.620
it's right on the money for me.

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:54.160
There's no delay there, right?

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.440
It pops up on the window.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.440
I can start typing immediately.

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.800
When I hit enter on commands,

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.400
they'll show up instantaneously on screen.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.440
There's really, there's no delay here

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.920
which would prevent me from working.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.880
Let's try browsing the web.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.040
This is usually the most challenging, actually,

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.320
is this browsing the web thing,

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.160
because it involves redrawing.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.480
You've even got it signed into your account,

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:16.320
and look at this, that's great.

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.880
Oh yeah, it's ready to go for me.

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:19.720
Oh yeah, it's ready to go at all the times.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:21.480
This is actually probably the best test.

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:24.360
Scrolling a complicated web page.

01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.640
This web page is Twitter,

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.320
it has video playing on it right now,

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.680
and you can see there's some sort of herky-jerky

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:32.000
as it reloads, and there's a little bit of delay,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.680
like when I stop, it keeps going

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:35.240
for just a brief moment.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.080
We could...

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.920
And the remote server, we have to keep in mind,

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.640
doesn't have any sort of GPU even integrated

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.520
to help with the fancy rendering.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.880
Right, exactly, totally.

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.960
So now let's compare that to,

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.480
here, I'll log into my local system.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.800
Now this is with my compression settings

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.320
basically saying, let's have at it.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.480
You're on a LAN connection, so let's just go nuts.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.680
And so this will kind of be a good comparison

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.800
if you have a pretty fast connection.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.400
So that's a slower connection, what we just showed you.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.440
It's usable, it's very usable.

01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:06.560
There's just some herky-jerky when you're scrolling

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.640
or dragging windows, but it's definitely usable.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.120
And if you're working in a terminal,

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.960
you're working in a text editor,

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:14.160
you're browsing web, you're chatting Telegram,

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.040
all these things, Slack, all work just fine

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.600
in that slower connection.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.660
But now let's take a look at the LAN speeds,

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:23.480
where I feel like it really shines.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.580
Let's go back, we'll do the Twitter test here again.

01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.880
We'll make it nice and big so that way it's the same size.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.280
We start doing the scrolling much smoother.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.680
And it's right on point with me too.

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:34.520
There's no latency.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.320
When I stop scrolling, it scrolls.

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.240
This, you, if I didn't tell you this is a remote session,

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.640
I don't think you would be able to tell on your own.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.880
I think you could legitimately sit down at this computer

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:50.240
and not suspect this is a remote session.

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.480
It is that performant over the LAN.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.140
This is key for me because that means

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.600
I can sit down at any of these systems

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:59.120
and have a really great, really well-performing experience.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:01.480
So much so that, check this out.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.400
We'll go into the unfilter archive here

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.080
and we can play a little cyber news.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.800
And the video actually plays.

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.600
Are we gonna get full cyber here?

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.520
This is their audio too.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.880
This is from the remote session.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:14.280
Is now putting nearly all of them at risk.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.120
Wow.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.440
A bug known as crack.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.280
No, not crack.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.920
Fundamental flaw in the technology.

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.680
And that is live from my remote session,

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.280
video and audio, and they're synced up.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.280
It's playable.

01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:27.160
I mean, it's damn impressive.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.960
And this is a headless Ubuntu box.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:30.800
That's awesome.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.680
Out in the garage right now.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.880
Side note, it's really fun to watch mainstream media

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.320
try to cover things like that.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.160
Crack.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.800
Yeah, they are the worst at that, aren't they?

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.000
So you can see there's a,

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.440
so let's go just as a comparison note now.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.840
Let's go try to play that same video on the remote session.

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:47.540
Cause again, I have these things pretty synced up.

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:49.780
So I have sort of the same stuff on both systems.

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:52.520
So we go play the same clip now on the remote session.

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:53.720
Let's see how that works.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:55.920
Well, a security feature.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.240
Ooh, much herkier jerkier.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.440
Barely, not watchable.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.440
The audio is staying current though.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.600
That's impressive.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.600
Audio is staying current,

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:08.240
but it is a disastrous slideshow.

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.000
That could be because there's,

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.460
I doubt if that's a GPU thing.

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.280
I think that's just a compression thing.

01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.460
I'm pretty sure that's just compression.

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:18.880
But it is such a game changer for me.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:19.700
That's awesome.

01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:21.280
Because it's still usable even over the MiFi.

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.460
It's still completely usable.

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:24.720
And I'm able to do bandwidth intensive things

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:25.920
in the remote session.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.920
And then when it's time for me to come into the studio,

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:30.720
I close the window and I sit back down at the system here

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.280
and I reopen the window.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.920
And if I'm working off of suborbital,

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.720
it's just super fast.

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:37.700
But if I'm working off of the remote system,

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.560
everything's the same, nothing's changed.

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:42.880
And it performs great here on the connection for the studio.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.400
So X2GO is definitely worth a look.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.960
It's still very, very relevant.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.680
I don't know what its future is in a Wayland universe,

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.800
but to be honest, I'm not as concerned about that yet.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.640
You'll get there.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:53.480
I don't think the production systems

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:55.640
are going to Wayland in the next year or so.

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.720
So that's a problem for future, Chris,

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.160
in about two years, maybe.

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.760
Unless that GNOME Wayland session doesn't crash so much.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.560
Or if Pipewire comes up with some really

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.360
badass remote system.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.380
If anybody knows a way that's even more

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:10.000
performed than X2GO, I absolutely would try it.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.960
Because video editing's still a little herky-jerky for me.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.040
I know that's a very high bar, but boy,

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.240
wouldn't that be a treat.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.320
In the past, I've used XPRA, or it's also

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.160
part of the WinSwitch project.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.460
I know WinSwitch supports multiple operating systems.

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:25.920
I don't know how X2GO.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.840
And if you look online, if you search

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.440
for a comparison between the two,

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:32.080
you'll almost exclusively find Hacker News posts,

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.840
Reddit posts asking for a comparison,

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:35.280
and then no further comments.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.200
So it's a little bit different, and I

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.240
haven't used both of them.

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.140
But maybe XPRA is something you could try and just compare.

01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:42.600
In the past, I'd been running OBS on a droplet,

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.520
and I'd been using that to control the stream,

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.840
and that was working pretty nicely.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.000
I did not do any intensive editing, necessarily,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.080
so I can't speak to that.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.540
I'm not talking intensive editing.

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.480
I'm talking like Avid Mux, clip off the end,

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.320
clip off the beginning, grab 30 seconds of a clip,

01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:00.040
very basic mark in out, mark the in, mark the out, export.

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.840
So it might be worth just throwing that on that same droplet

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:05.120
and just connecting up and seeing what the experience is like.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.800
Will you toss a link to that in the show notes section?

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:07.280
I sure will.

01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:08.360
I would love to take a look at that.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:11.240
I mean, you were suggesting a couple other things, too.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:11.740
Go ahead.

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.040
I know you want to say something, seriously.

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:17.320
You had suggested Splashtop, which

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.520
could work because it basically encapsulates

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:20.600
the entire desktop.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:21.880
Yeah, it's basically just a video stream.

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:25.280
It's an H.264 stream, yeah, that then takes your inputs

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.160
and outputs and forwards them.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:30.000
Kind of sounds like a water park ride, but that's just a perk,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:30.600
I guess.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.800
Splashtop might also be a good solution,

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.840
but the thing I really like about X2GO

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:40.120
is there's no session running at the physical machine.

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:43.200
These are sessions that run headless

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.280
that I can pop in and pop out of,

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.600
and I could still go hook up a monitor, mouse, keyboard

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.880
to that machine and log in at the desktop, I suppose,

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.960
if I wanted to, at least on the local one.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:53.000
Really cool.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.080
There are ways to connect to the local desktop, too,

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:58.680
so there is ways to connect to the running session.

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.720
That's not what I'm using it for.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.800
Does anybody have any input in the Discord

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.640
there on this particular topic or how they do remote desktop

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.780
for Linux?

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:10.080
And I am specifically going for remote desktop, not just SSH,

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.840
because this is using SSH, actually.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.720
I have that as an option, too, now, obviously.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:14.960
Right, but you need the graphical thing.

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.600
You already have a solution for remote terminals.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.440
We figured that out like 10 years ago.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.360
You know what works?

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.240
If you do, by the way, in the Discord room,

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.160
just toss a hand in the chat.

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:26.640
You know what works super well for me

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:30.760
is having a basic-bitch terminal that I'm sitting at that

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:35.080
has a couple of X terminals or something,

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.440
like whatever, that I can SSH into these boxes

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.040
that I'm X2going into.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:43.320
So then I have a graphical interface,

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:46.640
and in the background, I have an SSH terminal command line

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.580
into that box.

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.960
And if anything gets weird in my graphical environment,

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.480
I am one second away, less than a second away,

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.200
from tabbing over to that terminal

01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.480
and killing a process or fixing the issue.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.840
It's like I have a backdoor into the main system

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.680
I'm always working on in a way that gives me

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.880
this really supreme confidence that I'm

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:04.920
going to be able to handle anything that

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.340
happens in that graphical session,

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:08.800
because I've got this emergency persistent backdoor.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.300
And because both these systems, like the one on Digital Ocean

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:14.560
on the LAN, are so rock solid, my SSH session

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.680
has been running to both these systems now

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:19.640
on one of my boxes for like six days without being broken.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:22.960
So the terminal is always there, always connected in.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.880
It's always just a couple of commands away.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.520
That's great.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.000
It is.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.080
It's just a cool way to work.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:27.760
I really like it.

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.160
Bashful, you had a comment on GPU.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:29.640
Go for it.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.680
I'd love to hear about that.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.680
I'm just curious out of a bunch of the stuff

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.180
that you've done research on, have you

01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:37.840
found anything that actually leverages the GPU?

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.360
Well, I think Splashtop would, because it

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.840
might be when it's encoding.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:46.960
For me, I don't need my desktop session to be composited.

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:49.640
What I need the GPU for is encoding video,

01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.240
or potentially maybe running OBS,

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.520
which maybe that's where I'd run into this problem.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:57.760
Because I do want to experiment with that as well.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.740
So I could see some workloads in the future

01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:01.260
where it'd be a problem.

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:04.640
Yeah, I know a couple of the big three

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:09.160
are looking towards GPU workloads with remote desktop.

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.560
But I'm wondering on the pricing behind it.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:14.440
There's already things that can leverage it both for the desktop

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:17.280
session and so on and so forth, but it's pretty damn pricey.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.760
I could see for my orbital system,

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:21.680
the one that I call it orbital because it's out in the cloud,

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.580
I could see moving that to say if Amazon or somebody came

01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:28.720
around or your rack space or an Azure came around and said,

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:30.600
we can do hosted Linux desktop.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.440
And it'll have a GPU, and you can connect to it

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:37.160
from any operating system, and it's $25 a month.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.700
I may give it a serious consideration

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.920
because this is a legitimate work tool for me.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.100
But it's going to be impossible for any of them

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:46.120
to compete with suborbital, the system I have on the LAN,

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:50.400
because that's got gigabit access to my OBS recording.

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.680
It's got gigabit access to all the other machines.

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.800
It's got physical hardware that I can come in

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.000
and I can plug into it and then get access to.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.880
So maybe I want to one day plug in an SD card reader to it

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:03.040
or something, weird stuff like that that I could never

01:21:03.040 --> 01:21:04.120
get in a hosted system.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:07.440
So to me, having these two boxes is the invaluable part

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:09.460
because the orbital system is totally

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:10.560
independent of the studio.

01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:13.480
If the studio goes offline or I'm in some weird place

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.320
and it's way faster for me to connect to that,

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.560
I've always got that.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.560
But I can't ever see replacing suborbital

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:23.480
because that's unique because it's here on the LAN.

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.480
I think the GPU instances are probably, at least not

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.120
in the short term, never going to come in at like $25 a pop.

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:30.640
If you just look at what it costs

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:34.520
to go and rent one on Google Compute or Amazon or whatever,

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.440
they're significantly more expensive.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.720
And that's not even running them full time.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.960
Well, I'm grateful that Mate works as well as it does,

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.720
actually, really.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.440
When I look at how I can resize these windows

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.640
and just sort of abuse it and it just sort of snaps back

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.680
for the most part, I'm pretty grateful for that.

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:53.840
And I'm really grateful that it has, I have put it,

01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:56.120
I took the Redmond layout and I've modified the Redmond

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:58.160
layout, which puts essentially everything

01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.640
in one bar at the bottom.

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.160
So you have your task switcher, your launchers,

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:02.960
your system tray.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.840
I'm not doing any docs or anything like that.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.600
I just have like some quick launch icons.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.120
And then I've got one of the Mate launchers here.

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:12.720
I don't think it's Brisk, but maybe, oh yeah, it is Brisk.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:15.320
Yeah, in fact, I replaced the one it had for the Redmond

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.480
and I added Brisk.

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.880
And it's just so freaking functional.

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:21.960
It's just unbelievable.

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:26.600
Like I've got just, I could rave for two episodes

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.320
about how there is really something

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:29.800
to that just straightforward, practical,

01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:31.080
everything works as I expected.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.440
It's rock solid.

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:34.640
I mean, these systems have been running for days now

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.520
and I just pop in, pop out all the time

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:37.880
and they're always there ready to work

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.480
from whatever machine I'm connecting from.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:40.320
It's really great.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.520
And if you haven't played around with it,

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:43.400
the barrier to entry is super low.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:46.680
I'll have the commands you need to run

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:48.720
if you're on Ubuntu to install it.

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.200
It's really just a few packages.

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.920
It's also available on a lot of other distros.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.320
I really encourage you to play around with it,

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.200
even if you're just playing around on your LAN

01:22:55.200 --> 01:23:00.200
or you just want to get more use out of one

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.160
really powerful system in your house

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.520
because you can have multiple people logged in

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.360
at the same time.

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.600
Or even, I mean, like you can use it

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:07.040
for more traditional things too,

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.160
like supporting family members or others

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:10.640
if you have that installed.

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.760
If you have these instructions now,

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.880
just get it set up one time

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:14.880
and then when you need to jump on their box, there you go.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:17.480
But you could also, if money's tight,

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:20.200
you could get one really nice family system

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.160
and then just scrape together

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.680
and get a couple of dumb terminals that are.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:23.760
I was immediately thinking about that.

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:24.600
Yeah, right.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.440
Or Chromebook even.

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:28.600
Get some Chromebooks and then the Chromebooks run next to go

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.200
and they connect into it and the one central box

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:33.240
in your house has got the i7, it's got the GPU,

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.080
it's got the disk.

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.400
You can also then easily manage backups

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.600
and all kinds of stuff that way.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.060
Well, start thinking about how it changes

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.360
your media management too.

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:42.440
If I load MB on one of these things

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.540
and I start just doing my downloads

01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.100
and my media management on one of these things,

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:48.720
then all of a sudden life just gets a lot easier

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.100
because the MB server's running locally on the box,

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:52.700
the media files are all locally on the box,

01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:54.500
I can remote into it and have local access

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:55.800
or I can stream it over MB.

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:01.520
When you take a basically Linux

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.620
or when you put a desktop on it

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.380
is essentially what I've done.

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.500
There's actually surprisingly nice uses

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.100
for having a desktop on a server

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:10.080
if it's not hosting web pages

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.860
or performing traditional server roles.

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:14.840
If it's doing more like syncing your media,

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:16.840
maybe downloading files for you, things like that,

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.900
all of a sudden it's very useful.

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:19.740
I really like it.

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:22.680
And it's a solution that's not new to me.

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:24.800
I did something like this eight, nine years ago

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.520
when I worked at a school

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.700
that had very restrictive web filtering.

01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:30.760
I would remote into a physical box

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.040
that I had in a rack in a data center somewhere.

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:35.800
And I used No Machine back then, No Machine NX,

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.580
which is what this is based off of.

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:38.960
And it worked back then.

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.840
And it's sort of an old idea

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.460
and it just still really holds a lot of water,

01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:46.760
especially with 1710, Ubuntu MATE,

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.560
I'm not making any kind of compromise

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.480
in a modern desktop environment.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.580
And you, I mean, as we all know, Chris, you're somewhat picky

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:55.840
in terms of interactions, other things.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:57.960
So if this wasn't usable, you would be the first to say it.

01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.320
Oh, that's true, I would, yeah.

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:02.040
And I'm still like, you know, I may try XFCE

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.640
and if I could have a GPU accelerated composited desktop,

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:05.600
I might like that.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.440
Right, yeah.

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.560
I'll have to have one.

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.440
We'll get there.

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.680
Yeah, yeah, we'll get there.

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.160
In the meantime, it gives me the freedom

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:14.200
to sort of wreck havoc in the studio

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.880
and at least know I've got a couple of escape hatches

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.880
where all my stuff's already logged in, ready to go,

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.640
Telegram's right there, Slack's right there,

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.320
all my S, all my bookmarks, all my show notes.

01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.160
Can go on.

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.720
Mm-hmm, and that's really what it's all about.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:30.040
And it really, you know, gosh, it's just so low overhead.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.240
I love that about open source software.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.800
Yeah, I didn't have to go spend hundreds of dollars

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.440
to get some sort of remote desktop package.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:38.440
I didn't have to hassle with any of that.

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:40.600
Not to, you know, not to overstress that,

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:41.520
but that is just such a nice thing

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:42.720
when you all of a sudden get a wild hair

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.160
and you think, oh my gosh, I could solve this problem

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.680
I'm about to have with free software.

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:49.040
It really is empowering, it really is great.

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:50.760
And that's the message right there we want to end on.

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:54.120
But I'd love to hear what you do for remote desktop access,

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.400
especially if you've got one that performs super, super well.

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.200
Please, please let us know.

01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.560

That subreddit definitely could use some love.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.840
Okay, Wes, guess what?

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.040
It's time to end the show today.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.320
Yeah, yeah, Beardsley, how do you think

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.040
the Discord test went, pretty good?

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:12.880
Pretty good.

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.800
We're gonna be back on Mumble while we evaluate,

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.480

You've been commanded.

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:29.920
No excuses now.

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.360
There is no excuse.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.200
Make it happen.

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.600
Make it show, as Captain McQuarrie would say.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.360
Follow the network at Jupiter Signal.

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.120
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:40.360
and we'll see you back here next week

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.920
for episode 221.

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:43.760
Say goodbye guys.

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.600
Goodbye.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.440
Goodbye.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:46.800
Goodbye, Mama.

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.800
I

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.400
Think I got a little post show in me. Yeah

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:35.640
Some posters bashful's got some follow-up some real-time follow-up here. And then before Poby goes I have some FOMO stuff

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:37.640
I want to talk to him about but bashful

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.380
Yeah, I got it. I got it here. Which I got it. He's over there. He's over here

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:45.200
well, I got to be careful how much I say but

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:49.780
Long in the short of it is is that where I'm working right now?

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:56.180
We actually have an agent a different that runs over the PCIe protocol that can leverage the GPUs natively

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:02.120
For remote a whole want yep

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.660
Yeah, well it's it's kind of on its way

01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:17.480
Like our whole company runs remotely everything in our office is just either a laptop or what's called a zero client

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.460
Interesting and so there's no

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:27.040
So, I'm pretty sure it's fire when it comes you guys you guys are already hip to this notion

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.840
Yeah, we've been well

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:30.160
I mean

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:33.440
That's what the company work for it was founded on and stuff like that

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:40.000
And so for example Amazon workspaces their windows offering like that's our agent. Yeah, that's really hot guy and we actually

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.560
This kind of stuff doing remote desktop terminal services stuff. It's interesting. It's still now. It's just getting hosted by larger companies

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:52.320
Well, it's that and also a lot of people tend to look at it for now

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.720
I almost equate it to application streaming

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:59.120
So where a lot of our workloads are going is people bringing specific

01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:05.260
Applications over the net and it's a lot of like CAD and video editing and stuff like that. Basically everyone wants to leverage

01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:11.980
Remote resources and I was gonna I should have mentioned X to go also has support for publishing just a

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:18.900
Just a single app. But yeah, so poppy I have to ask what's tell me you you are I

01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:25.460
Believe you are preaching the Church of rust to everybody and I I feel like I'm totally left out

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:29.140
I'm not I know rust is a game. I know there's something that's not just a programming language

01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:31.820
but

01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:36.760
Chase someone right now. Is it so it's like a game. Is it like an open-world game?

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:39.820
Yeah, it's a blow

01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:42.420
Discord outed you that you were playing

01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:49.180
Yeah, I'm playing at the moment and and it obviously works under Linux and I take it poppy. Oh, yeah

01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:55.500
Can I ask how many penises you see in the past half hour? Penises

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.340
That's pretty personal there. They're

01:29:58.100 --> 01:30:02.180
Russ is notorious for having a lot of male genitalia

01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:07.620
Swinging around. So is it like a is it like co-op environment? Is it self-hosted servers?

01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:12.980
What is the is it a multiplayer at all poppy? Is it single-player? Yeah. Yeah, it's totally multiplayer

01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:19.740
So it's a big open-world think minecraft but with the yeah, no wonder it's so big exactly

01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:22.460
It's it's hilarious

01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:27.180
Sorry, I I'm playing it right now while we're talking and

01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:37.020
So the premise is you arrive naked on an island and you have to run around and gather resources and

01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:45.860
Fortify your base because other people will come along and kill you. Oh, no, we'll kill you. So, how do you know like

01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:49.380
How do you know you can't you can you build your own server?

01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:53.700
Like can you run your own system? So you could just have your own world where people won't kill you. Yeah

01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:58.340
Yeah, you could do totally do that. I'm running on there. I'm I play mostly on the gaming on the next

01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:03.420
Server so Liam the guy. Yeah. Yep. I saw him tweeting about it. Yeah

01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:10.100
Yeah, he has his own server and we play on there, but there are other servers that are modded

01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:12.100
there are some that are stock and some that are

01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:18.980
Tweaked to be you know better faster different in some ways it hostile. Is it fun? Like is it?

01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:23.100
Oh, it's it's generally shoot on sight. So if you see some

01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:28.740
Naked person running in front of you you shoot them first and then run up to their body and steal their stuff

01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:32.740
And if they turn out to be your friend, then you revive them

01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:36.540
But it's generally shoot on sight. It's survival like just now

01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:45.220
yeah, just now when you were talking to be an aeroplane flew over and did an airdrop in air drops you on you find automatic weapons and

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:47.220
All kinds of other useful

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:51.340
So if I join do I have any shot of making it before getting murdered at this point?

01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:57.500
Is there just too many people? So the interesting thing is the servers reset every month because it's currently an alpha

01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:03.940
any server you join pretty much any of this the stock servers will wipe and

01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:10.700
So if you join soon after the wipe you're in with a bit of a chance if you joined

01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:12.860
now

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:16.500
Like a few days or a week before the server wipes

01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:20.700
Then chances are everyone else has automatic weapons and you arrive as a naked

01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:28.220
And the interesting thing about these kind of games and I believe rust is one of them is if you log off your body stays

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:31.660
In the world so you can go and find somebody that's like laying around just steal their stuff

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:39.740
Yes, so this is why you fortify your your place and you build a house in which you're protected

01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:44.020
So when you exit the game your body is left in a place where nobody can get you

01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:50.020
But people could build c4 and explode the walls bust through wall steal your stuff

01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:52.020
so yeah, so um

01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:57.900
So that must be like some sort of mad rush for resources and territory when the server is actually yeah

01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:02.180
Yeah, that sounds really stressful and then just a constant war until the reset

01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:05.160
But it also sounds really fun. If I was good at it, it would be fun

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:08.100
But until I was hilarious, you don't even have to be good

01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:15.140
I I have I have shared some space with wimpy me and him have a little compound

01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:21.740
It's adorable have high high walls around it with an automatic door and automatic turrets

01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:25.140
So if anyone busted through the door, they get shot as soon as they come through the door

01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:32.360
And all kinds of other like ways in which to protect our stuff. It's the alliance all ephemeral anyway

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:33.820
Yeah, it sounds fun though

01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:39.340
Cuz it's in a week in a week or so this is all gonna get thrown away and we all start again as nakeds on

01:33:39.340 --> 01:33:44.020
The beach so yeah, it's good fun. Yes. There's really kind of profound in a lot of ways actually

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:50.180
Yeah, is what it is. It's like a society if what would happen if society completely collapsed. This is what we'd have

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:57.400
Yeah, that's the weird thing. We have we've built up knowing that they're so when you know that the server wipe is coming

01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:03.040
When it gets close to the server wipe nobody cares about anything because you know

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:14.580
You're all gonna get wiped out in a week. So everyone just goes attacking everyone even people you had as friends

01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:17.300
Oh, what does this say about humanity? What does this say?

01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:23.940
you start building up a stockpile of food and weapons and armor and clothes and

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:31.620
You know the resources you need to survive the apocalypse. It's brilliant. That's pretty great. All right. I just bought it on humble bundle

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:36.380
I'm gonna give it a go. I gotta try it. I gotta try it. Okay server. What do you guys say?

01:34:36.380 --> 01:35:01.300
