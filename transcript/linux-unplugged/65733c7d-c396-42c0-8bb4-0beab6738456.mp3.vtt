WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
I read email, I write email, I do no coding at all anymore.

00:06.400 --> 00:10.800
Most of the code I write, I actually write inside my mail reader.

00:10.800 --> 00:15.200
So somebody sends me a patch, or more commonly, they send me a pull request,

00:15.200 --> 00:19.040
or there's a discussion about the next pull request,

00:19.040 --> 00:22.240
and there's something I react to and say,

00:22.240 --> 00:29.920
no, this is fine, but, and I send out pseudocode,

00:29.920 --> 00:33.440
or I'm so used to editing patches that I sometimes edit patches,

00:33.440 --> 00:38.720
I send out the patch without having ever compiled it, ever tested it,

00:38.720 --> 00:41.920
because I literally wrote it in the mail reader,

00:41.920 --> 00:44.400
and saying, I think this is how it should be done.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.600
But this is what I do.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.720
I'm not a programmer anymore.

00:48.720 --> 00:53.840
I read a lot more email than I write,

00:53.840 --> 01:00.800
because what my job really is, in the end, my job is to say no.

01:00.800 --> 01:05.440
Somebody has to be able to say no to people,

01:05.440 --> 01:11.440
and because other developers know that if they do something bad,

01:11.440 --> 01:17.840
I will say no, they hopefully in turn are more careful.

01:17.840 --> 01:23.440
But in order to be able to say no, I have to know the background,

01:23.440 --> 01:29.040
because otherwise my no is, I can't do my job.

01:29.040 --> 01:34.960
So I spend all my time basically reading email about what people are working on.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.280
Well, that just leaves us one burning question.

01:37.280 --> 01:49.680
Which email client?

01:49.680 --> 01:52.560
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.440
My name is Chris.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.400
My name is Wes.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.520
Hello, Wes.

01:55.520 --> 01:58.240
This episode is inspired by our email.

01:58.240 --> 02:01.040
We have read emails, tweets, and telegrams,

02:01.040 --> 02:03.600
and we'll be doing a whole batch of follow-up on topics

02:03.600 --> 02:04.960
we've talked about before on the show,

02:04.960 --> 02:07.600
and give you an update on how they're doing.

02:07.600 --> 02:12.640
Plus, we'll dig into some, well, not exactly community news,

02:12.640 --> 02:13.760
but similar community news,

02:13.760 --> 02:16.640
and we'll play a few more Linux clips from a recent talk he was at.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.440
We have a bunch of good stuff, but before we can really do any of that,

02:19.440 --> 02:22.160
we have a little bit of upfront work that has to be done.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.160
I got to say hello to Drew and Cheese.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.920
Gentlemen, welcome into the show.

02:25.920 --> 02:26.640
Howdy.

02:26.640 --> 02:27.440
Hello.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.720
Thank you for joining Wes and I.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.280
What do you say we give a holler to that virtual lug too?

02:31.280 --> 02:32.720
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.440
Hello.

02:33.440 --> 02:34.320
Hello, hello.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.680
Hello.

02:35.680 --> 02:36.320
Hello.

02:36.320 --> 02:40.400
We are sneaky recording ahead this week.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.880
So if anything major has happened

02:42.880 --> 02:45.600
that you think it's a little strange we haven't talked about,

02:46.320 --> 02:48.640
that's because we're doing a little pre-record

02:48.640 --> 02:52.320
while I'm taking a family trip in Bozeman, Montana right now.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.000
But don't worry, we'll pick it up next week.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.320
We're just not as clairvoyant as we used to be, you know?

02:56.320 --> 02:58.640
You know, I should have looked at that crystal ball before we started,

02:58.640 --> 02:59.840
but I just keep forgetting it.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.240
Put it in the cupboard and I never go in there anymore

03:02.240 --> 03:04.880
because I need a crystal ball to tell me to go get the crystal ball.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.440
I was in Texas, now I'm on a trip to Montana,

03:07.440 --> 03:09.280
and then I'll be on a trip back to the studio.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.480
So it's all said and done.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.200
I think it's like 40, 45 days on the road.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.200
It's been a crazy, crazy couple of weeks

03:15.200 --> 03:18.960
or many weeks now on the road, but it's almost over.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.360
And so we thought we'd do one more record ahead.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.400
Most of them have been live,

03:22.400 --> 03:23.920
but we thought we'd do one more record ahead

03:23.920 --> 03:26.400
so that way I could go do some swimming with the family.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.840
I was enjoying this Linus keynote.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.480
He had a conversation with Dirk Handel, who is

03:33.600 --> 03:37.120
the VP and Chief Open Source Officer at VMware.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.600
It's about a 26-minute talk,

03:39.600 --> 03:42.480
and I have the whole thing linked in the old show notes

03:42.480 --> 03:45.120
if you'd like to listen to the entire thing.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.640
But I grabbed two other bits about it that I thought were a little fascinating

03:48.640 --> 03:50.400
that maybe we could play and talk about.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.440
And one of them was Linus was asked about

03:53.440 --> 03:56.720
the possibility of launching a new project.

03:56.720 --> 04:00.480
So in Jim's introduction, he pointed out 28 years of Linux,

04:01.120 --> 04:05.040
15 years of Git, and he always forgets mentioning

04:05.040 --> 04:06.400
eight years of subsurface.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.200
The third most important open source.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.680
Third most important open source project, I agree.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.040
I wholeheartedly agree.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.680
But isn't it time for a new project?

04:15.680 --> 04:16.800
No, no, no, no.

04:16.800 --> 04:17.680
I am so done.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.920
I'm very happy with how Git ended up,

04:21.920 --> 04:24.400
but every time Git is mentioned,

04:24.400 --> 04:27.200
I want to make it very, very obvious

04:27.200 --> 04:30.560
that I maintained Git for six months and no more.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.040
And it's been 15 years,

04:33.040 --> 04:36.720
and the real credit goes to Junio Hamano

04:36.720 --> 04:39.520
and a lot of other Git developers.

04:41.520 --> 04:45.200
I'll take credit for the design.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.240
And the thing that makes me happy about Git

04:48.960 --> 04:53.040
is not that it's taken over the world.

04:53.040 --> 04:56.960
It's that we all have self-doubt, right?

04:56.960 --> 05:00.080
We all think, are we actually any good?

05:00.640 --> 05:03.200
And one of the self-doubts I had with Linux

05:03.200 --> 05:06.960
was it was just a re-implementation of Unix, right?

05:07.600 --> 05:11.040
Can I do something that isn't just a better version

05:11.040 --> 05:17.360
of something else and Git proved that yes, I can?

05:17.360 --> 05:18.000
Yes, you can.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.560
And that to me, having two projects

05:24.560 --> 05:27.280
that made a big splash means that I'm not,

05:28.240 --> 05:32.720
three projects, means that I'm not like this one-hit wonder.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.200
To those in the audience who don't get the joke,

05:35.200 --> 05:38.320
so the third project subsurface is one that I now maintain,

05:38.320 --> 05:41.360
so I keep trying to talk it up, but it's okay.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.800
I thought that was very human that even Linus.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.640
Yeah, right, the Linus Torvalds.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.760
We all have imposter syndrome and doubt our own talents,

05:51.760 --> 05:54.000
even when you're top of the open source world.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.920
I never would have thought that Linux,

05:55.920 --> 05:57.920
you'd think an accomplishment like Linux

05:57.920 --> 06:03.200
would be so clearly a major accomplishment

06:03.200 --> 06:05.520
that you wouldn't doubt it, you wouldn't question it.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.640
But the human mind, Wes, it finds a way.

06:10.960 --> 06:11.920
It's sneaky like that.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.920
It'll make you feel bad about anything great you've done.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.240
Dumb mind.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.600
Right? I wonder if there's a world where Linux was less popular

06:19.600 --> 06:21.520
and Git became his biggest project.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.400
I didn't think in some ways it's touched so many more circles.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.800
I mean, yes, Linux runs everywhere and is great,

06:26.800 --> 06:28.640
and that's the whole point of the show,

06:28.640 --> 06:30.960
but so many people who have no idea about Linux

06:30.960 --> 06:32.400
or couldn't care less about Linux,

06:32.400 --> 06:34.240
well, they all collaborate on GitHub.

06:34.240 --> 06:35.600
There was another bit in here

06:35.600 --> 06:37.360
that I never really paid much attention to

06:37.360 --> 06:41.200
because there's no real public-facing example of it,

06:41.200 --> 06:45.120
but were you aware, Wes, that the kernel has secret code names?

06:45.120 --> 06:46.800
Secret code names?

06:46.800 --> 06:49.120
Yeah, each release, like a distro.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.480
Well, now we got to hear some.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.280
A few years ago, you started using code names

06:53.280 --> 06:55.040
for the development kernels,

06:55.040 --> 06:57.440
and in the new release of RC5,

06:57.440 --> 07:00.000
you changed the code name of the current kernel.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.280
Can you talk about that?

07:03.280 --> 07:03.760
I've used...

07:05.040 --> 07:06.560
How many in the audience know

07:06.560 --> 07:08.880
that kernels don't only have version numbers?

07:08.880 --> 07:09.920
They have names, too.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.480
See, most people now...

07:12.480 --> 07:15.280
Yeah, so it's not just a few years ago.

07:15.280 --> 07:19.040
I've done this since way before 1.0.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.160
The kernels have always...

07:20.160 --> 07:22.240
In the main top-level makefile,

07:22.240 --> 07:25.360
there's a name variable that gets set,

07:25.360 --> 07:27.840
and it's usually a random creature.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.200
Where I live, there was this one squirrel

07:35.200 --> 07:39.840
that kept running in front of my car for a week,

07:39.840 --> 07:43.040
and so I named the kernel SuicidalSquirrel.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.080
And the name is not used anywhere.

07:46.080 --> 07:48.560
It's literally just a variable that gets set

07:48.560 --> 07:50.400
and then never ever used again,

07:50.400 --> 07:52.880
but it's been this ongoing joke for me

07:52.880 --> 07:55.440
for the last 20-plus years.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.400
And I think Greg names his stable kernels, too.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.520
And if something happens,

08:03.520 --> 08:07.120
either in the news or in my personal life,

08:07.120 --> 08:09.840
you can sometimes see it in the name change.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.040
So the last release on Sunday,

08:13.040 --> 08:16.240
name change to Kleptomaniac Octopus,

08:16.880 --> 08:18.880
because we were diving.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.960
This is what Dirk was aiming for.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.080
We were diving and playing with an octopus,

08:24.080 --> 08:26.000
and two different octopus.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.800
And the first one tried to steal my flashlight,

08:29.600 --> 08:32.960
and the second one tried to steal Dirk's camera.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.000
And the picture of that,

08:34.000 --> 08:35.760
if you look at my Twitter handle,

08:35.760 --> 08:37.280
that was up a moment ago,

08:37.280 --> 08:39.280
I actually posted a picture of that.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.920
It's pretty hilarious when the octopus goes for my camera.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.480
So the name has absolutely no meaning,

08:44.480 --> 08:46.000
but sometimes you can guess that,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.800
oh, something happened in Linus's life

08:48.800 --> 08:52.800
where some random animal did something silly.

08:52.800 --> 08:57.280
SuicidalSquirrel was 3.12 RC1,

08:57.840 --> 09:01.440
and Kleptomaniac Octopus was 5.4 RC5.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.400
That's great.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.960
I like this one, Blurry Fishbutt.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.760
I want to know the deal behind Wet Seal.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.520
What was the story there?

09:09.520 --> 09:11.040
Or Deceased Newt?

09:11.040 --> 09:11.540
Aw.

09:12.320 --> 09:16.000
Or one that's not really an animal, Series 4800.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.360
Don't know, don't know.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.680
But how are you feeling, Wes?

09:19.680 --> 09:20.240
Are you ready?

09:20.240 --> 09:22.400
Do you have an SSH session open to our Arch server?

09:22.400 --> 09:24.960
Are you ready for one of those famous live Arch server updates?

09:24.960 --> 09:26.560
This is our follow-up episode after all.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.560
Establishing connection right now, Chris.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.800
All right, well, we figured we've collected

09:32.800 --> 09:35.360
a lot of topics on this show, told you a lot of things

09:35.360 --> 09:38.080
we've switched to or tried, and it was time to tell you

09:38.080 --> 09:42.160
how they're holding up, so we start with the Arch server.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.920
Of course, something that we're keeping on top of all the time,

09:45.920 --> 09:46.400
right, Wes?

09:46.400 --> 09:49.040
I'm sure we've been doing lots, yeah, lots of updates.

09:49.040 --> 09:49.540
That's right.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.320
Synchronizing package databases,

09:52.320 --> 09:54.880
totally not a, totally not 173 of these right here.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.720
Including a new stable kernel.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.000
Jog my memory.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.280
Jog my memory, did we switch this box over to the LTS kernel

10:03.280 --> 10:04.720
or did we not do that yet?

10:04.720 --> 10:05.360
Yes, we did.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.240
We got a little less crazy on the Arch front.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.080
Okay, Wes, let's do it.

10:10.800 --> 10:12.160
Hit the upgrade button.

10:12.160 --> 10:15.680
Now, this is a little bit more critical while I'm on the road

10:16.320 --> 10:18.800
because I use WireGuard to connect into the studio

10:19.360 --> 10:20.880
to do a lot of job functions.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.200
I do see a new version of WireGuard

10:23.200 --> 10:25.360
coming on down the pipe right now.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.360
We got a new kernel, got a new WireGuard.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.600
New GCC.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.480
All kinds of good stuff.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.360
Probably means a new ZFS, DKMS module.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.760
Yeah, we're gonna need to rebuild some of those, that's for sure.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.360
This is probably the most critical update we've ever done

10:39.360 --> 10:41.200
because if it breaks, I'm really screwed.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.760
Yeah, you know we have a show to record this week.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.840
Yeah, yeah, I pretty much WireGuard in

10:47.840 --> 10:49.760
almost every single day to do something.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.560
Oh, a new version of Docker, that doesn't matter for us, right?

10:52.560 --> 10:54.720
No, we just run everything in Docker, what could go wrong?

10:55.360 --> 10:56.160
It's gonna be fine.

10:56.160 --> 11:00.000
Now, for those of you new to the show, Chris and Wes do not recommend

11:00.000 --> 11:03.440
that you run a rolling release distro as a server

11:03.440 --> 11:06.320
unless you really can babysit the thing.

11:06.320 --> 11:10.320
But what Wes and I wanted to do was try to build an arch server

11:10.320 --> 11:12.640
with as few moving parts as possible

11:13.280 --> 11:16.480
so that we could test the theory if it's possible

11:16.480 --> 11:19.840
to build a minimum viable Linux server and run it rolling

11:19.840 --> 11:23.040
with the applications containerized whenever possible,

11:23.040 --> 11:25.360
the data broken off onto its own array,

11:25.360 --> 11:31.200
in ZFS, in theory, the arch system is just a user land set of tools,

11:31.200 --> 11:34.720
the kernel gets it going, and then it fires up the containers

11:34.720 --> 11:36.720
and gets us access to our data.

11:36.720 --> 11:40.960
So this was our philosophy when building a minimum viable arch server.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.760
Don't recommend it, but we're doing it so you don't have to.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.200
Where are we at there, Wes?

11:45.200 --> 11:48.640
Well, we're currently removing the current set of ZFS packages

11:48.640 --> 11:51.280
and DKMS on its way to build a new one.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.360
However, we're gonna need to do that again

11:53.360 --> 11:55.680
because there's some updates on the open ZFS side

11:55.680 --> 11:57.120
that we need to get in place as well.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.840
You ever wonder if there's a better way to do these kind of updates?

11:59.840 --> 12:02.400
Like you've already crossed the point of no return now

12:03.120 --> 12:04.960
before we even installed the new stuff.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.280
We just got to not reboot, I guess.

12:07.280 --> 12:08.000
Yeah.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.200
And that said, we do have those snapper snapshots set up

12:11.200 --> 12:13.760
and it did take one right before we started this upgrade.

12:13.760 --> 12:17.440
So we've got a recovery path, we just don't want to have to use it.

12:17.440 --> 12:17.920
True.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.920
That was part of our belt and suspenders approach,

12:19.920 --> 12:21.360
was getting snapshots in there.

12:21.360 --> 12:26.000
If this was a VM system, I would absolutely take a VM snapshot as well,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.440
but we're running it on bare metal super micro box

12:29.440 --> 12:30.960
that I got from Unix Surplus.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.160
Old school.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.440
Still would buy it again.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.080
I got to say, speaking of follow-ups of all follow-ups.

12:36.080 --> 12:39.360
That has just been such a great recommendation by Alan Jude right there.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.640
Yep, I would buy that again.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.560
Unix Surplus was a good way to go.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.760
There's probably other ways to do it too, but it's been pretty great.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.000
So I guess I'll kind of know when you do it

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
because I'll lose connection to the studio.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.920
I'll lose connection to the studio for a bit.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.640
So nothing like doing it live.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.760
I'm only sweating a little bit over here, but thankfully you can't see it.

12:59.760 --> 13:00.560
That's true.

13:00.560 --> 13:01.360
That's true.

13:01.360 --> 13:06.880
Oh, oh, we're loading our freshly compiled ZFS module.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.480
That built pretty fast actually.

13:08.480 --> 13:09.280
Yeah, not too bad.

13:09.280 --> 13:14.160
All right, now we are going to go update our AntRAM FS as one needs to do.

13:14.160 --> 13:18.240
I have to admit this box went a little bit longer than we'd normally go

13:18.240 --> 13:22.880
because there's been some transitions at work, plus I've been on the road.

13:22.880 --> 13:28.400
So this entered the worst case scenario zone as far as I'm concerned.

13:28.400 --> 13:33.200
I think we intended to probably upgrade this thing at least every 30 days.

13:33.200 --> 13:36.160
Yeah, you know, once a month at least, maybe more often,

13:36.160 --> 13:37.440
depending on how often it comes up.

13:37.440 --> 13:40.000
Because, you know, with Arch, most of the time,

13:40.000 --> 13:41.760
it's just a couple of packages if you stay up on it.

13:41.760 --> 13:42.800
It's not a big deal.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.760
And if something does break, well, you only upgraded six things.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.800
And usually there's a note about what went wrong.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.560
Okay, I'm not nervous.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.760
I'm not sweating.

13:51.760 --> 13:52.880
It's totally fine.

13:53.440 --> 13:54.560
I'm not concerned.

13:54.560 --> 13:55.600
We're good now.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.720
So we've moved on.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.520
We're using Yeay, the AUR helper on this box,

13:59.520 --> 14:02.400
which I've been very pleased with and continue to be.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.800
So it's figured out that we also have some AUR upgrades that are needed.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.400
And now we are compiling the newer version of OpenCFS.

14:10.400 --> 14:10.960
Oh.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.600
Yeah, so previously we upgraded the new kernel.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.080
That was smart enough for DKMS to figure out

14:16.080 --> 14:17.680
that it needed to go rebuild the module

14:17.680 --> 14:21.200
from the existing code base for the module for the new kernel.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.760
Now we're getting a new code base for ZFS.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.960
And then we'll build the module for the new kernel and that.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.680
Boy, that's really good that you mentioned that

14:29.680 --> 14:33.120
because my standard move there would have been to skip AUR updates

14:33.120 --> 14:34.880
when you're just doing a core server upgrade.

14:34.880 --> 14:38.800
So I'm glad you're the one driving right now.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.080
So you keep an eye on that.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.440
Flag me when it's ready.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.320
I want to move on to some of the follow up that we wanted to do

14:44.320 --> 14:48.320
because this got kind of kicked off when I tweeted a question

14:48.320 --> 14:50.720
about how our Nextcloud install is doing.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.680
And so I wanted to go look up everything about it

14:53.680 --> 14:57.840
so that way we could talk a little bit about how big it is,

14:57.840 --> 15:00.080
how it has worked or hasn't worked for us

15:00.080 --> 15:04.240
because Nextcloud promises for a team like us

15:04.240 --> 15:07.680
to solve the horrendous cost of Dropbox.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.520
A Dropbox pro account or enterprise,

15:09.520 --> 15:13.680
whatever the crap they call it, is $1,000 a year for five users

15:13.680 --> 15:15.280
and you have to have a minimum of five users.

15:16.000 --> 15:16.560
It's too much.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.640
And our core function here is we record a podcast

15:20.640 --> 15:24.080
and we need to share the files with an editor like Drew.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.560
You know how mad he gets if you don't send him the files right away?

15:26.560 --> 15:27.280
You know what, Wes?

15:27.840 --> 15:29.680
He gets so mad.

15:29.680 --> 15:33.040
He really, he gets so mad that I just have a soundboard clip of it.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.080
I get so mad.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.360
So that's how you know he gets so mad.

15:36.160 --> 15:38.160
We want to send Drew Flacks, for example,

15:38.160 --> 15:40.240
or we have a bunch of assets

15:40.240 --> 15:42.560
that we want to work with for putting a show together

15:42.560 --> 15:45.120
or Cheese is working on an art project

15:45.120 --> 15:47.680
and he wants to share it with us and sync it and back it up.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.720
So in the past, we had used Dropbox.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.960
The Dropbox advantage would be they manage the server,

15:54.960 --> 15:56.080
they manage the storage,

15:56.720 --> 16:00.560
and they have a really high speed CDN network.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.440
So you get a pretty decent user experience.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.200
It works fairly good for transferring large media files.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.840
Even people that are spread out around the world.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.960
And for the most part, other than the cost,

16:12.960 --> 16:15.360
you really don't have to even give any thought to the storage.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.600
It just grows as you need it.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.800
Nextcloud, when you roll it yourself,

16:21.360 --> 16:22.800
doesn't have a global CDN,

16:23.440 --> 16:25.360
doesn't have anybody managing the storage,

16:26.080 --> 16:29.360
and for the most part, it's cheaper

16:30.000 --> 16:32.560
until you really start using it a lot

16:32.560 --> 16:34.720
and then it can get pretty expensive.

16:34.720 --> 16:35.840
So I want to talk about that too

16:35.840 --> 16:38.800
because it sort of depends on how we have it deployed.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.720
And in this case, what we opted to do

16:41.360 --> 16:44.320
was deploy Nextcloud on DigitalOcean.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.560
And when we made this decision,

16:47.120 --> 16:50.800
we experimented with different DigitalOcean data center regions

16:50.800 --> 16:53.760
to try to find a somewhat middle ground

16:53.760 --> 16:57.680
between transfer rates for folks in Texas versus Savannah

16:57.680 --> 17:00.640
versus London versus Seattle versus New York

17:00.640 --> 17:01.440
and et cetera, et cetera.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.960
Just where we have people spread out,

17:02.960 --> 17:05.760
we wanted to stand up instances in different areas

17:05.760 --> 17:07.920
in different data center locations

17:07.920 --> 17:10.160
and see if they made any noticeable difference

17:10.160 --> 17:10.880
in transfer speeds.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.640
Well, yes, they do, very much so.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.280
So we ended up kind of, I think, splitting the difference.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.880
Wes, do you remember what data center?

17:16.880 --> 17:18.800
Located in NYC right now.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.240
Okay, so we went on the East Coast

17:20.880 --> 17:23.440
to help Drew and Savannah and Joe in London.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.880
It just kind of made the most sense

17:24.880 --> 17:27.840
because folks in Texas still got a decent connection

17:27.840 --> 17:31.440
and it was totally serviceable for Wes and I on the West Coast.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.360
And now, like right now, when I'm traveling,

17:33.360 --> 17:35.520
it's sort of more centralized to where I'm at.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.120
We solved that one problem.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.600
But then we had the problem of storage

17:39.600 --> 17:43.040
because one of the problems with past attempts

17:43.040 --> 17:46.000
to use Nextcloud was we would just run out of disk.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.640
Everybody's working away on the team.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.800
They're saving files every single day.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.920
Maybe you have it keeping copies of deleted files too

17:53.920 --> 17:55.600
so that takes up space.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.760
And it would just grow and grow and grow.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.000
We eventually would extinguish local storage

18:00.000 --> 18:02.400
and we'd have to come up with all these different solutions.

18:02.400 --> 18:06.880
I one time famously almost lost an entire episode of Unfilter

18:06.880 --> 18:09.760
because the Nextcloud system started to eat itself.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.400
And I swore off Nextcloud for like a year after that.

18:12.960 --> 18:16.720
But this time around, we had a couple of advantages.

18:17.280 --> 18:19.840
We had an idea of how to solve the storage issue

18:19.840 --> 18:23.600
and we had people on the team that had used Nextcloud.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.680
I'll talk about what storage option we went with

18:25.680 --> 18:26.720
because it's very unique.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.560
But before we get to that,

18:28.560 --> 18:30.320
I thought I'd let Cheese chime in on this part

18:30.320 --> 18:32.640
because you were there when we were really trying

18:32.640 --> 18:34.640
to make the decision about dropping Dropbox

18:34.640 --> 18:35.600
and switching to Nextcloud

18:35.600 --> 18:37.360
and you were one of the guys advocating for it.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.360
And I'm curious with what,

18:39.360 --> 18:41.200
over a year now that we've been running it,

18:41.200 --> 18:43.920
what your hindsight is on that original discussion

18:43.920 --> 18:47.200
and using Nextcloud in production as we have.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.040
Overall, it's been a pretty good experience.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.920
There has been times where, you know,

18:51.920 --> 18:54.080
syncing all of the things,

18:54.080 --> 18:56.320
maybe it's not quite as intelligent as Dropbox

18:56.320 --> 18:56.960
in some regard,

18:56.960 --> 19:00.400
it seemed like it would flood and just saturate the Droplet,

19:00.960 --> 19:03.120
preventing others from accessing

19:03.120 --> 19:07.920
or having varied quality with their throughput to the server.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.000
But overall, it's been pretty good.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.280
In my personal Dropbox,

19:11.840 --> 19:13.840
at one point I had, you know,

19:13.840 --> 19:16.160
like WeChat and Tmux kind of set up

19:16.160 --> 19:20.000
and then I had tiny RSS for news feeds

19:20.000 --> 19:22.400
and just a bunch of random little Droplets.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.640
And I was able to condense majority of that into Nextcloud.

19:26.640 --> 19:30.240
So there's a news application that you can add on.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.400
It's been great for me.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.640
The companion app for the Android device

19:34.640 --> 19:36.560
for the news app is great.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.040
You use the notes app,

19:39.040 --> 19:41.280
which also you can preview and mark down.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.560
I don't know what we're up to now with the JB

19:44.560 --> 19:46.560
because the amount of storage that we have there,

19:46.560 --> 19:48.720
but I'm spending 10 bucks a month.

19:49.280 --> 19:52.160
So a $5 Droplet and excuse me,

19:52.160 --> 19:53.760
a $10 Droplet, $15 a month,

19:53.760 --> 19:58.320
a $10 Droplet and 50 gigs of volume storage.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.640
The use of Nextcloud for yourself

20:00.640 --> 20:03.280
and a significant other is really great

20:03.280 --> 20:06.320
because as you go on, you've got documents,

20:06.320 --> 20:08.320
you know, just all kinds of things

20:08.320 --> 20:12.000
for vehicle purchases or insurance stuff.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.280
There's just so many places

20:13.280 --> 20:15.520
where you both want access to something

20:16.080 --> 20:18.240
and a lot of it is confidential.

20:18.240 --> 20:20.720
And I'm not super confident storing that stuff

20:20.720 --> 20:23.600
in any cloud service that's on somebody else's

20:23.600 --> 20:24.000
service.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.480
So being able to run Nextcloud on your LAN

20:26.480 --> 20:29.040
or on a Droplet that you have root access to

20:29.040 --> 20:30.960
is, it's a huge feature of it.

20:30.960 --> 20:35.200
And I wasn't sure if it would go from that scenario

20:35.200 --> 20:36.560
to a team scenario,

20:36.560 --> 20:38.320
but Drew, you're also a Nextcloud guy

20:38.320 --> 20:40.320
and you were advocating for us to give it a shot.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.280
I'm curious what you think now a year plus into using it.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.880
And from a perspective of somebody

20:44.880 --> 20:47.440
who's often looking to get files

20:47.440 --> 20:49.920
from the various hosts that are spread around the world,

20:49.920 --> 20:52.080
you're looking at it maybe in a bit more

20:52.080 --> 20:54.400
of a day-to-day production scenario than I am

20:54.400 --> 20:56.320
where I just drop files on there for you.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.000
It makes a big difference in your day.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.520
So what I like about it,

20:59.520 --> 21:04.480
which is not necessarily unique to Nextcloud per se,

21:04.480 --> 21:06.880
but I really like the permission systems

21:06.880 --> 21:12.080
and being able to hand a URL to like a contractor

21:12.080 --> 21:17.120
or a guest and have it just be a Dropbox for them

21:17.120 --> 21:20.560
to upload files without actually giving them access

21:20.560 --> 21:22.880
to read anything in the system.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.160
I love that feature.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.400
I can get stuff from people

21:26.400 --> 21:28.640
without actually creating an account

21:28.640 --> 21:32.000
or having to do any kind of complicated stuff.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.400
It's literally just drop the file on the browser,

21:34.400 --> 21:34.880
you're done.

21:35.520 --> 21:39.520
And being able to do specific syncs,

21:40.320 --> 21:42.080
like specific folders

21:42.080 --> 21:46.720
where I don't have to pull down everything to me is great.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.760
Especially given that with Dropbox,

21:49.760 --> 21:53.200
you have to default to sync all

21:53.200 --> 21:55.840
and then you have to go in and unselect everything.

21:55.840 --> 21:56.800
Whereas with Nextcloud,

21:56.800 --> 21:58.160
you can take the opposite approach

21:58.160 --> 22:00.080
and I just sync specific folders,

22:00.720 --> 22:02.080
which is great for me

22:02.080 --> 22:05.360
because it significantly limits the amount of stuff

22:05.360 --> 22:06.720
that I have to actually pull down.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.560
Because like I don't need Jesus design folder

22:10.560 --> 22:11.680
on my local computer.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.800
I don't need half the stuff in our team share.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.760
I really just need these raw audio files.

22:17.760 --> 22:18.880
And so that's what I sync.

22:18.880 --> 22:22.240
So the ability to really narrow it down

22:22.240 --> 22:24.080
and have that much more control

22:24.080 --> 22:28.320
over what we're doing versus how I felt Dropbox was,

22:29.120 --> 22:32.640
it's to me it's a significant improvement.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.480
Yeah, I like your point about

22:34.480 --> 22:36.800
it's much safer and simpler

22:36.800 --> 22:39.920
to just loop in a contractor or a new team member

22:40.480 --> 22:42.240
and just set them up an account

22:42.240 --> 22:44.640
and get them going with Dropbox.

22:44.640 --> 22:45.920
It would be a license

22:45.920 --> 22:47.680
and it would be a significant cost.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.680
I have found myself in the past

22:49.680 --> 22:52.400
creating a contractor account

22:52.400 --> 22:54.080
that I pay one license for

22:54.080 --> 22:55.600
and then I just change the password

22:55.600 --> 22:57.280
when I share it with different people.

22:57.280 --> 22:58.720
I'm sure that's probably not the way

22:58.720 --> 23:00.080
Dropbox wants me doing it.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.240
You know, I don't think that's the way

23:02.240 --> 23:03.360
anyone wants you to do it.

23:03.360 --> 23:04.800
No, I don't even like it.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.480
So that's one of the things I've definitely liked

23:06.480 --> 23:08.640
about switching to Nextcloud.

23:08.640 --> 23:12.960
So right now, as we record our monthly run cost

23:12.960 --> 23:16.720
for 161 gigabytes of data in the cloud

23:17.280 --> 23:22.080
and the Droplet that runs it is $305 a month,

23:22.080 --> 23:24.240
which obviously is quite a bit.

23:24.720 --> 23:26.640
I'm not happy with that to tell you the truth

23:26.640 --> 23:28.880
because one of the things we wanted to do

23:28.880 --> 23:32.640
was lower the cost by switching from Dropbox.

23:32.640 --> 23:35.840
And any of you who are doing the quick math

23:35.840 --> 23:39.760
on $305 a month is quickly coming to the realization

23:39.760 --> 23:41.680
that we're paying significantly more

23:41.680 --> 23:44.880
than $1,000 a year for the storage.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.200
But it does bring a lot of other perks and benefits,

23:47.760 --> 23:50.160
one of which of course is that we're hosting ourselves.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.160
But I mentioned we're running on DigitalOcean, Wes.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.280
It's a box with eight gigs of RAM, two virtual CPUs

23:55.280 --> 23:57.920
and 25 gigabytes of local disk.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.520
But it's got a database

23:59.520 --> 24:01.520
and it's got kind of a unique storage setup.

24:01.520 --> 24:02.800
Yeah, you know, well, we were worried

24:02.800 --> 24:04.640
about having to do upgrades,

24:04.640 --> 24:07.040
deal with expanding storage down the road

24:07.040 --> 24:09.920
because, well, some of the team uploads wave files

24:09.920 --> 24:12.240
or just giant flacks for some reason.

24:12.240 --> 24:15.440
And, you know, that stuff eats up disk space really fast.

24:15.440 --> 24:18.160
And pretty much always from production standpoint,

24:18.160 --> 24:20.960
if you can leave the original sources around for a while,

24:20.960 --> 24:22.160
that's just the better option.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.080
You might need them again down the road.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.640
And once they're gone, they're gone.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.480
So we're actually hooking into the backend

24:29.040 --> 24:31.680
and putting all of the stuff that's not just, you know,

24:31.680 --> 24:33.280
some of the configuration files and stuff

24:33.280 --> 24:35.440
that's on the local disk, but all the stuff

24:35.440 --> 24:37.920
that's uploaded through the UI, through the syncing system,

24:37.920 --> 24:40.720
that all lives on DigitalOcean Spaces,

24:40.720 --> 24:42.080
which if you're not a DigitalOcean user,

24:42.080 --> 24:45.680
is basically their S3 equivalent object storage.

24:45.680 --> 24:49.840
Now, did we essentially use Nextcloud's support

24:49.840 --> 24:51.840
for S3 storage to use Spaces?

24:51.840 --> 24:53.280
Is this some sort of hack?

24:53.280 --> 24:55.760
What happened? How did this, how is this possible?

24:55.760 --> 24:58.320
Yeah, so you can go into the Nextcloud configuration

24:58.320 --> 25:00.320
and they've got a storage configuration.

25:00.320 --> 25:03.040
And yeah, they support basically, you know,

25:03.040 --> 25:05.520
anytime it's gonna do some file operations on the backend

25:05.520 --> 25:08.160
instead of writing it to the disk.

25:08.160 --> 25:10.000
Well, in the Nextcloud world,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.160
this is all handled in the database anyway, right?

25:12.160 --> 25:15.040
These are not like, they're not just named the regular name.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.360
There's database entries, there's quids involved,

25:17.360 --> 25:20.240
and then eventually that gets written somewhere on your disk.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.720
So instead, once you've set this up to use S3,

25:23.520 --> 25:25.600
then that call just gets made, sent to the cloud,

25:25.600 --> 25:28.960
stored up there, and from the user experience,

25:28.960 --> 25:29.920
you're none the wiser.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.280
It's totally transparent to you, at least when it works.

25:33.280 --> 25:35.920
The nice part here is while the S3 storage protocol

25:35.920 --> 25:37.760
is not really a standard,

25:37.760 --> 25:38.960
it's been around long enough now

25:38.960 --> 25:40.400
that basically everyone implements it.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.360
So whether you're actually using S3 on real AWS

25:43.360 --> 25:45.440
or you're using DigitalOcean Spaces,

25:45.440 --> 25:48.400
they talk the same language and it pretty much just works.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.160
I haven't seen this lately, it may have been fixed.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.920
I know DigitalOcean had some issues open on it,

25:51.920 --> 25:53.840
but there's a couple different, you know,

25:53.840 --> 25:55.760
nuances of the protocol that they didn't support

25:55.760 --> 25:58.000
exactly the same as Amazon did.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.760
And so it meant when some of our contractors

25:59.760 --> 26:01.280
were uploading multiple files,

26:01.280 --> 26:03.440
some of our contractors were uploading multiple files

26:03.440 --> 26:05.680
at the same time through the web UI.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.880
Specifically, sometimes some of those would fail,

26:08.880 --> 26:11.920
but 95% the rest of the time, you know,

26:11.920 --> 26:14.320
uploads from the studio, uploads that I'm doing,

26:14.320 --> 26:15.760
it's pretty much just worked.

26:15.760 --> 26:19.440
Yeah, I do recall a few issues early on,

26:20.000 --> 26:22.240
like you mentioned when people were uploading multiple files

26:22.240 --> 26:24.240
or if somebody was trying to upload files

26:24.240 --> 26:26.160
and somebody else was cleaning up a directory

26:26.160 --> 26:29.360
at the same time and it involved removing files,

26:29.360 --> 26:31.840
everyone's sync operations would just halt

26:31.840 --> 26:34.000
until something had sorted itself out.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.920
And, you know, sometimes you have an editor

26:35.920 --> 26:36.720
on the other end that's like,

26:36.720 --> 26:37.760
hey, where the hell's my files?

26:37.760 --> 26:41.040
So that was a little sketch, but it seems like it's either

26:41.040 --> 26:43.040
we've all just sort of internalized a way to use NextCloud

26:43.040 --> 26:44.160
that hasn't caused this problem,

26:44.160 --> 26:47.120
or it's just, it hasn't been an issue recently.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.520
The nice part is we just don't have to think about it

26:49.520 --> 26:52.000
because, you know, we just pay for the usage on Spaces.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.960
So someone wants to drop in a giant file,

26:54.960 --> 26:55.840
it doesn't matter at all.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.520
There's no quota, there's no limit.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.600
It pretty much just works.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.760
And you still actually have access

27:01.760 --> 27:02.800
behind the scenes to the system.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.200
So you can go ask in the NextCloud database

27:05.200 --> 27:08.160
and go find out what the long random string name

27:08.160 --> 27:09.280
of the file that you want is,

27:09.280 --> 27:11.360
and then you can access it directly in Spaces too

27:11.360 --> 27:13.440
and take advantage of their CDN system if you want to.

26:57.520 --> 27:15.360
Yeah, which is pretty cool

27:15.360 --> 27:17.200
and it feels pretty performant

27:17.200 --> 27:18.720
as far as we've noticed, you know,

27:18.720 --> 27:20.960
the files come slamming down on our machines

27:20.960 --> 27:25.040
and I generally just use the NextCloud client itself.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.200
I think that tends to work best for me,

27:27.200 --> 27:56.320
but something else that is nice is the web UI

27:56.320 --> 28:25.920
and the fact that we've got $305 a month that we pay

28:25.920 --> 28:53.920
and we've suffered performance penalties for that.

28:53.920 --> 29:23.120
And that meant a managed database server.

29:23.120 --> 29:52.720
So that's something that I think has to change

29:52.720 --> 29:52.720
or the database schemas need to change.

29:52.720 --> 30:22.320
So that's something that I think has to change.

30:22.320 --> 30:51.920
So that's something that I think has to change.

30:51.920 --> 31:21.520
So that's something that I think has to change.

31:21.520 --> 31:51.120
What I opted to do for that kind of stuff is use something else, and I didn't want to get sucked back into the Dropbox situation, I decided to double down again on Syncthing, something I've tried in the past when it was brand new.

31:51.120 --> 32:05.920
And I just found that so frustrating because there's not really a way in Syncthing to say, maybe there is at the configuration file, but in the web UI, there's not really a way to say sync to this IP, right?

32:05.920 --> 32:09.280
You sync to a machine ID, which looks like a Bitcoin address.

32:09.280 --> 32:14.400
It's not like 192.168.0.5 and now it's syncing.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.320
It's a big old hash.

32:16.320 --> 32:19.680
And so when it quits discovering it after that, it's like you got no recourse.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.800
And so that would drive me crazy and I would quit using it.

32:22.800 --> 32:34.400
And then the other thing that was just unforgivable for me was, say it was just going along, doing its little sync thing, maybe for a few months, just syncing right along.

32:34.400 --> 32:39.440
And then it would just stop and then it would never connect back up and it would never sync.

32:39.440 --> 32:45.200
And I wouldn't know that was happening because there was no immediate error messages and my machines just would fall out of sync.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.040
And that just drove me nuts.

32:47.040 --> 32:51.760
Now, keep in mind, this is a couple of years ago, this is like when BitTorrent sync was still a thing.

32:51.760 --> 32:58.320
And I kind of hit the pause button and said, I'm going to come back and visit Syncthing in a couple of years and see how it's doing.

32:58.320 --> 33:03.360
And boy, am I glad that I did, because am I just using the hell out of it now?

33:03.360 --> 33:11.520
I use Syncthing more and more because the beautiful, beautiful thing about Syncthing is it's peer to peer, no cloud service at all.

33:11.520 --> 33:16.160
So your storage is whatever you got in disk space on your machine.

33:16.160 --> 33:20.640
So if you've got machines with terabytes of storage, then you've got terabytes of syncing.

33:20.640 --> 33:33.520
The other thing I absolutely love about it is it essentially creates a network file system for me that doesn't require any fancy VPN or crazy ass file system.

33:33.520 --> 33:42.640
In fact, it can be across multiple OS's using multiple different file systems and they just sync because with Syncthing, you can sync any folder,

33:42.640 --> 33:48.880
much like you can with the next cloud client if you set it up right, but not like Dropbox where Dropbox only syncs the Dropbox folder, right?

33:48.880 --> 33:50.240
Syncthing syncs anything.

33:50.240 --> 33:51.760
It has its own little world. Yeah.

33:51.760 --> 33:56.400
Yeah. And so I can point at maybe a media folder on a server.

33:56.400 --> 33:59.120
I can point at an editing working directory over here.

33:59.120 --> 34:06.880
It just syncs and you put something in one place and it just shows up in the other place, even if it's some five directories deep folder.

34:06.880 --> 34:14.560
And what I realized is this was a brilliant solution for clients of mine that look to move media files around.

34:14.560 --> 34:23.520
So I've launched this ChrisLass.com consulting arm, which is part of the Chris Lass empire.

34:23.520 --> 34:28.560
I'll take over the world with my podcasting consulting anyways.

34:28.560 --> 34:44.080
And I realized that I would get people all set up with a lot of things going into a podcast, but I wouldn't have a solution for how to actually move files from where they're recorded to somebody who's editing or transfer stuff back and forth.

34:44.080 --> 34:50.720
And we experimented with Firefox and for a little while and that that was frustrating for people and on people that run only Linux.

34:50.720 --> 34:55.680
I had them try magic wormhole for a bit, but that was too clunky because it requires dropping to the command line.

34:55.680 --> 35:00.240
And then one day it just hit me. Sync thing, you idiot, just use sync thing.

35:00.240 --> 35:10.160
And there's like a sync thing tray application you can get for Windows and there's a sync thing bundle you can get for the Mac that takes sync thing and makes it usable for those platforms.

35:10.160 --> 35:15.520
And then, of course, it's just available on Linux as a package and it works fantastic.

35:15.520 --> 35:24.720
I set them up with a little sync thing instance and then I pointed at a directory on their folder and I just say, when you need to send something to an editor, put it in this folder.

35:24.720 --> 35:30.560
And then I have their editor on the other end, install the bundle, set up a directory and give me the ID.

35:30.560 --> 35:34.480
The two things discover each other over the sync thing network.

35:34.480 --> 35:40.560
They have a little broadcast system they use and a little relay system, and then they connect peer to peer and they begin syncing.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.760
And it just works now. It doesn't so far.

35:43.760 --> 35:50.960
None of them have lost sync. None of them have failed to discover each other.

35:50.960 --> 35:58.720
It's worked every single time. And I've also started using it as a way to move home media files around.

35:58.720 --> 36:07.600
I've got a Blu-ray player at the studio or I've got a DVD or something that I've ripped to my hard drive and I've made a big old fat MKV out of it like I do.

36:07.600 --> 36:11.440
And I want to get that to the RV. Well, the RV has a super slow connection.

36:11.440 --> 36:24.640
It's on my fi and I don't want to sneaker net it because that's a pain in the butt to hook up a drive, copy it over and then you get home and get to my Raspberry Pi and plug it in and then SSH in and copy the file to this.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.760
Just who's got time for that? Nobody.

36:27.760 --> 36:33.360
I just point sync thing at the TV or movie folders that I want to have currently at the RV.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.560
Like right now, I've recently got into the television show Alone.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.080
Have you heard of this? No.

36:38.080 --> 36:42.880
You should watch Alone because they film a lot of it in the Pacific Northwest. So it's pretty great.

36:42.880 --> 36:54.640
Oh, it's like 10 contestants go out to Vancouver Island and have no contact with society, have no assistance except for the 10 things they can bring in their bag.

36:54.640 --> 36:59.760
And then whoever lasts the longest wins five hundred thousand dollars.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.440
It's silly, but it's a lot of fun.

37:01.440 --> 37:14.880
And I watch it with the family and I decided, you know, why why sit here and move these files all around when I could just sync them using sync thing and been able to just set that up, point it at my Raspberry Pi and it just goes.

37:14.880 --> 37:30.800
And when a new episode comes out and I have it in the folder on my server, it just over time as you know, however long it takes, trickles down to the RV and sync thing is pretty good about not abusing your bandwidth, about noticing if there's other things going on.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.240
And sort of scaling back.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.320
So I don't even really notice a hit.

37:34.320 --> 37:38.880
I maybe every now and then have gone in and pausing thing for a bit.

37:38.880 --> 37:44.400
So that way I have just a little bit more of the kilobits, but it works pretty well.

37:46.960 --> 37:51.280
All right, Wes, it's time to check in on that arch server upgrade.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.480
How's it doing over there?

37:52.480 --> 37:56.000
Colonel's upgrade DKMS has been rebuilt.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.480
So we're ready to reboot.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.080
Yeah, that's reboot time.

38:00.080 --> 38:04.320
All right, ping is going and reboot is away.

38:04.320 --> 38:13.920
So as if you were going to set yourself up a home server, like an actual home server, do you think you'd do you think you'd go with something as complicated as we've done here?

38:13.920 --> 38:14.800
Would you go with arch?

38:14.800 --> 38:15.840
Would you go with next cloud?

38:15.840 --> 38:16.400
What would you do?

38:17.040 --> 38:18.160
Oh, good question.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.640
You know, honestly, I've been pretty impressed.

38:20.640 --> 38:29.600
The arch system has really not been as painful as I thought that it might when we first discussed this kind of crazy plan, keeping things simple, not overloading the system.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.920
And mostly just running everything containerized.

38:31.920 --> 38:33.040
That has helped a lot.

38:33.760 --> 38:37.600
I would be tempted now that it's post 2004.

38:37.600 --> 38:40.160
I honestly I'd be very tempted for my personal stuff.

38:40.160 --> 38:50.000
If I didn't need any customization or if I wasn't trying to do something really fancy in the arch setup, you know, where the minimalism and simplicity helped, I would probably just install 2004.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.160
Just especially because the ZFS stuff is taken care of for you.

38:54.160 --> 38:58.400
Arch has been the best besides Ubuntu, I think for us by far in that respect.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.960
But you just can't beat Canonical building it for you.

39:00.960 --> 39:01.760
Yeah.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.920
And I think the math has changed here a little bit.

39:03.920 --> 39:11.520
In the past, arch was how we got access to the most recent, freshest packages.

39:11.520 --> 39:15.360
You know, and you and I doing this show and just kind of being the guys we are.

39:15.360 --> 39:16.000
That's what we like.

39:16.000 --> 39:16.880
We like getting that.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.480
We like getting the latest software.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.720
Give me the beta, whatever you translated to Rust.

39:20.720 --> 39:21.600
I just want to run it.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.480
But do you really need that anymore?

39:24.480 --> 39:26.560
Is that really how you need to get software?

39:26.560 --> 39:32.080
I mean, with everything either in a container or in a flat pack or a snap, like, do you

39:32.080 --> 39:35.520
really need to be running a rolling distro to get the latest software?

39:36.320 --> 39:38.960
That's kind of one of the things I think we're also trying to test out here is,

39:39.600 --> 39:40.720
is there still a benefit to it?

39:41.280 --> 39:44.960
I think it depends too on how high touch a system is.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.640
And this server is sort of in the middle.

39:46.640 --> 39:50.320
There's some weeks where we're doing stuff or setting up a project that we're playing with.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.640
And I'm kind of glad that it's arch because it's so simple.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.680
We understand the system because there's not a bunch of stuff configured in the background

39:55.680 --> 39:56.560
that we didn't set up.

39:57.280 --> 40:00.960
But the flip side of that is if it's just a box that you leave in the corner,

40:00.960 --> 40:04.000
you set it up once, you never want to touch it again.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.920
Well, that's not where art shines.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.280
Yeah, very true.

40:07.280 --> 40:07.600
All right.

40:07.600 --> 40:10.400
Well, while you're doing that, because I know it's going to take a minute,

40:10.400 --> 40:11.760
let's sneak in a little housekeeping.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.680
I don't have a whole bunch to update everybody on on the housekeeping,

40:17.680 --> 40:21.040
but I want to give a plug for the old self-hosted podcast.

40:21.040 --> 40:22.800
Check it out at selfhosted.show.

40:22.800 --> 40:27.200
I say old now because we've officially crossed the 20 episodes mark.

40:28.400 --> 40:28.880
Thank you.

40:28.880 --> 40:29.760
Thank you.

40:29.760 --> 40:34.000
And episode 22, slow cooked servers.

40:35.280 --> 40:39.360
I give everyone an update on how my Raspberry Pi servers are doing

40:40.080 --> 40:43.040
in the intense Texas heat.

40:43.040 --> 40:50.800
I will tell you now that yesterday my server booth was up to 104 degrees Fahrenheit

40:50.800 --> 40:52.400
where those Raspberry Pis are sitting.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.280
Oh, man.

40:53.280 --> 40:56.800
So I talk about what's going on there, what I'm doing to mitigate that,

40:56.800 --> 40:58.320
and what I think is going to fail first.

40:58.880 --> 41:03.360
And how I monitor all of this is covered in selfhosted.show slash 22.

41:04.000 --> 41:13.120
Plus, Alex goes into this super cool self-hosted image recognition AI tool

41:13.120 --> 41:16.080
that you can throw at like a security camera.

41:16.080 --> 41:20.000
And it can recognize cars, dogs, all these different objects

41:20.000 --> 41:25.680
in the video feed locally on your LAN without having to go in any third-party service

41:25.680 --> 41:28.160
and then generate alerts based on that.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.160
But there's some really other cool things it does,

41:30.160 --> 41:34.480
including how it records the video and all of that to save you a ton of storage.

41:34.480 --> 41:39.520
So Alex can run 4K cameras and not burn through disk like a madman.

41:39.520 --> 41:40.880
It's a really neat system.

41:40.880 --> 41:46.800
So we talk about both those things in a little bit more in self-hosted.show slash 22.

41:46.800 --> 41:50.560
So I just hope by the time I make it back to the Pacific Northwest,

41:50.560 --> 41:54.480
I haven't burned through every Raspberry Pi in the garage.

41:54.480 --> 41:56.800
So check that out, selfhosted.show.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.480
Also, please do join us live.

41:58.480 --> 41:59.760
We do this show on Tuesdays.

41:59.760 --> 42:00.640
We'd love to have you here.

42:01.440 --> 42:04.080
Now, I won't be live on the Tuesday that this came out, Willie.

42:05.360 --> 42:08.080
But normally we are live at jblive.tv.

42:08.080 --> 42:10.640
You can get that at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

42:10.640 --> 42:12.480
And that's why we have the calendar, right?

42:12.480 --> 42:15.040
Is that most of the time we remember to update it

42:15.040 --> 42:17.680
so you'll know in advance if we'll be here or we won't.

42:17.680 --> 42:18.400
That's the theory.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.960
I talk about the live show all the time.

42:20.960 --> 42:25.120
I do not proportionally talk about how much we appreciate everybody downloading the show,

42:25.120 --> 42:27.200
sharing it with friends and that kind of stuff.

42:27.200 --> 42:30.640
That's obviously the vast, vast, vast majority of the audience.

42:30.640 --> 42:31.520
We appreciate you.

42:31.520 --> 42:32.960
We recognize you.

42:32.960 --> 42:33.760
Thank you so much.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.680
So I always talk about the live stream,

42:35.680 --> 42:38.880
but I want to take a moment and say thank you to those who've been downloading the show,

42:39.600 --> 42:42.240
sharing it with friends, anything to help spread the word.

42:42.240 --> 42:44.000
That's that's what makes podcasts tick.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
You know, you don't see a bunch of podcast ads out there

42:46.000 --> 42:49.520
because the only marketing that works for podcasts is the word of mouth.

42:49.520 --> 42:49.920
So thank you.

42:49.920 --> 42:51.200
It's you, the audience.

42:51.200 --> 42:51.680
That's right.

42:51.680 --> 42:52.960
You're the ones that make this possible.

42:52.960 --> 42:57.280
So we will be back at our regularly scheduled live streaming time.

42:57.280 --> 43:04.880
I think the week of the 21st, if you want to join us, July 21st at jblive.tv at noon Pacific.

43:05.600 --> 43:09.440
And then, of course, one more mention for that love blog, which is happening right now.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.000
As we record this episode, you never know what's going to happen during a love blog.

43:12.000 --> 43:18.240
And that's Sunday's same exact time, the same mumble server, same IRC server, just different rooms.

43:18.240 --> 43:19.520
So check all that out.

43:19.520 --> 43:22.880
You've got two days to try and the love blog is a great chance.

43:22.880 --> 43:24.320
If you just, you know, you've got a new microphone,

43:24.320 --> 43:27.200
you've been wanting to join the virtual log for a while.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.000
Try it out on Sunday.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
If everything goes well, then come join us on Tuesday.

43:30.000 --> 43:33.680
Yeah, it's a good way to kind of warm up to maybe if you're a little shy or something like that.

43:33.680 --> 43:34.000
Right.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.400
Start talking with some of our wonderful mumble regulars.

43:37.280 --> 43:37.360
Yep.

43:37.360 --> 43:38.880
Totally understandable and a great way to do it.

43:38.880 --> 43:43.360
All right. That's the housekeeping for this week.

43:43.360 --> 43:45.440
And that puts you back in the hot seat, Wes.

43:45.440 --> 43:46.880
How's that server reboot going?

43:46.880 --> 43:48.000
You say hot seat.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.640
My seat is nice and cool over here.

43:50.640 --> 43:53.200
All of our docker containers back up and running.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.760
ZFS remounted, no issues at all.

43:55.760 --> 43:58.240
And we're on the latest LTS kernel.

43:58.240 --> 43:59.280
You're kidding me.

43:59.280 --> 44:00.320
All like that?

44:00.320 --> 44:01.920
Boom. Arch for the win.

44:01.920 --> 44:06.400
Arch for the win.

44:06.400 --> 44:06.720
Wow.

44:07.520 --> 44:10.480
Not only was that our longest time between updates,

44:10.480 --> 44:12.400
but that's got to be one of the smoothest.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.840
I'm very impressed.

44:13.840 --> 44:18.320
That was an odd issue because essentially everything in the stack got upgraded.

44:18.320 --> 44:22.560
Now, I will say I did have to go build one set of packages by hand just because,

44:22.560 --> 44:26.080
all right, I was previously singing the praises of yay, and I do really like it.

44:26.080 --> 44:30.800
But there's like the way the package dependencies work between ZFS utils and ZFS

44:30.800 --> 44:33.200
DKMS. You have to install both of them at the same time.

44:33.200 --> 44:36.000
Otherwise, you break a dependency on the previous version.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.400
So I just did that by hand in the shell with make package,

44:38.400 --> 44:39.680
which was also pretty simple.

44:41.040 --> 44:41.360
All right.

44:41.360 --> 44:41.920
I'll allow it.

44:42.640 --> 44:44.400
That's borderline though, Wes Payne.

44:44.400 --> 44:45.280
It's borderline.

44:45.280 --> 44:45.760
I know.

44:45.760 --> 44:46.080
I know.

44:47.440 --> 44:47.840
All right.

44:47.840 --> 44:51.200
Moving on to the things that folks asked us to follow up on.

44:51.200 --> 44:52.400
Thoughts on our ThinkPads.

44:52.400 --> 44:53.280
How are they running?

44:54.320 --> 44:55.280
Anything like that.

44:55.280 --> 45:00.800
And Chaz wrote, he says, if we could also talk about maybe if we would spec them differently.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.400
He says, hey, just a quick question.

45:02.400 --> 45:06.320
I'm in the market for a new laptop and thinking about getting one spec'd out with the same way

45:06.320 --> 45:07.360
your T480s are.

45:08.160 --> 45:10.480
He listened to our episode, which was forever ago now.

45:10.480 --> 45:14.480
Like almost, geez, Wes, it was almost two years ago that we got the ThinkPads.

45:14.480 --> 45:14.880
Wow.

45:15.600 --> 45:16.560
That's crazy.

45:16.560 --> 45:17.200
Is that right?

45:17.840 --> 45:18.080
Yeah.

45:18.640 --> 45:20.160
It still kind of feels like a new laptop.

45:20.160 --> 45:20.720
So there's that.

45:20.720 --> 45:26.400
He says, were those the models that had integrated graphics or did they have the MX150 card?

45:26.400 --> 45:30.720
And are there any changes that you would make to their configuration if you could?

45:31.440 --> 45:34.880
Answering the graphics question, they are the Intel integrated graphics.

45:34.880 --> 45:40.240
We did that on purpose to just keep things very simple because these were work machines.

45:40.240 --> 45:43.520
I will say, though, that, you know, those integrated graphics, the modern ones,

45:43.520 --> 45:44.960
really not too bad of a slouch.

45:44.960 --> 45:48.160
Like I'm not playing a ton of games, but 3D shooters, all kinds of stuff on there,

45:48.160 --> 45:49.840
that worked surprisingly fine.

45:49.840 --> 45:54.640
I mean, OK, I turned down some of the graphics settings, but it was playable without a problem.

45:54.640 --> 45:56.240
And then I forgot I'd ever turned those down.

45:56.240 --> 45:57.680
So I was pretty impressed.

45:57.680 --> 45:58.800
On how are they running?

45:59.520 --> 46:01.840
Now, there's not really much to say here.

46:01.840 --> 46:02.480
They just run.

46:03.360 --> 46:04.240
They run great.

46:04.240 --> 46:06.480
What a great Linux machine, really.

46:06.480 --> 46:08.560
I would absolutely fully recommend them.

46:09.120 --> 46:15.760
Now, I'm curious, Wes, would you change the screen and go from 1080p to 4K in 2020?

46:15.760 --> 46:17.600
Oh, that's a good question.

46:17.600 --> 46:22.400
You know, the screen is one of the, let's call it, limiting factors on these bad boys.

46:22.400 --> 46:27.680
And you recently spent a little time with the new XPS 13, which has incredible screen.

46:27.680 --> 46:28.640
Just amazing.

46:28.640 --> 46:30.320
Yeah, I would like a better screen.

46:30.320 --> 46:32.960
It's not so bad, especially, you know, you're going to put it on a dock.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.960
You've already got, you know, monitors on your desk, whatever.

46:34.960 --> 46:35.520
And it's fine.

46:35.520 --> 46:36.480
It works on the plane.

46:36.480 --> 46:37.440
It works at a coffee shop.

46:37.440 --> 46:38.800
Like, you can read it.

46:39.440 --> 46:40.720
I would want a nicer screen, though.

46:40.720 --> 46:41.360
Yeah, probably.

46:41.360 --> 46:46.640
If it was a very high-end 1080p panel, maybe we would feel differently.

46:46.640 --> 46:49.360
But it's just not a great screen.

46:49.360 --> 46:50.160
It'd be terrible, too.

46:50.160 --> 46:52.880
Like, if you're going to try to do any serious graphics work where you needed, you know,

46:52.880 --> 46:55.920
good colors or brightness, like, I take a picture on my phone, I look at it there,

46:55.920 --> 46:59.440
and then I look at the same one in Telegram or something on the ThinkPad.

46:59.440 --> 47:00.560
And it's just a joke.

47:00.560 --> 47:03.600
And on top of that, it's 14 inches.

47:03.600 --> 47:09.040
So I'm not positive 4K would be the right resolution, unless you were pixel doubling

47:09.040 --> 47:09.600
everything.

47:09.600 --> 47:15.280
I think a 2K screen on that 14-inch laptop would be the absolute sweet spot.

47:15.280 --> 47:16.720
But they don't offer it.

47:16.720 --> 47:23.360
So in light of the fact that it's kind of a crappy 1080p panel or a nice 4K panel, at

47:23.360 --> 47:25.280
this point, I'd go with the 4K panel.

47:25.280 --> 47:28.000
I don't think I would have a year ago, but I think I would now.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.080
One thing I wouldn't change, keep that 32 gigs of RAM.

47:32.080 --> 47:36.000
Maybe it's not essential, but it's just been so nice, especially when, you know, you're

47:36.000 --> 47:36.800
doing serious work.

47:36.800 --> 47:38.320
You've got a lot of stuff going on in the system.

47:38.320 --> 47:40.400
Or you're just trying to run a bunch of virtual machines.

47:40.400 --> 47:44.320
Or you're like, Wes, and you just run out of RAM for a week, and your whole OS is in

47:44.320 --> 47:46.400
RAM, and everything you do is in RAM.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.480
It really enables my bad behavior.

47:48.480 --> 47:49.440
It's great.

47:49.920 --> 47:56.000
There is a niggling issue still, which is shameful it hasn't been fixed fully, with

47:56.000 --> 48:00.560
how the 480 handles thermal throttling under Linux.

48:00.560 --> 48:05.360
And it's an unfortunate issue, because if you fix it with the workarounds, the laptop

48:05.360 --> 48:06.880
runs noticeably warmer.

48:06.880 --> 48:09.440
And the fans run more often, and it becomes annoying.

48:09.440 --> 48:12.720
But if you don't fix it, you're robbed of performance.

48:12.720 --> 48:16.880
You've got two bad options when it comes to the T480 and thermal throttling.

48:16.880 --> 48:20.880
I don't know if with later revisions that's been solved, but I can tell you that the firmware

48:20.880 --> 48:23.520
updates that we were told would solve it did not solve it.

48:23.520 --> 48:24.320
And we can test it.

48:24.320 --> 48:27.120
We can, we can verifiably prove it.

48:27.120 --> 48:29.440
I'm trying to remember what we did semi-recently, Wes.

48:29.440 --> 48:36.640
You remember that encoding trick we did where, like, the 2015 MacBook kicked the hell out

48:36.640 --> 48:41.520
of it, but at first, on our T480s, just, like, shamed it on an encoding test?

48:41.520 --> 48:42.480
Oh, yeah.

48:42.480 --> 48:46.560
And it came down to the thermal throttling on the T480 was kicking into aggressively

48:46.560 --> 48:48.960
and reducing the overall speed.

48:48.960 --> 48:53.120
And so that older MacBook, until it heated up, was winning.

48:53.120 --> 48:54.800
And then once the MacBook started heating up...

48:54.800 --> 48:56.880
Once they were both throttling, right?

48:56.880 --> 48:57.280
Yeah.

48:57.280 --> 49:00.800
The super aggressive throttling kicked in on the MacBook, and then the T480 pulled ahead.

49:00.800 --> 49:04.160
But meanwhile, the XPS 13 never missed a beat.

49:04.160 --> 49:07.680
It remained consistently performant in our test.

49:07.680 --> 49:12.480
That was unfortunate because, you know, here we are, like a couple of jerks with our T480s,

49:12.480 --> 49:16.080
and they're getting stomped by a MacBook from 2015.

49:16.080 --> 49:17.360
Embarrassing.

49:17.360 --> 49:17.860
Yeah.

49:19.040 --> 49:20.720
So there are fixes out there.

49:20.720 --> 49:23.840
And that encoding test we did was after my firmware fix was installed.

49:23.840 --> 49:26.320
And I was still disappointed with the arrangement they'd came to.

49:26.320 --> 49:29.840
And I don't know if they were just adjusting things and maybe it'll get better, but...

49:29.840 --> 49:32.720
Yeah, the firmware has been kind of annoying in general.

49:32.720 --> 49:35.520
You know, there's also we ran into issues with the Thunderbolt controller,

49:35.520 --> 49:37.520
where you had to do an upgrade.

49:37.520 --> 49:39.920
Otherwise, you might eventually break your system.

49:39.920 --> 49:45.040
The nice part about that is that, you know, it works splendidly with FWAP-D.

49:45.040 --> 49:45.840
That's true.

49:45.840 --> 49:46.480
Good point.

49:46.480 --> 49:46.800
It does.

49:46.800 --> 49:48.960
It's really easy to get the firmware updates.

49:48.960 --> 49:53.360
So Drew, you ended up with one of these T480s, and I think you got the same unit, didn't you?

49:54.000 --> 49:56.400
Because you came on a little bit after Wes and I,

49:56.400 --> 49:58.640
and I don't remember if you got the same exact model or not.

49:58.640 --> 50:02.320
Yeah, I've got the Core i7 T480.

50:02.320 --> 50:05.680
And it's been a pretty good machine for me.

50:05.680 --> 50:10.640
I do have a couple of small things that I have noticed about it.

50:10.640 --> 50:12.800
With the thermal throttling,

50:12.800 --> 50:17.040
I've noticed that it has been better when I've been doing pro audio work

50:17.040 --> 50:19.920
than it had been in the past, but it's still not great.

50:20.880 --> 50:27.680
I've always been a little suspicious of putting something so hot as an i7 in a laptop.

50:27.680 --> 50:30.880
And this has been kind of proving me right.

50:30.880 --> 50:34.960
Now, one thing that I did do that helped immensely

50:34.960 --> 50:40.720
is I replaced all of the thermal paste on the CPU in the ThinkPad itself

50:40.720 --> 50:42.720
with some higher quality thermal paste.

50:42.720 --> 50:45.520
And that did improve things quite a bit.

50:45.520 --> 50:48.080
And that was even before the firmware fix came out.

50:49.360 --> 50:53.600
That might be why I'm having a little bit better luck than you are

50:53.600 --> 50:59.360
with my thermal throttling fix is just they use cheap paste in the stock configuration.

50:59.360 --> 51:02.560
Now, the biggest problem that I have

51:02.560 --> 51:06.640
is I can't have the laptop in the booth with me while I'm recording

51:06.640 --> 51:14.080
because even when it's running at its lowest possible heat and everything else,

51:14.080 --> 51:17.840
the fan is still too loud for me as a pro audio engineer.

51:17.840 --> 51:23.680
It just annoys me to no end how loud that fan is at idle.

51:23.680 --> 51:28.240
And I actually keep it outside of my booth and run an external monitor

51:28.240 --> 51:33.040
and keyboard and a Bluetooth mouse just to avoid that issue entirely.

51:33.040 --> 51:33.600
Good man.

51:34.320 --> 51:38.640
Like if I had to do it over again, I think I'd go with something a little quieter,

51:38.640 --> 51:41.600
you know, maybe something that's even fanless.

51:41.600 --> 51:46.560
Because my main thing with this is recording and then simple editing.

51:47.120 --> 51:49.440
I don't need a super high powered machine for that.

51:50.240 --> 51:55.040
Most of my actual renders and stuff I can do on higher powered machines.

51:55.040 --> 51:58.240
I think that's my one big thing is just it's kind of noisy.

51:58.240 --> 52:04.960
Yep, I am talking to you right now on a Pinebook because of that very issue is

52:04.960 --> 52:10.960
the Pinebook doesn't make noise and it's slow and it's not nearly as nice to use,

52:10.960 --> 52:14.560
I would say, as my ThinkPad just because of the overall performance difference.

52:14.560 --> 52:21.360
But it's silent and I mean, right now my microphone is hovering over the keyboard.

52:21.840 --> 52:23.040
It's right above the keyboard.

52:23.040 --> 52:27.360
So if the fans were going crazy in my ThinkPad or just making constant noise,

52:27.360 --> 52:28.560
it would be getting picked up.

52:28.560 --> 52:30.640
And that has been a problem.

52:30.640 --> 52:34.880
I don't find it to be a huge issue for me unless I'm really in a kind of a cramped

52:34.880 --> 52:38.240
setup where my microphone is right next to the laptop.

52:38.240 --> 52:43.200
I have kind of compensated too for some of the shortcomings of the ThinkPad by using

52:43.200 --> 52:44.800
an eGPU as well.

52:44.800 --> 52:50.800
So I think that's extended the life of the ThinkPad for me because I have a eGPU with

52:50.800 --> 52:54.560
um, it's an AMD graphics card and it's not a great one anymore.

52:54.560 --> 52:59.760
I want to say it's an AMD like 580, I could be wrong, might be even less, might be like

52:59.760 --> 53:06.240
like a cheap 570 or something, but I can plug that in and it acts as a dock.

53:06.800 --> 53:08.640
It's not a dock technically.

53:08.640 --> 53:14.080
I got the Mantis eGPU case and it has gigabit ethernet.

53:14.080 --> 53:21.280
It has a SATA adapter too so you can have storage in the dock and then it has a full

53:21.280 --> 53:23.840
array of ports, USB and all that kind of stuff.

53:23.840 --> 53:29.440
And so I plug that in just as a matter of course and then I selectively execute applications

53:29.440 --> 53:30.720
on that GPU.

53:30.720 --> 53:35.680
I launch a terminal, I set the environment variable to use GPU one instead of zero because

53:35.680 --> 53:41.280
zero is the Intel GPU and then I launched the application and any application I launch

53:41.280 --> 53:46.400
in that terminal session, once that environment variable is set, launches on the eGPU.

53:47.200 --> 53:53.120
This is so much better than how Windows and Mac OS handle eGPUs and it's kind of what

53:53.120 --> 53:54.720
System76 is working towards.

53:54.720 --> 53:58.080
We talked to them recently about it and it's, it's the way to go.

53:58.080 --> 54:02.320
I have a big GPU for when I need it and then I just otherwise run everything off of the

54:02.320 --> 54:09.760
Intel GPU and I have found that to be a pretty solid setup and it remains my primary workflow

54:09.760 --> 54:11.680
for the ThinkPad at home today.

54:11.680 --> 54:17.840
And then while I'm in the studio I have two different Thunderbolt docks which are ridiculously

54:17.840 --> 54:20.320
stupid expensive and I hate it.

54:20.320 --> 54:22.400
Wes, you see one there, right?

54:22.400 --> 54:23.680
What is the brand on that one?

54:23.680 --> 54:24.960
I can't even remember.

54:24.960 --> 54:26.240
OWC.

54:26.240 --> 54:27.920
Oh, is that Other World Computing?

54:27.920 --> 54:29.600
Yes, that's where I got it from.

54:29.600 --> 54:34.320
I got it from Other World Computing because they seem to make the best dock with the most

54:34.320 --> 54:36.240
port options and all that stuff.

54:36.240 --> 54:41.760
And so I have one in the studio and I have one up at my desk upstairs and I just move

54:41.760 --> 54:42.800
between them.

54:42.800 --> 54:47.360
I have my monitors hooked up to that now and I have my ethernet hooked up to that and that

54:47.360 --> 54:48.400
works really well for me.

54:48.400 --> 54:53.200
And I'm kind of just in a way getting myself ready for a pure USB-C lifestyle ahead of

54:53.200 --> 54:54.240
time.

54:54.240 --> 54:56.800
I don't think I'll get another ThinkPad.

54:56.800 --> 55:00.320
I think my next machine will be probably something different but I'm not at that point yet.

55:00.320 --> 55:02.160
And that's just because I want to try other things.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.800
Maybe there will be a ThinkPad that catches my attention.

55:04.800 --> 55:10.080
That new Oryx Pro from System76 is pretty high on my list right now, I have to be pretty

55:10.080 --> 55:10.880
honest.

55:10.880 --> 55:13.920
But I wanted to get to a lightning round just to cover a couple more things.

55:13.920 --> 55:18.080
Joshua wrote in and I wanted to recap on what the hell's going on with the Debian project.

55:18.080 --> 55:19.120
Dang it.

55:19.120 --> 55:21.680
Because I had raised some concerns on Linux Action News.

55:21.680 --> 55:24.400
Well, the Debian project leader elections wrapped up.

55:24.400 --> 55:26.000
Jonathan Carter won.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.160
He has been the Debian project leader since April, I believe.

55:30.160 --> 55:38.160
I've noted that recently Debian chatter seems to be, well, A, it's spread across many, many,

55:38.160 --> 55:38.960
many lists.

55:38.960 --> 55:40.720
I'll link you the complete index.

55:40.720 --> 55:41.520
Right?

55:41.520 --> 55:43.040
Can you believe that list, Wes?

55:43.040 --> 55:44.560
Ooh.

55:44.560 --> 55:49.840
But still, with all those mailing lists, it seems that certain conversations may be happening

55:49.840 --> 55:53.520
in other places, not in the public from what I can tell.

55:53.520 --> 55:58.960
But what I have noticed is that Jonathan Carter himself has a blog.

55:58.960 --> 56:02.720
And it doesn't get updated all the time, but he does a pretty good job of posting over

56:02.720 --> 56:03.440
there.

56:03.440 --> 56:06.480
So if you want to see where he's at, you can check out his blog.

56:06.480 --> 56:08.480
I'll have that linked in the show notes.

56:08.480 --> 56:11.600
And he has some good stuff in there, including what's going on with the Debian project.

56:11.600 --> 56:14.960
A little mini DebConf updates and whatnots are in there.

56:14.960 --> 56:21.120
And then additionally, speaking of conferences, DebConf 20 this year has moved to online, which

56:21.120 --> 56:21.920
everything has.

56:21.920 --> 56:25.680
And it's happening August 23rd through the 29th.

56:25.680 --> 56:28.800
And it's going to be a shorter conference.

56:28.800 --> 56:30.800
They're going to do DebCamp and DebConf.

56:30.800 --> 56:34.960
But maybe more of us will have a chance to attend now that it's online.

56:34.960 --> 56:40.400
The flip side is these online conferences are kind of a shadow of the in-person event.

56:40.400 --> 56:42.960
However, more of us can attend.

56:42.960 --> 56:44.560
So it's also kind of great.

56:44.560 --> 56:46.160
So I'm hoping we'll be able to attend.

56:46.160 --> 56:48.720
They currently have the call for papers open.

56:48.720 --> 56:50.880
So we'll have a link to that in the show notes too.

56:50.880 --> 56:52.560
And DebConf 20 will be going online.

56:52.560 --> 56:57.040
And I hope from that we'll be getting a more clear picture of how Debian is doing.

56:57.040 --> 57:00.800
I think one of the things that will really tell us is when there's a big decision that

57:00.800 --> 57:06.320
has to get made, something that really affects the project and requires them coming together

57:06.320 --> 57:09.520
and having a civil discourse on how to proceed.

57:09.520 --> 57:10.720
That will be the test.

57:10.720 --> 57:14.400
But Jonathan's leadership so far seems to be steady, open.

57:14.400 --> 57:20.320
And I think he's, from what initial kind of ways I can tell, it seems like he's doing

57:20.320 --> 57:21.360
a pretty good job.

57:21.360 --> 57:25.600
And I'll link to some of those things that you can read more about.

57:25.600 --> 57:30.960
Also, Joshua asked if we ever ended up installing those minimal distros that we used in our

57:30.960 --> 57:32.240
small distro bake-off.

57:32.240 --> 57:36.480
And I'm happy to report that, yep, my VM distro is now Sparky.

57:36.480 --> 57:42.400
I just have a Linux VM on every machine, even if it's a Linux box, that is sort of

57:42.400 --> 57:44.400
like a playground where I can go in and try stuff.

57:44.400 --> 57:49.680
In the past, I had used just my machine to just trash it, install stuff for the show.

57:49.680 --> 57:54.960
Then when I switched to Fedora for a while, I discovered Fedora Toolbox, which is awesome.

57:54.960 --> 57:59.760
And it was a game changer for how I decided to experiment with software.

57:59.760 --> 58:03.840
When I moved away from Fedora, I didn't want to go back to just trashing up my system.

58:03.840 --> 58:07.520
And so I went with a dedicated tester VM.

58:07.520 --> 58:12.080
And I like that Sparky's Debian-based for this very reason, because it gives me kind

58:12.080 --> 58:14.160
of a, I don't know, how would you describe it?

58:14.160 --> 58:14.880
Because it's not-

58:14.880 --> 58:15.840
It's a leg up.

58:15.840 --> 58:17.680
Yeah, it's not a boon to, it's not arch.

58:17.680 --> 58:21.040
I know, it's like it's slightly different, but it's not too far off the mainstream.

58:21.040 --> 58:22.000
Does that make sense?

58:22.000 --> 58:24.560
It's like, it just, it's a good test distro for me.

58:24.560 --> 58:28.480
Yeah, it has some of its own uniqueness, but at the end of the day, there's apt underneath

58:28.480 --> 58:30.160
and you know what you're doing on the command line.

58:30.160 --> 58:35.120
Another question that came in, did we ever end up installing i3 on the streaming rig

58:35.120 --> 58:36.720
like we said we'd consider it?

58:37.200 --> 58:43.440
And I don't think we tried it on the streaming rig, but we did try i3 in the studio for a

58:43.440 --> 58:43.920
bit.

58:43.920 --> 58:48.000
And I think we did a live stream of me experimenting with Regolith for a little bit.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
And then we thought about putting it on the Reaper machine.

58:50.480 --> 58:54.640
Ultimately, on the streaming machine, we've stuck with plasma and Kwin rules.

58:54.640 --> 59:00.080
And then on the recording machine, we've stuck with XFCE, but that's just because we

59:00.080 --> 59:02.080
haven't reloaded that box and it works.

59:02.080 --> 59:05.040
Right, I don't, I don't think we would go XFCE again, maybe.

59:05.040 --> 59:09.280
It hasn't been bad, but it's, I think it is missing a couple niceties that would go a

59:09.280 --> 59:09.840
long way.

59:09.840 --> 59:13.920
I would be very curious to see how that new pop shell did on the recording machine because

59:13.920 --> 59:18.640
we've got a lot of tiled windows, but some of the applications we use, especially like

59:18.640 --> 59:21.680
software to control a mixer, sort of random apps like that.

59:21.680 --> 59:23.040
Well, they don't always play nice.

59:23.040 --> 59:24.240
They've got weird floated windows.

59:24.240 --> 59:29.040
They don't perfectly fit with a tiling thing, but I think maybe a hybrid environment could

59:29.040 --> 59:30.240
find the right balance.

59:30.240 --> 59:34.640
When Wes said that XFCE hasn't been perfect for us, that's been kind of one of the problems

59:34.640 --> 59:39.040
is we run these weird apps like X32 edit, which is a little bit different.

59:39.040 --> 59:44.880
X32 edit by Barringer for our mixer is just not a common Linux app.

59:44.880 --> 59:47.520
No, and it's not using regular toolkits or anything.

59:47.520 --> 59:48.960
Yeah, it's very important to us.

59:48.960 --> 59:53.760
It's very important to us, but at the same time, it's like most Linux desktop environments

59:53.760 --> 59:55.440
don't know what to do with the window of it.

59:55.440 --> 59:56.880
They just, they can't figure it out.

59:56.880 --> 59:58.480
It doesn't have any traditional borders.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.440
It's just totally perplexing.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:06.560
And then additionally, when you have multiple monitors under XFCE, it seems like some of

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.080
the applications we run like Reaper, for example, which again, love Reaper.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.800
But it's weird in this one way in that it just opens up dialog windows on what seemingly

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.640
seems random or maybe not random.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.120
It's just whatever monitor you're not presently using.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:22.480
It's almost guaranteed to be the monitor that you don't think it should be on.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:22.800
I know.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.000
And then you're sitting there like, well, why is this application not responding?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:26.560
What's going on?

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.440
Why did it freeze?

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.160
What's happening?

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:28.960
Yes, yes.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.960
And then you look, oh, oh, there's a yes, no dialog on another screen somewhere.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.840
And that's where XFCE hasn't been ideal.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:41.120
And we kind of speculated that i3 might be better, but we don't know yet.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.520
And we will have a link to the i3 live stream in the show notes, as always, if you'd like

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:46.960
to catch that, if you missed it before.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.680
Wes, where do they find those handy show notes?

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.720
LinuxUnplugged.com slash 362.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.280
You got it.

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:53.840
You got it.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.160
All right.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.280
So that's batch one.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.720
We want to do this from time to time.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.520
We like following up on the stuff that we talked about because I think some of the most

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.080
valuable reviews are the ones after you've used them for a while.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:06.560
So if you've got other things you'd like us to follow up on in a future episode, send

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:06.800
them in.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.200
Go to LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.000
We need your help.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:10.400
That's right.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.120
Or you could tweet me.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.480
That's how this whole thing kicked off.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.920
I'm at Chris Lass.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.720
Wes, what about you?

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:15.920
At Wes Payne.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.440
Drew, Cheese, you guys, you online?

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.320
You on the Twitters?

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.520
At Cheese Bacon.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.720
I'm at Drew of Doom.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.920
Holy smokes.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.120
How about that?

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.080
Oh, yeah, I follow you.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:24.560
I knew that.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:29.440
Well, you can also follow this show at Linux Unplugged and the network at Jupiter Signal.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.200
Now, we will be back soon.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:33.600
Actually, by the time you're hearing this, we'll be back at our regular time.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.920
So you can just join us Tuesday or go to LinuxUnplugged.com slash subscribe and get it

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.800
every single week.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:02:02.000
See you next Tuesday.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:26.640
Oh, I ran out during the music and turned on the AC again because this place I'm at

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.720
doesn't run on the weekends.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.800
So it's 87 degrees in the studio right now.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.120
Chris, how in the world did you manage to last an hour and a half like that?

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.240
Well, he's not wearing many clothes right now.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.160
They got an override mode on the old air conditioning, but it only lasts for an hour.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:45.600
So it resets to whatever the schedule is after an hour.

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:49.600
So wait, Chris, were you a melting for the last 30 minutes?

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.920
Oh, at least because we were we took like 45 minutes in the you know, before we got

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.680
started just chatting.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.960
Ultimate pre-show.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.280
Yeah, it was pretty much just right at the top of the show.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.280
I'm oh, hey, guys, just a little visual.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.000
My back is like Niagara Falls right now.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.240
Let's just put it that way.

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:36.720
Oh, Jesus, Chris.
