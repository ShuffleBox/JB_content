WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.760
Isn't this news of Nvidia nerfing the RTX 3060 for crypto miners just sort of the warning

00:06.760 --> 00:12.960
shot that really should be telling us open source drivers matter and open video hardware

00:12.960 --> 00:18.680
might even be more important because Nvidia is going to just artificially limit the capabilities

00:18.680 --> 00:20.600
of these cards via their driver.

00:20.600 --> 00:26.040
And I mean, no love lost here, no tears for the miners, but boy, this just grades on a

00:26.040 --> 00:27.040
nerve of mine.

00:27.040 --> 00:28.040
Yeah, it's interesting.

00:28.040 --> 00:31.520
I love that they're trying to help gamers out and I think part of the idea here is right

00:31.520 --> 00:35.240
now miners are the ones with the money because they're trying to make a buck off, you know,

00:35.240 --> 00:36.860
mining Ethereum or whatever.

00:36.860 --> 00:40.080
And so they're just paying all the high prices grabbing all the stock that exists.

00:40.080 --> 00:45.200
So if you create an artificial version that is just for gamers, okay, maybe that leaves

00:45.200 --> 00:51.080
a little supply for some gamers, maybe, but you know what's going to happen.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.960
You'll have the miners that will just buy up the gaming cards and they'll have a hack

00:54.960 --> 00:56.800
driver in under a month.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.960
Well, you know, Nvidia addressed that and wrote that apparently there's a key handshake

01:00.960 --> 01:07.200
between the driver, the RTX 3060 and the BIOS that prevents removal of the hash rate limiter.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
So it might be a challenge.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.780
Oh, that'll do it.

01:09.780 --> 01:12.120
Until somebody just figures out how to put a Raspberry Pi in the middle and pull the

01:12.120 --> 01:15.120
whole thing off anyways.

01:15.120 --> 01:25.840
Hey there, good looking and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

01:25.840 --> 01:26.840
My name is Chris.

01:26.840 --> 01:27.840
My name is Wes.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.000
Hello, Wes.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.400
Coming up on today's episode of the unplugged program, we're going to tell you how we have

01:33.400 --> 01:36.920
managed to stick it out with Linux over the years.

01:36.920 --> 01:41.560
I mean, at least once, maybe sometimes more, you get tempted by the fruit of another.

01:41.560 --> 01:45.840
Well, listener John wrote into the show with a problem that's forcing him to consider dropping

01:45.840 --> 01:47.260
Linux entirely.

01:47.260 --> 01:52.720
So we'll share some hard learned wisdom on our part with him and some practical tools

01:52.720 --> 01:55.080
to actually pull the whole thing off.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.220
So that's coming up in the show.

01:56.220 --> 02:00.920
But of course, we also have community news and a lot more to get into.

02:00.920 --> 02:06.280
But first, we got to mod load up our virtual lug and say time appropriate greetings, Mumble

02:06.280 --> 02:07.280
Room.

02:07.280 --> 02:08.280
Hello, everyone.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.280
Well, hello.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.280
Hello.

02:10.280 --> 02:15.760
You know, you guys, every time you manage to make me giggle and I don't know how, because

02:15.760 --> 02:19.200
you know, I know it's coming, but you still make me smile.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.200
Thank you for being here.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.160
We've had a little bit of connectivity issues today.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.080
We don't know what's going on.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.840
So appreciate you guys sticking it out with us.

02:26.840 --> 02:34.200
It's kind of ironic because this week otherwise has been one of the coolest Linux production

02:34.200 --> 02:38.400
achievement weeks for Wes and I in maybe about a year.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.880
I mean, we have we're really flying on high cloud right now with Linux.

02:42.880 --> 02:48.520
We are experiencing like a whole new revolution in tools for Linux and audio production.

02:48.520 --> 02:53.200
And we're going to talk about some of that today, some new tech and just stuff that people

02:53.200 --> 02:55.960
are working on for a little bit that's finally being realized and it's all kind of coming

02:55.960 --> 02:58.040
together to make something special.

02:58.040 --> 03:03.120
So connectivity issues aside, we've actually had a really, really solid week for Linux.

03:03.120 --> 03:08.720
I mean, besides Wes and I and our our accomplishments that we'll share in a little bit, Linux also

03:08.720 --> 03:13.460
made it to Mars in the last week since we all got together.

03:13.460 --> 03:17.480
And I think a lot of us have been geeking out about Linux landing on Mars.

03:17.480 --> 03:21.860
And we covered it a little bit in a recent episode of Linux Action News.

03:21.860 --> 03:26.920
But if you've caught stuff since that episode, you may have caught that there was more Linux

03:26.920 --> 03:32.080
and open source involved than has been widely reported during the Monday public unveiling

03:32.080 --> 03:37.080
of the landing footage of the Mars rover, which was legitimately awesome.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.080
Amazing.

03:38.080 --> 03:47.000
In there, the NASA officials actually thanked open source and even name dropped FFmpeg directly.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.640
I grabbed a few seconds of that stream for you.

03:49.640 --> 03:54.600
It's not perfect audio because they were having some packet loss in their stream at the time,

03:54.600 --> 03:56.800
ironically, but I still wanted you to hear it.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.320
And I want to add one more thing I wanted to mention about the camera technology and

04:00.320 --> 04:02.400
then this data.

04:02.400 --> 04:06.560
We haven't mentioned it, but in addition to use commercial cameras, we're using a commercial

04:06.560 --> 04:11.360
computer and Intel based PC that's running Linux open source.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.040
So it's the first open source, at least that I know of, open source Linux box running on

04:15.040 --> 04:17.160
the surface of Mars, actually inside the rover.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.120
It's quite compact.

04:19.120 --> 04:24.560
And so there's the Linux operating system and we compress the video using FFmpeg, which

04:24.560 --> 04:25.860
is another open source tool.

04:25.860 --> 04:31.160
So thank you to the open source community for allowing us to use your amazing software.

04:31.160 --> 04:35.480
In fact, there really is quite a bit of Linux and open source software making this mission

04:35.480 --> 04:36.480
possible.

04:36.480 --> 04:41.120
And if that's the kind of thing that interests you, well, definitely check out episode 177

04:41.120 --> 04:45.960
of Linux Action News, because we've got some exclusive details about the open source software

04:45.960 --> 04:48.840
powering multiple aspects of the mission hardware.

04:48.840 --> 04:54.600
Yeah, it's not just Linux on the copter or on the landing system, but there's also a

04:54.600 --> 04:59.240
lot of open source that's helping both systems do local processing.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.420
And it was the highlight of my week.

05:00.420 --> 05:06.200
We got to chat with the operations lead of the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars and he gave

05:06.200 --> 05:09.000
us some of the Linux details and hardware details.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.240
And that is in Linux Action News 177.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.100
If you haven't caught that one, it's pretty historic.

05:14.100 --> 05:16.440
It's pretty historic that Linux helped them achieve something.

05:16.440 --> 05:20.600
Linux and the open source software that was running on Linux helped them achieve something

05:20.600 --> 05:26.080
historic like that and kind of awesome that it crosses over with our area.

05:26.080 --> 05:31.460
And then that this individual at JPL took the time out of his schedule when they're

05:31.460 --> 05:36.720
probably pretty busy right now to answer questions for Linux Action News.

05:36.720 --> 05:37.720
Really wonderful.

05:37.720 --> 05:38.720
It was pretty great.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.840
Wes and I were geeking out pretty, pretty good.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.000
And now it just gets better as we wait for more and more awesome pictures and videos

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
to come back from Mars.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.800
Yep, that Linux Copter will be flying in a few months.

05:49.800 --> 05:54.600
And the system we talk about in that episode is what will be powering that flight.

05:54.600 --> 06:00.180
And back here on Earth, the open build service from the SUSE folks is announcing that they

06:00.180 --> 06:07.760
are introducing Flatpak support into the build service, which is brilliant.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.680
And really, you don't have to do much.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.080
They have a quick start guide.

06:12.080 --> 06:16.740
Even if you've never built a Flatpak app, they say you can quickly get started by branching

06:16.740 --> 06:18.340
their template package.

06:18.340 --> 06:21.600
For a successful Flatpak build, you're going to need four things.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.840
The project configuration, which you can get in that template, the project meta configuration,

06:25.840 --> 06:30.160
oh yeah, a Flatpak manifest file, Flatpak.yaml.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.040
You knew there was going to be a yaml file here somewhere, right?

06:33.040 --> 06:36.600
And then, of course, whatever sources you're using in the form of a bunch of tar archives.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.880
But once you've got that, you're on your way to making a Flatpak.

06:39.880 --> 06:45.640
I don't think this replaces FlatHub necessarily, but I guess it gets you the Flatpak, then

06:45.640 --> 06:48.080
you could turn around and publish on FlatHub.

06:48.080 --> 06:53.000
I wonder if this is going to have interesting ramifications for Flatpak's adoption.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.200
Neil, do you have any thoughts on this being rolled out for the open build service?

06:57.200 --> 06:58.200
Yeah.

06:58.200 --> 07:02.880
So I've taken a gander at the functionality and looked at it a bit.

07:02.880 --> 07:09.880
So what it basically does is provide a way to run Flatpak Builder in the build service

07:09.880 --> 07:14.800
environment depending against the normal runtimes and things like that.

07:14.800 --> 07:19.860
But at the moment, they don't have a way of handling OS trees inside of the open SUSE

07:19.860 --> 07:20.860
build service.

07:20.860 --> 07:27.540
So without that piece, it's almost impossible right now to actually correctly publish Flatpaks

07:27.540 --> 07:28.600
and such.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.440
It actually takes a different approach from how Fedora has done this.

07:31.440 --> 07:36.760
So for those who may not be aware, Fedora is also capable of building and publishing

07:36.760 --> 07:37.760
Flatpaks.

07:37.760 --> 07:38.820
Well, publishing is the important part.

07:38.820 --> 07:41.640
We can actually publish Flatpaks.

07:41.640 --> 07:46.760
Fedora's technology works off of constructing its own runtime using the RPMs that make up

07:46.760 --> 07:48.080
the Fedora distribution.

07:48.080 --> 07:55.120
And then for applications, we use the Fedora modularity building tool chain to construct

07:55.120 --> 08:01.000
using the existing spec files for various packages and constructing a Flatpak build

08:01.000 --> 08:05.660
out of that and shipping that as an OCI container bundle.

08:05.660 --> 08:10.880
So they publish to the container registry on registry.fedoraproject.org.

08:10.880 --> 08:18.840
That registry can be used as a substitute for an OS tree remote to actually fetch Flatpaks

08:18.840 --> 08:20.160
and run them.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.980
And so that's how we've been shipping Flatpaks in Fedora.

08:22.980 --> 08:26.940
And I think this is actually one of those steps for open SUSE to get there to be able

08:26.940 --> 08:32.520
to build and release Flatpaks built on their own runtime using their own trusted inputs

08:32.520 --> 08:37.840
and making it so that it becomes more accessible to ship software as Flatpaks.

08:37.840 --> 08:42.720
So this is where I was going with it is do you think long term, I mean, a couple of years

08:42.720 --> 08:48.240
down the road, we could see some of the desktop applications on a SUSE desktop or the open

08:48.240 --> 08:51.480
SUSE desktop packaged as Flatpaks instead of RPMs?

08:51.480 --> 08:52.480
I think so.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.440
Yeah, I'm sure you've kind of seen this.

08:54.440 --> 08:59.600
But for those who may be a little less familiar, there's an open SUSE, a micro OS, which is

08:59.600 --> 09:05.960
a minimal platform that you can use for single purpose workloads or specialized workloads

09:05.960 --> 09:06.960
and things like that.

09:06.960 --> 09:10.400
That's a rolling but stable platform built on Tumbleweed.

09:10.400 --> 09:16.360
There's also now a micro OS desktop, which lets you do this by your single purpose being

09:16.360 --> 09:18.020
a desktop computer.

09:18.020 --> 09:22.360
And then applications would generally be shipped in the form of Flatpaks and layered on top

09:22.360 --> 09:24.400
of it that way.

09:24.400 --> 09:30.400
So yeah, we could totally see a future where, like Fedora with Silverblue and Kinoite, you

09:30.400 --> 09:34.480
will see micro OS desktop, Gnome and KDE doing the same thing.

09:34.480 --> 09:39.120
Yeah, Colonel, I see you joking in the chat room, but I think there's some seriousness.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.000
You're like, you're OK with this, but not if it's Snap.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.520
So we're OK with Flatpaks, Colonel, but but not Snap doing this.

09:45.520 --> 09:51.880
I'm fine if distros want to start shipping applications via Flatpak because the Flatpaks,

09:51.880 --> 09:57.160
especially on Fedora and I haven't used them on OpenSUSE, but at least in Fedora, they

09:57.160 --> 09:59.120
integrate in well.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.960
There's no real performance hit.

10:00.960 --> 10:05.000
And there are certain applications that I actually prefer to be in a Flatpak because

10:05.000 --> 10:09.420
it's proprietary software and I like that sandboxing around that.

10:09.420 --> 10:18.720
My issue with Snaps is that, A, they don't work well on distros that don't have app armored

10:18.720 --> 10:19.720
by default.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.420
They don't work well with SELinux.

10:22.420 --> 10:28.360
And the other issue I have with Snaps is that regardless of the distro, you're always talking

10:28.360 --> 10:29.360
back to Canonical.

10:29.360 --> 10:35.920
Well, OK, but isn't all of those concerns and complaints irrelevant if you're on Ubuntu

10:35.920 --> 10:40.880
because Ubuntu is already checking back with Canonical to check for updates.

10:40.880 --> 10:44.620
Ubuntu isn't going to have some of those integration issues because it will have app armor and

10:44.620 --> 10:47.200
all the components necessary to run Snaps.

10:47.200 --> 10:51.940
Isn't it sort of validating the idea that there is actually some utility in moving away

10:51.940 --> 10:56.840
from the distribution's core package manager, which by the way, not actually sure I agree

10:56.840 --> 10:57.840
with.

10:57.840 --> 11:01.980
But anyways, isn't other distributions attempting to do this with Flatpak sort of validating

11:01.980 --> 11:04.240
what Canonical tried to do early with Snaps?

11:04.240 --> 11:07.940
I think it really depends on that particular piece of software.

11:07.940 --> 11:12.960
If it's a piece of software that is either proprietary or it's a piece of software that

11:12.960 --> 11:18.140
pulls in proprietary components or it's a piece of software that's difficult to build

11:18.140 --> 11:24.040
and maintain for the distro, I think a containerized solution in that case makes sense.

11:24.040 --> 11:30.820
If it's something like Firefox or it's the desktop environment or it's something else

11:30.820 --> 11:36.820
that's either heavily integrated in with your user experience and the distro or it's very

11:36.820 --> 11:43.620
easily built and it's open source, I personally would prefer to have those maintained and

11:43.620 --> 11:44.620
in the repos.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.900
Yeah, I think that's how I fall down on it too, pretty much.

11:47.900 --> 11:53.700
Well it's an interesting development and I could see the utility of it for certain applications.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.880
Some that in the past maybe you had to add specific repos for and then install a bunch

11:56.880 --> 11:58.920
of dependencies.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.380
It remains a problem that needs a little bit of solving.

12:01.380 --> 12:05.660
As somebody who's been trying to make Fedora work kind of to some futility because I just

12:05.660 --> 12:09.900
can't get my hands on some software still, I appreciate this is not a problem that is

12:09.900 --> 12:14.740
fully solved by repositories alone and there needs to be some other solution in here.

12:14.740 --> 12:19.020
But while we're talking about Flatpaks, for you parents or maybe anybody out there who's

12:19.020 --> 12:26.620
a Minecraft fan, there's this Bedrock edition that Microsoft created that is basically a

12:26.620 --> 12:35.340
utopia of Microsoft components, ties in nicely with their store and Windows 10 and it's really

12:35.340 --> 12:40.460
one of those kind of transitions that for my kids has been extremely tempting.

12:40.460 --> 12:44.880
They traditionally use what is the standard version of Minecraft, the Java edition, which

12:44.880 --> 12:51.060
has a huge community, tons of mods, years of history, but Microsoft, they couldn't have

12:51.060 --> 12:52.060
that.

12:52.060 --> 12:54.140
Something about embracing and extending?

12:54.140 --> 12:55.140
I'm not sure.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.140
Yeah.

12:56.140 --> 13:00.020
So the Bedrock edition of Minecraft came along and that's sort of a rewrite of Minecraft

13:00.020 --> 13:04.300
with more integration with Microsoft technologies and surprise, surprise, there's no Linux

13:04.300 --> 13:06.100
version.

13:06.100 --> 13:11.980
And this has been a bit of a point of contention with my kids because they'd like to have access

13:11.980 --> 13:16.620
to it because a lot of their friends on their Windows 10 machines or whatever are playing

13:16.620 --> 13:17.620
it.

13:17.620 --> 13:21.820
And there isn't really any gaming stream service that offers it because it's a Microsoft game

13:21.820 --> 13:25.940
and there's no Microsoft gaming streaming service that offers this via the web browser

13:25.940 --> 13:26.980
right now.

13:26.980 --> 13:33.020
So I did not have a great answer until today when I was browsing Flathub and I saw that

13:33.020 --> 13:39.260
there is a Minecraft Bedrock launcher that you can download and play on Linux.

13:39.260 --> 13:44.900
And it's clever because it appears to be using the Android version of this game but running

13:44.900 --> 13:46.940
it on your Linux desktop.

13:46.940 --> 13:47.940
Clever indeed.

13:47.940 --> 13:48.940
Yeah.

13:48.940 --> 13:49.940
And it's early.

13:49.940 --> 13:51.020
It's a work in progress big time.

13:51.020 --> 13:55.460
There's still several ways to make it crash and all of that.

13:55.460 --> 14:01.200
But the author is continuing to update it and it's becoming the unofficial launcher

14:01.200 --> 14:03.860
for the Minecraft Bedrock code base.

14:03.860 --> 14:07.300
And they're not affiliated with Microsoft or anything like that but it shows real potential

14:07.300 --> 14:11.420
and it could be another one of those things that helps me keep the kiddos on Linux which

14:11.420 --> 14:16.540
I'm a big fan of because I hate for these silly app store games and stuff to be what

14:16.540 --> 14:20.100
draws my kids off of a free operating system.

14:20.100 --> 14:24.340
And it just sucks to have to also be on the other side and be like, well, I'm sorry, it

14:24.340 --> 14:25.580
just doesn't exist on Linux.

14:25.580 --> 14:26.580
Yeah.

14:26.580 --> 14:27.580
You can't have access to it.

14:27.580 --> 14:28.580
That must feel bad.

14:28.580 --> 14:32.460
Well, they see it as a deficiency in Linux because their friends, it's just their computer

14:32.460 --> 14:36.240
that has Windows on it and it just has this Microsoft store on it.

14:36.240 --> 14:40.420
So I will put a link to that in the show notes or you can just go on Flat Hub and search

14:40.420 --> 14:43.100
for Minecraft Bedrock Launcher and you'll find it over there.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.900
And I'm going to give it a go probably this week.

14:45.900 --> 14:50.660
So I'll find out how good it works I suppose and maybe I'll report back on it and see if

14:50.660 --> 14:52.820
I solve the problem for the kiddos.

14:52.820 --> 14:58.420
I think this whole topic was just an excuse so you could play more Minecraft.

14:58.420 --> 15:00.160
Linode dot com slash unplugged.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.740
Go there to receive a one hundred dollars, 60 day credit towards your new account and

15:03.740 --> 15:04.740
of course, support the show.

15:04.740 --> 15:07.500
It lets them know you heard about it here and it's kind of a way of saying, hey, thanks

15:07.500 --> 15:10.300
for supporting my weekly Linux talk show.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.280
Linode is the largest independent cloud right there.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.100
How awesome is that?

15:15.100 --> 15:17.060
Independent still after all these years.

15:17.060 --> 15:22.780
They started in 2003, which is basically before time, before the cloud.

15:22.780 --> 15:26.380
I mean, it's just forever ago because they're huge fans of Linux and they saw where things

15:26.380 --> 15:31.140
were going in the kernel and in the user space and they were able to build a company around

15:31.140 --> 15:32.140
that.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.700
Over the years, they've managed to refine it into a lean mean cloud hosting machine

15:35.700 --> 15:40.980
with native SSDs, 40 gigabit connections to the machines, revamped and easy to use cloud

15:40.980 --> 15:44.760
manager that's extremely competitive, fast and very reliable.

15:44.760 --> 15:49.420
They have an API that has a command line you can use, which you get really awesome when

15:49.420 --> 15:53.180
you're doing like the drop down terminal thing and you run the Linode command line tool in

15:53.180 --> 15:54.180
there.

15:54.180 --> 15:58.140
And that interaction with their object storage or for managing your servers, I mean, it's

15:58.140 --> 15:59.140
really great.

15:59.140 --> 16:06.660
And Linode costs 30 to 50% less than the major cloud providers like AWS or Google or Azure,

16:06.660 --> 16:09.460
which is great because they're an independent Linux company that's been around forever.

16:09.460 --> 16:11.820
You get a real good balance of technology and price.

16:11.820 --> 16:14.420
They have machines you can pick from that start at $5 a month.

16:14.420 --> 16:19.420
Of course, they have systems with lots of dedicated CPU and memory or GPU, kind of depends

16:19.420 --> 16:20.420
on what you need.

16:20.420 --> 16:24.820
They make it really easy to go through and pick and that's why that $100 credit is fricking

16:24.820 --> 16:28.580
great because you can really play around, see what works best for you.

16:28.580 --> 16:34.520
So go to linode.com slash unplugged, get that $100 60 day credit and try something out.

16:34.520 --> 16:40.100
And if you dig around on their site, you'll find some extremely useful utilities, guides,

16:40.100 --> 16:42.120
how tos, you know, all that kind of stuff.

16:42.120 --> 16:45.660
And one I'll throw a link to in the show notes because it was just updated a couple of days

16:45.660 --> 16:49.040
ago is the Linux system monitoring fundamentals.

16:49.040 --> 16:53.420
This is a great way to wrap your head around what might need to be monitored on a Linux

16:53.420 --> 16:54.420
system.

16:54.420 --> 16:58.460
What might be the best tool to collect that depending on what your needs are and get a

16:58.460 --> 17:00.280
good rundown of the entire thing.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.220
It's an example of an area that Linode is always investing in and we'll have a link

17:03.220 --> 17:07.180
to that in the show notes for the Linux system monitoring fundamentals that you can run through

17:07.180 --> 17:10.980
and get an idea of maybe what you could be looking at to properly monitor your Linux

17:10.980 --> 17:11.980
box.

17:11.980 --> 17:15.060
And of course, they build a lot of those analytics into the dashboard to give you a quick snapshot

17:15.060 --> 17:18.020
of that too and that's extremely useful as well.

17:18.020 --> 17:20.860
So go check them out, linode.com slash unplugged.

17:20.860 --> 17:24.940
Get that $100 60 day credit and a big thank you to everybody who does that and supports

17:24.940 --> 17:26.100
the show.

17:26.100 --> 17:30.140
It's what makes it possible for us to do this and for us to remain independent, linode.com

17:30.140 --> 17:34.620
slash unplugged.

17:34.620 --> 17:39.900
There is some big GNOME developments or GNOME developments this week.

17:39.900 --> 17:45.580
GNOME Shell and Mudder have hit a bit of a 40 version milestone with the beta being released

17:45.580 --> 17:47.600
and things really kind of coming together.

17:47.600 --> 17:52.780
If you can get your hands on the freshest builds of GNOME, you're going to see essentially

17:52.780 --> 17:57.380
the almost near final design for the new shell.

17:57.380 --> 17:58.780
It's getting real close.

17:58.780 --> 18:00.540
Oh, yeah.

18:00.540 --> 18:05.220
In GNOME Shell 40 beta, you'll see the redesign to the overview area.

18:05.220 --> 18:07.540
Out of date extensions are now disabled by default.

18:07.540 --> 18:12.400
Hey, that's nice to see because you don't want a busted and old extension plus a wide

18:12.400 --> 18:17.780
variety of fixes, just general bug fixes, but also some crash fixes.

18:17.780 --> 18:18.780
That's nice.

18:18.780 --> 18:19.780
Yeah, really, right?

18:19.780 --> 18:23.660
As for Mudder, well, it's now defaulting to starting X Wayland on demand.

18:23.660 --> 18:28.620
It gained support for atomic mode setting, improved touch mode heuristics, which that's

18:28.620 --> 18:34.260
nice too, and of course, defaulting to the horizontal workspace layout.

18:34.260 --> 18:38.540
Yeah, we're going to talk more about that.

18:38.540 --> 18:44.300
Alan Day over at the GNOME Shell and Mudder blog did a post just before the show started

18:44.300 --> 18:48.620
about the horizontal layout and the multi-monitor stuff.

18:48.620 --> 18:52.940
Stick with us here, guys, because we got to chew on this a little bit because as you know,

18:52.940 --> 18:57.300
these things tend to have lasting ramifications.

18:57.300 --> 19:02.780
I think it's important to note here that the development team for GNOME seems to be listening

19:02.780 --> 19:04.260
to what people are saying.

19:04.260 --> 19:09.600
Alan writes, multi-monitor has come up a fair bit in conversations about the GNOME Shell

19:09.600 --> 19:12.940
UI changes that are coming in GNOME 40.

19:12.940 --> 19:17.140
There has been uncertainty and anxiety in this area.

19:17.140 --> 19:18.620
I just don't think that's an overstatement.

19:18.620 --> 19:22.320
I think if you go back a few weeks and you hear my conversation with Carl, there is some

19:22.320 --> 19:27.500
anxiety in how multi-monitor users are going to use these new updates.

19:27.500 --> 19:32.740
So he goes on to say, so we wanted to provide more detail on what the multi-monitor experience

19:32.740 --> 19:36.540
will be exactly like so people know what to expect.

19:36.540 --> 19:43.100
Now, in many key respects, multi-monitor handling in GNOME 40 will be basically identical to

19:43.100 --> 19:45.580
how it is in 3.3.8.

19:45.580 --> 19:49.500
GNOME 40 still defaults to workspaces only on the primary display, as we've had since

19:49.500 --> 19:51.120
3.0.

19:51.120 --> 19:55.660
The top bar in overview will only be shown on the primary display and the number of workspaces

19:55.660 --> 19:57.540
will still be dynamic.

19:57.540 --> 20:03.380
So in many respects, GNOME 40 should feel very similar to previous GNOME versions.

20:03.380 --> 20:08.860
But there are still some changes and some unanswered questions about what exactly is

20:08.860 --> 20:09.860
changing.

20:09.860 --> 20:10.860
Yeah, and that's fair.

20:10.860 --> 20:14.360
And there are some good visuals that we'll have linked in this GNOME post.

20:14.360 --> 20:17.340
They tried to specifically illustrate what he's talking about.

20:17.340 --> 20:21.740
But the key here is, like Wes said, GNOME 40 will continue to default to only showing

20:21.740 --> 20:24.260
one workspace on the primary display.

20:24.260 --> 20:30.260
When we have a dual display setup, the overview on the other screen will be just that workspace.

20:30.260 --> 20:34.920
It'll zoom back like the primary display does, and it'll overview all of the screens.

20:34.920 --> 20:39.580
But that workspace on that second screen, that won't change.

20:39.580 --> 20:44.980
But they're making some tweaks in how it's displayed, and the team feels like that presentation,

20:44.980 --> 20:48.700
the tweaking they're doing, will help people understand with multiple displays how this

20:48.700 --> 20:49.700
works more clearly.

20:49.700 --> 20:54.100
Now, while workspaces only being on the primary display, as we mentioned, it's the default

20:54.100 --> 20:55.100
behavior.

20:55.100 --> 21:00.660
GNOME also supports having workspaces on all displays using the workspaces only on primary

21:00.660 --> 21:02.380
settings key.

21:02.380 --> 21:06.500
This is pretty similar to how workspaces work with just only on primary configuration, but

21:06.500 --> 21:11.980
the main difference is you can see the additional workspaces extending to the right on the secondary

21:11.980 --> 21:12.980
display.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.620
It's also possible to see that the workspace navigator, that small little set of thumbnails

21:16.620 --> 21:20.440
up at the top, that's now visible on both displays.

21:20.440 --> 21:24.540
It's a new change in GNOME 40, and it's intended to hopefully improve the experience for users

21:24.540 --> 21:27.180
to actually have workspaces on all displays.

21:27.180 --> 21:30.420
I think a few people have pointed out that horizontal workspaces aren't going to work

21:30.420 --> 21:31.480
for them.

21:31.480 --> 21:36.420
But if you think about it, it is how a lot of the desktop environments do it today already.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.860
It's sort of been kind of standard.

21:38.860 --> 21:42.780
And what I think needs to now be appreciated, and why we wanted to go through some of these

21:42.780 --> 21:47.900
details with you, is when GNOME 40 launches, it's going to be kind of controversial.

21:47.900 --> 21:49.980
There'll be different headlines about it.

21:49.980 --> 21:55.780
There'll be different hot takes on incumbent threads, and I think it should be reflected

21:55.780 --> 22:01.020
in that future conversation that the team listened and made some tweaks and even has

22:01.020 --> 22:04.260
some further adjustments they want to make long term.

22:04.260 --> 22:08.440
They say, in case there's any doubt, multi-monitor is absolutely a priority for us in the shell

22:08.440 --> 22:09.720
design team.

22:09.720 --> 22:13.380
We know that the multi-monitor experience is important to many GNOME users, including

22:13.380 --> 22:17.620
many of us who work on GNOME, and it's something that we're committed to improving.

22:17.620 --> 22:19.140
That's a commitment, right, from the top there.

22:19.140 --> 22:22.500
I think it's notable and should be considered in the future conversation.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.500
Yes.

22:23.500 --> 22:28.300
I think the other part here, too, as Alan mentions, is that we actually have a few plans

22:28.300 --> 22:32.860
for multi-monitor improvements in the future, and some of these predate the GNOME 40 work

22:32.860 --> 22:34.500
that's currently happening.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.140
So there's more in the pipeline.

22:36.140 --> 22:39.340
They're hoping to get back to that after all these GNOME 40 changes, but this isn't something

22:39.340 --> 22:41.960
new that they just started considering after the feedback.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.180
It's been there the whole time.

22:43.180 --> 22:47.300
And then just also in the new stuff department, something that we're going to be telling you

22:47.300 --> 22:49.300
more about soon, we have an update on that.

22:49.300 --> 22:55.340
And then my plan, too, by the way, is to switch to GNOME, win 40 launches, and give it an

22:55.340 --> 22:59.700
honest go for a bit, see how things go on the GNOME side for a while, because I've been

22:59.700 --> 23:03.240
living Plasma for a long time, I like it a lot, but I want to give this a fair shot.

23:03.240 --> 23:06.340
So when GNOME 40 lands, I'm going to make the switch for a bit.

23:06.340 --> 23:09.420
Not in protest, but because I want to.

23:09.420 --> 23:12.660
But something that I'm playing with right now, I don't have to wait around for, is pipe

23:12.660 --> 23:13.660
wire.

23:13.660 --> 23:17.660
It's getting really exciting, and Wes and I have had an opportunity to use it in a couple

23:17.660 --> 23:19.820
of scenarios now in production.

23:19.820 --> 23:24.660
And there's a new version that's just been released this week, with a lot of stuff landing,

23:24.660 --> 23:27.260
I think, Wes, to get it ready for Fedora 34.

23:27.260 --> 23:31.740
Yeah, PipeWire 0.3.22 was released this week.

23:31.740 --> 23:35.460
A whole lot of work, yeah, and a lot of that focused around making sure that Fedora 34

23:35.460 --> 23:40.020
can hopefully ship it as default this coming spring.

23:40.020 --> 23:43.940
Some of the highlights of this release are per-client configuration files, that's some

23:43.940 --> 23:49.940
nice customizability, support for pro audio cards, Bluetooth audio improvements, better

23:49.940 --> 23:57.300
sync, support for HFP, HF, that profile, and most notably for us, improvements in their

23:57.300 --> 23:58.300
jack support.

23:58.300 --> 24:01.460
So I think this is one of the funny things about PipeWire, is I think it gets talked

24:01.460 --> 24:07.220
a lot about as a jack replacement, but ironically, one of the things that Wes and I are finding

24:07.220 --> 24:13.340
best about PipeWire is how it plugs into existing jack tools and makes it even simpler and more

24:13.340 --> 24:16.500
reliable and easier in a lot of ways to use.

24:16.500 --> 24:20.300
It really unifies the desktop Linux audio scene.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.780
Suddenly you can use these jack tools with regular Pulse audio apps.

24:22.780 --> 24:26.460
You don't have to convert everything over, PipeWire brings them all together.

24:26.460 --> 24:27.940
It's been pretty exciting.

24:27.940 --> 24:32.020
And I'll save it because we have more to talk about on that front.

24:32.020 --> 24:37.180
We should probably wait and do our due diligence and do a little cleaning up around here.

24:37.180 --> 24:43.540
We do have some housekeeping, just a few things to let you know about to keep the show on

24:43.540 --> 24:44.540
the road.

24:44.540 --> 24:46.740
And that, and first and foremost is we love hearing from you.

24:46.740 --> 24:50.600
We love it when you can participate in the conversation outside just when the show is

24:50.600 --> 24:53.440
live or just when the show is released.

24:53.440 --> 24:57.560
That conversation, it's always rolling in our telegram group at jupiterbroadcasting.com

24:57.560 --> 24:58.860
slash telegram.

24:58.860 --> 25:02.500
And then additionally, check out the Luplug on Sunday.

25:02.500 --> 25:05.920
It goes down at noon Pacific, 3pm Eastern.

25:05.920 --> 25:11.300
On Sundays we have the details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble if you want to get connected.

25:11.300 --> 25:15.100
And I wanted to mention something about this.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.820
I'm not really a big social person.

25:17.820 --> 25:21.660
I don't generally go out and hang out at a bar and socialize.

25:21.660 --> 25:25.140
Generally when I'm off air, I kind of keep to myself.

25:25.140 --> 25:26.780
You're hiding away in the woods.

25:26.780 --> 25:27.780
Right.

25:27.780 --> 25:33.980
But I still get a lot of enjoyment and fulfillment out of attending the Luplug.

25:33.980 --> 25:37.260
It's nice to hang out with people who know what you're talking about and are excited

25:37.260 --> 25:39.500
about the same stuff you're excited about.

25:39.500 --> 25:43.700
And they always either have just a conversation that it's open and everybody can jump in or

25:43.700 --> 25:45.660
sometimes they have presentations happening too.

25:45.660 --> 25:47.200
Things are always in the works.

25:47.200 --> 25:51.540
So I encourage you to join on Sundays and we have that up on the calendar to get it

25:51.540 --> 25:55.680
in your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.980
Also over there on our website we have the all shows feed so you can subscribe and get

25:58.980 --> 25:59.980
all of those shows.

25:59.980 --> 26:04.060
We have some really great stuff in the works for Koda radio and self-hosted and of course

26:04.060 --> 26:08.100
we just mentioned a killer Linux action news that went out this week so why not make it

26:08.100 --> 26:09.100
easy on yourself.

26:09.100 --> 26:13.740
Get the all shows feed and then you just get everything in one solid feed.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.740
Mr. Payne is there anything else we need to clean up around here?

26:15.740 --> 26:17.820
No, looks pretty tidy to me.

26:17.820 --> 26:18.820
Thank you.

26:18.820 --> 26:19.820
Just set that bag over there.

26:19.820 --> 26:20.820
OK.

26:20.820 --> 26:21.820
Appreciate it.

26:21.820 --> 26:29.260
Let's take a moment and thank a Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode of Linux Unplugged

26:29.260 --> 26:32.620
and there is a special opportunity right now.

26:32.620 --> 26:36.020
You can save 20 percent on ACG's annual plans.

26:36.020 --> 26:40.420
20 percent when you use the promo code SPRINGINTOCLOUD21.

26:40.420 --> 26:41.420
All one word?

26:41.420 --> 26:42.420
But you know the cloud's growing.

26:42.420 --> 26:47.820
I mean we see it around us all the time and of course that means there's demand for skilled

26:47.820 --> 26:50.860
cloud professionals and that's increasing all the time.

26:50.860 --> 26:55.580
82 percent of hiring managers say that cloud certificates make a candidate more attractive

26:55.580 --> 26:56.780
for hiring.

26:56.780 --> 27:00.860
So maybe it's time to go keep modern, keep up to date and grow your skills and your career.

27:00.860 --> 27:04.860
Get 20 percent off the most effective and hands-on cloud learning.

27:04.860 --> 27:09.140
Keep up with change and develop the new skills you need at a Cloud Guru.

27:09.140 --> 27:18.380
So get 25 percent off, go to a cloudguru.com and use the annual promo code SPRINGINTOCLOUD21.

27:18.380 --> 27:22.580
Ninety-five percent of their learners say that their tools and content directly helped

27:22.580 --> 27:23.860
advance their career.

27:23.860 --> 27:25.340
Ninety-five percent.

27:25.340 --> 27:32.160
And you can get an annual plan for 20 percent off SPRINGINTOCLOUD21.

27:32.160 --> 27:37.400
We got an email into the show that we thought we should hold and maybe make into a wider

27:37.400 --> 27:43.060
conversation because it's a bigger question and the longer you use Linux the more opportunities

27:43.060 --> 27:46.340
you have to be tempted by the fruit of another.

27:46.340 --> 27:50.740
And so we thought let's have a conversation about how we stick with it.

27:50.740 --> 27:52.060
How do we manage to stick it out?

27:52.060 --> 27:53.060
Sometimes it's hard.

27:53.060 --> 27:54.060
Yeah.

27:54.060 --> 27:55.060
It takes work.

27:55.060 --> 27:56.060
It takes time.

27:56.060 --> 27:59.740
And so this email from John, listener John, came into the show and we realized it was

27:59.740 --> 28:04.100
really about two things.

28:04.100 --> 28:08.380
How do we stick with Linux on the long haul when we get tempted?

28:08.380 --> 28:12.420
And what's the current snapshot of media production on Linux and some of those tools that seem

28:12.420 --> 28:14.420
so tempting by the other platforms?

28:14.420 --> 28:17.700
How are we doing on the Linux side?

28:17.700 --> 28:21.960
And there of course have been some big boosts recently that have landed for Linux content

28:21.960 --> 28:26.340
creators that we haven't really talked about much on air in one cohesive piece.

28:26.340 --> 28:30.700
So we thought, you know, our buddy Drew, perfect guy to tackle this, right?

28:30.700 --> 28:33.860
I mean this is his sweet spot right here.

28:33.860 --> 28:37.980
He's gone above and beyond in the past to stick with Linux.

28:37.980 --> 28:41.740
He's documented that before on Joe's Late Night Linux Extra.

28:41.740 --> 28:44.940
And he's also mastered audio editing and mixing on Linux.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.480
So he's really kind of in this area.

28:46.480 --> 28:49.700
So we called him up last night to chat about this.

28:49.700 --> 28:53.820
And Virtual Lug, I want you to listen along and then flag me in the chat with your thoughts

28:53.820 --> 28:59.420
and then we're going to follow up after this chat with Drew and expand on it a little bit.

28:59.420 --> 29:03.180
So we'll go back in time to last night when we called up Drew.

29:03.180 --> 29:07.080
Hey guys, how you doing?

29:07.080 --> 29:09.980
It's been a minute and this really felt like it was in your wheelhouse.

29:09.980 --> 29:13.620
Are you ready to help us solve a couple of particular problems?

29:13.620 --> 29:15.340
I will certainly try.

29:15.340 --> 29:17.040
I'll do my best here.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.040
No promises, of course.

29:18.040 --> 29:21.780
No, it's just all resting on your shoulders and it goes like this.

29:21.780 --> 29:25.860
John writes into the show, greeting lepers, do you sometimes wonder if it's time to give

29:25.860 --> 29:28.980
up on Linux as your daily driver?

29:28.980 --> 29:34.260
I'm no stranger to Linux, having built a PC with bespoke components in 1995 so that I

29:34.260 --> 29:39.560
could run Slackware 1.0 on a 15 inch CRT monitor.

29:39.560 --> 29:45.060
But I've used the Mac exclusively since 2000 after starting a new job in a window shop

29:45.060 --> 29:46.060
in 2008.

29:46.060 --> 29:50.680
I just didn't feel like spending the money to go upgrade to a new MacBook Pro.

29:50.680 --> 29:54.420
So I found myself exploring desktop environments.

29:54.420 --> 30:00.420
But about a year ago, I bought a System76 Lemur Pro running Pop OS.

30:00.420 --> 30:01.420
And here's my dilemma.

30:01.420 --> 30:02.980
I love my Lemur Pro.

30:02.980 --> 30:04.020
I love it.

30:04.020 --> 30:09.100
But since getting it, I've decided maybe I'd return to podcasting.

30:09.100 --> 30:12.340
And that's where things have become a problem.

30:12.340 --> 30:16.660
I find that I need to run a VM for certain audio applications frequently.

30:16.660 --> 30:22.420
It started with DScript, then the Rodecaster Pro utilities, the Hindenburg Journalist Pro,

30:22.420 --> 30:27.220
and I just find myself in Windows more often than I would like.

30:27.220 --> 30:29.900
And I hate Windows.

30:29.900 --> 30:34.420
Sure there are plenty of digital audio workstations out there available for Linux.

30:34.420 --> 30:35.420
But DScript?

30:35.420 --> 30:38.080
DScript will probably never be available.

30:38.080 --> 30:43.260
And it's just amazing how much faster DScript is than a traditional editor.

30:43.260 --> 30:45.120
And at what point do I just give up?

30:45.120 --> 30:48.140
What point do I just give up and return to a mainstream desktop?

30:48.140 --> 30:49.660
Is it when I have two apps in a VM?

30:49.660 --> 30:51.340
Is it three apps in a VM?

30:51.340 --> 30:52.340
Where's the line?

30:52.340 --> 30:53.460
And what do you guys think?

30:53.460 --> 30:54.460
Thanks in advance.

30:54.460 --> 30:56.460
And I'm interested to hear your thoughts.

30:56.460 --> 30:59.680
Now I thought, Drew, this is really two questions.

30:59.680 --> 31:04.400
This is, how do you stick with Linux when things get a little tough?

31:04.400 --> 31:06.860
And how do you produce content on Linux?

31:06.860 --> 31:10.620
And I was curious to get your take on both of these, because obviously they're right

31:10.620 --> 31:11.620
in your wheelhouse.

31:11.620 --> 31:12.620
Okay.

31:12.620 --> 31:19.260
So first things first, honestly, use the tool that is the most comfortable and the best

31:19.260 --> 31:20.780
for you.

31:20.780 --> 31:23.980
Yes, you can do all of this on Linux.

31:23.980 --> 31:30.260
But if you absolutely have to have DScript or whatever other tool that only runs on Windows,

31:30.260 --> 31:34.940
and that's the only way you want to do it, just do it on Windows.

31:34.940 --> 31:35.940
Nothing's stopping you.

31:35.940 --> 31:39.460
I mean, yeah, if you hate Windows and you don't want to be going back and forth into

31:39.460 --> 31:45.820
a VM or dual booting or whatever, you can certainly do it on Linux.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.060
The way I do it is with Reaper.

31:48.060 --> 31:55.880
I also use Yawbridge for some Windows VSTs that I quite like, and they run great on Linux.

31:55.880 --> 32:01.460
And I have set up my Reaper with so many keyboard shortcuts and macros, I don't even remember

32:01.460 --> 32:04.100
what the defaults are anymore.

32:04.100 --> 32:09.900
And those make me considerably faster than I would be in something like Ardor or what

32:09.900 --> 32:10.900
have you.

32:10.900 --> 32:16.060
So, I don't know, I mean, I want to say, yeah, do it all on Linux.

32:16.060 --> 32:21.900
But at the same time, it's like, well, if DScript is really that important to your workflow,

32:21.900 --> 32:27.540
if this other tool is that important to your workflow, use the best tool that you have

32:27.540 --> 32:28.940
available to you.

32:28.940 --> 32:33.500
It also seems like there's maybe a trade-off of how invested do you want to be in playing

32:33.500 --> 32:34.500
with that tooling?

32:34.500 --> 32:38.140
Like, I know, Joe, as you said, you've spent a lot of time customizing Reaper to work well

32:38.140 --> 32:39.140
for you.

32:39.140 --> 32:42.000
And you've also definitely learned the ins and outs of working with wine, making things

32:42.000 --> 32:44.100
like Yawbridge work nicely.

32:44.100 --> 32:49.340
But that might not be interesting enough or worthwhile enough if folks just want to concentrate

32:49.340 --> 32:50.780
on whatever that application is.

32:50.780 --> 32:51.780
Oh, for sure.

32:51.780 --> 32:56.380
I mean, I had the privilege of working in a job where I could work on this stuff all

32:56.380 --> 33:00.500
day and get paid to figure out how to do this stuff on Linux.

33:00.500 --> 33:03.700
So that certainly helped.

33:03.700 --> 33:08.700
But if that's not your jam, and it's not your jam, there's no shame in that.

33:08.700 --> 33:11.460
Here's where I think the struggle comes in.

33:11.460 --> 33:14.500
Because if you and I were having this conversation, you'd tell me just suck it up and use Reaper

33:14.500 --> 33:18.560
on Linux is what you'd actually, that's what you'd really say to me.

33:18.560 --> 33:19.840
But here's where the problem is.

33:19.840 --> 33:23.780
So let's focus in on DScript because it's a really good example.

33:23.780 --> 33:32.660
DScript is a new kind of audio editor that uses a cloud component to analyze audio and

33:32.660 --> 33:35.300
create and generate a transcript.

33:35.300 --> 33:39.140
And then it allows you to edit the audio like you would edit a text document.

33:39.140 --> 33:44.060
So you edit the transcript and on the back end, the application does audio editing.

33:44.060 --> 33:49.020
But what's even more incredible is, of course, this is going to have just full disclaimer,

33:49.020 --> 33:54.660
probably very, very poor results compared to someone who knows how to edit.

33:54.660 --> 33:58.860
But something else it offers is you can actually copy and paste text.

33:58.860 --> 34:04.660
And it will generate the audio of you saying those things based on what its machine learning

34:04.660 --> 34:07.620
has figured out from how you spoke the other words.

34:07.620 --> 34:13.100
And it can actually generate you saying the or adding a word into an audio track.

34:13.100 --> 34:14.100
Wow.

34:14.100 --> 34:15.900
Yeah, it's pretty remarkable.

34:15.900 --> 34:20.980
So you can have like for me, the compelling thing would be the use case that even for

34:20.980 --> 34:28.100
this podcast right here would be you download a two hour talk from, say, Foss Talk or from

34:28.100 --> 34:31.380
Linux Fest or from whatever, you know, event that might be.

34:31.380 --> 34:34.500
Maybe somebody you love is up there doing something or has some topic that you want

34:34.500 --> 34:36.020
to know more about.

34:36.020 --> 34:39.300
You could download it into this DScript editor.

34:39.300 --> 34:43.340
It would generate a transcript of the entire thing for you, which is fairly accurate and

34:43.340 --> 34:44.340
getting better all the time.

34:44.340 --> 34:48.000
And this is a this is a tool that is being used at some scale right now.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.220
So it's not like it's vaporware.

34:50.220 --> 34:54.660
And you could just search the document for the section of the talk that we wanted, like

34:54.660 --> 34:58.180
somebody maybe talking specifically about a component for three minutes in a two hour

34:58.180 --> 34:59.180
talk.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.980
And I could grab that audio for the show that way.

35:00.980 --> 35:03.300
I mean, it's a very compelling tool.

35:03.300 --> 35:09.260
The problem is it only works on the Mac and I don't want to run on the Mac.

35:09.260 --> 35:11.660
And the Mac is a pain in the ass to virtualize.

35:11.660 --> 35:13.940
The Macs are extremely expensive.

35:13.940 --> 35:15.940
Mac OS really locks you in.

35:15.940 --> 35:18.900
I want to use Linux for everything else.

35:18.900 --> 35:22.420
But from time to time, there's tools like this that have come along and you've got to

35:22.420 --> 35:26.060
acknowledge this must have hit you at some point, too, Drew, where at some point in the

35:26.060 --> 35:31.460
last decade, tools come along that's only available on another platform and it's tugged

35:31.460 --> 35:36.220
at your, oh, maybe I should consider getting a Mac or maybe I should consider installing

35:36.220 --> 35:37.220
Windows.

35:37.220 --> 35:42.420
Or it's tugged on that that that thing that tempts you to leave the Linux platform.

35:42.420 --> 35:45.700
And I'm curious what you've done in those situations.

35:45.700 --> 35:48.340
Like did you explore it and then come back?

35:48.340 --> 35:50.620
Or did you find a way to stick with Linux?

35:50.620 --> 35:55.640
That's a tricky question for me, because remember, I'm coming from doing rock and roll and live

35:55.640 --> 35:58.660
shows for years and years and years, right?

35:58.660 --> 36:07.700
So I was used to real hardware mixers and outboard compression gear and stuff like that.

36:07.700 --> 36:15.020
So for me, it's less about, oh, this tool is really cool and more I need it to sound

36:15.020 --> 36:16.020
this way.

36:16.020 --> 36:17.220
How do I get there?

36:17.220 --> 36:24.040
So I'm a little less of like, oh, it's got to be this one specific tool and more I just

36:24.040 --> 36:26.500
need it to do what I need it to do.

36:26.500 --> 36:31.500
And it turns out there's a wide variety of plugins that work really well on Linux.

36:31.500 --> 36:37.020
And sure, I use some Windows stuff because it works really well and I like the way it's

36:37.020 --> 36:40.340
designed and it sounds great and all of that.

36:40.340 --> 36:44.140
But I can still do it on Linux through Winebridge.

36:44.140 --> 36:48.780
So no, I haven't really gone out and said, oh, well, you know, I need to be using this

36:48.780 --> 36:55.560
tool that's only on Mac or that's only on Windows because it's just not that interesting

36:55.560 --> 36:56.660
to me.

36:56.660 --> 37:02.220
I'd rather use what I'm more comfortable with and find a tool that will do what I want it

37:02.220 --> 37:04.860
to do in the platform I'm on.

37:04.860 --> 37:07.140
But I'm also, you know, weird that way.

37:07.140 --> 37:08.140
What about you, S?

37:08.140 --> 37:11.260
Have you ever wandered away from Linux for a bit and then found your way back?

37:11.260 --> 37:15.820
I mean, I definitely have had more VMs in the past.

37:15.820 --> 37:20.660
I think partly, and this is definitely a position of privilege, but I tend to try to avoid things

37:20.660 --> 37:22.620
like that if I can.

37:22.620 --> 37:26.180
And I'll be the first to admit, sometimes that means I'm using a worse solution.

37:26.180 --> 37:29.740
This is in a different space entirely, but Plex is kind of one of those things.

37:29.740 --> 37:31.220
I mean, I have a Plex account.

37:31.220 --> 37:35.900
I watch stuff on Plex from people's shares, but I've kind of purposefully avoided really

37:35.900 --> 37:40.940
investing all in because I knew that there were open source solutions and I was willing

37:40.940 --> 37:41.940
to make that work.

37:41.940 --> 37:45.160
It doesn't mean I don't appreciate some of the nicer aspects that some of these more

37:45.160 --> 37:50.960
proprietary products might have, but maybe to Drew's point, if I can focus on the goal

37:50.960 --> 37:56.080
that I have and then evaluate the tools and if it meets that goal enough and it makes

37:56.080 --> 38:00.240
me comfortable and it's on the system that it already works, I kind of just try to focus

38:00.240 --> 38:01.240
on that.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.240
Yeah.

38:02.240 --> 38:07.900
I feel like what John is hitting up against when he writes in is he switched back to Linux,

38:07.900 --> 38:10.460
he got the Lemur, and then he's like, man, this thing is powerful.

38:10.460 --> 38:13.740
I could produce an entire podcast on this thing.

38:13.740 --> 38:18.580
And when you haven't been on Linux for a while or you're new to it, you don't really have

38:18.580 --> 38:20.740
a lot of knowledge to pull from.

38:20.740 --> 38:24.500
And so the first solutions that start coming to you are going to be from the platforms

38:24.500 --> 38:25.500
you're most familiar with.

38:25.500 --> 38:30.500
So if you spent the most time on Mac and Windows, you're going to kind of almost already know

38:30.500 --> 38:33.780
what direction to go in for those platforms and not really know where to even start with

38:33.780 --> 38:34.780
Linux.

38:34.780 --> 38:35.780
Right.

38:35.780 --> 38:39.340
You framed it in the terms of how the problem would be on Mac and Windows even.

38:39.340 --> 38:40.340
Yeah.

38:40.340 --> 38:41.340
Yeah.

38:41.340 --> 38:44.060
And I totally get that too when you're just trying to get something done.

38:44.060 --> 38:48.860
And I think that's where Drew's overall point is really a sound one, is don't feel guilty

38:48.860 --> 38:49.860
about it.

38:49.860 --> 38:51.900
Use the right tool for the job.

38:51.900 --> 38:55.860
Maybe it means you end up using Linux for 80% of your desktop use, but you have a laptop

38:55.860 --> 38:59.220
that runs another operating system that you use for another tool.

38:59.220 --> 39:00.220
Yes.

39:00.220 --> 39:03.480
That's definitely something we've both explored too, I think, is, you know, you don't look

39:03.480 --> 39:06.940
down on someone who has a piece of hardware or audio gear.

39:06.940 --> 39:10.020
And yes, a Mac is more of a general purpose computer.

39:10.020 --> 39:12.820
And of course, in the Linux and open source world, we have issues with those being locked

39:12.820 --> 39:13.820
down.

39:13.820 --> 39:18.540
But if you just set it aside as a purpose built, this is how I edit my podcasts or maybe

39:18.540 --> 39:22.580
this is how I do my like outlook for work and I keep my communications on this and then

39:22.580 --> 39:26.920
I have desktop Linux and all the joys on everything else.

39:26.920 --> 39:30.880
Sometimes the compartmentalization can be nice, especially, I would say, invest in making

39:30.880 --> 39:34.740
sure that you're not paying a really large tax in switching systems because the second

39:34.740 --> 39:37.880
you're like, oh, I've got to unplug cables just to get my Linux desktop back set up to

39:37.880 --> 39:39.340
my monitors.

39:39.340 --> 39:41.460
That's where it's tempting to stop doing that.

39:41.460 --> 39:45.140
But if you've got it all set up nicely, you've got a KVM switch or whatever makes it simple

39:45.140 --> 39:49.860
to switch to the system you need for the task you want, and then get back to desktop Linux.

39:49.860 --> 39:52.420
I find that much easier, totally well put.

39:52.420 --> 39:55.940
And I'm going to I'll add this before we get into some tools here, because that's the second

39:55.940 --> 39:57.380
part of this question.

39:57.380 --> 39:58.980
But I think this is a good spot to transition.

39:58.980 --> 40:03.940
But I will just add this that long term, if you invest the time to do the production under

40:03.940 --> 40:11.140
Linux, that is where the puck is skating to what we can do now in Linux with PipeWire

40:11.140 --> 40:19.180
and Jack and Reaper and applications like Sonobus are so far beyond what was capable

40:19.180 --> 40:24.560
when I started about 15 years ago, that just yesterday, Wes and I were working on something

40:24.560 --> 40:30.300
that I was thinking to myself, if I could have told 15 year version of me that there

40:30.300 --> 40:34.020
would have been a go that there would have been something like this, I wouldn't have

40:34.020 --> 40:37.060
even understood how it could have been possible, what Linux can do today.

40:37.060 --> 40:41.540
It's so it is advanced so far in media production.

40:41.540 --> 40:45.860
And if so, if you take the time to learn it, and you're willing to invest it, and you have

40:45.860 --> 40:50.500
that time to invest, eventually, it pays off this entire conversation that we're having

40:50.500 --> 40:51.500
right now.

40:51.500 --> 40:52.780
We're all on Linux.

40:52.780 --> 40:57.820
We're all doing it with tools that are integrated into our audio subsystem at a very awesome

40:57.820 --> 41:00.860
level that I didn't think would even be possible.

41:00.860 --> 41:03.100
And we're just using it to have this chat right now.

41:03.100 --> 41:04.920
It's so cool.

41:04.920 --> 41:07.420
So let's talk a little bit about the tools.

41:07.420 --> 41:14.140
Because Drew in there, you mentioned Reaper, he's really liking this Hindenburg journalist

41:14.140 --> 41:18.660
audio editor, which kind of is like GarageBand, but for podcasts, and it really blocks things

41:18.660 --> 41:20.220
up really nicely.

41:20.220 --> 41:24.220
It's a really easy to lay it out kind of podcast, I don't know how it would work if you have

41:24.220 --> 41:28.800
like eight tracks, and it was two hours long, but it seems like it's very approachable.

41:28.800 --> 41:32.900
But there are a lot of tools available for Linux today that were only available, that

41:32.900 --> 41:35.580
have only been around for a couple of years, so I thought maybe we could hit on a couple

41:35.580 --> 41:36.580
of the highlights.

41:36.580 --> 41:37.580
Reaper is obviously one of them.

41:37.580 --> 41:41.920
But I think beyond that, it's kind of how you have learned to use the tool.

41:41.920 --> 41:46.540
And we should disclaim that Reaper is a digital audio workstation style editor.

41:46.540 --> 41:48.980
It's what we use to record the shows.

41:48.980 --> 41:51.880
And it's one of Drew's go to tools.

41:51.880 --> 41:56.460
And we should probably also note that it is proprietary, although very reasonably priced.

41:56.460 --> 41:57.460
Yep.

41:57.460 --> 42:00.540
So what do you think, Drew, besides just Reaper itself, it's how you use it.

42:00.540 --> 42:01.980
There's other tools as well.

42:01.980 --> 42:05.960
Give us a snapshot of what you consider to be the state of Linux podcasting tools right

42:05.960 --> 42:06.960
now.

42:06.960 --> 42:11.980
There are a lot of plugins that are available for Linux, like directly, natively for Linux

42:11.980 --> 42:15.380
that you don't even have to put through a bridge.

42:15.380 --> 42:20.020
And I know we're going to harp on Reaper a lot, but because it's amazing, they have a

42:20.020 --> 42:27.380
bunch of tools in the box that are available for free for Linux, like studio quality compressors,

42:27.380 --> 42:35.180
studio quality reverb units, really, really cool stuff that you can use for free.

42:35.180 --> 42:40.020
Not even just in Reaper, they release them as VSTs that you can load on your system.

42:40.020 --> 42:44.820
They're not the prettiest, but they definitely get the job done.

42:44.820 --> 42:46.940
So definitely check out the Reaper plugins.

42:46.940 --> 42:53.300
Even if you're not using Reaper itself, but you have something that is VST capable.

42:53.300 --> 42:54.500
They're great.

42:54.500 --> 42:58.140
Ardor also has a lot of great built-in plugins.

42:58.140 --> 43:02.620
There's the CAF plugins, which I don't really like that much, but they've been around forever.

43:02.620 --> 43:04.460
They're kind of a staple.

43:04.460 --> 43:11.960
There's the LSP plugins collection, which is fantastic and really good to use, although

43:11.960 --> 43:15.500
I do find they're a little heavy on the CPU.

43:15.500 --> 43:18.360
Air windows is available for Linux.

43:18.360 --> 43:22.680
There's all kinds of stuff out there that can help you with your mixes.

43:22.680 --> 43:30.580
As far as editing, for podcast production, I don't find Ardor to be very good, personally.

43:30.580 --> 43:36.980
The editor is not geared towards this kind of production and it's a lot harder to make

43:36.980 --> 43:38.180
it be that way.

43:38.180 --> 43:43.620
I edited on that for a long time before Reaper came to Linux and it's a great editor.

43:43.620 --> 43:49.340
In my opinion, it's probably the best multi-track recorder out there.

43:49.340 --> 43:53.140
But for editing podcast, it's really hard, it's really slow.

43:53.140 --> 43:54.140
It's fair.

43:54.140 --> 43:55.980
I completely agree with your take.

43:55.980 --> 43:57.620
It's probably better for music production.

43:57.620 --> 43:59.780
Yeah, it's great for music production.

43:59.780 --> 44:03.540
Seems like it works nice too sometimes, maybe just setting up for mixing or routing or applying

44:03.540 --> 44:04.540
effects live.

44:04.540 --> 44:05.540
Yep.

44:05.540 --> 44:06.540
Mm-hmm.

44:06.540 --> 44:11.120
I think we have to also mention what Wes and I are extremely, and Drew too, very excited

44:11.120 --> 44:15.940
about is Sonobus, which we mentioned last week on the show as an app pick, but we've

44:15.940 --> 44:19.620
been using it this week as the method that we communicate.

44:19.620 --> 44:25.340
And it is a Linux desktop app also available for the other desktops and mobile devices

44:25.340 --> 44:26.340
that use...

44:26.340 --> 44:32.460
And it's open source and it uses Opus to create a peer-to-peer audio session that is incredible

44:32.460 --> 44:37.100
audio quality that integrates in with jack audio so we can route it around with everything

44:37.100 --> 44:41.820
else that we route with jack audio in our system and bring it directly into our audio

44:41.820 --> 44:42.820
editor.

44:42.820 --> 44:44.860
This is radio quality grade software.

44:44.860 --> 44:48.660
I mean, it sounds incredible and the latency is the best you're going to get.

44:48.660 --> 44:51.460
It gives you data that the other tools don't give you.

44:51.460 --> 44:55.980
You combine that with PipeWire, which Wes and I have just begun messing with for remote

44:55.980 --> 45:01.300
production setups and PipeWire brings some functionality.

45:01.300 --> 45:06.140
It's like not all of it, but some core functionality that you get from a software on the Mac called

45:06.140 --> 45:11.500
Audio Hijack Pro, which is one of those third-party Mac software tools that in the past I've

45:11.500 --> 45:14.900
looked at and gone, Oh God, I'd love to have that on Linux.

45:14.900 --> 45:16.900
I would love to have that.

45:16.900 --> 45:20.060
But PipeWire gets a lot of it of what I would need.

45:20.060 --> 45:23.740
There's a lot more Audio Hijack can do, but PipeWire is also new, but we were just playing

45:23.740 --> 45:28.860
around with that last night where I was able to take the audio output of applications like

45:28.860 --> 45:38.020
Firefox and VLC and then route them all into Sonobus using PipeWire and the jack tools

45:38.020 --> 45:40.460
that you can use to manipulate some of those settings.

45:40.460 --> 45:46.460
And it means that I could host a remote streaming session all on one laptop recording with separate

45:46.460 --> 45:51.600
audio tracks all routed through PipeWire going through Sonobus back to the studio.

45:51.600 --> 45:54.280
And it just is seamless.

45:54.280 --> 45:55.620
It's really awesome stuff.

45:55.620 --> 45:59.540
The other part too is some of this stuff was definitely already possible, especially with

45:59.540 --> 46:03.960
Jack, but it was a little more complicated than I think you especially were really interested

46:03.960 --> 46:04.960
in investing in.

46:04.960 --> 46:09.500
You had to manipulate a whole bunch of pulse audio bridges and run some command line stuff,

46:09.500 --> 46:14.100
but this was just you pulled up one tool and you could move audio wherever you want it.

46:14.100 --> 46:18.480
I think I've heard just about every Linux podcaster make a joke about Jack audio being

46:18.480 --> 46:23.740
too complicated at some point, you know, it's like it's it's a cliche about how complicated

46:23.740 --> 46:24.740
Jack is.

46:24.740 --> 46:25.940
Well, and they're not wrong.

46:25.940 --> 46:33.540
I mean, Jack is really designed to function like you would route cables in a studio to

46:33.540 --> 46:35.260
real hardware.

46:35.260 --> 46:37.200
That's the way it's set up.

46:37.200 --> 46:40.960
And if you don't have that background and don't want to learn that stuff, you just want

46:40.960 --> 46:42.020
it to work.

46:42.020 --> 46:43.420
It's not the tool for you.

46:43.420 --> 46:44.420
Right.

46:44.420 --> 46:45.540
But yeah, PipeWire is amazing.

46:45.540 --> 46:49.800
I've been using it for a few months now and it's only gotten better.

46:49.800 --> 46:53.020
You bring things like PipeWire landing in Fedora 34.

46:53.020 --> 46:55.100
It's available in just about every distro right now.

46:55.100 --> 46:59.200
It's super simple to get up and running in just about any modern distro.

46:59.200 --> 47:04.720
You bring PipeWire together, something like Sonobus and a tool like Reaper and you have

47:04.720 --> 47:10.060
everything I needed to build a studio four years ago in a laptop or a desktop all on

47:10.060 --> 47:11.940
Linux.

47:11.940 --> 47:14.420
Most of it free software with the exception of Reaper.

47:14.420 --> 47:16.260
It's just it's really awesome.

47:16.260 --> 47:21.340
So John, it is worth learning because when you do get all the pieces together, what you

47:21.340 --> 47:23.600
get is vendor independence.

47:23.600 --> 47:28.840
So now your content production is is independent of what Apple does with their processors or

47:28.840 --> 47:30.480
their operating system.

47:30.480 --> 47:35.100
It's totally separated from Microsoft and the hell of Windows and it's your desktop

47:35.100 --> 47:37.600
environment, your operating system of choice.

47:37.600 --> 47:41.500
And then you get all the other great features like so we'll stack WireGuard in on this.

47:41.500 --> 47:45.800
So now we're connecting our studio systems via a WireGuard network.

47:45.800 --> 47:50.120
And maybe while we're at it, we'll go to a low latency kernel and we'll use a specially

47:50.120 --> 47:52.960
tuned ButterFS partition for our recordings.

47:52.960 --> 47:57.020
You can start leveraging all of the other technologies in Linux that make Linux great

47:57.020 --> 48:02.660
for servers and other desktop workstation use cases that make it also great for audio

48:02.660 --> 48:04.080
and video production.

48:04.080 --> 48:07.360
And you only get to take advantage of that stuff when you've learned the tools and you

48:07.360 --> 48:09.560
just you have to start the journey one step at a time.

48:09.560 --> 48:12.280
So hopefully some of this stuff will be useful to you.

48:12.280 --> 48:16.720
We will pick Drew's brain and Wes and I will get a collection of our links together for

48:16.720 --> 48:19.960
some of these for some of these different tools and applications we've talked about.

48:19.960 --> 48:21.280
And you can take a look at those.

48:21.280 --> 48:27.400
We'll have them all linked up at linuxunplug.com slash 394.

48:27.400 --> 48:30.240
Thank you to Drew for coming on and helping us sort through that.

48:30.240 --> 48:34.480
So I thought we'd we'd have a little confession time with our virtual lug.

48:34.480 --> 48:40.520
I know ByteBitton, you said that you've had some steps along the path to sticking with

48:40.520 --> 48:42.280
Linux that you wanted to share with the class.

48:42.280 --> 48:43.280
Yeah.

48:43.280 --> 48:50.640
So what I usually do is check can I show the most obvious step is, is there a tool in Linux

48:50.640 --> 48:54.560
that can handle the tasks that I want to do?

48:54.560 --> 48:57.840
But sadly, that is not always the thing.

48:57.840 --> 49:02.080
And usually some specific software is known for that specific function.

49:02.080 --> 49:05.640
So you usually need that piece of software.

49:05.640 --> 49:09.160
And then I start to look in, can I run it in wine?

49:09.160 --> 49:18.200
Can I go a step just a step a step higher with the crossover from code weavers or stuff

49:18.200 --> 49:24.280
like that, because the issue with going into a virtual machine is, yes, you can do a virtual

49:24.280 --> 49:27.840
machine, but windows does updates.

49:27.840 --> 49:28.840
Windows does drivers.

49:28.840 --> 49:29.840
Yeah.

49:29.840 --> 49:30.840
And it's slower.

49:30.840 --> 49:31.840
It is slower.

49:31.840 --> 49:32.840
Yep.

49:32.840 --> 49:39.120
But the thing is that once you do need that tool to run on windows and yeah, you can do

49:39.120 --> 49:44.080
something within the virtual machine, but there are also some modes like seamless mode.

49:44.080 --> 49:50.680
So where you start the application within the windows system, but it has its application

49:50.680 --> 49:52.480
window in your Linux box.

49:52.480 --> 49:57.040
So that makes the transition a bit easier to work with.

49:57.040 --> 50:03.760
And there are also some windows versions that are more dressed down from functions and other

50:03.760 --> 50:05.040
things to run lighter.

50:05.040 --> 50:09.800
Well, I know we have more to get to in the post show, so we will cover some more of those.

50:09.800 --> 50:12.480
And of course, a big thank you to Drew for coming on.

50:12.480 --> 50:18.000
He came on late after working, and that was after he spent the weekend patching servers.

50:18.000 --> 50:22.240
And we told him to use a brand new audio tool to join us, which he'd never tried before.

50:22.240 --> 50:25.180
But of course, he's always down to cloud because it is pretty fun to play with that stuff.

50:25.180 --> 50:29.280
So thanks to Drew as well.

50:29.280 --> 50:31.320
Datadog.com slash unplugged.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.580
So Datadog is how you see it all.

50:33.580 --> 50:37.860
If you have an on premises set up, if you use cloud infrastructure or you use everything

50:37.860 --> 50:41.560
in between, you want to visualize it all in one place.

50:41.560 --> 50:45.960
So why not something that gives you drag and drop dashboards to visualize all of the metrics

50:45.960 --> 50:50.920
from the bare Linux stuff up all the way to the application stack in your website.

50:50.920 --> 50:55.360
Datadog is about visualizing the entire stack, quickly analyze the performance of your Linux

50:55.360 --> 50:57.000
servers in real time.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.600
These customizable dashboards are beautiful.

50:59.600 --> 51:03.840
You got to go to datadog.com slash unplugged just to check those out.

51:03.840 --> 51:09.080
But if you're there, you sign up and you create one dashboard, you can get a free t-shirt

51:09.080 --> 51:11.600
as well by going to datadog.com slash unplugged.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.960
And of course, you support this show.

51:13.960 --> 51:18.840
So when you're there, take a look around and see how Datadog can be used as a tool for

51:18.840 --> 51:20.880
you to communicate with your team.

51:20.880 --> 51:24.560
And you can set up, of course, alerts and different events that can be pushed into your

51:24.560 --> 51:28.520
Slack communications or be sent to different messaging systems that you use.

51:28.520 --> 51:31.840
You can integrate it with whatever tool your team uses.

51:31.840 --> 51:36.000
Additionally, Datadog itself has integrations for over 400 technologies.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.760
Like just turnkey, now you're getting metrics into Datadog and you're visualizing the entire

51:40.760 --> 51:41.760
thing.

51:41.760 --> 51:43.440
This is data to make decisions with.

51:43.440 --> 51:47.880
This is data to communicate with your team, datadog.com slash unplugged.

51:47.880 --> 51:55.520
Go there, start a free trial, create one dashboard and get a free Datadog t-shirt, datadog.com

51:55.520 --> 51:56.520
slash unplugged.

51:56.520 --> 52:00.080
And a big thank you to Datadog for building tools to help teams communicate.

52:00.080 --> 52:05.440
And of course, for sponsoring this here podcast.

52:05.440 --> 52:07.960
We have a really cool pick this week.

52:07.960 --> 52:10.920
There's been several ways to go about this problem.

52:10.920 --> 52:15.280
And that is, wouldn't it be great if you could take all of the coolness of Proton, which

52:15.280 --> 52:19.960
has seen a lot of advancements in running Windows applications, and just use Proton

52:19.960 --> 52:23.320
to run everyday Windows apps?

52:23.320 --> 52:25.840
And it turns out you can.

52:25.840 --> 52:30.080
Proton Collar, run any Windows program through Valve's Proton.

52:30.080 --> 52:31.260
And Chris, you'll love this.

52:31.260 --> 52:35.240
Not only is it already in the AUR, it's powered by Rust.

52:35.240 --> 52:36.240
What was that?

52:36.240 --> 52:37.240
Hold on, I'm sorry.

52:37.240 --> 52:41.240
Did you say it was powered by Rust?

52:41.240 --> 52:46.120
I sure did.

52:46.120 --> 52:48.880
I don't know why, but I misunderstood our conversation earlier.

52:48.880 --> 52:52.960
And I actually thought you told me, it's too bad it's not using Rust.

52:52.960 --> 52:54.560
I just totally misunderstood you.

52:54.560 --> 52:59.120
And so I'm actually legitimately surprised this is a Rust app.

52:59.120 --> 53:01.980
Yeah, and there have been a couple of weird ways to do this.

53:01.980 --> 53:05.520
But Proton is so neat, and it's seen so much development.

53:05.520 --> 53:09.400
So wouldn't it be great if you could use it to run an application, perhaps a Windows application

53:09.400 --> 53:11.160
that needs some 3D support?

53:11.160 --> 53:14.240
Yeah, and I'll admit, Proton's a little bit of a black box.

53:14.240 --> 53:17.800
I click the button, maybe I have to change the version sometimes, and then I just cross

53:17.800 --> 53:19.640
my fingers and hope the game runs.

53:19.640 --> 53:21.520
It's cool that this sort of exposes things for you.

53:21.520 --> 53:25.920
You can specify what Proton version to use on the command line, or even point it to your

53:25.920 --> 53:29.280
Steam apps folder where there's all the juicy details.

53:29.280 --> 53:31.120
And it's all open source online.

53:31.120 --> 53:35.840
Of course, right now, there are no releases, binary releases available.

53:35.840 --> 53:38.920
Easiest way to get it is the AUR, but they've got build instructions.

53:38.920 --> 53:39.920
You just need cargo.

53:39.920 --> 53:40.920
Yeah.

53:40.920 --> 53:43.080
I mean, that way you get to feel accomplished for the day.

53:43.080 --> 53:45.040
What did you say that name was again, Wes?

53:45.040 --> 53:46.040
Proton Collar.

53:46.040 --> 53:47.040
Proton Collar.

53:47.040 --> 53:48.040
There you go.

53:48.040 --> 53:53.040
It needs an echo effect as well.

53:53.040 --> 53:59.240
That's pretty neat, we'll have a link to that.

53:59.240 --> 54:03.560
Everything is linked at linuxunplugged.com slash 394.

54:03.560 --> 54:05.880
Thank you to our Unplugged Core contributors.

54:05.880 --> 54:08.640
You are our core.

54:08.640 --> 54:09.640
That's why we call you that.

54:09.640 --> 54:13.040
You are the core of this show, and you keep us going, unpluggedcore.com.

54:13.040 --> 54:16.800
Help us stay independent, reduce the ad load needed for this here show, and of course,

54:16.800 --> 54:21.800
you get two feeds, limited ad version of the show, same full production, just limited ads,

54:21.800 --> 54:23.880
or get the full thing, the live stream.

54:23.880 --> 54:27.280
That one's fun because you hear all of our friends show up.

54:27.280 --> 54:30.880
They show up and we say, oh, hi, hey, Bray, good to see you, and you hear everybody kind

54:30.880 --> 54:34.580
of shuffling in for the day and us grousing about stuff.

54:34.580 --> 54:36.200
It's a whole additional show.

54:36.200 --> 54:40.280
It's just really relaxed and chill, plus a bunch of the post-show stuff, so you get access

54:40.280 --> 54:42.280
to either one of those.

54:42.280 --> 54:46.080
Also that second feed, we try to get that out pronto after the show, so it's another

54:46.080 --> 54:50.760
way to get it right away if that works better for your afternoon commute.

54:50.760 --> 54:54.280
Also we'd love to hear from you, so head over to our website, linuxunplugged.com.

54:54.280 --> 54:58.600
There you'll find links to Matrix, you'll find links to, I don't know, the contact form,

54:58.600 --> 55:00.280
you know, good old traditional email.

55:00.280 --> 55:01.280
It's like new again.

55:01.280 --> 55:02.280
You should try it.

55:02.280 --> 55:04.880
And also, of course, our mumble is over there as well.

55:04.880 --> 55:11.320
And our live time, well, that's actually a different website now that I think about it,

55:11.320 --> 55:15.400
but it always stays the same unless it doesn't because something...

55:15.400 --> 55:16.400
You better check.

55:16.400 --> 55:17.400
Yeah, you better check.

55:17.400 --> 55:20.920
Jupiterbroadcasting.com's last calendar, but we try to do it on a Tuesday.

55:20.920 --> 55:22.320
See you next week.

55:22.320 --> 55:24.800
Same bad time, same bad station.

55:24.800 --> 55:27.800
And of course you can find the show on Twitter, at Linux Unplugged.

55:27.800 --> 55:30.120
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

55:30.120 --> 55:38.300
And all of our fantastic shows, whole family of shows, all having a big hug over at Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

55:38.300 --> 55:43.320
Do make it live if you can because then you can participate and you can get your word

55:43.320 --> 55:44.320
into the show.

55:44.320 --> 55:45.940
We'd love to have you do that.

55:45.940 --> 55:46.940
Find information at our website.

55:46.940 --> 55:50.920
Thanks so much for joining us in this week's episode of this here Unplugged program.

55:50.920 --> 55:53.200
I'm going to get out of here and go play with Sonobos and Pipewire.

55:53.200 --> 55:55.400
I am like totally jazz.

55:55.400 --> 55:58.680
You guys got to, you guys got to watch out because I'm not going to stop talking about

55:58.680 --> 55:59.680
it.

55:59.680 --> 56:00.680
It's that exciting.

56:00.680 --> 56:01.680
I think you might mean you're totally jacked.

56:01.680 --> 56:03.520
I see what you did there.

56:03.520 --> 56:27.920
See you next Tuesday.

56:33.520 --> 56:44.080
All right, let's go boat.

56:44.080 --> 56:45.240
I know what I want to call it.

56:45.240 --> 56:47.280
I know what I want to call it.

56:47.280 --> 56:48.960
Thank you everybody for being here.

56:48.960 --> 56:53.240
Colonel, did you want to get your Linux story in before we wrap up today?

56:53.240 --> 56:54.240
Yeah.

56:54.240 --> 57:00.280
So one of my classes in college, the professor said, no, you can't write things in LibreOffice.

57:00.280 --> 57:02.600
You have to do it in Word.

57:02.600 --> 57:09.760
And because I would save things out in the 1003 Word format and he's like, no, you can't

57:09.760 --> 57:10.760
do that.

57:10.760 --> 57:15.040
And I go, okay, here's the requirements for the class because all at my college, all of

57:15.040 --> 57:19.560
the classes, they have a list of here's your required textbook and your required software

57:19.560 --> 57:22.440
and et cetera for a class.

57:22.440 --> 57:24.920
And I was like, where is it on this list?

57:24.920 --> 57:28.200
And he goes, well, I didn't put it on there because I thought everybody would just use

57:28.200 --> 57:32.120
Office and I go, well, when you want to put it on that list, which you can't change during

57:32.120 --> 57:35.320
the class, then okay, fine.

57:35.320 --> 57:39.040
And I basically said, screw him.

57:39.040 --> 57:44.680
And then the other one I've had is the way that I actually use Windows because I do have

57:44.680 --> 57:50.640
some classes that I actually have to take screenshots of Windows applications and stuff.

57:50.640 --> 57:57.160
And I have a VM of Windows that I install it, I activate it, I run the updates and that's

57:57.160 --> 57:58.160
it.

57:58.160 --> 58:03.520
And then I will clone it, take away its internet connection, do whatever configurations I need,

58:03.520 --> 58:07.880
use that for that semester and blow it away at the end of the semester.

58:07.880 --> 58:12.520
I have found that with Windows 10, if you take away its internet connection, it runs

58:12.520 --> 58:13.920
way better.

58:13.920 --> 58:15.840
All of a sudden it runs fine.

58:15.840 --> 58:19.240
But if you give it an internet connection, it hangs.

58:19.240 --> 58:21.880
That's classic, isn't it?

58:21.880 --> 58:26.160
All right, I have something I have to get off my chest.

58:26.160 --> 58:33.080
The Fedora experiment has come to an end on the ThinkPad and it's running Arch again and

58:33.080 --> 58:34.080
it's glorious.

58:34.080 --> 58:39.020
I thought I'd make it to 34, but it simply just came down to software availability for

58:39.020 --> 58:45.000
Fedora is just not quite there for the kind of things that I need because I need these

58:45.000 --> 58:49.600
weird esoteric thing that maybe only a couple of hundred people have.

58:49.600 --> 58:51.640
So Chris, what?

58:51.640 --> 58:52.640
You could have used the snap.

58:52.640 --> 58:56.960
No, no, I can't because the snap supports an older version of Jack, Jack one and I need

58:56.960 --> 58:57.960
Jack two support.

58:57.960 --> 58:59.600
But you see, it's not just that.

58:59.600 --> 59:00.680
It's not one piece of software.

59:00.680 --> 59:05.240
So Sonobus is what Neil's referring to, but it's actually several pieces of software.

59:05.240 --> 59:09.760
And it's just that, and I, what I will do is next time I take a go at Fedora, what I

59:09.760 --> 59:15.080
will do is I will, I will first learn how to make a copper repository for the software

59:15.080 --> 59:16.080
that I need.

59:16.080 --> 59:18.200
Oh my gosh, you're going to finally do it?

59:18.200 --> 59:20.560
Well, because that's clearly the missing piece.

59:20.560 --> 59:22.080
I think you have to at this point.

59:22.080 --> 59:24.840
Either you engage with the packaging system.

59:24.840 --> 59:29.680
We were chatting with Drew last night and there was no Sonobus package at all for Fedora.

59:29.680 --> 59:33.400
It's kind of sad too, because it's this incredible new piece of production software and Fedora

59:33.400 --> 59:34.760
is totally left out.

59:34.760 --> 59:37.240
And Drew just coppered it up and has it ready to go.

59:37.240 --> 59:41.640
And he's able to do that with the tools that he needs for all of his production stuff to

59:41.640 --> 59:43.000
make Fedora work for him.

59:43.000 --> 59:47.200
And he's had to do a considerable amount of the lifting on his own, but it seems like

59:47.200 --> 59:49.240
it's doable.

59:49.240 --> 59:54.480
My only concern is that I feel like it's likely to be one of those tasks where there is a

59:54.480 --> 59:59.720
variable amount of effort, i.e. some things are going to be a real pain in the butt to

59:59.720 --> 01:00:03.680
copper up and other things are going to be really straightforward and simple.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:08.320
And fundamentally what it comes down to is justifying how I spend my time.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:13.320
Because I could spend my time figuring out how complicated this weird esoteric audio

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:21.200
recorder for pulse is, or I could just yay-s audio-recorder and I have it and I can record

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:25.280
the stream that I already have up on my computer paused waiting to get recorded.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.240
And that's where at the end of the day it just doesn't end up working out for me, because

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:33.160
I do that math and I think I need to learn how to do these things so that way I can bring

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.160
software over.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:39.080
But even if I learn, I'm not going to stop mid-flow of a task that is to accomplish something

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.440
else for a production, just so that way I can then package an application so that way

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.960
I can use it on the esoteric distribution that I've chosen to use when I can either

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:53.480
just run Ubuntu or I could run Arch or any of the Ubuntu derivatives, obviously, and

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:58.280
the problem is preemptively solved for me and it saves me time at multiple iterations

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.400
because every time a package comes up, like this thing we just talked about today, already

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:06.480
available in the AUR, I can install it right now and I can have an opinion about it on

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.360
the show, I can actually have hands-on experience with something, or I can spend my time packaging

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.440
and it just doesn't really seem to make sense to me.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.200
It's not that I don't want to learn how to do it, it's just that's the math of the situation

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.200
right now.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:25.120
Sure, but Chris, you could also, when you're making those copper things, you could also

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.920
just reference the AUR package build files to be able to speed through actually making

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:30.920
them.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.920
So how does that work?

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.280
Tell me about that, because that might be like the hack to make it work, because if

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.800
it's in the AUR, then I have a shortcut, it sounds like.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.000
You can't necessarily, at least right now, take a package build file and just run it

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
and it produces you an RPM.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.920
However, a package build file and an RPM spec file look very similar in structure, and in

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:58.040
many cases what you can do is that you can do vim foo.spec and it'll generate you the

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.080
template because vim has a built-in template for RPM spec files, and you can literally

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.080
just copy and paste a lot of the commands that are run to actually just go ahead and

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.760
build it and push it into copper.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:16.960
It'll build it, produce you an RPM, and have a repo that you can show off to others or

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.160
have other people reference or whatever, and they can run it.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.920
Moreover, you can actually build it for multiple releases of Fedora.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:29.000
You can even technically use copper to build for OpenSUSE if you'd like.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.520
It's not exactly the same, it's not exactly completely zero effort, but it can get you

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.460
through it fairly quickly.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.900
So here's kind of another element of this.

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.640
It's like what speed are you operating at, I feel like.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:46.720
For another example is something I've kind of been talking about on Coder Radio and the

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:52.200
live stream for this show is performance and getting my machine faster and maybe getting

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:58.660
a faster refresh rate on my monitor and experimenting with the Profile Sync Demon to get my browser

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:05.080
to cache into RAM, messing around with maybe different types of schedulers or things like

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.080
that.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:12.840
And it all seems like it's infinitely easier on Arch than it is on Fedora or other desktops.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:18.680
And I know I heard your recent tirade about how dangerous Arch is, and frankly I can't

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:19.680
have it.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:24.900
I can't accept that because I'm sitting here, somebody who has enough knowledge to put together

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:30.040
a box, but ultimately I just want the tool that saves me time, and I swear right now

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:35.760
to you on the mixer sitting in front of me that if Fedora could save me time and make

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:41.600
it possible for me to get my job done faster than Arch, I 100% unequivocally with no doubt

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.580
would use it on every single machine I have.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.840
And it started with my workstation, I tried it there and on my laptop, and over time even

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:52.700
though I struggled not to do it because I didn't want to make the concession, I eventually

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:58.360
had to replace it simply because what I want to spend my time on is experimenting with

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.840
this software and trying things, or recording that clip, or getting that editing software,

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:08.320
or quickly installing this esoteric branch of the kernel to try it for a week so I can

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.320
talk about it on the show.

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.600
And I don't want to spend my time figuring out how to go set up a copper account, and

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.840
how to go wire this hard work that somebody's already done to get it in there.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.360
None of that sounds appealing to me right now.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.220
And I cannot be the only one who has this opinion.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:30.100
And so you can denigrate Arch for being rolling and for maybe being unsafe for new users,

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:34.100
but for people like me who have been using Linux since the 90s, and I just want a damn

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:38.320
workstation that I don't have to fuss with just to get some piece of software going,

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:39.320
it's very appealing.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.280
And I feel like it doesn't get the credit.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:47.040
Instead we laugh at, oh I run Arch by the way, and we actually have now kind of ganged

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:51.780
up on Arch users for being so crazy to run a distribution that they don't have to go

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:53.960
through an upgrade cycle every six months.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:57.340
And I feel like it's kind of unfair because it turns out to make an incredibly powerful

01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:01.260
workstation if you're remotely comfortable with using Linux.

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:04.300
And then on top of that they have really good documentation.

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:10.180
And then if you just go to the AUR and you sort by the most popular applications, you

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:14.080
just see it's people trying to solve problems to get their work done.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.980
And that's who's installing software from the AUR.

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.420
It's things like Slack and Zoom.

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.400
It's not this weird crazy stuff.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.660
It's just people trying to get their jobs done during the day.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:31.760
And I kind of feel like we have cast Arch users as if they're these dangerous influencers

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.020
who are going to derail new user adoption and prevent Linux from taking off.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:39.900
And the only way to save them is because package managers will come in and protect them from

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.740
the dangerous rolling releases.

01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:46.340
And it's just a shame because I struggled with this, and I didn't because of this opinion,

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.400
and I didn't know how to tackle this on air.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.980
And I feel like it produces like this boogeyman out there.

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:56.240
And it creates a parody of Linux users, and it's just unfortunate.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.240
End of rant.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.240
Okay.

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:02.160
First of all, Chris, I don't have a problem with you running Arch.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:06.640
I am disappointed when you run Arch because it feels like I failed in trying to make things

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.600
work out well in Fedora for you.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:17.160
But I don't particularly care to make you feel bad or whatever for it.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.460
That's not my point.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:24.600
My problem with talking about Arch in a lot of sense, like the nuance here is there are

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:30.360
a lot of people who don't know anything about anything about Linux who try to use Arch because

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.100
everyone else talks about it as if Arch is easy.

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.260
I guess I reject that premise.

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:39.840
And I think that that premise, which I don't think can be proved, leads to denigrating

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.960
Arch users and making it actually almost embarrassing to admit that you run Arch.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:48.420
I grant you that in a theoretical world where new people were coming to Linux and they were

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:53.520
somehow discovering Arch on their brand new journey, thanks to the magic of Google, that

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.640
would be a problem.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:59.160
But I just don't really accept that based just solely on the user base numbers of Ubuntu

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.160
and Mint alone.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.920
I'm not saying it's happening universally.

01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.260
I'm saying it happens in places like R, Linux.

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:09.200
It even happens in my workplace Slack where people say, you know, Arch is easy, so just

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.200
go do it.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:14.140
And then I have people telling me that Arch, because of their experience with Arch, that

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:17.360
they hate Linux and they just go back to Windows or Mac OS.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:23.760
I don't care that you find Arch more comfortable.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.320
That's fine if that's the case.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:29.600
I would like to make Fedora better for your use case because I feel you are actually one

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.600
of those people.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:35.120
I also want to tackle this other thing where you said, well, you know, these people working

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.580
in AUR, they're all people trying to solve problems.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:38.580
You know what?

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.760
That's pretty much everybody working in every Linux distribution, doing everything that

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.780
they're doing.

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.120
That's why Copper exists.

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.560
That's why Launchpad exists.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.400
That's why, you know, PPAs.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.400
That's why OBS.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.400
That's why AUR.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.400
All of these systems are for that stuff.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:56.880
Not everything is going to have the required effort to put it into the main distribution.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.160
Would it be nice if they're all in there?

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.160
Sure.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.160
Would that happen?

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.160
No.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.560
And that's the reason that all that stuff is all there.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:10.640
If you take what you're doing and you take the equivalent of just slap together a package

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:14.160
build and call it good and everything's available, you're going to do the same thing and say,

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.880
I'll slap together a spec file and push it up and call it good.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.800
The only difference between AUR and Copper in that respect is one of them you're building

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.360
locally on your computer and the other one you're not.

01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:31.720
And my thing about Arch versus everything else is that Arch is very developer centric

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:38.320
and the Arch user community themselves have been historically very inhospitable to folks

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.760
who are very new to the Linux ecosystem.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.160
Whether or not that actually winds up being true in your circle, that's a different story.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:47.680
Whether it turns out to be true in the macrocosm, that's a different story.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:52.040
So I think that would be good if the experience for new users when they come to Arch is somewhat

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.560
of a hostile response, that's probably the signal to the new user that that's not the

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.560
community for them.

01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:59.920
So that probably kind of reinforces what I say, where it's not really the new user distribution

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:00.920
where they land.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.200
And here's what I'm kind of getting at, because I actually do, I agree with everything you

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:08.720
just said, but where I think it kind of goes off the rails, and this is what gets me kind

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.540
of fired up about it, is because this is where then I struggle with how to talk about this

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:19.680
on air, is fundamentally I think we have created this shame dome for Arch users.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:25.080
And it's kind of become like this joke, but in reality, we're shaming people.

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:29.800
We're shaming people for choosing to use a distribution, and that's the bit I don't like.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.580
I mean, you can make a solid argument for why somebody would want to land on a distribution

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:37.920
that is managed versus a distribution that's kind of like a Wild West.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.920
That I don't disagree with.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:44.180
But what I disagree with is the characterization that A, it's hostile to new users, it's not

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:49.180
for new users, and I don't want to get into a situation where we're advocating to dumb

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:53.320
down tools to appease a theoretical user base.

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:56.920
I feel like tools should be as powerful as they can be, and then it's up to the distros

01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.200
to create something that's palatable to new users.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:04.840
And there is a market for each kind of user, and so we shouldn't shame people if they choose

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:09.180
to run Gen 2, like we laugh at them now if they run Gen 2 or Arch, because it's solving

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:10.340
a problem for them.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:17.040
And just like Fedora and Ubuntu and Mandrake and Mandriva and OpenSUSE and you know, etc.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.520
And so that's where I feel like we kind of got to right the ship a little bit, is this

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.620
anti-rhetoric against Arch users is kind of becoming more and more hostile.

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:32.460
And to the point where I realized I didn't even want to admit that I was using it more

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:33.460
and more.

01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:36.960
And that I would maybe talk up more about this distro than I would admit that I'm using

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:40.800
Arch simply because of this community shaming that's happening.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.960
And I feel like that's what has to stop, because there's completely valid work problems it's

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:46.960
solving for me.

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:50.920
It seems confused too when like Neil, you spoke about being upset when people make Arch

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:51.920
seem easy.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:57.860
There's certainly problems there, but it seems like in a lot of Linux media, that becomes

01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.040
the focus.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:03.720
And it's when we're often a community of folks that are not new users and are experienced

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.360
and we're trying to have one conversation, but it gets dominated by this idea that some

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:10.200
folks out there are leading people astray with Arch.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:14.160
And we can be upset at that without having to be upset about the happy community of Arch

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.160
users who are talking amongst themselves.
