WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
Okay, all right, so I wanna talk about

00:02.960 --> 00:05.360
tools that we can't live without.

00:05.360 --> 00:09.220
So today started a very interesting day.

00:09.220 --> 00:13.480
I woke up and the first thing that happened

00:13.480 --> 00:16.440
was every device in the house is going off with alerts.

00:16.440 --> 00:20.920
And the alert was that my kids are not going to school today

00:20.920 --> 00:22.200
because they can't in school.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.660
Okay, all right, that's fine.

00:23.660 --> 00:25.840
And then the next set of alerts

00:25.840 --> 00:28.360
were all of the places that are closed,

00:28.360 --> 00:30.760
the city offices and stuff like that.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.800
And then the alerts after all of that

00:32.800 --> 00:34.000
were in our ticketing system

00:34.000 --> 00:36.480
where a bunch of businesses were like,

00:36.480 --> 00:38.320
well, we're not open today.

00:38.320 --> 00:39.920
This would be a great day to rip out

00:39.920 --> 00:41.800
key parts of our infrastructure and replace it

00:41.800 --> 00:43.080
because we're not gonna be using them.

00:43.080 --> 00:43.920
Of course.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.040
So yeah, so my day is quickly filling up.

00:47.040 --> 00:50.040
And I thought, okay, well, I need to prepare

00:50.040 --> 00:51.480
for Linux Unplugged today.

00:51.480 --> 00:54.040
And I need some time to get everything set up in the studio.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.080
So I'm gonna get in my car,

00:55.080 --> 00:56.040
I'm gonna go drive to the studio

00:56.040 --> 00:57.540
and I'll take care of that.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.800
Well, I step out of my front door

00:59.800 --> 01:04.800
and my foot just goes about a foot down.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.080
And there's like a foot of snow, yeah.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.040
And so I'm not taking my car.

01:09.040 --> 01:12.800
I'm gonna go to the Jeep, take the Jeep, go to back out.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.280
I cannot get out of my driveway

01:14.280 --> 01:17.340
because the snow plow has come down the street

01:17.340 --> 01:20.040
and pushed all the snow that's in the street

01:20.040 --> 01:20.880
into my driveway.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.520
Nicely building a blockade for you.

01:22.520 --> 01:25.080
Yeah, now I can't get into the driveway at all.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.040
So I think, all right,

01:26.040 --> 01:27.200
so I'm gonna go start the snow blower

01:27.200 --> 01:28.560
and I will blow out my driveway,

01:28.560 --> 01:31.040
then I will get into my car, then I will drive to work

01:31.040 --> 01:32.320
and then I will fix all the problems

01:32.320 --> 01:35.200
so that I can then go start Linux Unplugged.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.720
Snow blower doesn't start.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.580
Now there's something wrong with the carburetor.

01:38.580 --> 01:40.520
So I'm not gonna work on the carburetor

01:40.520 --> 01:44.200
in 15 degree weather with 40 mile an hour wind

01:44.200 --> 01:46.480
buried in snow, you drop parts, you lose them.

01:46.480 --> 01:48.400
So the only thing I can do

01:48.400 --> 01:50.400
is I take the snow blower into my kitchen,

01:50.400 --> 01:52.040
which my wife is thrilled about.

01:52.040 --> 01:55.640
So I'm disassembling this carburetor in my kitchen.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.480
I clean the carburetor,

01:56.480 --> 01:57.920
I get everything put back together

01:57.920 --> 02:00.840
and I'm not gonna take it outside and test it

02:00.840 --> 02:02.040
only to find out something doesn't work

02:02.040 --> 02:02.880
and bring it back in, right?

02:02.880 --> 02:04.520
Yeah, right, like bundle up just to go outside, test it.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.240
So I put some gas in and I start it up

02:08.240 --> 02:09.060
and it starts right up.

02:09.060 --> 02:10.200
So I did a good job fixing the carburetor

02:10.200 --> 02:12.780
but then it dawns on me that exhaust

02:12.780 --> 02:14.440
is going pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop

02:14.440 --> 02:17.680
and just like every puff is just filling the kitchen.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.480
Well, I don't wanna shut the snow blower off

02:19.480 --> 02:22.440
because I just spent three hours getting it started.

02:22.440 --> 02:26.080
So I take my snow blower running through my house

02:26.080 --> 02:29.060
and push it out the door, blow out the driveway

02:29.060 --> 02:32.120
and eventually I end up,

02:32.120 --> 02:34.080
a bunch of other bad things happen too.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.080
Right, that was obstacle one of many.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.760
Yeah, that was obstacle one of like 10, right.

02:38.760 --> 02:39.880
But it made me start to think,

02:39.880 --> 02:42.100
what are tools that we can't live without?

02:42.100 --> 02:44.000
Today for me, it was a snow blower.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.840
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 174

02:47.840 --> 02:49.900
for December 6th, 2016.

02:49.900 --> 03:05.480
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

03:05.480 --> 03:08.000
that fought the weather, sacrificed a laptop

03:08.000 --> 03:10.600
and built a computer all within the last hour

03:10.600 --> 03:12.360
to be here with you today.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.520
My name is Noah and joining me remotely

03:14.520 --> 03:16.560
from Seattle this time is Wes.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.400
Hey Wes, how are you?

03:17.400 --> 03:18.960
Hey guys.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.120
I'm doing great, it's a pleasure to be with you here.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.720
Thank you for being the host today.

03:22.720 --> 03:23.760
Okay, I'll be honest with you,

03:23.760 --> 03:26.640
I appreciate the effort you took to be here

03:26.640 --> 03:29.680
but let's be honest, I put in more effort to be here today.

03:29.680 --> 03:30.720
I do think that's fair.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.440
It sounds like you had quite the day, Noah.

03:32.440 --> 03:33.960
I almost died.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.680
Like basically like that followed me.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.880
Yeah, that's just almost followed me.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.360
That's bad for the network.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.440
At every turn, it was crazy.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.640
Do you know what I am excited about though, Wes?

03:42.640 --> 03:44.880
I bet it's our giant show today.

03:44.880 --> 03:48.240
Our giant show that revolves around Linux.

03:48.240 --> 03:52.200
And specifically Fedora, we're gonna be talking with,

03:52.200 --> 03:53.760
we're gonna be talking about Fedora

03:53.760 --> 03:55.480
and some potential changes they're making.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.560
Now, these are speculation.

03:57.560 --> 03:58.940
It's just speculation at this point.

03:58.940 --> 04:02.360
There's no confirmed, there's no confirmation

04:02.360 --> 04:04.220
that any of this is going to happen.

04:04.220 --> 04:08.080
And it is possible that Matt Miller might stop by.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.880
We spoke with him and he thought he might have some time

04:09.880 --> 04:12.640
and so he might be here with us later in the show

04:12.640 --> 04:14.080
to talk about some of the speculation

04:14.080 --> 04:15.860
and what Fedora is up to.

04:15.860 --> 04:20.480
So, quick recap, I have been a Fedora user

04:20.480 --> 04:23.560
since version Uno, since the very first version of Fedora.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.560
Basically forever.

04:24.560 --> 04:29.200
Yes, I was using Red Hat back when it was Red Hat

04:29.200 --> 04:30.360
and then they did the split

04:30.360 --> 04:33.200
and they did RHEL, Red Hat Enterprise Linux

04:33.200 --> 04:34.160
and they did Fedora.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.040
And I was there when that split happened

04:36.040 --> 04:39.380
and I have used every single version of Fedora

04:39.380 --> 04:40.920
from Fedora one on up.

04:40.920 --> 04:45.920
Now, somewhere around Fedora, 2021-ish, somewhere in there,

04:48.040 --> 04:52.040
the direction of my company started to push me

04:52.040 --> 04:53.120
in a direction that required me

04:53.120 --> 04:55.340
to use a little bit more Ubuntu.

04:55.340 --> 05:00.120
And so, I hate distro hopping inside of my own home.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.780
I hate having one computer that works one way

05:01.780 --> 05:02.860
and one computer that works the other way

05:02.860 --> 05:03.700
in different software.

05:03.700 --> 05:04.880
It's hard to have that inconsistency

05:04.880 --> 05:06.200
in your day-to-day life.

05:06.200 --> 05:07.040
It is.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.120
And when you sit down to do something,

05:09.120 --> 05:10.880
I want things to work the same.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.360
And so, I had kind of moved myself

05:13.360 --> 05:15.360
a little bit away to Ubuntu

05:15.360 --> 05:19.640
but my main big workhorse downstairs always ran Fedora.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.880
The thing I did most of my work on had always run Fedora.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.680
And recently, I wiped every computer I owned,

05:26.680 --> 05:28.940
at least that I use personally, and put Arch on them.

05:28.940 --> 05:30.440
You can follow that in the Linux action show.

05:30.440 --> 05:31.840
We talked about it a couple different times.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.320
Some of the challenges I ran into.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.420
But I still had a Fedora machine

05:36.420 --> 05:39.600
and upgraded that recently to Fedora 25.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.320
And again, you can check out our review of Fedora 25

05:42.320 --> 05:43.400
in Linux action show.

05:44.620 --> 05:49.120
But my real reason for going to Arch over Fedora

05:51.500 --> 05:54.520
was the update cycle.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.440
And I got a lot of criticism from that.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.120
A lot of people wrote in, they said,

05:59.120 --> 06:00.800
you're complaining about the Fedora

06:00.800 --> 06:04.240
six-month support cycle, but you went to Arch,

06:04.240 --> 06:06.800
which literally has like a one-day support.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.160
I mean, every day there's new updates

06:09.160 --> 06:10.000
and you have to push them, right?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.640
So it doesn't seem to be very consistent.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.360
The problem is, and I spoke about this

06:14.360 --> 06:17.720
in our last review of Fedora, I don't trust their updates.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.060
I don't trust updating from one version to the next,

06:20.060 --> 06:20.900
upgrading, I should say.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.920
So for you, it then means a reinstall.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.440
It does, it means a Nuke and pay.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.520
And the obvious problem with doing that

06:28.520 --> 06:31.000
is I don't have time to Nuke and pay my system

06:31.000 --> 06:33.640
every six months or every year even.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.800
I could do it every five years,

06:35.800 --> 06:37.440
but I'm not willing to do it every year.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.720
In fact, really, to be perfectly honest,

06:39.720 --> 06:42.360
I probably get a new laptop every five years.

06:42.360 --> 06:47.360
So I have always wanted Fedora to go to an LTS-like version

06:49.800 --> 06:53.240
and there hasn't, and at the same time,

06:53.240 --> 06:55.040
there's a lot of people that have been pushing

06:55.040 --> 07:00.040
for the Fedora project to go the rolling style,

07:00.520 --> 07:02.280
which I have questioned because I don't know

07:02.280 --> 07:04.240
where Fedora would fit in then,

07:04.240 --> 07:07.360
especially when you kind of compare that to Arch, right?

07:07.360 --> 07:08.520
It might change its place

07:08.520 --> 07:10.720
in the Linux distribution ecosystem.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.360
The folks at Red Hat will tell you

07:13.360 --> 07:17.280
that Fedora is bleeding edge, and I don't agree.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.440
I think Fedora is leading edge,

07:19.440 --> 07:20.960
and I would classify something like Arch

07:20.960 --> 07:22.580
as truly bleeding edge.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.280
And so to take Fedora to rolling,

07:26.280 --> 07:27.720
I don't know that that makes a lot of sense,

07:27.720 --> 07:28.740
but I know there's a lot of people

07:28.740 --> 07:31.440
that would like to see that project take that route.

07:31.440 --> 07:36.440
Now, Matt Miller wrote a phenomenal post

07:36.440 --> 07:38.380
on a mailing list here.

07:39.720 --> 07:44.720
And basically, he talks about how he's really pushing

07:46.400 --> 07:51.300
for a change in the release cadence of Fedora.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.000
And if I'm understanding this right,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.800
and I've done a little bit of research,

07:55.800 --> 07:57.560
if I'm understanding this right,

07:57.560 --> 08:00.660
there are two major changes that would be occurring.

08:00.660 --> 08:05.660
The first would be that raw hide

08:06.340 --> 08:10.740
is going to become the gated rolling release,

08:10.740 --> 08:14.020
and the release will deviate,

08:15.740 --> 08:17.980
he says, and the release deviate from it

08:17.980 --> 08:20.500
by stability and life cycle.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.400
This is essentially what SUSE has done

08:22.400 --> 08:24.640
with Tumbleweed and Leap respectively.

08:25.720 --> 08:28.060
So my understanding is they're going to break it off

08:28.060 --> 08:33.060
and have essentially two Fedora versions.

08:33.460 --> 08:34.860
He goes on to write and he says,

08:34.860 --> 08:37.060
what if instead of a two year release cycle,

08:37.060 --> 08:42.060
we updated the core on a cycle aligned with the kernel,

08:42.340 --> 08:44.100
so roughly every three months,

08:44.100 --> 08:47.140
and had just one June release of Fedora workstation

08:47.140 --> 08:49.500
and Fedora server every year,

08:49.500 --> 08:53.660
with an optional one update in November or December.

08:53.660 --> 08:56.940
Fedora would keep its two week updates

08:56.940 --> 08:58.160
as a rolling release.

08:59.300 --> 09:01.720
This seems huge to me.

09:03.060 --> 09:05.540
I'm interested to see what you think, Les.

09:05.540 --> 09:06.740
Yeah, it does sound,

09:06.740 --> 09:09.300
it is a very different model of how to do it.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.460
I do kind of like that cycle aligned with the kernel.

09:11.460 --> 09:14.580
It seems to work well for the kernel community.

09:14.580 --> 09:16.380
Obviously there's a big difference between a distribution

09:16.380 --> 09:17.500
and releasing the kernel,

09:17.500 --> 09:19.660
especially not necessarily the LTS kernel

09:19.660 --> 09:20.760
or anything like that.

09:22.180 --> 09:24.900
But I do appreciate how much the Fedora represents

09:24.900 --> 09:27.980
kind of Linux next on the desktop, in the gnome world,

09:27.980 --> 09:29.440
a lot of things like that.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.740
System tools that they had system D early,

09:31.740 --> 09:34.080
they have Wayland now.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.020
And so it would kind of,

09:35.020 --> 09:36.980
I could see myself doing that.

09:36.980 --> 09:38.260
It's not quite the burden of Arch,

09:38.260 --> 09:41.980
it's not that model,

09:41.980 --> 09:44.740
but it does give you fresh packages, fresh kernels.

09:44.740 --> 09:47.260
It seems like a really good thing to build a workstation

09:47.260 --> 09:48.340
where you're willing to update,

09:48.340 --> 09:50.660
but you want new tools and you want the new hotness.

09:50.660 --> 09:52.140
Right, right, exactly.

09:52.140 --> 09:56.420
And the thing is, and I struggle with this from time to time

09:56.420 --> 09:58.940
because sometimes I struggle to really articulate

09:58.940 --> 10:01.980
why I value this.

10:01.980 --> 10:06.580
But to me, there is an inherent value in having a company

10:06.580 --> 10:09.860
that's backed by a billion dollars or more really.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.740
I think they're approaching 2 billion

10:11.740 --> 10:13.500
or they've made 2 billion,

10:13.500 --> 10:16.260
backing the Linux distribution that you're using.

10:16.260 --> 10:18.660
And if I could go into a client and say, look,

10:19.740 --> 10:21.300
cause I mean, here's the reality.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.940
We can fight about distributions all day long.

10:23.940 --> 10:26.660
Nobody has ever gotten fired for putting RHEL on a server.

10:26.660 --> 10:31.340
They are, in 2016, they are like the IBM of computers.

10:31.340 --> 10:35.140
So 15 years ago, you bought an IBM computer

10:35.140 --> 10:37.300
and you sold somebody IBM computers

10:37.300 --> 10:38.920
and you stuck them in their office.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.460
Nobody ever got fired for doing that.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.940
That was just, that was a very sensible, solid choice.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.500
And RHEL keeps that.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.240
There's an expense associated with it,

10:46.240 --> 10:47.980
but it's a good, solid choice

10:47.980 --> 10:49.560
from a technical perspective.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.500
Now, if I could go into a client and say, look,

10:51.500 --> 10:54.020
you have, you know, whatever, 15, 20, you know,

10:54.020 --> 10:55.460
the University of New York, Dakota, for example,

10:55.460 --> 10:58.000
has a cluster of Red Hat servers, right?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.520
If I could go in there and say, look,

10:59.520 --> 11:02.340
you guys are running Red Hat on these servers,

11:02.340 --> 11:06.220
the same company will back a distribution

11:06.220 --> 11:08.240
that is designed for the desktop.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.980
One of the things I hear all the time

11:10.980 --> 11:14.100
when we get in, when we have this discussion is,

11:14.100 --> 11:15.860
well, why don't you just use Red Hat on the desktop?

11:15.860 --> 11:18.220
Why don't you just use CentOS on the desktop?

11:18.220 --> 11:21.100
And the reality is, the distribution

11:21.100 --> 11:23.340
is not tailored for desktop use.

11:23.340 --> 11:25.500
It does, it's not easy to install things like VLC.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.040
It's not easy to install things like, you know,

11:29.140 --> 11:30.700
I don't know specifically because I haven't tried,

11:30.700 --> 11:33.460
but I know VLC is a huge pain point,

11:33.460 --> 11:36.460
but it is just not optimized for desktop applications

11:36.460 --> 11:39.020
because it's not designed to be a desktop operating system.

11:39.020 --> 11:40.420
It's designed to be a workstation.

11:40.420 --> 11:41.260
Sure, right.

11:41.260 --> 11:42.540
Yeah, maybe, yeah, work fine,

11:42.540 --> 11:44.320
maybe where you're running, you know, instrumentation

11:44.320 --> 11:46.520
for a scientific tool or machine tool,

11:46.520 --> 11:48.900
but not for something that end users need to use.

11:48.900 --> 11:50.380
They might need to use the tool of the day,

11:50.380 --> 11:52.060
whatever's popular.

11:52.060 --> 11:53.660
You know, calculations, stuff like that,

11:53.660 --> 11:56.380
that workstations will, the workstation will do fine.

11:56.380 --> 11:57.820
Photo editing, video editing,

11:57.820 --> 11:59.580
like installing Lightworks, for example.

11:59.580 --> 12:01.300
We're talking about that in the pre-show, right?

12:01.300 --> 12:03.460
Installing Lightworks on CentOS,

12:03.460 --> 12:06.460
I will get no help from Red Hat because it's,

12:06.460 --> 12:07.700
they're gonna say that's not what it's for,

12:07.700 --> 12:10.100
and I will get no help from EditShare.

12:10.100 --> 12:13.980
So using the, so we can rule out using Red Hat

12:13.980 --> 12:18.180
on the desktop, except for extremely rare circumstances.

12:19.060 --> 12:21.960
We need a enterprise grade desktop, though,

12:21.960 --> 12:23.860
that we can use, and right now,

12:23.860 --> 12:25.420
I don't feel like we have it.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.700
That should be the promise of Ubuntu,

12:27.700 --> 12:32.140
but every release of Ubuntu seems to be getting worse.

12:32.140 --> 12:34.220
Either they don't move forward at all,

12:34.220 --> 12:37.360
or in the case of 16.04, they break key components

12:37.360 --> 12:39.620
that I need to make the desktop work, i.e. wireless.

12:39.620 --> 12:41.220
I don't have wireless in 16.04,

12:41.220 --> 12:44.100
and that wasn't fixed in 16.10.

12:44.100 --> 12:49.100
So the prospect that Fedora would be moving to a system

12:50.700 --> 12:53.580
in which we would have two versions,

12:53.580 --> 12:56.240
one would be kind of LTS-like,

12:56.240 --> 12:57.980
and the other would be rolling,

12:57.980 --> 13:00.480
seems brilliant for a couple of reasons.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.580
One of the things that originally drew me to Fedora

13:03.580 --> 13:06.420
was that I could find out what was going to happen

13:06.420 --> 13:08.860
on the server on my desktop first,

13:08.860 --> 13:11.100
and play with it, and experience the pain,

13:11.100 --> 13:12.820
and then watch those problems get resolved,

13:12.820 --> 13:14.620
and then when it went into production,

13:14.620 --> 13:15.980
we were all ready for that.

13:15.980 --> 13:17.100
If I could do the same thing,

13:17.100 --> 13:20.140
I could run rolling on my laptop,

13:20.140 --> 13:22.820
but put my clients on the LTS version,

13:22.820 --> 13:25.220
or whatever they call it, that would be huge.

13:25.220 --> 13:26.500
That would be game-changing.

13:26.500 --> 13:30.460
And I'll make a vow right now, Linux Unplugged,

13:30.460 --> 13:33.340
at 4.37 in the afternoon Central Time,

13:33.340 --> 13:37.220
if Red Hat decides to do this,

13:37.220 --> 13:41.700
even if it's a year or two year support.

13:41.700 --> 13:42.720
It'd have to be more than that though,

13:42.720 --> 13:44.760
because I can't reinstall every year.

13:44.760 --> 13:48.460
But if we could get anything above like two years,

13:48.460 --> 13:50.580
I'll switch every computer I own back to Fedora.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.100
100% of them will run Fedora,

13:52.100 --> 13:55.020
and 100% of my servers will continue to run CentOS.

13:55.020 --> 13:56.220
What do you think, Wes?

13:57.140 --> 13:58.480
You know, that does sound interesting.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.100
I'm also struck by some parallels

14:00.100 --> 14:01.980
in terms of some of the benefits here.

14:01.980 --> 14:05.300
They talk about more time for QA and release engineering.

14:05.300 --> 14:07.740
I know like in the software industry,

14:07.740 --> 14:08.700
we have seen that as well,

14:08.700 --> 14:10.180
a push towards continuous integration,

14:10.180 --> 14:12.020
a push towards continuous delivery,

14:12.020 --> 14:14.100
where you're adding, you have small changes,

14:14.100 --> 14:15.340
but you're iterating quickly,

14:15.340 --> 14:16.860
but when you make those changes,

14:16.860 --> 14:17.700
they're fresh in your mind,

14:17.700 --> 14:20.220
you can go fix them as soon as you notice problems.

14:20.220 --> 14:24.040
So that strikes me as something that may be beneficial.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.860
I don't know what we'll see out of that LTS,

14:26.860 --> 14:28.780
but I could see if they're continuously working,

14:28.780 --> 14:29.620
they're getting better,

14:29.620 --> 14:32.060
and then are able to kind of cherry pick,

14:32.060 --> 14:33.020
all right, here we go,

14:33.020 --> 14:34.860
this is a great stack that we've got ourselves on,

14:34.860 --> 14:35.920
we found ourselves in a really good place,

14:35.920 --> 14:39.260
everything's working well, support this for some time.

14:39.260 --> 14:42.100
It might work better than the release model now,

14:42.100 --> 14:43.580
which it seems like maybe they've struggled with

14:43.580 --> 14:45.260
a little bit, they're not always released,

14:45.260 --> 14:47.100
you know, we've talked a lot about on this network,

14:47.100 --> 14:48.340
a lot about like, you know,

14:48.340 --> 14:49.480
after a couple of weeks or a month,

14:49.480 --> 14:50.660
then yes, it's really solid,

14:50.660 --> 14:51.860
you've got everything that you can use.

14:51.860 --> 14:53.180
If we can get away from that,

14:53.180 --> 14:54.980
it seems like it'd be a good thing.

14:54.980 --> 14:55.980
I agree.

14:55.980 --> 14:57.740
Mumble Room, what do you guys think?

14:58.980 --> 15:01.200
Well, I mean, it kind of sounds like

15:01.200 --> 15:03.860
the same thing OpenSUSE has been doing for a year.

15:03.860 --> 15:04.700
Yeah, it does.

15:06.140 --> 15:07.100
What do you think about,

15:07.100 --> 15:11.580
so you are or were an OpenSUSE user,

15:11.580 --> 15:16.220
I believe you're using KDE Neon right now, right?

15:16.220 --> 15:18.220
Yeah, I'm using Neon now.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.000
What do you think of the comparison

15:20.000 --> 15:23.780
between the company that backs Suice Linux

15:23.780 --> 15:26.340
and the company that backs Fedora?

15:26.340 --> 15:28.580
How do you draw that parallel and say,

15:28.580 --> 15:30.460
well, or how do you view that and say,

15:30.460 --> 15:33.140
well, I trust this company more than that company,

15:33.140 --> 15:35.060
or I think this company does a better job

15:35.060 --> 15:38.860
at paying attention to the community than that one.

15:38.860 --> 15:40.340
Where do you fall on that?

15:40.340 --> 15:43.460
I think they both are pretty close in community aspects,

15:43.460 --> 15:45.240
and I think they're both fairly large

15:45.240 --> 15:48.740
in the sense of different parts of the world.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.620
Red Hat's more North America,

15:50.620 --> 15:54.240
whereas Europe is more dominated by SUSE.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.020
But the only thing I would say

15:56.020 --> 16:00.440
that makes me slightly hesitant of SUSE versus Red Hat

16:00.440 --> 16:02.720
is that Red Hat is owned by Red Hat,

16:02.720 --> 16:06.460
and SUSE is owned by who knows any of that right now.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.260
It's like Novell purchased them,

16:08.260 --> 16:10.340
and then that was then sold again,

16:10.340 --> 16:15.100
so it's kind of weird that that slight hesitation from that,

16:15.100 --> 16:18.900
but other than that, they're both solid in the same ways.

16:19.940 --> 16:24.940
Except for also, Fedora is not using rail packages.

16:25.780 --> 16:28.200
They even say that they're not compatible with each other.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.220
Oh, yes, right.

16:29.220 --> 16:31.820
OpenSUSE is actually using sleep packages,

16:31.820 --> 16:35.340
so you kind of have the more enterprise workstation

16:35.340 --> 16:38.420
type desktop with the OpenSUSE approach.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.460
I'll be very honest with you.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.540
About the time, and it was around,

16:42.540 --> 16:44.900
I'll tell you exactly when it was too, Fedora 15,

16:44.900 --> 16:48.100
about the time that they started to do this split

16:48.100 --> 16:51.620
where Fedora was no longer really going to be

16:51.620 --> 16:53.740
what the next version of RHEL is going to be,

16:53.740 --> 16:54.920
or you know, well, a couple of versions,

16:54.920 --> 16:57.660
because RHEL, you know, a couple years in between.

16:57.660 --> 16:59.620
About that time that they made that switch

16:59.620 --> 17:02.400
was about the time that Fedora started to become

17:02.400 --> 17:07.260
less appealing to me, and as a system administrator,

17:07.260 --> 17:08.580
that was something I really appreciated,

17:08.580 --> 17:11.380
so I thought that they gave up something huge,

17:11.380 --> 17:13.860
but at the same time, I think that it reflects well

17:13.860 --> 17:15.900
on Red Hat as a company that they are willing

17:15.900 --> 17:18.320
to let the Fedora team, the Fedora project,

17:18.320 --> 17:19.520
be its own project.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.700
It's not just the beta grounds for RHEL.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.060
It is its own distro.

17:24.060 --> 17:26.980
It's its own project, and so I think that reflects well

17:26.980 --> 17:29.780
on them, though from a corporate business,

17:29.780 --> 17:32.420
I need to make money, and this was a tool

17:32.420 --> 17:34.380
that I used to facilitate that.

17:34.380 --> 17:36.380
I was a little unhappy about it.

17:36.380 --> 17:40.080
Do you think that SUSE is becoming any less relevant?

17:41.180 --> 17:42.980
Actually, I think SUSE is becoming more relevant,

17:42.980 --> 17:46.060
specifically for their switch, their infrastructure

17:46.060 --> 17:49.060
of the leap and tumbleweed approach.

17:49.060 --> 17:52.220
Like, before those happened, which has only been a year,

17:52.220 --> 17:55.580
like, they've only had two leap releases,

17:55.580 --> 17:59.340
42.1 and 42.2, and that was only like a month ago

17:59.340 --> 18:00.740
they had the second release.

18:00.740 --> 18:02.820
Actually, less than a month, like three weeks ago.

18:02.820 --> 18:07.240
So they've been becoming much more and more

18:07.240 --> 18:11.260
getting attention and just more relevant in the community

18:11.260 --> 18:12.780
because of this massive change,

18:12.780 --> 18:14.740
because it is revolutionary at the time,

18:14.740 --> 18:17.820
and it's still, it's kind of like getting people

18:17.820 --> 18:21.060
to consider other things, and especially like

18:21.060 --> 18:24.080
their infrastructure of open QA.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.520
Like, there are people from Fedora saying

18:25.520 --> 18:28.140
that it's amazing, and they would love to use it,

18:28.140 --> 18:30.940
but it doesn't work for their stuff, so they don't.

18:30.940 --> 18:35.660
But if like more people hear about the stuff

18:35.660 --> 18:37.680
that OpenSUSE is doing, it's just gonna continue

18:37.680 --> 18:41.580
to improve in their, I guess, market share.

18:42.660 --> 18:45.340
Do you think that those changes that they're making

18:45.340 --> 18:49.140
and the ability to run that rolling

18:49.140 --> 18:52.060
or run more of a stable platform,

18:52.060 --> 18:56.260
do you think that that increases the saleability,

18:56.260 --> 18:58.320
so to speak, to businesses?

18:58.320 --> 18:59.620
Like if you're a new business,

18:59.620 --> 19:01.540
you're a new business, you're starting up,

19:01.540 --> 19:03.380
do you think that gives them a competitive advantage

19:03.380 --> 19:05.300
over other distributions?

19:05.300 --> 19:07.940
Absolutely, well, not only in certain cases,

19:07.940 --> 19:10.940
like as far as like server stuff,

19:10.940 --> 19:12.660
if you're gonna use SLE, that you can use,

19:12.660 --> 19:14.280
you can have that connection between your desktop

19:14.280 --> 19:16.660
and your enterprise, and your servers

19:16.660 --> 19:17.500
and all this other things.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.740
So you can have like your personal desktop,

19:19.740 --> 19:23.020
or you can have a rolling desktop that also uses SLE,

19:23.020 --> 19:26.340
and also some parts that SLE uses parts of Tumbleweed,

19:26.340 --> 19:27.180
things like that.

19:27.180 --> 19:30.840
Like it's a really interesting infrastructure

19:30.840 --> 19:31.680
that they're doing.

19:31.680 --> 19:35.160
The only problem in the OpenSUSE case

19:35.160 --> 19:38.160
is that Leap doesn't have very long support.

19:38.160 --> 19:41.060
Like I think it's a total of 18 months,

19:41.060 --> 19:45.100
which it sounds good, but it means that once a new version

19:45.100 --> 19:47.740
of release, you only have six months to update.

19:47.740 --> 19:50.980
So that's kind of like lackluster,

19:50.980 --> 19:53.420
but overall it's still better than,

19:53.420 --> 19:55.080
you know, it's not five years,

19:55.080 --> 19:57.460
but at least it's almost two years, so.

19:57.460 --> 20:00.820
Would the argument that you could try on the desktop

20:00.820 --> 20:02.860
and run on the server not also stand true

20:02.860 --> 20:05.500
for Fedora workstation and Fedora server,

20:05.500 --> 20:07.380
and Ubuntu desktop and Ubuntu?

20:07.380 --> 20:08.740
If you're using Fedora, yes.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.900
More, Ubuntu's more in line,

20:11.900 --> 20:14.480
because like the server packages

20:14.480 --> 20:16.500
and the desktop packages for Ubuntu

20:16.500 --> 20:18.300
are essentially in the same repo

20:18.300 --> 20:20.300
and the same compatibility structure,

20:20.300 --> 20:22.860
whereas Fedora, they split stuff off

20:22.860 --> 20:26.740
so that if you're gonna use Fedora server, great,

20:26.740 --> 20:29.820
but if you're gonna use CentOS or Red Hat, not really.

20:29.820 --> 20:31.520
Yeah, yeah, there's definitely a difference.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.140
You know, when we were doing our review

20:34.140 --> 20:35.340
or our How to Pick a Distro,

20:35.340 --> 20:38.060
which is the last episode of Linux Action Show,

20:38.060 --> 20:39.780
Chris and I did, and you know,

20:39.780 --> 20:42.340
I think really that was one of my favorite episodes

20:42.340 --> 20:43.800
I think that we've ever done.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.940
I think that, because both Chris and I come at it

20:46.940 --> 20:49.380
from very different perspectives,

20:49.380 --> 20:52.420
and it was interesting that we both kind of gravitated

20:52.420 --> 20:54.740
and arrived at kind of the same conclusions,

20:54.740 --> 20:57.240
which kind of gives me a big head,

20:57.240 --> 20:59.860
and I say to myself, well, clearly,

20:59.860 --> 21:01.780
I think we're doing something right.

21:01.780 --> 21:02.940
I think we've landed on the right way

21:02.940 --> 21:06.320
because somebody that I very much respect, his opinion,

21:06.320 --> 21:08.440
has arrived at the same conclusion.

21:08.440 --> 21:09.980
And one thing we didn't really get to

21:09.980 --> 21:14.620
was I had divided that post out.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.980
He basically asked, how do you choose a distro?

21:16.980 --> 21:19.380
And I said, well, basically, I would divide that out,

21:19.380 --> 21:21.300
desktop users, server users, power users,

21:21.300 --> 21:23.620
development users, and specialty distro users,

21:23.620 --> 21:26.440
and we focused then on desktop distributions

21:26.440 --> 21:28.300
because that's what the original post was asking.

21:28.300 --> 21:32.780
But you know, I think server, picking a server distro

21:32.780 --> 21:34.580
has an equal amount of questions,

21:34.580 --> 21:36.180
and I think the conversation that Michael and I

21:36.180 --> 21:38.860
are having right now really exemplify that.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.860
I think there's a lot of good reasons to choose RHEL.

21:40.860 --> 21:43.060
I think there's a lot of good reasons to choose CentOS.

21:43.060 --> 21:46.260
I think there's a lot of good reasons to choose SUS.

21:46.260 --> 21:50.100
And one of the arguments that I have made to every client,

21:50.100 --> 21:53.700
and you know, basically, if you ever watch,

21:53.700 --> 21:55.700
if you ever know somebody that's in the military,

21:55.700 --> 21:59.860
and they were assigned a specific weapon system,

21:59.860 --> 22:02.780
a lot of those guys will go buy similar weapon systems

22:02.780 --> 22:04.840
when they get home to shoot

22:04.840 --> 22:06.040
because they're very comfortable on it,

22:06.040 --> 22:07.700
they were trained on it, and they're very accurate with it,

22:07.700 --> 22:09.260
and this, that, and so forth.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.100
And I've had conversations with them,

22:11.100 --> 22:13.340
and I would say, why would you use that particular rifle

22:13.340 --> 22:14.340
in this particular scenario?

22:14.340 --> 22:16.020
It doesn't seem like it really fits very well.

22:16.020 --> 22:17.680
And they say, well, I'm very comfortable with it.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.100
And that actually kind of rings true

22:20.100 --> 22:22.780
because I started on Red Hat,

22:22.780 --> 22:24.460
and so I'm just very comfortable with Red Hat.

22:24.460 --> 22:27.040
And so when I go in, anytime I set up a server,

22:27.040 --> 22:28.180
it's just Red Hat.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.900
And one of the things that works so well for me

22:31.900 --> 22:34.020
is being able to go into a client and saying,

22:34.020 --> 22:35.440
hey, listen, I tell you what,

22:35.440 --> 22:37.300
this is a project that you want to do,

22:37.300 --> 22:38.140
and so I'll give you an example.

22:38.140 --> 22:39.940
We were working with the University of North Dakota,

22:39.940 --> 22:42.180
and they wanted to do this chemical calculation server.

22:42.180 --> 22:43.300
So basically, the way it would work

22:43.300 --> 22:48.300
is the students would submit these chemical values,

22:48.620 --> 22:51.020
and the server would do all of the crunching.

22:51.020 --> 22:53.700
Now, they bought like this $28,000.

22:53.700 --> 22:56.140
I mean, it was crazy, just crazy.

22:56.140 --> 22:58.660
Custom build, everything was just amazing.

22:58.660 --> 22:59.900
And they were trying to decide

22:59.900 --> 23:01.020
if they were gonna contract with us

23:01.020 --> 23:02.520
to set this particular server up.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.500
And I said, well, listen, we have a lot of experience,

23:04.500 --> 23:05.580
probably more than anyone else

23:05.580 --> 23:07.780
in the Grand Forks surrounding area,

23:07.780 --> 23:09.580
in setting up Linux and working with Linux,

23:09.580 --> 23:12.940
and I will tell you that not only is this possible,

23:12.940 --> 23:17.140
but we can make this amazing for your students.

23:17.140 --> 23:22.100
We can put it on a public network and give it a public IP,

23:22.100 --> 23:24.060
and your students will be able to access this box from home

23:24.060 --> 23:26.340
and submit their chemical calculations from home

23:26.340 --> 23:27.300
and submit them from anywhere.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.420
And they said, we don't know about that.

23:29.420 --> 23:30.380
Is it secure enough?

23:30.380 --> 23:31.220
Is it really gonna work?

23:31.220 --> 23:33.340
And I said, all right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

23:33.340 --> 23:35.620
I will give you, for the first month,

23:35.620 --> 23:37.580
I will give you a server to use.

23:37.580 --> 23:40.300
And they said, you have a $28,000 server?

23:40.300 --> 23:41.180
And I said, well, not exactly,

23:41.180 --> 23:43.180
but I tell you what I do have.

23:43.180 --> 23:46.620
I have access to some really powerful machines,

23:46.620 --> 23:49.460
and I will give you access to one for free for a month,

23:49.460 --> 23:51.780
and you try it, and if it works, then you call me back,

23:51.780 --> 23:54.880
and I will come set your server up the exact same way.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.580
And they said, oh, okay, that's great.

23:56.580 --> 23:57.940
When can we get that rolling?

23:57.940 --> 23:58.820
Next week, next month?

23:58.820 --> 24:00.140
And I said, no, right now.

24:00.140 --> 24:01.460
I'm gonna do it right now for you.

24:01.460 --> 24:02.940
So I opened my laptop up,

24:02.940 --> 24:06.500
and I went over to digitalocean.com,

24:06.500 --> 24:09.300
and I used the code for DO Unplugged.

24:10.380 --> 24:12.340
And they gave me $10 credit.

24:12.340 --> 24:15.140
Now, I had to buy a pretty beefy rig

24:15.140 --> 24:17.940
because of the sheer amount of bandwidth

24:17.940 --> 24:18.780
that we were gonna use,

24:18.780 --> 24:21.080
and the sheer amount of CPU power that we needed to use

24:21.080 --> 24:22.500
was gonna be incredible.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.180
So I bought a pretty beefy rig.

24:25.180 --> 24:26.420
It didn't really save me a whole lot,

24:26.420 --> 24:29.420
but if you're doing something like a Plex server,

24:29.420 --> 24:31.620
or if you're doing something like a simple FTP server,

24:31.620 --> 24:34.100
or a web server, or maybe you wanna host your own blog.

24:34.100 --> 24:35.800
Or you're connecting to our IRC room,

24:35.800 --> 24:36.640
and you're using Quasl,

24:36.640 --> 24:37.980
you wanna have a Quasl core up there,

24:37.980 --> 24:38.940
it's perfect for that.

24:38.940 --> 24:41.260
Exactly, as long as you're not using it for production

24:41.260 --> 24:42.420
so it doesn't crash,

24:42.420 --> 24:45.300
you, at Quasl, not Digitalocean,

24:45.300 --> 24:48.160
you would get two months out of that

24:48.160 --> 24:49.580
because you can do it on a $5 rig.

24:49.580 --> 24:52.300
And if, I'll tell you what, let's do this.

24:52.300 --> 24:55.160
Let's sign into my account right now,

24:55.160 --> 24:57.740
and let's see how many rigs I have

24:57.740 --> 24:59.840
and which ones they are.

24:59.840 --> 25:04.840
I would say the majority of my rigs are $5 ones.

25:07.720 --> 25:08.920
And the reason I say that is

25:08.920 --> 25:13.240
because most of the things I do are pretty simplistic.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.080
So let's see here.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.120
Now this is my personal account.

25:15.120 --> 25:18.340
This is not our company, my AltaSpeed account.

25:20.400 --> 25:21.280
So let's see here.

25:21.280 --> 25:22.120
Yeah, we can tell.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.480
So any of these that say 512,

25:24.480 --> 25:26.880
so that's a $5 server, that's a $5 server,

25:26.880 --> 25:29.560
that's a $5 server, that's a $20 one,

25:29.560 --> 25:32.840
that's a $5 server, that's a $20 one,

25:32.840 --> 25:35.020
that's a $20 one.

25:35.020 --> 25:37.640
The amount of work I'm able to get done

25:37.640 --> 25:40.480
with just a $5 rig is incredible.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.480
So head over to digitalocean.com,

25:42.480 --> 25:46.760
use the code word DOUNPLUGGED and get yourself $10 off.

25:46.760 --> 25:51.000
You have no idea the world that you are entering into

25:51.000 --> 25:52.400
with hosted VPSs.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.000
You've not played with VPSs.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.400
You are missing out on like a whole spectrum of Linux.

25:58.400 --> 25:59.760
You think you like distro hopping

25:59.760 --> 26:01.480
and you think it's fun to do it on your desktop,

26:01.480 --> 26:04.600
just wait until you can do that with a click of a button.

26:04.600 --> 26:07.760
And if you use the Yubi keys,

26:07.760 --> 26:10.920
then that's really where the rubber meets the road.

26:10.920 --> 26:15.660
Let me tell you because I literally click on Noah's SSH key

26:15.660 --> 26:19.520
and then all I have to do is type in the SSH command

26:19.520 --> 26:21.840
in my laptop and it prompts me for a pin.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.740
I enter a four digit pin, no emailing me the password,

26:24.740 --> 26:28.000
which you know they CC the NSA on that stuff too, right?

26:28.000 --> 26:32.480
Like anytime a password goes over the internet,

26:32.480 --> 26:34.560
like basically the NSA is grabbing that.

26:34.560 --> 26:37.060
That's terrible, it's terrible.

26:37.060 --> 26:39.960
So use the Yubi key, way better.

26:41.120 --> 26:44.680
I want to talk about something that I came across

26:44.680 --> 26:47.560
that just made me sit back and go, huh.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.840
I, as I said earlier in the show,

26:50.840 --> 26:52.920
I recently switched to Arch.

26:52.920 --> 26:57.920
So you can imagine my reaction when I saw

26:58.360 --> 27:02.160
that RaspArch is going to be a thing.

27:02.160 --> 27:07.160
Arch Linux on the Raspberry Pi 3 and it ships with York,

27:07.440 --> 27:08.560
which is an important distinction.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.960
I'll get to that in a minute.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.120
That's our thing.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.800
If I have a Raspberry Pi,

27:14.800 --> 27:18.480
usually I am putting a Raspberry on it, right?

27:18.480 --> 27:19.360
That's just kind of what you,

27:19.360 --> 27:21.320
that's kind of like the go-to of the noobs installer

27:21.320 --> 27:24.040
or whatever, as an Arch user,

27:24.040 --> 27:27.120
being able to choose one distribution

27:27.120 --> 27:28.440
and run it on everything,

27:28.440 --> 27:30.200
now that has been extended,

27:30.200 --> 27:33.500
not only just from my servers to my laptops,

27:33.500 --> 27:37.360
now we can go on a Raspberry freaking Pi.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.160
Michael, were you going to say something?

27:39.160 --> 27:43.840
Yeah, alarm is Arch Linux arm, it already exists.

27:43.840 --> 27:48.120
Oh, but was there a Pi image?

27:48.120 --> 27:48.960
Was there? Yeah.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.600
Was it easy? There's been a Pi image

27:51.600 --> 27:54.080
since the Raspberry Pi had been.

27:54.080 --> 27:56.960
Are you telling me that Arch for the Pi has existed

27:56.960 --> 27:58.560
and I didn't know about it?

27:58.560 --> 27:59.400
Yes.

27:59.400 --> 28:00.640
Well, that's embarrassing.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.720
Technically though, it's a separate distro.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.560
It's not actually made by the Arch Linux group,

28:04.560 --> 28:06.640
but it's the Arch Linux,

28:06.640 --> 28:10.920
Arch Linux has an agreement with the Arch Linux arm project

28:10.920 --> 28:12.020
so that it to use the name.

28:12.020 --> 28:13.360
So they are in conjunction,

28:13.360 --> 28:14.760
but they're not officially,

28:14.760 --> 28:16.800
like Arch Linux is not powering it.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.320
So it's more like-

28:18.320 --> 28:20.000
Let me ask you this.

28:20.000 --> 28:20.840
Let me ask you this.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.720
Did it come with Yortonstone or Packer?

28:23.720 --> 28:24.540
Any of those?

28:24.540 --> 28:25.380
No.

28:25.380 --> 28:28.440
No, it comes with the ability to do those, yes.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.360
Yeah, right, right, right.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.180
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

28:30.180 --> 28:32.680
So when I first started using Arch,

28:32.680 --> 28:35.760
one of my biggest mistakes was I wasn't aware

28:35.760 --> 28:37.440
of some of the package managers that were out there.

28:37.440 --> 28:40.040
So I was downloading these files and extracting the thing

28:40.040 --> 28:42.360
and doing the make and all that stuff, right?

28:42.360 --> 28:46.300
And after use, one of the things I appreciate

28:46.300 --> 28:48.440
about Antragos and one of the reasons I use Antragos

28:48.440 --> 28:52.680
instead of Arch proper is because it handles some

28:52.680 --> 28:53.760
of that stuff for me.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.160
It comes with Yortonstone.

28:55.160 --> 28:56.800
I don't really like Yort, to be honest,

28:56.800 --> 28:58.120
to ask me too many questions,

28:58.120 --> 29:01.000
but I can simply open a terminal type,

29:01.000 --> 29:04.840
yort-tac-s-packer-enter.

29:04.840 --> 29:07.280
And then once I hit yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no,

29:07.280 --> 29:10.040
yes, yes, no, no, yes, no, yes, no, no, yes, yes, no, no.

29:10.040 --> 29:10.860
It's ridiculous.

29:10.860 --> 29:11.760
And they have to bounce between,

29:11.760 --> 29:13.600
like I wish I could do all of the edits first

29:13.600 --> 29:15.600
and then do you want to continue last

29:15.600 --> 29:17.480
so I could like get into the habit of pressing no

29:17.480 --> 29:20.120
a certain amount of times and yes, they don't do that.

29:20.120 --> 29:21.640
Once I get Packer installed,

29:21.640 --> 29:26.440
then I can just move on and Yort makes it very easy

29:26.440 --> 29:27.280
to do that.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.040
I think that all Arch systems,

29:30.040 --> 29:32.720
if you're not actually doing Arch from like scratch,

29:32.720 --> 29:34.940
like the way that you're supposed to do Arch,

29:34.940 --> 29:37.880
I think it should include a package manager of some sort.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.240
And particularly on the Raspberry Pi

29:40.240 --> 29:42.080
where it takes a long time to compile stuff,

29:42.080 --> 29:46.160
I feel like that's a big, big, big advantage

29:46.160 --> 29:48.760
to have just a built-in package manager.

29:48.760 --> 29:49.680
What do you think?

29:49.680 --> 29:50.640
I just checked,

29:51.720 --> 29:56.160
Yort is not available on Arch Linux arm or alarm,

29:56.160 --> 29:58.200
but Packer is.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.600
Oh.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.800
Packers in the official repos?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.040
Yep.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.480
Nice.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.480
And being completely honest with you,

30:05.480 --> 30:07.080
I'd actually, I would only use,

30:07.080 --> 30:10.600
Yort to me is only useful to get Packer on there.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.720
Packer is really what I want to use.

30:12.720 --> 30:13.560
Now let me-

30:13.560 --> 30:14.720
I just skipped a step.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.640
Let me draw a contrast because I have a feeling

30:16.640 --> 30:17.800
you're going to be on the other side of this,

30:17.800 --> 30:19.320
and I think that's a good thing.

30:20.680 --> 30:25.120
Seuss has also announced that they have images available

30:25.120 --> 30:30.120
for the Raspberry Pi, specifically Seuss Leap.

30:30.920 --> 30:34.440
And when I first saw this, I guess I was honestly,

30:34.440 --> 30:37.240
if I'm being, you know, if I'm being frank,

30:37.240 --> 30:38.440
I was a little confused.

30:38.440 --> 30:41.360
You know, part of it is the, you know,

30:41.360 --> 30:44.680
the article goes on just, it goes in here and it says that

30:44.680 --> 30:47.080
having a stable code base for leap images,

30:47.080 --> 30:49.720
which provides fewer updates than the tumbleweed

30:49.720 --> 30:51.840
for the Raspberry Pi 3 gives people stability

30:51.840 --> 30:54.200
and expands opportunities for those

30:54.200 --> 30:56.040
who are wanting to use the Raspberry Pi

30:56.040 --> 30:57.800
for home automation.

30:57.800 --> 31:02.800
I am wondering how many people are concerned about stability

31:03.720 --> 31:05.800
from a $35 computer.

31:05.800 --> 31:09.560
Am I missing something?

31:09.560 --> 31:10.400
Yeah.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.440
I mean, I guess, I don't know.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.560
I would use Debian if I was caring about stability.

31:14.560 --> 31:15.440
Right.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.760
Well, so that's the, I mean,

31:17.760 --> 31:20.200
so that's a conversation all in itself, right?

31:20.200 --> 31:23.600
We're using Leap, but I just,

31:23.600 --> 31:28.360
I understand the argument for using Seuss on the server.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.800
It wouldn't be necessarily what I would choose to do.

31:30.800 --> 31:34.920
I don't necessarily think it has enough advantages

31:34.920 --> 31:37.360
to pull me off of Red Hat,

31:37.360 --> 31:40.240
but I could definitely see it if Seuss was already in place

31:40.240 --> 31:42.240
or if you're a business starting up and there's,

31:42.240 --> 31:43.160
you know, you have somebody,

31:43.160 --> 31:44.520
you know, you hired assistant administrator,

31:44.520 --> 31:46.120
maybe he knows Seuss very well,

31:46.120 --> 31:51.040
or maybe Seuss happens to be the predominant server platform

31:51.040 --> 31:52.920
that a lot of your competitors are using.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.920
And so a lot of the industry software is written

31:54.920 --> 31:55.840
and works very well.

31:55.840 --> 31:58.440
And, you know, there's a number of arguments

31:58.440 --> 32:02.360
where I can make to see how Seuss works in the enterprise.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.600
I am really not getting it.

32:04.600 --> 32:08.040
Why somebody would want to run Seuss on a,

32:08.040 --> 32:10.040
like what the compelling reason to run Seuss on a Pi

32:10.040 --> 32:11.680
other than, well, because we can,

32:11.680 --> 32:13.840
which is a perfectly valid reason.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.800
I think you answered it earlier when you were talking about,

32:15.800 --> 32:19.520
you know, that analogy of people leaving the military.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.400
There are people who like to use, you know,

32:21.400 --> 32:22.800
Seuss in production.

32:22.800 --> 32:24.640
And so, you know, if you're also starting to do things

32:24.640 --> 32:26.960
like using in Pis to automate around your office

32:26.960 --> 32:28.640
or in your home, you know,

32:28.640 --> 32:30.120
that's probably what they're most comfortable with.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.000
And then now you have an option.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.840
I think it's also just nice in the,

32:33.840 --> 32:36.960
just the aspect of the Arm, I don't know for you,

32:36.960 --> 32:39.560
but the Arm world still sometimes a little weird for me,

32:39.560 --> 32:40.880
or, you know, it has different paradigms.

32:40.880 --> 32:41.840
There's different things available.

32:41.840 --> 32:45.960
So the more sort of parity between like the X86 world

32:45.960 --> 32:47.960
and the Arm world where, you know,

32:47.960 --> 32:50.200
I have the tools and distributions I like here.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.960
And I kind of expect, even if that's a wrong expectation,

32:52.960 --> 32:54.640
I expect to be able to use them in the Arm world

32:54.640 --> 32:55.640
and the Pi world.

32:55.640 --> 32:59.080
And so this kind of just goes a little way towards that.

32:59.080 --> 33:04.080
Hurricane Hernandez, am I pronouncing that right?

33:04.800 --> 33:05.720
Yeah, you got it.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.640
Okay, so as you guys know,

33:08.640 --> 33:11.000
I'm one of the main packagers for Envy.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.720
And when I became a developer,

33:14.320 --> 33:16.000
I mean, I started distro hopping

33:16.000 --> 33:17.400
and somehow ended up on Seuss

33:17.400 --> 33:19.200
because I just couldn't get packages

33:19.200 --> 33:22.320
that were up to date on Debian or Ubuntu.

33:22.320 --> 33:24.360
Now, when you bring Seuss and Arm,

33:24.360 --> 33:29.360
I think Seuss becomes even more relevant because of OBS.

33:29.960 --> 33:33.600
The power that OBS gives you is to compile the packages

33:33.600 --> 33:37.080
and anything you're working on their system,

33:37.080 --> 33:39.520
which means you're not bogging down your Pi.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.000
Now I understand Arch and I understand Packer.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.080
And if I'm correct, yeah, I mean,

33:44.080 --> 33:45.520
the AUR most of the time,

33:45.520 --> 33:48.480
you're compiling those packages on that Pi.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.600
So that's gonna be taking a hit on your system.

33:50.600 --> 33:51.680
That might take days.

33:51.680 --> 33:52.520
Right, right.

33:52.520 --> 33:55.440
So I think that's when Seuss now becomes even more relevant

33:55.440 --> 33:57.400
is if you're using a low power system

33:57.400 --> 34:01.400
and OBS is there and available for free to every user.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.200
That's slick.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.040
I like it.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.160
That's a good point.

34:05.160 --> 34:06.000
I guess I can see that.

34:06.000 --> 34:06.840
I guess I can see that

34:06.840 --> 34:09.160
from both a comfortability standpoint

34:09.160 --> 34:12.960
and just a drop in desktop,

34:12.960 --> 34:16.120
like everything is just ready to go for you.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.360
So essentially I go to work and I work on Seuss servers

34:19.360 --> 34:21.120
and then I sit down at my Seuss desktop

34:21.120 --> 34:22.920
that's provided me from me by work.

34:22.920 --> 34:25.880
And so when I get home, I can use that same operating system.

34:25.880 --> 34:26.720
I guess that makes sense.

34:26.720 --> 34:29.080
You can also build and do custom builds on OBS.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.320
So you can have a company specific stuff

34:33.320 --> 34:35.320
being built for you or something like that.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.120
Let me twist it a little bit.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.120
So I guess all of those arguments make sense

34:42.120 --> 34:43.720
from a desktop standpoint.

34:43.720 --> 34:46.040
Do we think that those arguments stand true

34:46.040 --> 34:49.120
if we're talking about like a home server?

34:49.120 --> 34:53.320
Is it still important to have all of that familiar?

34:53.320 --> 34:55.160
Because I mean, you have to think about it.

34:55.160 --> 34:59.480
The Raspberry Pi world is kind of its own bubble

34:59.480 --> 35:00.880
inside of the Linux ecosystem.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.960
And so a lot of people that are making something

35:03.960 --> 35:05.320
that works on the Pi,

35:05.320 --> 35:08.040
they typically you would use the distribution

35:08.040 --> 35:08.880
that they're using, right?

35:08.880 --> 35:10.880
And you're probably not gonna run more than one service

35:10.880 --> 35:12.120
on a Raspberry Pi,

35:12.120 --> 35:14.120
and one service is right taxing it to be honest.

35:14.120 --> 35:16.120
So if you're using a whatever,

35:16.120 --> 35:18.200
a home automation controller,

35:18.200 --> 35:20.320
would you not be using whatever distro

35:20.320 --> 35:22.520
the home automation controller people are using

35:22.520 --> 35:24.520
so that you kind of stay in sync with them?

35:25.520 --> 35:26.440
Am I off?

35:26.440 --> 35:28.280
I mean, you may want to.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.080
If you're using an appliance, yes.

35:30.080 --> 35:33.080
But I think there's also, that does happen.

35:33.080 --> 35:34.920
And I think you see those in wider distributions,

35:34.920 --> 35:36.760
but it seems like, at least to me,

35:36.760 --> 35:39.720
that the majority of people who pick up one or two Pis,

35:39.720 --> 35:41.080
they're just playing with a couple of things.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.120
They want custom projects.

35:42.120 --> 35:45.520
Maybe you're writing a little homebrewed script

35:45.520 --> 35:47.320
to run something that prints out

35:47.320 --> 35:48.840
or sends you messages or whatever.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.200
And in that case, you might just want whatever distribution

35:51.200 --> 35:53.800
is easiest for you to run that code on.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.800
And also people say stuff about how the Pi is not as,

35:56.800 --> 35:57.880
like you only can do one thing.

35:57.880 --> 35:58.720
That's not true.

35:58.720 --> 36:01.000
I mean, you can have a sync service activated

36:01.000 --> 36:03.640
and you can have a full desktop with like Raspbian

36:03.640 --> 36:04.960
and you can have a bunch of other stuff working.

36:04.960 --> 36:06.200
I mean, I have a Pi doing that

36:06.200 --> 36:07.400
and it's not even the newest one.

36:07.400 --> 36:11.480
It's like the model B before the B plus came out.

36:11.480 --> 36:12.800
So years ago. Nice.

36:12.800 --> 36:17.800
So, you know, I have a problem with the Raspberry Pi.

36:18.120 --> 36:19.680
I'm not really with the Raspberry Pi,

36:19.680 --> 36:22.800
but what I call the misuse of Raspberry Pis.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.280
You know, I think the Raspberry Pi

36:24.280 --> 36:26.520
is a great educational tool.

36:26.520 --> 36:30.400
And I think it definitely has some production value.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.400
And I'll give you an example.

36:32.400 --> 36:36.000
We have a client that has a PBX phone system

36:36.000 --> 36:38.440
and there is an RS232 serial output

36:38.440 --> 36:43.440
that basically dumps every console thing that occurs.

36:44.240 --> 36:47.000
So every time somebody places a call or receives a call

36:47.000 --> 36:49.920
that call gets spit out to RS232.

36:49.920 --> 36:53.160
Well, basically the client wanted to log

36:53.160 --> 36:55.080
all of that information.

36:55.080 --> 36:58.240
And so attaching a Pi and, you know,

36:58.240 --> 36:59.200
pulling that serial output

36:59.200 --> 37:01.320
and just dumping it into a text file was trivial.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.600
In those kinds of circumstances,

37:02.600 --> 37:03.920
I think it works really, really great.

37:03.920 --> 37:07.000
But I have some reservations.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.880
A while back at the Linux Action Show

37:10.560 --> 37:12.320
was featured a Raspberry Pi

37:12.320 --> 37:14.440
that was being used in a medical device, right?

37:14.440 --> 37:17.680
And I think that we have begun to stretch the limits

37:17.680 --> 37:20.120
of what the Raspberry Pi was intended for

37:20.120 --> 37:22.000
and what it is capable of.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.120
And that is an opinion that formed

37:25.120 --> 37:28.480
after having a very deep discussion with Jason,

37:29.320 --> 37:32.080
who is one of the, he's an ArchArm guy.

37:32.080 --> 37:36.040
And he just, he lives, eats and breathes ARM architecture,

37:36.040 --> 37:36.880
loves it to death.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.680
And can tell you anything you want to know

37:38.680 --> 37:40.880
about every device ever made that is ARM.

37:40.880 --> 37:43.040
Guy knows more about ARM devices that people will make.

37:43.040 --> 37:44.200
I mean, he's incredible.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.960
And he was showing me some of the different ARM devices

37:48.960 --> 37:50.720
that are designed for commercial applications

37:50.720 --> 37:52.840
that are designed to be used as embedded servers

37:52.840 --> 37:54.800
and this, that and the other.

37:54.800 --> 37:57.800
And I have noticed, even on a small scale,

37:57.800 --> 37:59.760
that if you have a Raspberry Pi,

37:59.760 --> 38:01.680
it doesn't seem to run for more than a year or so

38:01.680 --> 38:03.360
without running into some sort of problems.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.520
And I'm wondering, you know, Michael specifically,

38:05.520 --> 38:06.920
have you experienced that?

38:09.200 --> 38:11.640
No, not really, no.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.160
So how long has yours been in production?

38:13.160 --> 38:14.720
How long have you been using it?

38:15.720 --> 38:18.600
Off and on, but I don't have them all the time

38:18.600 --> 38:19.600
because I don't use it.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.160
Like the syncing is all the time.

38:21.160 --> 38:22.880
I've only been doing that for about six months.

38:22.880 --> 38:24.760
But I've been using the same Pi's.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.000
I've had two Pi's and they're both the same version

38:27.000 --> 38:28.280
and they're both very old.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.840
And I've been using them without any kind of problems at all.

38:30.840 --> 38:32.000
But you've reinstalled.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.480
On one of them, yes.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.640
The other one is still, one of them runs Kodi

38:36.640 --> 38:38.600
and I haven't reinstalled that one.

38:38.600 --> 38:40.360
Oh, that's interesting.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.920
Well, maybe it's time for Noah to update his opinion.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.640
I think maybe, Noah, where you were coming from is,

38:45.640 --> 38:46.880
you know, it's like you can't really do something

38:46.880 --> 38:47.720
where you need throughput.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.160
It doesn't make a good file server.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.960
You wouldn't edit video on it,

38:50.960 --> 38:53.320
but there may be some things where you really just need

38:53.320 --> 38:55.840
the lowest common denominator of Unix system.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.920
I mean, I tried what I thought was a pretty simple thing,

38:58.920 --> 39:01.400
which was I wanted it to run a Quasso server.

39:01.400 --> 39:02.720
Didn't handle that very well.

39:02.720 --> 39:06.480
Then I tried it just as, if anyone's familiar with OpenEMR,

39:06.480 --> 39:09.200
it's not anything, it's not terribly complicated.

39:09.200 --> 39:12.040
It's basically a web server with a database backend.

39:12.040 --> 39:14.400
And it wasn't like it was in production or anything

39:14.400 --> 39:15.220
with a lot of users.

39:15.220 --> 39:16.780
It was just me, me and my wife.

39:16.780 --> 39:19.440
We were both trying and she does billing

39:19.440 --> 39:22.080
for some of the clinics that I do IT support for.

39:22.960 --> 39:26.800
And we tried it between us and it couldn't handle that.

39:26.800 --> 39:27.640
It would crash.

39:27.640 --> 39:29.360
I'd get a year out of it,

39:29.360 --> 39:31.400
but a little bit after that it would crash.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.040
And so it just kind of turned me off from the pies.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.880
And I was actually voicing that frustration to Jason.

39:34.880 --> 39:35.840
And then that's kind of where

39:35.840 --> 39:37.440
that whole conversation transpired.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.600
But you guys are giving me a new hope.

39:39.600 --> 39:41.960
And I'll tell you kind of what that hope is.

39:41.960 --> 39:45.080
It's that the small arm devices,

39:45.080 --> 39:48.840
you can combine them with other little pieces of hardware

39:48.840 --> 39:50.720
and produce very, very cool things.

39:50.720 --> 39:54.400
So you were talking about a USB serial port.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.360
One of the things I've always thought about doing

39:56.360 --> 39:58.360
is taking one of those raspberry pies

39:58.360 --> 40:02.640
and combining it with one of those like USB GSM modems,

40:02.640 --> 40:07.040
and then heading over to linux.ting.com.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.120
I can't get over that URL.

40:08.120 --> 40:10.620
It's such a great URL, linux.ting.com,

40:10.620 --> 40:12.600
where they'll give me basically

40:12.600 --> 40:14.440
three months of service for free

40:14.440 --> 40:17.260
because they're gonna give you 25 bucks.

40:17.260 --> 40:22.140
And I have so many Ting devices.

40:22.140 --> 40:23.700
I would load it on here for you,

40:23.700 --> 40:25.240
but they wouldn't all fit on the screen.

40:25.240 --> 40:27.000
That's how many Ting devices I have.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.560
I've got my mother on Ting, I'm on Ting,

40:29.560 --> 40:31.320
my wife's on Ting, got my dad on Ting.

40:31.320 --> 40:33.040
And then I have all of these other things.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.760
I call them auxiliary devices, right?

40:34.760 --> 40:36.920
Like my laptop has a GSM card in it.

40:36.920 --> 40:38.900
I would love to put a GSM card

40:38.900 --> 40:40.320
in one of those little USB modems

40:40.320 --> 40:44.060
and have a full functioning like all-in-one

40:44.060 --> 40:47.520
or desktop computer that has its own connection

40:47.520 --> 40:48.480
to the internet.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.520
Man, would that be nice to have inside of the shop

40:50.520 --> 40:52.240
or even here in the studio.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.560
If I needed to check on something,

40:53.560 --> 40:55.360
I wanted to check to see if the stream was up.

40:55.360 --> 40:58.040
Somebody reports an issue says, we can't get the stream.

40:58.040 --> 41:00.040
Sure be nice to have a secondary internet connection

41:00.040 --> 41:01.200
just to check that.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.920
And the thing about Ting is,

41:02.920 --> 41:04.920
they only charge you for what you use.

41:04.920 --> 41:09.440
So if I, I'm not gonna make any calls off my Raspberry Pi,

41:09.440 --> 41:12.280
I'm not gonna use any voice minutes, so I pay zero.

41:12.280 --> 41:14.560
I'm not gonna send any text messages.

41:14.560 --> 41:18.520
The idea that people still send SMS in 2016 is ridiculous.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.480
Exactly.

41:19.480 --> 41:20.800
No stickers.

41:20.800 --> 41:23.440
If you have MMS, which is really kind of a,

41:23.440 --> 41:24.760
screwed up version of SMS,

41:24.760 --> 41:27.200
then you could use, you could send pictures.

41:27.200 --> 41:30.600
There's a stupid character limit, 140 characters.

41:30.600 --> 41:31.560
Have you guys heard me?

41:31.560 --> 41:33.040
It's like sending a telegram

41:33.040 --> 41:34.840
and not the good kind of telegram.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.200
Have you heard me on any show?

41:36.200 --> 41:38.440
Do you think I could express any thought at all

41:38.440 --> 41:40.160
in 140 characters or less?

41:40.160 --> 41:41.000
It is ridiculous.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.560
Anyone who knows me knows I'd blab on for hours.

41:43.560 --> 41:45.560
This episode of Linux Unplugged that you're hearing,

41:45.560 --> 41:47.880
it probably took Rikai seven hours to cut out

41:47.880 --> 41:50.280
all of the inconsistent babble

41:50.280 --> 41:55.200
that occurred throughout the usable bits.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.120
I can't say anything.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.880
And so the fact that people still send text messages

41:57.880 --> 41:58.720
is ridiculous.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.400
Move on to something like Telegram or Viber,

42:00.400 --> 42:02.720
whatever you use, but don't use text messages.

42:02.720 --> 42:03.800
So that's gonna be zero.

42:03.800 --> 42:07.140
The only thing I'm gonna pay for is the data I use.

42:07.140 --> 42:11.680
And Ting's data rates, they started out crazy good,

42:11.680 --> 42:13.040
and now they've gotten even better.

42:13.040 --> 42:15.000
Do you have somebody, one of your friends,

42:15.000 --> 42:17.280
are they bragging about their Google Fi?

42:17.280 --> 42:20.520
Well, now Ting has as good, if not better, pricing.

42:20.520 --> 42:23.120
And let me tell you something,

42:23.120 --> 42:26.820
you don't have to buy some super special $600 phone

42:26.820 --> 42:28.700
to use on Ting.

42:28.700 --> 42:30.780
You can buy any unlocked GSM device.

42:30.780 --> 42:34.000
Me personally, I bought my last device from Best Buy.

42:34.000 --> 42:34.920
I walked into Best Buy,

42:34.920 --> 42:37.060
I went over to their unlocked phone section,

42:37.060 --> 42:39.840
I picked out a phone, I walked up to the register,

42:39.840 --> 42:41.360
and I paid for my phone and I walked out,

42:41.360 --> 42:42.680
and I had an activated phone.

42:42.680 --> 42:44.640
In fact, the guy at Best Buy actually put my Ting SIM

42:44.640 --> 42:46.220
into it, and then we had a discussion

42:46.220 --> 42:47.160
about how great Ting was.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.760
It was kind of cool.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.640
You can buy unlocked phones on Amazon,

42:50.640 --> 42:53.520
you can buy phones on Ting's site.

42:53.520 --> 42:54.520
Right before Chris took off,

42:54.520 --> 42:57.080
he was talking about how great it would be

42:57.080 --> 42:59.160
to buy a phone for your loved one

42:59.160 --> 43:00.960
or even for yourself for Christmas.

43:00.960 --> 43:02.160
Now, I'll tell you something, here's a little,

43:02.160 --> 43:02.980
here's a pro tip.

43:02.980 --> 43:05.320
See this, where it says $9 for the SIM?

43:05.320 --> 43:07.920
That's not what you pay for a SIM.

43:07.920 --> 43:12.080
If you wait, Ting runs dollar SIM specials.

43:12.080 --> 43:15.120
Dollar SIMs, you can get a SIM for a dollar.

43:15.120 --> 43:18.760
So, I ordered 20 of them because why not?

43:18.760 --> 43:19.940
And now I hand them out to people.

43:19.940 --> 43:21.160
And I actually mailed one.

43:21.160 --> 43:23.520
Yeah, and I actually, I handed one out to a viewer.

43:23.520 --> 43:27.240
So, linux.ting.com, the coolest URL ever.

43:27.240 --> 43:31.080
And save $25 off your first device or your first,

43:32.440 --> 43:34.440
I'm gonna say if you're using it as a test phone

43:34.440 --> 43:35.880
or if you're using it as an auxiliary device,

43:35.880 --> 43:38.520
you'll get three months out of that, 25 bucks.

43:38.520 --> 43:42.040
And because it's only $6 per line.

43:42.040 --> 43:45.360
So, make sure to check them out, and a huge thanks to Ting

43:45.360 --> 43:48.600
for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

43:48.600 --> 43:52.480
I hear a lot of talk about mesh networking.

43:52.480 --> 43:55.980
And I'm really gonna be interested to hear your opinion,

43:55.980 --> 43:57.360
Wes, because I know that you do

43:57.360 --> 43:59.160
a lot of system administration.

43:59.160 --> 44:01.280
What do you think of mesh networking?

44:02.240 --> 44:04.320
Specifically wireless mesh networking?

44:04.320 --> 44:07.600
I have yet to actually participate in one,

44:07.600 --> 44:09.780
but I eye them with much interest.

44:09.780 --> 44:11.120
I would like to,

44:11.120 --> 44:12.880
it just seems like a very interesting idea,

44:12.880 --> 44:15.520
sort of as a people's network, if you will,

44:15.520 --> 44:18.400
or even just for isolated communities or otherwise.

44:18.400 --> 44:20.280
And just, it may not always be

44:20.280 --> 44:21.760
the most efficient design necessarily,

44:21.760 --> 44:24.560
but having all the nodes be able to talk to each other,

44:24.560 --> 44:27.240
have this sort of network that you can dynamically

44:27.240 --> 44:30.760
add things to, build, take away, reshape as you need to,

44:30.760 --> 44:32.760
and have connections be resilient.

44:32.760 --> 44:34.440
It seems like it could have a lot of places,

44:34.440 --> 44:36.580
especially as we do more like IoT things,

44:36.580 --> 44:38.600
you have more connected devices all around

44:38.600 --> 44:39.800
in many different places.

44:39.800 --> 44:42.800
I will tell you something, I'm gonna burst anyone's bubble

44:42.800 --> 44:44.640
that is really excited about mesh networking,

44:44.640 --> 44:48.360
particularly over wireless, it is not scalable,

44:48.360 --> 44:51.320
and it is the most inefficient use of bandwidth

44:51.320 --> 44:52.800
known to man.

44:52.800 --> 44:56.240
So if you have this dream that someday

44:56.240 --> 44:58.800
you and your neighbors are gonna each buy a radio,

44:58.800 --> 45:00.920
and you're all gonna put them in your neighborhood,

45:00.920 --> 45:03.200
and one guy's gonna pay for the internet connection,

45:03.200 --> 45:04.360
and he's gonna send it to you,

45:04.360 --> 45:05.840
and you're gonna send it to the next guy,

45:05.840 --> 45:07.460
and he's gonna send it to the guy after him,

45:07.460 --> 45:10.280
and you are living in a pipe dream.

45:10.280 --> 45:11.920
It is never gonna happen.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.040
It never works.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.280
It cannot work.

45:14.280 --> 45:17.720
It is so inefficient, you can get two or three hops,

45:17.720 --> 45:20.980
or maybe four, or maybe five, and then it's dead.

45:20.980 --> 45:22.560
So, I'm just wondering.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.960
Well, what if the goal isn't perhaps efficiency?

45:24.960 --> 45:29.240
What if in some use case of any communication,

45:29.240 --> 45:31.880
or connection, or signaling is better than none?

45:31.880 --> 45:33.960
I'm gonna say, and William, I'd be interested

45:33.960 --> 45:35.640
to get your take on this.

45:35.640 --> 45:37.680
I'm gonna say by the ninth, or 10th hop,

45:37.680 --> 45:39.320
or 12th hop, somewhere in there,

45:39.320 --> 45:42.360
I'm gonna guess it's totally unusable.

45:42.360 --> 45:43.200
Is that fair?

45:45.640 --> 45:46.480
It's kind of hard to say,

45:46.480 --> 45:47.840
depending on the latency of all the links.

45:47.840 --> 45:49.720
I mean, you take many hops through the internet,

45:49.720 --> 45:50.720
so it wouldn't be unreasonable

45:50.720 --> 45:53.080
to do many through the mesh network.

45:53.080 --> 45:56.160
Yeah, but you're not, maybe 30 hops would be bad.

45:56.160 --> 45:57.000
Right.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.580
But yeah, okay, I mean, we can pick a number,

45:58.580 --> 46:02.040
but you're bottlenecking every step of the way down, right?

46:02.040 --> 46:04.280
Like, at some point it comes to a grinding halt.

46:04.280 --> 46:05.840
Oh, absolutely, well, you're adding latency

46:05.840 --> 46:06.960
every single step of the way down.

46:06.960 --> 46:08.640
You're adding more potentials for congestion

46:08.640 --> 46:10.400
and all sorts of stuff, so yes.

46:10.400 --> 46:12.160
But what I'm saying is, like, the guy at the top,

46:12.160 --> 46:15.320
if he has, let's say, a 10 meg link,

46:15.320 --> 46:19.080
and now the guy below him, everyone has a 10 meg link,

46:19.080 --> 46:20.580
but the guy at the top is funneling

46:20.580 --> 46:22.500
everyone below him's traffic.

46:22.500 --> 46:24.280
So, you know, if you're third in line or whatever,

46:24.280 --> 46:26.120
like, everything that's below you

46:26.120 --> 46:27.960
is getting passed through your network,

46:27.960 --> 46:29.800
and ultimately hits your upstream pipe.

46:29.800 --> 46:33.400
Like, it just, the very concept is impossible.

46:33.400 --> 46:34.240
It can never work.

46:34.240 --> 46:35.060
At least.

46:35.060 --> 46:35.900
But you're talking about, like,

46:35.900 --> 46:37.600
some kind of centralized architecture, I think,

46:37.600 --> 46:39.880
where you have a small pipe way upstream

46:39.880 --> 46:41.320
and you're getting funneled into that,

46:41.320 --> 46:43.600
but it doesn't necessarily have to work that way.

46:43.600 --> 46:44.680
Yeah, it could be a mesh network

46:44.680 --> 46:46.360
where there are many paths through the network

46:46.360 --> 46:48.620
and based on congestion avoidance algorithms,

46:48.620 --> 46:50.680
you pick different paths.

46:50.680 --> 46:53.360
Well, a company claims to have figured this out.

46:53.360 --> 46:55.460
This article comes from The Wirecutter,

46:55.460 --> 46:57.920
and basically, this is the best

46:57.920 --> 47:00.480
Wi-Fi mesh networking kits for most people.

47:00.480 --> 47:01.520
And they basically went through

47:01.520 --> 47:02.980
and evaluated a bunch of these kits,

47:02.980 --> 47:06.120
and they settled on the Netgear Orbi,

47:06.120 --> 47:08.660
which they say is the best for most people.

47:08.660 --> 47:10.540
And basically, what it is, is it's a kit

47:10.540 --> 47:13.200
that you can put access points all over your house

47:13.200 --> 47:15.040
and have mesh networking.

47:15.040 --> 47:17.640
So basically, you plug the first one into a router,

47:17.640 --> 47:20.720
and then you put these little hops all over your house,

47:20.720 --> 47:24.080
and then you can get the supposed perfect Wi-Fi network.

47:24.080 --> 47:25.800
Okay, so these are the localized mesh networks,

47:25.800 --> 47:29.040
like an Eero or the Google, whatever Wi-Fi thing?

47:29.040 --> 47:32.040
Yeah, I think that's what they're comparing them to.

47:32.040 --> 47:33.880
Yeah, Eero, yeah, mm-hmm.

47:33.880 --> 47:35.440
Okay.

47:35.440 --> 47:38.360
Which, admittedly, will you probably have better success with

47:38.360 --> 47:41.320
than trying to do like a neighborhood network,

47:41.320 --> 47:42.160
which is what I hear about.

47:42.160 --> 47:43.560
Yeah, I was thinking this is way different

47:43.560 --> 47:45.600
than your larger scale mesh network

47:45.600 --> 47:48.160
of maybe thousands of nodes,

47:48.160 --> 47:50.260
where this is only gonna go to like four or five,

47:50.260 --> 47:53.720
maybe 10. Right, so I think that you'd have,

47:53.720 --> 47:55.040
I think you'd have better luck.

47:55.040 --> 47:56.600
Here's the thing.

47:56.600 --> 47:59.240
Well, these are all pretty low bandwidth nodes.

48:00.200 --> 48:01.720
This could definitely screw you,

48:01.720 --> 48:03.680
and depending on what parts of the spectrum they use

48:03.680 --> 48:04.980
to transmit between each other,

48:04.980 --> 48:07.200
this could actually be pretty slow.

48:07.200 --> 48:08.920
Can you dive into that a little bit?

48:08.920 --> 48:10.280
So I think for the Google Wi-Fi,

48:10.280 --> 48:11.540
you can actually wire them all up

48:11.540 --> 48:13.200
like a normal access point system,

48:13.200 --> 48:15.200
say like your Unifies or something,

48:15.200 --> 48:16.520
and then you don't have any of the bandwidth

48:16.520 --> 48:17.360
sharing problems.

48:17.360 --> 48:18.280
They're all separate APs,

48:18.280 --> 48:20.560
and they all connect back over a wired interface.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.080
That wouldn't be a mesh network, though.

48:22.080 --> 48:23.680
No, it wouldn't be a mesh network,

48:23.680 --> 48:25.240
but it would achieve the same purpose,

48:25.240 --> 48:27.240
which is to cover your whole house in Wi-Fi.

48:27.240 --> 48:29.080
So that's kind of where I was going with this.

48:29.080 --> 48:31.500
If we live, at least here in the United States,

48:31.500 --> 48:33.480
where we have Western construction homes,

48:33.480 --> 48:35.880
I have yet to be inside of a residential construction

48:35.880 --> 48:37.560
where I can't get access to the attic.

48:37.560 --> 48:38.840
Sometimes it means cutting a little hole

48:38.840 --> 48:40.220
out of the sheet rock, but.

48:40.220 --> 48:42.080
But you'll just patch that up later, it's fine.

48:42.080 --> 48:45.200
You could, or you could simply just put a little door on it

48:45.200 --> 48:46.480
and then you have access to your attic,

48:46.480 --> 48:48.000
which I don't know why you would not want access

48:48.000 --> 48:49.440
to your attic.

48:49.440 --> 48:53.120
It is, Cat 6 is so cheap, and I mean so cheap.

48:53.120 --> 48:56.060
I mean, we're talking two, three cents a foot, if that.

48:56.060 --> 48:59.100
Why would you not just run wires in your house?

48:59.100 --> 48:59.940
Why would you, why would you?

48:59.940 --> 49:01.480
Because you don't want to tear up your walls

49:01.480 --> 49:02.520
or your ceilings or whatever.

49:02.520 --> 49:04.600
It may be easy in some types of construction,

49:04.600 --> 49:06.400
but in others, and some people just aren't capable

49:06.400 --> 49:08.280
of dealing with it or don't want to hire a contractor

49:08.280 --> 49:09.120
or whatnot.

49:09.120 --> 49:09.960
Or they value their time.

49:09.960 --> 49:12.640
It makes it easier to just take all these nodes,

49:12.640 --> 49:14.480
throw them next to random power outlets

49:14.480 --> 49:16.100
and kind of spread them throughout your house,

49:16.100 --> 49:18.560
and then have them all automatically connect to each other

49:18.560 --> 49:20.760
and go back to one central point.

49:20.760 --> 49:21.600
It doesn't make it easier.

49:21.600 --> 49:25.480
You know, it's the wireless range extender all over again,

49:25.480 --> 49:27.280
but they're more easy to manage set up.

49:27.280 --> 49:29.020
So you don't have a separate router

49:29.020 --> 49:31.200
from a separate wireless range extender.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.040
It's all the same device,

49:33.040 --> 49:35.400
and it just configures itself for you.

49:35.400 --> 49:37.160
How'd those range extenders work out?

49:37.160 --> 49:38.280
They were terrible.

49:39.640 --> 49:41.560
But that's not to say with five gigahertz band

49:41.560 --> 49:42.900
and everything, it couldn't be better today

49:42.900 --> 49:45.240
because you have a lot more wireless channels to deal with.

49:45.240 --> 49:48.040
And as long as you place them somewhat close to each other,

49:48.040 --> 49:50.480
you do potentially have more bandwidth too.

49:50.480 --> 49:52.760
And your far away nodes may only need, you know,

49:52.760 --> 49:54.080
like 20 megabit.

49:54.080 --> 49:56.340
You're not trying to do like gigabit rate file transfers

49:56.340 --> 49:57.520
across all your mesh network.

49:57.520 --> 50:00.520
You're just trying to like access Facebook in these cases.

50:01.760 --> 50:04.560
Definitely targeting a very simple user.

50:06.960 --> 50:08.440
If you're hooking up internet of things,

50:08.440 --> 50:11.640
I'm guessing that might be useful to have something

50:11.640 --> 50:15.360
that's not the best for bandwidth,

50:15.360 --> 50:18.520
but you know, that'll cover your millions of devices.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.680
And to address everyone in the chat,

50:23.680 --> 50:25.760
yes, wifi kind of sucks and wired is better,

50:25.760 --> 50:28.560
but sometimes, and depending on your technical capability,

50:28.560 --> 50:29.400
you don't have a choice.

50:29.400 --> 50:30.720
Yeah, and sometimes one is good enough

50:30.720 --> 50:32.640
and you don't really, you know, diminishing returns

50:32.640 --> 50:35.080
would get you to wired and you really don't need it.

50:35.080 --> 50:36.340
Yep.

50:36.340 --> 50:37.180
I'm gonna go ahead.

50:37.180 --> 50:38.160
Especially if you're just using Facebook.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.420
We can, I guess we can, what's the old saying?

50:40.420 --> 50:41.620
We can agree to disagree.

50:41.620 --> 50:45.420
I don't think there is a time when I could look somebody

50:45.420 --> 50:48.360
in the face and tell them, you know, I mean,

50:48.360 --> 50:50.400
if you're looking at what, like what we charge

50:50.400 --> 50:53.640
through structured wiring, I bet we could easily do,

50:53.640 --> 50:56.800
you know, an average 2,500 square foot house,

50:56.800 --> 51:01.240
I would say 200 bucks, 250 bucks to drop some,

51:01.240 --> 51:03.200
to put in some, put in some structured wiring

51:03.200 --> 51:05.240
and put in some access points.

51:05.240 --> 51:06.480
I just, I'm not seeing it.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.640
I'm really not seeing the, the,

51:08.640 --> 51:09.800
That's your cost.

51:09.800 --> 51:10.640
I mean, Yeah, exactly.

51:10.640 --> 51:13.340
You're gonna be paying a contractor thousands of dollars

51:13.340 --> 51:14.180
just to get in there and do that.

51:14.180 --> 51:15.840
No, no, no, come on now.

51:15.840 --> 51:16.880
A licensed contract?

51:16.880 --> 51:19.760
I just, I mean, I pay electrician to come in

51:19.760 --> 51:20.840
and run service.

51:20.840 --> 51:23.160
They're gonna charge me, not for the materials

51:23.160 --> 51:24.120
but for the time.

51:24.120 --> 51:25.200
Right, but that's different.

51:25.200 --> 51:26.160
That's different though.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.680
You need a licensed electrician when you're working

51:27.680 --> 51:29.220
with 110, this is low voltage.

51:29.220 --> 51:33.600
There is no, there's basically, other than you can't share,

51:33.600 --> 51:36.420
so electrical wiring has to be strapped every two feet

51:36.420 --> 51:37.440
or three feet or whatever it is, right?

51:37.440 --> 51:39.400
And you can't share a strap with low voltage.

51:39.400 --> 51:42.560
But aside from that, there really isn't a lot of regulation

51:42.560 --> 51:44.480
on where you can throw low voltage wire.

51:44.480 --> 51:45.440
I mean, you can go up in an attic

51:45.440 --> 51:46.600
and throw it around if you want.

51:46.600 --> 51:48.400
Well, but you're gonna have to pay more for plenum wire,

51:48.400 --> 51:49.960
technically, to be within code.

51:51.040 --> 51:52.840
There are a lot of places that make it easy to run

51:52.840 --> 51:54.080
if you're not actually.

51:54.080 --> 51:55.360
Yeah, if you're not strapping.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.200
Yeah.

51:56.200 --> 51:58.960
Well, I mean, you can buy plastic straps too.

51:58.960 --> 52:00.040
I did the janky thing.

52:00.040 --> 52:01.880
I bought really cheap Cat 6

52:01.880 --> 52:04.200
and I ran it through plenum space through air ducts

52:04.200 --> 52:06.920
and I don't care, but I'm gonna have to rip that out

52:06.920 --> 52:08.360
at some point if we sell the house.

52:08.360 --> 52:09.720
Right, right, yeah.

52:09.720 --> 52:13.960
So, I mean, I don't know where you live

52:13.960 --> 52:15.720
that you think it would be thousands of dollars

52:15.720 --> 52:17.800
to have somebody come put some low voltage wiring in,

52:17.800 --> 52:22.240
but I gotta tell you, I mean, I know a lot of people

52:22.240 --> 52:24.640
in the industry and people that do this all over the country

52:24.640 --> 52:29.200
and I think $500, especially,

52:29.200 --> 52:30.360
depending on how big the house is,

52:30.360 --> 52:33.160
I mean, really, I could cover a 2,500 square foot house

52:33.160 --> 52:37.160
with one, two, maybe at the most three access points.

52:37.160 --> 52:40.280
And so, three runs of wire and then down into a basement

52:40.280 --> 52:41.560
or out into a garage or something like that

52:41.560 --> 52:46.200
into a punch panel, I'm not seeing the return on investment

52:46.200 --> 52:48.800
for what you're gonna pay for this system

52:48.800 --> 52:50.520
and for what you're gonna get out of it

52:50.520 --> 52:53.280
versus hiring a professional to come and drop some wire in

52:53.280 --> 52:54.320
and then you put your access points.

52:54.320 --> 52:56.400
And the great thing about putting wire in

52:56.400 --> 52:59.400
is you can go and upgrade the access points

52:59.400 --> 53:01.160
and you got an all new system.

53:01.160 --> 53:05.520
You know, when it goes from 802.11n to G,

53:05.520 --> 53:08.160
or sorry, other way, G to N and then to AC,

53:08.160 --> 53:11.200
I just replace the access points and I'm good to go.

53:11.200 --> 53:14.640
I don't know, I guess it works for some people

53:14.640 --> 53:18.000
and if you're looking for a cheap solution

53:18.000 --> 53:20.720
that doesn't require much, I guess,

53:20.720 --> 53:22.080
maybe that's the way to go.

53:22.080 --> 53:26.080
So, anyway, I don't know, it might work for some people.

53:26.080 --> 53:30.480
I am not into, there is a line, I will admit,

53:30.480 --> 53:32.720
where, I'll give you a great example.

53:33.840 --> 53:36.320
There are times when I'm willing to take less

53:36.320 --> 53:39.600
because overall, sometimes less is more.

53:39.600 --> 53:44.600
And a great example of that is when I am going to do my,

53:45.720 --> 53:47.040
when I'm trying to keep up to date

53:47.040 --> 53:48.520
with things that are happening in the field.

53:48.520 --> 53:50.680
It's very difficult for me sometimes

53:50.680 --> 53:54.720
to stay current on some of the things

53:54.720 --> 53:55.600
that are happening in the field

53:55.600 --> 53:58.640
because we don't use everything, right?

53:58.640 --> 54:02.160
You know, I work with some technologies and not others.

54:03.280 --> 54:06.240
How do you stay current with that stuff?

54:06.240 --> 54:07.320
How do you stay up to date?

54:07.320 --> 54:12.320
And typically what I used to do was take a week off of work

54:13.640 --> 54:15.600
and drive to Minneapolis,

54:15.600 --> 54:17.880
which is the closest place to me,

54:17.880 --> 54:22.880
and enroll in a basically one week training session.

54:24.360 --> 54:26.320
And what I'm doing nowadays

54:26.320 --> 54:29.560
is heading over to Linux Academy.

54:29.560 --> 54:31.280
And basically what Linux Academy is,

54:31.280 --> 54:33.400
unlike this mesh network stuff,

54:33.400 --> 54:37.640
Linux Academy actually provides the same quality

54:37.640 --> 54:39.080
of education that I would get

54:39.080 --> 54:41.240
if I was at a training session.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.240
And I know this because I have done

54:43.240 --> 54:44.680
the in-classroom training,

54:44.680 --> 54:47.240
and I have done remote training.

54:47.240 --> 54:48.600
I have done all of it.

54:48.600 --> 54:53.600
And I paid $2,600 for an instructor

54:54.360 --> 54:58.480
to sit and teach a class remotely.

54:58.480 --> 54:59.640
I took it remotely.

54:59.640 --> 55:02.680
And I remember you couldn't attend the class.

55:02.680 --> 55:04.560
The instructor was, he was doing it basically in his house,

55:04.560 --> 55:07.240
but he didn't invest in a good quality microphone.

55:07.240 --> 55:09.960
And so it basically started like this

55:09.960 --> 55:11.640
the entire time he was talking.

55:11.640 --> 55:13.280
Well, that's just great.

55:13.280 --> 55:14.200
It was terrible.

55:14.200 --> 55:16.920
Like, I could listen to that for hours.

55:16.920 --> 55:19.480
As a person, the speakers that are in my basement

55:19.480 --> 55:20.960
that I listen to my music on

55:20.960 --> 55:23.560
are Sunfire CRM2 ribbon speakers.

55:23.560 --> 55:26.040
I mean, they're $1,800 per cabinet,

55:26.040 --> 55:27.680
and they sound incredible, right?

55:27.680 --> 55:31.440
So as a person who can appreciate that kind of quality,

55:31.440 --> 55:35.480
I'm not, I don't demand like a perfect system,

55:35.480 --> 55:38.480
but oh my God, dude, go to OfficeMax

55:38.480 --> 55:40.840
and spend $35 on a Logitech headset

55:40.840 --> 55:42.440
and you would sound better.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.880
And it was so distracting.

55:44.880 --> 55:47.600
I had a very difficult time comprehending the material.

55:47.600 --> 55:49.920
Well, Linux Academy is,

55:49.920 --> 55:52.520
these instructors are true professionals.

55:52.520 --> 55:56.600
These are the people that they live, eat, and breathe Linux,

55:56.600 --> 55:59.760
and better yet, they live, eat, and breathe teaching.

55:59.760 --> 56:04.280
And if you use our website, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

56:04.280 --> 56:05.640
they're gonna make it even better

56:05.640 --> 56:07.440
because they're gonna make it cheaper.

56:07.440 --> 56:12.440
So what, I guess what I'm trying to say is

56:12.440 --> 56:17.440
this is your opportunity to get the same quality

56:18.640 --> 56:20.720
for a fraction of the price.

56:20.720 --> 56:22.640
Instead of spending two or $3,000,

56:22.640 --> 56:25.360
you can spend 20 or $30,

56:25.360 --> 56:26.920
and you'll come home with the exact same thing

56:26.920 --> 56:28.960
because you'll get the same skills.

56:28.960 --> 56:30.840
Learning is really what you put into it,

56:30.840 --> 56:34.080
not necessarily what you're pulling out.

56:34.080 --> 56:36.120
And so, you know, I always say,

56:36.120 --> 56:38.200
knowledge is the one thing people can't take away from you.

56:38.200 --> 56:39.840
It doesn't, people can put you in prison,

56:39.840 --> 56:40.800
people can take away your money,

56:40.800 --> 56:42.120
they can take away your possessions.

56:42.120 --> 56:43.920
Something that you learn is something you have

56:43.920 --> 56:45.360
for the rest of your life.

56:45.360 --> 56:49.000
So add something, you know, this Christmas season,

56:49.000 --> 56:50.360
maybe you can buy it for somebody else too.

56:50.360 --> 56:51.680
That would be a nice thought.

56:51.680 --> 56:52.880
Paying it forward, you know,

56:52.880 --> 56:55.520
somebody that wants to make a career transition,

56:55.520 --> 56:57.720
maybe buy them a, maybe buy them a membership

56:57.720 --> 56:58.560
to Linux Academy.

56:58.560 --> 56:59.400
That's a great idea.

56:59.400 --> 57:00.680
Yeah, I thought so.

57:00.680 --> 57:01.800
Would you appreciate that?

57:01.800 --> 57:03.120
Heck yes.

57:03.120 --> 57:04.040
Everyone would.

57:04.040 --> 57:07.280
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

57:08.640 --> 57:10.680
So one of the tools I wanted to talk about

57:10.680 --> 57:13.000
that I don't think gets nearly enough attention

57:13.000 --> 57:15.400
for the amount of money that it has made me

57:15.400 --> 57:19.000
and the amount of hassle that it saved me is Clonezilla.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.360
Oh man, I totally agree with that.

57:21.360 --> 57:22.520
Right?

57:22.520 --> 57:25.560
I tell you what, I bet you, just right on the spot,

57:25.560 --> 57:28.760
Wes, tell me the last time you used Clonezilla.

57:28.760 --> 57:32.440
That'd be like two weeks ago, I think.

57:32.440 --> 57:33.680
I don't know, it seems like at least

57:33.680 --> 57:35.960
I can't go with like six months without using Clonezilla

57:35.960 --> 57:37.400
or thinking that I could use Clonezilla

57:37.400 --> 57:38.520
or wanting to use Clonezilla

57:38.520 --> 57:41.240
and being upset that I don't have it on me.

57:41.240 --> 57:44.080
I will also just say Clonezilla is just,

57:44.080 --> 57:46.720
anytime you have an Andrew Gross Live CD or anything else,

57:46.720 --> 57:48.880
Pac-Man does ask Clonezilla, it's there,

57:48.880 --> 57:51.040
you have wifi, you have Clonezilla,

57:51.040 --> 57:52.880
mount, you know, SSHFS something

57:52.880 --> 57:55.200
and then you can just take a Clonezilla of anything.

57:55.200 --> 57:57.360
Anytime I get a new computer, I get a new upgrade,

57:57.360 --> 58:00.160
anything, just bam, take an image of it,

58:00.160 --> 58:01.840
store it away somewhere, delete it in the year

58:01.840 --> 58:02.680
if you don't need it.

58:02.680 --> 58:06.200
You know you always can go right back to where you were.

58:06.200 --> 58:08.840
So we actually have a small USB hard drive

58:08.840 --> 58:11.280
that is in a bag we call the imaging bag

58:11.280 --> 58:14.760
and we take, we have computers that go in

58:14.760 --> 58:18.520
at client locations and we,

58:18.520 --> 58:19.960
the first time we set up that computer,

58:19.960 --> 58:22.720
we take an image of it and so when clients buy,

58:22.720 --> 58:24.520
when they buy computers after that,

58:24.520 --> 58:26.340
instead of having to install and set that up

58:26.340 --> 58:28.320
every single time, we just take that client's image

58:28.320 --> 58:29.480
and dump it onto their computers.

58:29.480 --> 58:31.560
Then when they upgrade and we go to,

58:31.560 --> 58:33.240
you know like we had a client that went from 12,

58:33.240 --> 58:36.120
they just upgraded from 12.04 to 16.04,

58:36.120 --> 58:38.240
then we make a new image and then we roll that image out

58:38.240 --> 58:39.900
and it's been absolutely incredible.

58:39.900 --> 58:41.180
It's a tool that I couldn't live without

58:41.180 --> 58:42.680
and I would pay thousands of dollars,

58:42.680 --> 58:46.840
if that's what it costed, to keep using it

58:46.840 --> 58:47.680
because I need it.

58:47.680 --> 58:50.680
The good news is it is the most advanced

58:50.680 --> 58:54.200
open source disk-cloning utility

58:54.200 --> 58:55.640
and it doesn't cost anything.

58:56.840 --> 58:59.240
This article is saying that it's the first release,

58:59.240 --> 59:04.040
it's the first release to use the kernel from Linux 4.8,

59:04.040 --> 59:05.960
specifically 4.8.7.

59:09.800 --> 59:12.840
We don't talk enough about Clonezilla

59:12.840 --> 59:16.280
and what it does and I'm interested,

59:16.280 --> 59:19.120
is anyone in the mumble room using Clonezilla

59:19.120 --> 59:21.720
for something incredible or just to save their bacon?

59:25.600 --> 59:26.440
I don't know, man.

59:26.440 --> 59:28.560
I would at least like to use it in the future.

59:28.560 --> 59:30.640
I'm really against cloning disks in most cases,

59:30.640 --> 59:33.000
unless the disk is absolutely failing me or something

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
and I want to recover data from it.

59:35.000 --> 59:35.840
Why is that?

59:35.840 --> 59:38.280
I think rebuilding, whenever you have

59:38.280 --> 59:40.080
some kind of catastrophic failure

59:40.080 --> 59:41.600
or you're setting up a new system,

59:41.600 --> 59:44.040
I think rebuilding is just more worthwhile

59:44.040 --> 59:46.320
to give you a fresh file system and everything.

59:46.320 --> 59:48.040
I think I do agree in many cases,

59:48.040 --> 59:51.120
but a NixOS user would say that, I think.

59:52.680 --> 59:53.520
But there are a lot of cases,

59:53.520 --> 59:55.440
and I do really appreciate that Clonezilla

59:55.440 --> 59:58.240
has fancy features so that it at least does take

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.920
like, it won't copy blank space.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:05.560
It's not quite as good as having configuration management

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.000
or an OS where you can really rebuild things very cleanly,

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.800
but it's a much better middle ground

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.200
than just DDing things.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:12.920
So I appreciate that a lot

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.280
and it makes it a lot easier to work with.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.600
What's the disadvantage of using Clonezilla, William?

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.640
If you have, let's say, 50 clients

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.600
and all of those workstations

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.520
are essentially set up identical,

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.640
where is the advantage in building each one

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.080
of those from scratch?

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.560
Or even when one fails, building it back from scratch?

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.920
I guess I'm just not seeing it.

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:43.920
It seems to me that when you wanna deploy something

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.200
at scale, I mean, yes, you can use things like Puppet

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.960
to individually configure those systems,

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.680
but a lot of times, that much intervention is not needed.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.880
And I gotta tell you, as a person who has managed Puppet

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.720
numerous times for numerous different clients

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.480
on numerous different occasions,

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.360
there's a lot of work in setting Puppet up.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.000
It's one of those things I really dread doing.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.360
I think only second to Pixie servers.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.360
I hate setting up Pixie servers.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:09.360
That's a shame, I really like setting up Pixie servers.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.440
I like Pixie.

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.720
I mean, I don't love it, but I appreciate it.

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.680
I feel like I haven't had much trouble with it.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.200
I guess I like what Pixie does,

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.120
but the actual act of setting up the Pixie server,

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.880
do you not run into a bazillion problems

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.040
that you have to troubleshoot along the way?

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:26.080
Yeah, there are, and particular firmware implementations

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:26.920
and those kinds of things.

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.920
I mean, it is at that bottom end of the stack

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.000
that's always kind of troublesome, right?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.080
That just makes my stomach turn just thinking about it.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.080
I do think you do have a point.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.800
I mean, there's, it depends on what your environment is.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.560
It depends on where, what your bottlenecks are.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.400
So I do think there's probably also a middle ground here

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.760
of like, can you make yourself,

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.320
you shouldn't just like make a crude image,

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.200
not clean it up, not set in place,

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.040
first run scripts or other things.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.920
So I think there is a middle ground

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.720
between like just a simple copy of an image

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.640
versus like something that you've set up a nice copy

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.480
that's ready to go.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.920
It boots up, enters a network, configures itself.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.680
Maybe you don't need full configuration management

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.760
like Puppet or Chef or Ansible.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.560
Maybe you do, but there's like, you can have something,

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.960
some stage in the standard image stage

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.360
and some in the configuration management

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.240
and maybe you just need the standard image.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:17.200
Yeah, I don't know if I could go back.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.560
And again, when I compare the two, I'm like, man,

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.360
Puppet would sure be overkill in a lot of situations,

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.120
most situations really, where we have a large deployment

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.200
because you're not making a lot of changes system-wide.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.760
Per class, per host.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.480
Yeah, right, right.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.920
We know with the exceptions of updates

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.000
and software management, and even those,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.920
a lot of times if you're making a lot of changes

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.000
to software management,

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.640
it's because of different roles in the business.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:43.160
You have the graphic designers

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.320
and they needed a different version of this

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.160
or they needed a different program installed or something.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.760
And it's something I wouldn't really want to manage

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.660
at the level because I'm not making those changes

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.120
to every single machine.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.300
Right, one use case I've had a little closer to home

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:58.080
is as Linux users, well, I think the network,

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.200
we do espouse trying to buy from Linux first to vendors,

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.400
but a lot of people end up, certainly I have as well,

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.760
ended up buying a machine that ran Windows

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.720
or maybe you bought a Mac.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.600
And I've used Clonezilla several times

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:11.000
to just take a factory image right there.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.800
If I need to send it in for warranty or something,

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.040
I can just apply that

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.480
and know that they're not going to futz with me about,

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.520
oh, you break your machine.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.020
We're not going to pay for this.

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.800
Right, you know what I've done the last couple of times?

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.080
I just DD the drive and I send it back to them

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.720
and then when they ask what they say anything,

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.440
I'm like, listen, you can go and put whatever you want

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:28.680
on there, but I'm not sending, my excuse is,

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.720
I'm just not sending you a laptop with my data on it.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.800
So I'm wiping the drive before I send it in.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:35.120
And if you need to install something to test,

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.440
then you're welcome to do that.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.780
Most of those guys have, you know,

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.800
drives anyway that they use for troubleshooting

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.120
and actually use user, because they don't have passwords.

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.480
Right, yeah, it's a liability nightmare.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.520
I knew, I know back in, you know, a while back,

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.340
I don't do this anymore,

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:51.760
but I used to keep a Clonezilla image of my laptop.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.480
So if my laptop ever crashed, I could restore

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.360
a already configured and set up version of my laptop.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.200
Anyone doing something like that?

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:02.960
I would like to, but I just don't know how to just yet.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:06.080
I'd say that sounds like a good idea, Noah.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:06.920
Uh-huh.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.520
Yeah, and I would probably do it like maybe

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.580
at least every couple months or so.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.680
Gotta be honest with you, as far as how to do it,

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.440
it's literally as simple as downloading the ISO,

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:19.600
booting off of it, and it asks you questions

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.760
and you answer them.

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.300
They have a super slick system going.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.480
You know, it says, do you want to start Clonezilla?

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.400
Yes, what image, what drive do you want to image?

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.240
This one?

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.160
Which one do you want? Yeah, I love it.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.480
And it'll give you the command too,

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.120
so if later you want to make this like something

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:36.760
you do on a cron job or, you know,

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.360
set up in an automated way somehow,

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.160
they give you like a one line command that you can do

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.520
that'll just do exactly what you,

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.200
the backup that you just performed, which is great.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.480
Oh wow, that's awesome.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.200
I met, actually, I had the privilege

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.600
at last year's Linux Fest Northwest.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.920
There were a couple Clonezilla guys right by

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.240
the Jupiter Broadcasting booth,

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.880
so I spent a little while talking to them

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.000
and I have to say they were very nice to talk to.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.120
They were excited about the project

01:04:58.120 --> 01:04:59.600
and they were surprisingly humble

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.480
for the cool software they've created.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:02.940
Shoot, man, that's really disappointing.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.160
I would have loved to meet those guys.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.000
Well, maybe they'll be back.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.140
We'll just have to hope.

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:07.080
Maybe.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.240
Anyone else have any other closing thoughts

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.800
about Clonezilla or other useful Linux tools

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.920
that don't get enough attention?

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.760
All right.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.580
ProSync.

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:16.720
Yeah, right, ProSync.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.120
All can sit.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.400
Yeah, all right, guys, well, thank you so much

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:21.960
to the Mumba Room for being here.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.440
We really appreciate having you taking time out of your day.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.800
Thank you very much, Wes, for joining me remotely.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.880
My pleasure.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.400
A huge thank you to Michael Tunnell,

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.680
our producer for this show,

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.880
Rekai, our hardworking video editor

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:35.480
who makes everything sound and look amazing,

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.880
and of course, the entire team at Jupiter Broadcasting

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.900
for making this show possible.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.920
You can find out more at jupitabroadcasting.com.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.960
Check me out on Sundays,

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.580
Linux Action Show, where Chris and I host,

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.280
and we'll be back here next Tuesday

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.320
with the same show next week.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.160
Bye.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:06:18.660
Okay, bye.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:38.800
I sit down at my desk and I'm going through links that Wes provided things

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.480
that we're gonna talk about today and I came across this link which was an

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:48.960
article from System76 talking about how they are working with Canonical to

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:56.400
improve high DPI support in Linux now for those of you who don't know high DPI

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:05.120
support in Ubuntu specifically has been kind of a disaster and a lot of laptops

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:08.880
now are shipping with high-resolution display 1080 is the minimum I will

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:16.280
purchase agreed agreed Wes how do you handle working with lower resolution

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:21.760
because I know your XPS that's a 1366 yes unfortunately that's the only one

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:26.000
left in my entire life thankfully how do you how do you work around that you know

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.880
I usually end up using a tiling window manager or something with easy control

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.840
so I can rapidly shift between things and then I'm most places that I end up

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:38.960
going you know if I'm not at a coffee shop or here at the studio I have an

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:43.480
external monitor configured and so at that point it's not such a big deal hmm

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:47.800
yes that makes sense but I mean I would never buy one now it's frustrating even

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:51.360
today that like how in 2016 does the laptop market still have those

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.920
resolutions offered because it's really I mean it was fine for what it is it's

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:59.580
better than no monitor but it is just the worst well I think part of it is

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:06.360
cost right I think a part of it is just that they the manufacturers are you know

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.080
they can get a three two hundred dollar laptop about three hundred dollar laptop

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:13.120
if they're not putting in a terribly expensive display and and that works for

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:18.840
the you know guy or woman that is sitting at home browsing Facebook and

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.440
checking their email doesn't really matter for you know pixel density isn't

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:25.440
a big deal it is a big deal for people like you and I though that work in the

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:29.280
field and need to be able to scale three or four different windows at one time

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:32.480
right yeah exactly right you need to be able to have a lot on your screen at

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:36.840
once you're doing many things at once you know you're professional so 4k has

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:41.000
been a great promise and system 76 has been kind of on the leading edge I don't

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.360
know of a whole lot of other laptops that are shipping with 4k displays you

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.080
know like there's the you know the Google pixel shipped to the high

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:52.960
resolution display when the the XPS does but for the most part you know the the

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:59.000
you're lucky to get a 1080p display most of my 1366 and the problem is if you get

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.080
a 4k display and I have a 4k display on my on my oryx is or no I don't know I

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:10.720
don't I have the 1080 version but if you have a 4k display the problem is it the

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.600
Ubuntu looks terrible all of the buttons are tiny and you can't see them even you

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.320
even if you fix even if you go through like there's a recommended you know like

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.680
kind of tutorial steps that you go through to kind of fix some of the

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:29.280
issues and one of that would be like dragging the the the slider scale and it

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:32.760
increases the windows but that doesn't fix everything so for example Firefox it

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.200
doesn't fix the buttons in Firefox and stuff so that's still huge so then you

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:40.840
have to go to about about colon config and you have to scale Firefox individually

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.760
and just it's it's a very hacked together solution and so it's something

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.240
that's needed some attention for a long time I'm interested this is anyone in

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.560
the mumble room any of you guys using 4k displays and what's your experience been

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:56.240
like under Linux specifically Ubuntu if you've tried it I'm not currently using

01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.880
4k I'm still stuck on 1080p but I am shopping for monitors but I don't feel

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:12.920
4k has or I need more better GPU for 4k okay so you need a better video card but

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:17.600
you would go to 4k oh I thought I totally would but I'm so kind of waiting

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:23.480
for the technology to get up higher for the Hertz for the gaming side because I

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:29.320
hate having monitors that only do one thing I need I need I need color

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:34.440
reproduction I need performance I need reliability all that kind of things and

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:39.000
I hate spending money on just one thing that I'm going to have to replace a year

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.200
or two later to get just the same thing but better quality so yeah so kind of

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:49.960
waiting for 4k to get up there and then display poor and HDMI and all that fun

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:54.480
stuff right right yeah I think that makes a lot of sense anyone else using 4k I

01:10:54.480 --> 01:11:00.960
have to have a laptop that is around 13 inches that's 4k and I have a 27 inch

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.040
HP IPS 4k display now which laptop is that your is that your thing pad yeah no

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:09.480
it's an Asus oh I see okay yeah yeah right no the thing that's actually just

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.800
1080p which yeah and I actually like that more to some extent because scale

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:18.120
isn't an issue for me sure but the 4k at 27 inches is really nice and even though

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:22.320
I do have to scale some things up you get much more clarity and screen

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:27.080
realistic at the larger display size yeah the screen real estate seems seems

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.920
legitimate at a 27 inch I wonder that's not much more expensive if you don't

01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:36.320
want to go like 144 Hertz or something and you're just sticking at 60 Hertz 4k

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.800
is not terribly priced and these are really nice monitors nice stands well

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:47.320
built you agree that do you agree that fit 4k on anything under 15 inches is is

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:53.640
a poor resolution to screen size ratio it's a little ridiculous I don't think

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:58.360
it's necessary I think 1440p around that size is fine and even then you're still

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:05.200
scaling stuff up we'll see how has 4k worked under Linux for you 4k has been

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.680
fine but I mostly run xman ads so I kind of customize everything myself and a lot

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:12.880
of what I do is in the terminal and scaling that up is trivial it's it's

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:17.800
basically just increasing the font size right sure and the browser has add-ons

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.600
and things to deal with high DPI I mostly use Chrome and Firefox so okay

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:25.360
not a big deal so you're so basically your approach is handle every

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:29.960
application individually pretty much mostly because xman ad doesn't give you

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:34.720
anything to deal with it in some unified way yeah sure you could change GTK in a

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:39.120
unified way and QT in a unified way individually but I don't really use that

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.840
many applications and I can deal with the ones that aren't scaled correctly

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:46.240
you have a well-defined set that you have yeah I have a pretty small limited set

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:49.880
of applications and even like Gimp and stuff has been fine though I'm probably

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:53.280
pushing the envelope here a little bit but have you tried Ubuntu by chance

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:58.720
nope I basically only run NixOS and my fork of it so that's what I don't really

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.360
know okay that's fair that's what I'm doing all 1080p and that's on 1404 and

01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:08.560
it's fine yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah today I mean it 1080 even on a I've used

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.000
I mean our ThinkPads you have the same we do we have the same both of us have

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.040
the same laptop at 12.5 inch laptop I find 1080p to be perfectly workable oh

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:22.120
yeah anyone else have experience preferably preferably experience with

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:29.920
Ubuntu on 4k or is that it well long story short I I am happy to see that

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:33.280
somebody is working on this problem because I think in the near future this

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.360
is going to be very important I think all desktop computers are basically

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.600
going to be I think you know obviously 4k is gonna become the next go-to

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:42.920
standard it's certainly going to become the next go-to standard in video

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:48.760
production yep and so this is going to be a very important problem that we need

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:55.080
to tackle and so it's very nice and reassuring to see that you know both

01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:01.080
system 76 and canonical are aware of this problem and working on it and I

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:05.720
and I guess it's kind of just like a thank you to all of the people that work

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:10.160
so hard and put a lot of effort in to make sure that we have the tools that we

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:14.720
need I wish I would have had the tools that I needed this morning to make my

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:19.360
day go well at least I know that down the road when 4k becomes a standard and

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.440
it's just something that we go to and expect it I know it'll be there thanks

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:35.880
to a hard work at system 76 and canonical
