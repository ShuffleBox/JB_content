WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.080
and then everybody hey hey there Joe hey anybody want to say hi to Joe this is

00:07.080 --> 00:14.200
your chance hi Joe hi Joe hey Joe huh I noticed poppy couldn't be bothered that's

00:14.200 --> 00:17.640
interesting that's that's interesting sorry I was busy talking to Neil on

00:17.640 --> 00:33.520
the telegram it's showtime guys

00:33.520 --> 00:39.080
well hello friends and welcome in episode 382 of your weaker Linux talk

00:39.080 --> 00:43.200
show my name is Chris my name is Wes Wes prepare yourself because this episode is

00:43.200 --> 00:45.920
brought to you by the all-new cloud guru the leader in learning for cloud Linux

00:45.920 --> 00:49.120
and other modern tech skills hundreds of courses thousands of hands-on labs get

00:49.120 --> 00:55.640
certified get hired get learning a cloud guru calm yeah so this episode is it's

00:55.640 --> 01:01.520
my coming out I have a big secret that I have to reveal that will be will be laid

01:01.520 --> 01:06.520
bare in front of all of you for your own judgments later in this show and then we

01:06.520 --> 01:11.560
thought it'd be a decent time to check in on the plucky little distro endeavor

01:11.560 --> 01:16.000
OS which you'll probably remember came up out of the ashes of enter gross which

01:16.000 --> 01:21.200
was a arch based distro that really kind of aimed at getting pretty close to

01:21.200 --> 01:25.560
upstream arch and endeavor OS when it launched we took a first look at it and

01:25.560 --> 01:30.600
we said this is interesting but it needs some work we're gonna come back at it

01:30.600 --> 01:34.840
and now here we are towards the end of 2020 they've had a couple of releases

01:34.840 --> 01:41.540
and it's kind of an opportunity to do a state of the distro so we'll give you a

01:41.540 --> 01:45.080
new update and a couple of things that I found really surprising and then sort

01:45.080 --> 01:48.680
of led to a whole series of revelations but we've also got a bunch of community

01:48.680 --> 01:52.400
news to get into something we're launching that we want to tell you about

01:52.400 --> 01:55.960
so before we do any of that I got to say hello to the virtual lug time

01:55.960 --> 01:59.240
appropriate greetings bumble room

01:59.240 --> 02:09.360
what a crew today how about that was how about that huh you know they are mighty

02:09.360 --> 02:14.760
and powerful in there in the virtual lug if you want to join our mumble room and

02:14.760 --> 02:18.400
get your voice on the show we have all the info on our website at linux

02:18.400 --> 02:22.880
unplug calm what you do is when you're in there you just tag me in the IRC mum

02:22.880 --> 02:26.440
Chris last with a little description of what you want to say and then I'll

02:26.440 --> 02:29.400
generally work you into the show and I'll call on you live and you can have

02:29.400 --> 02:32.320
your thoughts on whatever we're talking about I don't always call sometimes we're

02:32.320 --> 02:35.480
like moving on and I won't call on you but that's basically how it works so you

02:35.480 --> 02:39.240
can get information about how to set up mumble which is an open source VoIP app

02:39.240 --> 02:43.000
at our website Linux unplug calm let's start with our announcement first

02:43.000 --> 02:46.520
because we have kind of some disappointing community news but I want

02:46.520 --> 02:50.920
to start with the good you know there's been a lot this year Wes there's been a

02:50.920 --> 02:54.560
lot worse I've seen it all and we thought we could do something kind of

02:54.560 --> 02:58.040
fun we were inspired by some friends of ours and other podcasts out there and

02:58.040 --> 03:03.000
we're gonna we're gonna announce right here on the show get ready for this

03:03.000 --> 03:08.840
ladies and gentlemen I am proud I am excited I am stoked to announce the

03:08.840 --> 03:16.040
Linux unplugged is launching the 2020 tuxes that's right a special segment

03:16.040 --> 03:22.740
right here on the show and you can help nominate your favorite projects we use

03:22.740 --> 03:28.500
that term loosely and other tech for 2020 tuxes and we will at the end of the

03:28.500 --> 03:34.000
year we will announce the winners of the tuxes and they will be sent a 3d printed

03:34.000 --> 03:39.160
tuxi award with what they won on there and it'll also serve as a fantastic

03:39.160 --> 03:42.900
resource for you to get an idea of what projects and distros are really

03:42.900 --> 03:45.680
resonating with the community this year it might give you an idea of something

03:45.680 --> 03:49.740
you could check out and I think it's just gonna be a great way for us to get

03:49.740 --> 03:53.360
an idea of what you all love and what we love and then to send them a little

03:53.360 --> 03:56.560
thank you at the end of the year saying thanks for making that thing that we

03:56.560 --> 04:00.280
love so much and our audience voted you the best a nice way to reflect on the

04:00.280 --> 04:04.240
year and I mean we've covered so many great things on the show plus a bunch of

04:04.240 --> 04:07.600
stuff that didn't make it in I've already forgotten about half of it I'm

04:07.600 --> 04:11.000
sure you've forgotten even more so we really need some help making a good list

04:11.000 --> 04:15.240
yeah and I wanted to be something kind of special so the distros they they can

04:15.240 --> 04:18.080
receive or whatever it is a project there's you'll see all the categories

04:18.080 --> 04:21.400
and I want to expand those two this is just the first year but I think we could

04:21.400 --> 04:24.060
do this every year and I'd like to expand it and get your input on what

04:24.060 --> 04:28.220
other categories we could include so it's just a form you go fill it out with

04:28.220 --> 04:32.640
some questions about favorite this best that worst evens in there I think on

04:32.640 --> 04:36.780
something and then we'll collect all the results we'll submit it to the committee

04:36.780 --> 04:40.700
and then we'll announce the winners on the show we do get some vote power in

04:40.700 --> 04:44.000
that mix but we're also gonna include we're gonna submit it ourselves so we

04:44.000 --> 04:46.800
need to get as much input as we can because I'd like this to be reflective

04:46.800 --> 04:50.360
of the audience so we're gonna run this for a little while the link will be in

04:50.360 --> 04:55.480
the show notes for the 2020 unplugged tuxes and of course it also gave me an

04:55.480 --> 05:01.440
excuse to include a super a super duper mega retro Jupiter broadcasting beat if

05:01.440 --> 05:05.360
you get this deep cut then you've been listening for a really long time and

05:05.360 --> 05:10.200
this is the official tuxes theme music

05:10.200 --> 05:16.700
I'll see how long it takes until somebody can figure out where that's

05:16.700 --> 05:21.840
from now let's talk about the community news we'll do the tuxes soon but please

05:21.840 --> 05:25.820
do go get your submissions in but we need to start with what appears to be

05:25.820 --> 05:30.780
some super bad news for a reason the Linux PC manufacturer that sold

05:30.780 --> 05:36.980
desktops and laptops it appears they've shut down entirely they say as many of

05:36.980 --> 05:40.540
you've noticed our product line is getting smaller and our tech support has

05:40.540 --> 05:44.740
been slowing down to a crawl unfortunately the pandemic has been the

05:44.740 --> 05:50.820
final ko blow or knockout blow that's what they write and it's hit our little

05:50.820 --> 05:55.780
town hard and we have not been able to recover from it as of Tuesday November

05:55.780 --> 06:01.900
24th 2020 za reason is no longer in business if you have a computer from us

06:01.900 --> 06:07.680
we hope that it gives you a long and solid lifespan if it does not and you

06:07.680 --> 06:12.300
would like warranty work done we regret there are no employees who can answer

06:12.300 --> 06:18.500
those questions or do service repair employees usually want to be paid and

06:18.500 --> 06:23.900
without sales there's no income to pay them yeah that is really unfortunate and

06:23.900 --> 06:27.500
they they have an in tiny text at the bottom let me zoom in and hands here

06:27.500 --> 06:31.660
they say note that when a business dies its warranty dies with it we know this

06:31.660 --> 06:36.580
part is hard to accept it is sad disappointing and unsurprising that our

06:36.580 --> 06:40.820
reason is shutting down this is them saying this there are many many reasons

06:40.820 --> 06:44.860
but sickness and part shortages are the top two at this point there is no other

06:44.860 --> 06:48.780
option we wish you the best and we hope you and your computers are healthy and

06:48.780 --> 06:52.940
we help you and your computers are healthy and thriving a colonel you have

06:52.940 --> 06:56.460
some experience with our reason yeah so I haven't actually owned any of their

06:56.460 --> 07:02.020
machines but there's a convention that I have met them at personally and they

07:02.020 --> 07:05.700
were really good just down-to-earth people even invited me to come by hang

07:05.700 --> 07:09.500
out with them at their shop if I was ever in the area they're just they were

07:09.500 --> 07:15.460
fantastic wonderful people and I'm sad to see that are having to shut down I

07:15.460 --> 07:22.620
have to say I hadn't considered that the PC parts makers could be having supply

07:22.620 --> 07:28.100
shortages it has slammed the RV industry surprisingly hard because when you have

07:28.100 --> 07:31.220
different areas that are responsible for manufacturing certain parts and there's

07:31.220 --> 07:34.820
been various different lockdowns implemented you've had various kind of

07:34.820 --> 07:40.180
ebbs and flows to the production and so the people downstream from that are kind

07:40.180 --> 07:43.980
of left in the lurch and I hadn't really considered that that could very easily be

07:43.980 --> 07:49.540
affecting PC manufacturers and it honestly makes me wonder about if it's

07:49.540 --> 07:53.660
affected our friends at system 76 because they're just hitting their 15th

07:53.660 --> 07:57.780
birthday and they've you know they've they've really grown but at the same

07:57.780 --> 08:00.860
time they could be vulnerable to some of these same supply chain issues and

08:00.860 --> 08:05.180
perhaps our reason is just not nearly as well positioned as system 76 but I

08:05.180 --> 08:10.220
don't know I just I worry yeah it's a wake-up call I think yeah it is it's

08:10.220 --> 08:12.780
something you had I hadn't really it would be really kind of it'd be really

08:12.780 --> 08:16.340
sad to see this spread you know there's other there's other manufacturers out

08:16.340 --> 08:21.220
there we wouldn't want to see go I think from a competitive positioning

08:21.220 --> 08:25.140
perhaps our reason wasn't necessarily the most competitive of the bunch though

08:25.140 --> 08:29.100
but we haven't seen this happen for a while we haven't seen a Linux hardware

08:29.100 --> 08:33.100
vendor shut down recently we've seen a lot launch but I suppose it was

08:33.100 --> 08:36.260
inevitable and also just a little bit sad since they've been going since I

08:36.260 --> 08:42.140
think 2007 yeah Jill you had some thoughts on czar reason yeah I was so

08:42.140 --> 08:47.500
sad to hear this there are actually personal friends of ours at the Linux

08:47.500 --> 08:51.940
chicks of Los Angeles there they were stalwarts at the Southern California

08:51.940 --> 08:56.300
Linux Expo they had a booth every year for a lot of years and I got to know

08:56.300 --> 09:00.660
their family very well and they even donated equipment to the Linux chicks of

09:00.660 --> 09:06.060
Los Angeles and I have have one of my favorite they make a wonderful stuffed

09:06.060 --> 09:12.100
pen penguin text penguin it's so cute well it's that's a great story yeah but

09:12.100 --> 09:19.540
I just I'm just very very sad because a lot of lot of the Linux chicks have have

09:19.540 --> 09:24.940
have their computers and this is just very disappointing and they their

09:24.940 --> 09:30.020
computers are still running great I have a very old dual core laptop of theirs

09:30.020 --> 09:36.700
and it runs beautifully still hopefully will for a while yeah Neil you have some

09:36.700 --> 09:42.300
thoughts on it too yeah I mean when I found out I was I was incredibly sad and

09:42.300 --> 09:48.260
disappointed like and the reason I found out actually was the saddest of all I

09:48.260 --> 09:53.060
was trying to buy a Linux laptop oh yeah and I went on to their site and found

09:53.060 --> 09:59.700
out that they shut down and it was just it was a blow to me I haven't directly

09:59.700 --> 10:03.860
purchased as our reason laptop from them in years like I mostly got it through

10:03.860 --> 10:08.700
friends who bought one for me or some other circumstances but they were nice

10:08.700 --> 10:13.940
computers and the team was friendly and really they really cared about making a

10:13.940 --> 10:19.180
good Linux experience and making it useful like regardless of Linux

10:19.180 --> 10:23.980
distribution I think that was the that was the thing I valued the most yeah but

10:23.980 --> 10:27.860
the the other part of this you know just about Linux laptop vendors in general

10:27.860 --> 10:34.100
moving a little bit away from our reason the Linux laptop vendors in general do

10:34.100 --> 10:41.820
not have a whole lot of marketing power unless you knew someone who knew someone

10:41.820 --> 10:46.140
who who had one from one of these vendors I don't think you would know if

10:46.140 --> 10:49.580
they existed I think system 76 is an aberration in this regard and and

10:49.580 --> 10:55.600
tuxedo computers in Germany is a similar aberration but like most Linux laptop

10:55.600 --> 11:00.780
vendors or Linux desktop vendors many of them exist but many of them aren't known

11:00.780 --> 11:05.940
and I think they basically operated on like what you call family business

11:05.940 --> 11:13.180
margins and budgets and and something like this pandemic which induced all

11:13.180 --> 11:18.160
kinds of interesting supply shortages people shortages all that sort of thing

11:18.160 --> 11:24.060
they don't have the powder on hand the cash to weather that and this is what

11:24.060 --> 11:31.020
happens and so if we wanted to have more Linux laptop or desktop vendors you know

11:31.020 --> 11:37.260
survive really the way to do that is to help promote them and bring them out you

11:37.260 --> 11:41.420
know from the shadows of being just you know these little shops that help people

11:41.420 --> 11:47.060
to being known to the greater community so that they can be supported in the

11:47.060 --> 11:50.580
same way we did with system 76 when they came out when they came out with a

11:50.580 --> 11:54.860
splash with their with their brand and their first laptops you know all those

11:54.860 --> 12:01.140
years ago yeah I myself wasn't a customer but it it does it does remind me

12:01.140 --> 12:05.220
that it is it is important that we buy locally essentially that we buy it when

12:05.220 --> 12:10.500
we can buy from a place that is selling it as a Linux product if that's system

12:10.500 --> 12:16.900
76 or maybe it's Dell or Lenovo now it's you buy it in that ecosystem to keep it

12:16.900 --> 12:21.540
strong because of when you buy a machine preloaded with Windows and we all have

12:21.540 --> 12:24.780
to do it from time to time I suppose I'm not shaming anyone but it is

12:24.780 --> 12:30.300
essentially it's a vote for the Windows marketplace it's a it furthers and

12:30.300 --> 12:33.300
that's that's the tricky thing here is it makes me think we got to remember

12:33.300 --> 12:37.500
that and there's a lot of hype right now about Apple's m1 and how exciting it

12:37.500 --> 12:41.140
would be to get Linux on there but I think ultimately when you look at what

12:41.140 --> 12:45.460
serves us as a community long term it's it's buying locally from these from

12:45.460 --> 12:48.460
these vendors well and it's a little more tricky these days too with you know

12:48.460 --> 12:52.220
great Linux support coming from companies like Lenovo and Dell and I

12:52.220 --> 12:54.300
think you just got to make sure it's on your list of you know when you're

12:54.300 --> 12:56.660
assessing a new laptop Chris you've been you've been going through this

12:56.660 --> 13:00.340
there's a lot of different trade-offs and I think that item of is this a

13:00.340 --> 13:04.340
business that needs my business and would that help the community well it

13:04.340 --> 13:07.300
should at least be somewhere on your list even if it's not the only factor

13:07.300 --> 13:10.380
yeah there's a lot of things to consider I don't think it can be the sole factor

13:10.380 --> 13:15.060
I don't think you should buy just for that reason solely alone but it

13:15.060 --> 13:19.540
definitely has influenced my shopping I am NOT gonna buy anything that comes

13:19.540 --> 13:24.380
preloaded with Windows for this very reason but let's talk about these m1 max

13:24.380 --> 13:28.620
because there is a lot of interest like it or not I think you could make a

13:28.620 --> 13:31.980
really solid argument that the effort that we're about to talk about would be

13:31.980 --> 13:36.780
better spent on pursuing open platforms and I think a lot of us feel that way

13:36.780 --> 13:43.140
but I don't think that takes away from concurrent tasks of making it possible

13:43.140 --> 13:48.420
there's some value in making it possible to run Linux on the m1 Apple machines

13:48.420 --> 13:54.180
and it seems that Hector Martin has launched a patreon I invited him on the

13:54.180 --> 13:57.420
show but it was such short timing I don't think it's it was gonna work out

13:57.420 --> 14:02.140
but he's launched a patreon that he's pausing billing on until it reaches

14:02.140 --> 14:08.220
$4,000 a month that will in theory be a commitment that he can use to

14:08.220 --> 14:14.180
essentially pay for his time to convert or I guess port or whatever you want to

14:14.180 --> 14:18.940
call it make it possible to boot and run Linux on these m1 max which I guess he

14:18.940 --> 14:24.180
has some experience in this area what's your read on this Wes long shot well I

14:24.180 --> 14:28.460
think it'll just it'll just be tough what will be tricky I think is deciding

14:28.460 --> 14:32.340
what's the right level I think there's a lot of interest seemingly already

14:32.340 --> 14:35.820
they've crossed that threshold in in donations where it looks like it you

14:35.820 --> 14:39.700
know it it will get funded at least of the 4,000 although the goal itself

14:39.700 --> 14:46.860
they're not all complete but getting it to like a really solid experience that

14:46.860 --> 14:50.280
you don't have to be so heavily motivated by Linux to make it worthwhile

14:50.280 --> 14:55.780
especially with so many changes in the m1 things like the the new Apple silicon

14:55.780 --> 15:01.140
GPU involved it's just gonna be a long March you're right you know there's some

15:01.140 --> 15:06.580
history here he was hacking on Linux on the ps4 for instance clearly a talented

15:06.580 --> 15:11.460
individual it's just gonna be a long time I think even if it goes as well as

15:11.460 --> 15:16.940
possible you know even if it gets workable I guess we check back in in two

15:16.940 --> 15:22.860
three years and by that time well how will Linux be doing on the m5 it seems

15:22.860 --> 15:28.980
to me the only shot this thing really has is if Apple supplies some kind of at

15:28.980 --> 15:34.860
least if not code documentation of how the disk controller works or how to

15:34.860 --> 15:39.460
interface with the necessary components of of those disk controllers and whatnot

15:39.460 --> 15:45.540
because getting Linux to boot on the m1 while valuable is not nearly as valuable

15:45.540 --> 15:50.380
as actually being able to install and run it on the physical disk and and use

15:50.380 --> 15:55.220
all of those components but unlike getting like around just a bootloader

15:55.220 --> 15:59.900
which apparently Apple does have provisions to allow users to unlock the

15:59.900 --> 16:03.340
bootloader and install whatever OS they want they they've apparently built that

16:03.340 --> 16:07.420
into these m1 Macs but it's not just that right it's it's the drivers for

16:07.420 --> 16:12.060
everything in this thing because it's all custom to Apple it may be from some

16:12.060 --> 16:16.060
vendors upstream then we can once we figure out who that is we can take large

16:16.060 --> 16:19.620
swaths of another driver and make it work but it's not like getting Linux

16:19.620 --> 16:24.500
running on an Intel Mac where the t2 or the bootloader is your biggest challenge

16:24.500 --> 16:28.100
but then it's Intel motherboard components and it's Intel wireless and

16:28.100 --> 16:31.380
it's Bluetooth that you know how to work with and it's an audio interface that

16:31.380 --> 16:34.820
you know how to work with like these are all going to be different on an m1 Mac

16:34.820 --> 16:42.060
and so the scale of the problem is massive and then of course Apple won't

16:42.060 --> 16:47.700
be sitting still especially at this stage in the m1s lifespan so they very

16:47.700 --> 16:52.820
quickly are going to be iterating on this platform and will leave these m1s in

16:52.820 --> 16:56.900
the dust surely by within two years yeah I think the question there will be you

16:56.900 --> 17:01.140
know how much does the platform change and how much does the basic low-level

17:01.140 --> 17:04.180
sort of communications channels that are needed stay the same and how much you

17:04.180 --> 17:08.180
know is it an iteration or do we see a continued revolution on there on their

17:08.180 --> 17:11.420
new totally custom platform which they have a lot more leeway to change and

17:11.420 --> 17:15.700
like Lin mob says in the IRC room just imagine how difficult it's gonna be to

17:15.700 --> 17:19.180
get the GPU working well so there's some good discussion in the in the Twitter

17:19.180 --> 17:22.140
thread someone asked you know do you think it's gonna be feasible to put an

17:22.140 --> 17:27.260
open stack on Apple's GPU and Hector's responses time will tell but I don't

17:27.260 --> 17:32.700
think it's impossible Nvidia GPUs aren't exactly simple and yet new though exists

17:32.700 --> 17:37.260
and yeah that's definitely true but I think that that is the right context to

17:37.260 --> 17:40.520
look at this you might get something that's usable you might eventually get a

17:40.520 --> 17:43.940
Linux desktop that displays you a desktop and you can use to browse the

17:43.940 --> 17:48.340
web but it won't be all the things you're excited about from the Apple side

17:48.340 --> 17:53.660
of the platform at least anytime soon and that's where I get to imagine this

17:53.660 --> 17:58.980
amount of effort and this skill level being poured into open power PC or risk

17:58.980 --> 18:04.660
five it just seems like so much more benefit from that right it just

18:04.660 --> 18:09.580
ultimately while yes it would be great I feel like what needs to happen is a

18:09.580 --> 18:13.500
shift in perception and maybe Apple will prove me wrong and I actually would love

18:13.500 --> 18:16.700
it if they did but I think we need to shift our perception of these they're

18:16.700 --> 18:21.060
not necessarily computers they're inclusive products they're a holistic

18:21.060 --> 18:25.420
device like your Nintendo switch yeah you can get Linux on there but that's

18:25.420 --> 18:30.500
definitely not what it's meant for it's not a general computing device that's

18:30.500 --> 18:35.100
meant for you to load Windows or your own Linux or freeBSD or or whatever the

18:35.100 --> 18:38.060
hell you want and we have to stop thinking of it that way because that's

18:38.060 --> 18:42.100
just not what the intention is it's it's designed to be the best Mac possible

18:42.100 --> 18:46.220
which is what those customers want and I don't think it's ever gonna be anything

18:46.220 --> 18:53.660
else if Apple comes out with open source drivers or I mean starts working upstream

18:53.660 --> 18:59.260
to make it possible I will be the first to cover it probably quite literally and

18:59.260 --> 19:04.380
I will be the first to congratulate them and retract the statement but I just

19:04.380 --> 19:07.460
don't think it's ever gonna happen I guess time will tell I mean you know you

19:07.460 --> 19:10.700
can't stop hardware hackers from from hacking on things trying to make it work

19:10.700 --> 19:15.300
and it is exciting to see you know what possible gains might be out there but as

19:15.300 --> 19:20.140
ever it is a question of resources and this one won't I won't be planning to

19:20.140 --> 19:24.940
buy M1 hardware for Linux at least anytime soon it has happened it's gotten

19:24.940 --> 19:28.340
it's got up and running on the switch it's it's works on they've got it

19:28.340 --> 19:33.400
working on the PlayStation before it absolutely happens and and somebody will

19:33.400 --> 19:38.620
find a use for it so there's there's that as well so maybe maybe in a year

19:38.620 --> 19:41.860
so I'll be sitting here talking about how I'm thinking about buying an arm

19:41.860 --> 19:46.140
based Mac so that way I can run arch on it maybe it turns into a little you know

19:46.140 --> 19:49.380
little headless box you use for your iOS builds there Chris actually you know

19:49.380 --> 19:53.060
what thinking about it quite literally how I would use it is I would use it as

19:53.060 --> 19:58.180
a way to bring life into older MacBooks so even if the support leg behind if you

19:58.180 --> 20:01.440
know you could take a Mac book that maybe Apple had abandoned and was no

20:01.440 --> 20:05.220
longer shipping Mac OS for but you could get Linux confidently running on it I

20:05.220 --> 20:09.020
think that would be a victory that would be a success if that's the goalpost

20:09.020 --> 20:12.100
ultimately then I'm a hundred percent for it I might even consider backing it

20:12.100 --> 20:15.940
I want it you know what the more the more we talk about this the more I think

20:15.940 --> 20:19.140
I want to talk to Hector and and kind of get his take on it where he thinks it's

20:19.140 --> 20:24.820
going because that could be something I get behind I could talk myself into that

20:24.820 --> 20:30.940
Linode.com slash unplugged get a $100 60-day credit on your new Linode

20:30.940 --> 20:33.900

20:33.900 --> 20:38.380
slash unplugged they're the largest independent cloud provider full stop and

20:38.380 --> 20:42.260
they make it easy for anyone at any skill level to get started no matter

20:42.260 --> 20:46.300
what technology stack you use Linode can help your ideas come to life if you just

20:46.300 --> 20:51.300
need a personal web server for a blog or a portfolio or maybe your business needs

20:51.300 --> 20:56.340
to scale to serve millions Linode can help you with that and unlike entry

20:56.340 --> 20:59.400
level hosting services that lock you into their platform Linode gives you

20:59.400 --> 21:03.380
full back-end access to customize and control your server to fit your needs

21:03.380 --> 21:08.180
they have a great DNS manager simple to take backups one-click app deployments

21:08.180 --> 21:11.340
and if Kubernetes is your speed to manage your infrastructure Linode has

21:11.340 --> 21:15.140
you covered there you can easily manage your Kubernetes cluster with Linode's

21:15.140 --> 21:19.380
fully managed container orchestration engine also a great way to learn if you

21:19.380 --> 21:22.660
want to learn cybersecurity or practice something before you have to do it in

21:22.660 --> 21:26.740
production Linode has some great options there at great price points but one of

21:26.740 --> 21:30.840
the things that I encourage you to look into is their s3 compatible object

21:30.840 --> 21:34.900
storage if you're not familiar object storage is essentially an easy way for

21:34.900 --> 21:39.100
you to store and access data in the cloud without having to run a front-end

21:39.100 --> 21:42.980
file server it's perfect for data that doesn't change regularly this is where

21:42.980 --> 21:47.340
we use it all the time for show assets that are essentially static and what

21:47.340 --> 21:51.300
something is up in their s3 compatible object storage it's really easy to get a

21:51.300 --> 21:55.340
URL and share that file if you want or maybe even use something like that to

21:55.340 --> 21:59.980
power a static website we use Linode's powerful virtual servers to run our

21:59.980 --> 22:04.060
infrastructure our matrix server our encoding server our new next cloud

22:04.060 --> 22:09.180
server all of its on Linode my personal servers are on Linode Linode started in

22:09.180 --> 22:14.420
2003 as one of the first companies to even get into what is now known as cloud

22:14.420 --> 22:19.260
computing three years before AWS go check it out see what I've been raving

22:19.260 --> 22:22.420
about and support one of our sponsors who's made our transition to

22:22.420 --> 22:27.420
independence possible linode.com slash unplugged thanks to Linode for

22:27.420 --> 22:30.700
sponsoring this show and thanks to everyone who supports our sponsors out

22:30.700 --> 22:38.340
there linode.com slash unplugged okay prepare yourself because we're gonna get

22:38.340 --> 22:44.300
geeky about ZFS because some major milestones have just been reached and I

22:44.300 --> 22:49.140
want to try to understand it all obviously we're ZFS users here but also

22:49.140 --> 22:53.900
as things change and you just it's nice to stay up to date and keep keep current

22:53.900 --> 22:59.300
so it's now called open ZFS 2.0 and I wanted to play a little bit of Matt

22:59.300 --> 23:04.220
Aaron's at giving us a brief state of the union on ZFS and then what I'm gonna

23:04.220 --> 23:08.540
basically do is try to talk Weston explaining all the good new stuff to us

23:08.540 --> 23:12.620
now I'd like to talk a little bit about the overview of the state of the project

23:12.620 --> 23:18.940
so last year I talked quite a bit about what's gonna be coming in open ZFS 2.0

23:18.940 --> 23:25.700
and the big thing is that we we've now combined the source code for open ZFS on

23:25.700 --> 23:30.420
both Linux and FreeBSD and last year I talked about how this is going along

23:30.420 --> 23:34.260
really well it's going to come out in 2020 it is still going to come out in

23:34.260 --> 23:39.260
2020 so this project is very far along we've released three release candidates

23:39.260 --> 23:44.020
so far it's on 2.0 RC 3 right now just came out last week and the final

23:44.020 --> 23:47.700
release will still is still on track to come out before the end of the year

23:47.700 --> 23:52.020
possibly even before the end of the month please don't quote me on that but

23:52.020 --> 23:56.620
that's that's that's what we're aiming for and here's some of the features new

23:56.620 --> 24:02.700
features that you'll see in the next release of open ZFS so this basically is

24:02.700 --> 24:10.180
superseding the zol releases so this is stuff that's new since zol 0.8 and this

24:10.180 --> 24:15.220
is a continuation of that code base but now with support for FreeBSD as well and

24:15.220 --> 24:20.420
most of these a lot of these we've given talks at previous conferences about so

24:20.420 --> 24:23.740
things like you know all this performance work redacted send and

24:23.740 --> 24:28.140
receive in fact we will link you to some of those talks but in addition to the

24:28.140 --> 24:34.340
unified code base for now Linux and FreeBSD it's no longer ZFS on Linux it's

24:34.340 --> 24:39.060
just open ZFS now right Wes yeah isn't that neat I mean from something that

24:39.060 --> 24:43.940
felt like a weird stepchild of the whole ZFS family to now be in the place that

24:43.940 --> 24:48.020
you know a lot of the development effort is actually happening and it's also just

24:48.020 --> 24:52.660
a great example of a wonderful open source project that manages to work with

24:52.660 --> 24:56.980
like pretty much full parity across two very different operating system kernels

24:56.980 --> 25:01.300
but both of them being open source software that's amazing yeah it is and

25:01.300 --> 25:05.540
now they say they're targeting macOS as well so they may have macOS support in

25:05.540 --> 25:11.540
open ZFS 3.0 they've they kind of talked up some of the features the one that

25:11.540 --> 25:14.980
kind of stands out to me and I don't fully grasp why you would need it but

25:14.980 --> 25:21.820
it's L2 arc support so the level 2 arc in ZFS is like this cache right that is

25:21.820 --> 25:25.580
sort of the most frequently used stuff that ZFS keeps in there well it's the

25:25.580 --> 25:29.100
second layer and you've got the arc the adaptive replacement cache and that's

25:29.100 --> 25:31.780
that's for the first you know the nice smart cache to handle stuff that you

25:31.780 --> 25:35.060
don't really need to go fetch off disk again just keep that hot and fresh in

25:35.060 --> 25:39.700
RAM and ZFS does a great job of managing that but if you just you know grams too

25:39.700 --> 25:43.300
expensive you'd only have a certain amount you want more cache for stuff

25:43.300 --> 25:48.260
that's not quite as as well used but in the next layer of used you can have a

25:48.260 --> 25:51.940
faster disk say right you've got like a big pool of old-fashioned spinning rust

25:51.940 --> 25:56.500
then you've got like a nice shiny NVMe that you can use as a cache for after

25:56.500 --> 26:02.340
RAM that's the L2 arc well this new feature is known as the persistent L2

26:02.340 --> 26:05.340
arc and this just basically saves you time let's say you know you had to

26:05.340 --> 26:08.980
reboot your system you did some updates or you just something happened there's

26:08.980 --> 26:13.460
a fault there's kernel panic whatever most of the time with the existing

26:13.460 --> 26:17.220
implementation of the L2 arc well you have to go rebuild that cache so you

26:17.220 --> 26:20.620
won't get the advantages of having a good cache until you've actually done

26:20.620 --> 26:23.260
gone through you've had your service up and running stuff's actually looking at

26:23.260 --> 26:26.500
stuff from the disk trying to pull it but if your workload doesn't change

26:26.500 --> 26:31.100
that's just wasted time rebuilding basically the same or a similar version

26:31.100 --> 26:35.660
of the cache with persistent L2 arc that's just gonna get loaded back up and

26:35.660 --> 26:40.100
you don't have you can skip that time ah that's handy there's a couple of things

26:40.100 --> 26:45.260
in here that make it seem like just using ZFS overall is gonna be quicker

26:45.260 --> 26:51.280
amongst just general performance fixes there's also a new compression standard

26:51.280 --> 26:55.780
Z standard Z standard it's a modern high performance general compression

26:55.780 --> 26:59.300
algorithm which should give better compression levels really similar to the

26:59.300 --> 27:03.660
GZIP but with much better performance and it's also got a big selection of

27:03.660 --> 27:06.120
different compression levels so depending on what your data is what your

27:06.120 --> 27:09.920
trade-offs that you want to make you can choose and configure that I think it's

27:09.920 --> 27:13.340
also neat because it's just a cool open source project that was invented at

27:13.340 --> 27:17.540
Facebook back in like 2016 then the Linux kernel got it and it's been an

27:17.540 --> 27:22.160
available compression option over in butter fs for a while now and then free

27:22.160 --> 27:27.300
BSD got it originally to compress core dumps thanks to our friend Alan Jude

27:27.300 --> 27:31.620
who also made a proof of concept over there for using it for ZFS that's

27:31.620 --> 27:36.620
finally now been integrated how neat is that welcome to BSD unplugged your

27:36.620 --> 27:40.900
weekly BSD talk show that's too busy getting actual work done to care about

27:40.900 --> 27:44.780
what your silly display server my name is Alan love you Alan yeah that's great

27:44.780 --> 27:49.780
that is really cool to see that get in there tons of stuff like we could do a

27:49.780 --> 27:54.660
show that'd be way too long about all of the stuff that's in 2.0 so we will link

27:54.660 --> 27:59.420
to some of the details and of course as always Michael Arbol over there crushing

27:59.420 --> 28:02.700
it with the deets he's got an article that summarizes some of it as well and

28:02.700 --> 28:08.540
it's cool to see this stuff landing I do wonder if we're really gonna see any

28:08.540 --> 28:13.380
movement on what distros adopted or not I doubt it but if you have means of

28:13.380 --> 28:17.140
accessing it it's gonna be a nice little upgrade get yourself prepared for

28:17.140 --> 28:22.420
another round of DKMS rebuild exactly let's something we should probably do

28:22.420 --> 28:27.220
kind of soon too well maybe next episode we should do an art server update but we

28:27.220 --> 28:33.060
need to look into the future with with GNOME and there's a major feature

28:33.060 --> 28:36.420
announcement for GNOME 40 remember that's what they're going to next is

28:36.420 --> 28:41.500
version 40 and mutter is moving that's the back end display compositor is

28:41.500 --> 28:49.940
moving input work to its own dedicated thread a separate get ready for this

28:49.940 --> 28:57.140
Wes a separate CPU thread for the input this long in development effort led

28:57.140 --> 29:02.300
by red hat aimed at restructuring mutter that's I mean it's just good right you

29:02.300 --> 29:06.080
don't want the input work handled on the same thread if you don't have to and now

29:06.080 --> 29:10.140
the import work will be able to be moved over to a separate CPU thread and it's

29:10.140 --> 29:14.340
finally at a state where it was merged into git I think it's been developed

29:14.340 --> 29:18.100
it's been played with but I mean this is a fairly big architectural change right

29:18.100 --> 29:24.060
the merge request had been open for the past three months but was merged on

29:24.060 --> 29:31.380
Friday this is massive this input should the input thread should allow for

29:31.380 --> 29:36.300
avoiding possible cursor jumpiness and situations where your pointer kind of

29:36.300 --> 29:40.140
lurches across the screen it should deal with high-frequency input devices a lot

29:40.140 --> 29:44.420
better it should make sure that no lib input events are missed not to mention

29:44.420 --> 29:50.900
it's just a superior way to architect a workstation desktop and recently on the

29:50.900 --> 29:56.940
show I've talked about how much I've really been enjoying desktop you really

29:56.940 --> 30:00.620
have a little gnome Renaissance over there it was like I came back home for

30:00.620 --> 30:07.700
the holidays and my room was still there and it was like oh I love this I love

30:07.700 --> 30:11.620
this and it was great and I got I got the green bean casserole just the way I

30:11.620 --> 30:15.340
like it when I came down for breakfast it was just like being home again the

30:15.340 --> 30:21.900
the thing is like being at home it eventually all comes crashing back down

30:21.900 --> 30:26.740
and you remember why you moved out as early as possible and why you only go

30:26.740 --> 30:32.660
back for the holidays Wes you saw a little bit of it because was it Sunday I

30:32.660 --> 30:36.900
was you showed up and I was stuck upstairs in my office for like an extra

30:36.900 --> 30:40.620
15 minutes before I could come down and say hi to you at the studio because I

30:40.620 --> 30:46.500
was just dealing with my computer being slow and input lagging because I was

30:46.500 --> 30:52.380
editing god forbid a two and a half hour video file and I was cutting audio from

30:52.380 --> 30:57.060
it for the shows and I was getting I was extracting audio segments and having a

30:57.060 --> 31:00.380
large file and working with an application that is trying to display a

31:00.380 --> 31:05.020
very large waveform and move about and then have to have some other

31:05.020 --> 31:09.860
applications in the background that are transcoding maybe wave files to flack I

31:09.860 --> 31:13.620
mean this is you know it's it this is a system that I've built that has 12

31:13.620 --> 31:21.580
overall addressable threads and I have a dedicated rate 0 14 terabyte scratch

31:21.580 --> 31:28.220
array that I use for any files that I'm working on editing my OS is on a

31:28.220 --> 31:36.540
dedicated MVME disk that's where my root is and then my home partition is on a

31:36.540 --> 31:43.580
dedicated fancy fast Intel two and a half SATA disk and I have every I have

31:43.580 --> 31:49.060
it all split out like that plus I have 32 gigs of RAM so I mean it's not like

31:49.060 --> 31:52.740
I'm doing and I'm just cutting audio from a video file it's opened up in an

31:52.740 --> 31:56.780
audio editor but the whole interface just when I'm doing a task that for me

31:56.780 --> 32:04.380
is a really standard occurrence the UI becomes unresponsive like right-clicking

32:04.380 --> 32:09.900
on say like an icon it has a delay and when you're moving windows around they

32:09.900 --> 32:14.380
get kind of leggy and they kind of stutter around a little bit and when

32:14.380 --> 32:18.220
you're trying to move really quick and it's something that maybe you do every

32:18.220 --> 32:22.980
day and so you're really fast at this task and when you're really fast at

32:22.980 --> 32:26.660
something and you're waiting for your computer like even if you have like this

32:26.660 --> 32:30.420
experience at work if you have something you do for work kind of repeatedly and

32:30.420 --> 32:34.500
you really can just blast through it faster than anybody you know and then

32:34.500 --> 32:37.740
you're you're waiting for your computer at each stage for every time you alt tab

32:37.740 --> 32:40.860
and every time you click on a menu and every time you try to bring up files and

32:40.860 --> 32:46.500
when you drag and drop and it just becomes so aggravating and you think to

32:46.500 --> 32:52.260
yourself what more can I do I've got a modern high-end AMD GPU I've split up my

32:52.260 --> 32:57.220
disk workloads as much as possible I've got tons of RAM I'm only using six gigs

32:57.220 --> 33:03.300
of it I've got 12 addressable CPU cores it's a desktop plugged into Ethernet

33:03.300 --> 33:09.940
like what more can I do to let my computer work it so I can work as to

33:09.940 --> 33:14.620
the my computer lets me work as fast as effective as possible why are you so

33:14.620 --> 33:18.420
slow and so you know I came downstairs like I just don't know I'm gonna do yes

33:18.420 --> 33:21.540
it's just like it's really aggravating because this is I do this kind of all

33:21.540 --> 33:24.700
the time and I was I was having to talk about it because I've really been

33:24.700 --> 33:28.980
annoying enjoying gnomeshell but I find this very annoying so I was asking you

33:28.980 --> 33:32.620
what would you do what should I do what distro should I do and that's that's

33:32.620 --> 33:36.820
kind of how we got to Endeavor OS but we'll save that for the analysis but I

33:36.820 --> 33:43.820
ultimately I decided to go back to the plasma desktop because I just don't

33:43.820 --> 33:48.060
experience this particular kind of frustration there are other paper cuts

33:48.060 --> 33:52.700
but not that paper cut right you you know you win some you lose some but

33:52.700 --> 33:58.700
especially for you who are on a high-end machine with real workflow needs it's

33:58.700 --> 34:03.620
sort of like that the existing state of genome and not all of it was necessarily

34:03.620 --> 34:07.700
built for the way that you're trying to operate and I kind of enjoy with my

34:07.700 --> 34:11.940
monitor setup I enjoy the window rules where things always open up in the same

34:11.940 --> 34:16.940
spot when I launched them I like that consistency for my kind of setup yes so

34:16.940 --> 34:20.540
that's that was nice it was like it honestly to complete the metaphor it was

34:20.540 --> 34:23.780
like when after you're done visiting family and you get back to your own

34:23.780 --> 34:29.740
place and you're like oh yeah I way more prefer this it doesn't look as good I

34:29.740 --> 34:33.620
didn't decorate as nicely but all my things are here and I know what food is

34:33.620 --> 34:37.300
in the fridge yeah exactly that's so much what that's so much what the

34:37.300 --> 34:40.220
experience was like and I didn't I thought the I thought it'd feel like a

34:40.220 --> 34:45.220
big compromise but I was like oh no this is actually home and so I have so much

34:45.220 --> 34:49.380
respect for what both desktop teams are doing because there's things I just love

34:49.380 --> 34:54.100
about all of them but to see this kind of move for gnome 40 where they're gonna

34:54.100 --> 34:59.660
start to break this stuff off that's that's huge because that may end up

34:59.660 --> 35:04.020
ultimately being the best of both worlds for me and no one had to get assimilated

35:04.020 --> 35:08.740
so big things look like they're in the works for gnome 40 they've also

35:08.740 --> 35:16.380
officially announced gnome circle which is kind of a way to include I guess more

35:16.380 --> 35:21.700
people in the gnome clubhouse you don't necessarily in the past if you wanted to

35:21.700 --> 35:26.340
be part of the gnome project your projects needed to be hosted on gnome

35:26.340 --> 35:31.900
infrastructure and you had to follow their rules but gnome circle aims to

35:31.900 --> 35:36.420
sort of change that yeah now to become members projects must simply be

35:36.420 --> 35:41.020
open-source software and use the gnome platform both applications and

35:41.020 --> 35:45.020
development libraries can apply and projects don't need to be hosted on

35:45.020 --> 35:50.600
gnome infrastructure nor do they need to follow gnomes release schedule now what

35:50.600 --> 35:53.980
do you get when you'll be eligible for a range of benefits including promotion

35:53.980 --> 35:57.940
gnome foundation membership and that gives access to things like travel and

35:57.940 --> 36:02.540
marketing funding services including an at gnome org email address blog hosting

36:02.540 --> 36:06.300
video conferencing and hey I'm gonna next cloud account so you actually get

36:06.300 --> 36:10.300
to be part of the family but you don't have to play by all of the rules yeah I

36:10.300 --> 36:14.260
might mean we get to see a bunch of cool desktop applications and whatnot start

36:14.260 --> 36:18.060
showing up that are maybe a little more independent but sort of follow that

36:18.060 --> 36:22.140
desktop ethos so they look really good as a part of your desktop I think that

36:22.140 --> 36:28.820
could be a really lovely development just a little bit of cleaning just a

36:28.820 --> 36:32.020
little bit here and there every now and then it's always worth mentioning you

36:32.020 --> 36:38.460
should join the luck plug our virtual lug has a whole other event outside the

36:38.460 --> 36:44.240
show on Sundays and they do that at noon Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern in the lobby we

36:44.240 --> 36:48.620
have our mumble info on our website and it's kind of it's perfect because if we

36:48.620 --> 36:52.160
ever have a backup time where we need to record the show that's when we do it

36:52.160 --> 36:55.860
because we know there's people in there and so there's other reasons it's kind

36:55.860 --> 36:58.500
of fun you know it's a great place to hang out and chat with people but can

36:58.500 --> 37:03.220
also maybe every now and then catch a live show and I'll also give a mention

37:03.220 --> 37:08.740
to the all shows feed if you're subscribed to that you'll know that

37:08.740 --> 37:13.540
Linux action news has recently been revamped with mr. West pain joining the

37:13.540 --> 37:17.380
team and I'm really loving where we're going with it and if you're if you're

37:17.380 --> 37:22.420
only listening to this show you're only getting half the story there is a whole

37:22.420 --> 37:25.140
other set of stories that we cover in Linux action news and that's the stuff

37:25.140 --> 37:29.540
that kind of dense the open source universe every week particularly great

37:29.540 --> 37:34.220
if you want to be or are in the industry and you want to stay current on stuff

37:34.220 --> 37:38.900
that has wider ramifications to Linux action news has got you covered so check

37:38.900 --> 37:43.900
that out if you're not already linuxactionnews.com and that my friends

37:43.900 --> 37:49.980
is all the tidying we need to do today so it's time for an endeavor OS check

37:49.980 --> 37:54.180
and something I promised when they first announced and we took a look at it and I

37:54.180 --> 38:00.060
sort of judged it as need some time to cook but we should come back to it and

38:00.060 --> 38:04.980
that was a little bit ago and here we are they have a new release in the works

38:04.980 --> 38:08.060
right now they just put one out in September and then of course because

38:08.060 --> 38:12.780
it's based on arch you can get up-to-date in between pretty quickly so

38:12.780 --> 38:22.220
endeavor OS has found itself a comfortable niche in the distro world

38:22.220 --> 38:27.100
because God knows there's a plenty of Linux distros out there and you really

38:27.100 --> 38:29.860
kind of have to wonder what makes different distro stand out from each

38:29.860 --> 38:35.420
other especially when you have mangero which is clearly filling a big need for

38:35.420 --> 38:40.020
people who want a productized arch right there's already arch with an installer

38:40.020 --> 38:44.380
in several different forms so like what do we get in here yeah and a big

38:44.380 --> 38:50.380
community too right so I think and it's it was evident when they launched but I

38:50.380 --> 38:54.940
think as time has gone on they have refined their position in the market

38:54.940 --> 39:01.220
with a maybe more clever pitch they very much are not focusing or even pushing a

39:01.220 --> 39:06.100
desktop or even branding they say on their website endeavor OS is mainly a

39:06.100 --> 39:10.420
terminal centric distro with some gooey tools out of the box like our welcome

39:10.420 --> 39:15.500
app reflector auto and a kernel tool to make jump-starting easier and with these

39:15.500 --> 39:18.860
tools and the power of the terminal we offer you the opportunity to give you

39:18.860 --> 39:22.380
full control from the start in creating a system that suits your idea in

39:22.380 --> 39:27.820
computing they even kind of list no branding as a feature so wrap your head

39:27.820 --> 39:31.700
around that because that's got to be as a distro that's that's got to be a hard

39:31.700 --> 39:35.540
choice you're gonna you're gonna remove your wallpaper you're gonna remove your

39:35.540 --> 39:40.460
branding if the user chooses well then how are they gonna remember are they

39:40.460 --> 39:46.300
gonna know but they offer that if you use their online installer you get a

39:46.300 --> 39:50.500
choice of desktop environment but they really seem to be refining their pitch

39:50.500 --> 39:55.840
as as close to arch as possible they say on their website and I love this with

39:55.840 --> 40:02.420
the exception of our in-house developed reflector auto the welcome screen and a

40:02.420 --> 40:07.820
kernel manager and the update notifier all of the packages are installed

40:07.820 --> 40:12.780
directly from the arch repos or from the AUR they are not customized or modified

40:12.780 --> 40:17.020
they're not coming from our own repo we want to stay as close to arch as

40:17.020 --> 40:21.540
possible and so that's I think where they're trying to position themselves is

40:21.540 --> 40:28.260
a Kickstarter to get into just a long term arch setup for the desktop does

40:28.260 --> 40:33.660
that appeal to you you know it kind of does at least you know I don't know if

40:33.660 --> 40:38.660
it's necessarily what I would choose to use to set up my next arch system which

40:38.660 --> 40:43.820
by the way I do think my next system will be an arch system again but I'm

40:43.820 --> 40:47.400
glad this exists because if I'm going to be working on a system if I'm gonna

40:47.400 --> 40:52.180
advise other folks to do this I just don't know that many folks who've been

40:52.180 --> 40:54.740
down the road of setting up an arch system have gone through all the

40:54.740 --> 40:58.780
installs have done that and who really just like doing it all the time I kind

40:58.780 --> 41:02.260
of do for me that's it's like a rite of passage it's a way you sort of get

41:02.260 --> 41:05.700
familiar it's almost like you're paying the upfront cost to really understand

41:05.700 --> 41:09.660
and feel connected to your system that I really like about running arch but I

41:09.660 --> 41:13.620
also get that for many you just want the you know the easy maintenance the

41:13.620 --> 41:18.660
simplicity and the great access to packages and for that use case this

41:18.660 --> 41:22.860
seems perfect and they never have to install it again if you don't screw it

41:22.860 --> 41:26.940
up you know that's that's super appealing to me some of my longest

41:26.940 --> 41:30.460
installs have turned out to be arch boxes and I know this people listening

41:30.460 --> 41:33.980
there oh arts are talking about ours you can roll your eyes I kind of I think you

41:33.980 --> 41:39.460
should try to put that aside if I could be so direct and and consider that

41:39.460 --> 41:43.300
there's obviously something that's appealing to a certain market because on

41:43.300 --> 41:46.540
top of whatever everything that West just touched on I have to be honest with

41:46.540 --> 41:50.100
you I think just because I've been around for a long time I don't think

41:50.100 --> 41:55.380
this would impact new users to the desktop but I find it a big relief to

41:55.380 --> 42:01.300
not think about if I'm installing a flat pack a snap a deb or an rpm it's such a

42:01.300 --> 42:08.100
relief just to say yay that's the that's the helper I use yay dash s slack or

42:08.100 --> 42:14.020
telegram and I'm not doing the overhead of what do I want a flat pack of this if

42:14.020 --> 42:16.580
it's a snap and it's confined am I gonna have some issues because I do

42:16.580 --> 42:21.860
attachments with this app it's just a binary it's gonna be as fast as possible

42:21.860 --> 42:26.980
because there is there's no there's no like structure around it it's just a

42:26.980 --> 42:32.020
binary on my computer and it's gonna get updated really quickly sometimes as soon

42:32.020 --> 42:36.500
as the git repo has been updated and I'll only have to run one command ever

42:36.500 --> 42:40.740
do that ever like what I was doing on pop which I got down pretty well I was I

42:40.740 --> 42:45.300
would have to do apt updates and then I would have to do flat pack updates and

42:45.300 --> 42:48.340
then I would you know and I have to do both of them I just got down and snap

42:48.340 --> 42:52.860
just takes care of itself but I just as a longtime user I guess I guess I

42:52.860 --> 42:59.420
haven't really liked that overhead that the that I take when I even on fedora

42:59.420 --> 43:03.900
it's like I'm always kind of wondering what's the downside of having my video

43:03.900 --> 43:06.700
player as a flat pack is there a downside to that does that mean it's

43:06.700 --> 43:09.580
gonna does that does that mean there's gonna be any difference in where it can

43:09.580 --> 43:12.940
get to on the file system or access to what video decoding you can do like I

43:12.940 --> 43:17.700
just have to do that math and it's exhausting and I don't have that with an

43:17.700 --> 43:22.700
arch based distro and so what endeavor OS is done here is they've said hey we

43:22.700 --> 43:26.380
get that you want arch but you also don't have a lot of time you don't want

43:26.380 --> 43:30.620
to be worried about who's maintaining these packages what the delay is you

43:30.620 --> 43:34.040
just want if it's an arch you want it but you don't want to bother with the

43:34.040 --> 43:37.900
whole setup process it's an interesting kind of middle of the road too because

43:37.900 --> 43:41.740
it's not it's clearly not aimed necessarily at you know like brand new

43:41.740 --> 43:46.340
users folks you don't who aren't prepared for arch it's terminal centric

43:46.340 --> 43:50.060
distro right but at the same time they have a lot of nice little utilities like

43:50.060 --> 43:54.020
in there in their welcome utility that sort of get you going explain some stuff

43:54.020 --> 43:57.700
helps you out with helpful tools helps you know some guides to like well here's

43:57.700 --> 44:01.820
how you start installing stuff from the AUR so it's it's an interesting sweet

44:01.820 --> 44:05.220
spot of yeah you want to use this computer but we're still gonna cut you

44:05.220 --> 44:09.660
some slack we've got some docs we've got a wiki we've got a forum got all the

44:09.660 --> 44:12.740
usual structure it's like you do need some help well there's folks around and

44:12.740 --> 44:17.500
there's some docs for that too they have applied their customization at just the

44:17.500 --> 44:23.620
right points so a live session starts with their welcome app it's an XFCE based

44:23.620 --> 44:29.180
desktop which in general the any GTK desktop is just a mess about where it

44:29.180 --> 44:33.380
puts the windows across my three screens but this one was particular hilarious

44:33.380 --> 44:36.700
like it would just be random what screens different dialog boxes would

44:36.700 --> 44:39.540
pop on and what orientation they would be in but once I got everything

44:39.540 --> 44:43.340
centralized on one screen I noticed that they have a tool right there they're

44:43.340 --> 44:48.620
the reflector auto tool reflector is a tool in arch that goes out and helps you

44:48.620 --> 44:53.420
find the fastest mirrors and update your mirror list well they just have like a

44:53.420 --> 44:58.660
one-button click to do that they ask you a couple of questions and then it gives

44:58.660 --> 45:03.620
you a super fresh fast set of mirrors and that's really nice because that's

45:03.620 --> 45:06.820
something I do when I'm setting up an arch box already then they have an

45:06.820 --> 45:09.440
update this app button so that way you know you have the latest version of the

45:09.440 --> 45:13.660
welcome app and presumably the installer and then I like that they have an

45:13.660 --> 45:19.020
offline mode and an online mode to install offline mode just gives you like

45:19.020 --> 45:23.220
a their XFCE desktop environment with the packages that are released on that

45:23.220 --> 45:27.140
ISO and it's a good-looking it is you know actually that's what that's what I

45:27.140 --> 45:30.100
went I figured that's what I'd try and I stuck with it because it's a it's a

45:30.100 --> 45:35.340
sharp XFCE enough that took me a few minutes of having to go poke around to

45:35.340 --> 45:39.100
figure out oh yeah this is XFCE the first time I booted it up that is

45:39.100 --> 45:43.300
legitimately the benchmark when you know they've got XFCE right is when you

45:43.300 --> 45:46.540
can't tell it first because it just looks like a modern desktop and that's

45:46.540 --> 45:50.820
slick and you could really see the appeal to that or so that's the offline

45:50.820 --> 45:54.300
mode or if you use and that's nice to have I should say I'm all over the place

45:54.300 --> 45:58.180
I'm very excited about this but offline mode super nice to have really

45:58.180 --> 46:00.940
appreciate that that's an option and they kind of have a little bit more

46:00.940 --> 46:06.540
experimental online method which lets you select a desktop environment at the

46:06.540 --> 46:10.500
time of install and pulls down the latest versions of everything from the

46:10.500 --> 46:14.700
arch repo and again that's where having that reflector tool comes in handy

46:14.700 --> 46:19.100
because that means as you install it's gonna be the fastest package

46:19.100 --> 46:24.140
installation transfers as possible and I think these features and even the

46:24.140 --> 46:29.740
process are just clearly more appealing to experienced Linux users who've

46:29.740 --> 46:33.780
probably been through this rigamarole before they understand that like using a

46:33.780 --> 46:36.980
fastest mirror for example means your system will install faster like that

46:36.980 --> 46:40.640
could be as an example of the type of user that understands that difference

46:40.640 --> 46:46.040
it's kind of the type of user this is targeted at and I think endeavor OS is

46:46.040 --> 46:51.380
nailing that it's for people who like to mess with computers it's for people who

46:51.380 --> 46:57.660
like to mess with computers and you know who you are and it it's not better it's

46:57.660 --> 47:02.140
not like the superior distro it's just another option it's it's a set of

47:02.140 --> 47:06.260
features that are appealing to my uses of Linux like I mentioned with

47:06.260 --> 47:11.080
everything Wes and I talked about plus these options right at install the ones

47:11.080 --> 47:14.620
you're done are just kind of out of your way but having these these choices of a

47:14.620 --> 47:20.140
custom partitioner that is actually surprisingly customizable it recognized

47:20.140 --> 47:26.260
my LVM raid and even even recognized like the the disk that is the is the

47:26.260 --> 47:30.900
output of that and all of it and let me manage all of it in a way that is

47:30.900 --> 47:34.300
possible in most distros but some distros don't even make it don't even

47:34.300 --> 47:38.340
make that approachable and it's not like because endeavor OS has all these things

47:38.340 --> 47:43.140
Ubuntu or Fedora are bad it's they're just different it's a matter of personal

47:43.140 --> 47:47.380
preference but I think I'm the kind of user that prefers to have access to

47:47.380 --> 47:51.260
these kind of more power user style features at the beginning of install and

47:51.260 --> 47:56.180
I you know I went through there on my main workstation which I originally

47:56.180 --> 47:59.580
wasn't gonna install this on but then I really started to enjoy it and it was

47:59.580 --> 48:04.020
fantastic to just choose this disk layout that I mentioned earlier and and

48:04.020 --> 48:10.620
be able to visually see it and lock it in and reboot my box and it just it was

48:10.620 --> 48:14.740
all there it's a very basic plain install but it's all there I mean I think

48:14.740 --> 48:18.380
if you were gonna set this up by hand in the regular archway I'm not sure you

48:18.380 --> 48:22.980
would have been done by the showtime no no I did it this morning not planned I

48:22.980 --> 48:27.500
was just gonna just keep on keeping but I thought you know I was really enjoying

48:27.500 --> 48:32.800
it so I was like let's see if I can get this done this morning and I chose

48:32.800 --> 48:38.380
plasma as my desktop environment again and it's going pretty smooth so far I

48:38.380 --> 48:43.300
really like it it's it's there's something else I find kind of appealing

48:43.300 --> 48:48.180
about and I don't know if this is gonna be a factor but I'm trying I'm trying to

48:48.180 --> 48:52.980
be open-minded when I get my new laptop whenever that happens I want to put an

48:52.980 --> 48:55.580
OS on there that I'm really gonna stick with for a while I want to put a distro

48:55.580 --> 48:58.380
on there and I know myself I know that sometimes when I get like kind of

48:58.380 --> 49:03.340
stressed out I can I can kind of start to distro hop as a way to quote-unquote

49:03.340 --> 49:07.580
problem-solve with immediate results where maybe I'm struggling with

49:07.580 --> 49:10.860
something that takes a long time to resolve and it's frustrating so I want

49:10.860 --> 49:14.020
something I can make a change to immediately and see some immediate

49:14.020 --> 49:17.180
benefit and sometimes that's why I think I distro hop so I have to be aware of

49:17.180 --> 49:21.160
all of these aspects it's it's a complicated psychological thing for me

49:21.160 --> 49:27.060
with you know it's hard to pick a distro these days well it is and you know

49:27.060 --> 49:31.100
you're gonna leave it running for a while forever at least with you but it's

49:31.100 --> 49:33.780
gonna stick around you want it you want to make the right choice and you don't

49:33.780 --> 49:38.620
want to regret that later when everything's broken and on fire I got in

49:38.620 --> 49:43.220
my head too I started thinking if I say it was on air and I ran Ubuntu all the

49:43.220 --> 49:47.180
time and I talked about how I always run Ubuntu or what I noticed when I talk

49:47.180 --> 49:51.740
about how I use pop OS people think like oh he's so in the bag for Ubuntu or

49:51.740 --> 49:55.780
he's running pop OS because system 76 paid him to do it or if I run Fedora

49:55.780 --> 50:00.420
it's like oh he must he must be a big fan of Red Hat and I worry that like the

50:00.420 --> 50:05.700
distro I choose to run like sends a signal in a way just because of being on

50:05.700 --> 50:12.900
the show and while arch sort of sends a like oh by the way use arch it doesn't

50:12.900 --> 50:18.140
signal any kind of corporate allegiance it's sort of like neutral territory much

50:18.140 --> 50:23.340
like Debian is and so in a way it kind of feels like that in the back of my

50:23.340 --> 50:27.220
mind is playing a role in the distro I may choose to going forward is just

50:27.220 --> 50:31.580
simply I know arch I can make it work for me I'm very happy with it and it

50:31.580 --> 50:38.220
essentially means I'm I'm neutral yeah you know I I don't I don't have some

50:38.220 --> 50:41.540
sort of perceived bias because I use pop OS or because I mean right because I'm

50:41.540 --> 50:45.980
running on Fedora we all know you're in the pocket of the Linux foundation

50:45.980 --> 50:52.420
anyway yeah I'm getting that big foundation money for sure I don't know

50:52.420 --> 50:55.100
maybe that's just maybe I'm just up in my head about it but it's been on my

50:55.100 --> 51:00.260
mind too as I go through this and I kind of like that I don't really I know that

51:00.260 --> 51:03.420
over the years there's been drama with arch here and there but I can't really

51:03.420 --> 51:07.180
articulate anything at the moment but mostly not right I mean you don't you

51:07.180 --> 51:10.660
just don't expect the next big thing the back next big tumult that we'll end up

51:10.660 --> 51:14.540
talking about here on the show if you're running arch it probably won't be about

51:14.540 --> 51:17.740
your distro might be about some software you're running but then you'll

51:17.740 --> 51:21.220
just be running the upstream stuff anyway I do like them fresh packages

51:21.220 --> 51:25.540
that's the it's like if I was gonna go if I was gonna go gnome desktop Ubuntu

51:25.540 --> 51:29.300
and Fedora I'm much more appealing because you get that fresh gnome shell

51:29.300 --> 51:33.700
sauce right when it's pretty much as soon as possible like arches it takes

51:33.700 --> 51:37.820
even longer to get an arch than it does in Fedora Ubuntu you know but yeah I

51:37.820 --> 51:40.700
looked at it and I thought you know it's very it's a you tilt it's a

51:40.700 --> 51:45.340
utilitarian move for me much like plasma is a very utilitarian desktop for me and

51:45.340 --> 51:49.000
I think the two things might work well together and I think endeavor OS could

51:49.000 --> 51:54.180
be the way I got there and I kind of love it because anti gross was my

51:54.180 --> 51:58.700
solution in the past for some machines but it felt like too much where I do not

51:58.700 --> 52:02.140
get that sense with endeavor OS it really feels like it's pretty much there

52:02.140 --> 52:05.860
to help me get it rolling and then they're out and it's peace out have a

52:05.860 --> 52:09.020
good time enjoy your arch box yeah that's not too much and it felt like

52:09.020 --> 52:13.180
like with the with the little reflector helper it was kind of just of an enough

52:13.180 --> 52:16.340
of a gooey for me like I can do it I know how to edit this in the command

52:16.340 --> 52:19.620
file but scrolling through to find just the countries I want or you know

52:19.620 --> 52:23.980
whatever else it's just really nice to have a quick gooey I could click it had

52:23.980 --> 52:26.780
already figured out that I just wanted you know servers in the United States

52:26.780 --> 52:32.620
had HTTPS already selected boom I also when I was in the forum and Frank was

52:32.620 --> 52:36.540
just reminded me Frank it sounds like one of the founders of endeavor OS has

52:36.540 --> 52:40.220
been having some medical problems recently yeah Brian is really a very

52:40.220 --> 52:43.980
nice guy and he's been having a few medical issues but I really think you

52:43.980 --> 52:49.140
should get him on he is a wonderful person to talk to and is really focused

52:49.140 --> 52:54.380
on his community and that forum that you were talking about they are really

52:54.380 --> 52:57.900
helpful that's a really nice thing to hear I don't think I've had enough

52:57.900 --> 53:02.540
exposure yet to really make a call but it's good to get that feedback yeah I

53:02.540 --> 53:06.580
we will try to track him down or Brian if you're listening reach out to me on

53:06.580 --> 53:10.820
telegram or Twitter I'm Chris lass or Chris at Jupiter broadcasting comm I

53:10.820 --> 53:14.980
would love to chat and I hope he gets better I saw that news and it's really

53:14.980 --> 53:20.780
sad because it's such a great solid distro so my best goes out to him so I

53:20.780 --> 53:26.500
really like it West would it be stupid nuts ridiculous to put this on the new

53:26.500 --> 53:31.700
studio hardware would it be crazy I mean Ubuntu has served us so well that the

53:31.700 --> 53:35.220
only reason I would want to replace it would just simply be for consistency

53:35.220 --> 53:38.260
whoo now you're getting exciting I thought you're gonna say reinstall it on

53:38.260 --> 53:42.060
our server in the garage but okay okay we'll start with the studio hardware

53:42.060 --> 53:47.900
well no the server is already arch it sure is you know if if we get jack maybe

53:47.900 --> 53:51.860
pipeline you're going I think we I think it could work I think it could work well

53:51.860 --> 53:55.500
test box yeah but we need a text box we should probably run the test box for a

53:55.500 --> 53:59.580
little while go through a couple update cycles and figure out this is gonna work

53:59.580 --> 54:03.060
for what we need yeah I think we're gonna stick with it it's just we are

54:03.060 --> 54:07.260
getting to a point where we really have to we you know we we were we were very

54:07.260 --> 54:10.180
generously sent some hardware so we have to run that through some validation

54:10.180 --> 54:13.260
testing and we have some machines we have to replace its maintenance season

54:13.260 --> 54:16.780
in the studio very much so funny how that always seems to happen around the

54:16.780 --> 54:19.940
holidays and I don't think we're gonna put 1804 on there which is what some of

54:19.940 --> 54:24.060
them have now so where do we go next this is a serious perpetual problem I

54:24.060 --> 54:28.140
have but I enjoy I think at the same time we'll figure it out we'll figure it

54:28.140 --> 54:32.460
out maybe folks should write in and let us know you know if we should if we

54:32.460 --> 54:35.300
should go down this dark road yeah I'd actually be curious to know what their

54:35.300 --> 54:38.740
studio production experiences are what are you doing audio on out there

54:38.740 --> 54:46.620
listeners in the world Linux unplug calm contact oh it's Black Friday season and

54:46.620 --> 54:50.940

a link in the show notes for a cloud gurus Black Friday sale now you went out

55:33.740 --> 55:41.020
and did some email spelunking and we have a couple in the mail bag and I'll

55:41.020 --> 55:45.580
take the first one West why don't you take the second one Zach writes in says

55:45.580 --> 55:51.260
while visiting the Linode site I typed in Linode comm slash Linux and I found a

55:51.260 --> 55:55.660
pleasant little Easter egg oh that's why I couldn't get Linux I see I wanted to

55:55.660 --> 56:00.700
get Linode comm slash Linux I was wondering we have slash unplugged he

56:00.700 --> 56:03.900
said if you visit the site of this address you'll get a smile for sure

56:03.900 --> 56:08.780
warmly Zach oh that's great well thanks for letting me know Zach I when they

56:08.780 --> 56:12.780
said it was taken I was like oh okay I just assumed some other like podcast

56:12.780 --> 56:16.700
had gotten it but I guess that's that's what it was all right West fire well we

56:16.700 --> 56:20.500
were just talking about Black Friday and Mark wrote in with a little bit of

56:20.500 --> 56:23.340
confusion no Black Friday deal for cork and

56:23.340 --> 56:27.620
contributor I'm altruistic but cheap as well so I thought maybe you could have

56:27.620 --> 56:31.860
you could just clarify that for us Chris I thought I did do one I thought it yeah

56:31.860 --> 56:35.740
well there is a coupon code it's Black Friday and it takes two dollars off

56:35.740 --> 56:39.140
crazy Chris is blowing the prices out and if you want to be a core

56:39.140 --> 56:43.780
contributor and you haven't done it yet it helps the show stay independent it

56:43.780 --> 56:48.300
helps us be picky about advertisers you get a limited ad feed there is some ads

56:48.300 --> 56:54.660
in the feed but limited and you also get access to the totally live version that

56:54.660 --> 57:00.620
starts well before we hit record in the some of our best stuff actually is well

57:00.620 --> 57:03.980
before we hit record and well after we stop recording you get the whole live

57:03.980 --> 57:07.820
stream as a possible RSS feed just packaged up and delivered as a podcast

57:07.820 --> 57:13.140
if you would like to do that use the coupon code Black Friday when just as

57:13.140 --> 57:16.500
one word when you become a core contributor and you can find that at

57:16.500 --> 57:22.540
unplugged core calm thank you for thinking of us all right well moving on

57:22.540 --> 57:27.060
I've got another question for you Chris and this one from Harry what are those

57:27.060 --> 57:31.020
RF earbuds that you're using I've heard you made reference to the fact that you

57:31.020 --> 57:36.500
use RF earbuds instead of Bluetooth what are you using and what are you using in

57:36.500 --> 57:40.380
conjunction for your microphone oh man well I so I have some bad news is

57:40.380 --> 57:44.580
they're not earbuds so that's the bad news maybe those are out there if

57:44.580 --> 57:50.060
anybody has any recommendations do send those in but what I have been using is

57:50.060 --> 57:55.220
more like over-the-ear headphones and I was just searching my orders to try to

57:55.220 --> 57:58.580
get the exact model number of them but and I know I have them somewhere in the

57:58.580 --> 58:01.140
show notes you may be able to find them on the website but when I search my

58:01.140 --> 58:06.380
order on Amazon they don't show up they're like Corsair RF headphones that

58:06.380 --> 58:09.860
have a microphone built in that auto mutes when you put the when you put the

58:09.860 --> 58:12.820
mic up and then it unmutes when you put it down which is what I prefer but the

58:12.820 --> 58:17.300
brilliant thing about it and I've had some good success with Bluetooth but the

58:17.300 --> 58:21.900
brilliant thing about the RF headphones is not only is it super reliable and

58:21.900 --> 58:27.640
rock-solid wireless obviously but there's a USB dongle that is an always

58:27.640 --> 58:32.980
on existing sound card even if you have the headphones turned off so you're not

58:32.980 --> 58:36.940
having this problem where the headphones come and go and so your sound device

58:36.940 --> 58:40.100
comes and goes because that that's sometimes like for example maybe chrome

58:40.100 --> 58:43.220
doesn't switch over when you first turn on your Bluetooth headphones because you

58:43.220 --> 58:45.860
have to close and reopen chrome before it'll start sending audio to the new

58:45.860 --> 58:50.580
audio device those kind of annoying little problems hate that so much they

58:50.580 --> 58:54.380
don't come up because the USB dongle is always there it's always acting as your

58:54.380 --> 58:57.960
sound card so it's always your default output device and then you just turn the

58:57.960 --> 59:02.540
headphones on or off when you want system audio which just how I prefer to

59:02.540 --> 59:07.620
work oh you found it thank you yeah they are premium gaming headphones I don't

59:07.620 --> 59:11.100
know about that but they do work just fine with Linux and they are great for

59:11.100 --> 59:15.860
gaming I don't know about premium gaming headphones I guess they do have an RGB

59:15.860 --> 59:20.140
logo on the side that I don't think you can control from Linux so a disclaimer

59:20.140 --> 59:24.420
of course yeah well that's good I'm glad I knew you have been using those and I'm

59:24.420 --> 59:28.300
glad to hear that they're still working well yeah I I pretty much use them every

59:28.300 --> 59:32.020
weekend at least I don't like to use them as much for video conferencing

59:32.020 --> 59:37.460
because they are so big but yeah all right so Bennett writes in about the pro

59:37.460 --> 59:41.660
one X smartphone hi Chris and Wes I was wondering what your thoughts are for the

59:41.660 --> 59:47.420
pro one X smartphone from FX technology and the XDA developers I hadn't heard of

59:47.420 --> 59:51.980
the original pro one and my jaw hit the floor when I saw a physical keyboard and

59:51.980 --> 59:57.060
it ships with Ubuntu touch and lineage OS and the specs well they're pretty good

59:57.060 --> 01:00:02.380
I'm fairly active on XDA I was fairly active and the phone would be perfect

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:06.940
mix between an old Android and my current love for Linux they demolished

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:10.780
their IndieGoGo campaign and it looks like it's gonna ship in March I hope to

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:16.060
hear your thoughts Bennett how did I not hear about this Wes this one was new to

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:19.980
me too I know thank you for hiding in Bennett yeah I I'm really happy to check

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:26.380
it out I actually be kind of down for a I have a I have a very small phone now

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:30.780
which I'm really happy with and I could see room in my heart for a bigger phone

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:35.620
with a keyboard it's that style where you slide it back and up so the screen

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:40.700
kind of pivots up so it kind of is tilted right at you and they say it's a

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:47.980
purposely designed function for Android lineage or Ubuntu touch so that looks

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:52.900
really good and of course it has USB C out and they talk about connecting it to

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:57.580
a larger screen and they have some shots of it with the Ubuntu desktop a

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.780
Bluetooth mouse and keyboard and then it's connected over USB C kind of kind

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:06.380
of one yeah you know this would be pretty nice even if it was just like a

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:10.180
handy little remote terminal machine even if I didn't use it as a full-on

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:14.660
replacement for my regular smartphone just having this in my bag and my back

01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:20.900
pocket and the car I'm interested get this West that has a removable battery I

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:24.740
didn't think they still made those they have three left at their Black Friday

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:30.320
sale price which is down from 829 to 599 too rich for my blood but I think it's a

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:35.300
fair price for what this thing is so they'll probably be sold out out of that

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.740
particular one by the time you're hearing this unless you're listening

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:41.980
live I'm gonna drop it in the IRC right now so if you want it oh you already did

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:46.260
look at you as we're hooking them up but I'll put it in this I'll put the direct

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:51.100
link to the Indiegogo in the show notes if you do want to check it out because

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:54.580
even I mean if you have the money to burn even at full price it looks like

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:58.660
really nice and the fact that they're aiming for multi OS compatibility out of

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:03.780
the box and they have what looks like an actually pretty decent QWERTY keyboard

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:07.860
I'm down with that I think that's a pretty solid recommend recommendations

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:11.940
so thanks for sending that in those are those are solid all right West have

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.380
yourself a taco because it is time for the picks and I mentioned earlier I

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:19.940
wasn't sure about having a video player as a flat pack well I'm gonna recommend

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:26.820
a flat pack that's a video player it's a really great MPV front end for the

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:31.060
plasma desktop yeah yeah of course right I'm always looking West for the best

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:34.740
video player this is gonna replace dragon player for me and it's gotta look

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:38.220
native so that when you full screen that you can easily forget about all those

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:44.100
mismatched window orders of course he's savage yeah it is a cute QML video

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:50.820
player built on top of lib MPV and it's available as a package of course but I

01:02:50.820 --> 01:02:54.260
have a link to the flat pack and I think it's great it reminds me a lot of dragon

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:59.820
player but it's it's current it's maintained and I think MPV is the best

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:04.700
video player for desktop Linux I love me MPV soloid or whatever it was was great

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:11.340
on GTK so this is great for plasma now we do have a second pick you want to

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.180
cover that one yeah this one's interesting we've talked a lot about

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:19.660
YouTube DL lately but maybe you're not interested in moving pictures you just

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:25.500
want regular pictures well enter gallery DL a command-line program to download

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.380
image galleries and collections from several well they say several but turns

01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:34.620
out many image hosting sites I like this so it's like YouTube DL but for

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:37.900
galleries the chat room says I didn't mention the video player names because I

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:43.180
don't really know how it's pronounced Haruna Haruna yeah so Haruna is the video

01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:47.460
player and then gallery DL is the command-line app that downloads image

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:51.500
galleries and collections it doesn't say exactly what right here in the in the

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:56.580
release notes but they do have a page on their github and it's just about every

01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:01.260
damn picture site I've ever seen I could see this being really handy for like

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.580
backgrounds getting wallpapers yes or you know maybe some some you don't want

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.340
to be on a platform anymore you just want to back up a bunch of your old work

01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:11.300
something like that because you know they've got got things for Instagram

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:15.260
they've cut they've got things for all these popular sites like flickr or

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:21.180
various places you might post art on here a lot of other sites as well but

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:26.420
hey that's the sign of a good tool that's right that's right if you'd like

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.220
to give us a suggestion for an app that we should try out maybe talk about in

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:33.580

all right let's name this thing JB titles calm gonna come up with a real

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:33.260
good name right that's the secret to podcast success it's got to be it I

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:38.220
think with the new laptop I'm gonna kind of refresh the home setup I'm gonna try

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:43.220
getting monitor mounts and a laptop mount that goes on the monitor mount so

01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:47.460
I can have screens and my laptop mounted and yeah I'm really gonna I'm gonna put

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.940
some effort into kind of like a 2021 setup so I want to try to get it all

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.100
kind of going and then I think I'm gonna talk about it here on the show talk

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:57.540
about what I did and what didn't work for me I think it's gonna be I think

01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:00.660
it's gonna be a solid kind of at least start for the year I don't know if I'll

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:03.980
stick with the whole setup but I'm kind of I'm kind of aiming for that sounds

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:07.620
like we'll need to play some bets for how long it lasts oh I don't know if I

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:10.860
don't take any of that action with
