WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Did you guys see the Amazon echo?

00:07.920 --> 00:14.420
The Amazon echoes really something and there's been some really really great parodies and I want to play one of my favorite Amazon echo parodies

00:14.420 --> 00:16.420
For you, it's pretty fantastic

00:16.420 --> 00:23.220
What are you doing there? What is it? Is it for me? It's for everyone

00:26.300 --> 00:28.660
Is it on? It's always on

00:31.060 --> 00:38.340
Can it hear me right now? It can hear you from anywhere in the room. I've put wrapping paper on your shopping list

00:40.340 --> 00:42.340
So what day is it?

00:42.340 --> 00:46.640
Today is Thursday, November 13th eight minutes starting now. I

00:47.680 --> 00:52.560
Can play music answer questions get the news and weather create to do this

00:54.440 --> 00:56.440
Much more

00:59.680 --> 01:07.300
Wow introducing Amazon echo she's listening. I wonder why they didn't just call it echo

01:07.960 --> 01:09.960
creepy, yeah

01:09.960 --> 01:15.200
Everyone's being harsh on it, but it's like it's kind of interesting. Yeah, I thought it I actually

01:16.480 --> 01:22.560
Was kind of impressed like it doesn't look like it has a guy over ambitious feature set. No. Well, it's pretty

01:23.560 --> 01:29.720
Pretty I mean it so who doesn't want Jarvis, right? Everybody wants everybody wants to be Tony Stark with Jarvis

01:29.720 --> 01:31.720
Everybody wants the enterprise computer in their house

01:31.920 --> 01:35.680
Obviously, I want to be in my studio and I want to say

01:35.680 --> 01:40.760
Obviously, I want to be in my studio and I want to say, you know

01:42.000 --> 01:44.640
Alexia or computer or Jarvis or whatever

01:45.160 --> 01:51.360
Whatever it is, you know set the temperature in the other room to 75 degrees turn the TV to this channel and you know

01:51.360 --> 01:54.240
Whatever and by the time I walk out there the TVs are ready to go and stuff like that

01:54.760 --> 02:01.240
Obviously that would be amazing. But this thing what does this do the Google now can't do and it's always with you in every single

02:01.240 --> 02:06.160
Great. No, it's not about that. It's about that being a device that does that

02:06.160 --> 02:09.000
I don't know of any because I went around I looked yeah, as soon as I saw it

02:09.000 --> 02:15.480
I thought I don't really want Amazon's thing. I'd rather have the Google one, but I looked around it's like wait a minute

02:15.480 --> 02:18.280
There is none. Yeah, it's really about my device. It's a

02:19.400 --> 02:21.400
culture phone

02:21.560 --> 02:22.560
I

02:22.560 --> 02:26.800
Understand where you're coming from, but there's no sit-in-house device that I can just sit down

02:26.800 --> 02:28.800
Yeah, that's

02:29.880 --> 02:31.880
Well a tablet

02:32.000 --> 02:37.040
Yeah, but you know something you can plug in and use and kind of just have stand there as a little piece

02:38.480 --> 02:41.360
I've got yeah, I've got a couple of couple of questions

02:41.360 --> 02:46.800
The first is is this available in the US now and has anyone got one it is available. I believe I

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Know I don't leave. Okay

02:51.040 --> 02:53.240
I don't feel like buying one. So I didn't even bother

02:53.240 --> 02:58.360
Yeah, you have to go and sign up on the list and then they'll let I think it was a hundred people of

02:59.240 --> 03:01.240
Hundred or so. I can't remember

03:03.080 --> 03:06.560
As anyone as anyone in here got an Amazon fire TV

03:07.080 --> 03:11.280
Now that I will probably be getting for the studio in a little while. I have a few

03:12.040 --> 03:17.240
Friends who told me they are pretty good, but I don't have that they're not just they're not just pretty good

03:17.240 --> 03:19.080
They're damn storming amazing

03:19.080 --> 03:26.040
Yeah, but I was gonna say one of the features on the Amazon TV is voice recognition and it makes it makes the Google voice

03:26.320 --> 03:33.500
Recognition look like amateur hour. It is absolutely amazing. How can that be because what I don't know, but it's so good

03:34.600 --> 03:37.160
Well, no, I mean think about what Google does to get their voice

03:43.200 --> 03:46.060
Yeah, that is a shame if if Amazon

03:46.060 --> 03:52.540
I mean, where would Amazon Amazon doesn't have millions of voice samples a day. Where's Amazon getting this from?

03:58.540 --> 04:03.940
Alone is creepy because that means it's gotta be the fire tablets or no, maybe they're just licensing nuance

04:04.780 --> 04:06.780
Maybe it's because so many people have the fire phone

04:07.260 --> 04:13.020
But we've handed the remote around in the house between different people who've got different voice cadence

04:13.020 --> 04:18.140
So different sexes and this thing just works every single time never misses a beat

04:18.140 --> 04:22.020
It's absolutely brilliant daredevil and says he seems to know it though. What is it?

04:22.500 --> 04:28.420
They have two things. First is they have actually very good machine learning algorithms, which they already use

04:29.020 --> 04:31.020
to know what to buy and

04:31.700 --> 04:36.780
They've been investing actually hiring on that department. Okay for a while. It's in-house

04:36.780 --> 04:42.340
And the there's I'm not sure if it's totally in-house, but they hired people at least

04:43.380 --> 04:51.340
And during these last year, they've been hiring all like a lot of people in this area machine learning algorithms and natural language processing

04:51.580 --> 04:55.780
Okay, and they also have another service they do is something like

04:56.700 --> 05:03.200
Actually persons go in surveying something. I'm not sure on the specifics, but it's some sort of service that it's to

05:03.200 --> 05:06.640
Get people to audit sites and things like that

05:06.640 --> 05:12.520
So I'm figuring that the process of getting some data from them and shouldn't be too hard. Hmm. Yeah

05:13.320 --> 05:21.560
Actually, it's the problem with the actual natural language processing now isn't really getting samples anymore. It's actually

05:22.580 --> 05:24.580
You know being able to

05:24.880 --> 05:27.120
Have an algorithm that can understand. Yeah

05:27.120 --> 05:36.600
I was just gonna say that the Amazon voice recognition is excellent

05:36.600 --> 05:38.600
And whilst Amazon might understand

05:38.800 --> 05:45.760
My buying habits and preferences because it's basically a narrow field of science fiction titles when I hand the remote to my wife

05:45.760 --> 05:50.280
Who's into romantic comedies it picks up and understands everything she's asking for just fine

05:50.280 --> 05:55.380
You know, I suppose in that sense if they know maybe the context is movie titles

05:55.380 --> 05:57.380
Right that really narrows the scope

05:59.380 --> 06:05.780
Because because it's it's movies television music apps and a whole load of other stuff

06:05.780 --> 06:11.860
I'll tell you the only the only trick that Amazon have missed and this is the one thing about the Amazon fire TV that I

06:12.420 --> 06:19.220
Really irritates is that they've that they've walled off this brilliant feature of voice search

06:20.100 --> 06:22.100
from all of the other providers

06:22.100 --> 06:24.100
So you

06:24.300 --> 06:25.820
Yeah

06:25.820 --> 06:27.340
Exactly, so you can

06:27.340 --> 06:33.580
And you can install Netflix, but when you go and ask it to go and search for the walking dead

06:33.580 --> 06:35.660
Yeah, it will only search Amazon

06:35.660 --> 06:43.340
It won't go to any other places and that's that and that is just such a fail because you can see why Amazon are doing it

06:43.340 --> 06:49.060
But they're doing it for all the wrong reasons. Oh, of course they are but they're gonna be very successful at it. Yeah, but

06:49.060 --> 06:53.660
Everything else about it is is it's just brilliant. It's it's

06:54.420 --> 06:59.040
Replaced our Roku in the front room. Yeah, that's what I was thinking too is it might be our Roku

06:59.040 --> 07:03.940
And and it's actually a half decent gaming machine as well as you know, I'm not much of a gamer

07:03.940 --> 07:06.820
So I'm probably not a good reference candidate here

07:06.820 --> 07:12.620
But I play games on my Amazon fire TV now and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best thing I've ever had so

07:13.540 --> 07:15.860
Wimpy once we get into the show a little bit

07:15.860 --> 07:21.620
We got a little something we're gonna tell people about I don't don't say anything but a little something something. Yeah

07:21.620 --> 07:23.620
All right. We'll do that a little bit in the show

07:27.900 --> 07:34.020
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's loaded with protein and which is a very grateful

07:34.180 --> 07:39.180
Happy Veterans Day to all the vets in the audience. My name is Chris and my name is Matt

07:39.180 --> 07:44.100
Hey there Matt, happy Veterans Day to all the vets like we say and Matt. Happy Tuesday to yourself

07:44.100 --> 07:46.100
And happy Tuesday

07:46.100 --> 07:51.020
I know I feel like such a slacker on this this is like the day of the year that I feel like the biggest slacker

07:51.020 --> 07:55.620
Ever doesn't matter how hard I work or how many hours I feel like today. I've been a slacker

07:55.780 --> 08:00.620
So I went out and to celebrate I got I got one of those monster breakfasts

08:00.700 --> 08:07.220
Where it's so much breakfast that you don't eat for pretty much until dinner and I'm still good. I got steak and eggs Matt. Oh

08:07.220 --> 08:14.100
It was nice. Oh Matt. Oh, it was a really there's just there's Tuesdays have been good eat days

08:14.100 --> 08:16.100
I guess so I'm ready to go

08:16.260 --> 08:18.180
You know, hopefully

08:18.180 --> 08:25.180
Hopefully we will avoid the flames in today's episode. We're gonna follow up on the Firefox challenge run through some of the

08:25.820 --> 08:27.820
experiences and challenges that I had

08:28.020 --> 08:33.660
We've got something really fun coming up towards the end of the show and we're also gonna discuss this whole gnome

08:33.660 --> 08:40.300
Versus Groupon over the trademark where that's at right now what Groupon's been saying and how much damn money

08:40.860 --> 08:45.220
The gnome foundation has raised a lot of stuff plus we've got a ton of great feedback

08:45.640 --> 08:52.340
Going on in today's episode. So I think probably the best thing to do is arm ourselves with knowledge that knowledge supplied directly

08:52.700 --> 08:57.460
Thanks to cranial implants that are connected to mumble time appropriate greetings mumble room

08:57.460 --> 08:59.460
I

08:59.860 --> 09:05.300
Thought let me eat at that amazing place nearby the studio. Yeah. Ellie's yeah. Oh gosh. I love that place

09:05.300 --> 09:10.220
It's it's so good. It's so good and like all the people there and I'm like, I'm the only guy

09:10.220 --> 09:13.980
We're not I don't know everybody's name. It's like cheers up in that joint and only it's breakfast

09:14.420 --> 09:16.420
Yeah, it's great

09:16.980 --> 09:21.260
Yeah. Alright, so let's start with let's start with some follow-up emails just a quick one

09:21.260 --> 09:23.160
I'll leave the details in the show notes

09:23.160 --> 09:27.740
But Ben wrote in with sort of one of the best write-ups on how to fix the NVIDIA

09:28.180 --> 09:31.680
V-sync issue that we were seeing or that we had an email about last week

09:31.680 --> 09:37.540
We had a few solutions a Ben had one where you just toss an export line into your dot profile

09:38.220 --> 09:41.980
File and then that will take care of it and he says I love the show

09:41.980 --> 09:47.780
I just wanted to chime in on the game v-sync issues that David from Alabama was experiencing in Linux on plug 65

09:47.860 --> 09:52.740
Basically, he fixed his v-sync issues by forcing the unity compositor to v-sync for him

09:52.740 --> 09:55.220
And he's looking for a way to do the same in gnome

09:55.220 --> 10:00.260
this is not the way to go every time someone suggests using Compton or turning off unit directs full-screen or

10:00.740 --> 10:04.780
Using another way to force the compositor during games. I scream in frustration

10:04.780 --> 10:08.400
You're losing out on a ton of performance and you're increasing input latency in games

10:08.460 --> 10:12.800
Which makes playing twitch games like counter-strike global offensive darn near impossible

10:12.800 --> 10:16.200
So he's got a command in there. You can put in there that I should take care of it

10:16.200 --> 10:18.200
If you're out there having some tearing issues

10:18.200 --> 10:23.800
On video games. Yeah, so thank you Ben for we had a bunch of good responses to now

10:24.360 --> 10:27.240
No, you're in here on your quote-unquote cheap

10:27.800 --> 10:32.480
Podcasting Linux rig right now, right? I am. Okay. Well, I think we'll start this

10:32.480 --> 10:37.720
I'll toss this question to you and then we'll get everybody's input. But here's the here's our first

10:38.320 --> 10:42.240
sort of like I we're putting it actually in the show coverage of

10:42.240 --> 10:48.720
USB headphones on Linux we get this question all the time. We talk about it on the pre-show live stream all the time in the

10:48.720 --> 10:54.560
Mumble room, but now we're gonna get it right here wiggle waffles writes in says hi all I'm absolutely horrible

10:54.560 --> 11:01.240
I have I've had a horrible time troubleshooting tech issues with my mom's c720 running Ubuntu gnome 1404

11:01.440 --> 11:07.600
She now I do it over the phone and she needs a USB headset to make Skype calls while traveling searching the web for Linux compatible

11:07.600 --> 11:13.240
Headphones has proved totally useless and of course manufacturers don't include any such info in their product descriptions

11:13.240 --> 11:18.720
Matt mentioned some arcane sound controller name on last regarding this issue, but I have no idea what headphones they were

11:19.120 --> 11:23.120
Or what type of controller headphones you wouldn't have in them. So any help would be appreciated

11:23.120 --> 11:28.520
I'm looking for something low-cost and basic for Skype calling so no high-end suggestions, frankly

11:28.520 --> 11:32.540
I've decided I'm never installing Linux on a family members computer again because once you install Linux

11:32.540 --> 11:39.700
Your own you're the only tech support they have oh I see his point he says he goes on to say that there's also always

11:39.700 --> 11:44.780
That one hardware feature that doesn't seem to work which is frustrating for him and that they need that has no Linux equivalent

11:44.780 --> 11:49.060
The only success in this area though is he moved his dad to a Linux machine with email web and nothing else and it works

11:49.060 --> 11:50.660
For him, so I suppose it depends on the use

11:50.660 --> 11:54.840
So now he's in a spot where he hasn't been able to success. I think he needs to work on his Google foo

11:55.540 --> 12:00.300
Because there is there are some threads out there for good headsets Matt. What are you wearing right now? Do you know?

12:00.300 --> 12:02.300
It's a pellet

12:03.300 --> 12:09.460
Yeah, I never pronounced this right but a platronics I have you know other Mike set up to the other computer

12:09.460 --> 12:14.620
But on this one specifically now, I have a headset that I got a goodwill for $3. That'll work

12:14.620 --> 12:20.580
I'll send him. I mean hell it's it's not hard to find if it's USB and it goes on your ears. It works

12:20.580 --> 12:25.940
Yeah, that's why that's the big secret is it pretty much works. All right Colonel Linux. You've got your cheap rig there

12:25.940 --> 12:32.660
Can you tell us a little bit about your setup and what kind of Linux any if any you compatibility issues you ran into right?

12:32.660 --> 12:38.700
So my experience is the same essentially almost every USB audio interface. I've used recently

12:39.540 --> 12:43.900
Works there was one exception. That was quite a while ago. I

12:44.940 --> 12:47.700
Plantronics works really really well. In fact, that's what's used in the spaceship

12:47.700 --> 12:53.700
So obviously they know something or two about making headsets, but I've also found that Logitech like the 8 390 for example

12:53.700 --> 12:56.260
They're like 20 bucks Best Buy office max carries them

12:56.260 --> 13:02.700
Amazon of course has them Amazon Prime and then my latest thing because this question keeps coming up is I want decent audio quality

13:03.700 --> 13:06.220
what was the cheapest I could put together a

13:07.140 --> 13:13.760
System that is totally Linux compatible. So you take it out of the box you plug it in no configuration. No, no compiling drivers

13:13.760 --> 13:18.340
No downloading anything. I just wanted to work out of the box. How cheap could I do that and

13:19.540 --> 13:23.100
Now mind you this is not meant for putting in your bag and traveling, right?

13:23.100 --> 13:27.100
This would be if you want to get a little bit better audio quality than you get from USB headset

13:27.100 --> 13:29.100
but I was able to whittle it down to

13:29.180 --> 13:35.020
Just under 200 bucks and I have another microphone on order that's gonna come in and I'm gonna see if I can get it down

13:35.020 --> 13:37.020
to about 150

13:37.100 --> 13:40.260
But I think for for $200 and I'm talking on it right now

13:40.260 --> 13:46.740
I think I think this sounds really good and that gets your USB interface that gets you a mixer get your microphones headphones and a microphone

13:46.740 --> 13:51.000
That's a full Linux audio podcasting rig, which I think we should do a full segment on to be honest

13:51.000 --> 13:55.740
I guess we should but a wimpy you sound pretty good today and you're on a new headset, right? What did you get?

13:55.740 --> 14:00.080
I am well, I asked the question last week because I had a massive audio fail

14:02.220 --> 14:07.500
And I went away and did a bit of research so this week I bought myself

14:08.060 --> 14:14.860
Logitech h800 headset and it's not the cheapest and I'll explain why I used it

14:14.860 --> 14:16.740
First of all in terms of Linux support

14:16.740 --> 14:24.860
It's a wireless headset and mic all built-in with some buttons on the side for volume control and muting and track skipping and stuff

14:24.860 --> 14:27.680
Like that all those all those media keys work

14:28.340 --> 14:35.820
So it's wireless. It has a USB port plug that you put in your USB that shows up on your machine and you just go

14:35.820 --> 14:37.820
So you're using Bluetooth Bluetooth?

14:38.260 --> 14:44.140
It's both so it has two buttons on the headset one to use the USB dongle

14:44.140 --> 14:48.900
Okay, which is how I'm using it now plugged into my Linux workstation to do mumble

14:48.900 --> 14:53.740
And then you just go into your mixer and just say what your mic is and what your headsets are and all that works

14:54.140 --> 15:01.580
But it also has Bluetooth. So you switch the headset to Bluetooth mode and then you compare it with your tablet and your phone

15:03.180 --> 15:06.300
So this device now does all of my audio needs

15:06.300 --> 15:11.200
So you can use it for your computer or to listen to a podcast from a phone or music or something exactly

15:11.200 --> 15:16.700
Yeah, if I'm sitting downstairs and I want to watch a bit of BSG on my tablet

15:16.700 --> 15:21.460
I just put the headset on pair it with the tablet and off I go. So what do you do for the mic?

15:21.460 --> 15:26.940
What's the mic using? Is it the mics built-in? It's built into the headset support pull down integrated mic

15:26.940 --> 15:32.260
Okay. Wow, that is a really cool. It says logic H 800 H 800

15:32.260 --> 15:37.660
Yeah, and there's a there's slightly cheaper models as well, but I quite like this one because of the versatility

15:37.660 --> 15:41.060
We've been able to use it with multiple devices. How do you charge it?

15:41.860 --> 15:48.700
It's a micro USB charger and and so when you plug the receiver in just shows up to Linux as a USB sound card

15:48.900 --> 15:52.780
It does sweet nice recommendation good fine wimpy

15:53.460 --> 16:01.260
Okay, this is something I think about a lot and we're gonna we're gonna get into this discussion around Firefox and Chrome and

16:01.260 --> 16:09.200
And you know, it's one of the things I've noticed a lot in my switch for the week is when something doesn't work, right

16:10.380 --> 16:14.740
you know, there's a lot of different suggestions that come at come at a person and

16:15.820 --> 16:21.500
I I feel like there's a lot of parallels between when we have people switch to Linux and things don't go right for them and

16:21.500 --> 16:27.340
How we respond to that and how when I switched to Firefox and things didn't go right and how people have responded to that

16:27.340 --> 16:29.100
I see a lot of parallels there

16:29.100 --> 16:35.160
so I've been thinking a lot about how what I've just gone through reflects how we handle newcomers to Linux and

16:35.940 --> 16:42.220
This first email or this next email that we're gonna get to sort of follows that that lat theme that we're gonna be talking about

16:42.220 --> 16:45.580
Later today, so mount agent. I think is how you say it

16:46.300 --> 16:49.880
Rodin or mount tangent. I'm not sure says on Sunday show Chris and Matt

16:49.880 --> 16:55.220
We're reminiscing about the good old days of comp is and how the desktop cube and rad flame effects

16:55.220 --> 17:00.180
We're pretty good at starting conversations and getting people to try out Linux

17:00.180 --> 17:05.880
I'm wondering what features are beloved OS is you found to be the most pervasive or I'm sorry persuasive

17:06.340 --> 17:08.120
to new Linux users

17:08.120 --> 17:12.120
To be clear these would be outside the good well-reasoned arguments for switching

17:12.120 --> 17:14.620
He says you can believe in the open source philosophy all day long

17:14.820 --> 17:18.580
But willing to make the leap well sometimes a little shiny helps with that

17:18.580 --> 17:25.100
That's what I'm asking about mine would largely be about Mac users looking at Linux since I work primarily with that user base

17:25.100 --> 17:29.540
I'll second the desktop effects thing as an ongoing on and off again KDE user

17:29.540 --> 17:34.420
I also find that Katie's incredible level of customization cuts both ways with this for some

17:34.420 --> 17:36.020
It's a major draw for others

17:36.020 --> 17:43.220
It's intimidating Mac users seem to have really enjoyed Cairo doc again with the flame effects before iOS and seven and eight

17:43.940 --> 17:47.500
The ability to plug in iOS devices and read external storage was a big hit for them, too

17:47.500 --> 17:49.500
Oh and hilariously for Mac users

17:49.780 --> 17:53.980
Snapping the tiles of the windows, you know, so when you snap a window to the edges, they love that

17:53.980 --> 17:56.640
I still can't understand why Apple doesn't do that in Mac OS

17:56.960 --> 18:02.100
So he says what other shiny features of Linux say be at a desktop environment or otherwise

18:03.140 --> 18:07.080
Do you show folks to start them down the road to switching the Linux?

18:07.080 --> 18:15.900
Multiple desktops multiple desktops is a great one. Of course Windows 10 is getting that finally and Mac OS has spaces

18:15.900 --> 18:22.460
Yeah, but it's it's not nowhere near as good as like, um, I run Cinnamon. I mean I have

18:23.100 --> 18:26.900
10 desktops. Wow all hockey. Wow

18:28.900 --> 18:32.780
Xerox, what do you show them a gnome that you really seems to grab their attention?

18:32.780 --> 18:38.180
If somebody is watching me use my machine and I'm using gnome 3 the first thing they notice is when I

18:38.260 --> 18:43.260
Mouse over to the top left hot corner and everything kind of backs out and I get a nice everything gets out of my way

18:43.260 --> 18:48.220
That kind of thing activity overview, right? They get all over that stuff. Yeah

18:50.700 --> 18:53.540
Yeah, well though when you go to activities overview all the windows you have

18:55.300 --> 19:00.020
Yeah, that's a good one that's a good I also you know what one I find really sweet for Mac users

19:00.020 --> 19:06.100
Which is just hilarious that the Mac doesn't have this. I know I just like when you click the when you click the

19:06.460 --> 19:09.900
Clock in Mac OS it doesn't drop down a calendar like

19:10.580 --> 19:16.580
This is 2014. How do you not? So anyways, so on gnome, you know when I drop down the calendar on gnome

19:16.580 --> 19:20.860
Like I always show them like yeah, and it syncs with my own cloud server and puts all my appointments in there

19:20.860 --> 19:26.380
So that's something that the gnomes got going for it. That's it's pretty nice for the shiny features, too

19:26.380 --> 19:30.300
I it depends on who your audience is right because different people find different things to be shiny

19:30.300 --> 19:32.580
Some people find the ability to boot off of a USB live

19:33.020 --> 19:40.700
Thumb drive and recover your system a shiny feature. Some people think that's not so also the desktop cube. Yeah, you could always

19:44.900 --> 19:46.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah

19:46.500 --> 19:46.980
well

19:46.980 --> 19:48.980
So if you have any ideas leave us some feedback

19:49.300 --> 19:53.040
On what the shiny thing is go go put compass back on your rig or if you've got

19:53.040 --> 19:59.600
A unity go turn on the compass settings manager and turn on the fire if you're writing plasma, you can it's native in Kadewin. Yeah

20:01.600 --> 20:07.120
All right, RA writes in with our last email today says hey JB

20:07.520 --> 20:11.120
With fedora 21 when it does finally come out in December

20:11.840 --> 20:14.060
Probably you guys should review it

20:14.060 --> 20:21.120
I know you will but there's just so much great stuff in there gnome 3.14 system D DNF butter a fart better butter butter

20:21.120 --> 20:26.720
She's for easy for me to say Wayland and all of the new core apps and there's some extra dev tools in there, too

20:26.720 --> 20:32.000
I was I was able to set up my C and C++ and Java environments with just five clicks and

20:32.400 --> 20:38.840
Everything is butter smooth. So this is the first time I've got run and a gnome running under Wayland actually and it's quite good

20:38.840 --> 20:43.320
All the apps I have run nicely probably though with X Wayland now that I think of it

20:43.320 --> 20:46.600
I should look I would love to be in the mobile room when you guys review it would that be possible?

20:46.600 --> 20:52.820
Yes, so stay tuned. We will win fedora 21 comes out have a review and we will probably do the whole comprehensive thing

20:52.820 --> 20:59.080
Where we start the review in Linux action show and we're planning to do some pretty solid follow-up in that following weeks unplugged

20:59.080 --> 21:00.480
The mumble rooms open

21:00.480 --> 21:03.480
So RA you would always be welcome to join us

21:04.720 --> 21:07.080
Yeah from time to time at least so

21:08.680 --> 21:13.760
Haven't kicked you yet. Yeah. All right. So I want to talk about the Firefox switch

21:13.760 --> 21:19.560
I think that's something we should probably get to plus. It's also the 10-year anniversary of Firefox before we get to that though

21:19.560 --> 21:21.200
I'd like to thank digital ocean

21:21.200 --> 21:26.480
They're our first sponsor this week head over to digital ocean comm right now and use our promo code

21:26.640 --> 21:33.040
Unplugged in November when you check out to get a $10 credit now digital oceans only five dollars a month for their droplets

21:33.080 --> 21:36.360
So that's gonna get you a droplet for two months for free to try them out now

21:36.360 --> 21:38.160
Why would you go over to digital ocean my friends?

21:38.160 --> 21:44.440
I will tell you because they rock it's simple cloud hosting and they're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up

21:44.440 --> 21:48.800
A cloud server. I got an email today from Jason who got started in 33 seconds

21:49.080 --> 21:54.280
But they say on average probably get going about 55 seconds or so and pricing plans start at five dollars per month

21:54.320 --> 21:59.600
Their pricing structure is very logical. It incrementally goes up you get all of the more of the things

21:59.600 --> 22:03.500
It's very clearly laid out. They even have hourly pricing if you just need to do some testing

22:03.500 --> 22:11.660
but for five dollars you're gonna get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer connected to

22:11.660 --> 22:17.900
Tier one bandwidth at some of the world's most amazing data centers you can see some of the awesome pictures on their Instagram feed

22:17.900 --> 22:19.540
I'm super jelly. It's one thing

22:19.540 --> 22:22.540
I really miss about working in IT is the really awesome data centers

22:22.540 --> 22:28.340
And they have locations in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam and London multiple data centers you can do private networking

22:28.340 --> 22:34.100
It's really sophisticated stuff, and they manage it all with this dashboard. It is

22:34.740 --> 22:37.640
Amazing the dashboard is super intuitive the control panel is

22:38.060 --> 22:43.340
One of these things that I I wish I could just take it and like make it my idea because I would I would just take

22:43.340 --> 22:46.420
This alone and make this the product and I would become super rich

22:46.420 --> 22:48.780
That's how incredible is and this is just part of DigitalOcean

22:48.780 --> 22:53.920
And they wrap up all of these great features like the ability to do one-click application deployments

22:53.920 --> 23:01.180
Or if perhaps you want to do something like DNS management or a backup or a one-click install of GitLab

23:01.180 --> 23:03.500
You can do all of that right from the dashboard

23:03.500 --> 23:06.940
It's super slick and when you're over there use our promo code

23:07.060 --> 23:10.540
Unplugged November to get a $10 credit and try it up for a couple of months for free and

23:10.700 --> 23:14.420
DigitalOcean is also looking for folks to write tutorials will pay up to $200

23:15.020 --> 23:18.260
So if there's something you're an expert on go write tutorial for me

23:18.260 --> 23:20.860
You might get paid they have editors that will work with you in fact

23:20.860 --> 23:24.280
They even have an open editor position right now for those tutorials

23:24.520 --> 23:29.440
So you could you might be able to get a job over DigitalOcean too if you want to edit some tutorials

23:29.640 --> 23:36.200
That'd be pretty cool. So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code Unplugged November when you check out try them out

23:37.240 --> 23:43.640
It's pretty great. I've got I got cray-cray droplets. I got so many droplets now that Rekai has got droplets on my account

23:43.640 --> 23:46.560
That's I got Rekai's got droplets now. How cool is that right?

23:46.560 --> 23:50.600
And he's doing you better watch out though because I think he might be using it to develop Skynet

23:51.760 --> 23:54.080
So you probably want to get on his good side

23:54.640 --> 24:01.180
DigitalOcean.com use the promo code Unplugged November when you check out and a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged

24:02.040 --> 24:07.920
Okay, so let's start off by saying happy 10th anniversary of Firefox right version like 1.0 came out 10 years ago

24:07.920 --> 24:10.920
They had a big old ad didn't they have it didn't isn't that am I right?

24:10.920 --> 24:14.840
They bought a big ad in like the New York Times or something. I think so. Yeah

24:14.840 --> 24:18.480
If I remember correctly it is pretty cool, and they as part of that

24:18.800 --> 24:21.800
They've released a new developer version of the browser Aurora

24:21.800 --> 24:26.640
They've taken the Aurora name and now it's sort of like it's a development release with a bunch of tools and a new theme

24:26.640 --> 24:28.520
I download and tried it out last night

24:28.520 --> 24:33.460
They also introduced a new feature in Firefox called forget since they've having to go into an entire

24:34.200 --> 24:41.140
Private session you can just forget the last hour or 24 hours or whatever five minutes of your browsing sessions kind of neat

24:41.140 --> 24:45.400
They're also launching project Polaris a privacy initiative and to kick that off

24:45.400 --> 24:50.480
They're starting with a massive boost to the Tor relay network to give Tor more capacity

24:50.480 --> 24:55.120
And they're pledging to make security management simpler and more straightforward in

24:55.760 --> 24:58.280
Firefox so a pretty cool 10th anniversary

24:58.880 --> 25:00.880
for Firefox

25:00.880 --> 25:05.080
So last week well, I don't remember exactly even how it went down on the pre-show

25:05.080 --> 25:11.440
We were like it somehow it came up that I run Chrome at chromium. I should say I don't actually run Chrome

25:11.440 --> 25:13.960
Because it's just a little bit more of a pain in the ass to get on ours

25:14.480 --> 25:20.760
So I run chromium and I'm I I like it a lot as far as a browser goes it has issues

25:20.760 --> 25:22.560
I think it's too resource intensive

25:22.560 --> 25:28.800
And I'm also not a huge fan of some of the some of the ways that Google seems to use it to push an agenda

25:28.800 --> 25:32.200
This is super nitpicky, but like today on all my computers

25:32.200 --> 25:35.960
I fired up Chrome for the first time in a week, and it's kind of like a welcome back

25:35.960 --> 25:39.160
It's like all my computers are spamming me to donate to ebola now

25:39.720 --> 25:41.280
It's a good cause

25:41.280 --> 25:48.200
But like my browser should not be used as a platform for Google to deliver me messages like that right and I'm not super comfortable

25:48.200 --> 25:50.520
With that kind of thing and that's happening in chromium

25:51.200 --> 25:53.600
And the other thing about it is I don't like the ie

25:54.240 --> 25:56.240
Factor that Chrome is starting to enjoy

25:56.520 --> 25:59.600
You know you're seeing new services that launch that require Chrome

25:59.600 --> 26:05.120
I think we probably at least all of us have seen that at least once Google's own inbox product that they just launched only works

26:05.120 --> 26:07.120
in Chrome

26:07.500 --> 26:11.960
So these these are some of the reasons. I also am a big fan of the Mozilla foundation

26:11.960 --> 26:14.720
I like that they push forward an open web platform

26:15.200 --> 26:21.680
And I think that they're you know and as far as their interest are more in line with end users interest than Google's probably are

26:22.880 --> 26:27.160
So I'm a fan of Firefox all around. I mean I have used Firefox

26:27.160 --> 26:33.120
Literally since the day the project was born right? I mean I I remember before there was a Firefox

26:33.120 --> 26:36.520
I remember after Firefox. I mean I'm really a big fan of Firefox

26:36.520 --> 26:38.520
I don't think you gave it enough never a chance

26:39.400 --> 26:46.080
So I mean I literally I mean I remember I remember when 1.0 shipped. I clearly remember the day

26:47.320 --> 26:50.520
And it was a really big deal because it took a very long time

26:50.520 --> 26:55.520
It felt like to get there at least back then it was a huge it was a huge huge deal. Yeah

26:55.520 --> 26:58.800
Yeah, yeah, and this is really it was a big deal

26:58.800 --> 27:05.480
and this was really before people talked online like in like social in like a social way like there was message forms and and

27:05.880 --> 27:08.560
BBS's and there was like there was discussion forums

27:08.560 --> 27:12.560
But there wasn't like we don't have like this instant buzz about things like we have

27:12.560 --> 27:17.880
Today where like the Gnome Foundation can raise like a ton of money in like 24 hours like we don't have that level of connectivity

27:17.880 --> 27:27.240
But even back then we were all buzzing about Firefox 1.0. Oh, yeah, and it was like a horribly ugly

27:27.520 --> 27:33.560
GTK application back then to super ugly really bad, but you know what rocked it loved it

27:33.560 --> 27:39.720
It was the best browser ever it really was it was so much better in the Internet Explorer for a long time

27:41.560 --> 27:45.580
Yeah, I know but at some point I I switched over to Chrome

27:45.580 --> 27:51.540
You know just to try it out, I guess and I found myself pretty happy and I found extensions that work really well for me

27:51.540 --> 27:54.020
On the pre show though people like Chris. Why are you using Chrome?

27:54.020 --> 27:57.140
You should switch over to Firefox and everybody ganged up on me

27:57.140 --> 28:00.180
And I finally caved right as the show started and said alright

28:00.180 --> 28:05.220
I'll try Firefox out for a week and a few other folks joined me on the challenge

28:05.220 --> 28:07.820
And we'd have some of them on the show here today and in fact

28:07.820 --> 28:13.480
We also heard from just people in the audience that were taking the challenge now whom in the chat room Matt

28:13.480 --> 28:17.240
Managed to go out and collect the moments

28:17.880 --> 28:19.880
That throughout the whole week

28:20.200 --> 28:24.320
I've been using Firefox and throughout the whole week different moments on air

28:24.640 --> 28:28.680
My browser has crashed on me and left me stranded in the middle of the show

28:28.800 --> 28:31.640
Whom was polite enough to go out and collect some of those for us

28:31.640 --> 28:35.480
So I'll start with probably the one that was the most egregious. We're paying the bills

28:35.560 --> 28:39.520
We're about to watch Kyra's app pick and Firefox crashes on us

28:39.520 --> 28:44.400
Here's the clip that I get from the ladies who just want to hear my voice. Oh, yeah, let's find out here we go

28:45.640 --> 28:47.640
No, you cannot speak to Kira Longfield

28:48.200 --> 28:50.200
No, I don't need duck cleaning

28:51.360 --> 28:53.360
I'm Kyra in this thing's app of the week

28:55.720 --> 28:57.720
The app was so so awesome

28:58.760 --> 29:02.920
It's not Kyra's fault. It's totally Firefox crashing on me. Hold on let's play it again. Go Kyra go!

29:03.120 --> 29:06.840
Right so that okay. Alright, so there was a there was crash number one

29:06.840 --> 29:12.600
Here it was crash number two in the same episode and he launched a user-friendly system based on arch

29:12.600 --> 29:17.720
And I want to play a little bit of his Kickstarter video from that effort so that way for some of you who might

29:17.720 --> 29:19.720
Oh, Firefox is killing me!

29:19.720 --> 29:21.720
Seriously?

29:21.720 --> 29:27.080
Theoretically, oh man, so the Firefox crashes right there as I'm trying to seek in the video again

29:27.080 --> 29:32.680
You might notice a theme here. It was another flash video now. I actually haven't seen the rest of these clips yet

29:32.680 --> 29:36.320
I don't remember these but here was another example of Firefox crashing on air

29:36.320 --> 29:38.320
Hey Firefox!

29:38.320 --> 29:40.320
How do you people use Firefox?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.320
Look at how it's rendering my Google Plus page!

29:42.320 --> 29:44.320
It's great as long as you're not doing anything with Google

29:45.560 --> 29:50.520
Look at oh, yeah, that's right. That was when it totally that's when it totally mis-rendered the Google Plus page when I was trying to

29:50.520 --> 29:56.920
Talk about system 76. Alright, so then finally somebody catches me. I show my extension. I have a lot of extensions

29:56.920 --> 29:58.440
Oh my god

29:58.440 --> 30:00.880
Dude, how is your browser even run?

30:00.880 --> 30:06.880
Fucking far, far, far. But here's the thing!

30:06.880 --> 30:10.880
Alright, so I did have a lot of extensions. Just a couple, just a couple.

30:10.880 --> 30:16.880
But yeah, so there, so they could crash, they could also crash during Tech Talk today on me a couple of times

30:16.880 --> 30:20.880
So it's been a pretty rough week. Not only did it, not only was stability an issue

30:20.880 --> 30:26.880
But also just the same extension selection wasn't really available. Now, does that mean Firefox is horrible?

30:26.880 --> 30:34.880
I don't think so, but I don't know like a lot of people said oh Chris, it's your extensions or Chris is this or that

30:34.880 --> 30:40.880
And I was you know going through I just thought to myself well doesn't at the end of the day really matter how the browser

30:40.880 --> 30:45.880
Handles a catastrophe? Like if even if an extension craps the bed, well bad on that extension

30:45.880 --> 30:50.880
But even worse on the browser for totally dumping out, right? Because that's not what Chrome does, right?

30:50.880 --> 30:58.880
So I don't know. So I don't want to get too far into it. First, I want to ask Popey. Popey, I know you've been working with it for a week

30:58.880 --> 31:03.880
You're still in the Firefox challenge mode right now. How are you doing? Are you going to stick with it for another week?

31:03.880 --> 31:13.880
So to be fair, it's worth noting that we've been shipping Firefox since Ubuntu 4.10 which was 10 years ago

31:13.880 --> 31:22.880
And we shipped Firefox 0.99 in our first release of Ubuntu and it's been the default browser for every single release of Ubuntu since then

31:22.880 --> 31:35.880
Okay. However, I have flipped between various browsers for years and I think we came to a mutual decision last week to

31:35.880 --> 31:45.880
Both try a week of Firefox because we've both been using Chromium or Chrome mostly. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I have everything installed even Midori

31:45.880 --> 31:54.880
From time to time I use that for like a Gmail login or something. Right. And so and I've always had Firefox since I've never uninstalled

31:54.880 --> 31:59.880
I'm not one of those people who are zealous and will like remove any apps that I don't use by default

31:59.880 --> 32:06.880
But so I've been using Chromium and there's a couple of things that I liked about Chromium and Chrome that I've been using

32:06.880 --> 32:13.880
So I switched to Firefox a week ago and actually whilst I've been bitching and moaning

32:13.880 --> 32:22.880
Two things that have annoyed me most was the fact that it slowed down dramatically and ate all my CPUs and all my RAM

32:22.880 --> 32:33.880
And I'm on a laptop with an i7 CPU and 16 gig of RAM and it ate it all up with and I wasn't I only have two extensions installed

32:33.880 --> 32:39.880
And at the time when it ate all my RAM I had like half a dozen tabs open

32:39.880 --> 32:48.880
So I'm not normally in Chrome or Chromium I will have 50 60 maybe 100 tabs open and if it starts eating my CPU

32:48.880 --> 32:54.880
I'll be like, OK, I'm being a bit of a dick with my browser now and I'll close some of the tabs

32:54.880 --> 33:04.880
But or Chromium will do that for me and it will start killing off tabs. Yeah. When it has a bad day. Did you have any crashing? Fair enough

33:04.880 --> 33:13.880
Did you have any crashing? Firefox? Yeah. Nothing like you had. I had a couple of occasions this week where my entire laptop rebooted

33:13.880 --> 33:21.880
And I've not had that for some time, but I can't pin that on Firefox. I think it's actually Intel video driver problem

33:21.880 --> 33:30.880
And I have filed that and that's an upstream bug. Right. But the problems I've had is more slowness and eating all my resources

33:30.880 --> 33:36.880
However, I think it's mostly down to the fact that I tend to leave my laptop running

33:36.880 --> 33:44.880
I rarely restart the browser. I just shut the lid, suspend it, wake it up and carry on. And I think on my system

33:44.880 --> 33:52.880
Firefox doesn't like being left running for a very long period of time, like days. All right. So Wimpy, what was I know you kind of had a similar path

33:52.880 --> 33:57.880
What did you do exactly? Did you were you a Chromium user that tried Firefox for a while or vice versa?

33:57.880 --> 34:08.880
The other way around. So actually, I adopted Chrome really early on. So very early on in sort of the alpha beta stage in around 2008

34:08.880 --> 34:17.880
And that was because it had a really nifty JavaScript JIT compiler at the time, which we needed to test some prototype code on for work

34:17.880 --> 34:25.880
So for work, I worked with aircraft and aircraft data and we wanted to plot thousands of samples of aircraft data in a browser

34:25.880 --> 34:30.880
And you simply couldn't do that back then and suddenly Chrome turned up and it changed the game

34:30.880 --> 34:37.880
So ever since then, I've been using Chrome because I started using it and I went through the growing pains and I sort of stuck with it

34:37.880 --> 34:42.880
But about a year ago, I noticed Chrome rendering popular websites in strange ways

34:42.880 --> 34:51.880
So I started using Firefox and then I just switched back to Firefox. So I've been using Firefox exclusively for about 12 months

34:51.880 --> 35:00.880
And to be honest with you, other than the rendering problems that I'd had with Chrome previously, I couldn't really tell anything between the two browsers

35:00.880 --> 35:06.880
But I thought I'd take a closer look as you were doing this this week and I've had a chat with Popey in the week

35:06.880 --> 35:14.880
And running Firefox and Chrome side by side, what I definitely noticed is Chrome is significantly faster than Firefox

35:14.880 --> 35:20.880
And I didn't believe Popey when he was telling me the subjective metrics about how much faster it was

35:20.880 --> 35:24.880
So I went off and I did it properly. I know, right? I'm a big fat liar

35:24.880 --> 35:31.880
Well, I just I'm just skeptical by nature, I suppose. But I went away and did some tests

35:31.880 --> 35:38.880
And whilst you do these browser benchmarks that kind of mean something, if you actually run the two browsers side by side

35:38.880 --> 35:46.880
You can see the difference. And it was when I could see the difference in the rendering time and the smoothness and the transition

35:46.880 --> 35:52.880
And it was quicker and I just felt like I was in better control of the browser

35:52.880 --> 35:57.880
Right. And I also feel like the UI responds faster, like tabs open and close faster

35:57.880 --> 36:02.880
Like it's not struggling to to open that tab up if there's something else going on in the browser

36:02.880 --> 36:07.880
Sometimes it's like Firefox is struggling with that and like there's only one or two worker threads

36:07.880 --> 36:15.880
Yeah. Yeah. So well, you know, Chrome and Chromium have some tricks that they play that make it look faster than it really is

36:15.880 --> 36:22.880
I think so, yeah. That's fine. I don't I don't care if they're tricks. They're tricks that fool my eyes

36:22.880 --> 36:26.880
It's not just what you see when I ran the various browser benchmarks

36:26.880 --> 36:32.880
Chrome, you know, on my system was was beating Firefox two times over every time

36:32.880 --> 36:38.880
Really? Was that from a startup or after you had a bunch of stuff?

36:38.880 --> 36:45.880
Sorry, there's a yes. So from startup go to the same benchmark site, run the benchmark and post the results

36:45.880 --> 36:48.880
So the conditions were the same. OK, gotcha.

36:48.880 --> 36:54.880
So here's a couple other things, just anecdotal, just my experiences

36:54.880 --> 36:59.880
So day one didn't go super great. Firefox sync for some reason, just go figure, right?

36:59.880 --> 37:07.880
Didn't actually sync on the I had a new install, set up the browser, logged into Firefox sync on the browser the night before

37:07.880 --> 37:11.880
Went about, did some web reading, probably used the browser for about an hour, closed it

37:11.880 --> 37:18.880
Came back, moved my laptop, brought my bonobo to the studio, opened it up, launched Firefox like around 8.30, then went on air around 9

37:18.880 --> 37:23.880
So and then I go to start the show and realize that none of my bookmarks had synced, none of my extensions had synced

37:23.880 --> 37:27.880
Yeah, and that was a little like, oh, man, day one I got burned by sync

37:27.880 --> 37:33.880
But I was able to if I but then so to fix it, I had to delete my profile and then create a new profile and set up sync again

37:33.880 --> 37:42.880
Same account, then sync just worked. Not a huge deal, but what I walked away from is when I would run into issues

37:42.880 --> 37:48.880
So a couple of things would happen. People would, well actually, I guess I have a clip of it here

37:48.880 --> 37:53.880
I might, I'm gonna play this clip from last, it might be a little ranty, but I'm gonna play it from the heat of the moment

37:53.880 --> 37:56.880
And I'll see if this covers what I was just about to say

37:56.880 --> 37:59.880
Oh, you need to be able to copy that as HTML? Just install

37:59.880 --> 38:05.880
So how the conversation literally started was, Chris, just install an extension to have it have the same features as Chrome

38:05.880 --> 38:08.880
You need that thing that Chrome can do? Just install

38:08.880 --> 38:11.880
So the conversation starts, is Chris, just install an extension

38:11.880 --> 38:16.880
And now, now the conversation is Chris, you got too many extensions, what do you expect to happen?

38:16.880 --> 38:19.880
So I can't use the browser because I don't have an extension

38:19.880 --> 38:22.880
And then once I have too many extensions, now the problem is I got too many extensions

38:22.880 --> 38:26.880
And it's literally gone from Tuesday to Chris, install an extension

38:26.880 --> 38:34.880
Literally, people are so determined that I install extensions that they literally, between Tuesday and today, developed extensions for me

38:34.880 --> 38:39.880
Created extensions, I've installed those extensions, they're great, they make, they add

38:39.880 --> 38:41.880
But now it's Chris, you got too many extensions

38:41.880 --> 38:45.880
Now on the other side of that, Chrome is a big bloated turd biscuit

38:45.880 --> 38:49.880
I mean, it's like, it literally, it just starts processes to piss me off

38:49.880 --> 38:53.880
I hate Chrome, I hate it with a passion, I want to light it on fire and burn it

38:53.880 --> 38:56.880
That's one of the things, I don't like Chrome, I don't like it

38:56.880 --> 39:00.880
I literally, I use a little bit of Midori, I use some other browsers

39:00.880 --> 39:03.880
But generally for just casual, I'm doing random stuff on the internet

39:03.880 --> 39:05.880
I use Firefox because it's great for me

39:05.880 --> 39:08.880
Alright, so I got to install GST

39:08.880 --> 39:14.880
So what I found was, I found people were super willing to constantly volunteer things I should do

39:14.880 --> 39:17.880
Like a lot of going to your about config and change this

39:17.880 --> 39:21.880
Enable hardware acceleration, disable hardware acceleration, install this extension

39:21.880 --> 39:24.880
Oh yeah, that extension that you needed, well that only goes in the status bar

39:24.880 --> 39:26.880
Well the status bar doesn't actually exist anymore

39:26.880 --> 39:28.880
So now you have to install an extension that brings back the status bar

39:28.880 --> 39:31.880
And then once you bring back the status bar, you can customize the status bar

39:31.880 --> 39:33.880
And take the button out of the status bar and move it up to the menu bar

39:33.880 --> 39:35.880
And then uninstall that extension

39:35.880 --> 39:38.880
And then go install this extension so that way, it's like it was ongoing

39:38.880 --> 39:40.880
And then when I started having stability issues

39:40.880 --> 39:43.880
Which were clearly related to the Adobe Flash plugin

39:43.880 --> 39:47.880
Not related to the other extensions, clearly related to the Adobe Flash plugin

39:47.880 --> 39:50.880
But immediately it's, well you have too many extensions, you need to do this

39:50.880 --> 39:53.880
You're doing this wrong, and it sort of immediately went hostile

39:53.880 --> 39:57.880
And what I started thinking about was, people that are switching to Linux

39:57.880 --> 40:00.880
They have these problems in a much broader context

40:00.880 --> 40:02.880
With all kinds of little pain points when they switch over to Linux

40:02.880 --> 40:07.880
And I also see the same kind of, well what do you mean it's not working for you?

40:07.880 --> 40:08.880
Well then you're doing it wrong

40:08.880 --> 40:11.880
And I got emails where people critiqued my technical literacy

40:11.880 --> 40:14.880
Because it's not that Firefox was having issues

40:14.880 --> 40:18.880
It's not that it wasn't properly handling when the Flash plugin crashed or whatever was happening

40:18.880 --> 40:21.880
What the problem was, is I wasn't technically literate to use the browser

40:21.880 --> 40:23.880
And I didn't care enough about open source

40:23.880 --> 40:27.880
I probably got nearly a hundred comments to that regard

40:27.880 --> 40:29.880
And it's ridiculous

40:29.880 --> 40:38.880
And not only is it ridiculous, it's antithetical to everything that I used to know about Fox

40:38.880 --> 40:41.880
Anyways, I want people to just consider it

40:41.880 --> 40:45.880
I think what we have to get better at, and I know this is maybe a soapbox of mine

40:45.880 --> 40:50.880
But I think what we have to get better at is acknowledging that everything has strengths and attributes to it

40:50.880 --> 40:53.880
Like I started this segment talking about what I like about Firefox

40:53.880 --> 40:57.880
The history I have with it, and why the Mozilla Foundation is great

40:57.880 --> 41:00.880
I also use Firefox on every computer I have

41:00.880 --> 41:04.880
But my primary get work done browser has to remain, in my opinion, Chrome

41:04.880 --> 41:06.880
And I think the bigger problem here is

41:06.880 --> 41:08.880
Is that what we are really beginning to see

41:08.880 --> 41:11.880
Is the division that Mozilla is actually up against

41:11.880 --> 41:15.880
Which is not Firefox versus Internet Explorer

41:15.880 --> 41:17.880
Or Firefox versus Chrome

41:17.880 --> 41:21.880
It is Firefox versus every single other WebKit browser on the market

41:21.880 --> 41:24.880
Because application developers are writing WebKit first

41:24.880 --> 41:26.880
They're not necessarily even writing Chrome first

41:26.880 --> 41:27.880
They're writing WebKit first

41:27.880 --> 41:30.880
Then they might, specifically, maybe write Chrome first

41:30.880 --> 41:32.880
And that's what Firefox's real challenge is

41:32.880 --> 41:34.880
At their ten year mark going forward now

41:34.880 --> 41:37.880
Is their lunch is getting eaten by WebKit

41:37.880 --> 41:39.880
WebKit is the winning team right now

41:39.880 --> 41:42.880
And Firefox needs to have an answer to that

41:42.880 --> 41:45.880
And I understand Electrolysis is a thing that's coming

41:45.880 --> 41:47.880
That's going to make Firefox super more amazing

41:47.880 --> 41:48.880
And it's not going to crash as much

41:48.880 --> 41:51.880
But honestly, to me, it feels too late

41:51.880 --> 41:53.880
And it makes me sad a little bit

41:53.880 --> 41:54.880
It doesn't mean it's going away

41:54.880 --> 41:55.880
It doesn't mean it's a bad browser

41:55.880 --> 41:57.880
It doesn't mean it's not going to get way more awesome

41:57.880 --> 41:59.880
It doesn't mean that the Mozilla Foundation isn't incredible

41:59.880 --> 42:01.880
It doesn't mean you're a bad person for wanting to use Firefox

42:01.880 --> 42:03.880
And I'm a bad person for wanting to use Chromium though

42:03.880 --> 42:08.880
To be fair, at Google they're actually removing the WebKit-centric stuff

42:08.880 --> 42:10.880
Because they don't want people to do that

42:10.880 --> 42:16.880
So that's why Blink has removed all of the WebKit CSS commands and stuff

42:16.880 --> 42:17.880
That are specific to WebKit

42:17.880 --> 42:22.880
Because people were doing that and breaking stuff in Opera and Firefox at the time

42:22.880 --> 42:25.880
And Google didn't want to create breakage

42:25.880 --> 42:26.880
They wanted standardization

42:26.880 --> 42:28.880
So Blink has that stuff gone

42:28.880 --> 42:29.880
Very good

42:29.880 --> 42:32.880
By the way, I looked into

42:32.880 --> 42:34.880
Actually, Rekai hooked me up with the info

42:34.880 --> 42:38.880
But I read through the info on Chromium versus Chrome

42:38.880 --> 42:41.880
And it seems like Wikipedia maybe has one of the best breakdowns

42:41.880 --> 42:42.880
There's several

42:42.880 --> 42:43.880
Google even has their own Wiki page on it

42:43.880 --> 42:45.880
But Wikipedia

42:45.880 --> 42:47.880
So here's a couple of things

42:47.880 --> 42:49.880
By the way, I'm a Chromium user

42:49.880 --> 42:51.880
Chromium is an open source project

42:51.880 --> 42:52.880
It's BSD licensed

42:52.880 --> 42:54.880
There's other components that have different licensing

42:54.880 --> 42:57.880
It's got a lot of little asterisks at the end of that

42:57.880 --> 42:59.880
So that was the other thing

42:59.880 --> 43:02.880
People were kind of jumping on me for using another open source project

43:02.880 --> 43:03.880
Either way

43:03.880 --> 43:07.880
There is a couple of things that Chromium does not have

43:07.880 --> 43:10.880
That I think people should consider if they were going to try

43:10.880 --> 43:14.880
The print subsystem apparently is different in the final Chrome version

43:14.880 --> 43:18.880
In Chromium, it'll hand it off to your operating system

43:18.880 --> 43:21.880
But in Chrome, they're using the entire Google print subsystem

43:21.880 --> 43:24.880
Which ties in with the Google Cloud Print and all of that

43:24.880 --> 43:25.880
Of course, no ACC built-ins

43:25.880 --> 43:28.880
It's going to have to rely on your operating system codecs

43:28.880 --> 43:33.880
The tracking is opt-in in Chromium versus opt-on, I guess, in regular Chrome

43:33.880 --> 43:36.880
I might have that wrong, but it's definitely opt-in in Chromium

43:36.880 --> 43:38.880
And no auto-update features

43:38.880 --> 43:40.880
So you're going to have to rely on your package manager

43:40.880 --> 43:42.880
Which I prefer to have my package manager do that anyway

43:42.880 --> 43:43.880
So that's fine with me

43:43.880 --> 43:44.880
And of course, the integrated flash

43:44.880 --> 43:46.880
Sorry, what's got no auto-update?

43:46.880 --> 43:49.880
Chromium doesn't use the Google updater

43:49.880 --> 43:51.880
It uses your operating system's package manager

43:51.880 --> 43:52.880
Like it should

43:52.880 --> 43:53.880
Okay

43:53.880 --> 43:55.880
And no built-in flash

43:55.880 --> 43:59.880
No AAC, no built-in flash, no Google updater, and no Google Cloud Print

43:59.880 --> 44:03.880
So from the Ubuntu point of view, those are both the same

44:03.880 --> 44:06.880
They both come as Debian packages from an archive

44:06.880 --> 44:07.880
Yeah, yeah

44:07.880 --> 44:12.880
One comes from the Ubuntu archive, one comes from a Debian Google archive somewhere

44:12.880 --> 44:16.880
It doesn't have the multimedia extension either

44:16.880 --> 44:19.880
Oh, that's a good point

44:19.880 --> 44:20.880
Yes, that's a good one

44:20.880 --> 44:24.880
And also, it's being pointed out that no remote desktop either

44:24.880 --> 44:25.880
Which is a great point there, Dublin

44:25.880 --> 44:26.880
Yeah, go ahead

44:26.880 --> 44:31.880
Chris, the reason you're getting hate for using Chromium is because you keep accidentally calling it Chrome

44:31.880 --> 44:34.880
Well, I kind of use both

44:34.880 --> 44:36.880
So I kind of interchange them depending

44:36.880 --> 44:39.880
I mean, I primarily use Chromium on the majority

44:39.880 --> 44:42.880
Because it's a little bit quicker to install on an Archbox

44:42.880 --> 44:45.880
Yeah, and people tend to get a little bit funny about

44:45.880 --> 44:49.880
Whenever I've said I'm using Chromium

44:49.880 --> 44:52.880
The question that always follows is, do you mean Chrome?

44:52.880 --> 44:55.880
Or if I say I'm using Chrome, they ask, do you mean Chromium?

44:55.880 --> 45:00.880
It's like, no, I'm 42, I've managed to differentiate between Chrome and Chromium

45:00.880 --> 45:02.880
If I'm talking about Chrome, I'll say Chrome

45:02.880 --> 45:04.880
If I'm talking about Chromium, I'll say Chromium

45:04.880 --> 45:08.880
But sometimes, you want to talk about both together

45:08.880 --> 45:12.880
Because collectively, Chrome and Chromium are very similar code bases

45:12.880 --> 45:15.880
I find it, yeah, to be pretty similar

45:15.880 --> 45:19.880
But to me, what this was really revealing to

45:19.880 --> 45:23.880
Was just how freaking important the web browsers become in my workflow

45:23.880 --> 45:26.880
Not only do I use it to show most of the visuals in all of our shows

45:26.880 --> 45:29.880
But the research and the pipeline of a lot of our media management

45:29.880 --> 45:32.880
And all of it is just browser based now

45:32.880 --> 45:36.880
Thankfully, I felt like at the end of this

45:36.880 --> 45:40.880
If Chrome or Chromium went away tomorrow, I would be okay

45:40.880 --> 45:43.880
I would make do, especially since the community was pretty awesome

45:43.880 --> 45:46.880
And there was a couple of user extensions that were

45:46.880 --> 45:49.880
You know, use Greasemonkey and then add a user script to that

45:49.880 --> 45:52.880
And they wrote a couple of those for me to do markdown stuff

45:52.880 --> 45:54.880
So I mean, there would be ways around it

45:54.880 --> 45:57.880
So the thing I've learned about this

45:57.880 --> 46:01.880
Is that there are people who are exceedingly passionate about Firefox

46:01.880 --> 46:06.880
And they want me to have a good experience on Firefox

46:06.880 --> 46:10.880
So rather than dismiss this whole experiment

46:10.880 --> 46:13.880
And go back to using Chromium as I did

46:13.880 --> 46:16.880
I'm going to stick with Firefox, I've removed Flash from my system

46:16.880 --> 46:21.880
So I'm doing everything I can to avoid Flash based websites

46:21.880 --> 46:24.880
Or Flash streaming video, which means your website actually, Chris

46:24.880 --> 46:28.880
You need to provide an easy way for me to be able to watch the live stream

46:28.880 --> 46:31.880
Without Flash, right? That's on you, okay?

46:31.880 --> 46:37.880
Well, why don't you just grab the RTSP

46:37.880 --> 46:40.880
Okay, I'll do that

46:40.880 --> 46:45.880
Yeah, because there's not really an embeddable open source live stream solution

46:45.880 --> 46:49.880
No, no, I don't mind not having an embeddable thing

46:49.880 --> 46:52.880
I'd like a URL somewhere that I could paste into

46:52.880 --> 46:58.880
I actually used a nice tool that one of the other guys in the mumble mentioned earlier

46:58.880 --> 47:00.880
Called Livestreamer

47:00.880 --> 47:05.880
But that didn't find any embeddable streams to watch from your page

47:05.880 --> 47:08.880
Grab the RTMP link, or RTSP, I don't remember which one it is

47:08.880 --> 47:10.880
Okay, I'll try that

47:10.880 --> 47:12.880
And then if you have MPV or a VLC, but MPV is really great

47:12.880 --> 47:16.880
You just do MPV and then the URL and it'll fire up

47:16.880 --> 47:20.880
You know what we should do is like a short, like we have jblive.fm for the audio stream

47:20.880 --> 47:22.880
I should do something like that for the

47:22.880 --> 47:24.880
That would be a great idea, because then you can just tell people to go to it

47:24.880 --> 47:26.880
I'll think about it, yeah, that's a good idea

47:26.880 --> 47:28.880
Yeah, because that is a problem, and we get that comment all the time

47:28.880 --> 47:32.880
And of course the whole website is all HTML5 video except for the live stream

47:32.880 --> 47:35.880
And it's really, you can thank HLS and H264 for that

47:35.880 --> 47:41.880
It's kind of like, sickingly enough, Flash is one of the best assemblers of HLS video on the market

47:41.880 --> 47:43.880
As disgusting as that is

47:43.880 --> 47:48.880
And you can throw it on a new iPhone 6 or a Nexus 5

47:48.880 --> 47:52.880
And they will struggle to do as well of a job as Flash can do for whatever reason

47:52.880 --> 47:54.880
Alan could talk to you all day about it

47:54.880 --> 47:58.880
But it really comes down to the fact that the standards we use for video streaming right now super suck

47:58.880 --> 48:00.880
But we've just kind of moved ahead with it

48:00.880 --> 48:03.880
There's also a Jupyter Broadcasting XBMC add-on that you could use

48:03.880 --> 48:09.880
Yeah, and if you watch on a Roku, there's a Jupyter Broadcasting app and the live stream is on that

48:09.880 --> 48:13.880
And I could watch on my tablet or something else like that

48:13.880 --> 48:16.880
That's not a problem, so I'm going to try and stick with Firefox

48:16.880 --> 48:20.880
And I'm going to take advice from various people in the Mumble channel

48:20.880 --> 48:26.880
Who've suggested ways in which I can debug the issues and make sure that I follow up stream

48:26.880 --> 48:29.880
And ensure the experience is better for everyone else as well

48:29.880 --> 48:34.880
So my thoughts would be I would go the no flash route for sure

48:34.880 --> 48:37.880
But I can't because of some of the media management I have for JB

48:37.880 --> 48:41.880
But I was thinking, I've tried running in Terminal and stuff like that to get some output

48:41.880 --> 48:43.880
But I didn't really get anything very beneficial

48:43.880 --> 48:46.880
But my thought was to experiment around a little bit more

48:46.880 --> 48:51.880
Because I know exactly what conditions caused it to crash because I could repeat it over and over again

48:51.880 --> 48:54.880
See if I can get it to do it and then maybe as a 10th birthday present to Firefox

48:54.880 --> 48:57.880
I'll send off a few bug reports over the weekend

48:57.880 --> 48:59.880
You're such a nice man

48:59.880 --> 49:03.880
Hey, happy birthday guys, here's some bugs

49:03.880 --> 49:08.880
Alright, so we've got to talk about, boy, oh my gosh

49:08.880 --> 49:12.880
We've really got to get going because we have some really exciting stuff to talk about

49:12.880 --> 49:14.880
Wimpy's going to share something awesome

49:14.880 --> 49:17.880
And we've also, you know what, I don't think the Gnome Groupon thing will take too long

49:17.880 --> 49:19.880
But we've got to talk about it just real quick

49:19.880 --> 49:21.880
But before we do that, I want to thank Ting

49:21.880 --> 49:23.880
Go over to linux.ting.com right now everybody

49:23.880 --> 49:27.880
linux.ting.com, that'll take $25 off your first Ting device

49:27.880 --> 49:30.880
Or if you have a Ting compatible device, they'll give you $25 credit

49:30.880 --> 49:33.880
linux.ting.com, you don't know what Ting is?

49:33.880 --> 49:35.880
What is the matter with you?

49:35.880 --> 49:38.880
Ting is mobile that makes sense, no contracts, no determination fees

49:38.880 --> 49:41.880
You only pay for what you use, it's a flat $6 for your line

49:41.880 --> 49:45.880
And then whatever your usage is, that's what you pay

49:45.880 --> 49:47.880
You want another phone? It's $6

49:47.880 --> 49:50.880
You want another phone? You could be a baller like me

49:50.880 --> 49:53.880
I've got three phones and I'm up here and I'm paying like $45

49:53.880 --> 49:55.880
But then when I go out and I show the ladies all my phones

49:55.880 --> 49:57.880
They're like, that's so impressive with all your phones

49:57.880 --> 49:59.880
Why do you have so many phones?

49:59.880 --> 50:00.880
And I tell them I have Ting

50:00.880 --> 50:02.880
linux.ting.com, go check them out

50:02.880 --> 50:05.880
No old customer service? Yeah, that's another perk

50:05.880 --> 50:07.880
You don't have to wait for a human

50:07.880 --> 50:09.880
You just call them up and they answer

50:09.880 --> 50:12.880
You don't have a phone tree, you don't have to leave a voicemail

50:12.880 --> 50:17.880
You don't have to know some sort of secret zero-smashing sequence to get to an operator

50:17.880 --> 50:19.880
They just answer the phone

50:19.880 --> 50:22.880
If you call them between 8am or 8pm on the east coast

50:22.880 --> 50:25.880
It's great, and then they match it all up with a fantastic dashboard

50:25.880 --> 50:27.880
And an awesome online community

50:27.880 --> 50:29.880
But this week, I wanted to do something a little different

50:29.880 --> 50:32.880
You know in LAS, we'll often do an app pick video

50:32.880 --> 50:34.880
But you know, app picks shmat picks

50:34.880 --> 50:38.880
This is Linux Unplugged, let's go deep into the development world

50:38.880 --> 50:41.880
They have a video up of talking with Kerry

50:41.880 --> 50:44.880
The behind the scenes interview with their lead web developer

50:44.880 --> 50:47.880
And I want to play a little bit of it

50:47.880 --> 50:50.880
Because I'm playing it in Chromium

50:50.880 --> 50:56.880
My name is Kerry and I am the interface developer at Ting

50:56.880 --> 51:00.880
My role at Ting is to develop and maintain any customer-facing side of our website

51:00.880 --> 51:02.880
Including WordPress and Facebook

51:02.880 --> 51:04.880
Usually we'll start with a discussion

51:04.880 --> 51:08.880
Product management will come over or ask us if what they want is feasible

51:08.880 --> 51:10.880
Or how much time it'll take

51:10.880 --> 51:14.880
And I will give them an answer, it'll take 10 minutes or it'll take 6 years

51:14.880 --> 51:16.880
Sometimes it will take 6 years

51:16.880 --> 51:19.880
And they go off on their own and come up with the designs

51:19.880 --> 51:21.880
And then they finally, when they give them to me

51:21.880 --> 51:23.880
I set to work on making them a reality

51:23.880 --> 51:26.880
Earlier this year we went responsive with our design

51:26.880 --> 51:30.880
What this means is that when users browse our website

51:30.880 --> 51:34.880
On a smaller screen like a phone or an iPod

51:34.880 --> 51:38.880
They're going to see a different design than if they see it on a big screen like a desktop

51:38.880 --> 51:43.880
We're making sure that users get the best possible experience on all device sizes

51:43.880 --> 51:50.880
It feels really good to be able to be part of something that even our senior citizens can browse comfortably

51:50.880 --> 51:54.880
Because I mean, a lot of senior citizens aren't that comfortable with the internet

51:54.880 --> 51:58.880
And then we get comments from them saying, thanks for making it so easy

51:58.880 --> 52:01.880
And that is a really rewarding part of this job

52:03.880 --> 52:06.880
Linux.ting.com, go over there and start saving right now

52:06.880 --> 52:08.880
They also have a savings calculator

52:08.880 --> 52:12.880
I've been, not quite yet, but I am nearing the 2 year mark

52:12.880 --> 52:17.880
It is approaching and the final savings will be over $2000 for me

52:17.880 --> 52:18.880
So why not get started right now?

52:18.880 --> 52:23.880
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged Show

52:23.880 --> 52:27.880
Okay guys, let's talk, let's do a brief update

52:27.880 --> 52:31.880
Because maybe the real story might actually develop by the time the Linux Action Show comes around

52:31.880 --> 52:33.880
But you probably saw the headline today

52:33.880 --> 52:36.880
The Gnome Foundation is attempting to raise some funds

52:36.880 --> 52:39.880
To help defend Gnome's trademark against Groupon

52:39.880 --> 52:45.880
Yeah, Groupon, the coupon company

52:45.880 --> 52:50.880
They have raised $68,000 as of, well, pretty much this morning

52:50.880 --> 52:52.880
68? 68,000 bucks?

52:52.880 --> 52:55.880
Groupon has also, yeah, yeah, yeah

52:55.880 --> 53:01.880
And Groupon's already responded saying, hey dawg, look, we're sorry, we don't want to use anybody's name

53:01.880 --> 53:04.880
And after additional conversations with the open source community and the Gnome Foundation

53:04.880 --> 53:08.880
We've decided to abandon our pending trademark application for Gnome

53:08.880 --> 53:11.880
We've chosen a new name for our product going forward

53:11.880 --> 53:16.880
So Gnome was this retail box thing that they were going to, so you could go buy coupons

53:16.880 --> 53:18.880
Kind of a neat idea for Groupon

53:18.880 --> 53:22.880
But Pope, you and I were talking about this on the Tech Talk pre-show today

53:22.880 --> 53:23.880
Or actually during the show

53:23.880 --> 53:26.880
Am I missing any details at this point or is that kind of the summary of where we're at?

53:26.880 --> 53:30.880
That seems to be it, it's all over, let's start bashing System D again

53:30.880 --> 53:33.880
Yeah, we're back to, yeah, exactly, yeah, okay

53:33.880 --> 53:38.880
War's over, but it was fascinating to see the troops mobilized last night

53:38.880 --> 53:40.880
So before I went to bed or something, I saw a tweet

53:40.880 --> 53:45.880
And then by the time I got up, the Google Pluses and the tweets and the subreddit

53:45.880 --> 53:49.880
Every subreddit had it in there, like it was full on fire this morning

53:49.880 --> 53:55.880
When you say troops, you know, on a day like today where we're remembering real sacrifice

53:55.880 --> 53:57.880
The real people have done

53:57.880 --> 54:00.880
You are taking my own point I made earlier and using it against me

54:00.880 --> 54:03.880
You are a jerk, sir, you are a jerk

54:03.880 --> 54:06.880
I would not call those troops

54:06.880 --> 54:08.880
Yes, I know, and that's kind of my point

54:08.880 --> 54:11.880
Again, we were just, we were ready to go to war

54:11.880 --> 54:14.880
We were ready to go to war, and they raised a ton of money

54:14.880 --> 54:18.880
I even, I threw in 55 bucks, I was like, well alright, I like Nome

54:18.880 --> 54:20.880
I'm really surprised it's as low as that

54:20.880 --> 54:23.880
I really thought they'd have double that

54:23.880 --> 54:25.880
So what happens with the money now?

54:25.880 --> 54:27.880
It goes to making Nome better

54:27.880 --> 54:30.880
Yeah, they already said that it's going to go to Nome

54:30.880 --> 54:34.880
Anything that's left over, and since all of it's left over, all of it goes to Nome

54:34.880 --> 54:36.880
I think that's worthy

54:36.880 --> 54:41.880
Well that's great because I know they've had some financial troubles, right?

54:41.880 --> 54:43.880
Isn't that a thing?

54:43.880 --> 54:46.880
Oh yeah, they ended last year in the red

54:46.880 --> 54:49.880
Well, I guess they just got a little revenue boost then

54:49.880 --> 54:52.880
But I'm glad, I mean, I think it's

54:52.880 --> 54:59.880
I think it's also, what it really demonstrates, legitimately, is the serious brand loyalty

54:59.880 --> 55:01.880
I don't know if that's the right term to call it

55:01.880 --> 55:05.880
But the, I mean, people came to Nome's defense in mass

55:05.880 --> 55:08.880
And people, I think things have turned around for Nome

55:08.880 --> 55:10.880
I think the public opinion is turning on Nome

55:10.880 --> 55:13.880
Because people really, really seem to come out in defense of it

55:13.880 --> 55:15.880
And we're ready to fight Groupon and calling them names

55:15.880 --> 55:18.880
And Groupon really responded

55:18.880 --> 55:20.880
So not only did they have their official blog post

55:20.880 --> 55:25.880
But their senior lead engineer, I think that's actually his title, senior lead engineer

55:25.880 --> 55:29.880
Went to his blog trying to explain that it was a misunderstanding

55:29.880 --> 55:32.880
That they had been in communication with the Nome Foundation

55:32.880 --> 55:34.880
And that they're willing to be flexible

55:34.880 --> 55:36.880
They really scrambled

55:36.880 --> 55:37.880
I'm not really familiar with

55:37.880 --> 55:40.880
I've seen comments from the Nome side saying

55:40.880 --> 55:44.880
We've been in conversation with them for months and it's only today

55:44.880 --> 55:51.880
Kind of justifying the whole public hatred of Groupon and people deleting their Groupon accounts

55:51.880 --> 55:53.880
I'm not convinced

55:53.880 --> 55:58.880
I'm not convinced that it was entirely down to the Reddit army

55:58.880 --> 56:02.880
And the various armies leaving comments everywhere that got this done

56:02.880 --> 56:05.880
But I'm sure it was a contributing factor

56:05.880 --> 56:06.880
Yeah

56:06.880 --> 56:10.880
I'd like to think that Groupon got a telephone call from Karen Sandler

56:10.880 --> 56:14.880
Where she implied she was going to put the smack down on them

56:14.880 --> 56:15.880
In no uncertain terms

56:15.880 --> 56:16.880
That's what I was thinking too

56:16.880 --> 56:18.880
And they realized what they were up against

56:18.880 --> 56:21.880
Or maybe the people at Groupon grew a pair

56:21.880 --> 56:23.880
And realized that actually they were being dicks

56:23.880 --> 56:28.880
And what they really needed to do was just not do the thing that they were doing

56:28.880 --> 56:33.880
Didn't someone who works at Groupon used to be someone who worked at GNOME?

56:33.880 --> 56:35.880
Oh, now this is a good rumor

56:35.880 --> 56:36.880
Ryan Cameron

56:36.880 --> 56:40.880
Or even more interesting maybe

56:40.880 --> 56:44.880
Using this as a way to show that they now have a new product

56:44.880 --> 56:45.880
Marketing

56:45.880 --> 56:48.880
And everyone kind of knows that they have a point of sale system

56:48.880 --> 56:50.880
You think that

56:50.880 --> 56:51.880
All the truthers are out there

56:51.880 --> 56:54.880
Yeah, I would say that's a pretty obscure marketing strategy

56:54.880 --> 56:55.880
Yeah

56:55.880 --> 56:57.880
It will work though

56:57.880 --> 56:59.880
Everyone now knows what they have

56:59.880 --> 57:00.880
And might actually check it out

57:00.880 --> 57:02.880
Yeah, and I'm actually thinking it's kind of a good idea

57:02.880 --> 57:04.880
Because I don't want to go sign up at Groupon

57:04.880 --> 57:07.880
But if they had a kiosk where I could just do a one-time transaction

57:07.880 --> 57:08.880
Well, maybe I might do that

57:08.880 --> 57:10.880
I mean, I'm a cheapskate after all

57:10.880 --> 57:12.880
They might even look at

57:12.880 --> 57:16.880
People might even look at the GNOME desktop environment now as well

57:16.880 --> 57:18.880
Holy smokes

57:18.880 --> 57:20.880
Maybe they were in on it from the first time

57:20.880 --> 57:22.880
It's a false flag trademark dispute

57:24.880 --> 57:25.880
Operation promotion

57:25.880 --> 57:26.880
I know, right

57:26.880 --> 57:27.880
We've got to

57:27.880 --> 57:28.880
Boy, if we're not careful

57:28.880 --> 57:32.880
We're going to have to bust out the conspiracy bacon on this edition

57:32.880 --> 57:37.880
Yeah, that's funny because that's exactly what Blue Phoenix was saying in the chat room a little bit ago

57:37.880 --> 57:38.880
That there was

57:38.880 --> 57:39.880
It did smell a little bacon-y to him

57:39.880 --> 57:41.880
And I don't think so

57:41.880 --> 57:43.880
I don't think they'd be that dishonest

57:43.880 --> 57:44.880
No, I don't think so either

57:44.880 --> 57:45.880
No, it's a

57:45.880 --> 57:47.880
If they're not though

57:47.880 --> 57:48.880
Kind of you need to question

57:48.880 --> 57:50.880
If they're in conversation in months

57:50.880 --> 57:53.880
Why do you add applications?

57:53.880 --> 57:54.880
Doesn't make sense

57:54.880 --> 57:56.880
Because lawyers do stuff without being told

57:56.880 --> 57:57.880
Yeah, I could see that

57:57.880 --> 58:03.880
Or maybe the negotiations weren't necessarily going the GNOME Projects direction

58:03.880 --> 58:06.880
So they went public to show their serious commitment

58:06.880 --> 58:08.880
I mean there could be all kinds of scenarios

58:08.880 --> 58:09.880
Who knows

58:09.880 --> 58:10.880
Okay

58:10.880 --> 58:11.880
You guys are lovely

58:11.880 --> 58:13.880
And just in huge good faith

58:13.880 --> 58:15.880
Yeah, I suppose

58:15.880 --> 58:16.880
All right

58:16.880 --> 58:17.880
I can't hold it any longer

58:17.880 --> 58:19.880
We've got to talk about something super exciting

58:19.880 --> 58:20.880
Really, really happy

58:20.880 --> 58:22.880
But really quickly we're going to thank Linux Academy

58:22.880 --> 58:27.880
I've got a note from Anthony who is one of the guys that runs Linux Academy

58:27.880 --> 58:32.880
And he said that they've gotten a ton of new signups from the Linux Unplugged audience

58:32.880 --> 58:35.880
And the feedback's been unanimously awesome

58:35.880 --> 58:38.880
And when I went to Ohio Linux Fest

58:38.880 --> 58:41.880
Shook a lot of hands from folks that are taking courses at Linux Academy

58:41.880 --> 58:42.880
And they've been really impressed

58:42.880 --> 58:44.880
And they say one of the things that's kind of hard to understand about Linux Academy

58:44.880 --> 58:46.880
Is you really grok how great it is

58:46.880 --> 58:50.880
And how it really is a solution tailored for Linux users

58:50.880 --> 58:52.880
By Linux users

58:52.880 --> 58:56.880
And that is so key because there's a lot of online learning resources

58:56.880 --> 59:02.880
And you really see the difference if you're trying to go for something in this space

59:02.880 --> 59:07.880
Something about Linux or AWS or OpenStack and DevOps and Android development

59:07.880 --> 59:09.880
They've really nailed this

59:09.880 --> 59:11.880
Because that's what these guys do

59:11.880 --> 59:12.880
That's their area

59:12.880 --> 59:14.880
And they can really get it right

59:14.880 --> 59:16.880
They are these users

59:16.880 --> 59:17.880
They're sysadmins

59:17.880 --> 59:18.880
Linux users

59:18.880 --> 59:20.880
And educators that came together to create Linux Academy

59:20.880 --> 59:23.880
You can go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

59:23.880 --> 59:26.880
And get our special 33% discount on your quarter

59:26.880 --> 59:27.880
It's a great service

59:27.880 --> 59:30.880
And once you sign up you get access to all of the courseware

59:30.880 --> 59:32.880
You get the downloadable comprehensive study guides

59:32.880 --> 59:34.880
You get to take those online or offline

59:34.880 --> 59:36.880
You can do the learning plans

59:36.880 --> 59:38.880
You can say I have just this amount of time available

59:38.880 --> 59:40.880
Plug it in there

59:40.880 --> 59:42.880
They'll generate you a learning courseware on that

59:42.880 --> 59:45.880
With reminders about quizzes, checkups

59:45.880 --> 59:47.880
When you log in you choose your course

59:47.880 --> 59:49.880
And it lays it all out for you

59:49.880 --> 59:51.880
It maps it all out and it's super easy to manage

59:51.880 --> 59:54.880
They have a good active community that can keep you going when you're having a low moment

59:54.880 --> 59:57.880
And they have live streams where you can ask questions to the educators

59:57.880 --> 01:00:00.880
Their labs spin up on demand when the courseware requires it

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.880
And they're adding new courses every single week

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.880
They've got a whole bunch more they just put out

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.880
And that's why you want to just keep going there all the time

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.880
Because you can keep going back and learn something new

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.880
See what scratches that itch

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.880
Bring yourself a little bit further in something you've been working on

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:14.880
I use it honestly

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.880
Just to see if some of the same old technologies that used to be a problem for me

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.880
Still are a problem

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.880
To see if I have maybe a new interest

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:22.880
Something I want to build for JB

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.880
There's all kinds of things

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:25.880
They also have group plans

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.880
So we can have folks in the Jupiter Broadcasting community

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:29.880
That work here that have to do something

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.880
Maybe we have them go over there

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:31.880
They can log in under the group course

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.880
It's all part of one set under one organization

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.880
It's really neat

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.880
They're adding stuff too

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.880
You've got to go check it out

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.880
Because I can't say what it is

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.880
But I've been given a little hint

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:45.880
And it really underscores that this is a product that's made by Linux users

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.880
For Linux users

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.880
And when you're trying to learn some of these things

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.880
That is the differential that really closes the gap

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.880
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.880
Go check them out

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:56.880
PHP

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.880
Android development

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.880
Ruby, Python, Linux, DevOps

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.880
AWS with scenario based training

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.880
They've got it all

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.880
R-Sync even

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.880
You need to go learn how to do your backups with R-Sync

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.880
They've got a course on that

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.880
I'm telling you

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.880
It's worth checking them out

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.880
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.880
So I was noticing on Google Plus

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.880
That Wimpy, you posted that you guys are getting a little attention over in Germany

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.880
In one of their newspapers

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.880
Or I'm sorry, it's a magazine, isn't it?

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:23.880
That's right

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:24.880
Yeah

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.880
Congratulations

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.880
Yeah, thank you for that

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.880
So there's a quarterly Linux publication in Germany

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.880
Called Linux Velt

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.880
I think that's how it's pronounced

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.880
It's got a circulation of about 50 to 60,000

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.880
And they're including DVDs

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.880
Yeah, and they have DVD cover disks

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:45.880
And for the 2015.01 edition

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.880
Which I think is out next week

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:50.880
Ubuntu Mate is the feature story

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.880
And the cover disk

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.880
That is so cool

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.880
And so that's not just the announcement though

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.880
You've been working on a little something

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.880
We talked about it kind of recently

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.880
And so I know you're getting near

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.880
I'm teasing it off a lot, Wimpy

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.880
What process are we about to go through right now?

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:10.880
Right, okay

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:13.880
So everyone probably knows that's listening to this

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.880
That Ubuntu Mate 14.10 was released a couple of weeks ago

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.880
And we've been preparing an Ubuntu Mate 14.04 release

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.880
And I'm actually ready to go through the keystrokes

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.880
To release it live now

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:27.880
So we're going to release the latest version

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.880
Which is based on 14.04

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:30.880
Right here on air

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:31.880
That's right

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:32.880
Let's do it

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:33.880
Right here on air

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.880
This is fun

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.880
So I've got my Terminator sessions open

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:41.880
And I've logged into my two Digital Ocean build servers

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.880
This is where I prepare the ISO images

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.880
I've already prepared the images

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.880
And I'm going to run the release scripts

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.880
And the release scripts build the WebC torrents

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.880
Actually make the ISOs from the SquashFS

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.880
Add the assets from the official Ubuntu CD releases

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.880
And then R-Sync them to my distribution servers

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:04.880
And we'll do that now

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.880
So off we go

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.880
Right, so that's the power of Digital Ocean

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:15.880
That's just shunted six gigabytes of data

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:16.880
Really?

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.880
Wow

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:23.880
We'll now just edit the release flag on the article

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.880
Now we'll run the deploy script

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.880
This is so exciting

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.880
I know, right?

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:31.880
I know

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.880
This is actually the geekiest thing I think we've ever done on the show

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.880
And I love it

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.880
So the deploy script basically takes all the markdown

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.880
That the site is generated from and turns it into HTML

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:41.880
So that's done

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.880
So now I go to my CDN

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.880
And I prefetch all of those images into the CDN

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.880
And that's done

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:55.880
And now I purge the blocks

01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.880
And now I purge the blog index from my Cloudflare

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.880
And that just makes sure that the updates go through

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:08.880
And I think we're done

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.880
So you just witnessed an operating system being released live

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.880
So you pushed the whole website and everything in that

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:17.880
Yeah, there you go

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.880
So if you go to UbuntuMate.org slash blog

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:24.880
The article that you'll see now is the release notes from the article

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.880
UbuntuMate.org slash download

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.880
Yes, that should redirect I think

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.880
Because there's two bits in there

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:33.880
You know what, Wimpy?

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:34.880
You just earned yourself

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.880
Very nice, sir

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.880
Very nice

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:40.880
Thank you very much

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.880
Thank you very much

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.880
Awesome

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.880
Wow

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.880
So I would just like to rattle off this

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.880
There's a few people I'd like to say thank you to

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.880
Some bloke called Alan Pope

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:56.880
Santa Sweers, who's one of the Mate developers who worked really hard on fixing the accessibility stuff

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.880
Mike Gabriel, who's a Debian developer

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.880
He helped an awful lot in this release

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.880
Gerard Alders, who provided one of the new backdrop images

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.880
Some bloke called Michael Tunnel

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.880
I don't know how you pronounce your name, but Rotten Corpse

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:09.880
He's one of the guys here

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.880
He did the new icon theme

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.880
Luke Velvich, Kendall Clark, Kyle Bruard and Rob White

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:22.880
Who represent various distributions that are focused towards the blind off partially sighted

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.880
Who helped fix all of the screen reading stuff

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.880
Wow, great you guys

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.880
And one of the things that's interesting is you were mentioning before

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.880
It's based on Ubuntu 14.04

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:37.880
But yet it actually has some maybe what you might call improvements or feature enhancements

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.880
Over the one based on 14.10, right?

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:40.880
Indeed

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:44.880
So Rotten Corpse has tweaked the theme for us

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.880
Which looks nicer

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.880
We've got a new wallpaper

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.880
We've fixed the multicast DNS

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.880
We've fixed policy kit privileges

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.880
The big feature items are we've added indicator support

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.880
So now you can add indicators into the Mate desktop

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:03.880
And they sit side by side with traditional tray applets as well

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.880
Wow, that's a win

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:08.880
You like that, do you?

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.880
I like that a lot actually

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.880
I'm just interested in how fast that blog post went out

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:21.880
Now what you need to be impressed with is how fast we just pushed 18 gigabytes of data around the internet

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.880
Yeah, as well

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.880
And that's all down to DigitalOcean

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.880
You said it would take about five minutes

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.880
It took about two minutes

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.880
Yeah, I was hedging it on me

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.880
But bungling it enough into redo bits

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.880
A couple of other bits we've added is

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:41.880
The Mint menu I've forked as the Mate menu which is available in this release

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.880
Because lots of people are after that

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.880
And I've actually done that for the X2GO guys

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:53.880
Because they want a menu where they can disable logout and suspend features

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:56.880
Because of remote workstations that doesn't make sense

01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:00.880
I've also forked the Mint desktop utility as Mate tweak or Mate tweak

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.880
To just access some of the behind the scenes bits and pieces

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.880
And then what else have we done?

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.880
Accessibility, that's where we've spent a lot of time, fixing up accessibility

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:12.880
Oh yeah, this is a good one

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:17.880
We've ditched Totem as the default media player and placed it with VLC

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.880
Nice, very nice

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:23.880
We ran a community poll for that and that was unanimously voted for

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.880
So we've made that change

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.880
So I think Eric, you've got probably a popular question

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:33.880
Yeah, since it's based on 14.04 is this going to be basically an LTS as far as you can do it?

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:37.880
Yes, so we obviously don't have to maintain the base OS

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.880
Pope can probably tell you more about what goes on with that

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.880
But in terms of the PPA, because this is an unofficial release

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:48.880
This is built outside of Canonical's infrastructure

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.880
So there's no official support there

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.880
But in terms of the Mate desktop

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:58.880
I'll be supporting that through the PPA that's embedded into this build

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.880
And how long?

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.880
For the duration of the LTS

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.880
So all 5 years, right?

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.880
Yeah, and for anyone that's running 14.10 already

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:15.880
They will have seen some of these features automatically turning up in the updates of their Ubuntu 14.10 releases

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:18.880
Oh man, that is smooth

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.880
I've got to give you a major tip of the hat

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:23.880
What's the long term goal here?

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:27.880
This is obviously going to start developing a pretty passionate following I'd think

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:32.880
I'm already thinking this is the distro of choice for the studio production machines

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.880
That'd be good

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.880
To me it just seems like a slam dunk

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.880
I'm going to give this a download and try it out

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.880
But what's the long term?

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:45.880
Because this could become a pretty big job

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.880
It could become a big job

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:53.880
So the short term is for 15.04 now we want to get it as an official flavor

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.880
So all of that drama of me releasing just then I don't have to do

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:02.880
Somewhere there are monkeys in canonicals infrastructure doing it automatically

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.880
That's handy

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:05.880
So that's the plan

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.880
I've met with some of the Debian developers a couple of weeks ago

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:15.880
And they've agreed to work to the same time frame that Ubuntu is working to for 15.04

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:20.880
So we're not going to introduce Mate 1.10 in 15.04

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:25.880
We're going to do the Mate 1.10 development work in Debian experimental

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.880
And then bring that through in the subsequent release later in the year

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.880
Interesting

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.880
But initially let's get official

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:38.880
Following on from that we've got some serious interest from some large organizations

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:46.880
Who want to use Ubuntu Mate with the X2Go remote terminal services platform

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:53.880
So the desire to get this into Ubuntu and have it as an official flavor

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:59.880
Is a request from some third parties who want to see this happen

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:07.880
Well I think you've got the basis here for a distribution that's going to get a lot of loyal followers

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.880
And the timing is pretty good I think too

01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.880
It's obviously serving a niche

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:18.880
It's so funny too for some reason basing this on 14.04 feels really right

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.880
Like a really smart long term play

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:25.880
And so from end to end it just seems like it's firing on all cylinders

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.880
So congratulations you guys and to everybody who's worked super hard on it

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.880
Thanks very much

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.880
And it's been well being tested by my mum and my wife as well

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.880
So you can be rest assured it works

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:35.880
Okay good

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.880
That's so awesome

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.880
Now see there's some QA for you I've got to say

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.880
Alright well very good

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.880
I just want a couple of notes

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.880
We're still looking for your runs Linux

01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:47.880
You guys send them in throughout the week and I appreciate that

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:48.880
If you have a runs Linux it's even more awesome

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.880
It's either your own thing it could be

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:51.880
Or something you find

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.880
It's total perks if it's got video or a picture

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.880
I'd love that

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.880
That usually puts it towards the top of the list

01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.880
Because those are always fun to look at

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.880
Send those over to linuxactionshow at jupyterbroadcasting.com

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:06.880
Or like all content that you think might be great for either Linux Unplugged or Linux Action Show

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.880
Submit them to our subreddit at linuxactionshow.reddit.com

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:13.880
And don't forget you can join us live jblive.tv

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.880
We do this here on 2pm on a Tuesday

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.880
Go to jupyterbroadcasting.com.calendar to get that converted to your local timezone

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.880
And I'll have links to the Matei stuff in the show notes

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880
So go grab that

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:28.880
Also links to the Gnome vs Groupon stuff in the show notes

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:33.880
And a full break out of the differences between Chrome and Chromium

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.880
So if you were a little confused by our conversation about that

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.880
Because I know some of you are kind of coming into this and saying

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.880
Wait, there's a difference? Yes, there is a difference

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.880
And instead of just sitting here and rattling through all of them

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:45.880
I broke it all out in the show notes for you

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.880
So you can check that out

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.880
And I would be interested to know if anybody has decided to take a Chromium challenge

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.880
I heard from like two people

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.880
Besides also Wimpy now

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.880
So Wimpy you're the third person that took a Chromium challenge

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.880
And you are the third person that's sticking with Chromium

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.880
So I wonder if anybody else tried it and if it didn't go well for you

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880
And what problems you ran into

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:07.880
Send us an email and maybe we'll do a follow up on that next week

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:08.880
Could be kind of interesting maybe

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.880
You know what, I admit, maybe I just am a wild man with the browser

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.880
Alright Matt, well that's going to wrap us up

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:20.880
Now I'll tell you off air my super secret plans for the Linux Action Show on Sunday

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.880
Oh wait Matt, it's big, it's real big

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.880
So we'll talk about that in a little bit

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.880
So tune in on JBLive.tv Sunday

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:30.880
Also, right after the Linux Action Show on Sunday on the live stream

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.880
FoShow 200

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:34.880
We might have something going on

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.880
You can show up live for that if you'd like

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:39.880
FoShow 200 right after the Linux Action Show on Sunday

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.880
Don't forget we want your feedback because it's a huge part of our show

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:43.880
Go over to jubilabroadcasting.com

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.880
Slash contact or click the contact link

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.880
And choose unplugged from the drop down

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.880
Alright everybody, thank you so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux Unplugged

01:12:50.880 --> 01:13:07.880
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:39.880
Alright everybody, JBtitles.com

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.880
Let's pick our title and get out of here

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:46.880
So Popey, are you doing anything for the Ubuntu Summit that starts in a couple of days?

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.880
Oh my god, I am solidly busy

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:50.880
Shave?

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.880
For the next three days

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:52.880
So we won't be hearing you for a little while?

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.880
I need to have a shave

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.880
Popey's going to be AFK

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:59.880
Might have a shower as well

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:07.880
Actually, interestingly, the lunch break, in inverted commas, is at 5 o'clock my time

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.880
Which is the time when you do Tech Talk today

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:12.880
Oh, no kidding

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:15.880
So you're not, I mean really, don't tease, don't tease

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:16.880
No I'm not

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:17.880
That's pretty good

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.880
And what's crazy is you don't have to go anywhere

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:20.880
I'll be busy making burritos

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.880
Yeah, you're going to have to stay

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.880
You know what, if you wanted to stop by and you had a little burrito in your mouth, I would take it

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:28.880
Popey with burrito in the mouth is better than no Popey

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:29.880
Wow

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.880
Wimpy, we need to get together and have a beer at some point to celebrate this

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:34.880
Yeah, congratulations you guys

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.880
All those beers we drank at OddCat just clearly weren't enough

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:39.880
Well that was the investment

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.880
Oh god

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.880
Wow though, that's pretty neat

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.880
Yeah, I've just about dried out, so yeah, I think we should

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:47.880
Yeah, you know
