1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
So, Rotten Corpse is in here, let's, Rotten Corpse here.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,560
So we're in the, you know, pre-show discussion thread, and I'm sitting there grousing about

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,260
the fact that I've done two installations of Ubuntu 16.04 today.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:20,280
One the Mate flavor, and one regular flavor, and I'm downloading Kubuntu 16.04.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,560
And I'm starting to grouse a little bit about the fact that I want Plasma 5.6 as my desktop,

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,980
and there's no reasonable way to get Plasma 5.6 on Ubuntu 16.04.

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:38,020
You have to use either A, Ubuntu 15.10, and then use Neon, or B, wait for the backports

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,120
packages to get updated for 15.10, and download it that way.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,760
But there's really no way to get it for 16.04, because Neon is based on 15.10 right now,

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,440
so it expects 15.10 repos and 15.10 packages to be pre-installed, and 16.04, there's no

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,780
official way, there's no repo out there to get the Plasma 5.6 desktop.

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,360
So I'm sitting here grousing about this, and you know what Rodden Corp says to me?

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,960
He says, that's just a sign of a lack of patience.

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
I disagree.

15
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,960
I disagree.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
I disagree.

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,580
I'm going to go farther than Rodden Corp's and say that Ubuntu and Canonical should probably

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,120
just focus on doing, you know, Unity on.

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,160
Oh, for, they absolutely, well that's what they do.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
That's all they do.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Yeah, that's what they do.

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,160
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,280
I mean, you know, even the community members that are now being supported and stuff, yeah,

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,280
see if they want to, you know, but outside of the project, I would go for that way.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,440
No, here's where I think it's weird, is it's weird to me that something that's the latest

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,760
in development isn't available for something that's in the latest in development.

27
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
I understand why, right?

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,840
Oh, because we haven't had a chance to base it and test it.

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,640
It seems like, it just seems like such an old way of doing software, it feels so weird

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,480
that I want to install the latest version of Ubuntu and I don't get to install the latest

31
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,640
version of a Plasma desktop.

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,760
Like those two things, like I can't believe those two things coexist.

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,960
And if this is not, this is not an impossible problem to solve and other distributions have

34
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,000
solved this problem, some of them fundamentally from the way they're based and others just

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
using other tricks.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,380
It just, it really kind of strikes me as having now, I'm not trying to make this an Arch versus

37
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,440
Ubuntu thing, but now being two years or plus deep into using Arch and then now using Ubuntu

38
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,120
leading up to our review, it really strikes me as a totally old way of doing things, much

39
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,360
like when you go back on a system that uses a really old init system like we're going

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,960
to talk about later today, right?

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,280
It really feels like a super, or like if you install a distribution that doesn't have a

42
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,080
gooey partitioner and you have to use F disk or CF disk, like that's fine.

43
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,600
And you know, okay, I kind of remember how to do that, but it seems like I shouldn't

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,780
have to do that anymore.

45
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,360
So it's not like, it's not a matter of impatience, it just seems like an old model, an old way

46
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,480
of delivering software on a system that is constant, like it's, if 1604 is like as cutting

47
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,920
edges you can get for Ubuntu and you still can't get cutting edge packages on it, I fundamentally

48
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:00,080
understand the mechanics and the reasons why, but to me it seems like we should have solved

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,760
this by now.

50
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,360
There's also another little detail, it's an understanding of marketing.

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,440
I mean, if you are going to try and have a bad experience, even though it's development

52
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,880
and you know it's development, you're going to talk bad about it.

53
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,740
And so they actually have something to protect versus the other, don't necessarily have

54
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,740
that protection.

55
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm not even talking about canonical shipping anything or Ubuntu releasing anything.

56
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,680
I'm just simply coming down to, it's really weird to me that there are packages for some

57
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,540
Ubuntu systems that I can install on some systems.

58
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:44,400
Like for example, I almost guarantee you I could install a Kubuntu 15.10, get all the

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,880
prereqs that I need installed, install Neon, upgrade the son of a bitch to 1604 with Neon

60
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,000
still installed and I bet you it would run just fine.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,360
Like if I just rejigger the approach, if I jump through these hoops appropriately, I

62
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,600
could trick the software into installing through the package manager.

63
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,080
I shouldn't have to do that though, it's weird.

64
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,520
I'm not talking about who's releasing what or what community is supporting what, I'm

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,560
talking about fundamentally this is an old way of managing your software on a Linux box.

66
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,440
It's just weird and it's good by the way that I'm bitching about this now, let me tell you

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
why.

68
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,360
Because I'm getting all of this out of my system before it comes time to actually do

69
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
the review.

70
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,520
So by the time I actually sit down and review Ubuntu 1604, this will be old news to me.

71
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,360
And it's honestly, it's because what I'm doing is because I'm testing the different desktops,

72
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:39,460
I keep redoing installations so I keep setting up from scratch with new installs and I tell

73
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,600
you what, it has been tedious.

74
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:58,480
This is Linux Unplugged episode 138 for March 29th, 2016.

75
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,360
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's been installing distributions

76
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,500
all morning long.

77
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
My name is Chris.

78
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
My name is Wes.

79
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Hey there, Wes.

80
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,240
It has been an install fest here at the JB1 studio.

81
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
It always is.

82
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,240
That's true.

83
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,680
But it's really kicked up into high gear recently.

84
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,440
I've been going through and installing different iterations of Ubuntu 1604 for upcoming review.

85
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,560
Oh my gosh, I got thoughts on that.

86
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,520
But that's not actually what we're here to talk about today.

87
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,820
Coming up on the Unplugged program, we have a whole bunch of updates on some of our favorite

88
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,440
open source projects at the top of the show.

89
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,200
Then I'll give you my tale of ordering the new Ubuntu tablet, the first Ubuntu tablet

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
available for pre-order.

91
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Have you seen this thing?

92
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Yeah.

93
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,420
We're going to talk about that.

94
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:45,200
And then later on in the show, Wes, prepare your body, prepare yourself, Linux distributions

95
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,080
are old news.

96
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,920
We have two brand new Unix eyes, one that is actually based on Linux and one that says

97
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,720
Linux could learn a few things from us.

98
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,900
We're going to give you our thoughts on these two game changers, as they call themselves.

99
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,800
And then later on, towards the end of the show, I've got a little bit of a fast update.

100
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,080
And Wes, you will testify to this.

101
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,180
I had to write it down.

102
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,180
There's so much to cover.

103
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,180
Oh, it's complex.

104
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,180
Right?

105
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,960
I was pen and paper writing this down because I can remember it, you know?

106
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,820
So a lot in the show today.

107
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,840
A lot to cover.

108
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,100
But before we start any of that, we really can go no further without bringing in that

109
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
mumble room.

110
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,720
Time appropriate greetings there, virtual dog.

111
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Hello.

112
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Hello.

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Hello.

114
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
Pip pip.

115
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
Hello.

116
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,940
So I just mentioned a few seconds ago, so you probably heard me say it, that I was installing

117
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,320
me a whole lot of Ubuntu earlier today.

118
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,900
And I got to say, right here, I think the software boutique might be the best thing

119
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,760
to happen to Ubuntu since Ubuntu.

120
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Wow.

121
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
Straight up, full stop.

122
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:56,060
The software boutique, I think it is now going on anything that is Ubuntu-based, regardless

123
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,520
if it is the Mate desktop environment or not.

124
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,120
And Wimpy, I wanted to ask you if you have considered releasing this, I know it must

125
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,720
rely on apt heavily and PPAs.

126
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,000
This could really be a thing.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,240
I mean, this is a great tool.

128
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,320
And so it must be possible to use it on other Ubuntus, correct?

129
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,640
Yes.

130
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:23,560
It's all built using the same tools that power things like the Ubuntu software updater and

131
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,880
stuff like that.

132
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,320
So do I add it as a PPA if I'm on a different spin of Ubuntu, or how does that work?

133
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,640
Well, the software boutique is part and parcel of Ubuntu Mate welcome.

134
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,760
So if you install Ubuntu-Mate-welcome on any Ubuntu, it will just install.

135
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,360
Okay so Ubuntu, I'm doing it right now, it's welcome, see, okay, let's see here.

136
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,040
I have this on this neon machine, let's see, whoa, that's a whole lot of packages it wants

137
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
to pull down there.

138
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,160
Yeah, if you're on a KDE machine, it's going to need a lot of GTK dependencies.

139
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,480
It is though, I have to tell you, when I sit down and I set up a machine, I can launch

140
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,560
the software boutique, what I think is really great about it, Wimpy, is the application

141
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,560
choice is, I don't know if it was you that picked them or who, who picked the applications

142
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
that are featured?

143
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:28,760
So it was myself and Matt Hartley and Luke Corwell, who's the primary developer for software

144
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,480
boutique and welcome now.

145
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
You guys nailed it.

146
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Interesting.

147
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
You guys totally nailed it.

148
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,760
It's just, it's the good stuff and it takes care of all of the clunky PPA stuff in the

149
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,480
background and it's just click, click, click, click and you're going, all right, so my installation

150
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
is done.

151
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,800
So now if I would, would I just run welcome or boutique?

152
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,800
I probably want to run the software.

153
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,680
So you can find either Ubuntu mate welcome or the software boutique in the control center

154
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
hopefully.

155
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,440
I mean it's KDE though so I don't know where you find it but from the terminal, you can

156
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:09,040
run Ubuntu dash mate dash welcome and then hang on, I'm going to give you the secret

157
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
source.

158
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:16,840
So it's Ubuntu dash mate dash welcome space, dash, dash, software dash only.

159
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,840
Ah, okay.

160
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:27,000
Type that in and it is launching and then yeah, okay, software.

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,480
Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

162
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Thank you.

163
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,080
So now I can make this rig even better.

164
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Perfect.

165
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I love it.

166
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
This is such a nice tool.

167
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
It's worth installing all those dependencies for me.

168
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,800
Maybe it should be in one of those app image containers.

169
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,480
Yeah, I described it as it makes installing Ubuntu easier than Antigros, which that's

170
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
really something.

171
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
That's a lot, yeah.

172
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
That's really something.

173
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
But I mean it's one click.

174
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
And that's the whole point.

175
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,760
You know, the whole point is this is supposed to be a low barrier of entry install system

176
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:03,720
of just the stuff you need for people new to Ubuntu or lazy people like me.

177
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,040
So I'm sure everyone in the mumble room and everyone that's listening has done this.

178
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,640
You have a collection of scripts that you can somewhere and when you install a new machine,

179
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,640
you then run a whole swathe of shell scripts which install this and that and configure

180
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,160
things where you want.

181
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,860
And this is taking all of those scripts of things I used to install and just putting

182
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,920
them in one place that anyone can use.

183
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,080
You're sharing them with everyone.

184
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,080
And how does it work?

185
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,920
Why does it work on both 1510 and 1604?

186
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,560
Because when I try to add a PPAs for one, it doesn't work for the other.

187
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,480
So how does that work exactly?

188
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,200
What are you doing on the back end?

189
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:48,160
So on the back end, there's a small database which is just a JSON file called applications.json.

190
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,960
It's very, you know, cleverly named.

191
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,280
And in there, it's a list of all of the applications and it has some properties in there.

192
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:05,080
So it will say something like this piece of software only works on I386 and I864 or this

193
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,480
piece of software is compatible with trusty Wiley and Xenial.

194
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,480
But then it will say on trusty and Wiley use this PPA on Xenial use the official archive.

195
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,820
And on this one, because I'm like on some neon hybrid, it says, OK, it's not available

196
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,820
for this one.

197
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,820
OK.

198
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,400
I try to install it.

199
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,360
The operating system that you're using should be Wiley, right?

200
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
What have you installed?

201
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,520
This here, this is a 1510 with neon and they changed some of the repo stuff.

202
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
Right.

203
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
OK.

204
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,400
So that will work as though it's Wiley.

205
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Yeah.

206
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,880
So, for example, if there's stuff that hasn't been released for Xenial yet, you won't see

207
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,240
it in the 1604 version, but you will see it in the Wiley version.

208
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,240
Yeah.

209
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,120
And it looks like my GTK theme.

210
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,840
So whatever desktop theme I'm using, it looks it looks nice.

211
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,560
It looks actually really good under plasma to a surprise.

212
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,040
Yeah, it really isn't offensive.

213
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:05,860
It's really and if you run if you run welcome itself, there's a little button in the top

214
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:11,800
of welcome where it's going to also appear in the software boutique as well to say subscribe

215
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,600
to updates.

216
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,520
And what that does is that actually keeps your version of welcome and the software boutique

217
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,960
in step with the absolute latest stuff as new applications become available.

218
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,840
So when, for example, Oracle release VirtualBox Xenial, that will turn up in the software

219
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,800
boutique for you and other things like that will just sort of come online as the support

220
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
gets added.

221
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,960
Isn't that a nice tool when you're on a new distro like that and stuff isn't completely

222
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,760
ready at launch, that is just show up when it's ready.

223
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,560
I would argue that it shouldn't be a problem in the first place, but you know, that is

224
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
actually pretty good.

225
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,160
I would say that.

226
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,360
So I just wanted to say thank you because it was a heck of a tool for me today as I

227
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,160
was setting up three different Ubuntu rigs and now I just put it on a plasma desktop.

228
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
So there you go.

229
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
It works from all over.

230
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
You can use it anywhere.

231
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Yeah, you really can.

232
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
You really can.

233
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
All right.

234
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,280
So before we go too much further, I should mention we are enjoying ourselves a Fremont

235
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,080
interurban do you think, Wes?

236
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
IPA.

237
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,760
Well, there you go.

238
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
Because beer matters.

239
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,640
So that's our – so if you in the lug there have yourself some beverage, you can crack

240
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
it open now.

241
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,180
There it is.

242
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,180
And that's what we'll be enjoying.

243
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,040
It is ranked at 86 which is pretty good, very good actually.

244
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
And it has a –

245
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Just a few minutes south.

246
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Yeah?

247
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
Really?

248
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Down in Fremont in Seattle.

249
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,560
Oh, they've been that free.

250
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,600
You have been nailing the local beers lately.

251
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,080
I do what I can.

252
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,760
Are you doing that on purpose, Wes?

253
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Maybe.

254
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,760
A little local flair.

255
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,040
You know what would be great?

256
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
We should treat the guys when they come out for Linux Fest.

257
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Mm-hmm.

258
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
All right.

259
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
We'll save that for the Linux Fest talk coming up.

260
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
All right.

261
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Let's do some updates.

262
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,400
This one caught both Wes and my attention today and we're like, okay, this might be

263
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,160
something worth talking about.

264
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,600
There is hubbub coming out from Mary Jo Foley over at All Things About Microsoft at the

265
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,160
ZDNet talking about day one of build Microsoft might announce an Ubuntu-based bash shell

266
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,720
running on top of Windows 10.

267
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,720
What?

268
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Yeah.

269
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,080
It seems that bash on Ubuntu will figure in somehow.

270
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Bash is a Linux shell, she mentions.

271
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
I don't know if you knew that.

272
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
Did you know that?

273
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
No.

274
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
I was going to ask.

275
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
I'm glad you said.

276
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
Stands for the born shell.

277
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
She says.

278
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
That's what she says right there.

279
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Stands for, and it has plugins, she says.

280
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
Ooh.

281
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,560
I love it when Mary Jo, who I respect, is trying to cover a Linux technology.

282
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
That's right.

283
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
She just is so often.

284
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
That's good though.

285
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
She's doing a good job.

286
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
To employ text commands.

287
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Yes.

288
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
I love that ability.

289
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Thanks, Bash.

290
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,840
So as someone has noted on Twitter today, there's already ways of getting bash shell

291
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,400
of course running on Windows, which was news to Mary Jo, which of course as we all know

292
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,640
is Sigwin, but Microsoft has been brewing on something that goes a step beyond that.

293
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,120
In Redstone builds, which are new builds of Windows 10 spotted recently, there was a Linux

294
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,880
subsystem added to Windows 10, a Linux subsystem in the new builds of Windows 10, and so we

295
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,760
might find very soon at the build conference, which is, I don't know, coming up soon.

296
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
Doesn't really matter.

297
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,220
Coming up soon, the build 26 developer conference, we may see them launch Bash based on Ubuntu

298
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,480
on Windows 10.

299
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,440
Popey, are you switching?

300
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,960
From what to what?

301
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:26,760
Well now you can have your Ubuntu command line with your Windows 10 desktop environment.

302
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
What else do you need?

303
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,760
Cortana.

304
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Yeah, yeah.

305
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,760
Cortana.

306
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,760
Yeah.

307
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,520
So I could say to Cortana, RM minus RF slash.

308
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
I hope so.

309
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,680
I hope they, I mean if they're dumb enough to put that stupid Tay AI robot online, they

310
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,680
might be dumb enough to make it that easy.

311
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,440
You know, speaking, I mean, not to pile up on Microsoft right now, but can we just take

312
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,120
a minute and just talk about how out of touch they are?

313
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,360
Like the idea that the reason why, the idea that them putting a bash shell on Windows

314
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,800
is what's going to keep me developing on Windows is kind of adorable.

315
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,200
And it just shows how disconnected they are from what people actually want.

316
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,280
Much like this commercial about the Microsoft cloud helping the digital crimes unit fight,

317
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,360
you guessed it, cyber crime.

318
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Check this thing out.

319
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,080
The biggest challenge for business today is not competition.

320
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,520
Okay, the biggest challenge is what?

321
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Cyber crime.

322
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,600
You got it, buddy.

323
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,360
It's protecting customer trust.

324
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,400
Every day you read headlines about governments and businesses being hacked, emails compromised,

325
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,080
and intellectual property being stolen.

326
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,080
That is cyber crime and it affects each and every one of us.

327
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,600
So how do we fix this?

328
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Cloud dude.

329
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Oh.

330
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,280
Microsoft created the digital crimes unit to investigate and fight cyber crime.

331
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
They don't have any big screens right now.

332
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,600
They use the Microsoft cloud to visualize information so we can track down the criminals.

333
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,400
So they use the cloud to visualize information so they can track down criminals.

334
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,280
And what they're showing here is a huge screen, which is literally sitting in front of a huge

335
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
screen.

336
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Do you see that?

337
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Are these bigger or smaller than this Fox News giant screen?

338
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
They're about the same size.

339
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,800
But do you see what they literally are doing is they are literally standing in front of

340
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:17,180
a screen that is blocking their field of view, which is then in front of it another larger

341
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,400
screen that they probably literally cannot even see while they're doing pinch to zoom

342
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,800
on a cloud powered map because they have cloud.

343
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,420
We use the Microsoft cloud to visualize information so we can track down the criminals.

344
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:35,280
Using our advanced analytics tools, analysis that used to take days to run, we can now

345
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,480
see in real time.

346
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,800
And we're building what we learned back into the cloud to make...

347
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,620
So here's what else is really weird is you notice how they keep zooming in on the United

348
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,620
States.

349
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,560
Like they keep showing cities and stuff in the US like they're watching the United States

350
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
traffic.

351
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,760
But I guess, you know, when you have the cloud, you're everywhere.

352
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,480
Back into the cloud to make people and organizations safer.

353
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,520
When it comes to the cloud, trust and security are paramount.

354
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,560
Our passion is making life tougher for cybercriminals and making it safer for you and your customers.

355
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,400
Microsoft come run Ubuntu on our cloud.

356
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Don't let that baby on the internet.

357
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,880
Like that's what's so great about the Microsoft cloud is that more and more it's used to run

358
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
Linux.

359
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
So yeah, have that at everybody.

360
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Isn't that great?

361
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
Yep.

362
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Yeah.

363
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:29,080
Honestly, the company that's got the most egregious terms of use and YOLO out there

364
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,880
that is totally designed to invade your privacy at the drop of a hat is trying to pitch their

365
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,400
cloud platform as the opposite of that.

366
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,900
Wimby, I would ask you this one basic question.

367
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,160
Where do you think they're getting all of the metrics that they use to visualize and

368
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,640
put back into the Microsoft cloud to hunt cybercrime?

369
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,040
Where do you suppose those metrics come from?

370
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,000
I can't imagine.

371
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Exactly.

372
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Yeah.

373
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Hmm.

374
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah.

375
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Hmm.

376
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah.

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I wonder where that is.

378
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,240
They also have a new other upside, which is the telcos are moving to put their infrastructure

379
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,720
on quote unquote cloud.

380
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,300
And they're pretty much actually hiring a lot.

381
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,840
If you look at most of the mobile companies and telcos are hiring people for cloud development

382
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,160
of their infrastructure technology.

383
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
Yeah.

384
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Cloud.

385
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Yeah.

386
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Okay.

387
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,920
We're not going to spend a lot of time on this, but there is a significant amount of

388
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,520
game news updates to do really briefly that we're just going to spend a couple of moments.

389
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,220
And the first one is partially because it takes me back to when I finally had to save

390
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,480
up my own money to get my own first Matrox graphic card.

391
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,360
And this Matrox graphics card had this expandable RAM module to go up to like eight megabytes

392
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
of RAM.

393
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
No way.

394
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
Or four megs maybe.

395
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
I can't remember.

396
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,440
That forever changed my gaming.

397
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Tomb Raider.

398
00:19:48,440 --> 00:20:08,440
And now it's coming to Linux again.

399
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:19,880
So much has happened.

400
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm super excited about this game just because I've been wanting to play a Tomb Raider game.

401
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Our captain is injured.

402
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,040
Have you heard from any of the others?

403
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Nothing.

404
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
Takes me way back.

405
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
Our crew is exhausted.

406
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
It sure does.

407
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,920
I have a bad feeling about this.

408
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,940
So Tomb Raider is coming out for the Linux desktop soon.

409
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,880
And we don't have a date yet, but we have details in the show notes that say reboot

410
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,920
is going to hit Linux and Steam OS this spring is the guesstimated ship date, so stay tuned

411
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,180
for that.

412
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,960
Another game coming out, Two Worlds 3, which is in development, and Two Worlds 2 is coming

413
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
to Linux.

414
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
That's only a little confusing.

415
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
Right.

416
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,800
Two Worlds 3, which is likely to come to Linux, which is in development, and Two Worlds 2,

417
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,200
which is getting an engine remake, graphics assets, a new DLC is coming to Linux.

418
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
So that's a game coming.

419
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,040
And then another game that's actually hit public beta right now, hitting Linux within

420
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,960
the last week, is Darkest Dungeon, which is a roguelike turn-based RPG, which just got

421
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,040
its public beta.

422
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,160
And I will just give you a brief taste of what it's like.

423
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:30,240
There is a great horror beneath the manor, a crawling chaos that must be destroyed.

424
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:40,400
The task ahead is terrible, and weakness cannot be tolerated.

425
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,480
So that's Darkest Dungeon, and the public beta is out right now.

426
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
So there you go.

427
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,520
Oh, and one more, Payday 2, which has had a bit of controversy in the past, has hit

428
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,640
Steam OS and is going free for the rest of March to play online.

429
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,300
And they're doing it specifically to celebrate the Steam OS launch.

430
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:02,280
So if you want to throw a little love, nothing out of pocket, I don't think, to get Payday

431
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,100
2, at least not for the online play.

432
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,440
So there you go.

433
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,880
That concludes your Valve Steam game Linux proprietary gaming update.

434
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Faster than ever.

435
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Yeah.

436
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,560
I tried to bust through it super fast for those of you who don't care.

437
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,000
One more little thing, though, kind of gaming-related.

438
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,280
Ferronix has a pretty good comparison right now of AMD graphics cards versus Nvidia graphics

439
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
cards using Vulkan.

440
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Oh, really?

441
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,000
Yeah, and early game reports on Vulkan coming in now.

442
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,560
So if you are curious about that, Ferronix has that.

443
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
You can go check that out.

444
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,960
Yeah, I want to play games.

445
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
I just want to play games.

446
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,880
But we've got to get real for a second.

447
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,840
I don't normally mention alpha releases as an open source, like, project follow-up thing,

448
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,700
but I am going to mention Fedora 24 alpha, which shipped today, and only because it sort

449
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,000
of codifies something that we already knew well in advance, and that is that Wayland

450
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,280
will not be shipping as default in Fedora 24.

451
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,080
They read here, we've decided not to make Wayland the next generation graphics stack

452
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,160
the default in Fedora 24 workstation.

453
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,240
However, Wayland remains available as an option, and the workstation team would greatly appreciate

454
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,280
your help in testing.

455
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,980
Our goal is one full release where the non-default Wayland option works seamlessly or reasonably

456
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,320
close to that, and at that point, we'll make Wayland the default with X11 as the fallback.

457
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:24,680
Here's my question, mumble room, does this mean we will not have a mainstream Linux distribution

458
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,240
shipping with Wayland in 2016, as in another year will pass without Wayland shipping as

459
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,560
the default on a mainstream distribution?

460
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,640
It's possible.

461
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Yeah, I think it does mean that, doesn't it?

462
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,640
I think it just means we just clocked another year without Wayland.

463
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Now, if Mir could close the gap, the year of Mir has been doing its work well.

464
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,400
If we use the year of 2016 to polish it up, obviously that's worth it.

465
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
I'm just pointing it out.

466
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,680
It's just worth maybe mentioning.

467
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,480
It's funny to realize that when it's still only March.

468
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,280
It's good for things like SteamOS, right?

469
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,320
I don't think it was ever going to be a problem for SteamOS.

470
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,220
They would have hung out on X probably for a while, but you're right, anytime you can

471
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,160
refine the process and get it better and get another year of driver development in.

472
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
That's probably good.

473
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,000
If we can make the switch that much better, more seamless.

474
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,160
Of course, there's going to be distros out there you could load.

475
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Well, today.

476
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,480
Right, you could use it today.

477
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,440
We're only a week into NVIDIA supporting Wayland on their proprietary driver.

478
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,760
This is probably a good idea.

479
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,080
Also, if you go down to the alpha, you can get your hands on GNOME 3.20.

480
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
2.0.

481
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,880
Yeah, you get the new GNOME, which would be pretty nice, a good way to get that.

482
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,160
It looks like overall a pretty cool alpha, and they mentioned you may have some issues

483
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
with old themes.

484
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:51,880
But yeah, I just thought that was... I bet everyone, aw, okay, okay, yeah, okay, no Wayland,

485
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,880
no Wayland.

486
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:00,120
Also, speaking of updates from distributions, Arch has a doozy, which... Hey, Rekai, note

487
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
this one down, okay?

488
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,120
I better let Rekai know because we got some servers here we got to update.

489
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,560
Pac-Man needs to be updated on your Arch box before April 23rd, and I'm going to be too

490
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,120
busy at LinuxFest to remind you guys, so you got to stay on top of this yourself.

491
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,360
This is Chris helping you out right now.

492
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,600
In order to use the new hooks, the new fancy hooks, they say, we require all users to update

493
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:29,200
the latest Pac-Man 5.0.1 before April 23rd, 2016, which, by the way, guys, has been out

494
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
since February 23rd.

495
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
So get your freaking updates on.

496
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Dash SYU already.

497
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,480
You're getting two months, so get on it, otherwise you're going to be in a world of hurt.

498
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,200
You're going to have to probably go download that stuff manually.

499
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
So there you go.

500
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Oh, thanks.

501
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Wait, really, Rekai?

502
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Really?

503
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,320
Oh, he says he already did it.

504
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,320
Look at that, Rekai.

505
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
Good man.

506
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,920
Man, that guy, he gets an internet cookie.

507
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,920
Hello, everybody.

508
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,800
Well, that's the best I got for right now.

509
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,120
That's the best I got.

510
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
So there you go.

511
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Go update your Arch boxes.

512
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,840
The first thing I thought of is, oh, no big deal, and then I looked over, you see that

513
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,120
machine we have running right there?

514
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Yes, I do.

515
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,460
GNOME 3 desktop running on Arch, that runs OBS and VLC and NGINX and fancy stuff to do

516
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,560
internal RTSP streams.

517
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:15,920
I haven't updated that thing since like December, I think, maybe January.

518
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
What are you doing this afternoon?

519
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,920
Yeah.

520
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Yeah.

521
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
Well, the problem is that I break it when I do the updates.

522
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,240
Then I have to be like, Rekai, come fix it.

523
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,920
I don't have time to fix OBS because it's usually the NGINX installer or something that

524
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,920
breaks.

525
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
You know what I need to do?

526
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,800
I need to shut that knockoff and move it over to a DigitalOcean droplet.

527
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,520
Oh, DigitalOcean, sponsor right here on the Linux unplugged program.

528
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,760
Here's our promo code DOUNPLUGGED over at DigitalOcean.

529
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
Use it.

530
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
See out there?

531
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
DOUNPLUGGED.

532
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,080
You got to turn off a knock and just go spin up a droplet.

533
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,280
Less than 55 seconds, you'll have a machine that's ready to go, and they start at only

534
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:54,200
$5 a month or 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one blazing fast CPU, and a terabyte

535
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
of transfer.

536
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
That's the starting price.

537
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,760
It only gets better from there.

538
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,760
It does, and they're all SSDs, and the bandwidth transfer just gets more.

539
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,920
It's a really great, simple-to-use cloud hosting service.

540
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,240
You can go spin up your own Linux rig.

541
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,400
They got Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, FreeBSD if you want that.

542
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,720
They got CoreOS, because why not?

543
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,600
Go put it in a Docker container or a rocket thingy or whatever, Alex.

544
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
I don't care.

545
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Just go do it, right?

546
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,600
Go do it.

547
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,060
You know, we've been seeing a lot of people saying, hey, do you guys want to create a

548
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,040
how-to guide on installing own cloud?

549
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,120
Just go over to DigitalOcean and just click the one-click deployment, and what's great

550
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,720
about it is like if you screw up your own cloud installation, like you just mess it

551
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,440
all up, you can go back and redeploy that base image again, and it's right back.

552
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
Own cloud installed.

553
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Ubuntu's installed.

554
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
Good to go.

555
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
It's like, okay, that wasn't so bad.

556
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
Put your data back in.

557
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
Bob's your uncle.

558
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,660
They have a great interface, a really nice intuitive API that you can write around or

559
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,960
just take advantage of some of the open source code that's already out there, a community

560
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,720
tutorial section that is, honestly, it beats everybody out there, tons of really great

561
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,800
help out there.

562
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,560
So not only do they have the one-click applications, but if you just want to do a basic rig and

563
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,780
just set it up yourself or you want to build on top of it, really good tutorial.

564
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:13,080
So just use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED at a $10 credit, support the show, and spin yourself

565
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080
up a droplet.

566
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,200
DigitalOcean.com, data centers all over the world.

567
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
Check them out at DigitalOcean.

568
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,400
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big thank you to DigitalOcean.

569
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Thank you.

570
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Hey, DO.

571
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Thanks, man.

572
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Thank you.

573
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:31,040
I'm pretty excited about this, only I have been pulling my hair out about this new Ubuntu

574
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,740
M10 tablet.

575
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,860
So there's two versions right now.

576
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:41,000
There's the HD version, the 1920 by 1080, and then there's a, quote, unquote, HD version,

577
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,640
which is more like 720p.

578
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:49,640
And I think it was announced yesterday for pre-order, coming from BQ.

579
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,560
It's the Ubuntu M10 Aquarius, Ubuntu edition, or whatever.

580
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,320
Going to have 16.04 on it, probably shipping in March, April-ish.

581
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,320
No.

582
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
No?

583
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
Not 16.04.

584
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,320
No.

585
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,560
Current build, it'll be OTA 10, which is based off Vivid, so that's 15.04, but we'll move

586
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,560
to 16.04 soon.

587
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,720
You know, they say 16.04 in the product marketing there.

588
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Oh, dear.

589
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
But-

590
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,440
It's interesting, because I saw it say 15.10, actually.

591
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,240
Well, I'm talking about just right here in the imagery.

592
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,160
I don't know about in the actual specs.

593
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:29,280
You know, either way, I mean, that's sort of not the big point.

594
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,280
That's not the big story.

595
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,560
The big story is, it's our first crack at ordering an official Ubuntu tablet.

596
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,120
That's the story, right?

597
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,120
That's pretty exciting.

598
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,320
Poby, are you, tell me, do you have to buy it yourself, or are you just going to be getting

599
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,680
one, or how does that work?

600
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:50,600
So, for some, looking around me, I have a bunch of devices that I have been given, but

601
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,440
I do buy my own as well.

602
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,200
So I like to know what the consumer experience is.

603
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:04,360
So I have two machines side by side, and I have one that's running the latest stable

604
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,800
and one that's running unstable, so I can tell and compare and contrast.

605
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,960
So yeah, I'll probably end up buying myself one.

606
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,840
I might get one from work, but I'll probably buy myself one anyway.

607
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,120
I don't know what my problem is, but I can't get my order to go through.

608
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
I don't know if other people-

609
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
Actually, I heard from somebody else-

610
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,520
Bad credit, Chris.

611
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,960
Somebody else on Twitter is having this problem, but I put my order in, I put my shipping address,

612
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,040
I created my account, and then when I click on place order, the page just refreshes and

613
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:41,560
it goes from $299 to $799, or it actually goes from $299.90 to $799 price, and then

614
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,440
I hit proceed to check out just to see what happens, and it just – nothing happens.

615
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
It never proceeds.

616
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,160
I can't actually proceed to place an order, and I've tried for the last couple of days.

617
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:53,320
So I have not been able to order one yet, but I definitely want to get one.

618
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,640
I think it would be – I don't know.

619
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,160
Have you heard, Poppy, about how many there are?

620
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,880
Am I going to run out if I don't get an order in soon?

621
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,280
What's the word there?

622
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,280
I don't know, actually.

623
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,760
I don't know how many they're planning to manufacture.

624
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,720
Usually when it's a pre-order, the fact that you're ordering them means that they take

625
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,440
those numbers and manufacture a certain number for the demand, but no, I don't know.

626
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,920
I've not seen that problem at all.

627
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,080
So I've heard from only one other person that's having the problem.

628
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,400
This has got a 1.3 gigahertz quad-core MediaTek ARM processor in there, 10.1-inch screen,

629
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,520
8-megapixel camera, it looks like, and this is going to be the one that gives us convergence,

630
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
right?

631
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,520
This will be a tablet that you can hook up to a keyboard and mouse and have a full desktop

632
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,520
experience.

633
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Oh, that's awesome.

634
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
Yep.

635
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,520
And you can either use the internal display or – it's got a mini HDMI port, so you can

636
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,960
just plug in an external display if you want a bigger display.

637
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
That's a big feature.

638
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
You can use internal or external.

639
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,560
That isn't being talked about that much.

640
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Mini HDMI, you mean?

641
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Well, just –

642
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Yeah.

643
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Yeah.

644
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
The convergence aspect of it, that's why I want to get my hands on it.

645
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Right.

646
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,560
I want to try it.

647
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Yeah.

648
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
I really want to try it because I think that's going to be –

649
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
That makes it a lot more interesting.

650
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,160
And plus, not only do I want to try it, but I'm sure it's going to be something that's

651
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,440
going to be iterated on for years, or at least for a while.

652
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,520
And so I want to see it as that process matures, as that experience matures.

653
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,880
And so that's why I want to get one, but for goodness sakes, I can't get the order in no

654
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,880
matter what I do.

655
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
I do not know.

656
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
Yeah.

657
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,440
I've also tried it in Chrome and Firefox.

658
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,800
I've tried it with no ad blocks turned on.

659
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,600
I'm just really happy they didn't cut the corners with the display in order to get at

660
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,480
that price point because when I saw that it was full HD, I'm like, oh, this is an absolute

661
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
buy.

662
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
Oh, really?

663
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,000
You're not worried about maybe applications that you don't want that aren't available

664
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
or something like that?

665
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
No.

666
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
That will be solved with time.

667
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Yeah.

668
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And plus, there's a lot of Linux apps that you might want to play with, right?

669
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yeah.

670
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Anybody in the Mumble Room order one of these?

671
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I have.

672
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Oh, okay.

673
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Wimpy, what was your reasoning?

674
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,440
Other than just obviously interest?

675
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:03,720
Yeah, also, I had the BQ5 phone, which I bought.

676
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,360
I've since given that to a friend of mine so that they can experiment with Ubuntu.

677
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,480
And I've been using the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 7.

678
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,800
And a bit like you were just saying, I want a proper device that's going to be supported

679
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,920
for some time.

680
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:28,200
And I'm really wanting to see how this works on the road as a portable device that I can

681
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,800
take with me and do useful things on.

682
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:36,440
Because I think, Popey, am I right about this, Firefox and LibreOffice are going to be installed

683
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,080
by default on these?

684
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
Maybe.

685
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,080
I don't know.

686
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,800
I remember reading at some point that those were going to be pre-installed applications.

687
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,880
So when you go into the windowed mode, you've got those sort of productivity tools.

688
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,480
Popey, how does that work?

689
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,400
Is it BQ that delivers the final image?

690
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,900
No, we build the image and it's exactly the same as it is for all the other devices.

691
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,400
We build the image, we do QA and then we pass it to BQ.

692
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,900
They do their QA and then they integrate that into their factory process.

693
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,600
So at the point when they manufacture the devices, the image that gets deployed onto

694
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,720
them is the image that we made.

695
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,240
And if that's true that LibreOffice and Firefox are going to be working on this, then that

696
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,040
also means that it's shipping applications that require XMirror to be fully functional

697
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
by default.

698
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Correct?

699
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Yes.

700
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
Yes.

701
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
They use XMirror.

702
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
Yeah.

703
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
You got the same problem?

704
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
Except a different number.

705
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,820
So Wes just tried to buy it to see if he had the same problem I got and he has the same

706
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,600
problem only he got $599, I got $799.

707
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,320
We can't proceed with the checkout.

708
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,280
You're living in the filthy colonies and not over in enlightened Europe.

709
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,760
I'm sure, but it says worldwide delivery, right?

710
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,320
It says worldwide delivery, doesn't it?

711
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
Yeah.

712
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,320
Yeah.

713
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
Neither one of us can place an order.

714
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,320
So both of us are trying.

715
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,480
I've wondered if I should just buy the regular Aquarius and could find the image available.

716
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
Is that likely?

717
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
How's that going to work?

718
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,080
I know this is sort of looking into the crystal ball a little bit, but are there going to

719
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,080
be images I can download down the road and just install on it if I want to?

720
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,080
Yeah.

721
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,000
All our images are the same for all of the devices.

722
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
They're already available.

723
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
You can already go and-

724
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Oh, they are?

725
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
They're not device-specific?

726
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yeah.

727
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,240
They are device-specific, but they're on the same server as all the other devices.

728
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,860
You could go rummage and find them.

729
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:39,600
They wouldn't be the final image because the final image isn't done yet, but you could

730
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,840
go and get the image.

731
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:45,480
I'm not guaranteeing that you could go and buy an Android version of that device and

732
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,120
flash it because that's somewhat out of our control.

733
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,240
If they put some lock on it or make it difficult to do, I don't know.

734
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,480
Or changed firmwares or something like that.

735
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Right.

736
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,080
And that's beyond our control.

737
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,840
So we always say, if you buy the Ubuntu one, we know we can reflash that, but we just don't

738
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
know about the Android one.

739
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:07,800
But past experience, we have had people who bought the Android version of the BQ phones

740
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,240
and then asked BQ for the flashing tool that allows them to flash them to Ubuntu and BQ

741
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
have provided it.

742
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
So it's-

743
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,240
Wow.

744
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
That's a good time.

745
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,240
It's out of the realms of possibility.

746
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
They do have good support at BQ.

747
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
I like that.

748
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,240
I like hearing that.

749
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
I don't know.

750
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,480
Does anybody else have any thoughts or questions about the tablet before I just selfishly change

751
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,480
tracks for a moment?

752
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,480
No?

753
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,480
Okay.

754
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,560
If anyone can buy it, just plus one for Chris.

755
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
Yeah.

756
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Right.

757
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Okay.

758
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,680
Maybe, Poby, you might be the best guy to ask.

759
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,240
Maybe somebody else might know.

760
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,520
How likely is it down the road that if I were to eventually wind up with a Nexus 5X that

761
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,480
I would be able to run Ubuntu Touch on that?

762
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
Right now, I'm looking at it.

763
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,800
It seems like the most powerful phone I could get to run Ubuntu Touch would be the OnePlus.

764
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,000
I don't really have any interest in the OnePlus.

765
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,400
I'd rather have a Nexus device.

766
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,420
Am I SOL theoretically down the road or is there likely eventually going to be a community

767
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:00,040
edition or maybe even official build for the newer Nexus I?

768
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,680
So it's a good question.

769
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,520
We've got a community porting campaign on at the moment.

770
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:16,960
And if you go to ubports.com, I think it is, ubports.com, there's like a wish list of devices

771
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,040
that people want ported to.

772
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,560
And the OnePlus One is only already done because that was done some months ago.

773
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,920
The guy who did that, Mario, who did that a while ago, and it turns out that the internals

774
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,740
of the OnePlus One and the Two and the OnePlus X are fairly similar.

775
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,600
So actually, he can reuse some of that work.

776
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:45,440
The devices that are wish lists that you'd really like probably aren't being ported because

777
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,120
A, he doesn't have the time and he's just one guy.

778
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,620
And B, he may not even have that device.

779
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:54,920
So he asks for donations if we want to give him, you know, chuck him a few dollars, then

780
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
he'll buy it.

781
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,920
Interesting.

782
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,000
And I know he has done that, like someone threw him some money.

783
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,960
So he went and bought a OnePlus X, and then I saw a message on Google Plus with a photo

784
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,800
of a OnePlus X running Ubuntu.

785
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,640
So you know, as soon as he has the device, he starts working on it.

786
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,680
But he has now a queue of devices to work on and he is only one guy.

787
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:19,280
If you know anyone who is familiar with porting, like cyanogen type porting from the XDA developers

788
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,040
type community, if they want to get involved and start porting to some of these other devices,

789
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,280
like Nexus devices, that would be awesome and put him in touch with Mario.

790
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
It seems-

791
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
5X is on there.

792
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Not funded.

793
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
Yeah.

794
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,120
It seems like I'm having more and more conversations with people where they say, from now on I'm

795
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,400
only buying Nexus devices.

796
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,400
And that's not to put down like the OnePluses or the S7s or anything like that, but people

797
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
are just like, um.

798
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,880
That's about all I consider on it.

799
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,880
I mean, maybe a Moto X.

800
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,880
Yeah.

801
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,820
But I've been, it's funny how often I've been having this conversation.

802
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,260
And I think a lot of people are coming to this as they look at the smartphone market

803
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,900
is if you're going to go Android and you're technically savvy and you want direct security

804
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:01,240
updates from Google, you just go Nexus right now.

805
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:07,900
And so if Ubuntu, though I'll just say Touch, got to the point where it was, it got to the

806
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:13,040
point where if you, like where Linux used to be for laptops a decade ago where you could

807
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,680
take a pretty mainstream distro and if you got a fairly mainstream, well not even ten

808
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,440
years ago, five years ago, if you got a fairly mainstream laptop, you had a great shot of

809
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,660
getting Ubuntu to work on that, it'd be really something now.

810
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:28,760
If you got a Nexus device, you'd have a pretty great shot of knowing you'd also be able to

811
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
run Ubuntu on it.

812
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
Man.

813
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:36,280
That, it would be such a great place for Ubuntu to get to for those devices just, because

814
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,120
it'd just become another option to run on a Nexus device.

815
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,820
And it starts to make the Nexus device look less like a Google phone and more like a general

816
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,600
smartphone platform that you could just load all their OS's on.

817
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
And that's pretty neat.

818
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Good hardware, good price.

819
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,600
More like traditional PC hardware where you can.

820
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Exactly.

821
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
Something to standardize.

822
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Decent hardware, good price.

823
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Yeah.

824
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Yeah.

825
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
I mean it's reasonable.

826
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Kitson, you wanted to jump in.

827
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Go ahead.

828
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,440
The reason that I will only purchase a Nexus device is because the support.

829
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,600
With a Nexus device, I know I'm getting at least two years of support.

830
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:15,640
And why am I going to spend, you know, $700 on a device that may or may not receive updates?

831
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:23,360
And then on top of that, like if I go to the Samsung Galaxy S website, I can't find out

832
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:27,880
if I purchased this device, how long they're actually going to support it.

833
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,880
It's not in.

834
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,880
They're not interested in committing to that.

835
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,880
No, no.

836
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,880
See, the interesting thing here is you've all been tainted by the problem of Android.

837
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,220
Is that the thing that has made you do that is the ecosystem around Android that's forced

838
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,640
you to all make that decision.

839
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,840
You shouldn't have had to make that decision.

840
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,680
You don't make that decision about laptops.

841
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,880
You don't buy a laptop because you're going to get a vanilla experience.

842
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,280
You nuke it and put whatever you want on it.

843
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
Right.

844
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,280
And that's something we're not doing.

845
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,200
We're putting the same image on all of the devices.

846
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,520
So the original BQE 4.5, the very first phone that we had, gets the same software updates

847
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,280
as the M10 that comes out next month.

848
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,920
And that's the same updates that the Meizu Pro 5 that comes out next month gets and the

849
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,640
next device and the next device and the Sony device and the OnePlus device.

850
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,600
And if it's ported to the Nexus X, 5X, then yeah, that gets it as well.

851
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,520
So it's the same software stack that all of them get.

852
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,520
Yes, exactly.

853
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,880
I think that's wonderful.

854
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,160
And that's the long term hope.

855
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,920
But in the short term, I think my Linux laptop from a few years ago analogy holds up here

856
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,120
because a lot of times people needed to still run Windows.

857
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,120
Still do.

858
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
They needed to run Windows.

859
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,340
This is going to be true with Nexus users.

860
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:42,520
They're going to still need to be able to run Android probably at least for the next

861
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,520
couple of years.

862
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,720
And so that's why you want a well-supported Android device, but you also want something

863
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,640
that can run Ubuntu and you really want a sweet spot there.

864
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,120
And so that's why I was...

865
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,120
That's where the Nexus...

866
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,120
Getting me all excited here, Chris.

867
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
Right?

868
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,120
Doesn't that sound right?

869
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
Yeah, it really does.

870
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,120
Yeah.

871
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
Because I want to run Marshmallow.

872
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,000
I don't want to not be able to run Marshmallow, but I also want to run the latest Ubuntu Touch

873
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
or whatever it's supposed to be.

874
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,320
I'm one of the rare people who will never get a Nexus phone again.

875
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,360
Why is that?

876
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,920
Because the Nexus phone completely lost power and the power button was faulty and broken.

877
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Yeah, frustrating.

878
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,640
So the phone won't turn on at all.

879
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,200
It just does a boot loop forever.

880
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,880
I've had issues with every single phone eventually though.

881
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,880
But yeah, that is frustrating.

882
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,080
Yeah, but one of the things...

883
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,380
The reason I like it though is LG made that phone, but under the guise of what Google

884
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,480
told them to do.

885
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,040
If you look at LG's phones, those are awesome.

886
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,040
The ones that are just there.

887
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,040
Like the G4 and G5?

888
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,040
Yeah, the V10.

889
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Pick an LG phone.

890
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,040
It's pretty cool.

891
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:43,480
And even if the crappy lower level $80 Leons are really impressive for their price.

892
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,000
And the best part, there is no bloatware in LG.

893
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,400
They don't do that stupid crap.

894
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,400
That most reasons...

895
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Oh really?

896
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,020
That is nice.

897
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,800
You know, that's actually really cool to know.

898
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,440
Why don't I take a moment and mention Ting because they sell the LG Volt 2 for $66.

899
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,320
And LG has just announced they're going to ship Marshmallow for the Volt 2.

900
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,520
So go to linux.ting.com.

901
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,520
You'll get that for...

902
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,920
You'll get this device for $66.

903
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,120
It ships tomorrow.

904
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
No contract.

905
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,000
No early termination fee.

906
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,640
You only pay for what you use, flat $6 for the line.

907
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,480
That's Ting right there.

908
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,480
Linux.ting.com.

909
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,480
Go there to support this show.

910
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,840
They have a great selection of devices.

911
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,640
They have right now currently a post on the history of the Kodi project, which is awesome.

912
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,920
I love that they're getting into that.

913
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,040
It's super cool that my mobile carrier is writing a post about the history of Kodi.

914
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,800
I mean, I totally love that.

915
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,600
They get it.

916
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,680
They do.

917
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,880
And they also have the OnePlus 2.

918
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,800
They have the Nexus devices.

919
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,800
They also have the S7.

920
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,320
They just recently added the S7.

921
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,000
The OnePlus 2, $349.

922
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,960
You could load Cyanogen on that, no problem.

923
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,720
You could also load pretty much a lot of images.

924
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,680
I mean, it's the OnePlus.

925
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,920
$349.

926
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,920
You walk away.

927
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,920
You own it.

928
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,920
It's unlocked.

929
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,400
There's no contract.

930
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,400
Nice and clean.

931
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,960
You want to just go buy the Nexus 5X from the Google Play Store?

932
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:02,960
Do that.

933
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,160
And then just get the Ting SIM and just pop the SIM card in.

934
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,320
Easy peasy, my friends.

935
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,560
They have, from the SIM card, starting around $9, which you can get Prime on Amazon.

936
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,560
Woo!

937
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,560
I know.

938
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,560
But then you can't support the show.

939
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,560
Go to linux.ting.com at least.

940
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,560
Yeah, just go.

941
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,560
Go there.

942
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,280
All the way up to things like the Internet Phone 7.

943
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,840
Oh wait, they don't have that out yet.

944
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
The Internet Phone 6S.

945
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,180
Okay, they might have that.

946
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,480
The Samsung Galaxy S7.

947
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,480
All of that stuff.

948
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,040
They have a great lineup of phones.

949
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,440
They have great customer service.

950
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,520
They have an excellent control panel.

951
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,440
Find out why I've been using them for more than two years.

952
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,900
Linux.ting.com.

953
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,400
And that LG Volt 2, I mean, it's not like it's going to blow you away in specs.

954
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,400
But I mean, hell, a $66 smartphone with no contract, you pay what you use, and you get

955
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,400
freaking Marshmallow.

956
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,960
It's a great phone for people who haven't had a smartphone before, don't have a lot

957
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
of extra cash.

958
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,760
Or if you just need a budget Android device, but you want to have something that's secure.

959
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,320
I mean, that seems reasonable.

960
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,360
I don't know when LG is shipping it, but they announced shipping Marshmallow for the Volt

961
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,360
2, which is really cool.

962
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,360
That's awesome.

963
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,360
Yeah, linux.ting.com.

964
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,360
Go there to support the show.

965
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
And a big thanks to Ting.

966
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:09,160
I'm going to keep trying to get myself that Ubuntu tablet, too, because I really do want

967
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,160
to...

968
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,160
What?

969
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,160
Yeah, you got it.

970
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,520
I mean, I want to play with it when you get it.

971
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,520
I know.

972
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,520
Because if I get it, you get to play with it.

973
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,520
Exactly.

974
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,520
That's very true.

975
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,520
Okay.

976
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,400
So, have you guys heard of Stali?

977
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,400
Anybody in the mobile room heard of Stali Linux?

978
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,880
I think I'm saying that right?

979
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,880
Yeah.

980
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,880
Who said yes?

981
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
Rotten.

982
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,880
Oh, of course, Rotten.

983
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
Okay, Rotten.

984
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
How did you hear of this distro?

985
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
Seriously.

986
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
How did you hear of Stali?

987
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,880
I thought I'd have one on you.

988
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,880
ZDNet.

989
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,880
Isn't it?

990
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:37,880
Okay.

991
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,400
Well, this one is from Infoworld.

992
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,400
But yeah, okay.

993
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Kind of same thing.

994
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,600
Stali promises to smash assumptions about Linux like a fricking wrecking ball.

995
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,600
And so they've put a wrecking ball picture in the post.

996
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,720
It's a distribution built with all statically linked binaries.

997
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,000
They say for speed and compactness.

998
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,200
Stali stands for static Linux, with static referring to how all binaries in the distribution

999
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,600
are statically linked against their libraries.

1000
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:11,840
Stali's project head says – and by the way, he also currently works at BMW and is the

1001
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,800
developer of DWM, window manager, believes that static linking works out better for most

1002
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,000
common use cases.

1003
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,400
The most obvious benefit in static binaries, have a smaller memory footprint and on disk

1004
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,400
footprint.

1005
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,120
I don't see how that's possible at all.

1006
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,760
Static binaries also claim to be faster, although there's no real benchmarks yet.

1007
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,720
And here's another doozy for you.

1008
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,140
Here's another one.

1009
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,840
Another way they're challenging the quote, unquote, directly from the article, traditional

1010
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,400
Linux distribution, no package manager.

1011
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:47,880
No repo, no package manager, instead all updates are pulled from upstream by way of Git.

1012
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,880
Also no system D, no system D at all.

1013
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,760
Stali has its own S-init utility, which is also statically linked –

1014
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,760
Jason Kuznicki Synit.

1015
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,760
Jason Kuznicki Synit.

1016
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,760
Yeah.

1017
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,760
Synit, which is also statically linked.

1018
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:07,840
And also, by the way, kernel modules not supported because you would need to link them.

1019
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:14,760
So this is Stali, the distribution that smashes assumptions like a wrecking ball about Linux

1020
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,760
according to Infoworld.

1021
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,280
But I mean, the ISO they provide now, it's like 34 megs, so that's easy.

1022
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,880
Is that a full desktop environment too?

1023
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,880
Well, no.

1024
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,880
That's here.

1025
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,880
Oh, just the command line?

1026
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,880
So you have it installed right here?

1027
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,880
Yeah.

1028
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,880
And this is all you get?

1029
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,880
Yep.

1030
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,880
This is it?

1031
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,880
Yep.

1032
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,760
This is how many programs are in slash bin.

1033
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,760
Take a look there.

1034
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,760
Is there the LS still on the screen?

1035
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,800
You'll see that the file system they use is a little different.

1036
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,920
That's one of their talking points, they don't use the file system standard.

1037
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,920
Right.

1038
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,920
Yeah.

1039
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:42,920
They really don't.

1040
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,920
Yeah.

1041
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:44,920
Sys and share on the root, log on the root.

1042
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,920
That's interesting.

1043
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,920
Dev on the root.

1044
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,160
Half the things are just symlinks to root.

1045
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,160
Yes.

1046
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,920
Var, user, and root, actually, the slash root directory.

1047
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,920
Yeah, that was confusing at first.

1048
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,920
Yeah.

1049
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,320
Is all our symlinks to the root?

1050
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,320
Yep.

1051
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,320
What?

1052
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,080
That is really weird.

1053
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,760
It is really interesting kind of as a study of like a minimal Linux.

1054
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,080
I wonder if I could show this on camera.

1055
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,840
I don't know if this will show up.

1056
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,680
Here, you guys, if you're watching the video, pause it and look at this crazy directory

1057
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,680
structure.

1058
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,680
I can't hold it for too long.

1059
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,040
But it's just, it's really, you want to grab it?

1060
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,920
That's really like something I've never seen before.

1061
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,920
That is special and unique.

1062
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,920
Wow.

1063
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,520
So the completely statically linked distribution.

1064
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,520
What are your thoughts having installed it and run it West?

1065
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,400
Does it perform well?

1066
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,920
It did boot very quickly.

1067
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,640
I mean, there's not much going on.

1068
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,640
I don't know.

1069
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,640
I mean, it'd be interesting.

1070
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:39,600
I could see it being useful for people who really need to, who want to build something

1071
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,280
very minimal or very customized and really have a very good conception of exactly what's

1072
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,280
running.

1073
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,040
You know, if you're trying to craft this into some sort of embedded or like appliance-like

1074
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,480
application, maybe this will, maybe this works well, especially if you already have like

1075
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:55,720
something that's installed as a, you know, like something like an app image or a snap

1076
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,120
package style system where it has all of it, it's statically linked or it has all of its

1077
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,960
dependencies within itself already, then that might be a great way to just use this and

1078
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,960
run it on that.

1079
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:09,720
Did you see that everything for like all the system services and everything, the way you

1080
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,820
start and stop everything is a single rc init file and there's an rc like shutdown file.

1081
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,160
It's all in one file.

1082
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,480
All of it.

1083
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,080
Everything for simplicity.

1084
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,760
That's the rc.exit power off.

1085
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,880
Okay, Rod, what were your first thoughts when you read the headline?

1086
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,880
I mean, can you see the argument for it?

1087
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,520
Could you make a case for it?

1088
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,520
Statically linked, yes.

1089
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,520
I mean, in certain cases that makes sense.

1090
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,880
The entire system, no.

1091
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:40,880
It looked ridiculous.

1092
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,120
But I laughed when I saw the bashing system thing and they're like making it called Senate.

1093
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,120
That was just funny.

1094
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,120
Yeah.

1095
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,120
Yeah.

1096
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,120
That is good, right?

1097
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
Yeah.

1098
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,120
That was a good one.

1099
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:58,640
When I heard about it's only 34 ISOs, I was like, yeah, so tiny core is about the same.

1100
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,840
And nano Linux is only 14.

1101
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,840
Okay.

1102
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,840
All right.

1103
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,840
Derek Delvin, you've got a good point to make.

1104
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
Go ahead.

1105
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:12,240
So I'm going to defend them in the sense that statically linking has become more and more

1106
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,160
common because hard drive space is not an issue anymore for shared libraries.

1107
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,160
And bandwidth.

1108
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,000
It fixes the problem of bandwidth and the problem of deployment is gone because suddenly

1109
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,560
you just deploy this binary and it will execute.

1110
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,840
So yeah, you don't need a package manager if you just executed.

1111
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,860
And honestly, when you're going to look like Google, for example, Go programming language

1112
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,800
doesn't even allow you to have shared libraries.

1113
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,520
So is that that odd?

1114
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,520
Probably not.

1115
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:44,000
About the system, the part, well, if you are statically linking everything, then the other

1116
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,280
components don't need to be initialized the same way because there's no dependencies to

1117
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,880
initialize before.

1118
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,280
So of course they're going to make something that, you know, that it's just different because

1119
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,520
they don't need it even.

1120
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:01,400
Moving on to the next point, you know, it's not much different than having, you know,

1121
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:08,040
when you're an Android busy box, having your RC, having all the programs inside just with

1122
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,980
the command line options that then inside the program splits them out.

1123
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,040
So that's not that big of a deal and not that different anyway.

1124
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,880
So honestly, it's a lovable goal.

1125
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,920
Now on the file system directory splitting, I mean, in the end, all of the separation

1126
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:29,720
was because you have to separate parts of the software like images here, resources there,

1127
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,800
shared libraries there.

1128
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:33,520
You don't have those things to care about anymore.

1129
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,480
The assets can be embedded into the binary.

1130
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,120
Then definitely yes.

1131
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:44,760
And as a last point, compilers optimize better when they have accessible all of the source

1132
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,760
code.

1133
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,640
So technically, yes, it can be faster.

1134
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,960
Yeah, it does seem to boot super fast and run super fast, right?

1135
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,960
I mean, yeah.

1136
00:51:51,960 --> 00:52:00,200
So okay, so now continuing on this narrative, I've noticed the media, the print media, is

1137
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,680
it has like a theme they're running with a lot recently.

1138
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,040
And that is, this could teach Linux a lesson or Linux has something to learn from this.

1139
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,540
Could this finally replace Linux?

1140
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:15,680
And so to amp it up a little bit, here we go, you ready, ready, let's

1141
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:22,600
Oh, rust, Redox OS could show Linux a new few tricks.

1142
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,080
See what I'm saying?

1143
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,080
You see how intense that is?

1144
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,080
Yeah.

1145
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,080
I'm scared for Linux.

1146
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,080
Yeah.

1147
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,560
Over the last several months, a team of developers has been busy doing exactly that using rust

1148
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,720
to create Redox, Redox, Redox, Redox, that's what I think too, a full blown Unix like operating

1149
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:43,640
system designed as a radical rethinking of the Linux approach.

1150
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,120
Redox uses rust for its kernel level code to provide more memory safety considerations

1151
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,840
and CLLs by default.

1152
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:55,360
Redox uses a minimal set of syscalls and a deliberately smaller subset than Linux, gotta

1153
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:03,360
get that in there, which avoids legacy bloat, gotta get that in there, gotta love that.

1154
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:09,600
The OS also uses a microkernel by design to stay slender in contrast to Linux monolithic

1155
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,480
kernel, and many of the OS's internal behaviors have also been rethought.

1156
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:20,600
While Linux and Unix both use the notion of every item as a file, Redox goes a step further

1157
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:26,320
and treats everything like a URL, so it's simple to register handlers for events and

1158
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:31,360
provides a consistent manner to perform other kinds of abstractions.

1159
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,520
Another radical break from Linux is that the software isn't licensed under the GPL, but

1160
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,440
the entire project is MIT.

1161
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,280
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

1162
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:47,440
I feel like we've been seeing a lot of MIT projects lately.

1163
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,280
I feel like we've been seeing a lot of going to teach Linux a lesson recently too.

1164
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:56,160
And I wonder, Daredevil, you say you've looked into it, and you have some thoughts?

1165
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,120
Because I know Rust is massively popular in the Mozilla crowd, it was recently voted one

1166
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,920
of the most loved languages on Stack Exchange.

1167
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,180
So tell me a little bit about what you've been following.

1168
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:13,200
So Rust does provide some safeties that might help mitigating some issues on kernel development,

1169
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,440
so I'll give them that.

1170
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,400
But it still implies that they're good developers in the first place.

1171
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,120
I don't know if they are or not, so I'm not making any statement, I'm just saying it implies

1172
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,160
that they're good developers.

1173
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,800
Then you're going to have to go to the next level.

1174
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,300
Actually, Linux kernel is a hybrid kernel because of the way it loads modules, and especially

1175
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:35,600
when you're considering KDBus that it's being implemented, so there's that part too as well.

1176
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:41,220
Moving on to the argument that Linux is complicated, they're saying that Unix philosophy is right,

1177
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,960
the implementation are the things that are not working, they're claiming their website

1178
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,080
anyways.

1179
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:50,360
Which means that they're going to implement most of the things in a familiar Unix way,

1180
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:56,700
they're just going to change some of the little details that are in Linux because legacy.

1181
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,200
So with that perspective in mind, I think there's people that are actually right now

1182
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:07,440
doing a bolder move when it comes to kernel development, they're actually saying, let's

1183
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,360
get away with all of these separation and multiple users, I think they're crazy, but

1184
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,680
there's talks about this and people actually working on projects, which actually go to

1185
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,940
differentiate themselves.

1186
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:24,000
And on MIT, that's all to say that the GPL is the whole reason Linux succeeds, because

1187
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,920
all of these companies fund Linux.

1188
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,520
Look, who's funding them?

1189
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,520
No one.

1190
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,320
I'm going to answer just who.

1191
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,920
So Alex Voda, he's saying, oh man, this is crap reporting.

1192
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,920
I hope he doesn't mean mine, because I agree.

1193
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,160
What I'm poking fun at is the narrative of the media that they are taking projects like

1194
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:48,880
this and they're using it to say, this is what's going to teach Linux a lesson to generate

1195
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,360
clicks.

1196
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:53,040
And I think that's a really interesting trick they're trying to play there.

1197
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,440
Wes, you've actually downloaded and installed it just there, or running a live image?

1198
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,280
Yes, I'm running it in VirtualBox right here.

1199
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,280
And yep, nope.

1200
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,240
So they have a 28 meg installer, right?

1201
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,680
You just like it finds your devices.

1202
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:10,640
It looked like it was using the same terminology as dev, SDA, hit yes, installed, I rebooted.

1203
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,360
It started up booting into a, you know, kind of familiar kernel looking startup, identifying

1204
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,800
all the devices, AHCI, that kind of stuff.

1205
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,800
Started the graphical environment.

1206
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,800
I've got it running here.

1207
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,080
Wait, there's a, you're telling me, you're telling me in a 28 meg?

1208
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,080
Well, it did.

1209
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,080
Yeah, I guess it must all be contained.

1210
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,640
A 28 megabyte download, it has a GUI environment too?

1211
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,160
But the mouse doesn't work.

1212
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,440
Oh, it looks nice though.

1213
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:31,440
I know.

1214
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,400
It's got a, it's got a file manager down there.

1215
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,120
It's got a calculator, a terminal, a sound controller.

1216
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,080
And it started up, you know, I just logged in and it had to, had a terminal anyway.

1217
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,960
It's another hold it up to the camera edition there.

1218
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,480
But you can see here, Wes, you want, you want to take it and yeah, as you can see there,

1219
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,480
there's the desktop environment with a sort of like your standard start bar down at the

1220
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,480
bottom.

1221
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,000
Boy, that is damn impressive.

1222
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,160
That is really, and that loaded pretty fast from VirtualBox too.

1223
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,160
Hmm.

1224
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,760
That was just in the time Daredevil was talking, I got it installed.

1225
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,760
Yeah.

1226
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,760
I get it.

1227
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,080
I have a, I have a sense about, about Rust.

1228
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,080
I really do.

1229
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,380
I don't want to, I don't want to talk out of my butt too much more about it.

1230
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:09,680
So I think I want to move on from the topic, but you know, I was looking through some of

1231
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,080
the upcoming talks, the sessions that are going to be at Linux Fest Northwest.

1232
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,080
Oh, exciting.

1233
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:18,520
Rust's Community Automation, and they talk about this, they say this talk will discuss

1234
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:25,440
the implementation details as well as the social motivation and effects of the customized

1235
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,760
infrastructure and workflow practices which allow a small core team to have such significant

1236
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,760
impact.

1237
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,040
They talk about Rust being a system programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents

1238
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,480
segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

1239
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,680
Behind the scenes, Rust is also a community that nurtures new contributors, consistently

1240
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:43,520
enforces its code of conduct, and maintains a high quality code base.

1241
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:51,240
This is a talk at Linux Fest coming up on the 24th in room CC236, and damn, that looks

1242
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,240
at 1230.

1243
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,320
Oh, I did just see something.

1244
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,640
They're working on ZFS support.

1245
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,640
No!

1246
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,640
Yup.

1247
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,640
Says work in progress, right?

1248
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,600
So like, probably doesn't work, but that would be kind of cool.

1249
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,360
Oh man, that's a mind bender.

1250
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,360
So I, you know, I know-

1251
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:04,360
Really giving it to Linux there.

1252
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,360
Boy, 1230.

1253
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,360
I don't know if I'd be able to attend that since I'm going to be on the air, but that

1254
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,360
seems like-

1255
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,360
Yeah, let Noah do it.

1256
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,360
Yeah.

1257
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,360
No, maybe.

1258
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,680
I would be really interested in going to that.

1259
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,640
That Rust community automation talk might be really interesting.

1260
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:22,800
Why don't we start talking a little bit about Linux Fest Northwest 2016 real quickly because

1261
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,360
that actually leads perfectly into my next couple of things that I want to update you

1262
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:27,360
guys on.

1263
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,800
First of all, you know what we've got to talk about though?

1264
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,800
Let's get real.

1265
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:30,800
Let's get serious.

1266
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,800
Let's talk about Linux Academy.

1267
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,440
When you're ready to get serious about extending your education, about learning a new platform,

1268

slash Unplugged, get our discount and go check out the Linux Academy platform.

1270
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,560
Seven plus distros you choose from.

1271
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,840
They automatically adjust the courseware and the distros they spin up when you need them

1272
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:52,100
on demand, including, by the way, when you're doing AWS courseware, they'll spin those instances

1273
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,100
up for you.

1274
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,100
What?

1275
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,100
I know, man.

1276
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,100
It's a really cool platform.

1277
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,600
Tons of cool features, tons of courseware focused on the different aspects built around

1278
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,880
Linux that run on top of Linux or Linux itself.

1279
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,260
They have systems and tools available if you don't have a lot of time, and if you want

1280
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:11,720
to go get some of the top high-grade courses and certifications, Linux Academy has the

1281
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,720
courseware on it.

1282
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,600
They just recently did another OpenStack certification courseware.

1283
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,280
They've got awesome courseware on the Red Hat certified stuff.

1284
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,680
If you need scenario-based labs so that way you know exactly what you're doing when you

1285
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,520
go do it in production, they've got courseware on that.

1286
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,200
If you want instructor mentoring, they've got a Help Instructors available if you want

1287
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,200
that.

1288
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,200
They've got live streams.

1289
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,600
They've got a community stack full of Jupyter broadcasting members.

1290
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:34,840
I love it, but more than all, more than all of it, I love that there was a company out

1291
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,000
there that said, Linux is an amazing platform, and none of the educational sites out there

1292
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
are doing it justice.

1293
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,380
They're all treating it as a stupid feature that they've got to check the box, and they

1294
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:50,920
ship some crappy courseware alongside their Adobe After Effects courseware and their motion

1295
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,920
…

1296
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,920
Yeah, exactly.

1297
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,920
It's just one more application to that.

1298
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,920
It's one more thing.

1299
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,920
I'm so sick and tired of that.

1300
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,960
So the folks at Linux Academy who are passionate about Linux and open source themselves, educators

1301
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,040
and developers, friends, they came together, they started the Linux Academy.

1302
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,280
Now it's grown into a business where they're growing like crazy with new staff members

1303
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:10,960
dedicated to all kinds of great things for your content, and they've built this platform

1304
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,700
to help promote Linux and give people a real place to learn Linux by people that know and

1305
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:18,680
love Linux themselves, linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

1306
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,240

1309
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,640
Thank you, Linux Academy.

1310
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:35,960
All right, so in 2018, when Jupyter Broadcasting is making Leo Laporte money, I mean, we're

1311
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,480
talking not right now, something down the road, but when we're making Leo Laporte money

1312
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,480
…

1313
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,480
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

1314
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,480
I'm going to fly everybody out in the mumbroom.

1315
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,480
You mean in the year of the Linux desktop.

1316
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,480
Right, yeah.

1317
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,880
Yeah, where we've released Jupyter Broadcasting OS based on Ubuntu Mate.

1318
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,080
That's where your wallpaper is the live stream all the time.

1319
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,080
Yeah, yeah.

1320
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,080
And every time you …

1321
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,240
You're at Wayland.

1322
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,560
I wish all of you guys, I wish you could all be at Linux Fest Northwest.

1323
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,520
Maybe we could like bring the mumble room in at some point on the live stream.

1324
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:07,520
That would be fun.

1325
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,320
That would be cool to actually be able to do that because I feel like it's one of

1326
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:16,280
the neater events, not just in Washington, but in the States and so I'd love it if

1327
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,280
you guys can make it.

1328
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,280
Maybe one day.

1329
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,280
Maybe one day.

1330
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,000
So I had a couple of things I wanted to cover real quickly.

1331
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,040
If you didn't see this week's Linux action show briefly, I'll just mention Noah and

1332
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,040
I have officially made a stash bet.

1333
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:37,000
The stash bet is briefly, if he loses to Emma, he has to grow a mustache for six months and

1334
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
he's not very good at it.

1335
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
So that'd be embarrassing.

1336
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,560
And he'll be visible every week.

1337
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:46,740
I want him to win, but if he wins, I will shave my mustache in order to motivate him

1338
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,000
to do it.

1339
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,120
That's how dedicated I am to winning.

1340
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,540
So that's the stash bet.

1341
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,040
Just the mustache, not the beard.

1342
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,840
Well, I don't know.

1343
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:59,000
I doubt it because then I start getting carded and that is super annoying.

1344
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I hate getting carded.

1345
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
It's your handsome young face.

1346
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,880
Don't you look like an Amish person if you do that?

1347
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,120
Yes, that is the problem.

1348
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,800
I will very much look like an Amish person, a lot.

1349
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,920
But I also want Noah to win by a large margin.

1350
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,240
So I need a little help from you.

1351
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,200
I really want to see you look like an Amish person.

1352
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,720
I really want to see that.

1353
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,120
Well, then Noah's got to win.

1354
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,680
So here's what I figured out is we've got to change the game up a little bit.

1355
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:28,240
I don't want to talk bad about our boy Noah, but I'm looking at the playing field and I'm

1356
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,620
thinking Emma has got the cards stacked in her favor right now.

1357
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,620
So I want to change it up.

1358
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,680
And what I want to do is I want us to be able to go mobile.

1359
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,380
I want us to be able to go around and go to different locations.

1360
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,640
And so if people are listening to this and are going to make it to the Linux Fest and

1361
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,760
you perhaps want to volunteer either helping with bringing a light if you have like an

1362
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,600
LED light or if you want to hold a camera or if you have a microphone or something,

1363
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:50,600
I don't know.

1364
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,480
You can call me Chris at JupiterBroadcasting.com because what I want to do is I want to set

1365
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:00,240
up two crews, one to follow Noah and his switching adventures and one to follow Emma and her switching

1366
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,720
adventures as they go out into Bellingham and try to get as many people to switch to

1367
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,880
Linux as possible.

1368
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,440
And to give them the flexibility to do that, we're going to have to have people dedicated

1369
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,840
to audio, lights, and camera, like an actual production crew, but there's no way we could

1370
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,840
actually do that.

1371
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:17,080
So I'm hoping people that are going, Chris at JupiterBroadcasting.com if maybe you want

1372
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,700
to help out with that.

1373
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,580
And something we're doing kind of different than we've ever done before, which I'm really

1374
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:25,080
hoping will make a big difference in how much content we're producing is, Ham are you still

1375
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,080
in there?

1376
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,080
Hey Ham!

1377
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,240
I think Ham left.

1378
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,040
Ham is going to be, we're going to go out and pick him up in the Lady Jupiter about

1379
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:38,960
a week before Linux Fest and he's going to be staying about four or five days, three

1380
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:46,400
days after Linux Fest here at JB1 to help Rekai and I go through all of the content,

1381
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,720
so all of the footage.

1382
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,280
So hopefully now we're going to have another dedicated editor on hand to go through all

1383
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,800
of the clips and stuff because we always have so much content more than we can ever process

1384
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,800
or go through.

1385
01:03:55,800 --> 01:04:00,960
So that's kind of a big expense for us, but it's also kind of exciting to have basically

1386
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,360
a game plan to what the hell we're going to actually do with all the footage we collect,

1387
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,000
which is something we've never really done before.

1388
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
That's awesome.

1389
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,360
Yeah, so I feel like we're going into this Fest and maybe this might be something that

1390
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:14,320
works in the future because a lot of times Linux Fest is where we just completely try

1391
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,080
something new or big because it's local and if we really screw the pooch, we could actually

1392
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,960
just drive to the studio, right?

1393
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,840
When you're in North Carolina or you're in Pasadena, you can't do that.

1394
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:28,160
So you get with Linux Fest, not only is it our largest, craziest, most expensive thing

1395
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:34,220
we do every year, but it's also where we do the biggest experiments and that's everything

1396
01:04:34,220 --> 01:04:39,320
from like road trips to hauling crew out to hiring extra people and new equipment and

1397
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,320
switching out stuff.

1398
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:42,120
So that'll be really cool.

1399
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,320
So we should have extra footage for that.

1400
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:47,120
So if you want to volunteer, be part of our crew and it might just be something like holding

1401
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:51,800
up a light and if you have stuff like that, like if you have really, really good high

1402
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:55,320
end portable production equipment, let me know.

1403
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:00,320
If you don't have high end stuff, don't let me know.

1404
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,320
Chris got standards.

1405
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,320
Yeah, I do.

1406
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,320
You know what I do.

1407
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:09,820
So one more thing, speaking of volunteers, if you're going to go to Linux Fest, I would

1408
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:11,600
love reporters that go to these talks.

1409
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,520
Like I was just talking about that Rust talk.

1410
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:14,520
Go there.

1411
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,520
Check it out.

1412
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,560
You know, I'm hosting the live stream.

1413
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,080
I'm interviewing people constantly at Linux Fest.

1414
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:24,040
I sometimes don't even get a chance to eat, let alone go to the bathroom or go to an extra

1415
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,040
session.

1416
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,040
It's here, Mike, Chris.

1417
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,040
I know.

1418
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,920
I start getting sick sometimes, it's bad.

1419
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:30,920
Yeah.

1420
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:34,040
Usually Hadia or Angela spots me starting to get a little sick, like, all right, he's

1421
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,040
got to take five.

1422
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,780
Hey, he needs five.

1423
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,280
And then somebody steps in.

1424
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:43,000
But if you're going to go to some of these talks, I would love for you to report back,

1425
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,800
come to the booth at Linux Fest, sit down and talk to us about these.

1426
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:51,400
And maybe if you have a camera, you could get some video of it just to give us an idea.

1427
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,520
You don't have to record the whole thing.

1428
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,720
Just give me some B roll.

1429
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:00,820
If you've got a phone with a decent camera on it, record a couple of seconds of the session.

1430
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,520
And then maybe I could get a way to get it on the live stream.

1431
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,520
Capture the experience.

1432
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,520
Yeah.

1433
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,800
So while you're talking about it, I could loop that a couple of times.

1434
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,040
I'm not asking you to record it.

1435
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,040
Come back and report.

1436
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,120
Like, like, you know, radio or newspaper reporter style, you come back, report, tell me about

1437
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,120
it.

1438
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,120
And we'll scream it.

1439
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,120
And we'll record those.

1440
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,320
And we could put those in the shows and stuff like that if they're cool, or at least the

1441
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,320
best one.

1442
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,360
So I'm asking for some volunteers to help us with the switch recording and production.

1443
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,640
And I'm asking for some volunteers to go to some of these sessions and then report back

1444
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,200
for the ones we can't go to.

1445
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:31,960
So I think that's going to be if I know that's asking a lot, but it's also gives you an opportunity

1446
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,220
to just be involved in the process.

1447
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,000
And if we get a couple people to help us, that's great.

1448
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah.

1449
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Chris can yell at you and tell you to do stuff.

1450
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
No.

1451
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
That's not true.

1452
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
In fact, you know what?

1453
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,240
Honestly, if you're super helpful, you usually end up getting invited to parties and barbecues

1454
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,240
and beer.

1455
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:49,680
I mean, really, there is there is so much upside because, like, we are super nice to

1456
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,760
the people that help us out.

1457
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:55,720
So there's a there's a there's a ton of upside, as you will discover, Wes, as it is your first

1458
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,720
Linux fest.

1459
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,920
You will see it's quite the party.

1460
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:06,020
Yeah, there's things that some people should go undercover and accept Noah's proposal to

1461
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,020
switch to Linux.

1462
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:08,020
Yes.

1463
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:09,020
Right.

1464
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,020
Or at least spread the word.

1465
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:14,000
If you know family or friends in the Pacific Northwest, have them come help us.

1466
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Have them help us.

1467
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Heaven's forbid.

1468
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,160
And you can also help us wherever you're at Teespring.com slash here's the thing.

1469
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,160
We've mentioned it.

1470
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,160
We announced it.

1471
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,560
I launched it on last week's show.

1472
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,600
I think we've sold around 60 out of 100 right now.

1473
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:34,040
100 would probably pay for maybe me to go pick up ham or hotels like it's like it's really

1474
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,040
expensive stuff.

1475
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,400
But these are awesome shirts.

1476
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,040
They got the last logo on the front, sort of classy style where a Star Trek communicator

1477
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,040
badge would be.

1478
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:43,040
You know what I'm talking about?

1479
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,040
You know, can you visualize that?

1480
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,040
Oh, yeah.

1481
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,040
Yeah, OK.

1482
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:47,040
So right where the communicator badge would be at.

1483
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,320
And then on the back, here's the thing.

1484
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,800
Do you have a minute to talk about Linux?

1485
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:50,800
And we got that.

1486
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,800
I love that Linux.

1487
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:52,800
It's just big.

1488
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:53,800
Right on that.

1489
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,800
You can't you can't miss it.

1490
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,260
Look how sharp that S is with with red.

1491
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,520
It looks like you're some sort of official or something like that.

1492
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,120
We also got the hoodie here.

1493
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,000
Just an insider tip.

1494
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,360
Gray is gorgeous.

1495
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,280
It is a it is a gorgeous kind of charcoal gray.

1496
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:08,840
Red is bold and gets attention.

1497
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,960
So if you don't have a red one, either way, people will be like just touching it.

1498
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:16,280
And the long sleeve shirts, if you have if I don't know what your build is, but if your

1499
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:21,960
build is similar to my build, the long sleeve shirts can be can be pretty can be pretty generous.

1500
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,960
This is one of them.

1501
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,120
This is one of the Jupiter broadcasting ones.

1502
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,440
We have different sizes and you can get different colors.

1503
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:30,280
I'm just saying, depending on your you if you're a medium, you are going to get lazy

1504
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,280
with these shirts.

1505
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:34,720
If it's an extra large, the way it's cut with the shoulders is still very generous and makes

1506
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,680
you look like you have nice shoulders and still a figure.

1507
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,220
And all people will see is the ladies love or the gentleman.

1508
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:45,880
And then when they go, oh, who's that handsome or gorgeous individual?

1509
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,300
And what is this Linux?

1510
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,300
And you start the conversation.

1511
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:53,440
So I'm just saying, here's the thing at Teespring dot com slash here's the thing.

1512
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:59,060
And you know, Wes, I know I mentioned this once before, too, but we are doing a.

1513
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,060
That's really what it looks like, folks.

1514
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:04,440
I mean, that's exactly what it looks like here in the studio with all of the mystique,

1515
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:05,440
the hat.

1516
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:06,440
You just want to open it.

1517
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,440
You can't.

1518
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,440
Yeah.

1519
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,320
No, I'm leaving it like that as a tease to myself and to the host.

1520
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:14,840
Yeah, it's just there sitting there in the living room of the studio.

1521
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,440
We're leaving it in the box until the crew gets here.

1522
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,080
We are doing a big Linux build.

1523
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,960
I talked about it last week.

1524
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,640
I would love to know a well built.

1525
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:30,640
I mean, I'm talking well built, economical case that I could buy two of that hold, you

1526
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:35,200
know, at least probably six drives because we're going to have or maybe four drives.

1527
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,200
That's all right.

1528
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,200
Yeah.

1529
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,400
We're going to have an SSD for the OS and then probably five drives and probably four

1530
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,400
storage drives.

1531
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,000
You don't want to read one of those SSDs.

1532
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Probably read zero.

1533
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Oh, yeah.

1534
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,280
It's more about the speed because we're writing it.

1535
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:50,280
All right.

1536
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,280
That makes sense.

1537
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:52,640
Yeah, we're writing uncompressed video.

1538
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,020
And we may maybe one day.

1539
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:57,000
So we're so if you I don't want to give away too much.

1540
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,560
So this is a secret build.

1541
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,680
But let's just say one day I would like this to be able to support 4K video bit rates and

1542
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,680
it's going to be running Linux.

1543
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,520
I'm just going to leave it at that.

1544
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,440
That's your hint for what these builds are.

1545
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:14,600
And we need a really nice presentable case that let's say we ended up building something

1546
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:18,480
that was so awesome it actually showcased the features of Linux and we could take it

1547
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,480
on the road and show it as an example of what Linux is capable of.

1548
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:27,080
I would like a case that is presentable to people because I want to be able to sit down

1549
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:30,000
the table and be like, yeah, this is the thing we use.

1550
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,120
And I'll tell you more about it later.

1551
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,700
But just a really nice presentable case that isn't too crazy expensive, that accommodates

1552
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:38,960
good cooling quietly with a lot of drives.

1553
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:39,960
That's my request.

1554
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,720
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com.

1555
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:45,240
Look for the feedback thread for 138.

1556
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,240
And let me know.

1557
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,240
Get to it, JB community.

1558
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,760
I hope there's one out there because I haven't bought them yet.

1559
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,760
And Chris has zero time.

1560
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:54,120
Bitcoin is like up at 420 bucks right now.

1561
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,120
So it's a good time to buy.

1562
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,120
I'm just saying.

1563
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,120
Yeah.

1564
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,120
Wimpy, you have a suggestion.

1565
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,120
Tell me about it.

1566
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,120
Where did he go?

1567
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,120
I don't hear you, Wimpy.

1568
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,120
His mic is muted.

1569
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,120
He linked to a Lincoln HP.

1570
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,120
Oops.

1571
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,120
There he's back.

1572
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,120
Go ahead.

1573
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,120
Go ahead, Wimpy.

1574
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:08,120
Yeah.

1575
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,120
They're end of life now.

1576
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:25,960
But I've got two of the HP ProLiant microserver G7 in 54Ls.

1577
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:33,320
And when I bought those, they were about 150 quid because you got a rebate on them.

1578
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:36,000
It was quite good value.

1579
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,440
And I've got five drives in there, one TFS and four in a RAID configuration.

1580
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:45,240
They've also got the SATA connection on the back.

1581
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:50,680
And I've had a four bay SATA drive hanging off the back of one of them in the past as

1582
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,680
well.

1583
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,680
Nice.

1584
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:57,560
So if you want something that's low cost, but they're a proper case, they're a proper

1585
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:03,400
pro grade case with proper fixtures and bolts and they look the business and they've got

1586
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,600
the blue HP light that comes on the front.

1587
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,600
I like them.

1588
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:16,600
So they're cheap, they're not super powerful, but I can get 100 megasecond write speed through

1589
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,440
my RAID array and that's spinning disks.

1590
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,440
You were sick last week.

1591
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:22,440
You had to jump out.

1592
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:23,440
I did.

1593
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:28,000
But I teased it a little bit.

1594
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,960
I'm financing personally the hardware, so I had to buy it from Newegg directly because

1595
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,600
I only really I don't have any money to my name except this is liquid in Bitcoin.

1596
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,600
Yeah.

1597
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:43,800
And so I got to spend Bitcoin to buy something and Newegg sells directly.

1598
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,200
And if you buy if you buy directly from Newegg, you can use Bitcoin.

1599
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,880
So what I did, Wimpy, just super recap, so people don't have to go back and listen either,

1600
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,480
is we have a big build project.

1601
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,340
We're going to switch some some internal functions over to Linux.

1602
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:59,720
And so we needed six core processors and like 32 gigs of RAM.

1603
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:05,440
And so all of that is we're going to assemble that, deploy Linux on it, and then put them

1604
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,960
in production and make some series of episodes out of it.

1605
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:12,320
Got the motherboards and the processors and stuff, you're looking for the cases.

1606
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,640
And I figured I would wait again until Bitcoin kind of creep back up.

1607
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,120
It's creeped back up to the 420 range.

1608
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,600
Get some good value there.

1609
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,600
Yeah.

1610
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:24,200
And so if there's a nice case that's not crazy expensive that's sold by Newegg directly.

1611
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:30,720
I just linked in the chat Fractal Design R5, the Define R5 is awesome and it's $90.

1612
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,080
Oh, I've looked at that before.

1613
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,560
The Fractal, huh?

1614
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,760
It's very understated.

1615
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,760
It doesn't.

1616
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,440
You can also get a window version too if you want.

1617
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,800
I don't really want a window.

1618
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:46,760
No, I just you know what I would really I really think I got the first link.

1619
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:50,880
It's got like a more marketing thing so you can see like all the ridiculous amount of

1620
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:56,240
bays it has and it's got support for like extended GPUs and stuff.

1621
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,400
Extended so I would really think that is three by five drives.

1622
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,400
That does look classy.

1623
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:05,040
I'll give it that classy is actually maybe actually the good way is maybe a good way

1624
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,040
to go.

1625
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,080
I actually have the R4 of this and it's awesome.

1626
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:11,080
Kind of want one now.

1627
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,780
I think what we're going to build is going to be something unique in media broadcasting

1628
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:18,720
and especially online media broadcasting.

1629
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:23,520
It'd be neat to turn this into like to do it this way and turn it kind of into a recipe.

1630
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:24,520
I think so too.

1631
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,520
Right?

1632
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:26,520
Like here, get this.

1633
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,520
Here's the software.

1634
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,680
Well, the reason this is awesome, you can remove the bays and put them in different

1635
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:30,680
configurations if you want to.

1636
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,680
I've seen that.

1637
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,680
Yeah.

1638
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,680
Okay.

1639
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:34,680
Yeah.

1640
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,680
That is really cool.

1641
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:36,680
Boy, that does look like a really nice case.

1642
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,680
And that's on Newegg?

1643
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,680
Yeah.

1644
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:39,680
All right.

1645
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:44,240
I will check that one out and I will put a link to that in the show notes if you guys

1646
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,880
want to check that one out too because that does look really cool.

1647
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,160
And there's also YouTube reviews coming in.

1648
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,160
Yeah.

1649
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:56,720
And so I would really love when we're done to have something that I don't know how we

1650
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:02,320
would publish it but basically it would be a recipe like you said or it's difficult Wes

1651
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,800
because it literally changes every three to six months.

1652
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,800
Well, of course.

1653
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,720
So I don't know exactly how to work it but almost something that you could reproduce

1654
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:14,680
yourself and then sit down and accomplish a lot of what we do using all open source

1655
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,680
tools.

1656
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,680
I don't know yet.

1657
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,680
We'll see.

1658
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,000
But anyways, and I might be jumping ahead too because one of the things is, one of the

1659
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,160
reasons why I'm being kind of secretive is we're going to build it and see how far we

1660
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,160
get.

1661
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,160
Right.

1662
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,160
See what we have to work with.

1663
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,160
Yeah.

1664
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,160
Yeah.

1665
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,160
Yeah.

1666
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,160
And we're going to try to push it as far as we can.

1667
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:30,160
And so I'm really excited about it.

1668
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,400
And that's why, you know, that's just like part of what we're doing.

1669
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:35,360
Like that's not even really Fest related but since everybody's out here we're going to

1670
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:41,680
take advantage of it during Linux Fest and get everything done at the same time.

1671
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,680
It's really cool.

1672
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,680
Oh, I'm excited.

1673
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,680
I am too.

1674
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,680
I am too.

1675
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,880
I mean, the design stuff looks pretty cool.

1676
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,360
I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

1677
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,360
And let me see.

1678
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,360
Where was that?

1679
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,360
Oh boy.

1680
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,360
We got YouTube videos too.

1681
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:59,120
I'll put a link to the YouTube review from hardware conducts, hardware conducts in the

1682
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,120
show notes as well.

1683
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,120
Okay.

1684
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,480
Any other closing thoughts from the moment before we wrap up guys?

1685
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:06,880
Oh, you hear that?

1686
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,120
Could you imagine?

1687
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:12,240
Could you imagine you're sitting like at your local library at a Linux meeting and you ask

1688
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,240
that question and nobody actually said anything?

1689
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:15,240
That never happens.

1690
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:18,440
There's always some guy who's got something to add.

1691
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:19,440
Well.

1692
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,440
Hello some guy.

1693
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:21,440
Actually.

1694
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,440
Are you guys serious?

1695
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:23,440
Are you serious?

1696
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,440
Are you just joshing with me?

1697
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:25,440
Because that's what actually.

1698
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,440
On the other hand.

1699
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,440
Oh no.

1700
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,440
Okay.

1701
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,440
All right.

1702
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,440
Okay.

1703
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:31,440
Very good.

1704
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,440
Very good.

1705
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,440
You got it.

1706
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,440
Yeah.

1707
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,440
Yeah.

1708
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,440
The thing is.

1709
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:37,440
So here's the thing.

1710
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:38,440
Oh no.

1711
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,440
Oh no.

1712
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:40,440
I almost forgot.

1713
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:41,440
No.

1714
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:42,440
Here's the other thing.

1715
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,440
No.

1716
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,440
I'm getting this out of here.

1717
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,440
I'm getting this out of here.

1718
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,440
I'm cutting you guys off.

1719
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,440
And I almost forgot.

1720
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,360
That brings us to the end of this week's episode of Linux Uploads.

1721
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,360
The show that never ends.

1722
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,360
We just got trolled there.

1723
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,360
We just got trolled.

1724
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,360
I know.

1725
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,360
By our own Mumble Room.

1726
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,360
We still got Poe Show coming up.

1727
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:57,360
We still got.

1728
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:58,360
It's a show that will end.

1729
01:16:58,360 --> 01:16:59,360
All right.

1730
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:00,360
Well thank you for joining us.

1731
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,360
Check the calendar.

1732
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:02,360
Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1733
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,360
Slash calendar.

1734
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,360
April is a crazy month.

1735
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:05,360
You never know if things change.

1736
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,360
I don't know.

1737
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,360
Hopefully not.

1738
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,360
Hopefully things just get even better.

1739
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,360
But check it out at Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar where we convert it to your

1740
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:14,920
own time zone because that crap seems to be hard for everybody to figure out.

1741
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:15,920
jblive.tv is where we do it live.

1742
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:16,920
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com is where you go to give us feedback.

1743
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,040
And you could also send me an email about any of the stuff I just talked about, Chris,

1744
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:23,440
at Jupiterbroadcasting.com or at Chris Elias on Twitter would be even better.

1745
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:47,120
See you next week.

1746
01:17:53,440 --> 01:18:10,200
I just want the new LTS with the new plasma desktop that actually I, there's no way I'm

1747
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,800
the only person that wants this, right?

1748
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:12,800
Sounds nice.

1749
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,760
It sounds like the new 16.4 LTS, which is damn near release.

1750
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,920
I know like a week or two after it's out, it's going to be available.

1751
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:19,920
I grok that.

1752
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,240
I want to try it now before release.

1753
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:26,360
I understand that if I wait two weeks, but here's the reason why is I'm setting up my

1754
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,840
machine now and I, if I like it, I don't want to reinstall.

1755
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:29,840
I don't want to worry about this.

1756
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,840
Yeah.

1757
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:31,840
You want to test things out, feel the water.

1758
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,520
If I, I'm going to do the review and if I like the desktop, that's going to become my

1759
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,440
new permanent setup.

1760
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:40,480
So I don't want to wait two weeks after the release because that doesn't really work for

1761
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,460
me for this particular use case.

1762
01:18:42,460 --> 01:18:47,840
And what bugs me about it is, again, I'm not trying to make this an Archibuntu thing, but

1763
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,560
on Arch, this problem is does literally does not exist.

1764
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:57,800
Uh, yesterday I had plasma five, five, today I have plasma five, six, nothing else has

1765
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:58,800
changed.

1766
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,800
Like it's not a big deal.

1767
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:06,040
I didn't have to change my release of arch and it's, it's so refreshing is it is so refreshing

1768
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:10,240
to know that I, it just, it just, when it's, when they have it in the stable repo, which

1769
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:17,760
was like a few, like a week afterwards, I got it.

1770
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:20,480
There's probably other distros that make it just as easy like that.

1771
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:27,320
Um, open suits is about to release their new builds probably like a couple of days or

1772
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,320
so.

1773
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,320
And then people who already have installed, we'll just update and get it.

1774
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,320
Right?

1775
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,320
Yeah.

1776
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,320
Yeah.

1777
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,320
That's beautiful.

1778
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:35,320
That's beautiful.

1779
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,320
That's all I'm asking for.

1780
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,320
They keep everything the same name.

1781
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,320
So it's like plasma five dash desktop.

1782
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:40,320
So regardless of what version it is, it gets updated.

1783
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,320
Yeah.

1784
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,320
Yeah.

1785
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:45,960
Five, six, one's already out on arch, which is, and so cause of what I'm, what I've done

1786
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:52,480
is I've re since someone, uh, when I, I have not reloaded the Apollo since I got the factory

1787
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:57,960
image, which came with 1510 and a couple of updates to support the track pad.

1788
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:02,400
And I just wanted to review the machine for a while as it comes from the factory.

1789
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:06,860
And now with 1604 getting here, uh, and plasma five, six and all this, I've decided to reload

1790
01:20:06,860 --> 01:20:10,000
the Apollo and try a few different things out.

1791
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:16,160
And uh, what I would like to do is land on a final installation for the Apollo that I

1792
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:19,960
just, I run for a while and I would like to try to run it for a couple of years.

1793
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:24,000
I'm trying to find an installation that will be a multi-year installation for me.

1794
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
That's quite the task.

1795
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Yeah, I know.

1796
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,800
So it's either gotta be, it's either gotta be 1604 with a snap packages and Docker containers.

1797
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,600
So you can run up-to-date things.

1798
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:33,600
Right.

1799
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,920
Or, uh, with, and I want, I want, and the other thing is I want the neon repos because

1800
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:41,280
I always want to continue to get an up-to-date plasma desktop, which is, this is lining up

1801
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,720
to be the perfect solution for me because the, all the pieces are beginning to be there.

1802
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:50,120
But the last thing that I need to be able to do is, uh, I need to be able to keep it

1803
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,980
updating constantly, keep it updating, always rolling, always going right.

1804
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:56,280
And just for the desktop, just for some of the core applications, I think 1604 can do

1805
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:57,280
that.

1806
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,280
I know I can do it in Arch and I know I can go for multi-year installations in Arch.

1807
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:05,440
This will be the first multi-year Ubuntu installation for me in a very, very, very long time.

1808
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:10,920
There was a period of time where I was like four, five, six upgrades deep in an installation.

1809
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:11,920
Wow.

1810
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,920
And, and, or it probably wasn't six, it was probably like four.

1811
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,160
Uh, it was a long time ago though.

1812
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:19,060
Uh, and I have not been, I have not stuck with an Ubuntu, with the exception of a server

1813
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:21,560
installation for a long time.

1814
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,200
So I really would like, I would really love to pull this off because I would, I would

1815
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:28,200
love to demo that installation during my review of 1604 in LAS.

1816
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:32,360
But to get there, I gotta be able to get five, six installed now.

1817
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,600
So my thought is maybe I will try installing Kabutu 15.10 instead, with the Plasma desktop,

1818
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,600
right?

1819
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,600
Get it just how you like.

1820
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:43,480
Upgrade to, uh, Neon and then upgrade from that to 1604.

1821
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,480
Interesting.

1822
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:49,120
I kind of like to watch that.

1823
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:54,240
I think it's, I think it would be the perfect blend because you still see, uh, you still

1824
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,320
see a lot of stuff released for Ubuntu.

1825
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,320
Yes.

1826
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,320
Quote unquote.

1827
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:00,520
Like anything you go download these days, anything that requires a download.

1828
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,520
Linux support, it's Ubuntu support.

1829
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:05,880
Yeah, it's pretty much, you're going to get an Ubuntu package.

1830
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:09,200
If you're lucky, you're going to get 32, 64 bit options, right?

1831
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,320
And they're devs.

1832
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,320
Maybe an RPM.

1833
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,320
Yeah.

1834
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,560
And then, and then, and then if there, if there's somebody who actually knows Linux

1835
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,120
users, there's also probably a Targesi.

1836
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,780
And then that's really something.

1837
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:23,280
And that Targesi will have both 32 and 64 builds in that thing, and it's a big download.

1838
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,920
So that's, that's the software distribution on Linux right now.

1839
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:31,680
And the, uh, the reality is, as somebody who is trying to understand things from an end

1840
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:35,560
user's perspective, and also as somebody who wants to sort of sometimes jump in on some

1841
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:40,080
of those commercially supported applications, there are advantages to having a machine running

1842
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,680
Ubuntu because that would be my machine.

1843
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:42,680
I try it on.

1844
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:43,680
Oh, okay.

1845
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,680
This is an Ubuntu thing.

1846
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:45,680
I'll go try it on the Apollo.

1847
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:46,680
And like, it makes a lot of sense.

1848
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,680
Plus, you know, for games or whatever, whatever.

1849
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,480
It makes sense to have an Ubuntu machine.

1850
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:55,180
And if snap packages can make it possible for me to get new apps on an older installation,

1851
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:58,520
this is really something I'm willing to give a shot because I think it'd be beneficial

1852
01:22:58,520 --> 01:22:59,920
for, boy, that's loud out there.

1853
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,240
I think it'd be beneficial for the shows.

1854
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:09,120
Did you ever look into doing the, uh, Tumbleweed option with KDE Krypton or Gnome Next as,

1855
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:14,440
uh, the, uh, the desktop and then using OpenBuild to get your apps?

1856
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:22,640
Yeah, you know, uh, I, the thing is, is for me, uh, I, uh, I don't particularly enjoy

1857
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:23,640
using SUSE.

1858
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:28,280
I think it's really a fantastically well-engineered distro with a lot of really good technology

1859
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,280
around it.

1860
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:38,440
Um, but I, you know, I had, uh, a dozen, maybe, maybe more, uh, SUSE Enterprise servers and

1861
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,760
SUSE Enterprise desktops that I've managed in the past and I used SUSE throughout when

1862
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:42,760
I did that.

1863
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:46,400
Uh, so I spent some time with it and a lot has changed.

1864
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:51,480
You know, uh, Zipper looks like a pretty competent tool, but I also find myself often getting

1865
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:56,000
a little overwhelmed working with it, uh, especially some of the tools and stuff.

1866
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:01,320
And so with my, with the way I look at, uh, SUSE, like any of the, uh, Tumbleweed or Leap

1867
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:05,240
or whatever is they seem to be on a pretty good track and they seem to be pretty sharp.

1868
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:09,920
So I bet, uh, sooner or later those things that I find rough will probably be smoothed

1869
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:10,920
over.

1870
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:11,920
So I just kind of keep an eye on it.

1871
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:17,120
But for me, it's not really what I, I'm either going to go with an Arch or a Fedora or, uh,

1872
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:22,000
an Ubuntu installation, not really likely to go with anything else.

1873
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:27,640
Maybe Debian rolling, maybe, but probably not.

1874
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:35,200
Well, I mean, I wouldn't go Debian rolling more than OpenSUSE because Debian rolling

1875
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,680
is more like, you know, untested stuff.

1876
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:42,680
Like they're, they're, they're tested, but yeah, it's probably something based off Debian

1877
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:43,680
too.

1878
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:44,680
I like Debian.

1879
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,680
That's why I say Debian.

1880
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,680
I really liked Debian.

1881
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:50,960
I was like, oh, that's why I like Ubuntu actually, because I like Debian and then Ubuntu got

1882
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:51,960
it better.

1883
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:52,960
So, hey-o.

1884
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:59,440
OpenSUSE's Leap is really interesting because, uh, they said there was going to be like not

1885
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,560
very many releases or whatever for the backend.

1886
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,880
They're going to do like, you know, once a year type thing and they can't, they've implied

1887
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:05,880
that in the beginning.

1888
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:11,980
Uh, they've already got, uh, updated to Plasma 5.5 for Leap and Plasma 5.6 is going to Tumbleweed

1889
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:13,720
pretty soon.

1890
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:19,000
What they mean is that the underlying structure, stuff like system D and the kernel are not

1891
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,640
going to be updated on a regular basis, like, you know, like a weekly or whatever.

1892
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:30,160
Um, but the desktops and the software that writes on top of that, uh, can be updated

1893
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:33,740
on a regular, uh, pretty fast basis.

1894
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:37,640
What I'm referring to is what they actually said of we don't have any plans, but we're

1895
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,600
looking at like a one year release cycle.

1896
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,720
I'm not talking about like what they could do or couldn't or like what they're doing

1897
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:46,720
now.

1898
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:50,000
I'm saying like what they said, they basically said we don't know exactly what we're doing,

1899
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,360
but now they've essentially changed to the point where they do know and what they're

1900
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,120
doing is awesome.

1901
01:25:56,120 --> 01:26:00,780
So it's basically just a, uh, base for the core system.

1902
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:03,920
It's like a slower version of Tumbleweed at this point.

1903
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:04,920
Right.

1904
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:10,280
Um, there is, I don't know if you guys know, if anybody knows which one I'm talking about,

1905
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:16,720
but there is, uh, there's a couple of, there's a thread on, on, on our Linux or somewhere

1906
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:21,480
where our Brown is answering a lot of people's common questions about OpenSUSE or confusions.

1907
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,480
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1908
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,220
Where he talks about like, yeah, software doing it.

1909
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:29,200
He's doing it in both the, our Linux and Linux, actually show separate.

1910
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,200
Yeah.

1911
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,320
But there's one like that's just like really recent in the last couple of days.

1912
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,320
Is that what you're talking about?

1913
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,320
Both of them.

1914
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,320
Yeah.

1915
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,320
He's doing on both.

1916
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,120
Uh, he made a, he made an article about the, what, what's, what, what's, uh, what's good

1917
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,600
about OpenSUSE and stuff like that.

1918
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:44,200
So, uh, it's kind of like those threads are devolving from that article.

1919
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:48,680
I think what I find fascinating about the threads is not any one particular specific

1920
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:55,980
confusion or a problem, but just how, how brilliantly they demonstrate how complicated

1921
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:58,920
some of the systems and tools are in, in the distro.

1922
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:03,640
Um, there's, there's so many things in there where, uh, his response is, well, that's not

1923
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,280
really the way we recommend people do it.

1924
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,000
Or we've never actually documented this to be the way you should do.

1925
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,480
We've never actually stated this or that's the way we used to do it.

1926
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:16,320
But now we, there's a lot of that, uh, there's just a lot of ways of doing a few different

1927
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:21,140
things in there that those threads, I think, I think our Brown maybe gets, uh, he gets,

1928
01:27:21,140 --> 01:27:25,000
they are so focused on the technology and the engineering, but they're not zooming out

1929
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,320
and actually listening to the meta thing that people are saying.

1930
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,600
The bigger thing that people are saying is that it's too complicated.

1931
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,640
It's too confusing.

1932
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:37,480
You guys are still, you guys are talking about tumbleweed and leap and I, and, and, and I'm,

1933
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,040
I'm still grasping to fully understand it.

1934
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:43,800
Uh, I mean, I do understand it, but I can quickly get them confused.

1935
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,880
I can quickly misunderstand like, uh, Wes right now, not to put you on the spot, but

1936
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:52,360
right now, if you wanted to get KDE 5.6, would you install tumbleweed or leap?

1937
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,360
Tumbleweed.

1938
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,360
Cause that's the rolling one?

1939
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:56,360
Yes.

1940
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:57,360
Okay.

1941
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:00,560
I think that's the one I would say too, but I could get it in leap too, right?

1942
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,560
Rotten?

1943
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:02,560
Not yet.

1944
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,560
No.

1945
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,560
Okay.

1946
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,560
You see, I don't follow.

1947
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,560
I don't know.

1948
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,200
And you know, I don't, I don't know.

1949
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:12,200
I mean, I know I started to complain about Ubuntu software management, but this is very

1950
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,440
confusing to me too.

1951
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:18,040
Uh, it's just, it's stable and tumbleweeds the rolling.

1952
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:19,040
Right.

1953
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,040
Right.

1954
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:24,360
I, I still though, I, I don't know, uh, quite to understand what to expect from which when

1955
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:27,500
it comes to like, well, if I want five, six today, I'm sure a few Google searches would

1956
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:28,500
resolve it for me.

1957
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:31,800
I'm not, I'm not saying it's an impossible question to answer.

1958
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:36,280
What I'm, what I'm implying is that it's still just a little confusing and people only

1959
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:39,240
care so much when what they already have works well for them.

1960
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:44,680
And so if it's too, if, if the on-ramp is, is too much of a climb, uh, I got other stuff

1961
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:45,680
to do.

1962
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,120
I think is what a lot of people feel and think.

1963
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:51,800
Well, if you wanted to get five, six right now in OpenSUSE, it's just install tumbleweed

1964
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,240
and activate Krypton, which is the like next version.

1965
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:58,880
So you get to use the beta stuff before it's officially released as builds.

1966
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:02,160
So it's, it's still not, it's not like it's like untested stuff, but it's kind of like

1967
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:06,080
Would that mean that I would then get like five, seven or like five, six, one before

1968
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:09,840
you get five, six, you get five, six, you get, you get the continuous branch of five,

1969
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:16,800
six until KDE releases their latest version, uh, or like the latest betas of the next build.

1970
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:22,360
So you'd get five, seven at some point with Krypton, but it wouldn't be like immediate.

1971
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:23,360
Okay.

1972
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:27,440
And heavens is also pointing out a blog post over at news.openSUSE.org that talks about

1973
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,040
the different choices for KDE.

1974
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:34,360
I mean, I understand, I do get it, uh, but at the same time, like it does take, it takes,

1975
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,960
I know this sounds really, this is the problem is I think they, they, they underestimate

1976
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:41,380
the cognitive load that just keeping track of what the hell they're doing takes.

1977
01:29:41,380 --> 01:29:43,160
And I know they're like, oh, that's, it's really simple.

1978
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:45,240
It's simple to them because you're the guys that dreamed it up.

1979
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:46,240
That's why it's simple to you.

1980
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,240
You use it every day.

1981
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:51,480
And if you look at the threads, uh, he's so good at actually specifically addressing the

1982
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:56,200
questions and saying how he should do it that he's, I don't know if he's grokking the overall

1983
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,200
issue there.

1984
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,920
My, that's just my impressions from afar.

1985
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:08,440
I'm going to kind of give them an excuse on, we are used to following how Ubuntu does it.

1986
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:13,640
And Ubuntu is somewhat similar to Debian and, um, other distros have picked up names that

1987
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:17,560
are already used in the cycles or the way other distros cycle.

1988
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:22,040
So we are used to seeing that cycle pattern and it's easier to recognize.

1989
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:26,920
So actually what they described in here is not that different is that the naming conventions

1990
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:29,000
are not, you know, easily to correlate.

1991
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,800
So you say, think tumbleweed and you use leap and then it's like you usually you are used

1992
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:40,800
to having, is this unstable or untested or experimental and you know, you did the notion

1993
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:47,700
of forward, you know, and unfortunately our brain in a way and added to that when they

1994
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:53,340
are coming up with the other distros, which are, you know, dinosaurs in the distros community,

1995
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:57,160
you're having the sensation that they have to show what they have different and they

1996
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:01,200
end up having to explain much more than the other distro.

1997
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:04,640
When you go and you pick up Debian, you say, I picked up Debian and you maybe mentioned

1998
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:08,760
one thing because everyone assumes all of the rest of the luggage that Debian already

1999
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,240
built over the years.

2000
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:13,920
When you say, I'm going to pick openSUSE that you kind of have to say, you know, because

2001
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,800
these, these and that and that, and suddenly you're explaining too many things and it seems

2002
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:23,480
confused, but it's just because of the time that they are arriving as a visible thing.

2003
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:27,120
That's when people, when you say I'm running Debian, they think you're running the oldest

2004
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,280
possible crap you could possibly do.

2005
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:32,480
So that's not even, that's not the issue of the naming thing.

2006
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,280
I think it's because they have terrible marketing.

2007
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:42,160
Like they, they have a lot of cool technology and just fundamentally the way that the software

2008
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:44,600
and tools that they have are amazing.

2009
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:50,260
They have, they have, the open QA system is amazing and if you just, if you, if you look

2010
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:56,520
at it and see how it works, it will blow you away, but it's really hard to figure out how

2011
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:01,580
it works because it's the most complicated website to go through you could imagine.

2012
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:04,720
Like it makes, it makes a folder structure like, you know, those, those websites where

2013
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:07,640
it's just like a directory of files.

2014
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:12,280
It makes that seem easier to navigate because there, you have to, you have to know that

2015
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:16,160
you had to click a particular link in this, like they have an order where you want to

2016
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,200
see a result for one of the tests.

2017
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:22,720
You click the name of the, the test, the date of the test, then you go into which package

2018
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:27,160
you want to see, which version of the test, then you have to click a link for let's say

2019
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:28,240
a Gnome test.

2020
01:32:28,240 --> 01:32:33,960
Then you have to click an icon to show a video of that test and the, it's just kind of hard

2021
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,920
to get to where you're going.

2022
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:41,480
But once you find it and you realize that this thing is doing an automatic test, showing

2023
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:47,160
a video, highlighting different elements of the test, like testing the deck, the desktop

2024
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:52,680
loading, running, opening applications, playing audio sounds, playing music, watching videos

2025
01:32:52,680 --> 01:32:55,680
and it's doing this automatically, that is amazing.

2026
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,640
So here's my, here's my, kind of my thoughts on this for, for SUSE as a desktop.

2027
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:02,040
Open SUSE Leap or Tumbleweed.

2028
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:08,520
I think the biggest, the biggest distro besides maybe Fedora that would benefit from XGG apps

2029
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:12,920
or universal app installers or however we're going to get there, it would be SUSE.

2030
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:17,680
Because at the end of the day, it comes down to, it's really got to be dead simple for

2031
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,240
people to get software installed to do work.

2032
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:24,040
If I want to convince people like Michael Dominic from Coderadio, he's doing a Linux

2033
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:25,040
testing experiment.

2034
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,920
Yeah, the last few, the last like three or four weeks of Coderadio, he's been reporting

2035
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:31,440
on his experiences of switching to Ubuntu.

2036
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:36,560
And he went to Ubuntu because he would, he wants to know, he just needs a path to know

2037
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:40,400
how to download and install software and it needs to work reliably because he's simply

2038
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,040
using this to code.

2039
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:46,300
He's writing Android apps right now and he just needs a workstation to develop on.

2040
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:49,280
And the timing is perfect because his Mac died and he needed to pick something himself

2041
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:52,320
on his own, install it and get rolling.

2042
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:58,280
And it's not that SUSE doesn't have the tools or the build service or the great software.

2043
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:04,720
The issue really comes down to the workflow that an average web dev might sit down, like

2044
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:09,000
we just looked at that Stack Overflow survey, a huge percentage of the developers are, consider

2045
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,280
themselves to be web devs.

2046
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:14,600
Okay, well if they're web devs, then they could web dev on Linux.

2047
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:17,040
They don't have to web dev on a Mac or Windows.

2048
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:22,640
So they, but they need a workflow that is reliable and reproducible for damn near every

2049
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:25,360
single application for Linux they download from the web.

2050
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:28,160
Ubuntu delivers that right now simply by market adoption.

2051
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:32,400
But if XDG apps came along and you could take that one download and you could run it on

2052
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:38,760
Fedora, Ubuntu or SUSE, then all of a sudden that barrier, that wall that's been around

2053
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:42,480
SUSE, the software availability of commercial applications, things like Sublime Text and

2054
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:47,960
Telegram and Herupad and some of the SIP clients that we have attempted to install, all of

2055
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:51,620
that stuff that has been traditionally so hard to get on SUSE, even though there's all

2056
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:56,120
these different methods to get software on there, that wall would fall because every

2057
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:59,440
application would be available for SUSE all of a sudden packaged that way.

2058
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:04,280
And then all of the technical merits of the distribution would be way more important,

2059
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:05,280
right?

2060
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:06,280
It becomes way more important.

2061
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:11,880
But right now, the fundamental box you've got to check is can I get my job done?

2062
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:15,220
And for some of us, that box is absolutely checked.

2063
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:20,880
But for a lot of noobs out there, because that workflow is not consistent, how you get

2064
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:25,160
that Sublime Text, how you get that Herupad or how you get that Telegram download or that

2065
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,900
Google Chrome link, because I'm a brand new user, right?

2066
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:31,440
When I go download Google Chrome, we watch Chase do this.

2067
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:35,520
He goes to the Google Chrome website and he looks for a download link.

2068
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:41,440
It never even crosses his mind to look in a repository or a software website, never

2069
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:45,240
crosses his mind, because he's literally been using Windows for 20 years, right?

2070
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:49,860
So he goes and downloads the deb file for Google Chrome and installs it on his desktop,

2071
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:53,440
just like Michael Dominic did that night when he had to reload his Dell machine in the middle

2072
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,320
of the night from a thumb drive and he didn't have anybody to call on.

2073
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:59,860
He knew that he needed to go get Google Chrome to do half his workload, so he went and downloaded

2074
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:04,040
that deb file from the website, and that's an expected workflow.

2075
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:08,120
And with these new universal applications, we could reproduce that same exact thing.

2076
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:09,120
It's not ideal.

2077
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:12,040
That's how I want to get my software, but that's how they want to get their software.

2078
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:15,320
And until that's going to be available, I don't see Sousa getting a ton of traction

2079
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:19,920
because there's too much of a barrier for that kind of thing, for Sousa right now.

2080
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:24,080
And there's lots of work around, and if you go post a question in Reddit, there's going

2081
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:27,560
to be somebody super smart that'll give you the exact command or maybe two commands to

2082
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:29,320
run on the command line to fix it.

2083
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:31,000
But that's not a way to solve the problem.

2084
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,720
That's not going to work at scale.

2085
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:36,320
Wes, there is a big old long thing, gosh, I wish I would have printed this out.

2086
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,760
I feel like I want to read this, but it's really long.

2087
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:48,480
It's from R Brown at OpenSousa, and he is writing here at the KDE mailing list.

2088
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,120
And I don't know if you guys have seen this.

2089
01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:55,360
It's how to handle KDE not respecting your distros requirements.

2090
01:36:55,360 --> 01:37:02,400
And it's in response to some packaging issues and about GNOME releases.

2091
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,680
And I think it's really interesting.

2092
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,520
We almost don't even know the rest of the discussion to read some of the interesting

2093
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,520
points that he makes here.

2094
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:11,800
He says, while I strongly agree with the sentiment that KDE should choose its own path, I think

2095
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:19,600
it's somewhat enlightening to consider that the competitive field KDE has to operate in.

2096
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:24,160
While in my last email I pointed out KDE is the default in only one out of the Distro

2097
01:37:24,160 --> 01:37:31,460
Watch top 10 and two out of the Distro Watch top 25, GNOME is the default in three out

2098
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:34,320
of the top 10 and seven out of the top 25.

2099
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:37,360
GNOME is the default option in all enterprise Linux distributions.

2100
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:43,240
GTK and other GNOME apps and technologies provide the foundation of the default choice

2101
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:46,560
of another four of the top 25 distributions.

2102
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:51,640
QT provides the foundation of only one of the other top 25 default desktops.

2103
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:57,600
The remaining 11 either do not have a default or opt for lightweight options like LXD or

2104
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,000
XFCE, et cetera.

2105
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,760
Or to put it another way, GNOME and its stack is at least three times more popular with

2106
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:07,800
distributions than KDE and its stack.

2107
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:12,840
We've seen this trend mirrored even within OpenSUSE.

2108
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:17,600
Even as KDE with the default option for our installer, over recent years we've transitioned

2109
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:22,960
from a strong majority KDE distribution to one where KDE is now used by less than 50%

2110
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:27,000
of our user base.

2111
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,720
Why all the doom and gloom?

2112
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:34,200
Because I think it's important we be realistic about where we are before we can improve things.

2113
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,440
Doing the same as the other guys is not a viable option when they have the dominant

2114
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,560
position.

2115
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:43,160
They already have all the buy-in from the wider ecosystem of distributions who put them

2116
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,760
first.

2117
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:48,600
They can afford to make questionable choices.

2118
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:52,000
It seems no matter how questionable their choices may have already been, it's not negatively

2119
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,320
impacting their adoption rates compared to KDE.

2120
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:57,720
KDE has to be better, smarter, leaner to compete.

2121
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:03,160
It needs to be easier for packages and packagers to work with than the alternatives, easier

2122
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:06,800
to put together, easier to maintain, and easier to track changes.

2123
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:10,760
I personally think the whole Plasma Application Frameworks Qt split has dramatically increased

2124
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:16,120
the workload of distribution packagers here for little to no benefit for users, although

2125
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:19,320
I do recognize it makes it easier to develop.

2126
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,320
Look at the applications.

2127
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,800
Are they all necessary?

2128
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:27,320
Does KDE need to offer an office suite when almost everyone really just uses LibreOffice

2129
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:28,600
these days?

2130
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:30,800
Is Scrooge a worthy competitor to GNU Cache?

2131
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,160
Does KDE really need two text editors?

2132
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:36,440
There's a duplication even among KDE's own web application offerings.

2133
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:39,840
Never mind when we put up against the backdrop of distributions are wanting to offer.

2134
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,780
I think there's room for streamlining there.

2135
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:47,560
And I know it's painful to suggest, but right now KDE is the biggest, heaviest desktop-oriented

2136
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:50,720
software stack for Linux distributions.

2137
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:55,800
All of the competition, even GNOME, is smaller, leaner, and therefore more readily integratable

2138
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,240
into distributions.

2139
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,720
But maybe going on a diet isn't an option.

2140
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:05,880
If KDE wants to remain technically large and continue to provide such a broad offering,

2141
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:09,040
then at least it has to do a better job of selling itself to distributions.

2142
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:13,400
In addition to the clear technical information regarding dependencies and such, distributions

2143
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:17,680
need clear information about why users should adopt KDE in order to parrot that to their

2144
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:19,680
users.

2145
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,200
What are KDE's selling points?

2146
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,880
What are the hooks which make KDE better than the rest?

2147
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:30,120
I fear KDE is currently making the same mistake I saw OpenSUSE make in the past by only trying

2148
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:35,440
to sell itself on technical merit and mostly letting software speak for itself.

2149
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:40,240
As I understand why, I've been saying for years that Qt is a superior platform for desktop

2150
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:44,640
and desktop application developments from GTK, but that being true hasn't changed how

2151
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:51,160
many distributions put their faith into which desktop stack first.

2152
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:54,920
Testing through software capability only speaks to a very narrow market, and problems with

2153
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:58,160
software quality erode that market dreadfully quickly.

2154
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:01,600
And I think it's safe to say that KDE has had some severe problems with software quality

2155
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,600
lately.

2156
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:07,220
And I do not think that putting all of the responsibility of testing onto a distribution

2157
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:10,960
is a sensible strategy to turn that around.

2158
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,880
Is there more KDE can do to make sure its offerings are well tested before distributions

2159
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,640
have to find a way to make all of the parts work together?

2160
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:22,720
KDE needs to make it very easy for distributions to sell the premise, the promise, and the

2161
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:25,760
benefits of using KDE to their users.

2162
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:29,720
Where possible, that should be more meaningful than just a bunch of screenshots and feature

2163
01:41:29,720 --> 01:41:30,800
descriptions.

2164
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,560
People should have an idea of what the KDE project is trying to achieve and therefore

2165
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:36,940
be able to buy into that concept by using your software.

2166
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:42,780
Right now, I don't see much information available to help weave such a story.

2167
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:44,280
That's my two cents anyway.

2168
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:46,560
Man, that's a great post.

2169
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:47,560
Wow.

2170
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:49,120
Yeah, it's really good.

2171
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:53,800
There's a few parts that I massively disagree of saying, and it's incredibly heavy.

2172
01:41:53,800 --> 01:42:02,120
But as far as the fact that GTK and Gnome have such a huge lead as far as users, that's

2173
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:03,120
totally true.

2174
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:20,200
Even when Gnome does incredibly stupid things, it doesn't seem to stop anything.
