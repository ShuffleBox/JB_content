1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,540
So don't tell Noah, but I'm kind of becoming more of a Kodi guy and less of a Plex guy

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,560
and less of an MB guy.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,360
I just have such a crappy internet connection at home that having local media is, not only

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,040
is it way faster to play and makes fast forward and rewind possible, but I can do full resolution

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,020
video like Blu-ray quality video and it plays.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,600
And Kodi is so great.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,600
Kodi's awesome.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,600
When you have multiple audio sources in a file or subtitles or anything and you just

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,520
want to quickly use the remote to turn it on or switch audio tracks, it's so good at

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,520
that.

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,320
And the playback is so flawless with Kodi.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
That's awesome.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,400
I just, I am such a huge fan of Kodi and I kind of had moved away for a while because

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,160
I was using Plex and having central storage, but that only works when you have a really

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,160
fast connection.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
Right.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
When you live in society.

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,160
Yeah, exactly.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,840
Wes, I just wanted to say thank you to Kodi and the Kodi folks.

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,120
I am really looking forward to Kodi 17 when it comes out.

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,120
Have you tried that MB plug-in?

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,440
Not that it might not work for you now.

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
No, you know I should have.

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Because I use that.

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
I still have it.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
I've had plenty of experience with it.

27
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
Now tell me about that.

28
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,320
Well, because it just makes Kodi's library basically transparent to the MB back in store.

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,120
What I haven't tried is using that and having your own local files.

30
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,520
That'd be interesting because then you could have your local stuff and if you got back

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,600
on the network you could have the full MB.

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,920
So I have that set up with some friends and they stream it over the network so then it

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,720
doesn't tax my MB server.

34
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,400
But Kodi plays it locally.

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,240
And you know what all those files are, Wes?

36
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,560
All those files are freaking DRM free.

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,280
That way we are celebrating International Day Against DRM, May 3rd, 2016.

38
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,480
Oh yeah, here comes the weaponized lawnmower.

39
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
It's coming again, Wes.

40
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Do you hear it?

41
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
I've closed the windows.

42
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
I've battened down the hatches.

43
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
I've battened down the hatches.

44
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
I took out the fan.

45
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
We still have a weaponized lawnmower out there.

46
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,640
So today is the 10th International Day Against DRM.

47
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,760
And you, Wes, need to take a few steps to take actions against DRM.

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Are you ready?

49
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Are you ready?

50
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Here we go.

51
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,120
Take a selfie.

52
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
My beautiful face.

53
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
Yeah, okay.

54
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
So we need to take a selfie.

55
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
Okay?

56
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
So are you taking a selfie, Wes?

57
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,840
So this is what it says, affectedbydesign.org.

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,480
Take a selfie and sign the petition.

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,880
Envision a future victory against DRM.

60
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,120
So this is something you could do.

61
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,840
So while you're taking a selfie, I want you to envision a future without DRM.

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
This is how you can help me.

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,640
You look really good there, Wes.

64
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,920
You can add your graphics to your social media profile or your blog.

65
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,340
You could submit a DRM horror story to the EFF.

66
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,680
You could make a blog post or video or a song.

67
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,400
Or you could share their DRM-free living guide with your friends.

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,200
Those are statements that you can take for actions against DRM.

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,640
Now, this is less stupid than telling everyone to go and DDoS the Apple store.

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
Okay, all right.

71
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Okay.

72
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
That was years past.

73
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
Yeah.

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,520
This is a positive campaign, raising awareness.

75
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,560
I could get behind this.

76
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,840
I'm not sure what my anti-DRM face is going to be that I'm going to pull when I do my

77
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,920
selfie, but I'll have a good go.

78
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
I have a recommendation.

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Shave your mustache.

80
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Definitely.

81
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
Yeah.

82
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,720
That's all you need.

83
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,920
Oh, it's a little breezy in here on the lip.

84
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,000
It's a little breezy.

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,220
I just don't know about this defective by design.

86
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,240
It just seems like it's been a bit of a snoozer from day one.

87
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,280
It's never for 10 years now.

88
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,000
It's failed to really get my interest.

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,960
I do support it in principle.

90
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
Yeah?

91
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,360
Maybe I will post something.

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
So hang on.

93
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Let me get this straight.

94
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm going to shave my mustache so that I look like an Amish person.

95
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Right.

96
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Is that what you want?

97
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Right.

98
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Yes.

99
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Yes.

100
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Yes.

101
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Ideally.

102
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
I'm watching.

103
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Okay.

104
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,960
That sounds like a great idea.

105
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
You're watching.

106
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Wimpy's watching the playback right now.

107
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
This is Linux Unplugged episode 143 for May 3rd, 2016.

108
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:14,480
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that already has your gift

109
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,400
picked out for Mother's Day.

110
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Yes, it's almost Mother's Day.

111
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,440
My name is Chris.

112
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
My name is Wes.

113
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,480
Here's your official reminder before the weekend, everybody.

114
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Hello, Wes.

115
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
Guess what?

116
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,160
We've secretly made a big show for 143 coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged

117
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
program.

118
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,480
We have some fascinating open source updates from funding to projects that are missing

119
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
deadlines and targets.

120
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Oh, I'm not saying anything.

121
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
Shh.

122
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,440
I'm not saying anything as well as some great updates.

123
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
Another look at VR under Linux.

124
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,080
We're going to discuss Subsonic going to closed source after years of open source.

125
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
What?

126
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
Yes, yes.

127
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,240
And then don't tune out.

128
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,760
We're actually not done talking about Ubuntu 16.04.

129
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
No way.

130
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
But don't worry.

131
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,600
We wouldn't be doing it for a third week in a row unless we actually thought there was

132
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,720
something genuinely worth your time to talk about.

133
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,760
So you'll just have to trust us coming up in a little bit.

134
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,600
Yes, and yes, it's true.

135
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,240
I am mustache free this week.

136
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
That's me brushing where the mustache once was.

137
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,040
If it wasn't, but he's still handsome.

138
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,240
We're going to power through it.

139
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:25,720
And to help us, Mr. West brought us some extremely unique and delicious beers from Diamond Knot

140
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,960
Brewery, a place special in my heart.

141
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
I did not know this.

142
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
No, you didn't.

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
No, you didn't.

144
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,160
I'm drinking the Binnacle Ale, the summer ale.

145
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
I think that's how you say it.

146
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
I believe so.

147
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,160
And you'll be drinking.

148
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
The brown ale.

149
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,120
The brown ale.

150
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,600
Now why is Diamond Knot near and dear to my heart?

151
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,480
Now we're going to get into all the Linux-y stuff first, but before we do that, I want

152
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,080
to go back in time, if we can, just really quickly.

153
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,600
A different time in Chris's life.

154
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,360
You know what's crazy about this?

155
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,840
It was May 7th that we released this.

156
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,840
It was probably about May 3rd in 2010 that I shot this video.

157
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,440
So think about this, Wes.

158
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,040
You brought me a beer almost like on the six year anniversary since I shot this video.

159
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,240
That is kind of remarkable.

160
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,560
Here we are at the Diamond Knot Brewery, the very place we are drinking these beers from.

161
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,160
For beers tasty, which you may recall from days past, which, hold on, sorry.

162
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Hold on.

163
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,920
So where we're at right now is the very highest point.

164
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,080
We can look down at all the people of what we're getting into today.

165
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
That's Wes.

166
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Yeah.

167
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:36,600
So there's a, if you're watching the video version, a little tour of their brewery, which

168
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
is nice.

169
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
One of their breweries.

170
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,360
We're going to go to their locations now.

171
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,840
And the beard on this guy we're about to talk to.

172
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Oh, what's that in your hand?

173
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,320
Oh, that is a delicious Bursky.

174
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,160
All right, so here we are.

175
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,240
We are still here at Diamond Knot and we've got Pat.

176
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,760
Now Pat's the guy you want to talk to at Diamond Knot Brewery because he knows all about the

177
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
different beers here.

178
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,560
He is, I kid you not, the brewmaster.

179
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
I want that title.

180
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,360
What does a brewmaster do at Diamond Knot?

181
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,960
Makes all bow to me.

182
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
That's pretty rad.

183
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,960
Nice, dude.

184
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
So tell us a little bit.

185
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,560
So we're in a, we're kind of in a, maybe for you, a kind of an older location, right?

186
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,320
These are still in production, but this.

187
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,560
I spent my first five years in this tiny space alone.

188
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
This was a fun episode.

189
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,860
So as brewmaster, I'm responsible basically for all beer operations here at Diamond Knot.

190
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,600
So we do a series of interviews with these guys, find out about the brews they make.

191
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,000
And if you guys are curious, I will put a link to this old shenanigans in the show notes.

192
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,120
It is actually pretty cool to go behind the scenes and see all the different stuff they

193
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
do.

194
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Yeah, it really is.

195
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,120
Old episode of Beer is Tasty and we do an interview with the brewmaster from the very

196
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,080
place that we're drinking beer from today.

197
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,360
So that's pretty cool there, Wes.

198
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
How neat is that?

199
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Thanks for bringing in the good old Diamond Knot Brewery.

200
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
That's a fun one.

201
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
All right.

202
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,160
So let's not go any further without bringing our virtual lug.

203
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,720
Time Appropriate Greetings, Mamba Room.

204
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Hello.

205
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Whiskey.

206
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Time Appropriate Greetings.

207
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
Hello.

208
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Time Appropriate Greetings.

209
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Hello.

210
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Hello.

211
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Hello.

212
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Yes.

213
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Good to talk to you.

214
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,680
But I wanted to, before we get into the super, super heavy stuff, I did want to maybe discuss

215
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,480
really quickly DuckDuckGo.

216
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,280
I'm personally a fan of DuckDuckGo.

217
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,320
I like kind of what they're about.

218
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,880
They've worked with JB in the past and so I wanted to just mention that they're still

219
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
out there.

220
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,880
They're still out there contributing to open source software and they've made some pretty

221
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,660
big contributions recently, including some serious cash to some of our favorite open

222
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,880
source projects and some important ones like SecureDrop.

223
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,160
My name is Gabriel Weinberg and I'm the founder of DuckDuckGo.

224
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,920
Six years ago, when DuckDuckGo was just me and the servers were still in my basement,

225
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,760
I started donating to free and open source projects that I depended on every day.

226
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,400
A lot of these projects were like DuckDuckGo in that they were labors of love by just a

227
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,120
few people working in their spare time.

228
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,520
I wanted them to know how important their projects were to me and to lend a little financial

229
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,240
support where I could.

230
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:06,600
So we've got $25,000 to the Freedom of Press Foundation for SecureDrop, which is a secure

231
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,280
way for people to communicate like leaks and stuff like that.

232
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:16,920
$25,000 to the FreeNet Project, $25,000 to the OpenBSD Foundation.

233
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,680
Crypt Tech Project is $25,000.

234
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,640
The Tor Project is $25,000.

235
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,180
Fight for the Future gets $25,000.

236
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,640
Open Source Technology Innovation Fund for FairCrypt gets $25,000.

237
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
That's interesting.

238
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Yeah, I thought so.

239
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,360
GPG Tools for GPG Mail, $25,000.

240
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Couple other ones in here.

241
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Pretty neat, Wes.

242
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
That's a lot of money.

243
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Good old DuckDuckGo.

244
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,960
Remember, just a reminder, if you haven't used them recently for your search.

245
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,280
Go send a few searches their way.

246
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,680
I imagine Popey's probably exhausted.

247
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,560
However, I don't see him in this screenshot here, so maybe not.

248
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,820
I imagine he was sitting in and watching both Baited Breath.

249
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:58,040
But Michael Alibril over at Ferronix is bringing us the latest from the Ubuntu Online Summit

250
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
for Ubuntu 16.10.

251
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
16.10, Wes.

252
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Oh, yeah.

253
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
The future.

254
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,040
Get off your 16.04 high horse.

255
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Fine.

256
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,880
Well, it's another setback for Unity 8 and Mirror, Michael writes.

257
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,660
It's been confirmed that the Unity 8 desktop and the Mirror display server will not be

258
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,800
the default for the desktop spin in Ubuntu 16.10.

259
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Yakety yak.

260
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
That's a fun name.

261
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,520
Unity 8 and Mirror will be available as opt-in features for users wanting to upgrade their

262
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,520
desktop.

263
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,760
But Unity 7 and Xorg will be the default for 16.10.

264
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,600
So disappointed, Wes?

265
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,440
I mean, I still want to try it.

266
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,600
I'm curious to see when it lands.

267
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,560
Maybe it makes sense to be in the next, you know, big update, but I'm not that surprised.

268
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,760
Popey, was it ever really planned that 16.10 would be where Mirror would land?

269
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,760
By default?

270
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Was that ever really a thing?

271
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
I don't think so.

272
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
It's a setback, Popey.

273
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
It's a setback.

274
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Is it?

275
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,080
Or is it just a really good idea to not dump stuff on people when it's not ready yet?

276
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Exactly.

277
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
Which we learn from, you know, past experience.

278
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,600
See also PulseAudio and Unity 7.

279
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Yeah.

280
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
We've learned this.

281
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,120
You know what would be a setback is it being a bomb and people hating it.

282
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
That'd be a bit of a setback.

283
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Yeah.

284
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,400
However, I do appreciate Larbal tuning in and following this stuff at the same time.

285
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,420
So I don't want to give him too much crap because I am actually glad he's reporting

286
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,560
on it.

287
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,800
There's not a lot of original reporting in the Linux community.

288
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,400
So it's actually nice to see some getting done.

289
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
I don't know.

290
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
A setback?

291
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,680
Well, you can read it both ways.

292
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,920
You know, either people want stuff to land like, come on, you need to have this stuff

293
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
ready.

294
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
I want to see it now.

295
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,240
And then when we land it like now, they're upset because it's crap or it's not finished

296
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,920
or there's something wrong with it.

297
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,920
And then it's like, OK, well, what we'll do is we'll wait until it's ready.

298
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,840
Oh, no, that's a setback.

299
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,240
You should have landed it now when I asked you to.

300
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,200
So move your entitlement and shove it somewhere else.

301
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,880
I think where I kind of connect with it is that, well, once we finally switch over to

302
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,440
X, that's going to be solved.

303
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,920
Once we finally get to Y, that won't be a problem anymore.

304
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:18,240
And where I felt like that came up a lot was Michael Dominic's recent tryout Linux series

305
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,960
that he's really done for the last five weeks of Coda Radio, where he was trying out, you

306
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,760
know, I'm going to create an app, I'm going to do this, I'm going to move over to Linux.

307
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
And there's a lot of questions.

308
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,440
It's like, yeah, yeah, I know that's a little weird right now.

309
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,520
But when Unity 8 ships and there's an officially blessed sort of UI look that things are supposed

310
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,280
to have and there's a clear path for distributing software and there's these snap packages to

311
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,180
make it easy for you to be in control of updates for your user base, you're going to love it.

312
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,740
And so there's all this pent-up anticipation for a payoff that we've all been waiting

313
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,360
for now since Mir was announced.

314
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,200
And so it's a setback in that, oh, we have to wait longer.

315
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
That's how it's a setback.

316
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
Yeah, you don't get your new toys right away.

317
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,400
They're going to be available for testing, but they won't be available for general availability.

318
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,280
And that's, if there's a setback, that's what it is, and I don't think it's a big deal.

319
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,440
There was also at the UDS, I don't know, I didn't actually get a chance to watch it before

320
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,520
the show, but Michael says that there was more talk about conversions apps, Ubuntu discourse

321
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,920
closing unless Microsoft steps in, and handling legacy apps with Mir and Snappy.

322
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,760
And in regards to Ubuntu Touch, it looks like there's consideration of skipping Cyanogen

323
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,040
Mod 5 and going right to Cyanogen Mod 7.

324
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,640
It's not necessarily there's anything in Android 6 everybody's excited about.

325
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,360
It's more that there's things in Kernel 4.4 that everyone's excited about.

326
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
Interesting.

327
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,800
And I don't know, Pobi, if you have any information on this, this is the thing I'm the most interested

328
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,360
in is I don't really understand the relationship between Canonical and UNAV, but it sounds

329
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,440
like UNAV is going to be the way you get navigation under Ubuntu Touch, and there's more discussions.

330
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
It already is.

331
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Right.

332
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
It already is a default app on the phone.

333
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,840
It's a community-maintained app, and we had a session where we discussed the future plans,

334
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,440
and Nick Lesh and Marcos showed off some of the stuff they've got in development for the

335
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
next release.

336
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Yeah, you sure did.

337
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
There's your mug right there when I go to the UNAV.

338
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Yeah, sorry about that.

339
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
Yeah, you look at that stash.

340
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,040
You've got way too much facial hair on your face then, let me tell you.

341
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,560
So anything of interest to know?

342
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,960
Is there new developments coming with UNAV, or just better integration, what?

343
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,240
I don't come here for my living shoes.

344
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,560
I come here for advice on my facial hair.

345
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
I know that.

346
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
I know that.

347
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,560
And your smell.

348
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
You're doing good on that front.

349
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,600
So what can you tell us about the UNAV stuff?

350
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,780
Because as somebody who seriously would be considering Ubuntu Touch, good navigation

351
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,520
is a pretty essential feature for me, especially somebody who likes to drive around.

352
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,320
The stuff we were talking about for the next release was more to do with making the app

353
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,160
work well on tablets and using the space well on a tablet, rather than just having one giant

354
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,440
map and then when you click on something it takes over the whole screen.

355
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,000
Having a split screen user interface where you have like a tab down the right hand side

356
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,400
with your list of restaurants and then marks plotted on the left hand side showing the

357
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
map.

358
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,000
Kind of split screen like you've seen on some of our other applications, that kind of thing.

359
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's early days.

360
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'd like to try that.

361
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,600
Yeah, I love doing nav on a tablet when I can.

362
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,360
It's so much nicer than on the phone.

363
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
All right.

364
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,680
Well, before we get totally off of Ubuntu Mobile Touch and before we get into Mr. Skooky

365
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,400
Sprite's HD Vive experience under Linux, something caught my attention.

366
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:24,020
I don't know what this all means, but the title is Plasma Mobile, a new base system.

367
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:29,520
At the last Academy, the Plasma team revealed their first prototype of a new Plasma Mobile.

368
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:37,440
Now I know what you've all been thinking, finally, another rebuilt mobile platform based

369
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,200
on Linux that nobody will use, finally.

370
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,520
Well, Plasma Mobile is designed to work with any existing operating stack, so they're hoping

371
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,140
since it works with any OS stack out there, you'll pick it up pretty quick.

372
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:55,060
And so far, they've based on reference images that were based on Ubuntu Touch using an Android

373
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,800
system inside an LXE container to make use of Android hardware abstraction layer.

374
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,860
Their initial touch base was Ubuntu 15.04.

375
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,440
Eventually their images started to diverge from Ubuntu Touch.

376
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,640
For example, they upgraded the libhybris to an upstream version because libhybris or whatever

377
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,800
it is, is too old for their context.

378
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,980
They also got to a newer QT version.

379
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:21,720
They upgraded Ubuntu 16.04 for the base, and they've integrated some neon packages.

380
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,080
To simplify things further, they wanted to experiment to see if they could get their

381
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,080
own operating system stack that can run on mobile devices.

382
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,880
After they looked at their requirements, they have a base system of Cyanogen with ASOP-based

383
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:39,100
Android or AOSP, and the Ubuntu neon system inside a Chirrut or container.

384
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:46,960
So this is the new Plasma Mobile stack based on top of the hard work of Ubuntu Touch.

385
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,940
Two things surprise me about this story.

386
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,600
Number one, that they're sort of starting over again with their Plasma Mobile base.

387
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:59,480
Number two is they're sort of unceremoniously using Ubuntu Touch, and I find that ironic

388
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:06,280
because I just remember some of the biggest pushback came from the Plasma group about

389
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:14,080
Canonical going off and doing their own thing, and here they are now using it as a base.

390
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,280
You see in the irony there, Wes?

391
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,040
I do see some irony there.

392
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,200
And they're like, but we've totally diverged.

393
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,200
We're no longer using Ubuntu base, well, except for 6.04 and neon packages.

394
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,120
But other than that, we're no longer using Ubuntu as a base.

395
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
I don't know.

396
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,280
Maybe I'm being too hard, but that was just sort of the waft I got off this.

397
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,700
Anybody in the Mumble Room have thoughts on this story?

398
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,840
Another mobile platform, guys.

399
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,560
Hey, I'd be curious to talk to someone who likes it, just tried it, but now it's new

400
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
again.

401
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Can you hear the plane crash?

402
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Yeah.

403
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,600
I just, I mean, I'm a fan of it.

404
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
I'm a fan of, you know, people creating things with their passion.

405
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,000
And it would be interesting if it was like, you know, on multiple types of devices and

406
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,200
you could just be like, hey, I got a new device and the KDE mobile stuff works, Plasma mobile

407
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
works great.

408
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,640
Well, device isn't limited to you because that's the problem I have with so many mobile

409
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
stuff coming up.

410
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,800
It doesn't support like a simple tablet that I have, so I can't try it.

411
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,720
Well, you know, being based on CyanogenLOD and AOSP.

412
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Hopefully that will help.

413
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Yeah.

414
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,040
They're using LXC for the, you know, for Android, this is, LXC is very interesting, funny that

415
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
we're going to be talking about that later today.

416
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Okay.

417
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,400
So apparently not a lot, not a lot of comments, but they have proof of concept working on

418
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
a Nexus device.

419
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,360
So if you are curious about it, they do have it up and running.

420
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,140
Using Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu TouchBase, and some of the Neon packages.

421
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,520
They talk about moving quick, right?

422
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,080
Talk about moving super quick.

423
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,720
So a couple of weeks ago, we had a chance to talk about the HTC Vive.

424
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,320
You know, that's the VR solution that has Valve's cooperation.

425
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,080
The creators of SteamOS, you may remember them.

426
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
Do you remember Valve?

427
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
Oh, yeah.

428
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,080
They make that Debian-based app.

429
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Yes, right.

430
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,300
And so we all thought that if they were going to release a VR solution, theirs would have

431
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,200
the best likelihood of supporting Linux.

432
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
I mean, it's from Valve.

433
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,760
Because you want to use it with your Steam machine.

434
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,200
Their very own platform is SteamOS.

435
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,560
So none of us were willing to put our money where our mouth was and actually try it.

436
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
We're cheapskates.

437
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
Yeah.

438
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
We're just not crazy enough.

439
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,800
But Mr. Skookiesprite did just that.

440
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:23,320
He went out there, put his money where his mouth was, and got himself an HTC Vive, set

441
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,600
it all up, connected it to his Linux box, and here's to report how it went.

442
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,520
But first, before we get off mobile, let's talk about Ting, sponsor of the Linux Unplugged

443
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
program.

444
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
Linux.ting.com.

445
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Go there right now, won't you?

446
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
Linux.ting.com.

447
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,160
I tell you what I did, and I think this might be a great way for you to go.

448
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,200
Get yourself a Nexus device from Google Play.

449
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Just do it.

450
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Don't play.

451
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Go get it from Play.

452
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
You know what I'm saying?

453
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Don't think about it.

454
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Just order it.

455
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Here's why.

456
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:56,880
If you're going to get yourself a mobile device, you know, I'm getting messages right now that

457
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
are pretty funny.

458
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,960
I love this Nexus 5 because I have been able to experiment with the heck out of this thing.

459
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,840
And Ting is just like, oh, you want a mobile service provider?

460
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Yeah.

461
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
It's smart in.

462
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
It's mobile on demand.

463
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
It's no contract.

464
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
No other termination fee.

465
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
You only pay for what you use.

466
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,400
So I'm sitting here on Wi-Fi right now.

467
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,120
I got Noah to set up a 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi network while he was here with his fancy Ubiquiti

468
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,600
routers that he likes so much.

469
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
I won't touch them.

470
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
They're freedom hating.

471
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
But he loves them.

472
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
So he set up a 5 gigahertz network.

473
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,520
I put the Nexus 5 on that, the 5X.

474
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,840
I rolled back to Android M. Ting was honey badger about the entire process.

475
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,400
They're totally cool.

476
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,480
They have such a great service.

477
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,640
And they have CDMA and GSM.

478
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,360
So if you have a device that does both, you can pick and choose.

479
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,360
If you have one that's compatible to the network, you can bring it over to Ting and get a $25

480
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
service credit.

481
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,600
I got three devices on my line.

482
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,800
I'm paying like this.

483
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,160
This is including Linux Fest, including the Linux Fest stuff, $40.

484
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
That is impressive.

485
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
Yeah.

486
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
It's really great.

487
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Super nice dashboard.

488
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,800
They have all kinds of devices from the Kyocera Dura, which starts at like $47.

489
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,160
How do you even say that again, Chris?

490
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
Kyocera Dura.

491
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,160
Kyocera Dura.

492
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
Yay.

493
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
XT.

494
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,440
Also, the LG 450 starts at $58.

495
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,680
These are just really nice feature phones that have like a battery that lasts a week.

496
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,320
You know, you just want a phone that lasts a week.

497
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,880
Then they've got things like the LG Volt 2, $66.

498
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Motorola E, $74.

499
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,800
Apple Internet Phone 4, $87.

500
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
No contract.

501
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,280
No early termination fee.

502
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,760
You only pay for what you use.

503
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,760
Unlocked.

504
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
You own these devices.

505
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,160
LG K7, just added to the Ting store, $143.

506
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,360
Antutel One Touch IDOL 3, $178.

507
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,440
Under $200 for a nice Android device.

508
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,800
They go all the way up to the Samsung latest, the Motorola X, the Moto X.

509
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
That's a nice phone.

510
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
That is a nice phone.

511
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,000
Internet Phone 5S, still a pretty good phone.

512
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,640
Samsung's, the latest Samsung.

513
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,200
Oh, what's that one right there?

514
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
That 6P.

515
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Ooh.

516
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Look at that 6P.

517
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Yeah, totally.

518
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
I know, right?

519
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,600
They also just added the Galaxy S7.

520
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,520
They've got all the great devices with no contract, no early termination fee, fanatically

521
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,120
good customer support, unlimited devices on one account, no mysterious line items, no

522
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,360
add-on charges, no contracts, no early termination fee.

523
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,000
You just pay for what you use.

524
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,400
You get started by going to linux.ting.com.

525
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Also check out their blog.

526
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,520
They always have great app pics and stuff, and they're doing a giveaway of the Galaxy

527
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
Note 5.

528
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Yeah.

529
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
Linux.ting.com.

530
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,640
Thank you, Ting, for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

531
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,420
All right, Mr. Sprite, Mr. Skookie, Mr. Writer.

532
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,360
Tell me about your experiences with HTC Vive.

533
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,120
Do you mind telling us how much you spent, just sort of starting from there?

534
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,120
How much you spent, how long the setup took, all of that?

535
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,320
You know, Chris, I'm not sure you can see the incandescent rage that is fueling me at

536
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,280
this moment, but those I've had interactions with in real life have been like, what's wrong

537
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
with you?

538
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
I'm like, it's the Vive!

539
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,600
Okay, yeah.

540
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,840
So my Vive arrived yesterday, took about two and a half hours to set up.

541
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
Now hold on there.

542
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,840
Hold on there.

543
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
Two and a half hours.

544
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
Wow.

545
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,280
And it's not like Skookie Sprite is some slouch here.

546
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,280
It's not like-

547
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
Right, no.

548
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,280
So what takes two and a half hours to set up about it?

549
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,240
Okay, well, one of the great strengths, I think, about the Vive as a device is that

550
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,160
it gives, quote unquote, full room virtual reality.

551
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,880
So that means that you have to set up two base stations that are ideally positioned

552
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:31,720
higher than you standing that have unimpeded line of sight between each other.

553
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,100
And that means like either you're drilling stuff into walls or you're jury rigging, as

554
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,680
I did, jury rigging a bunch of tripods and stuff.

555
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,920
Right, that's how I would think you'd have to do is put them up on a bunch of tripods.

556
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,480
Yeah, pretty much.

557
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,740
And so that is, the cool thing is those don't have to actually be wired to the computer,

558
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,760
but they do each have their own separate power adapters.

559
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,960
So it was a challenge.

560
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,320
And is this Windows only software to configure them?

561
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,760
Like where do you start running the limitations here?

562
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,480
Okay, so yesterday, I mean, I was so pumped, especially like, I was like, okay, this is

563
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
great.

564
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,760
Like I'll be able to have a whole week with this before I have to talk about it in the

565
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,360
podcast, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

566
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,000
And I cleared my entire afternoon, and so I started setting it up.

567
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And I'm just so pumped.

568
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,920
I'm like, finally, because I mean, I had an Oculus SDK too, but long before they dropped

569
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,120
support for it and blah, blah, blah.

570
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,240
So I was super, super pumped about this.

571
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,680
And I'm setting it up, and it's taking longer and longer.

572
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:42,240
And I get it all set up, and the cables are just enormous, and it's a big, big nightmare.

573
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,920
And that's when I realize, oh, wait, I haven't checked to see if this actually supports Linux

574
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,040
because I'm having some problems.

575
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,040
You know, getting the display to work correctly, and I'm like, oh, well, let's just go to the

576
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,520
support site.

577
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,080
And there's nothing for Linux.

578
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
So then I'm like, okay, fine.

579
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,800
I'll go to Steam VR, you know, because Steam VR, I mean, that's Valve, that's Steam.

580
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,800
That's Steam OS.

581
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
That's got to work.

582
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Linux.

583
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:15,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's Windows only too now.

584
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,840
So can you believe that?

585
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:24,920
So not only do you have to have at least a decent modern graphics, you have to have a

586
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,160
nice CPU.

587
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
So what?

588
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,640
I mean, realistically, you got to have a minimum $1,000 PC to run this thing, right?

589
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Well, yeah.

590
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Okay.

591
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,320
So my pre-order or whatever, which I placed in like the eighth of the month, like two

592
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
months ago.

593
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
Yeah.

594
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,200
So it took forever to get here.

595
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,640
I think it was like 950 bucks all total.

596
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
Not including the computer?

597
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
No, of course not.

598
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
Oh, right.

599
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Wow.

600
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
Dude, are you kidding?

601
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,640
I got like 28 terabytes in this here that I built.

602
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Yeah.

603
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,640
Yeah.

604
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
Yeah.

605
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
This is a winner.

606
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
This is a real winner.

607
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Well, no, here's the thing.

608
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,140
Okay, so the Oculus doesn't include any control surfaces.

609
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:15,240
This control, the Vive has these two really interesting, innovative little paddle sticks

610
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,560
that you hold and they're actually really cool.

611
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:23,640
It was very depressing when I had to pack it all up and file for a return yesterday

612
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,720
after just deploying it.

613
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,760
But Linux support, here's the bottom line.

614
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,840
They say that Linux support is coming now.

615
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Meanwhile, they had promised Linux support from day one and they were very open about

616
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,960
that in both their marketing and in their media campaign.

617
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,160
And then they just rolled back on it on evidently the 22nd of last month after they shipped

618
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,120
my unit.

619
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
And I was the last person to hear about it.

620
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,940
So that's a bummer.

621
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,560
And do you feel like, I mean, Linux setup, Linux support aside, a two hour setup with

622
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,080
this is an investment with these things you have to put up on tripods or mount to your

623
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,080
wall.

624
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,040
And this, are you kidding me?

625
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,560
You know as well as I do that virtual reality is absolutely unbelievable.

626
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,080
It's going to be the next transformative technology for the next three years.

627
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,760
It's going to be a multi-billion dollar marketplace, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

628
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
You're telling me.

629
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,760
I don't know.

630
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
I thought so.

631
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,840
But then Wimpy started to convince me that virtual reality is a hoax and that you give

632
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,440
me this story about a two hour setup.

633
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,920
They don't even support their own platform.

634
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
Forget the two hour setup.

635
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,920
That's the big thing.

636
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,760
Like the biggest thing that really depressed me about this and I, you know, because I had

637
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,680
to do, I need some official quotes from HTC and Valve and so I was, you know, calling

638
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,560
the PR people this morning.

639
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,920
The most depressing thing to me is that it shows, first of all, even for getting Linux,

640
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,840
it just shows like a total, I would not be confident in investing in this platform even

641
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,280
if I didn't run Linux now because like, oh, well, you can't even, like you said, develop

642
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,960
your own frigging platform, you know, wow, that's amazing.

643
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
Wimpy, you must be listening to this.

644
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,200
Do you hear this and think to yourself, this is exactly what you're saying.

645
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,760
This is never going to be a consumer platform.

646
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,840
Well, kind of.

647
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:14,080
I mean, it's very early days at the moment, but certainly the barrier to entry in terms

648
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,560
of the technology you need once you've got your bridle is expensive.

649
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,800
Your bridle.

650
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,480
Wimpy, have you ever actually sat down with any sort of virtual reality headset?

651
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
I have.

652
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Okay, cool.

653
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
So, all right, fine then.

654
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
That's all I need to know.

655
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,960
Then I will respectfully disagree with you.

656
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:43,160
I've used three different generations of virtual reality headsets and other equipment and the

657
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,960
graphics get better and nothing else about it is any more convincing or compelling than

658
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,400
the very first iterations I saw in the 80s.

659
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,440
You see, I totally disagree because I was there in the 90s and because I live in Vegas

660
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,200
and we had the best arcades back then and we had some pretty compelling virtual reality

661
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,600
stuff and so I wrote it all off until the Oculus Rift, which blew my mind.

662
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,440
Like, awe for the awesome was just incredible, I thought.

663
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,720
I think that eventually it will work for some games, but I think we're going to get a lot

664
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:27,160
of rubbish games with rubbish implementations of VR and I've used 3D TV as an example of

665
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,040
why VR isn't going to work and it's more to do with the fact that you have to have something

666
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,760
on your head and this is worse than 3D TV because you have to have something on your

667
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,680
head with a multitude of cables coming out of it.

668
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,240
Yeah, that is problematic.

669
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,680
Yeah, that's a big deal because it's not really virtual reality, you're just tethered to a

670
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,960
computer somewhere.

671
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
It's just ridiculous.

672
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,080
There's a lot of issues that people, general consumers, just won't get over.

673
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,080
They won't get over the cost, they won't get over the inconvenience and they won't get

674
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:04,560
over the average implementation of games and more importantly, I think that the games are

675
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:12,280
going to try and play to the VR capabilities in the same way you get 3D TVs for 3D.

676
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:19,240
Yeah, totally, but by the same token, every new medium, especially in terms of the history

677
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:25,840
of video games, has come with the same set of challenges and generally speaking, the

678
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,400
new and better looking and more immersive technology has always won out, at least over

679
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,400
the last 30 years in my opinion and I do agree, it's a big pain in the ass, but one of the

680
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,880
cool things about the Vive that I really liked and was really hopeful about is this full

681
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:47,080
scale, room scale virtual reality, like if you've seen the video of the chick using Google's

682
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:54,660
tilt brush to paint in 3D, when you actually end up using that application with the Vive,

683
00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:00,560
it's really impressive except for the fact that it was on Windows so I packed it up and

684
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,200
it's being returned.

685
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,560
The reason for that is we all know how long that to-do list is when Linux support is on

686
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
that to-do list.

687
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
That to-do list never gets done.

688
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,120
Those features never get implemented.

689
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:19,680
Five years later, if you're lucky, they'll add Linux support and I, for one, I was comfortable

690
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:25,240
paying my money, taking my chances with the Oculus SDK 2 because I wanted to develop for

691
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,440
it specifically and I was like, okay, fine, Linux support is body whatever and then eventually

692
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,160
six months later, they had the balls to come out and say, you know what, we're dropping

693
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,160
this.

694
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,480
We just want to do Windows stuff, which was okay.

695
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,480
I paid my money.

696
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:44,400
I totally, I totally bought, but these guys, these guys sold me this unit, not just like

697
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:51,720
is rumored marketing, but one of the key selling points was this is being developed in, not

698
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:59,860
just developed, but this is totally the partnership of Steam and Valve and HTC for Linux.

699
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,520
Day one, Linux support, they dropped that.

700
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
I mean, what?

701
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,120
I'm going to wait two weeks until I can't return it and then find out six months later

702
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,520
that they're not going to have Linux, you know, at all?

703
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,960
I mean, cause I don't have time to play anything on Windows.

704
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,920
I have to, I play 15 games a week for my podcast.

705
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,920
So it's like, wow, you know, like I have no time for anything other than games that weren't

706
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
on Linux.

707
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,320
And the other thing that's depressing about it though is that I think this was a big moment

708
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:34,120
for Linux from a hardware perspective to hit a general consumer market that actually has

709
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
money.

710
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Video games are money.

711
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,800
That's why Steam is such a big deal, you know, blah.

712
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:45,120
It leverages the market share, makes FOSS and supporting free and open source products

713
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,080
and hardware more important for, you know, graphics card manufacturers and stuff like

714
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
that.

715
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
And this is a big failure.

716
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,120
When I see this too, I see it as a sort of a huge disappointment, but one that I, here's,

717
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,840
here's where I'm going to get my temperature from, Skooky, and this is what I want to ask

718
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,360
you.

719
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:09,240
How much of the like configuring or aligning or calibrating or whatever you want to call

720
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,080
it, how much of the setup of the devices requires like a Windows application?

721
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,880
How much is...

722
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
Basically all of it.

723
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
You can't...

724
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,120
So they're going to have to recreate all of that.

725
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,720
They would theoretically have to redo all of that as Linux software to set this up.

726
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,880
Well, hang on a second.

727
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,760
The thing is, and they've been saying this for two years almost that they're, they were

728
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,640
going to hit the street.

729
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,120
It's not that they canceled Linux support.

730
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,640
It's just that now it's on the to do list and they decide to do that, you know, two

731
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,680
weeks ago, you know, after they've been shipping units to people.

732
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:47,840
So it's, it's theoretically, it's still coming, but no, and I've, it's, it's almost impossible

733
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,880
to, you need either HTC to, and I think it's legally complex for them.

734
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,400
I haven't gotten an official quote from them just yet, but I should at four o'clock this

735
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
afternoon.

736
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,240
Anyway, it's legally complicated for that, for them because of the, their partnership

737
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:08,840
with Steam and Valve, it's legally complicated for them to release their own Linux drivers

738
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,080
because they're like kind of tied at the hip is my understanding.

739
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
Makes me sad.

740
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:19,200
If Steam VR can't run Linux, then, you know, HTC Vive can't run Linux, which doesn't make

741
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,000
any sense to me because Steam VR is supposed to be built inside of Steam OS and that's

742
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
supposed to be.

743
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,720
I hate it when Wimpy's right, but right now Wimpy's right.

744
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
So yeah.

745
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
Okay.

746
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
All right.

747
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,320
So your closing thoughts, Mr. Wimpy.

748
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,840
I told you so.

749
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
Well said.

750
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,360
Oh, hold on guys.

751
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,320
The weaponized lawnmower is on its way back.

752
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,440
Well, Skookie, thank you for giving it a shot and letting us know how it went.

753
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,720
If people want to find your podcast where you talk about Linux gaming, where would they

754
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,240
find it?

755
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
Bestlinuxgames.com.

756
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
Hey-o!

757
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,000
And if you want to stick around towards the end, I wouldn't mind at the end of the show,

758
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,480
maybe we could talk a little Tomb Raider.

759
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Oh, cool.

760
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Oh, yes.

761
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
It's awesome.

762
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,680
New Tomb Raider came out for Linux and I want to give you my thoughts on it.

763
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:11,040
Before we jump into more stuff, I did want to mention briefly that OpenWRT got forked

764
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,040
by some of its own developers, which is always actually, I think, kind of a good thing in

765
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
a way.

766
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,360
It means drama, but it also means the people with the new project...

767
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
There's a passion there.

768
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Exactly.

769
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,400
And they're calling it LEDE.

770
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,240
It appears to be a move by new project leaders.

771
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,120
It's a group of OpenWRT developers announced LEDE.

772
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,640
Their fork of the project consists of a spin-off of OpenWRT with many of the same goals.

773
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,280
It's, by the way, LEDE, short for Linux Embedded Development Environment.

774
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
Brilliant, really.

775
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,840
It will continue to focus on being a great embedded Linux distribution with a predictable

776
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,800
release cycle and transparent decision-making.

777
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Hmm.

778
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,520
I think that could go a long way.

779
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,000
That's really one of the big limitations in that community right now, I think, is there's

780
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,960
a lot of... Especially on the DDWRT side, there's a lot of things that are up in the

781
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,200
air or a lot of you get your information from a forum post.

782
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,820
And they say, look, we just looked at doing this because the core developer count was

783
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,040
super low, unreliable infrastructure, and there was a lack of communication.

784
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
No hard feelings?

785
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,800
I mean, it sounds like maybe some, but I mean, it doesn't sound like it's a big dramatic

786
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
thing.

787
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
So LEDE, recently announced.

788
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,800
You can find out more.

789
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,520
We'll have a link in the show notes if you guys want to check that out.

790
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,640
Now, a question came in that struck me yesterday that I thought, well, let's just briefly touch

791
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,080
on it in the show.

792
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Yeah.

793
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,520
XMittal points out we have LEDE, LXDE, LXLE, and LXQT.

794
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,880
And don't forget, later today, we're going to talk about LXCE, or LXC, right, LXCE, and

795
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
LXD.

796
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,040
Uh-oh, weaponized lawnmower is back.

797
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
Do you hear it?

798
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Do you hear it?

799
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Weaponized lawnmower.

800
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:53,600
Okay, so Tetra wrote into the show and wanted to know about our power management solutions.

801
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:59,160
And the reason why this struck me, Wes, it struck me deep, the reason why it struck me

802
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,240
deep and hard was because it turned out to be the first bit of feedback I read right

803
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,320
after my battery died.

804
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,320
My battery died.

805
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
Oh, boy.

806
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,680
I couldn't work for like two hours.

807
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,680
I got plugged back in, and I go to read this, and that's the question is, what's your power

808
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,680
management strategy?

809
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,000
And I thought, well, how freaking... What is it?

810
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What is it called?

811
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Serendipitous?

812
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah, there you go.

813
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
What's it called?

814
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Serendipitous?

815
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Serendipitous.

816
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,080
The reason why I read this is that my battery dies, and I open up my laptop, I go to get

817
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
working again, and this is what I see.

818
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,080
Clearly, you need a better solution.

819
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
Yes, sir.

820
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
There you go.

821
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,080
Right there, Wes.

822
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,680
So we're going to talk about that here on the show in just a moment.

823
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,880
I want to find out what our virtual lug does, maybe what the chat room does.

824
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,600
But first, I'm going to tell you what I do, and that is DigitalOcean.

825
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,840
Head over to DigitalOcean.com and use our special promo code, DOUNPLUG.

826
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,040
I love that promo code.

827
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
All one word, Wes.

828
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,040
It's lowercase.

829
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Just put it together.

830
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
DOUNPLUG gives you a $10 credit.

831
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,840
Now, DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering you the most

832
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,600
intuitive way for you to get a super badass rig in the cloud in no time.

833
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,360
Less than 55 seconds, you'll have the machine spun up.

834
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,440
And if you only want to spend $5 a month, DigitalOcean's got you covered with 512 megabytes

835
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,120
of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

836
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:13,800
Now, we've been using DigitalOcean Droplets as our go-to Linux infrastructure on demand.

837
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
We need a system.

838
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
We just go to DigitalOcean now.

839
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Pin it up.

840
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,320
It took a long time to increase our infrastructure for Linux Fest Northwest to make it possible

841
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,320
to do what we needed to do.

842
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,720
DigitalOcean, it was a no-brainer.

843
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,240
And I'll be honest with you, one of the things I've done to make my management a little easier

844
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,200
is I've added Noah's SSH key to my DigitalOcean profile.

845
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,560
So now, when I want to collaborate on a Droplet with Noah, I can just add his key as a checkbox

846
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,200
to any Droplet I'm creating, add my key, and I can add Rekai's key, boom, boom, boom.

847
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,800
Now we all have SSH login to the new Droplet I've created.

848
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,160
There's so many nice things about the DigitalOcean UI.

849
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,280
You should totally check it out.

850
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
They also have a great API.

851
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,280
If you want to take advantage of some OSS code built around that API or you want to

852
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,960
write some yourself, they have a really nice interface.

853
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,800
But on top of that, they got locations, New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

854
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,120
London, Toronto, Germany, all up in that business.

855
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,440
Go get yourself a super fast, super fast Droplet.

856
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,000
And they start at $5 a month and they got Ubuntu.

857
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
They got Debian.

858
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
They have Fedora.

859
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
They have CentOS, CoreOS.

860
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And then you look at those hourly pricing, oh man.

861
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
That is really slick.

862
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,240
You can get a nice rig for like a couple hours and it pays very low.

863
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,220
You want to do something for a little while, no big deal.

864
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,760
If you have a horribly slow connection like I do at home, sometimes I'll spin up a DigitalOcean

865
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,460
Droplet to download my distro of choice over Torrent and then I'll just suck it down over

866
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,580
Wget later on.

867
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,640
Last night it was like 80 degrees in Seattle.

868
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,560
I didn't want my fan to kick on, but I wanted to compile a kernel, boom, DigitalOcean will

869
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,560
do it for you.

870
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,560
Seriously, it's nice.

871
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:46,120
Also, they have one-click deployments of software just ready to go and they have fantastic,

872
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:50,920
fantastic documentation, probably one that we've almost taken for granted.

873
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,840
How to install the LAMP stack, Apache MySQL, PHP on Ubuntu 16.04.

874
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:02,640
How to install NGINX, MySQL and PHP, the LIMP stack, LEMP, LIMP stack, which is NGINX on

875
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,920
Ubuntu.

876
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,200
How to install WordPress on Ubuntu.

877
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,880
What's new in Ubuntu in 16.04.

878
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,480
How to use NGINX and Let's Encrypt together.

879
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,440
An introduction to configuration management.

880
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,280
You can go from zero to like Linux Admin Hero on DigitalOcean.

881
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,800
Or you know what, it's not just Linux, it's also FreeBSD too.

882
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,520
I know, that's one of their more trickier things.

883
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,760
They also have extremely good documentation on FreeBSD.

884
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,960
But all the different distros, I mean everything they support, it's a really great, great service.

885
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,440
And you can use our promo code DOUNPLUCT to get a $10 credit, try out their $5 rig, two

886
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,760
months for free at DigitalOcean.com.

887
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,360
Big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

888
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,880
Okay Wes, I've talked about Subsonic before.

889
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,160
In fact, Subsonic, when people would come to me and they'd say, hey Chris, what are

890
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,800
you doing for media streaming?

891
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Hey Chris, what are you doing to listen to those sweet tunes?

892
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,200
Yeah, exactly.

893
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,840
Or what are you doing for podcast management?

894
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,280
And this was a big one, and man did I love it, dude.

895
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,240
I would have Subsonic centrally download my podcast and then I would listen to them and

896
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:13,200
oh man, Subsonic was a great way to essentially set up Plex for your audio.

897
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,440
And I had it installed, loved it, used the web UI, used all the different apps built

898
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,440
off of it.

899
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,880
Well, we have a little breaking news right here on the Unplugged program.

900
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,040
Subsonic is going closed source.

901
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,580
Starting with 6.0, Subsonic will no longer be open source.

902
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,840
The main reason, according to one of the developers, is that the source code now contains software

903
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:40,520
license codes that they purchased, literally what they said.

904
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:46,240
Software license codes that I have purchased that shouldn't be used by Fork Projects.

905
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,660
Now Subsonic West is one of these projects that has sort of been slowly moving towards

906
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,680
this position for a while.

907
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,200
It's one of these things that if you've been following the project, you kind of suspected

908
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
this was coming.

909
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,840
And it does happen from time to time in open source.

910
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,320
And a couple of first reactions come to me like, well, who the hell are you?

911
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
How dare you?

912
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,320
Right?

913
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
Of course, they're the developers and creators.

914
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
They get to do whatever they like.

915
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,020
Yeah, that's exactly who the hell they are.

916
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,640
And then my other reaction is, well, screw you.

917
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,280
I'll go find something else, right?

918
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,840
Forking Subsonic by.

919
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
Yeah.

920
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,160
Anybody in the Mamba Room a Subsonic user before I move on from that?

921
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,560
Because I think that's kind of a big deal.

922
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,400
If you've been dependent on this open source project, it's been around for years and years,

923
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,640
all of a sudden, closed source.

924
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,640
Yeah.

925
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,640
It sucks.

926
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,640
I understand like with the complexities, especially like the licensing open source and keeping

927
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,520
things free and open source is more difficult now than it's ever been.

928
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,800
Keeping straight all the licenses of the stuff that you actually use to assemble your product.

929
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,440
Anyway, Subsonic looked heavy handed to me anyway, but it still sucks.

930
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,440
It was efficacious.

931
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,440
Yeah.

932
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,920
Now, Wimpy, you're a Subsonics user and donator.

933
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,520
Tell me about Subsonics.

934
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,720
Well, there are several tools like this, but I've had good success with Subsonic over the

935
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
years.

936
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,840
And once you start building up your library, I've got not a DigitalOcean droplet, but a

937
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:11,520
VPS somewhere that runs my Subsonic stuff and it acts as offsite backup for our music.

938
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,540
And it's my on the internet streaming service.

939
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,960
So Subsonics is, is it a fork of Subsonic?

940
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,120
No, sorry.

941
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:30,000
Subsonic is what I'm using at the moment and yeah, and I understand there are forks of

942
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Subsonics that I haven't used.

943
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,880
And I've got a couple of that I'll talk about.

944
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,880
So you, you are using the project that has now gone closed source in the new version?

945
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,720
No, I haven't upgraded to the new version.

946
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,720
And how do you feel about this?

947
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,360
I mean, this is something, the only reason I ask you is because, you know, as longtime

948
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,080
Linux users, from time to time this happens.

949
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,640
Do you just roll with the punches when something like this happens or are you outraged and

950
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,880
ready to take to the streets with pitchforks and a fire?

951
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,360
I'm not outraged.

952
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,760
I'm a little bit disappointed because I thought the reason that I was donating to this project

953
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,880
was in order to keep it open source and now I've ended up funding a proprietary project.

954
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,760
So I'm not super enthusiastic about that.

955
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,240
This is my complaint right here.

956
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,000
You just, yeah.

957
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,080
I will be looking elsewhere in due course.

958
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,560
What about if it's just remains free?

959
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,840
Is that all it really takes, as long as it stays free, then you're good?

960
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,280
I'm talking free as in freedom, not free as in beer.

961
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,200
I have no problem paying for any, anything, like, you know, a service, you know, or like

962
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:41,120
a podcast, like, you know, like Unfilter or whatever, or NPR, or any sort of software

963
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:46,280
solution that's, you know, efficacious, I have no problem paying for it so long as it's

964
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,280
free.

965
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,240
I mean, it has to be, you know, free as in freedom, not free as in beer.

966
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,920
Trevor Burrus So like Wimpy just touched on, there are several

967
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
alternatives.

968
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,800
Now, Subsonic kind of, it gives you a centralized on your land Spotify using your own library

969
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,800
if you will.

970
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,680
It also, it works with multiple media formats.

971
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,040
It could also do some transcoding.

972
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,880
It is in a lot of ways a lot like Plex too.

973
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,160
It could go out and get metadata information, centralized playlists.

974
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:19,560
So in that sort of same vein, Madsonic is one that I've heard a lot.

975
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,600
Madsonic is a web-based media streamer.

976
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,760
It's a fork of Subsonic.

977
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,640
It is based on some Java.

978
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,840
It runs on Linux.

979
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,640
And one of the nice things about it, if you have constrained bandwidth, you can set upper

980
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,080
limits on the music and it can re-encode some of the music for you if you want to stream,

981
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,080
which is kind of nice.

982
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,320
Matthew Feeney That is very nice, especially on, you know,

983
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
you're on the bus or whatever.

984
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,460
Trevor Burrus Yeah.

985
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,120
And it's supposed to be easy to use.

986
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,520
If you have, you know, 100,000 files in your music library, you're not going to have any

987
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,520
problems.

988
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,780
It's GPLed.

989
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,000
And so that's, this is madsonic.org.

990
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,280
You can find it at beta.madsonic.org.

991
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,520
But you know, Wes, I'm going to tell you about the one that kind of caught my attention.

992
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,080
The one that I kind of liked was Cherry Music.

993
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,080
Matthew Feeney Ooh.

994
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,080
Trevor Burrus Yeah, same thing.

995
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,080
Matthew Feeney That's pretty cherry.

996
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:05,040
Trevor Burrus GPL, easy to set up, get a go, blazingly fast

997
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,040
search.

998
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,040
Yep.

999
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,040
They've got apps that work with it.

1000
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,040
It'll automatically go get the cover art.

1001
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,640
Super quick setup, which I think is really nice.

1002
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,200
Matthew Feeney I might stand this up pretty soon here.

1003
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,200
That looks awesome.

1004
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,200
Trevor Burrus Yeah, it does.

1005
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,200
Here, I'll show you a few screenshots.

1006
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,960
This is Cherry Music, kind of the same deal.

1007
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,280
For those of you that are familiar with Subsonic, the functionality will look familiar.

1008
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,280
Oh, the screen.

1009
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,720
Oh, there it goes.

1010
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,640
But the UI is a little nicer.

1011
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,400
So this is a really easy way to have like, if you want to have a bunch of your audio

1012
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,920
music on a central file server, but then have everyone have the same playlist throughout

1013
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,920
the house.

1014
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,960
This was always a problem that Angela and I had is we had the same music library a lot

1015
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,560
of the time where she'd have like, well actually for a long time she had her own library, I

1016
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,120
had my own library, we had our own playlists and all this.

1017
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,560
And then we wanted to like, well, we're going to have people over, let's have a playlist

1018
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,880
that plays in the living room.

1019
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,920
Okay, well whose computer did you know, and it was just like, oh, do you want to bring

1020
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,920
it up?

1021
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,920
Matthew Feeney Now you're choosing between them and switching.

1022
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,960
Trevor Burrus Yeah, and so then all the energy and effort

1023
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,960
goes into one spot.

1024
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,120
And that's why we set up Subsonic and we're able to have like party mix playlists and

1025
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,080
like Christmas playlists and she could go set it up on the thing and then I would just

1026
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,080
play it.

1027
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,080
Matthew Feeney That's awesome.

1028
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,080
Trevor Burrus It was a very nice setup.

1029
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,160
Plus, you're taking advantage of the centralized network storage at that point and you're just

1030
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,560
throwing this on top of it.

1031
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,280
So Cherry Music, which I like a lot, the URL is a little weird, so I'll just, you'll have

1032
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,840
to go find the link in the show notes, but I like that one.

1033
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,840
Amachi?

1034
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,840
Apanchi?

1035
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,840
Inagogo says it's…

1036
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,840
Matthew Feeney Ampachi?

1037
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,840
Trevor Burrus Ampachi.

1038
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,840
Ampachi.org.

1039
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,840
A-M-P-A-C-H-E.org.

1040
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:35,240
And also, it looks like Rekai is recommending Syrenza, which is another one there.

1041
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,240
Boy, there's a few of these.

1042
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,000
Cherry Music is the one I picked, but it looks like if you're in the chat room, you could

1043
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,640
totally score some links for a couple other alternatives as well.

1044
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,640
I'm going through all of them right now.

1045
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,600
There's a whole bunch in here.

1046
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
I like that one.

1047
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:54,000
You know, I should also mention, like Grandell is mentioning in the chat room, Plex is aggressively

1048
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,480
going after this category too.

1049
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,240
Plex is aggressively going after music.

1050
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,240
So this is another…

1051
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,240
Matthew Feeney I was about to say, yeah.

1052
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,960
Trevor Burrus This is bad timing on Subsonics' part because

1053
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,400
Plex is attempting to go this way too.

1054
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,320
Matthew Feeney And so many people have Plex at their house

1055
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,320
already.

1056
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,320
Trevor Burrus Well, Syrenza looks nice.

1057
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,320
This looks really nice, Rekai.

1058
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,320
Good find.

1059
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,320
That does look like a good one.

1060
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
And Ampachi.

1061
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,320
Ampachi.org.

1062
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,320
Ampachi or whatever.

1063
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,320
It looks really good too.

1064
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
Ooh, visualizers, Wes.

1065
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,320
Look at that.

1066
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,320
Hey, what's up?

1067
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,320
What's up?

1068
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,320
You get those visualizers.

1069
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,320
Yeah.

1070
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:28,320
So I guess I wanted to end just a quick note on…

1071
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,320
I don't know about you.

1072
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,320
You know what?

1073
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,040
I'll ask Wimpy because Wimpy has actually donated money.

1074
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,040
So let's ask Wimpy.

1075
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,560
Wimpy, did you have a sense this was coming?

1076
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:40,180
Because I'll be honest, I had a sense this was coming.

1077
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:45,800
Watching the Subsonic project, I had a feeling they were going this direction.

1078
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,960
Did you have that same feeling even as a donator?

1079
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,960
What was it?

1080
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,360
What was it that sort of set off your spider sense, if you will?

1081
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,320
Matthew Feeney It's the fact that when you install it, you

1082
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,760
have to put a license in to use it fully.

1083
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:09,800
It sort of very heavily influences you to donate in order to get a key.

1084
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:17,880
To use the product completely and it nags you and it felt like it was going this route.

1085
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:27,460
Some of the wording on the website sounded a bit plaintive about not getting the appropriate

1086
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:31,360
donations for the number of people using it and I just sort of got a sense that it was

1087
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,800
on its way.

1088
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,480
So yeah, I'm not surprised.

1089
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:41,360
I also am a Plex subscriber as well, but in my opinion, Plex isn't really there for music

1090
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,720
playback just yet.

1091
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:49,760
It's improved significantly in the last year or so, but it is not a good music manager

1092
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,280
and playlist organizer and player at all.

1093
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,160
Aaron Powell I agree.

1094
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,920
That's essentially my assessment of it too.

1095
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,360
So before we move, I did want to mention just really briefly the power management strategies.

1096
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:08,360
Is it still a thing in 2016 to go through a bunch of hoops to set up the perfect power

1097
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,200
management?

1098
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,040
And I ask you as someone who has sort of taken a backseat to this recently, I don't bother

1099
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,760
doing things like installing and configuring TLP.

1100
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,320
I don't really consider watching Power Top to see what's eating up all of my battery.

1101
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:29,480
I just assume that in 2016 I can install a modern operating system and not have to worry

1102
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,060
about power management.

1103
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,060
But maybe I'm wrong.

1104
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,060
And I'll start Wimpy with you.

1105
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,440
It sounds like you still think TLP is worth loading on if you have a laptop, correct?

1106
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,920
Wimpy Wimpy Yep.

1107
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:42,760
It's installed by default in Ubuntu Mate, has been for several releases now.

1108
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,800
Aaron Powell Now, what do you notice the difference?

1109
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,320
I mean, it must be a huge difference to make it default.

1110
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,480
Wimpy Wimpy Personally, I've noticed a significant difference

1111
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,760
in the power savings.

1112
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,280
That combined with managing your screen brightness appropriately because that can make a big difference.

1113
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:04,200
But there was another podcaster recently installed Ubuntu Mate on their main laptop.

1114
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:09,760
I won't say what distribution they replaced, but they were quoting a two-hour battery life

1115
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,200
improvement as a result of installing Ubuntu Mate.

1116
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,760
And the only significant difference there is that it comes pre-installed with TLP.

1117
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:22,280
And on some of my older computers, I can definitely measure the improvement in hours rather than

1118
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,280
minutes.

1119
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,280
Aaron Powell Hmm, Skookie, you said yes, definitely, if you're

1120
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,280
using Arch.

1121
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,280
Why do you say that?

1122
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,200
Wimpy Wimpy Oh, well, okay.

1123
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,440
So about three years ago, and I don't know if you remember this, but I got a Galaga Ultra

1124
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,800
Pro from System76.

1125
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,880
And I slapped Integra, I still run Arch on that.

1126
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,040
It's great.

1127
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,040
It's awesome.

1128
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:50,720
But in order to get anything other than like, literally, basic, basic, I mean, we're talking

1129
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:57,360
like, I would get like an hour and 15 minutes out of the battery until you had to go through

1130
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:04,640
the whole Arch horrific documentation, you know, that whole hour and a half long wall

1131
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,560
of text to configure everything appropriately.

1132
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,360
But now, you know, like I get, you know, four and a half hours.

1133
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,520
It's an older laptop, but it's still awesome.

1134
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,340
Aaron Powell Okay, Popey, I'm turning to you because I'm

1135
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,600
hoping you're going to tell me.

1136
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:18,840
I do nothing.

1137
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:23,800
I install Ubuntu, and I use it like a regular user and I get great battery life.

1138
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,800
Is that true?

1139
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,760
Or does Popey jump through hoops to get good battery life?

1140
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,160
Wimpy Wimpy So I recently had to reinstall on my new laptop.

1141
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:36,360
And I just installed it and I didn't do anything at all.

1142
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:42,360
However, I have somewhat worked around the issue, because my laptop has two batteries,

1143
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:45,880
one internal and one external, and I bought a second battery.

1144
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:52,280
So in the event that my power dies, I can just swap out the battery while I'm running

1145
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,280
and not have a problem.

1146
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,840
So I've kind of worked around the problem.

1147
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,700
Aaron Powell So you're kind of like I am sort of like that

1148
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,960
because with the Bonobo, the battery life was going to be two and a half hours, three

1149
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,380
hours regardless after a couple of years, right?

1150
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,120
It's a big desktop killer with a small and I just got I just became honey badger about

1151
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,680
the battery.

1152
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:13,360
But here I am with the Apollo now it was Skylake and I'm getting almost six hours without a

1153
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,360
lot of effort.

1154
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,960
And I'm starting to think, all right, well, maybe if I dial this in a little bit because

1155
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,200
I was in the middle of an awesome Minecraft mod exploration with the kids last night and

1156
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,640
then my battery died and I and my dad, my son was like, Dad, why didn't you bring your

1157
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,640
power cord?

1158
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,680
Well, I normally I don't need it.

1159
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,320
I didn't plan on running Java, son.

1160
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,320
I mean, right.

1161
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,320
Oh, my God.

1162
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:40,400
Do you ever just run power top and change all the configurable and this is the other

1163
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,400
thing is I have in the past, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1164
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,920
This is CNN breaking news.

1165
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:55,880
Wimpy you're telling me seven hours and 30 minutes on your Apollo.

1166
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,880
Yes, comfortably.

1167
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,880
And it's OK.

1168
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:58,880
All right.

1169
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,880
There you go.

1170
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:00,880
I got to do it.

1171
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,200
I mean, if I could get another hour and a half out of my machine.

1172
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,200
Yeah.

1173
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,200
Holy smokes.

1174
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,040
I will say I also was using that Apricity OS, which based on Arch for a while, they

1175
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,520
have TLP installed by default.

1176
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,160
And that also I've noticed is run for quite a long time.

1177
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,160
All right.

1178
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,160
I'm going to put it looks here.

1179
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,160
Look at the archway.

1180
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,440
You pretty much just install it and start it and I'm going to do it.

1181
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,600
I'm going to have no excuse.

1182
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,600
I will give it a go.

1183
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,000
I'm going to put the link in the show notes.

1184
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,600
If you guys are curious about that, I will toss it in there.

1185
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,000
So it sounds like TLP in 2016.

1186
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Still worth doing.

1187
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Not that I didn't think it was.

1188
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,400
I'm just a little disappointed.

1189
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,640
Is that weird?

1190
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:38,160
I just wish that I just I guess I look at I look at like those love the frickin MacBook

1191
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:43,000
with the single USB port that supposedly gets 12 years of battery life and you breathe on

1192
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,160
it and it gets another two hours of battery life just by like breathing on it.

1193
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,080
I look at that and I go, man, I wish we had something kind of similar to that.

1194
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:55,120
But then with the Apollo, I get so damn close.

1195
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,960
Just seems like it might be worth a little bit.

1196
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,600
And the TLP setup requires no config.

1197
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,600
All right.

1198
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,600
Well, there you go.

1199
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,600
Yeah.

1200
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,600
So there you go.

1201
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,600
That seems like the way to go.

1202
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,600
Not to report back next week.

1203
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,600
See how long you can go.

1204
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,600
Yeah.

1205
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,120
I mean, I was also considering for a little while doing battery life tests more more like

1206
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,120
standardized.

1207
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,120
Yeah.

1208
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,760
But to me, it's a lot of work.

1209
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,000
It also it seems like it's so dependent on your workload, like your screen brightness

1210
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,080
is a huge part of it.

1211
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,840
So it feels like a little bit of black magic.

1212
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:23,960
Like people can talk big, but you have to put in a fair bit to like get a workload that

1213
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,920
you can use as an example consistently.

1214
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,920
Yeah.

1215
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:27,920
Yeah.

1216
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,920
Yeah.

1217
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,920
Yeah.

1218
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,920
OK.

1219
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:31,920
And you know what?

1220
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,960
If those of you out there in the audience have experimented a little bit with TLP and

1221
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,200
your different experience, I would just be I would like to know.

1222
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,920
I would like to know what you have seen out there.

1223
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,440
So links to everything we've talked about so far, including Cherry Music, Madsonic, TLP

1224
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,560
and all that stuff over at Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1225
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:52,560
Just go look for episode 143 of the Unplugged program.

1226
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:59,480
We are about to talk a little bit about Linux containers, yes, Linux containers, everybody,

1227
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:04,580
and how they can be relevant to you and I. Wes, you are a soldier, sir.

1228
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:10,000
You have experimented and gone off and upgraded a bunch of your servers to Ubuntu 16.04.

1229
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
That's right.

1230
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,200
You've begun experimenting with Linux containers.

1231
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,920
So before we get to all of that, I want to mention Linux Academy.

1232
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:22,360
If I say the word container and you go, I don't actually know what that means.

1233
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:26,920
If that thought has crossed the back of your head, maybe you should check out Linux Academy.

1234
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,580
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

1235
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:32,680
Go there to take advantage of the unplugged discount and support this show.

1236
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,680
Linux Academy.

1237
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,600
Just so you guys know, this is the essentials created by people that love Linux and want

1238
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,600
to spread the word.

1239
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:43,020
They wanted a platform, so they went and found a great group of developers and enthusiasts.

1240
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,020
They came together.

1241
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:45,200
They created the Linux Academy.

1242
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:50,460
They now have 2,379 self-paced courses, comprehensive study guides you get to download.

1243
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:55,200
You can be like a Skookie Sprite there and listen in the shower, download them.

1244
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,200
I love that story.

1245
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,840
And you know, Seth might have been the first person to tell me that he listens in the shower,

1246
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,000
but he was certainly not the last person to tell me that, which I think is kind of funny.

1247
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,040
They have scenario-based labs, which will put you right in the middle of every day,

1248
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,040
common tasks.

1249
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,540
They have nuggets that will go deep into one single topic, you know, might last about

1250
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:14,040
two minutes, might be an hour, depends on the topic.

1251
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,040
They have live events.

1252
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,520
They have instructor mentoring, which is huge.

1253
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,600
They'll teach you how to use all of the technology around Linux, the essentials, the advanced

1254
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:24,520
topics and the stuff that will make you money on Linux, the stuff you can use to improve

1255
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:29,320
your career, the stuff you can use to charge clients, the stuff you can use to better your

1256
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,320
knowledge set.

1257
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,400
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1258
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,920
Graded server exercises will give you real results.

1259
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,920
It's nice.

1260
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,600
Seven plus distros to choose from.

1261
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,160
They're always updating the content.

1262
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:47,920
You know, I talked about containers kind of jokingly, but seriously, I can't envision

1263
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,180
a better resource to learn more about containers.

1264
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:52,160
Like they are passionate about this stuff.

1265
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,920
They were writing a courseware on Docker while other people were joking about it.

1266
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,000
They understand where things are going because they are so enthusiastic about this and they

1267
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,640
have a great, great set of courseware on containers.

1268
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,480
Now we're about to get into containers and if anything we talk about intrigues you, go

1269
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:12,480
check them out at LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1270
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,480
All right, Mr. West.

1271
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:19,160
So you said to me, OK, Chris, I know we've talked about Ubuntu 16.04 a lot, but let's

1272
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,280
be real.

1273
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,520
We've mostly focused on the desktop where we've trashed on it a little bit.

1274
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,960
I mean, does anyone even use Linux on the desktop?

1275
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,960
I don't know.

1276
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:27,960
No, I kid.

1277
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,960
Obviously.

1278
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,960
Oh, my gosh.

1279
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,960
Oh, my gosh.

1280
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,240
But, you know, there's the whole other element of the Ubuntu server.

1281
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,720
The server where it's actually hugely successful.

1282
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,120
So have you used it at all?

1283
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,120
Yeah.

1284
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,120
Oh, yeah.

1285
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,120
Yeah.

1286
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,920
André, wait, do I have any local 16.04 servers?

1287
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,920
No.

1288
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:47,920
No, I don't.

1289
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,080
I only have, I only have digital ocean droplets, but we've got a handful of them now.

1290
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,240
And I don't really have anything to say.

1291
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,720
I guess that's a good thing.

1292
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,000
Yeah, they just they just freaking run.

1293
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,880
We've set up a software on them.

1294
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,640
We have some 14.04 droplets.

1295
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,840
We want to move to 16.04 because we I'll tell you one.

1296
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,840
OK, OK, OK.

1297
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,680
I'll tell you one thing that I have noticed.

1298
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,680
OK.

1299
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:15,480
It is a pain in the ass now to like it is a major pain in the ass to write and it scripts

1300
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,720
for upstart.

1301
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,880
And it's like the last thing I want to do.

1302
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,640
It's the last thing anybody on the JB crew wants to do is learn upstart at this point.

1303
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,640
Oh, my gosh.

1304
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:24,640
Yes.

1305
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,640
Who wants to learn upstart?

1306
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,640
No.

1307
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,640
It's dead.

1308
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,640
Yeah, exactly.

1309
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,640
And here's the other thing is that tons of the projects I've been using for a while now

1310
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,640
have system dnit scripts.

1311
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,640
Yep.

1312
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,640
They come.

1313
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,640
They're right there.

1314
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,640
Yes.

1315
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,640
Yes.

1316
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,640
Yes.

1317
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,640
So that is sort of the nicest thing about 16.04 is now I'm just like looking.

1318
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:43,000
I can use those examples and things, but that's pretty much the entire summary of my review

1319
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
from servers.

1320
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
It works.

1321
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I don't really have any complaints.

1322
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,200
And it does everything I expect, which, by the way, exactly what I want on my server.

1323
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,200
It just it just it.

1324
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,200
Yeah, it's consistent.

1325
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,880
So you, however, you, however, have had a bit of a bigger route.

1326
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,880
I'm in the weird position of like, I mean, I use arch for a lot of things.

1327
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,920
It's the most what I'm most familiar these days with I know how to, you know, bend it

1328
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,240
to my will get whatever I done need to do done with it.

1329
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,000
I'm in the position where I'm considering switching to Ubuntu for for a lot of my larger

1330
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:15,880
services, mostly because of Lex D as they call it, which is Lex D 2.0 is just released

1331
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:21,760
and that's their container lighter visor, they jokingly call it and it's and it's meant

1332
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:27,600
to be a new way to interact with the Linux container or Lexi subsystem in the infrastructure

1333
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,600
they've set up.

1334
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,160
So if you're not familiar, you can go to Linux containers.com, I believe.

1335
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:38,280
Yeah, Linux containers.org, dot org, backslash, Alex deep backslash, try dash it, which we

1336
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,280
will have a link in the show.

1337
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,720
And you can give it a try right now.

1338
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,240
And it's a now hold on.

1339
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,880
When you say give it a try.

1340
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:48,920
You mean I can go to a web page and I can spin up a Alex D container in real time?

1341
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,920
Yeah, let's do it.

1342
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:50,920
Let's do it right now.

1343
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:51,920
You want to do it?

1344
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,920
OK, here we go.

1345
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:59,600
So I am at Linux containers.org, slash Alex D, slash try dash it again, link in the show.

1346
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,600
Yeah, where's the IPv6 connectivity, Chris?

1347
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,600
Oh, the studio.

1348
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,600
I know, right?

1349
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,680
So I'm going to say I've accepted the terms of service because, of course, I do.

1350
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,680
They're pretty reasonable.

1351
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,320
Now, they are going to start the container on the fly now because we just gave up the

1352
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,320
URL.

1353
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,320
It's going to get slow here.

1354
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:16,960
But before it gets slow, you can see right here, Wes, right here, boom, I got a console.

1355
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,880
I got an Alex D container.

1356
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,320
I'm now root inside a container nested inside an Alex D install, which is sort of like Alex

1357
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,320
D inception.

1358
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,320
Yes, right.

1359
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,320
What am I seeing here, Wes?

1360
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,320
What am I seeing?

1361
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:32,080
You're seeing they ran Alex C exec container name bash, and it just gets you executed as

1362
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:34,720
root inside the container, a bash shell.

1363
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:35,720
This is pretty cool.

1364
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,880
This is a pretty cool way to do it.

1365
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,880
Yeah, it's pretty neat.

1366
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:41,600
So one of the neat things that they've Alex C was pretty complicated to use.

1367
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,780
It's really neat to use if you've ever tried it, if you need like system level containers.

1368
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,800
But there's a lot of things to learn and a lot of configuration things to set up.

1369
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,800
Sure.

1370
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,920
Alex D or Alex D, it's a lot simpler.

1371
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,840
And so you can kind of just get an image going and they have default profiles set up.

1372
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:02,640
So the default one, it runs as an unprivileged container, meaning that it actually runs in

1373
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,680
a user namespace.

1374
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,000
So that root in the container is no longer root on your host.

1375
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,600
It's actually matched to like UID 1 million or something like that.

1376
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,600
So hopefully that get you some added security.

1377
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,680
But it also has like default profiles if you want to run Docker in there, you just change

1378
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,400
your container to be on the Docker profile and they tweak some of the security settings

1379
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:26,800
and the like nesting settings so that you can run Docker inside your container.

1380
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,920
So you're just starting to play with this.

1381
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:28,920
But how's the workflow?

1382
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,920
But is it pretty easy to use?

1383
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:30,920
It's neat.

1384
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,640
So Alex C used kind of a template workflow, so where you'd use something like pack strap

1385
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:37,880
or bootstrap or whatever to like get your container implemented on the machine you're

1386
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:38,880
running it on.

1387
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,640
Lex D uses an image-based format, so you actually just have like a tar gz of your container

1388
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:46,640
root file system.

1389
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,120
And it also takes great advantage of ZFS.

1390
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,120
It's awesome.

1391
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:54,320
So like in 16.04 you just install the userland tools, the kernel module is built for you,

1392
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,580
you just load that up.

1393
01:02:55,580 --> 01:03:02,040
It has a pseudo LXD in it and it'll walk you through and it'll even set you up like a loopback

1394
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,860
mounted ZFS file system if you want.

1395
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,520
So that's what I'm using on the laptop here.

1396
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:09,320
Or if you want to have, you know, you have actual like pool of disk to use, you can use

1397
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,300
that or use one that you already have.

1398
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:15,480
And so what that means is when you want to use like a new, they give you some image servers

1399
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,960
by default with the like, you know, Ubuntu 16.04 container image.

1400
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,240
You can just pull that down.

1401
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,680
But once you have that image, every new container you start, it's just a copy on write copy

1402
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,680
of that, right?

1403
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,080
So it's basically free except for what you change it.

1404
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,080
That's slick.

1405
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,680
And all, again, super easy to set up.

1406
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,480
And I've already set up like an archiver.

1407
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,560
So they don't have, they have like Alpine, they have Fedora.

1408
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:40,760
So you're saying, you're saying you have, okay, so for example, if I were to do this

1409
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:46,960
on a, on a droplet, I could have an Ubuntu 16.04 droplet, but in the container run arch.

1410
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,960
Yep, absolutely.

1411
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,280
So they don't have one provided on there.

1412
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:55,240
They have like an image, images.linuxcontainers.org, where they have like Fedora, Cora, like lots

1413
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:58,160
of prebuilt stuff for you, but arch wasn't one of them.

1414
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,320
But you just take a, you know, you make a reasonable arch file system, you package it

1415
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:03,960
up in a tar and it's really easy to get it as your own.

1416
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,240
Then you can, they, the other neat thing is it's a networked, like it's all done over

1417
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,360
a REST API.

1418
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:09,900
That's like, that's how the client talks to it.

1419
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:10,900
That's how you can talk to it.

1420
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,920
They have Python bindings and it also talks over the network.

1421
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,700
So I can have a server here and then a server on a droplet somewhere and I can go make myself

1422
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,320
a new image, have containers here.

1423
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:23,400
And if I make a container I really like here, I can just push it over to the server and

1424
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,400
it will run there.

1425
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,400
That is nice.

1426
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,400
Talk about rapid development.

1427
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,160
You can even snapshot up here, then push the snapshot up to this.

1428
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,160
It's I'm really excited.

1429
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,640
I might have to change a lot of my infrastructure to use this now.

1430
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:38,120
That is super, super neat and sounds like it didn't take a ton of time to figure out

1431
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,120
how to get down.

1432
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,120
I'm consistently surprised with how easy it is.

1433
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,120
Huh.

1434
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,120
I got to play with that.

1435
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,120
Cool.

1436
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,120
Okay.

1437
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,520
So the chat room has been talking about a topic, Wes, that I want to cover before I

1438
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:53,600
get to my Lara Croft review because there has been something we have done a few times

1439
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,000
on the show is we've given Mr. Leo Laporte a hard time.

1440
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,320
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

1441
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,440
About his Linux coverage.

1442
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:05,320
And so I feel like it's only fair when Leo sits down and does his homework and does a

1443
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:08,400
pretty good job of it at that, that we give it some attention.

1444
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,620
So I want to just play a moment from the recent, the new screensavers on some help he gave

1445
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:13,620
on Linux.

1446
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:14,620
On the line.

1447
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:17,800
Let's do it.

1448
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,720
On the line with us right now.

1449
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,280
I don't know your name, sir.

1450
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,280
Who is this?

1451
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:25,280
Jason.

1452
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,280
Jason is on the line.

1453
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,280
Hi, Jason.

1454
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,280
Where are you calling from?

1455
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,280
Hi, Leo.

1456
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,280
Calling from Manhattan, Kansas.

1457
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,280
I want to talk to you.

1458
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,280
There he is.

1459
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,120
So, Jason, tell us, tell us your question.

1460
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:38,440
Well, I've been a long time Linux, sorry, Linux user.

1461
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,920
I grew up calling it Linux.

1462
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:40,920
I know.

1463
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:41,920
I know.

1464
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:42,920
A lot of people did.

1465
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,920
Yeah.

1466
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,560
But I've got a handful of older computers, netbooks.

1467
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:50,000
We're talking core two duos, nothing really older than that.

1468
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,600
I've tried some of the slimmed down versions of Linux, either Laboon 2 or LXDE, even Puppy

1469
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,600
Linux.

1470
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,600
Puppy's a little too techie.

1471
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:04,040
I'd like something that, a slimmed down version that'll run well, looking to run Flash, DVDs.

1472
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,040
Flash?

1473
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,040
Flash.

1474
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,040
I know.

1475
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,040
Still trying to run YouTube.

1476
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,800
Well, you don't need YouTube, doesn't need Flash anymore, so you can...

1477
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,800
Oh, that's true.

1478
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:14,800
You're right.

1479
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,800
Yeah.

1480
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,800
I'm hoping that...

1481
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:17,800
By the way, who needs Flash?

1482
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,800
Twit.tv still runs Flash, because we use a player.

1483
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:24,120
We don't have control of it that plays back Ustream and BitGravity, and they're using

1484
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,120
Flash.

1485
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,400
Although they're moving away from it, as our providers do.

1486
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,520
I'm hoping we won't see Flash much longer.

1487
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,520
It's dying, as everybody knows.

1488
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,960
As it should.

1489
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:33,960
So...

1490
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:37,360
I'm looking for suggestions for something else that's...

1491
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:42,560
Maybe not something else, but a different spin of Linux that works well with older hardware,

1492
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,560
but not too techie.

1493
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:48,080
Something that I can put on it and basically hand to my mom.

1494
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,080
There's the kicker.

1495
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,960
Unfortunately, this is almost a contradiction in terms, right?

1496
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,320
I think this is kind of non-intuitive, but I've always said that the more a person is

1497
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,000
a novice, the better the computer they need.

1498
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,560
Not the vice versa, because...

1499
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,560
So he's been...

1500
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,560
The vice versa.

1501
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,560
He's been talking about Linux a lot.

1502
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:06,440
He goes into a whole description here about Cinnamon.

1503
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,440
He does a whole...

1504
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,440
Professor Leo.

1505
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,440
Yeah.

1506
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,440
He gets all...

1507
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:15,420
We use this kind of generic term Linux for something that's really so much more.

1508
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,880
The only thing that's Linux is the stuff way down here.

1509
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,000
This is the kernel.

1510
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,180
And that's the stuff that Linus Torvalds wrote back in 1994 or 92 when he was a graduate

1511
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,960
student in Finland.

1512
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:29,960
He wrote...

1513
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:30,960
I feel like I'm in school.

1514
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:31,960
What's nice about...

1515
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:32,960
I know.

1516
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,960
And you know what's funny about this?

1517
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,160
And I'll leave the link in the show notes if you guys want to watch the whole thing.

1518
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:41,200
What's funny about this is it tells me two things about Linux adoption.

1519
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,200
Number one, we are so screwed.

1520
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:45,360
And number two, it's great to have Leo as an advocate.

1521
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,360
Yeah, it is.

1522
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:51,120
The first thing it tells me is, and I'm not joking when I say this, you need a fricking

1523
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:54,640
whiteboard if you're a Windows or Mac user to figure out, or I'm sorry, chalkboard in

1524
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,600
this case, how to use Linux.

1525
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,760
Like Leo talks about the fact that he has a dozen thumb drives with different Linux

1526
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,760
distros on there.

1527
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,880
He talks about trying Debian.

1528
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:02,940
He talks about trying Mint.

1529
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,040
He talks about trying Zubuntu and Unity.

1530
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,560
And he talks about trying Antigros.

1531
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:13,520
He has gone through a sludge of crap to get to where he's at now.

1532
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,520
It's too much.

1533
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,520
Right.

1534
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,080
It takes an average savvy Windows user to do what he's done.

1535
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:20,080
So anyways, it's interesting.

1536
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,080
And I'm glad he's trying it.

1537
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,080
And it's a good advocate.

1538
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,840
But yeah, he actually seems to know what he's talking about.

1539
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:25,840
I'm impressed.

1540
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,840
Yeah.

1541
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,840
Yeah.

1542
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:36,360
Now maybe he could play with LXDE and LXD or LXC, not LXDE, and tell us what he thinks.

1543
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,360
Yeah.

1544
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,840
I'm excited about that, Wes.

1545
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,840
OK.

1546
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,840
So let's get to it.

1547
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:42,920
I've been teasing it all episode.

1548
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,800
Tomb Raider is finally here for Linux.

1549
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:52,240
The 2013 edition of Tomb Raider is available for Linux.

1550
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,480
And I had a chance to give it a try.

1551
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,320
And I've got to say, I'm not too disappointed.

1552
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:06,720
If you're watching here, Wes, this was something I played a little bit earlier on the livestream.

1553
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,120
This was me playing a little Tomb Raider.

1554
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,640
And the graphics are pretty good.

1555
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,520
Now if you're watching this back on the video version, you're watching an encoding of an

1556
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,520
encoding.

1557
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,520
So you know, the graphics are going to be what they are.

1558
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,520
Careful.

1559
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,880
But I'll tell you, this game is fun.

1560
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,840
First of all, it's very immersive.

1561
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:33,480
The one downside I'll have is there's a lot of quick time events, like this right here.

1562
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,480
You're running around.

1563
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,480
All of a sudden, it just takes over.

1564
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:36,480
Now you just watch.

1565
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:49,440
You have like a token key you have to press from time to time.

1566
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:52,760
But they do a good job of making Lara Croft feel like a real character.

1567
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,760
That's awesome.

1568
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:54,760
Yeah.

1569
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,800
And I'll tell you, Wes, I have a special connection.

1570
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,800
Look at that.

1571
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:00,800
Very painful.

1572
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,800
Yeah.

1573
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,640
They are violent with Lara in this game.

1574
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:04,640
They get really rough.

1575
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,640
Lara.

1576
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:06,640
They are.

1577
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,640
They are.

1578
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:10,080
They are really rough with her, like ridiculously so.

1579
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,640
But you know, when I first played Tomb Raider, it was when I had a Matrox video card and

1580
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,640
I upgraded it.

1581
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,640
Oh, Matrox.

1582
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:16,640
Never heard that name for a while.

1583
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,640
I know.

1584
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:18,840
And I popped in four megabytes of VRAM.

1585
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,840
I had a grand total from two megabytes to four megabytes.

1586
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,320
And my four, my two megabyte upgrade came with the Tomb Raider CD.

1587
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,320
Oh, very cool.

1588
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,320
Yeah.

1589
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,320
That was my first Tomb Raider experience.

1590
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,320
I remember the original Tomb Raider.

1591
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,320
Yeah.

1592
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:34,760
So even though it's a 2013 game, it's still very fun for me to be able to try it.

1593
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,320
And it supports Linux mail.

1594
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,320
The graphics are great.

1595
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,320
Yeah.

1596
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,320
It looks beautiful.

1597
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,320
Yeah.

1598
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,320
Sorry.

1599
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:48,760
The actress who does the voice work for Lara Croft, Keely Hawes, was recently on a TV

1600
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:54,800
program talking about this, you know, and the work that she had to do and how much work

1601
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,680
that she did in this new Lara Croft thing.

1602
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:02,560
And she talked about the fact that her son loves to play the game and it's a bit weird

1603
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,680
for her to hear her own voice screaming out at her son.

1604
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:07,680
Yeah.

1605
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,680
But it's awesome.

1606
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:12,760
Yeah, it is very cool to see these great games coming to Linux.

1607
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:19,280
And yeah, it's maybe not the best game ever, but I've really enjoyed playing it.

1608
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,880
So if you're looking to buy a Steam game-

1609
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,640
How are the system requirements, Chris?

1610
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,600
Well, you got to have, that's actually one of the nice things I like about it is you

1611
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,800
got to have, while you do have to have a decent system, Wes, they have a built in benchmark.

1612
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,800
Oh, nice.

1613
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:31,960
So here, I'll launch it right now.

1614
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,400
So you can get a sense of if it's going to work on your rig.

1615
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,600
And I know how nice of a machine you have now.

1616
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,920
Oh, so, and I don't know, Mr. Skookiesprite, have you had a chance to try out the new Tomb

1617
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:42,920
Raider?

1618
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,840
You know, doing your best Linux games podcast, you got to be trying these things, right?

1619
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,840
Are you kidding?

1620
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:52,520
I beat it in the first 14 hours of it coming out for Linux.

1621
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,600
It like launched on Steam at like 11 o'clock at night.

1622
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:00,760
I was just going to bed and I'm like, oh, Tomb Raider, okay, well, I better probably

1623
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:01,760
play this.

1624
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:07,480
So I played it in one 10 hour sitting, and then I had meetings that morning and three

1625
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,760
hours later, I finished it off 10 hours later.

1626
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:10,760
I think it's awesome.

1627
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,040
It's one of the best adventure games I've ever played.

1628
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,580
And it's easily the best looking game I've ever played on Linux.

1629
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:21,360
So I'm running the benchmark right now, which you say, benchmarks not so accurate, is it?

1630
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:27,080
Oh, God, no, it's like, on mine, it says like the average is like, the average frame rate

1631
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,880
is like 222 frames per second or something like that.

1632
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,160
It's just out of control.

1633
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,200
It's like, it's old and weird.

1634
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:37,680
So what I think it is, is I actually think that, I don't, I get like 80 or something.

1635
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,680
I can't remember.

1636
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,680
I'm benchmarking right now.

1637
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:40,680
I'll tell you in a second.

1638
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,600
But I think the game still has some glitches under Linux.

1639
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,520
There's a few performance glitches here and there.

1640
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:50,040
I'll get a one benchmark for the frame rate and then I end up with a completely different

1641
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,400
thing during gameplay.

1642
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,420
But as you watch this benchmark, you can see they add cool effects and stuff.

1643
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,420
It's pretty nice.

1644
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:56,880
Go ahead, Scooby.

1645
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,640
One of the things that's weird, because like the second I beat it, I started playing it

1646
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,920
again because that's how much I enjoyed it on hard.

1647
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:10,280
And this time, I had some problems with janky camera angles in my first 20 hours of the

1648
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,280
game.

1649
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,800
And it seems like either they pushed an update to it or something, but I have not had any

1650
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,120
camera problems.

1651
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:22,840
And especially if you run it on normal instead of like high, to like the settings, it makes

1652
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,160
a big difference in the performance because it cuts down on the reflections, I think.

1653
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,160
Yeah, I agree.

1654
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,280
The benchmark is a little crazy.

1655
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,400
So I just got on the benchmark.

1656
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,880
I got 80.6 minimum as my minimum frames per second.

1657
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:37,120
And I got max of 170.3 with an average of...

1658
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:39,600
Yeah, that's not happening.

1659
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,820
That's crazy.

1660
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,320
That's totally crazy.

1661
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,320
That's so ridiculous.

1662
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,040
It's like during the menus.

1663
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,040
Yeah.

1664
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:51,880
Well, it's like they do like this cool panorama view where they like load more and more stuff.

1665
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:55,880
So you'd think it'd be accurate, but it's got to be like some sort of best case scenario.

1666
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:56,880
I don't know.

1667
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:01,040
A couple of other just quick notes, Steam Sync works, so I played it for a little bit

1668
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,040
on my computer upstairs.

1669
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,040
It's able to resume right away.

1670
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,040
Oh, I love that.

1671
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,040
Yeah.

1672
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:08,640
Also, Linux Game Cast and the Linux Gamer gave some great reviews of this game.

1673
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,520
I'll have links to those in the show notes.

1674
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,920
And Mr. Skookiesprite, again, give people a plug where they can find your podcast.

1675
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,480
I assume you'll be talking about this.

1676
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,480
Oh, yeah.

1677
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,440
No, I already reviewed it on Saturday.

1678
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,440
Atta boy.

1679
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,440
Atta boy.

1684
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:28,560
I will have a link to that as well in the show notes, so that way you guys can follow

1685
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,880
the reviews of all of that.

1686
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:33,940
I'm excited to see a good game come out because this was like one of my first, like, I built

1687
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:38,940
a PC and then I upgraded from two megabytes of VRAM to four megabytes and got Tomb Raider.

1688
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:40,440
So yeah, right?

1689
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:41,600
That was a big deal for me.

1690
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,600
I really thought that was huge.

1691
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,560
Anyways, that'll pretty much wrap us up for this week's episode of The Unplugged Program.

1692
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,740
If you want to give us some feedback.

Or jupyterbroadcasting.com.

1698
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:57,720
Slash contact.

1699
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:01,920
Mumble room, is there anything else that the collective hive mind wants to cover before

1700
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,840
we wrap up on this week's episode?

1701
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,840
Going once.

1702
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,840
Going twice.

1703
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:15,600
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

1704
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,600
Oh!

1705
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:17,600
And there you have it.

1706
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,600
There you have it.

1707
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:23,480
RMS runs GNU slash K Windows.

1708
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,360
Thank you for joining us on this week's episode of The Unplugged Program.

1709
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,360
We do it over at jblive.tv.

1710
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:33,000

1711
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,000
zone.

1712
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Like we said earlier, LinuxActionShow.reddit.com is where you go.

1713
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Now that virtual log, that's powered by Mumble.

1714
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Woo!

1715
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Open source software.

1716
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Yes it is.

1717
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,100
And you can find out more about it by doing Bang Mumble in our IRC room, which is irc.geekshed.net.

1718
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:50,080

We'd love to see you there.

1720
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,080
Okay everybody.

1721
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,400
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Unplugged.

1722
01:15:54,400 --> 01:16:22,480
And we'll see you right back here, next Tuesday!

1723
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:38,640
Hot tip from crack editor Rekai.

1724
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,360
It looks like the Steam Controller is on sale right now.

1725
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,240
Have you ever given that another chance?

1726
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,520
You know, I should, huh?

1727
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,520
Especially with newer kernels?

1728
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,520
40% off.

1729
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,840
It seems like it might be worth time to give it another chance.

1730
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:49,840
That's a good deal.

1731
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,840
That is a good deal.

1732
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:57,280
So you know, when I shaved the stache on Sunday, I didn't think about how the children would

1733
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,280
react.

1734
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,280
Oh right, that's a big deal.

1735
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,960
I remember when my dad shaved his beard as a young child.

1736
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:02,960
Yes!

1737
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:03,960
It's like, who are you?

1738
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:07,420
It is actually a big deal, and I totally didn't think about that, because I remember when

1739
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,920
my dad had a beard and then went to no beard.

1740
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:10,920
It's a big deal.

1741
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:12,020
It was a big deal!

1742
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:18,800
And so I shaved on Sunday afternoon, right, and then I saw the kids Monday.

1743
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,400
And I gotta tell you, the reaction was not good.

1744
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,400
No.

1745
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,080
Abby told me it was dumb.

1746
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,640
Oh, wow, that's cold.

1747
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,200
But you know what Dylan told me?

1748
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:32,480
Dad, my dream is to grow a beard and a mustache.

1749
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,480
How could you shave it?

1750
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:34,480
That's what my son said.

1751
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,480
So how'd you explain it?

1752
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,480
Did you tell him?

1753
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,480
Dad, it's too funny.

1754
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,200
Uncle Noah did too well.

1755
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:44,080
And then my youngest, my youngest said, Daddy, did you do that for Noah?

1756
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,600
And I said, yes, Bella, I did it for Noah.

1757
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,020
I hate Noah now.

1758
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,020
He took the beard away.

1759
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:51,440
You know what Bella said?

1760
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:52,440
It's okay, Daddy.

1761
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:53,440
I still like your hair.

1762
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:58,520
I love my kids, dude.

1763
01:17:58,520 --> 01:17:59,520
So perfect.

1764
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,280
So it was like, yeah, okay, good, good, that makes me feel better.

1765
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,920
But all of them unanimously agreed, I gotta grow it back.

1766
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,320
I gotta grow it back.

1767
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:10,560
Now- Or you could shave, go all the way.

1768
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,560
Go all the way?

1769
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,560
Yeah.

1770
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,560
I don't think so.

1771
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,560
Oh, man.

1772
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:20,880
You know, I am a geek because I totally love this post.

1773
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:23,720
And this was such a, this was clickbait for Linux users.

1774
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:31,880
If I was a Linux fish, I would be cut, filleted, and served on a Alder wood platter right now

1775
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:38,040
because Tech Mint totally got me with 20 funny commands for Linux.

1776
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,640
Okay, all right.

1777
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,000
Let's do it real fast.

1778
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,600
So first of all, did you know that there's something called, there's a package called

1779
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,600
SL?

1780
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:45,600
Do you know about SL?

1781
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:46,600
Oh, yeah.

1782
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:47,600
You do?

1783
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:48,600
You do know about it?

1784
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:49,600
Steam locomotive.

1785
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,600
Oh, look at you.

1786
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,600
All right.

1787
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,600
So let's, I'm gonna do a packer search for SL right now.

1788
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,800
I absolutely never install it, but I am familiar.

1789
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,200
So oh boy, there's a whole bunch of stuff.

1790
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,280
I don't know, of course, a whole bunch of open SSL stuff came up when I searched for

1791
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,280
that.

1792
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,280
That was a horrible idea.

1793
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,280
What was I thinking?

1794
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:05,680
Of course, this is a total, absolute and complete, look at this list, dude.

1795
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:07,760
This list is 20 pages long.

1796
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,840
I just, okay, you know what I'm gonna do just for sake of content, I'm gonna just install

1797
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,840
SL and see what we get.

1798
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,840
Because why not, right?

1799
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:15,840
Let's just find out.

1800
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:16,840
Well, I've got my container right here.

1801
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:17,840
All right.

1802
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:18,840
So now I'm installed on my machine.

1803
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,840
I'm gonna run SL.

1804
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:20,840
Are you ready?

1805
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,280
So first of all, I want to launch it in a terminal window.

1806
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,280
So I'll hold it.

1807
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,280
Here we go.

1808
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,280
Let's go find out what SL is.

1809
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:26,280
SL.

1810
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:27,280
It's a steam locomotive.

1811
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:28,280
Look at that.

1812
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,280
Isn't that beautiful?

1813
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,280
It actually is really cool.

1814
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:32,400
That is really cool.

1815
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:39,400
So there is this, there is this post over at TechBind about the 20 awesome Linux commands.

1816
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,400
You know what?

1817
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,480
Hold on a second.

1818
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:43,480
Telnet.

1819
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,600
I don't even know if I have Telnet installed.

1820
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,320
Telnet and then blinkinglights.nl.

1821
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,320
Let's see.

1822
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,320
I don't even know.

1823
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,320
Oh, classic.

1824
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,320
Oh, I do have Telnet installed.

1825
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,320
All right.

1826
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,860
So here we go.

1827
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:55,400
So what do I do, Wes?

1828
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,480
Do you know what I do after this point?

1829
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,480
Just watch.

1830
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,480
Just watch.

1831
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,280
Just stand by and watch.

1832
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,440
Okay.

1833
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,440
I'm watching.

1834
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,440
I maximize.

1835
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,440
Maybe I don't need to maximize.

1836
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,440
Hmm.

1837
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:08,160
So this is supposed to be the 20th century.

1838
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,360
Oh yeah, here we go.

1839
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:14,400
Yeah, it's Star Wars.

1840
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,400
It's Star Wars and the Terminal.

1841
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,400
Oh yeah.

1842
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,400
I knew it.

1843
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,400
I knew it.

1844
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,400
I knew it.

1845
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:20,400
Star Wars and the Terminal.

1846
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,400
Oh, what's this one?

1847
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,400
Command toilet.

1848
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,400
I don't think I've heard of that one before.

1849
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,400
No.

1850
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,400
Are you serious?

1851
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:26,400
Number nine.

1852
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,400
Hold on.

1853
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:28,400
Hold on.

1854
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,400
Scroll your ass down there.

1855
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,400
Terminal.

1856
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,400
Okay.

1857
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,400
Toilet.

1858
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,400
Install toilet.

1859
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,400
All right.

1860
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,400
Do you think toilet is a package in art?

1861
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,400
Let's find out.

1862
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,400
It's a package everywhere.

1863
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:38,400
It's been around for years and years and years.

1864
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,960
How come I don't know about it?

1865
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,360
This is what I'm asking myself.

1866
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:42,680
How do you not know all of these?

1867
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,920
I know.

1868
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:49,080
This list is, not only is it horrible, obvious clickbait, but it is totally old command.

1869
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:52,240
Some of them are like, message of the day, like, okay.

1870
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,240
I know about-

1871
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:54,240
Yes.

1872
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,240
Yeah.

1873
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:56,240
All right.

1874
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,240
Okay.

1875
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:58,240
All right.

1876
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,240
I'm installing toilet right now.

1877
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:00,240
All right.

1878
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,240
And I'm going to run toilet.

1879
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,240
I've never had a toilet command.

1880
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,240
Hold on.

1881
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,240
I don't want to run it in Guake.

1882
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,160
I want to give toilet its own dedicated terminal.

1883
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:10,200
So let me open up its own dedicated gnome terminal just for toilet.

1884
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:11,200
Okay.

1885
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,200
All right.

1886
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,200
Here we go.

1887
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,200
Tab completing toilet.

1888
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,460
Are you ready, Wes?

1889
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:18,760
I've never been more ready.

1890
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:19,760
What happens when you run it?

1891
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:21,240
You have to give it some text.

1892
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,240
Okay.

1893
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,240
Oh, okay.

1894
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,240
Off fart.

1895
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,240
Oh.

1896
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:26,240
Okay.

1897
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:27,240
So that's all it does?

1898
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:28,240
Is it just-

1899
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:29,240
Do toilet dash dash gay.

1900
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,240
And then the piece of text.

1901
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,240
It's much nicer.

1902
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:32,240
Dash dash gay?

1903
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,240
Yes.

1904
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:37,200
Dash dash gay and then do I do the text on the same command line or do I wait for-

1905
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,200
Yeah.

1906
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,200
Do toilet dash dash gay space.

1907
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,200
Hello world or something.

1908
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,200
Okay.

1909
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,200
All right.

1910
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,200
Hello.

1911
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,200
Do I need to use quotes?

1912
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,200
No.

1913
01:21:45,200 --> 01:21:46,200
Hello world.

1914
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,200
Okay.

1915
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:48,200
Oh.

1916
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,200
Now that is great.

1917
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,200
Look at it.

1918
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,200
It's a rainbow.

1919
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:56,160
And if you do toilet dash dash gay dash dash IRC hello world, then it gives you all the

1920
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,480
ANSI codes that you could paste into IRC.

1921
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,400
You know, I think I have seen this before now that I see it.

1922
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,880
How did I not know about this?

1923
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,320
This is so wonderful.

1924
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,320
Thank you, Popeye.

1925
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,320
You're welcome.

1926
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:12,160
I like that Popeye is our official expert on the toilet command.

1927
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,160
Thank you, Za.

1928
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:14,160
Of course.

1929
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,160
There's a snap package in the store for toilets.

1930
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:34,160
Oh, beautiful.
