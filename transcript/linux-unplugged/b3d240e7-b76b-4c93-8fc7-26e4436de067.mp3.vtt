00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Wes Payne, ladies and gentlemen, bringing in something that smells rather fierce here, Wes.

00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
What do we have here?

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
It's in a red solo cup, too, so I have legitimately no idea what it is.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
It's like a sneaky beer.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
That's a very interesting taste.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Yeah, what is it? What is it?

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
What do you think it is?

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Well, it's fruity on the nose.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm going to go a little beer is tasty on you here just for a moment, okay?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Yeah, it's definitely fruity on the nose.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
It's got a thin, crisp smell.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
It has a very thin head, just a thick layer of foam on top, but not a lot of head there.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
I'm going to go ahead and go for the mouth test.

00:43.000 --> 00:51.000
The good thing is I don't completely hate it, so that's a good sign.

00:51.000 --> 01:09.000
Wow. Well, it's interesting. It's sort of got a lot going on on the higher notes with kind of a sparkle effect, like a real carbonation, but there's not much in the middle.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
There's not a lot in the middle.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I kind of like that.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, it's definitely very drinkable. You could drink it very fast. It's good. It's refreshing, too.

01:18.000 --> 01:26.000
If it was hot, like right now if we didn't have the AC going, like once we turn off the AC and it starts getting warm in here, I'm going to get warm and this is going to refresh the crap out of me.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
It's got a little bit of the bitterness, but it doesn't sit on your tongue.

01:29.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah, but I feel like it's not hops that I'm getting, but I mean it might be.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
I don't know. Citrusy isn't the right word because it's not citrusy.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Well, kind of. It reminds me of grapefruit somewhat.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
Yeah. Okay, so tell us what's going on here.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
It's real simple. It's just a Sierra Nevada hefeweizen.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
Huh.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Oh, that's where the citrus is coming from.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
There you go.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
That is hilarious.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
None of the six packs looked good, so I just grabbed a 22 and split it between us. That's what happened here.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
So you combined—hold on, just so I understand what you just did here—you combined soda pop and beer?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Right together.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
Where the hell did you get that idea?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
What the hell?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Do you not have Shandy in the U.S.?

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
Oh, no. I guess. I guess. I just—wow, Wes. That's good, though. That's ingenious.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
You know what? I applaud your resourcefulness.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Well, thank you, sir.

02:28.000 --> 02:44.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 212 for August 29, 2017.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux podcast that might be dodging airplanes as we record.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
My name is Chris.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
That's your go. That's your cue.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah, sorry. What am I doing?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Are you installing Gentoo over there or something?

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Maybe, yeah, a little bit. I was hanging the command line challenge.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
And, of course, we're joined by Beardsley. Hello, Beardsley.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Hello.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.000
Hello. You know, guys, it's okay if you want to install Gentoo, but wake up. We have a lot to talk about today.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
We sure do.

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
In fact, we'll get to the Gentoo challenge here in just a moment, but first we're going to do big community updates, really big community updates,

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
and maybe a couple that might make you a little hungry, plus a new segment that might have to become a reoccurring segment, we'll see, called Wimpy Was Right.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
We'll talk about that. It pains me. It pains me.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah, I hope not.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Bitcoin was spent. It pains me.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
And then we're going to do a little follow-up on your feedback about replacing LastPass, a lot of great suggestions.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
Plus, Mr. West there found a great tool that might just do the job for you for your offsite backups.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Then, Purism is getting serious about creating a phone.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
They call it the Librem 5, and as we record right now, their fundraiser is about 10% funded.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
That's actually a substantial amount of money.

03:59.000 --> 04:13.000
And also, as we record right now, coming into the studio is a brand new Librem 15 to replace the one that I crowdfunded years ago now.

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
Right here, we're going to do a live unboxing and look at the new Librem 15 that was just sent to us by Purism right here on the show.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Yeah, we'll just do initial hands-on reactions, and then we'll do a review later on.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
So, we're going to take a look at that.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Plus, we're going to talk about their new fundraiser.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
We're going to talk about all the things I mentioned and community updates.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
But before we go any further, we've got to bring in that virtual lug.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Yes, we do.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Time appropriate. Greetings, Mumble Room.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Hello.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
Guys, I have to start the show with a plea to you.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
I'm going to make you judge and jury here.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
There may be a penance that I have to pay.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
I don't know what it would be, but we'll discuss that.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
We have to punt the Gen 2 Challenge one more week in light of the new Librem 15 hardware.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
It's just what we've got to talk about today.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
It just came in.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I don't know, Chris.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
It sounds to me like you're scared.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
It sounds like you're still compiling.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Oh, did you install KDE?

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Now it makes sense.

05:07.000 --> 05:16.000
I was going to ask for your guidance, Mumble Room, on what we should do in light of yet another punt of the Gen 2 Challenge.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Where do we go from here?

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Because to me, it feels like a fail to deliver.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
But to be honest, we've had some really good reasons.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Yeah, I think so.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm torn up, and I need your guidance.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
Let's just say we're workshopping it.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
It's a special distro.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It needs a special take.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah, yeah.

05:37.000 --> 05:50.000
So here's what I was hoping is maybe if I, in exchange for something, some of you would help us with the Gen 2 Challenge to really keep us to it next week.

05:50.000 --> 06:00.000
If one of you in there were willing to also take the Gen 2 Challenge with us, then we would feel obligated at a friend level to really make sure it gets done.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
I don't know what that pen seems to be to make that happen, but I feel like that's what it would take right now.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Does anybody understand that in the mumble room?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Anyone?

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
I think the penance has to be Linux from scratch challenge after this.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
I mean, producer Michael, you're trying out Linux all the time, and there could be additional content in it.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
Monkey Comm, you've got to be thinking about Gen 2 sometimes.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
Somebody in there, Mr. Arm, you have to be a little curious.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Nobody wants to take the Gen 2 Challenge with us.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Ain't nobody got time for that.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Interesting.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
I did Gen 2 about four or five years ago, and that's all I need to know.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
So screwed.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Maybe Wimpy needs to see what mate is like on Gen 2.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
No, he really doesn't.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
Wow. What does that tell us?

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
I tried it, and my boredom threshold got hit very, very quickly, and I was like, screw this, and just switched off the VM.

06:54.000 --> 07:00.000
I've always been of the opinion that the best place for Gen 2 is in embedded systems.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
I thought you were going to say the kitchen, just for a second.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Sure.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
The best place for Gen 2 is Chrome OS.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
There's plenty of embedded systems in your kitchen.

07:09.000 --> 07:20.000
So the Chrome OS is a great thing to bring up, producer Michael, because it's a reminder that it's legitimately a relevant distro, isn't it?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
For sure.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
And the fact that it's based on Gen 2 makes Gen 2 even more important.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
But I think most people aren't going to be putting much effort into Gen 2.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
I did it once, just to say I did it, and that's enough I care about.

07:34.000 --> 07:43.000
I did it for years in production because it was the only way to get the versions of CUPS and the drivers I needed to get the bank that I wanted to move over to Linux to move.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
That's one of its advantages, right? You have that kind of control.

07:46.000 --> 07:57.000
The unfortunate thing is that Gen 2 is no longer the fastest, and just because it's sourced, people assume that it's going to be the fastest updated. It's not. It's very, very slow in some cases.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
I've had software that just was abandoned years ago, and they don't even care.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
And people who are trying to get maintainership are not given maintainership.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
I just want a hypothetical situation.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
We'll step into the transporter.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
We'll go into the mirror universe where Gen 2 no longer exists.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
Maybe Chrome OS is based off of Linux from scratch or Android or whatever.

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
What changes?

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
I mean, they used to be known for really great documentation, but now that's sort of Arch's mantle.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Right. Yeah, it is.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
So what changed?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
They still have that documentation.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
I think Gen 2's documentation is better than Arch.

08:34.000 --> 08:42.000
I think there's a lot of things on Gen 2 that Arch doesn't address and Gen 2 does.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Hmm. Well, okay.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
So, gosh, I feel like you and I are...

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
Although I did fix one of the things on the Arch Wiki that I found on the Gen 2 Wiki, but whatever.

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
Well, I, in some ways, now am more determined than ever to prove all of you jerks wrong

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
and show you that there's some value still in my old friend Gen 2.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
You know what you should do, Chris?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
What?

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
You should install Gen 2 on that super ancient laptop you did on that last throwback.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
You know where Gen 2 makes a lot of sense to me?

09:15.000 --> 09:20.000
It's like a Raspberry Pi 3 where I do the building off the machine.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Like either using...

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Well, back in the day...

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
The CC?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Yeah. Is that still a thing?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Yeah.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
It is?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I used the shit out of that back in the day because I had a whole server farm.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
And so I would just distribute the builds like crazy and I was like, update, shmupdate.

09:35.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah, I used to run Gen 2 on a Wii way back when, and it worked very nicely.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Had mPlayer going, could stream things to it, it was great.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Well, let's get into community updates.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Maybe we'll have more from Gen 2 land in the near future.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
But this week we're going to talk about the new Librem 15 that came into the studio.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
But first, there's a story that has been going steady since January,

09:57.000 --> 10:03.000
and it's picking up more and more momentum, and I'm kind of wondering what we all make of it.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.000
Mazda and Toyota now are getting together on this Linux infotainment system for cars.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
It's a project that the Linux Foundation has been working on,

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
and they've been, to some success, keeping it in the news every single week,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
and that seems to be paying dividends now.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.000
With Mazda and Toyota joining forces, they're going to be working together

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
on the Linux-based connected car navigation entertainment system.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
Now, the system that Toyota ships and has been shipping I think since 2012 is called Intune.

10:32.000 --> 10:39.000
It's an in-car infotainment platform, and it's got all the crap that is always sort of hacky and not so great.

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
It's got the hands-free phone call support over Bluetooth, music streaming, satnav, as they call it,

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
and it's running on top of Linux.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
This automotive-grade Linux project is taking off more and more, though,

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
with different people getting into Toyota and now Mazda and others that are getting involved.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
The reason why they're working together, even though they're competitors,

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
at least according to a Japanese business newspaper that the Register is citing,

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
they reckon that the joint effort is at least partially due to a shortage of vehicle-focused software development

11:11.000 --> 11:16.000
and developers, especially in the land of the rising sun, as the Register puts it.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.000
So, Intune and, in broader scope, the automotive-grade Linux project,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
I've talked about it a couple of times now on Linux Action News,

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
and I've done some research into the project, and it seems interesting.

11:29.000 --> 11:34.000
If you are someone who likes to have everything built into your headset,

11:34.000 --> 11:41.000
where it does all the nav, it does your music, it runs your apps, it does your streaming, it has Pandora,

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
maybe it has some kind of iHeartRadio and Spotify.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
Right now, currently, because Microsoft's involved, it includes Bing.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Yeah!

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah, and you can get OpenTable for booking restaurant tables and whatnot.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
Those things are all inside the Dash and running on this Linux system.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
That's the approach of automotive-grade Linux versus, say, Android AutoPlay or Apple CarPlay,

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
which is more built around the smarts being in the phone and then the receiver,

12:14.000 --> 12:19.000
the headset being more of like a projection, it's a client of the smarts in the phone.

12:19.000 --> 12:25.000
The automotive-grade Linux project does not support CarPlay or Android AutoPlay or whatever,

12:25.000 --> 12:31.000
Android Auto as it's called, so it's sort of a competitor to those.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
And so, therefore, I'm a little leery on it as somebody who owns a 2012 vehicle

12:36.000 --> 12:44.000
and is ready to replace that really old, prehistoric, awful computer in the dash.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh, man, no kidding, right?

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
I really don't want to replace it with another one that I'm just going to get driven crazy by later on.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
I am more and more thinking about maybe a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen,

12:55.000 --> 13:03.000
maybe even something as crazy as an NVIDIA Shield, or maybe Android Auto or CarPlay.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
All these things, it's not that I'm going to be doing any time soon,

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
but right now what I can't deny is I have an audio aux-in.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
A lot of people use Bluetooth, but I've been using audio aux-in,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
and I just play everything from my phone.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
If I want news, I listen on my phone.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
If I want music, and, of course, podcasts, I do it all on my phone,

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
and the receiver in my truck is just like a dummy unit.

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
It could just be a glorified – it could just be a volume knob and an aux-in jack for all I care these days.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
So I don't need a lot in dash, and automotive-grade Linux is more about you build your entire system

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
on top of this Linux platform where we give you these basic functions and apps and UI elements,

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
and then you deliver an experience for your car on top of it,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
which is what automakers are interested in.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
But as an end user, I'm good just with my aux-in jack and running it off my phone.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
Well, in theory, you could also take the base that you get a car that has support for that.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
Maybe, maybe if they don't have some weird locking system or whatever,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
you could replace it with whatever system you want.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Sure.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
Well, that would be nice.

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
There's also – this is interesting mainly because Mazda and Toyota already have a partnership for other things,

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
and it kind of solidifies it even more that they're partnering.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Good point.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Because they have partnerships with a technology of car development technology,

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
so now that they're doing it with the infotainment part of it, it means that it's likely that –

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
I mean, this particular one, if this was the first time, it would be kind of weird,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
but the fact that they've been doing it for a few years now,

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
it means that this is likely to be a pretty solid partnership.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Sure. That makes sense.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
I agree with you. I'm just going to do this on my phone. I have my phone set up.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
But for people who just use a phone as a phone, if those people still exist,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
is there value in having a better platform in the car?

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
Maybe you're a senior and you want to be able to – you know about some of these things,

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
but you don't want to have to try to figure out how to do that and use the small screen of your car.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Yeah, I think so.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Especially if they can make it better quality connection with your phone calls.

15:09.000 --> 15:16.000
I know a lot of people who are at that age that use the Bluetooth in-car stuff that are just –

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
it's just an awful experience. It's hard to set up. It's like the worst quality audio possible.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
If they can fix that, that would be fantastic.

15:24.000 --> 15:30.000
What about self-driving where there's so much information that all has to be integrated –

15:30.000 --> 15:34.000
speed, traffic, weather conditions, information to the driver?

15:34.000 --> 15:40.000
It seems like having a platform that these car manufacturers – a common technology base

15:40.000 --> 15:46.000
that is sound and proven based on Linux that they can build on top of, they've got to be working this.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
Even if as a consumer, like the reasons I just vocalized, I'd prefer to just do it all from my phone.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
Three generations from now of drivers, though, they're going to have a totally different set of requirements,

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
and they're going to need a really refined system to bring all that information together.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
So I kind of get why they're working on it.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Is it funny that we haven't even talked about that we're –

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
like we're talking about it because it's Linux probably, but we haven't talked at all about it being good for Linux or not?

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
Or is that just – I think that we're just – we assume that this is what Linux does now, right?

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
It's in embedded systems. It's in cars.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
Hmm. Yeah, I guess so, huh?

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
Yeah. I guess maybe because I get a little lost in the – my thoughts are like, what version of Linux is it?

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
That's a good question.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
What kernel is it running?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
There's not a lot of details here even about the product.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
No, if there was, I'd be talking about it.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Yeah, you're right. So I haven't really thought about, like, what does it mean for Linux?

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
I guess I don't think about that much anymore.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
I've mentioned this recently, but we used to be supremely concerned with the Tivoization of Linux.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
That was a supreme concern for us.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
And really sort of the impetus of the GPL3.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah, right. Exactly.

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
Yeah, that was the Tivo issue of, like, trying to lock down Linux or violating it.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
And here we are, and there's a foundation that's – all right, so moving on.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
This is something that I think Popey's really going to have to get in on.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I know he likes cryptocurrencies quite a bit.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Popey, we should really make you our cryptocurrency reporter, to be honest.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Yeah, in the field.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Yeah, in the field, on the lines of the Brexit –

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
In the bits.

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
On the lines of Brexit, where cryptocurrency will become more relevant than ever, is our field reporter, Popey.

17:24.000 --> 17:30.000
And submitted to the desk, Mr. Popey, was this story by BBC.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
And it is Burger King launching a Whopper coin in Russia.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
And the reason why I wanted to put this in here is because, of course, this is going to happen.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
You open source blockchain technology, of course this is going to happen.

17:42.000 --> 17:47.000
This is the natural progression when you open source a fundamental technology like this.

17:47.000 --> 17:55.000
So Russians will be able to buy a Whopper with virtual cash once they have amassed 1,700 Whopper coins.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Whopper coin.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
That's a lot, though.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah, it is, yeah.

17:59.000 --> 18:03.000
And so WAVES is implementing this.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
They're going to use a blockchain ledger to keep track of who's gotten coins,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
although some people say they've been getting screwed already.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
So here you go, ladies and gentlemen.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
This is Burger King helping usher in a cyber dystopia.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
Thank you, Burger King.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
And of course it's Russia.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
It's either Russia or Florida.

18:18.000 --> 18:25.000
How is this any different than the half a dozen store loyalty cards that I already have in my wallet that I get no value out of?

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
I think it's actually better, to tell you the truth.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
You know, I mean, you tell me you're a crypto reporter, Poby,

18:30.000 --> 18:34.000
but to me this actually seems a little more legit because honestly, especially if I could trade,

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
say, you know, you're a big Whopper guy, you want to go get a Whopper in Peru, I could throw you some of my Whopper coins.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Well, not only that, but I'm sure there's going to be a Whopper coin to Bitcoin exchange rate.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Oh, my gosh.

18:46.000 --> 18:53.000
It seems to me you're going to have to eat an awful lot of Whoppers in order for this to be worth anything at all.

18:53.000 --> 19:00.000
Or you've just got to hang around outside and accost everyone who gets their Whopper coins and buy them

19:00.000 --> 19:08.000
when they're clueless people who don't know anything about blockchain stuff, which obviously isn't me.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Well, you can always be right.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Of course, you're a reporter.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.000
But what about, I mean, in your opinion, what about getting into like Whopper coin day trading where you,

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
but depending on you peg it to like, say, the dollar and when the Whopper coin is strong and the dollar is weak,

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
you could trade Whopper coins to other people using their iOS and Android apps.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
I mean, that seems.

19:25.000 --> 19:32.000
Well, I was thinking just amassing a ton of Whopper coins and then you just hoard them and you wait for the Bitcoin price to crash,

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
transfer all the Bitcoins and suddenly you just made a bunch of Bitcoin.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Okay.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
Which I'm still going to spend on hamburgers, but whatever.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
So I guess the only natural conclusion and wimpy, this is just a suggestion.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
I'm just going to I'm an idea guy.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
I'm going to throw it out here for you.

19:45.000 --> 19:51.000
You can choose to run with this, but I think you should seriously consider implementing a Matecoin.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
And then here's the here's the thing.

19:52.000 --> 20:00.000
You what you do is you patch Kaja and people could share their local storage into a pooled encrypted shared cloud storage

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
using BitTorrent to distribute files.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
And the more storage you share and bandwidth you share, the more Matecoin you earn.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
So, you know, you know that that exactly what you've described exists.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Yeah. I'm not that original.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Am I?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
It's very good, actually.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Yeah.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Yeah.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
It's a storage storage share.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Yeah.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
S T O R J.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
And there's a even a command line version, a terminal version, and there's a version.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
That's too funny.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
But you don't get any burgers.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
There's no hamburgers involved with this.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
I'm sure there'll be an exchange, right?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Which is the downside exchange it to Whopper coin.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
That'd be OK.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
Yeah, I think we need to discuss the most important question.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
The Whopper coin be used for chicken fries.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Yeah, yeah.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Especially the Cheeto ones.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Right.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
And you did those suckers.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Or is it just Whoppers?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Because I'd be disappointed.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Right.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Right.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
OK.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I got I have to I have to admit something.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
And this is this this technically qualifies.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
Yeah.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
You know how that makes me feel.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Yeah.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Yeah.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
And the value of this is negative.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
So Wimpy was right.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Wimpy Wimpy was right.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
This never happens.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
VR is dead.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
I'm going to I'm going to extract this clip and get it to my wife tomorrow.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
I'll say it right now.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Nice and clean right up front.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
I hate to admit it, but Wimpy was right.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
VR was hype.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
It's officially dead according to TechCrunch.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
And I think they're right because the metric they're using is is kind of sound.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
It's this year's E3.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
It's the biggest gaming date in the gaming industry.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
It's known under its full titles Electronic Entertainment Expo.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
Huh?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Huh?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Woo.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Uh huh.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.660
And there was an Oculus shaped rift where there should have been a lot of showing off

21:46.660 --> 21:53.520
of new games and HTC is dropping their price as well as Oculus.

21:53.520 --> 21:57.960
And TechCrunch's Lucas Matney says over the past several months it's become clear that

21:57.960 --> 22:03.200
the war is no longer HTC and Oculus trying to discover who is Betamax and VHS.

22:03.200 --> 22:11.080
Now they're trying to ensure that high end VR does not turn out to be laser discs.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.080
My kind of point of view, Chris?

22:12.080 --> 22:13.080
That hurts.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.080
It does.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.000
Star Trek bridge crew.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Haven't tried it.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.540
You know, I'm thinking about I'm thinking about why I have a Windows 10 machine trying

22:19.540 --> 22:23.360
it because I have one for like I think I feel like this week I'm going to have a Windows

22:23.360 --> 22:25.480
10 machine and that's about as long as I'm going to make it.

22:25.480 --> 22:32.040
I should give it a go because VR can't possibly be dead if you can play Star Trek on it.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.040
I know.

22:33.040 --> 22:36.200
I mean, I have seen it at like some bars and other type venues that have these sorts of

22:36.200 --> 22:41.680
like and there's at least one in Seattle that has like you can go there and play VR including

22:41.680 --> 22:42.680
Star Trek.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.960
So I think you can have like a party where you rent multiple of their rooms and then

22:44.960 --> 22:46.600
you're all playing Star Trek together.

22:46.600 --> 22:47.600
No kidding.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.600
Yeah.

22:48.600 --> 22:49.600
So that sounds fun.

22:49.600 --> 22:53.200
But it doesn't make it necessarily the same sort of cost benefit for an individual consumer.

22:53.200 --> 22:59.160
I also think that they're they're not counting the fact that PlayStation just added VR to

22:59.160 --> 23:00.640
their system.

23:00.640 --> 23:05.360
Like that's a relatively large user base that they're going to be targeting.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.920
Well, they added that in December last year, didn't they?

23:08.920 --> 23:12.120
And the sales were well, well lower than they were anticipating.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.120
Well, yeah.

23:13.120 --> 23:17.640
But I didn't I didn't know that this was the topic that was going to come up.

23:17.640 --> 23:24.240
But what's interesting is I happened to be thinking about the whole VR thing because,

23:24.240 --> 23:27.960
you know, predictions for this year, you know, December's coming and I was reflecting on

23:27.960 --> 23:34.840
my predictions this year, which have the usual VR is rubbish in it.

23:34.840 --> 23:39.720
And I went back and I listened to what episode number is this of Linux Unplugged?

23:39.720 --> 23:40.720
212.

23:40.720 --> 23:48.720
OK, so I listened back to episode 82 of Linux Unplugged, where Poppy and I have a rather

23:48.720 --> 23:55.920
heated exchange about the relevancy of VR and everything that was discussed back in

23:55.920 --> 24:01.240
episode 82 is the same today.

24:01.240 --> 24:05.000
I had a good experience and I just wanted other people to I just wanted I feel like

24:05.000 --> 24:08.160
the problem was it was the hardware and it was the expense.

24:08.160 --> 24:10.320
Were you going to say something, Poppy?

24:10.320 --> 24:14.920
I was just trying to remember that that conversation, I tried to block out of my mind because Martin

24:14.920 --> 24:15.920
was right.

24:15.920 --> 24:16.920
And you're focused on cryptocurrencies.

24:16.920 --> 24:17.920
Oh, my goodness.

24:17.920 --> 24:18.920
I'm so having that as my ringtone.

24:18.920 --> 24:23.280
I do hope everyone else was talking over me.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.280
So Martin can't grab.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.280
Yeah, no.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.280
Martin was right.

24:26.280 --> 24:27.280
Right.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.280
Talk over, talk over.

24:28.280 --> 24:33.280
So did we talk about only VR or did we talk about AR as well?

24:33.280 --> 24:35.720
I think back then we were only talking about VR.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.720
I think we touched on AR at the very end.

24:37.720 --> 24:41.840
But I think I suggested that that might be the only thing that would be useful.

24:41.840 --> 24:46.200
You might be right on that because Google have announced AR Core for Android.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.760
Yeah, that's the thing today.

24:47.760 --> 24:53.240
So AR Core, which is like AR Kit, can even kind of sounds a bit alike.

24:53.240 --> 24:59.800
And the reason why these are pretty substantial is you can write once and run on both because

24:59.800 --> 25:05.440
you're talking about Unity and Unreal 4 here and then the tools in between will make it

25:05.440 --> 25:08.720
run on AR Kit or, in theory now, AR Core.

25:08.720 --> 25:15.040
And I've been seeing, if you step outside the Linux bubble, I got to say there have

25:15.040 --> 25:18.640
been some significantly impressive AR demos.

25:18.640 --> 25:24.400
I'm sure we've all seen them on Twitter and stuff of the iPhone with iOS 11.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.920
There is some really interesting stuff happening there.

25:27.920 --> 25:31.960
And it does make sense to do it at the phone level because you've got all those sensors

25:31.960 --> 25:37.320
for where you're at in space, the angle of the device, the cameras.

25:37.320 --> 25:42.360
Which has already had a ton of development effort poured into them over the years.

25:42.360 --> 25:48.120
And then a really solid way to deliver new versions of the apps which need cutting edge

25:48.120 --> 25:49.900
development to stay competitive.

25:49.900 --> 25:51.460
It just makes sense to do it there.

25:51.460 --> 25:56.680
But I mourn for the loss of high-end VR on the PC because it's so much better than anything

25:56.680 --> 25:59.320
you could do with cardboard or even AR.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.800
Yeah, see, I don't think VR is dead.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.400
I think just the VR hype is dying.

26:04.400 --> 26:10.640
I think VR is continuing to progress and starting to come more in line with consumer expectations

26:10.640 --> 26:12.120
in terms of price.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.240
That's why the price drops are coming, not because-

26:14.240 --> 26:16.480
I don't think that this is an issue about price.

26:16.480 --> 26:21.760
I think the issue is you have to wear equipment which tethers you to a computer.

26:21.760 --> 26:26.120
And the solution to that apparently is to buy a backpack that you put your computer

26:26.120 --> 26:30.920
in so you can now walk around tethered to this computer that you carry.

26:30.920 --> 26:36.880
And then all of these sensors that you have to rig up in a room to know where you are.

26:36.880 --> 26:37.880
Ultimately you're blindfolded.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.900
You can't actually see what you're doing.

26:39.900 --> 26:42.440
So you're just an accident waiting to happen.

26:42.440 --> 26:44.820
And then there's the expense on top.

26:44.820 --> 26:51.400
So there's a lot of reasons why VR has just got a load of reasons why mass consumer adoption

26:51.400 --> 26:52.400
is a long way away.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.840
Are you saying that VR's problem is the PC?

26:55.840 --> 26:59.240
Yes, to some extent.

26:59.240 --> 27:03.840
Geez, that makes me sad.

27:03.840 --> 27:07.800
But the fact that you're blindfolded, you get these baby walkers that you can stand

27:07.800 --> 27:11.920
in so you can now run around and walk around because you're sort of harnessed inside this

27:11.920 --> 27:12.920
safe space.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.240
The 360 degree-

27:14.240 --> 27:20.080
It's just the solutions that are being created for this are just mental.

27:20.080 --> 27:25.780
I've always thought the escapist aspect of it would be too overwhelming, too appealing

27:25.780 --> 27:30.080
to deny, and that it would take off just because it would be like another drug.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.280
It would be like another way to escape reality.

27:32.280 --> 27:37.240
Yeah, I mean to me, that's not why it has problems.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.880
That's why I want it.

27:38.880 --> 27:44.480
It's putting me in a completely different reality.

27:44.480 --> 27:47.480
It sounds fun, especially with those 360 degree treadmill stuff.

27:47.480 --> 27:52.000
That's why I can see it in bigger places or community events or bars or venues and maybe

27:52.000 --> 27:54.600
not in my home anytime soon.

27:54.600 --> 27:59.360
Yeah, meanwhile though, AR is obviously going to get a lot of attention over the next year.

27:59.360 --> 28:00.360
Especially in the industrial space.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.820
Yeah, but it's the same thing about AR.

28:02.820 --> 28:08.200
People have been saying AR is more interesting than VR, and it's basically gone nowhere.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.920
The same amount of stuff.

28:10.920 --> 28:14.400
I would be willing to bet you at dinner, the next time you're out in this neck of the woods

28:14.400 --> 28:19.000
for an event, I'll bet you at dinner that by this time next year, we're talking a lot

28:19.000 --> 28:22.600
more about AR just because of ARCore and ARKit.

28:22.600 --> 28:28.320
Because ARKit is going to ship on every Apple device that supports iOS 11, which is going

28:28.320 --> 28:31.880
to be 80% of the iPhones in the marketplace.

28:31.880 --> 28:34.120
They're all going to have this AR capability.

28:34.120 --> 28:37.920
And you know the new feature on the iPhone 8 is going to be dual cameras that have depth

28:37.920 --> 28:40.640
sensing sensors that are going to support ARKit.

28:40.640 --> 28:45.680
Yeah, but I don't want to experience augmented reality through my little phone screen.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.680
No, no.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.680
But maybe this is the trajectory.

28:48.680 --> 28:53.760
Maybe you have to start here to get buy-off on this concept.

28:53.760 --> 28:54.760
I don't know.

28:54.760 --> 28:55.760
But do you want to-

28:55.760 --> 28:56.760
Go ahead.

28:56.760 --> 29:00.080
Do you want to experience virtual reality sat down because it's the only safe way to

29:00.080 --> 29:01.920
experience this reality?

29:01.920 --> 29:02.920
Yeah.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.800
No, because that's the 360-

29:04.800 --> 29:05.800
I'm kind of lazy though.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.880
I mean, if I'm going to be in there for hours, I kind of want to sit down.

29:08.880 --> 29:09.880
Wow.

29:09.880 --> 29:10.880
That's true.

29:10.880 --> 29:15.920
See, to me, the only compelling augmented reality thing, and I know I'm on Linux Unplugged,

29:15.920 --> 29:20.440
it's the HoloLens.

29:20.440 --> 29:23.400
If you're going to do AR, that is how you do it.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.400
Yeah.

29:24.400 --> 29:28.040
And then on VR, we've still just got a bunch of tech demos.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.760
There is no compelling titles.

29:29.760 --> 29:30.760
If there was-

29:30.760 --> 29:31.760
Oh, I disagree with you on that.

29:31.760 --> 29:32.760
If there was-

29:32.760 --> 29:33.760
You know what?

29:33.760 --> 29:34.760
I have more faith-

29:34.760 --> 29:35.760
Rest of the sun's on VR.

29:35.760 --> 29:39.820
I have more faith in ARCore that was announced today by Google than I do in HoloLens just

29:39.820 --> 29:42.640
because Microsoft can't ship anything other than Azure.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.280
That's the only thing they ship these days.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.960
We had this conversation-

29:45.960 --> 29:46.960
We should-

29:46.960 --> 29:47.960
Yeah, okay.

29:47.960 --> 29:48.960
All right.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.320
I have one thing I want to punt to you guys.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.960
Minimac had an opinion about this in the pre-show.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.040
I wanted to bring it up here.

29:56.040 --> 30:02.120
Joe and I, Joe Resington and I, talked about Sailfish charging for their new ROM.

30:02.120 --> 30:07.880
They're customizing for the Sony Xperia X. 50 pounds, I think it was, or I can't remember.

30:07.880 --> 30:08.880
Actually, where's the price at?

30:08.880 --> 30:09.880
50 euros.

30:09.880 --> 30:10.880
50 euros.

30:10.880 --> 30:11.880
I can't tell them apart.

30:11.880 --> 30:12.880
I'm kidding.

30:12.880 --> 30:13.880
What was the price?

30:13.880 --> 30:14.880
What was the price?

30:14.880 --> 30:20.000
I actually, in Linux Action News, I thought, shit, they should charge 100 because what

30:20.000 --> 30:27.160
they're eventually promising is grade A support for the Sony Xperia X running Sailfish.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.160
They're not there yet.

30:28.160 --> 30:33.120
There's some of the sensors that don't work, Bluetooth doesn't work, but the idea is ongoing

30:33.120 --> 30:38.920
support for this device, and they've included licensing for things like Exchange.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.840
Minimac, you want to do a couple of follow-up points from Linux Action News.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.360
2016, I think it was, if I'm recalling correctly.

30:45.360 --> 30:48.720
Why don't you take some of the highlights there, and then maybe we'll kick it around

30:48.720 --> 30:50.720
and see what other people had to add.

30:50.720 --> 30:51.720
Yeah, thanks.

30:51.720 --> 30:55.760
As mentioned before, I'm by no means a Sailfish developer.

30:55.760 --> 30:59.960
I'm maybe a script kiddie for the Nexus 5 port, nothing more.

30:59.960 --> 31:05.280
As you said in the show, the Xperia X is considered to be a first-class device for Sailfish OS.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.480
That includes the license parts.

31:07.480 --> 31:13.640
That means Android support, T9 root prediction, and Microsoft Exchange support.

31:13.640 --> 31:19.400
One part of these 50 bucks is simply license fees, but there is a cool thing about it.

31:19.400 --> 31:25.720
Jolla will publish the source code of the hardware adaptation layer called libhybris

31:25.720 --> 31:28.600
for the device in the coming week or weeks.

31:28.600 --> 31:34.220
There will be a free community port for the Sony Xperia X, and that is the cool thing

31:34.220 --> 31:40.560
about it, because this is a milestone, the Xperia X is the first ARM 64-bit port of Sailfish

31:40.560 --> 31:48.840
OS, and that might be the start of other Sony and other devices running 64-bit chipsets.

31:48.840 --> 31:52.160
So they're doing the legwork to get this working on ARM 64.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.400
Well, okay.

31:53.400 --> 31:57.840
So what about Jolla's point then that, well, if there's a community version available,

31:57.840 --> 32:00.600
where do they get off charging 50 bucks for it?

32:00.600 --> 32:02.200
What's the incentive to pay for that?

32:02.200 --> 32:05.320
I think that's what Jo's concern was, why would I pay 50 bucks for something I can get

32:05.320 --> 32:06.320
for free?

32:06.320 --> 32:14.440
I guess the idea is that you have software for Windows 10 and even Mac OS and Linux where

32:14.440 --> 32:22.920
you can click install the ROM on your existing Sony Xperia X device in the future, but for

32:22.920 --> 32:30.000
now you need a Linux computer, because right now you have to use a console for it.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.900
Producer Michael, what are your thoughts about charging something like this for a ROM?

32:32.900 --> 32:36.720
And let's just for sake of conversation say it was like lineage even, so something that's

32:36.720 --> 32:43.840
super available, but it's just been totally designed for insert Android handset here,

32:43.840 --> 32:47.760
and it's like perfectly designed for that, perfectly tuned.

32:47.760 --> 32:52.160
I would say that it would be, the business model itself is not necessarily a bad thing.

32:52.160 --> 32:56.160
If they were to say make a freemium version where you could get extra features for paying

32:56.160 --> 33:01.000
for it, that'd be cool, but as long as it's not limiting the phone in any way, but it's

33:01.000 --> 33:05.280
just like an extra thing, or it's more like if you want to support us, here's a way to

33:05.280 --> 33:07.720
do that and buy this particular thing.

33:07.720 --> 33:08.720
That kind of thing is fine.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.200
I don't even care if they only did a premium and that's it.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.680
I just don't like who it's coming from.

33:14.680 --> 33:18.000
Tell me about that.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.600
Well, I mean, I don't trust Yola.

33:23.600 --> 33:28.160
You can't trust Yola, in my opinion, mainly because how much of this $50 is going back

33:28.160 --> 33:30.120
to the money that they owe people for the tablet?

33:30.120 --> 33:33.760
Well, I mean, yeah, okay, maybe.

33:33.760 --> 33:39.500
If they still owe people like $100, $150 depending on what level they were in, why would anyone

33:39.500 --> 33:43.800
trust them to buy a software that doesn't even work right now?

33:43.800 --> 33:51.280
Yeah, you can put it on your system and also there's fundamental pieces that do not work.

33:51.280 --> 33:56.840
I'm surprised to hear that because you in the United States have this thing that a company

33:56.840 --> 34:03.040
can fail and Yola failed with the Yola tablet and I was one of the backer, but still they

34:03.040 --> 34:08.400
live on and they try to continue and they try to do something which is really good for

34:08.400 --> 34:09.520
the community.

34:09.520 --> 34:11.800
So I can't agree with you really.

34:11.800 --> 34:14.160
And most of the selfish always is open source.

34:14.160 --> 34:18.520
When they pay money back to the people that they didn't get the money to, that would be

34:18.520 --> 34:19.520
fine.

34:19.520 --> 34:22.360
They are trying to, they are trying to.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.120
Okay, good.

34:24.120 --> 34:31.000
If they say how much money of this $50 per unit per purchase goes to that, that'd be

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
great.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.360
But until they do that, we don't have any information except trust us.

34:35.360 --> 34:43.740
No, they have a program which says when the Yola is making a profit, they will take a

34:43.740 --> 34:46.700
part of this profit and pay back the backers.

34:46.700 --> 34:51.560
So that was announced at the beginning of the year.

34:51.560 --> 34:53.760
I don't really have an issue with the price either.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.400
The price seems really reasonable.

34:55.400 --> 34:58.520
So it seems like if this is how they're going to pay that back, yeah, it's going to take

34:58.520 --> 34:59.520
them a while to do it.

34:59.520 --> 35:03.000
If this is how they're going to, I bet a big part of how they're paying that back is coming

35:03.000 --> 35:08.040
from the more business deals that they're, that was what I got when I did some digging

35:08.040 --> 35:12.800
for Linux action news is they've lined up a couple of customization jobs for businesses

35:12.800 --> 35:15.480
and that's going to pay some of that back.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.960
But you're right, you don't really know.

35:17.960 --> 35:18.960
You don't know.

35:18.960 --> 35:24.040
If the software was ready to go when they announced this and it wasn't like, Hey, here's

35:24.040 --> 35:25.440
these things that don't work.

35:25.440 --> 35:29.960
And one of them happens to be very important to a lot of people, Bluetooth, like that,

35:29.960 --> 35:32.840
that you, you need to fix that before you ship it.

35:32.840 --> 35:38.100
And like if I would be interested because if they had, if this, if this ROM was fully

35:38.100 --> 35:42.760
functional right out of the box and I don't have to wait for, for like some absurd, you

35:42.760 --> 35:48.040
know, early adopter thing, if it's an early adopter, I'm just picking it up and then just

35:48.040 --> 35:49.040
flashing it myself.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.040
That's fine.

35:50.040 --> 35:53.040
But if I have to flash it myself and have to pay for it, then I expect it to work because

35:53.040 --> 35:54.520
it's a, it's a premium product.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.520
Yeah.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.520
Yeah.

35:56.520 --> 36:00.960
But the Xperia, the Xperia X is a pretty reasonable price phone, $50 extra on top of that, still

36:00.960 --> 36:03.720
way under the majority flagship phones.

36:03.720 --> 36:06.680
So I would be interested as long as the ROM worked.

36:06.680 --> 36:09.560
I have, I have good memories of Sailfish OS too.

36:09.560 --> 36:10.560
All right.

36:10.560 --> 36:14.160
Well, we should move on because we have, wrap it up, go ahead.

36:14.160 --> 36:18.240
For Bluetooth, I think there are two problems with Bluetooth right now.

36:18.240 --> 36:21.840
So first there have been big changes to the operating system.

36:21.840 --> 36:28.960
They introduced Blues 5 for devices that have run kernels that run the Blues 5 API.

36:28.960 --> 36:33.520
And the other problem might be the Qualcomm chipset, which is certified for Bluetooth

36:33.520 --> 36:34.880
4.2.

36:34.880 --> 36:39.960
So I guess they're just filling out these problems and maybe even the community can

36:39.960 --> 36:41.920
help them to fill out these problems.

36:41.920 --> 36:44.960
Well, Manny Mac, thank you for keeping us posted on that.

36:44.960 --> 36:47.900
That is, that is good perspective and I appreciate it.

36:47.900 --> 36:53.340
And if you want to know what sort of inspired this entire conversation, check out linuxactionnews.com.

36:53.340 --> 36:56.000
We've got the latest stuff from there.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.520
And if you think of anything else, let's, let's include it in the post show.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.680
I think we should probably keep going.

37:02.680 --> 37:03.680
There's like,

37:03.680 --> 37:05.980
There's more to talk about today.

37:05.980 --> 37:07.120
You made us an amazing show.

37:07.120 --> 37:10.800
I mean, like, like, like we have so much more to get to, including, I want to, I really

37:10.800 --> 37:13.160
want to unbox this, this Librem and check it out.

37:13.160 --> 37:15.980
I have, I have really no idea what to expect.

37:15.980 --> 37:19.000
So let's, let's talk about how we made this show possible.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.480
It's our first sponsor this week and that's Linux Academy.

37:21.480 --> 37:24.240
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

37:24.240 --> 37:27.960
That's where you can sign up for a free seven day trial and support the show.

37:27.960 --> 37:32.120
Linux Academy is a platform to learn more about Linux created by Linux enthusiasts.

37:32.120 --> 37:36.440
From the basics all the way up to the big platforms that make the big bucks these days.

37:36.440 --> 37:40.660
Linux Academy is really something special with human mentoring available, instructors

37:40.660 --> 37:44.400
when you need it, and a community stack full of Jupiter broadcasting members.

37:44.400 --> 37:49.280
Whether you're an experienced sys admin or new to the world of Linux, Azure and AWS,

37:49.280 --> 37:54.600
OpenStack and DevOps, a sharp skill set is an absolute necessity to succeed.

37:54.600 --> 38:00.600
Meet Linux Academy, an online Linux and cloud training platform that uses self-paced video

38:00.600 --> 38:06.720
courses and hands-on labs to give you real-world experience for a wide range of skills.

38:06.720 --> 38:11.300
Train for your certification, learn the latest DevOps tools, and grow your skill set to do

38:11.300 --> 38:12.400
better work.

38:12.400 --> 38:15.280
Linux Academy is not just a video library.

38:15.280 --> 38:20.160
Our scenario-based server labs and quiz system allow you to learn hands-on.

38:20.160 --> 38:25.600
We also have full-time human instructors who answer questions and help you earn that certification

38:25.600 --> 38:27.240
or promotion at work.

38:27.240 --> 38:31.840
We add new training every week so you'll always be up to date on the latest tech.

38:31.840 --> 38:36.940
Sys admins of every experience level use Linux Academy to stay on the bleeding edge of the

38:36.940 --> 38:38.520
Linux ecosystem.

38:38.520 --> 38:40.520
You should too.

38:40.520 --> 38:45.740
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged, free seven-day trial, it is really a secret weapon.

38:45.740 --> 38:48.680
I can only imagine if I could go back in time.

38:48.680 --> 38:53.280
It'd be like if I was, if I was, uh, uh, Bic, or what's his name?

38:53.280 --> 38:54.280
What's the guy's name?

38:54.280 --> 38:55.280
Bic?

38:55.280 --> 38:56.280
Bic Tannen?

38:56.280 --> 38:57.280
Yeah, I think it's Bic.

38:57.280 --> 38:58.280
Is it Bic?

38:58.280 --> 38:59.280
Why does it sound right?

38:59.280 --> 39:00.280
Is it Bif?

39:00.280 --> 39:01.280
Bif.

39:01.280 --> 39:02.280
Bif.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.280
Yeah, Bif.

39:03.280 --> 39:04.280
Bif.

39:04.280 --> 39:06.040
Yeah, if I was Bif Tannen, if I was Bif Tannen and I had the sports almanac, only this would

39:06.040 --> 39:07.040
be Linux Academy.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.040
It would be a Linux Academy.

39:08.040 --> 39:11.720
And I go back in time with Linux Academy and I'd know all the answers.

39:11.720 --> 39:13.720
But now, of course, all them young whippersnappers.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.480
You'd be like, hey, I'm really good with system D.

39:15.480 --> 39:18.200
All them people looking for germs, all those people looking to get ahead, now they got

39:18.200 --> 39:19.200
Linux Academy.

39:19.200 --> 39:20.200
You know what would be even better, Chris?

39:20.200 --> 39:21.200
What?

39:21.200 --> 39:22.200
Is if you went back and you started Linux Academy.

39:22.200 --> 39:24.480
Oh, I should have.

39:24.480 --> 39:27.040
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

39:27.040 --> 39:28.040
Thanks to them.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.920
And sign up for a free seven-day trial.

39:29.920 --> 39:33.200
All right, let's talk about a couple of quick things in Mumble Room.

39:33.200 --> 39:38.960
Feel free to jump the F in if you got something even better that kind of conclude our conversation

39:38.960 --> 39:40.960
about replacing LastPass.

39:40.960 --> 39:45.440
Do you have any thoughts on remote backup, Wes, before we go any further?

39:45.440 --> 39:50.560
Remote backup in general, because last week we had to talk about CrashPlan was dropping

39:50.560 --> 39:52.600
their personal plan.

39:52.600 --> 39:56.080
And that's sort of like that really good deal that lets you just send a ton of data up there.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.660
And you got to get the F off the service.

39:57.660 --> 39:59.040
We talked about different options.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.200
Do you have any immediate thoughts?

40:00.200 --> 40:02.960
Do you want to chime in anything on offsite backup on anything like that?

40:02.960 --> 40:06.480
I mean, I think you guys did a pretty good job of rounding it up.

40:06.480 --> 40:09.360
I use Tarsnap myself for some things.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.440
And then I also have a couple of friends.

40:11.440 --> 40:16.000
And we do have some, you know, set up some boxes that we can do R6 from, which works

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
pretty nicely.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Yeah.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
Okay.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.000
What about you, Beardsley?

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
There is one service that we didn't mention that I'm surprised we didn't mention.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.120
At least I don't think we did.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.120
And that's Backblaze.

40:24.120 --> 40:29.280
Well, we mentioned in the context of B2 or whatever, because of their Linux support.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.280
Yeah.

40:30.280 --> 40:31.280
Yeah.

40:31.280 --> 40:35.960
WSHacks wrote in on the subreddit and said, I'm surprised SpiderOak didn't come up, which

40:35.960 --> 40:36.960
is my bad.

40:36.960 --> 40:37.960
I'm a SpiderOak subscriber.

40:37.960 --> 40:43.320
He says, it's one of the few consumer-focused backup services that I know of that has a

40:43.320 --> 40:47.400
Linux client besides Tarsnap and Rclone.

40:47.400 --> 40:50.560
The other options I looked at are rsync.net.

40:50.560 --> 40:52.440
So that was what he had to add.

40:52.440 --> 40:56.340
I know rsync.net now does, you can do like zfs send to them.

40:56.340 --> 40:57.340
So that's pretty sweet.

40:57.340 --> 40:58.340
That is.

40:58.340 --> 40:59.340
If you have a big zfs array.

40:59.340 --> 41:00.340
That is really sweet.

41:00.340 --> 41:01.840
Alan Jude should get into something like that.

41:01.840 --> 41:02.840
Yeah, right?

41:02.840 --> 41:03.840
That would be right in his wheelhouse.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.520
Yeah, I'd send some bits over to Alan.

41:06.520 --> 41:07.520
Yeah.

41:07.520 --> 41:08.520
I just looked up Backblaze.

41:08.520 --> 41:10.540
It is super damn cheap for B2.

41:10.540 --> 41:13.320
It's half a cent per gigabyte per month.

41:13.320 --> 41:14.320
Woo.

41:14.320 --> 41:15.320
Woo.

41:15.320 --> 41:17.400
So that's really, really.

41:17.400 --> 41:18.400
But B2.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.400
You're looking at B2?

41:19.400 --> 41:20.400
Yeah, yeah.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.520
So Rclone and whatnot does support B2.

41:22.520 --> 41:27.400
Well, not only that, but they now have their own command line Linux client as well.

41:27.400 --> 41:28.400
Is that right?

41:28.400 --> 41:29.400
Yeah.

41:29.400 --> 41:30.400
All right.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.920
Now, Mr. Wimpy, you were going to make a mention about Enpass.

41:32.920 --> 41:39.720
Yes, this isn't a backup utility, but an alternative to LastPass for storing your passwords.

41:39.720 --> 41:41.720
Which you probably need to back up.

41:41.720 --> 41:42.720
Yeah.

41:42.720 --> 41:48.240
And the way that Enpass works is unlike LastPass, they don't provide the cloud storage backend.

41:48.240 --> 41:52.480
It's client software that runs on all the different platforms.

41:52.480 --> 42:00.000
And then you then sync your wallet with whatever backend file syncing service you choose to

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
use.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Do you want to-

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Yeah.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.180
And the price is very, it's free unless you want to do mobile stuff.

42:07.180 --> 42:10.280
And then it's only like 10 bucks per device.

42:10.280 --> 42:14.120
So Wimpy, do you feel like divulging what you've chosen to sync it with?

42:14.120 --> 42:20.440
Well, I have it synced in Dropbox at the moment because it's all locally encrypted.

42:20.440 --> 42:24.120
So there's nothing going into Dropbox that I need to worry about.

42:24.120 --> 42:25.960
I was hoping you'd say because you hate freedom.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.680
I knew there was a low chance, but I just thought that'd be really funny.

42:28.680 --> 42:29.680
Yeah.

42:29.680 --> 42:31.240
That's what I'm using too, myself.

42:31.240 --> 42:32.240
Yeah.

42:32.240 --> 42:34.080
Dropbox is still being used for a lot of stuff.

42:34.080 --> 42:37.400
And for offsite backups, I'm using Rclone and S3.

42:37.400 --> 42:38.400
Ah.

42:38.400 --> 42:39.400
I am.

42:39.400 --> 42:40.400
Oh, and how are you liking that?

42:40.400 --> 42:41.400
Yeah, very good.

42:41.400 --> 42:51.080
I've also got Amazon photo storage and Amazon file storage through Amazon Prime.

42:51.080 --> 42:56.400
And what I like about that is you can actually instigate cloud to cloud transfers.

42:56.400 --> 43:01.520
You don't have to Rclone all of your stuff down locally and then push it somewhere.

43:01.520 --> 43:07.720
You can actually clone it between cloud storage backends without having to pull it down.

43:07.720 --> 43:08.720
Wow.

43:08.720 --> 43:09.720
That is nice.

43:09.720 --> 43:10.720
Yeah.

43:10.720 --> 43:11.840
And I know you weren't here last week either.

43:11.840 --> 43:15.880
Do you have any thoughts on offsite backup or want to share anything you've tried and

43:15.880 --> 43:17.360
had success with?

43:17.360 --> 43:21.280
So yeah, I don't do any offsite backup.

43:21.280 --> 43:23.440
I do it all to a home server.

43:23.440 --> 43:27.840
So yeah, if my house went up in flames, I'd lose everything.

43:27.840 --> 43:28.840
That's bad.

43:28.840 --> 43:31.640
And I keep not quite getting around to anything.

43:31.640 --> 43:33.320
And I've tried most of these.

43:33.320 --> 43:34.320
I've tried...

43:34.320 --> 43:38.240
What was the one you mentioned, Spider Oak?

43:38.240 --> 43:39.240
Yeah.

43:39.240 --> 43:40.920
It's an atrocious user interface.

43:40.920 --> 43:41.920
Yeah.

43:41.920 --> 43:42.920
Slow too.

43:42.920 --> 43:43.920
Yeah.

43:43.920 --> 43:44.920
Yeah.

43:44.920 --> 43:49.240
But I'm keen to know what other people use that are good and reliable and I can just

43:49.240 --> 43:53.200
fire and forget and not have to faff about and worry about it with large volumes of data

43:53.200 --> 44:00.040
because I have a huge multi-terabyte array with all my backups on at home and I don't

44:00.040 --> 44:02.680
know what to do with it.

44:02.680 --> 44:03.680
So...

44:03.680 --> 44:04.680
Hi ho.

44:04.680 --> 44:05.680
What was that?

44:05.680 --> 44:06.680
Hi, Chris.

44:06.680 --> 44:07.680
It's Ben.

44:07.680 --> 44:08.680
How are you doing?

44:08.680 --> 44:09.680
Nice to see you, Ben.

44:09.680 --> 44:13.760
Well, I just wanted to talk about this part of the show.

44:13.760 --> 44:16.000
Well, I've always used...

44:16.000 --> 44:21.280
I've used R Sync a couple of times and I've also used Google Drive and...

44:21.280 --> 44:22.280
What else?

44:22.280 --> 44:26.160
OneDrive and a couple of other different solutions.

44:26.160 --> 44:29.440
And also, can I jump back to the Gen 2 part for just a minute?

44:29.440 --> 44:33.000
I just wanted to say that I'm willing to help you on that front.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
That's what I wanted to point out.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
Oh, you're gonna take the challenge with us?

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
Welcome aboard.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Yeah.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
Welcome aboard.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.400
Well, I want to help you guys out at any point.

44:40.400 --> 44:43.360
If you get stuck in the installation or anything like that, I'm willing to help.

44:43.360 --> 44:44.760
Oh, I'm not so worried about that.

44:44.760 --> 44:46.560
I mean, I feel like I can do that.

44:46.560 --> 44:49.500
I feel like I'm more like I just want somebody to do it with us.

44:49.500 --> 44:50.500
It's like, you know, when you're trying to...

44:50.500 --> 44:53.680
Yeah, I'm willing to jump on board, that's fine, because I've installed it half a dozen

44:53.680 --> 44:54.680
times.

44:54.680 --> 44:58.440
I mean, Spatry even said I've installed it more times than people change things.

44:58.440 --> 45:00.240
Well, okay.

45:00.240 --> 45:05.040
So to our topic at hand here, so you're using R Sync to offsite what?

45:05.040 --> 45:06.040
Like you're going...

45:06.040 --> 45:07.040
Are you going to...

45:07.040 --> 45:10.120
I mean, I've done a bunch of different Linux respins and different things like that and

45:10.120 --> 45:11.120
different ISOs.

45:11.120 --> 45:17.080
And I've helped out a couple of different people with their Linux respins and I've uploaded

45:17.080 --> 45:20.080
stuff for them on R Sync and different stuff like that.

45:20.080 --> 45:24.640
So yeah, I've uploaded several different files and stuff like that that I've had to back

45:24.640 --> 45:32.280
up the different cloud sourcing like SourceForge, GitHub, different stuff like that with R Sync.

45:32.280 --> 45:36.880
Surf Rock wrote into the show and he says, in regards to CrashPlan, eliminating home

45:36.880 --> 45:41.240
accounts, he says, here's what led me to convert to a CrashPlan Pro account.

45:41.240 --> 45:43.400
He did some soul searching, he did the math.

45:43.400 --> 45:47.720
He looked at the fact that he's got a NAS server with 12 terabytes on it.

45:47.720 --> 45:51.680
He's got some Dropbox systems that he wants to send offsite.

45:51.680 --> 45:53.360
He's got a couple of machines he wants to back up.

45:53.360 --> 45:59.960
He said, now I could do a single backup of my entire home to the local server, all over

45:59.960 --> 46:03.080
like some sort of NFS or Samba mount.

46:03.080 --> 46:07.720
And then still, trying to do all the math, he says, the best thing for me is to just

46:07.720 --> 46:10.460
go for CrashPlan Pro.

46:10.460 --> 46:17.780
It's 120 US greenbacks a year, but the backups not only capture all of your data, they also

46:17.780 --> 46:22.000
capture all of the configs for all of the machines.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.320
Which to him was sort of like the, ah, that's the sensor for me.

46:25.320 --> 46:30.060
I want a utility that'll blast everything back to exactly the way it was, not just back

46:30.060 --> 46:32.800
up the data, but everything the way it was.

46:32.800 --> 46:34.280
And that's where CrashPlan Pro for him.

46:34.280 --> 46:38.040
I mean, that's like on the more managed side of services, and in that scenario, I think

46:38.040 --> 46:41.920
$120 a year, if you can afford it, is a reasonable amount for the kind of protection that you

46:41.920 --> 46:42.920
get.

46:42.920 --> 46:43.920
Yeah.

46:43.920 --> 46:44.920
Yeah.

46:44.920 --> 46:49.000
It comes always back to that question of how much do you, as a sys admin or a similar

46:49.000 --> 46:53.320
person who can do some things, is this something you outsource or is it something you roll yourself?

46:53.320 --> 46:57.000
He says when I kind of laid it all out with the wife, he says the spousal approval factor

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
is pretty high, especially when I mentioned the pictures.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
Yeah, right.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.120
That's an important one, though.

47:03.120 --> 47:07.480
We kind of invented digital cameras and then didn't come up with a reliable way to make

47:07.480 --> 47:08.960
sure you could keep those pictures.

47:08.960 --> 47:09.960
Yeah.

47:09.960 --> 47:10.960
A Spider Oak.

47:10.960 --> 47:15.480
So my thing has always been like, is what I use Spider Oak for is to back up Dropbox,

47:15.480 --> 47:20.280
which is like, it's like my belt and suspenders approach to Dropbox, but it's really excessive

47:20.280 --> 47:24.920
and it's really slow and it depends on one machine running that has both Spider Oak and

47:24.920 --> 47:25.920
Dropbox installed.

47:25.920 --> 47:26.920
It's like that's your sync machine.

47:26.920 --> 47:31.960
Why can't one connect to the other and just do it like cloud to cloud, you know?

47:31.960 --> 47:33.960
I mean, it's just servers.

47:33.960 --> 47:35.800
It's not like they don't need some desktop.

47:35.800 --> 47:36.800
It's all just Linux.

47:36.800 --> 47:38.940
Do they really need a desktop PC in between?

47:38.940 --> 47:40.320
They can't talk directly to each other?

47:40.320 --> 47:41.320
Give me a break.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.560
And of course, you're never going to get that with these closed source.

47:43.560 --> 47:47.040
So one of the things that a lot of people wrote into the show, a lot of people wrote

47:47.040 --> 47:49.520
into the show about was NextCloud.

47:49.520 --> 47:53.680
I don't think we've ever gotten more people suggesting NextCloud ever than we did in response

47:53.680 --> 47:54.920
to all of this.

47:54.920 --> 48:00.120
Off-site sync, but the thing that people really brought up was that's where I store a lot

48:00.120 --> 48:03.760
of my data that is resync.

48:03.760 --> 48:10.240
So calendar, contacts, photos, notes, they just keep them on NextCloud and then they

48:10.240 --> 48:13.680
reload the machine and then the NextCloud syncs that stuff back down.

48:13.680 --> 48:14.880
That's a pretty good way to do it.

48:14.880 --> 48:22.640
Yeah, but at the same time, like if it's critical data, I'm not like a security engineer or...

48:22.640 --> 48:23.640
Are you sure?

48:23.640 --> 48:26.160
That word's pretty legit.

48:26.160 --> 48:31.440
I don't trust myself to be able to take care of that data.

48:31.440 --> 48:34.200
That's why I'm wanting to offload it to another service.

48:34.200 --> 48:35.200
Geez.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.200
Yeah.

48:36.200 --> 48:37.200
Okay.

48:37.200 --> 48:38.200
That's fair.

48:38.200 --> 48:39.200
Yeah.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.200
Because that's what they do.

48:40.200 --> 48:41.200
Yeah.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.200
That's their thing.

48:42.200 --> 48:43.200
Yeah.

48:43.200 --> 48:44.200
They spend their entire day doing that stuff.

48:44.200 --> 48:47.400
I think that's what's sort of great about open source though is there is a good contingent

48:47.400 --> 48:49.960
of us out there that we are...

48:49.960 --> 48:52.520
I really kind of ebb and flow on it.

48:52.520 --> 48:56.840
Some stuff I'm willing to maintain myself and some stuff I'm willing to just like sort

48:56.840 --> 48:57.840
of off-site.

48:57.840 --> 48:58.840
Yeah.

48:58.840 --> 48:59.840
I agree.

48:59.840 --> 49:01.600
For me, it varies depending on how important what you're doing.

49:01.600 --> 49:04.640
How interested it is, how easy it is for you, and that kind of changes depending on what

49:04.640 --> 49:05.640
you do.

49:05.640 --> 49:07.040
How much it would hurt you if you lost it.

49:07.040 --> 49:08.040
Right.

49:08.040 --> 49:09.040
Right.

49:09.040 --> 49:10.040
Yeah.

49:10.040 --> 49:11.040
And backups though are...

49:11.040 --> 49:14.240
What I really dream of is something that is like a, is this possible?

49:14.240 --> 49:17.040
But maybe even like a 15-year system.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.880
Is that just ridiculous?

49:19.880 --> 49:20.880
These are your backups.

49:20.880 --> 49:27.520
These are your photos, and your music, and your documents, and your creations.

49:27.520 --> 49:30.480
You're going to want them for a while, right?

49:30.480 --> 49:32.960
And in the past, they would have all been physical things that would have gone in boxes

49:32.960 --> 49:36.500
that you would have stored somewhere ridiculously, and then your family would have to do something

49:36.500 --> 49:37.720
with when you died.

49:37.720 --> 49:38.720
But now I want...

49:38.720 --> 49:40.840
And were you making three copies of that that you put at different people's houses?

49:40.840 --> 49:41.840
Well, that's just it.

49:41.840 --> 49:45.640
The longer I go, am I just building up more and more shit that I'm going to have to keep

49:45.640 --> 49:50.160
converting to newer formats, drag to new cloud storage services, move to new types of open

49:50.160 --> 49:54.120
source programs that come online, hosted by new cloud providers?

49:54.120 --> 49:56.320
Am I just going to drag all this stuff with me?

49:56.320 --> 50:00.400
And the thing is, is the more dispersed it is, the less control I have over it now, the

50:00.400 --> 50:02.240
less flexibility I'll have down the road.

50:02.240 --> 50:07.560
You see, so there is some logic to all of these people writing in saying, use Nextcloud,

50:07.560 --> 50:10.760
because at least then you have some sort of escape hatch.

50:10.760 --> 50:15.320
Like right now, I got a ton of stuff in Google, and Google's going to be around for a really

50:15.320 --> 50:16.320
long time.

50:16.320 --> 50:18.640
Will I be using Google services for 15 years?

50:18.640 --> 50:19.640
I doubt it.

50:19.640 --> 50:24.000
And at some point, I'm going to have to come to that reality of having to migrate all of

50:24.000 --> 50:25.960
my crap out of their crap.

50:25.960 --> 50:27.520
Well, even with like, I've had that with the Dropbox.

50:27.520 --> 50:29.320
I just kind of just stopped using Dropbox at one point.

50:29.320 --> 50:30.840
I still had stuff in it.

50:30.840 --> 50:33.960
And then I have to make sure that my account stays open, or I have to then make sure that

50:33.960 --> 50:34.960
I migrate.

50:34.960 --> 50:35.960
So there are past issues.

50:35.960 --> 50:38.520
I did go through my entire Dropbox and remove everything.

50:38.520 --> 50:39.520
Mm-hmm.

50:39.520 --> 50:43.680
I think this is why some of us feel compelled to build like super NASes in our houses and

50:43.680 --> 50:50.000
just get something that has a ton of disk, and like Popey, just mine CryptoCoin and have

50:50.000 --> 50:53.120
a bunch of disks, and just keep it all local.

50:53.120 --> 50:57.200
You could Vericrypt stuff, maybe, and put stuff on these services.

50:57.200 --> 51:00.160
And use, of course, CFS to prevent bit rot.

51:00.160 --> 51:03.080
Well, that's just important.

51:03.080 --> 51:05.480
I'll just take a nap and let it back up to tar snap.

51:05.480 --> 51:07.160
I don't want to lose my Whopper coins.

51:07.160 --> 51:11.600
Well, you know, and a lot of them are like, duh, Chris, Nextcloud on DigitalOcean.

51:11.600 --> 51:15.680
I don't know if you've heard, Chris, but DigitalOcean is a really easy and quick way to spin up

51:15.680 --> 51:18.720
droplets in less than 55 seconds.

51:18.720 --> 51:21.200
Install BSD and get ZFS and SSDs.

51:21.200 --> 51:22.200
All right.

51:22.200 --> 51:24.440
So now this is sponsor time right here.

51:24.440 --> 51:25.440
DigitalOcean.com.

51:25.440 --> 51:28.920
Go over there, create an account, and use our promo code DOUNPLUGS.

51:28.920 --> 51:33.880
You'll get a $10 credit, and then you can spin up their $5 rig.

51:33.880 --> 51:38.800
I love their $0.03 an hour machine, because you get a lot of resources and a lot of memory

51:38.800 --> 51:42.780
and a lot of core and a lot of everything for $0.03 an hour.

51:42.780 --> 51:47.480
Everything you deploy will use SSDs from their really nice, low-end, like, you can't even

51:47.480 --> 51:51.280
believe how little you're paying for it systems, all the way to the systems that are monsters.

51:51.280 --> 51:55.560
Have you seen, like, their 200-plus gigabyte RAM systems and their new high CPU systems?

51:55.560 --> 51:56.560
High CPU.

51:56.560 --> 51:57.560
Yeah.

51:57.560 --> 51:59.760
And you can manage it all with a simple API, which means if you start getting more and

51:59.760 --> 52:03.320
more droplets, which does eventually happen, because they're great for everything.

52:03.320 --> 52:04.680
You can deploy them all over the world.

52:04.680 --> 52:05.840
You can get set up in seconds.

52:05.840 --> 52:10.500
You can get started with an entire open source stack or a single low-level OS.

52:10.500 --> 52:12.040
You're going to end up using the API.

52:12.040 --> 52:14.720
And the API is so well done, you're going to love it.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.720
Lightning fast networking, highly available storage.

52:16.720 --> 52:21.120
You can attach as you need up to 16 terabytes, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and

52:21.120 --> 52:22.120
use the FS.

52:22.120 --> 52:27.200
And use the FS, just like the beard was saying, because it shows up as a block storage device,

52:27.200 --> 52:29.880
and you could use that.

52:29.880 --> 52:30.960
Or you know what?

52:30.960 --> 52:31.960
You know what?

52:31.960 --> 52:34.040
You could make the SUSE folks happy, and you could use ButterFS.

52:34.040 --> 52:35.040
You sure could.

52:35.040 --> 52:36.040
You could play around with it.

52:36.040 --> 52:38.040
You know, I hear RAID 5 and 6 are pretty popular.

52:38.040 --> 52:39.040
Give that a go.

52:39.040 --> 52:42.040
See, the nice thing about DO is once you get tired of that, you just blow it away.

52:42.040 --> 52:44.680
One button click, one API call, it's gone.

52:44.680 --> 52:45.680
Yeah.

52:45.680 --> 52:50.120
And something that the ButterFS folks really love is they also have snapshots.

52:50.120 --> 52:54.000
So you can take snapshots of your system before you create some sort of a fence.

52:54.000 --> 52:58.840
In fact, because that API is really nice and well-documented, you'll find that there's

52:58.840 --> 53:04.160
open source projects that might integrate with your package manager that will actually

53:04.160 --> 53:09.600
take a snapshot of your DigitalOcean droplet before it installs all your packages.

53:09.600 --> 53:12.520
So if something blows up, you can revert right back.

53:12.520 --> 53:13.520
That's awesome.

53:13.520 --> 53:16.840
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

53:16.840 --> 53:19.640
Big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

53:19.640 --> 53:23.520
And thanks to everybody out there for using the DOUNPLUGGED promo code after they create

53:23.520 --> 53:26.540
their account at DigitalOcean.com.

53:26.540 --> 53:30.440
So this week, the smoke was revealed from, I'm sorry, the fire was revealed from the

53:30.440 --> 53:37.040
smoke that is the Librem 5, and the Librem 5 is Purism's attempt to build a GNU slash

53:37.040 --> 53:44.620
Linux powered open source phone that respects your privacy and your GNU slash freedoms.

53:44.620 --> 53:49.660
Now it's going to start around $600, which is actually a pretty reasonable price for

53:49.660 --> 53:51.520
a bonafide smartphone.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.080
That's the world we live in.

53:53.080 --> 53:59.120
And it's got one interesting element that out of all of the things about it impressed

53:59.120 --> 54:05.920
me, is its support for matrix phone calling.

54:05.920 --> 54:11.800
Now I have quite a bit of skepticism about a fundraiser for $1.5 million for a smartphone

54:11.800 --> 54:14.160
in 2017.

54:14.160 --> 54:18.240
But I thought before we really even go there, I thought I'd tell you a little bit about

54:18.240 --> 54:19.320
it.

54:19.320 --> 54:24.640
They say it'll be the world's first IP native mobile handset for a new kind of cord cutter.

54:24.640 --> 54:28.280
And that cord cutter is one that's cutting the cord from the cellular network, which

54:28.280 --> 54:33.040
I actually feel like is not to make this a sponsor thing, but sort of why I use Ting,

54:33.040 --> 54:36.300
because I just pay for what I use, and I try not to use the cellular network, because screw

54:36.300 --> 54:38.120
the cellular networks.

54:38.120 --> 54:39.120
Screw those carriers.

54:39.120 --> 54:42.360
And so Ting is sort of like my hack around that.

54:42.360 --> 54:45.640
And now apparently it just turns out I'm a new kind of cord cutter hipster.

54:45.640 --> 54:46.760
I didn't even know it.

54:46.760 --> 54:48.680
And all of you Ting users out there didn't even know it.

54:48.680 --> 54:50.600
And you're not going to get credit for it either, don't worry.

54:50.600 --> 54:55.200
And the other thing about this phone is it's not shipping iOS, it's not shipping Android,

54:55.200 --> 54:59.360
it's shipping PureOS, which is their Linux distribution.

54:59.360 --> 55:04.300
They're working with the Matrix Project to get that calling and texting.

55:04.300 --> 55:07.320
It's going to be like a full-fledged messaging platform.

55:07.320 --> 55:08.320
It's not just phone calls.

55:08.320 --> 55:11.000
It's going to have a five-inch screen.

55:11.000 --> 55:14.440
It'll have hardware kill switches for the camera, microphone, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and

55:14.440 --> 55:15.440
the baseband.

55:15.440 --> 55:16.440
That's a lot of switches.

55:16.440 --> 55:17.440
It is a lot of switches.

55:17.440 --> 55:19.720
It's kind of like spiky on the outside of the phone.

55:19.720 --> 55:20.720
Maybe.

55:20.720 --> 55:21.720
I'm wondering.

55:21.720 --> 55:22.720
I'm wondering about that.

55:22.720 --> 55:25.720
They're going to have a separate CPU and baseband.

55:25.720 --> 55:26.720
They're going to have...

55:26.720 --> 55:27.720
Really?

55:27.720 --> 55:28.720
Mm-hmm.

55:28.720 --> 55:29.720
Now, that's something.

55:29.720 --> 55:37.720
So, what do you think, Wes, 2017, to get in, to get a phone of any real substance, to get

55:37.720 --> 55:44.560
a phone and a charger, you got to back it at $599, $600 US, and estimated delivery is

55:44.560 --> 55:47.120
January of 2019.

55:47.120 --> 55:51.200
That's a long, that's a ways away.

55:51.200 --> 55:55.240
And I wonder, it just seems like there's been a hard time in the past to get these things.

55:55.240 --> 55:58.160
Like right now, if I could have that phone right now, yeah, all right, that seems great.

55:58.160 --> 55:59.160
I would try it.

55:59.160 --> 56:00.160
I would use it.

56:00.160 --> 56:01.160
I'm curious about it.

56:01.160 --> 56:02.160
A lot of that appeals to me.

56:02.160 --> 56:03.660
But that's a long time.

56:03.660 --> 56:06.640
We've seen things slip in these kinds of projects.

56:06.640 --> 56:11.200
And the money I'm paying is money today, will that really have sold the same value in a

56:11.200 --> 56:12.680
year and a half or whatever?

56:12.680 --> 56:13.680
Yeah.

56:13.680 --> 56:14.680
Yeah.

56:14.680 --> 56:17.480
This was a pledge that you could get this, they know that there's people who want to

56:17.480 --> 56:22.240
do it and are willing to give them money, but not taking the money even when the campaign's

56:22.240 --> 56:26.320
over, waiting until it's actually like a physical thing.

56:26.320 --> 56:27.880
That I'd be happy to do.

56:27.880 --> 56:33.860
But $600 for a phone in a year and a half, no thanks.

56:33.860 --> 56:40.200
What about something that sort of shakes up the whole iOS, Android death grip?

56:40.200 --> 56:43.960
No, as far as PureS is, what they're saying that they're doing is amazing.

56:43.960 --> 56:48.480
Like there are certain aspects of this phone that I would love it, especially the separate

56:48.480 --> 56:55.380
baseband thing, because that brings so much potential to the mobile platform as the Linux

56:55.380 --> 56:59.320
mobile advocate that I want to be.

56:59.320 --> 57:03.640
That is something that was fundamentally important.

57:03.640 --> 57:07.640
$1.5 million.

57:07.640 --> 57:10.480
55 days to go.

57:10.480 --> 57:12.920
They've raised 8.55% as we record.

57:12.920 --> 57:18.760
That's 128,000.

57:18.760 --> 57:21.480
So I think I was a backer of their first fundraiser.

57:21.480 --> 57:23.000
I think that's how I got the Librem 15.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.340
It's been a little while now.

57:24.340 --> 57:27.360
The reason why I lose track is because I've kind of lost track of how many fundraisers

57:27.360 --> 57:32.460
there's been, because I think there's been a couple of different fundraising campaigns

57:32.460 --> 57:38.760
at this point for different hardware, and I've kind of lost track.

57:38.760 --> 57:41.600
I don't know if this is a bad thing or not.

57:41.600 --> 57:45.280
Does it become a red flag if you're three or four fundraisers in?

57:45.280 --> 57:49.360
Does that indicate that perhaps this is starting to become a business model in which that every

57:49.360 --> 57:52.720
few years, or every year or so, you have to do a fundraiser to keep going?

57:52.720 --> 57:56.040
That was one thing I was kind of bring up, is I would almost have more confidence in

57:56.040 --> 57:59.840
this, at least kind of with the Yala stuff, it feels like there is more of this business

57:59.840 --> 58:02.720
angle and I can kind of get on board, or I have a little more faith that that will have

58:02.720 --> 58:07.160
the sort of traction or momentum to influence the industry, or at least take a bite out

58:07.160 --> 58:08.160
of it.

58:08.160 --> 58:13.080
So like you're saying, this sort of intermittent funding model, does that have the same sort

58:13.080 --> 58:16.600
of staying power that we need to actually get market share, which is what you need to

58:16.600 --> 58:18.920
get apps that people want and users that are using it?

58:18.920 --> 58:25.080
I guess it's a way to maybe fish out consumer demand before you go all in on a product,

58:25.080 --> 58:26.080
perhaps?

58:26.080 --> 58:32.360
Well, to me, it just looks more like they aren't making enough money that they can be

58:32.360 --> 58:34.940
able to do these projects themselves.

58:34.940 --> 58:38.400
Whether that's true or not, that's the perception it gives me.

58:38.400 --> 58:39.400
Hmm.

58:39.400 --> 58:42.120
Wimby, you're suggesting that they've created their own funding platform.

58:42.120 --> 58:43.120
I guess I hadn't noticed.

58:43.120 --> 58:44.120
You're right.

58:44.120 --> 58:45.120
This isn't Kickstarter IndieGoGo, is it?

58:45.120 --> 58:49.560
No, it's that they're using their own platform and I'm just wondering what people feel about

58:49.560 --> 58:50.560
that.

58:50.560 --> 58:56.080
Because if you're taking the money and managing it yourself, do we lose some of the oversight

58:56.080 --> 59:01.880
and having a place to go that's independent of the organization looking for the funding?

59:01.880 --> 59:04.520
And does it suggest this is going to be something that happens more often?

59:04.520 --> 59:06.520
Go ahead, Bobby.

59:06.520 --> 59:10.120
It also means that there's no publicly visible feedback.

59:10.120 --> 59:17.320
Like when I go to a Kickstarter or an IndieGoGo or many of the others, I know I can go and

59:17.320 --> 59:25.160
have a look in the conversations that people are having in the comments and the comments

59:25.160 --> 59:29.240
underneath the updates to see what the general feel of that project is before I'm going to

59:29.240 --> 59:30.240
back it.

59:30.240 --> 59:34.640
So all I've got is the mouthpiece of the people who are making the project, I'm less inclined

59:34.640 --> 59:38.680
to feel I want to contribute to that thing.

59:38.680 --> 59:42.720
And they don't actually provide any policy information like what their structure of payment

59:42.720 --> 59:43.720
is either.

59:43.720 --> 59:44.920
Well, okay.

59:44.920 --> 59:49.560
Not only that, but it doesn't make a whole lot of business sense to them because aren't

59:49.560 --> 59:54.440
they limiting their number of eyes to the people that visit their site?

59:54.440 --> 59:58.640
Well, and maybe they're just hoping that social outreach will...

59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.240
How do you really get people to your Kickstarter page?

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240
You've got to get...

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:06.440
I think they had to do this in order to be FSF friendly.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:11.940
You can't make a fully pure, fully free software device and then say, come on to this non-free

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:16.480
platform in order to back the thing like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo because they're all completely

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.480
non-free.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:22.800
I think one of them was on crowd supply, but I can see why they would want to do it on

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:26.200
their own site, but it smells a bit bad to me.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.600
It's not the first people to do that though because the new PG people did it as well.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.960
But I mean, okay, so that is an interesting thing to be aware of and something to consider.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:41.720
I mean, it does mean that you bypass whatever rules are in place, like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.320
have certain criteria that must be met before you can just...

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.840
You can't just throw any old project.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:51.160
I mean, it looks like that on IndieGoGo sometimes, but you can't just throw your project on there.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:56.640
There are some rules and there's some opportunity for recourse if things go bad.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:04.280
What opportunity for recourse do we have directly with purism themselves if there's no intermediary

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:11.060
who can say, this project went south and you need to provide some kind of remuneration

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:16.760
for the people who were done out of their cold hard cash.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:20.760
We also don't know if it's like a Kickstarter style or if it's like the IndieGoGo where

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.600
you can do both fixed or you get it automatically regardless if they meet the thing or not.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.480
Fix and flex.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:35.480
So outside of the payment platform, I mean, is there a bitterness developing around this

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:42.080
concept or is there still enthusiasm amongst us all gathered here today for a open source

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.600
Linux powered handset that you can in theory load any distro.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.280
This one will be shipping with a Debian derivative, which would support hooking up a mouse and

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:55.200
keyboard and an HDMI device and quote unquote convergence if you want to start X.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:59.680
The claim that it can run any Linux distribution is an interesting one given that it's an MX

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.400
board and therefore it would need, you'd need to have a target for that platform.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.400
It's an ARM board.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:08.640
The reason why it would be ARM, yeah.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.920
Technically any distro could run on it, but in practice somebody would have to enable

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.440
that hardware for that distro.

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:20.480
Well they also, because of the baseband that, because they're doing a separated baseband

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.440
with the firmware built into it, like that kind of.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.680
I understand that, but I'm just talking generally, you know, just, just everything about the

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.680
board.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:30.160
If something's not based on ARM for sure.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:31.160
Yeah.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.160
Who is that?

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:33.160
Who is that?

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:34.160
Oh, is that Poppy?

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.160
Oh, Poppy, you're breaking up.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160
Hold on.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.160
Say it again.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.160
Oh, sorry.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.160
Go again.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.160
Yeah, there you go.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:41.160
Now you're clear.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.040
So the thing that gets me is this is basically just a small computer.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:49.160
Like the GPD pocket that people have been raving about, the small computer that has

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:54.000
an HD display and a full size keyboard is like a tiny, tiny netbook-y kind of thing.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.680
It's not a distant step from that to the Purism device, right?

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.640
It's the, there are tricky things because it's a, it's got no hardware keyboard and

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:10.360
it's going to be used in a pocket with expected long battery life, but there's not a giant

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:15.960
leap from existing hardware that can run general purpose Linux operating systems like the GPD

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.960
pocket can.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.960
Okay.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.300
Modulo busted drivers for various things, but that'll get fixed.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:26.960
There's not a big leap from there to a mobile device that can run general purpose Linux

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.280
operating systems.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:32.520
And we're talking some time away for this thing to be delivered.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.880
So it's not unreasonable to think that that could be delivered.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:36.880
I agree.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:42.880
I, I, and, uh, I tell you, I agree with all of you that said that if it was shipping today,

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.680
it's something I would definitely consider purchasing.

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:45.680
Yeah.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.960
I'd already be having it in my cart right now and checking it out.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:57.000
You know, something I did notice about their announcement was they are not committing to

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.960
specific hardware as well.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:02.960
Which-

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:03.960
Or functionality.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:04.960
Yeah.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.400
It clearly states everything is subject to change.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.400
Yeah.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:14.520
So it's, it's like they're asking you to back it, but they're also not committing to delivering

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.120
you a specific product, which is really worrisome to me.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.320
Well, in a sense, like you could say that maybe because they don't want to commit to

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:26.440
the hardware specs because in a year from now or something like that, or six months

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:31.640
from now, the hardware specs would be, would be so much different that they wanted to upgrade.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.960
And if they already committed to a certain thing, people would expect that this way they

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.680
could say, well, we're going to upgrade it automatically and then you're going to get

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.360
a better, more RAM or a different type of RAM or something like that.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.360
Yeah.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:45.540
Well, just, just the other day, uh, they, uh, did an update on their blog and they said

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:50.680
that, uh, the general interest in the fundraiser so far has kind of got us talking more with

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:52.900
hardware manufacturers.

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:59.920
And based on their post here, what I grok is that they have a rough idea of what they're

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.920
targeting.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.920
They're targeting the processor.

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.400
They, I think it's going to be about four gigs of RAM and then they have a couple of

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.080
rough ideas, but I don't think they're super committing yet because it's all subject to

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.360
change because it is so far out.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.960
I think that's pretty much it.

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:18.880
Um, I wonder if we will be in not too distant future in a position where these kinds of

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:24.840
crowdfunding campaigns will be able to essentially print a device like this every time somebody

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:25.920
backs it.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.520
So the moment you back it, it's just on demand manufacturing.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:35.200
You don't have to secure 1.5 million orders because you don't have to preorder 300,000

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.200
units.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.780
You can, you can just print out a unit as they're, and of course printing, I'm using

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:46.720
loosely as a way to automate manufacturing, but you do have to wonder when will that scale

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:51.460
get to a point where they can do one-to-one ordering and it doesn't require a huge batch

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:56.200
purchase that has to be planned out for a year in advance because in some ways it feels

01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:02.120
like that's what's holding back true unfettered development of a free Linux phone.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:09.400
Because you would need something that was reasonably priced, that was reasonably functional,

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.120
and that people could actually get their hands on immediately.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:16.480
So the moment it started to tip into popularity, people could start ordering it.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:20.520
Like a Raspberry Pi Zero or a Raspberry Pi when they were brand new.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:25.400
Like those, there was a tipping point where resources were limited, but there were ways

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:32.960
to get your hands on it, and that's not possible for companies like Purism.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:35.800
They're in this position trying to get off the ground with a new product like this.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:41.800
I mean, to be fair, you could think about the fact that they don't have to set up deals

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.460
with different companies and OEMs and all this other stuff because they're not making

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:51.660
a software like an OS for a plethora of devices.

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:54.280
They're making one device and one OS for that device.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.920
So Michael, what do you think?

01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:03.400
If this doesn't work, is this dream dead?

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:08.760
No, I don't think it's dead because of UBports and Plasma Mobile, what they're doing, and

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.040
the Holium project is awesome.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.480
So it's just going to be a different version of the dream.

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:16.160
Instead of having the one ideal device you can buy that just comes all ready to go, it's

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.080
going to be you buy the hardware and then load your OS.

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.080
Right.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.720
It's going to be flash it yourself kind of thing.

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.720
Yeah.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.520
It's going to work for Linux on the desktop, I guess.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.520
Yeah.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:32.320
I think that's the most likely to happen in general, especially because all the projects,

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:36.480
especially ones that are working together, like the Holium project is a collaborative

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:39.700
project to work with multiple different approaches.

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.240
So I like that.

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:46.400
But I hope Purism is successful in this and makes a fantastic device because I would really

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.400
love to do it.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:55.800
I just can't convince myself to pay $600 for a dream.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:59.320
But I hope other people have money to risk on that.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:03.480
So feel free to back it so I can eventually get it.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:08.120
Well speaking of their hardware, arriving just in time for the show to give you a first

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:13.040
impression is what appears to be a brand new laptop from Purism.

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.560
So we'll talk about that in just a moment.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:19.600
Any closing thoughts, gentlemen, in the Mumble Room on the CrowdFunder?

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.480
Anybody that decided to back it want to chime in?

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:25.560
I'll kick it to you for final comment.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.100
I really wish them all success.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:35.900
Having worked on a phone that didn't succeed, I know this is hard, really hard.

01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:42.080
And even if you have a lot of people who are willing you on and are willing to get you

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:48.000
like a significant chunk of the way, like Ubuntu Edge got $12 million towards the $30

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
million target.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.120
And I know we didn't hit the target, but we got phones out in the market and we got an

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.040
operating system out there.

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.920
It was a lot of hard work and I think they're going to need a lot of help to get this done.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.360
I wish them all the best.

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:06.320
Todd says, just a few years later, all you need is $1.5 million now instead of $30 million.

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.200
Do you have any thoughts on that?

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:17.320
I don't know the mobile market well enough to know if that's actually true or whether

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.320
you'd get this.

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.800
I mean, bear in mind, these are two wildly different devices.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:31.640
The Ubuntu Edge was a unicorn and with everything that phones now already have, but for a general

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.640
purpose device.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.640
Right.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:39.320
So, I don't think, I think it's probably reasonable to say the numbers are lower.

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:40.320
Yeah.

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.760
The phone that they're going to be using is an ODM part, so I imagine most of this money

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.360
will go into funding the required software development.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.000
Oh, okay.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Well, we will have links in the show notes and I definitely would say I'm in the camp

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.680
if somebody would love to see this work out.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.080
To your point about the manufacturing, it seems like it's a shame that the way it's

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.800
gone never really involved the Linux Foundation because it seems like some sort of group like

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:08.080
that or something that could, for spanning multiple projects, facilitate and build those

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.880
reliable connections to the actual manufacturing community because we do it like re-spin these

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.880
up every time.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.280
It just can't scale.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.320
Maybe somebody's run the numbers and said, we're going to focus on the card instead.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.320
Right.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.320
Exactly.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:20.320
Oh, I don't know.

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:21.840
I don't know, but I'll tell you what.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.080
If they ever ship it, I'll run it on Ting.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:25.080
Go over to...

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.080
Were you going to say something?

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:27.080
Do you want to...

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.080
No.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.080
Oh, okay.

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:32.280
Linux.ting.com, Linux.ting.com.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.440
Not to get a burger, although that does sound delicious right now, but to get something

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:41.000
even cheaper and that's your mobile service plan for just $23 per month.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.320
That's the average cost of a Ting plan.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.280
That includes your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.400
The reason why is it starts at just $6 a month and then it's your usage on top of that.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:54.560
Nationwide coverage, no contracts, no quote unquote agreements.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.400
You just pay for any pairs that you use.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.280
And by pairs, I mean minutes, messages, or megabytes.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.280
That's what I call them now.

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:04.760
A fair price for however much you talk, however much you text, or however much data you use.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:09.400
You're always in control with their great tools, both on phone and their web app.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.480
You can buy a device directly from Ting.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.480
Really nice.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:15.080
The whole line of solid devices.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:18.840
Things that I think often people don't think of immediately when they think about getting

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.600
like a value Android device.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.240
Ting is really good about spotting devices that are going to get updates or they got

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:26.160
good functionality or they got great battery life and they're a great value.

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.800
Of course, they've also got all the Cadillac devices, both on the iOS and Android side.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.880
They have really fantastic customer service.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.520
But my favorite feature of Ting is paying for what I use.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:43.520
Because I feel like I am that hipster cord cutter for the new mobile age.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.000
I live on Wi-Fi.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.000
I live on Wi-Fi.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.600
I download my podcast before I leave.

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.480
I pin my music to my device.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:54.720
I have photos backed up only when I'm on Wi-Fi.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.320
It's perfect for when I'm on the go.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.480
All of it's local.

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:02.160
I don't want to be on the phone anymore when I'm driving anyways.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.560
Those are really only times I'm off Wi-Fi these days.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.760
Or if I may be out shopping or doing something on the holidays.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.240
That's why it's perfect for Ting to fill in the gaps.

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:15.120
CDMA and GSM networks, no contracts, no other termination fee, just $6 a month plus Uncle

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.680
Sam's tax and then whatever you use.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.040
I love it.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.120
Some months I'm a little busier.

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.720
Some months I'm not busy at all at all.

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.720
Really average.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.080
Still end up saving money.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.080
It's amazing.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.440
Also when you're over at Ting, linux.ting.com, check out their blog.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:33.840
They got a blog post about Ting offering internet, home internet service in the future.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840
Once?

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:35.840
Yeah.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.840
Read about that.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.840
I'm just going to have to move right over there.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:38.840
Linux.ting.com.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:43.280
So just in time for the show, the Librem came in here.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.760
This I believe is a replacement for the one that I kick started a long time ago that had

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.760
some cooling issues.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.760
Do you want to do the honors of the unboxing?

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.040
Oh sure.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:55.320
I did a little uncutting of the tape so that way you wouldn't have to like futz with that

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.320
on the show.

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:01.160
But ladies and gentlemen, right now Mr. Wes Payne is extracting a sub box from an outer

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.660
white box.

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:04.720
It says nothing but purism on it.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:05.720
He pulls it out.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:06.880
It says notebook on the box.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.600
All right, Wes.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:13.360
This looks like your average laptop box just as you would expect.

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:16.720
I would turn on the inside webcam but our Logitech camera died.

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:21.240
If anybody has any recommendations for really great wide angle high definition cameras that

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.000
work really well under Linux, tweet me at Chris Elias.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000
All right.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.520
So he's opening up the sub box right now.

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.900
What are your initial impressions, Wes?

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:29.900
Very normal packaging.

01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:30.900
Seems fine.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.360
Looks like I bought an Acer at Costco.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.360
Does it feel cold?

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.360
Is it metal?

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.360
Can you tell?

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:37.360
Oh it does feel cold.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:38.360
Yeah.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.360
There we go.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.360
Is it in a plastic wrap there?

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:41.360
It is, yes.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.360
Styrofoam on the sides.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.360
Nicely safe.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.360
It was not damaged.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.360
Is it heavy?

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:47.160
I mean it feels sturdy.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.160
In plastic case.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.160
Let's get this out.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.160
Oh yeah.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:51.160
It's dark.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.160
It's dark.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.160
I'd say it's like a black metal.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:55.160
It's like a midnight.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.160
It's got that same, you know, there's nothing on the top surface which I kind of like.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.160
It's elegant.

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.800
Oh, look at that.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.800
So let's see.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:10.920
We've got DC power in, two USB three slots, headphone jack, SD card reader on the side,

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:17.320
and then two more USB ports, HDMI out, and USB-C. Interesting.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.320
Not much else though.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.320
There's the power adapter.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.600
It doesn't appear to be much of a manual or anything else.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.600
How big is the power brick?

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:23.600
Just say that.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:24.600
Oh, not too bad.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:25.600
No, not bad at all.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.600
Pretty standard.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.600
Yeah.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.600
Yeah.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.120
So it's got a pretty big trackpad.

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.240
Typical barrel type power plug here.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.240
Purism button there.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:37.560
Oh, and there's those, there is those classic kill switches.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:40.860
So look at there in the latch, in the hinge of the laptop.

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:43.800
You see the kill switches right here along the, just underneath the screen.

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:44.800
Oh, yeah.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:45.800
Look at that.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:46.800
Yeah.

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:47.800
That's actually not a bad place for them.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.800
It's out of the way.

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.800
Yeah.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:52.600
So this thing has a sixth-generation i7 processor and it's using Intel graphics.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.040
I think it has 16 gigs of RAM and an SSD in there for the storage.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.680
I'll do a full review after I've had a chance to play with it.

01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.680
I just got it before the show.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.080
There's a little reset button on the bottom too, so that's like a physical reset.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.280
Like a classic PC reset button.

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.280
I kind of like that actually.

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.280
Yeah.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.280
That is kind of nice.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.240
I think it's using DDR4 RAM too, which should be, you know, nice and fast.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.240
What do you think about the weight and feel of it?

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.520
And maybe give a try of that keyboard too.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.620
I was trying to think of how, I'd say it's like an old-style MacBook keyboard.

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:25.560
So not the new, like the really, not the new really flat touch bar keyboard, but like the,

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.560
if anybody's tried those.

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.560
Yeah, right.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.560
Yeah.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.560
Not like that.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.560
You're right.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.560
It is kind of like that.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.560
Not too much flex.

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.560
Or like a later-generation, not like a great ThinkPad keyboard, but like one of the more

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.560
modern ThinkPad keyboards.

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.560
Yep.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.240
The travel's not amazing.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.960
I don't particularly like this enter key.

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.280
Some keys seem to be a little better than others.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.720
What do you think about that trackpad though?

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.720
That's pretty good.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.720
Yeah, not bad.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:48.480
Big size, nicely offset, and it's a little less smooth than I think I would like.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.480
You want to hit the power button?

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.480
But it works.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:51.480
You see it there?

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:52.480
I don't know where it is.

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.480
I don't know where it is on that thing.

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.480
Top right.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.480
Go ahead and power it up.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.480
Let's see if it's got a charge.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:58.480
It should be loaded with Pure OS.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.480
Yep.

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.480
It looks like it's powering up.

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.480
Wow.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480
Boom.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.480
Right there.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.480
There's the Purism logo right there.

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.480
Boom.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:06.480
Wow.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.480
And it looks like it's going right into a mem test.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.480
I'm not sure.

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.800
It looks like it booted right into mem test.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.800
Maybe that's all that's on there.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.600
That might be the hall that's installed.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.200
It's just mem test because it just booted right into mem test.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.520
I'm good with that actually.

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:19.520
That's fine with me.

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.520
I don't know what to put on there though.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:23.600
So that becomes, maybe that's what I should put Gen 2 on.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:26.800
I thought I'd be trying out Pure OS again.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:27.800
Maybe it is.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.440
So is that just like their customized like firmware image there that has their, I thought

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:32.680
that was going to be a Linux boot order.

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:33.960
Or it's just an image on the disk.

01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:37.440
A rumor has it that beta 1 of 1710 is coming out soon.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.880
That might be what I put 1710 on.

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.440
And by the way, it's silent.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.440
You hear that?

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.440
That's silent.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:49.080
You know, I got to give them credit.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.280
You know, it took them a few years, but they really came through.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.920
There is a fan in the same spot on the bottom pretty much.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.560
To be fair, the other one was pretty silent until you put it under any load.

01:16:58.560 --> 01:16:59.560
No, no.

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.560
No, it was 24.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.560
It was always.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.560
It was just full.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.000
You booted on it, it was full blast.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
You're thinking of the Galago.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.720
You're thinking of the Galago Pro.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:12.080
Yeah, no, the Librem was just full blast.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.560
So the other thing that I really got to give them credit for here is they also sent us

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.640
the Librem 13.

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.880
They sent it to Noah.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.720
And he didn't give it the best of review.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:27.000
So in the face of all of that, you got to give them credit for still coming through.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.760
I don't know if they would have done it if I didn't host this here show.

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:35.880
But the note I got from them was as an original backer, they wanted to make it right.

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:42.720
And the timing had nothing to do with the phone kickstarting, because the phone fundraiser

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:46.280
actually got moved up a few weeks, and this has been in manufacturing for much longer

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:47.280
than a couple of weeks.

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.200
Well, I got to say, I'll be very curious to see what you think of it, especially after

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:51.200
you load Gen 2.

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.560
I just said I think it's 1710.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.560
Sorry, Chris.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:57.520
Did I hear crux?

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:01.400
I really am feeling like beta 1 is going to be when I jump in on 1710 and start living

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.400
the 1710 lifestyle.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.400
And I think beta 1 is perhaps nigh.

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.400
The future is nigh.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.960
I wouldn't have expected FreeBSD.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.960
Wow, dude.

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:09.960
That's not what I said at all.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:10.960
That's not what I said at all.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.280
Do you want to hand it over to Beardsley to have him take a look at it?

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.280
See what he thinks of it.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:17.800
See what the beard thinks of the first impressions.

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:21.120
I'd like to hear your thoughts on that trackpad, too, Rekai.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.680
Feels really heavy, that's for sure.

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:25.640
But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:30.640
So yeah, so this is the Librem 15, and this is part of the second batch they've done of

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.640
these later models.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.320
It has a Core i7 Skylake in it.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:39.680
I think at 3.1 gigahertz with 16 gigs of RAM, DDR4 RAM at that.

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:46.280
It has a, I think, 1080p screen, and you can do M.2 in it, or an MVME drive.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.080
I think this one has an M.2.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.080
Yeah.

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:52.280
And it's got, instead of the Windows key, it's got the Purism button.

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.400
It's got a Theros wireless in it.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:19:00.060
It's got a hardware kill switch for the radios, the microphone, and the camera.

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:02.880
I'm not a big fan of the trackpad.

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.960
No?

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:09.600
It feels like I'm not just sliding my hand across it, I have to drag really hard.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.600
It doesn't feel very smooth.

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.600
It is a little more frictionless than I would want.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.600
Is it grabby?

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:14.600
Yeah, grabby's a good term for it.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.200
The keyboard, though, I really like.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.520
So this is, does it say on the back there, does it say version three?

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.520
Is that what it is?

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.880
Is that version three of the Librem 15?

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.880
Yep.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:24.880
Version three.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.880
Version three of the Librem 15.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:26.880
There you go.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.840
I'll let you guys know what I think about it after I've spent some time with it.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.440
It seems like a nice piece of hardware, though.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.240
The build quality actually seems really good.

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.240
And it looks nice.

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.560
I would not be ashamed whatsoever to have this in a coffee shop, especially with a few

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.920
Linux stickers on there.

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:44.760
I wonder if, I rubbed my grubby hands on it for a while, if my hand oils will smooth up

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:45.760
that trackpad.

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.520
Do the hardware kill switches look better than the first revision?

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.520
Yeah, way better.

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:53.840
Because in the first revision, they were just holes in the side of the laptop with black

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.240
toggle switches.

01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:57.680
And now you don't even notice them, do you, at first?

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:01.360
Now they're, I wonder if I could, can I pull up a picture?

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:07.400
It feels to me a lot like a very black MacBook.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:10.360
Now the kill switches are underneath the monitor somewhere.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:13.960
It's hard to explain where they're at, but they're above the F keys, below the monitor.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:19.360
There's like a little bit of flex by the hinge on the bottom, but otherwise it's very sturdy.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.360
So there you go.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.460
The new Librem 15 in-house.

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:23.600
How about that?

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.680
August 31st, says Wimpy.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.000
So that is, the rumors are true, Wimpy.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.920
Where'd he go?

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.920
There you are, Wimpy.

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.920
Sorry.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:33.920
That was my bad.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:34.920
Say again.

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:35.920
Yes, they are.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:42.320
It's August the 31st is the release date for beta, 17.10 beta 1 for the participating flavors.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:47.040
And I'm doing the corralling of the various flavors to do the release management for that

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.640
this time round.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:53.220
And if you go and grab a daily image for any of your favorite flavors today, is a good

01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:57.360
chance that that's probably what will get shipped on Thursday.

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:01.880
So at this point is mostly what we're seeing, what we're going to get, like the look of

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:04.840
it and the major software and all that.

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:06.840
Like pretty much now we're there.

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:07.840
Yeah.

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:11.360
So obviously proper Ubuntu doesn't participate in beta 1.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:14.960
You'll see that for the first time in beta 2 a month from now.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:15.960
Okay.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:20.680
But all of the flavors are participating in beta 1, which is out Thursday.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.680
Right.

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.680
Okay.

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:23.680
So including-

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.680
And the images get made-

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.680
Including that abuji mate that I've heard of before, I would assume.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:27.680
Yes.

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:29.160
That's looking very tasty for this release.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.880
Maybe I should put that on the early room.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:32.880
Yeah.

01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:33.880
I think you should.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:34.880
Yeah.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:35.880
You totally should.

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:36.880
I'll turn on Compass.

01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:38.840
I'll get my mutiny set up going.

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:42.080
That's exactly right.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.560
I do like Kaja.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.160
And I do like that software boutique.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:46.160
So you do get in there.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.920
And now that there's the super key, I mean, what's not to love?

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.180
That is true.

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.180
That is very true.

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:51.180
You probably live in there for quite some time.

01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:54.440
And the hud all up in your face and everything.

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.320
Which is now locally integrated, by the way.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.320
Oh, really?

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:58.320
Yeah.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:21:59.320
Nice.

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.320
Wow.

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.320
Wow.

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:02.320
This thing is...

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:06.200
This 1710 release, not just for Ubuntu proper, but for some of these flavors, too, is really

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.200
something.

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:08.200
What the hell happened?

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.200
Yeah.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:12.740
I think everyone's working really hard on their 1710 releases.

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:17.000
It seems like in the last couple releases, enough things have been changed or stabilized

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.980
in the below parts of the distro that there's really time now or effort that can be spent

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:24.760
on making all these things we've all been excited for.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.080
It's good timing for me since I'm distro hopping right now.

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.080
So the machine...

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.880
You know, what's great is I don't really have a horse in this race.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:34.120
So the machine that I'm recording this show on is running Arch.

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:37.980
The machine I'm sitting in front of, like showing webpages and stuff, is running Solus.

01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:41.240
And the machine the mumble room is on is on Ubuntu LTS.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:44.980
So I'm pretty much like I'm sitting pretty and whichever way this thing goes, I'm pretty

01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:45.980
much happy.

01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:49.480
I'm just sitting back and enjoying it and just trying out different distros at this

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:50.480
point.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:51.480
It's kind of a nice...

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.960
Have you heard of the Church of Neon?

01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:54.960
You know?

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:55.960
Yeah.

01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:56.960
Don't worry, buddy.

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.960
I got your back.

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:58.960
You know, it's funny is I do still have...

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:01.560
I still have a system at home running Plasma.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.720
And it's my one like...

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.740
It's still my one Plasma system.

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:11.480
And I sit down at it and I fired up and like, you know, this is so smooth and so nice.

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:12.480
I really enjoyed it.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:13.480
So, yeah.

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.480
It's still...

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:15.480
You're just a sucker for Kwin.

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.860
It's still a contender.

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:17.860
It's still a contender.

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:18.860
All right, Wes.

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:19.860
Well, you know what we got to do?

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.100
We got to get out of here.

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:22.360
Enough Linux for today.

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.360
We must go.

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.240
There is TechSnap to be had.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:27.360
Mumble Room, thank you very much for being here.

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.840
I really appreciate it, guys.

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:30.680
I think you just want to play with the purism.

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:31.840
That's true.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:32.840
That is true.

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:33.840
That is totally true.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:34.840
That is totally true.

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:39.200
Thank you to our Discord chat for hanging out with us at Discord.me slash Jupiter Colony.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.200
Thank you to Beardsley.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.200
Where should people find you, Beard?

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.200
Rec.net.

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.200
R-E-K-D.net.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.560
You can, of course, get more of Wes on TechSnap.

01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:46.960
Anywhere else you want to send folks?

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:48.040
At Wes Payne on Twitter.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.040
Boom.

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.840
Check out YouTube.com slash Chris Fisher.

01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:56.160
I just posted a brand new vlog today where I go inside a very creepy barn.

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:57.160
Thanks for joining us.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:23.960
I'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:41.880
All right.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.880
We did a podcast.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.960
We did a podcast.

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:44.960
Thank you, Mumble Room.

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:45.960
Thank you, IRC.

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:46.960
Yeah.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.960
That was some good mumbling today.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:48.960
Thank you, Discord.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.560
So we got to pick our title.

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:55.040
And I thought maybe should we do something around the Librem, the purism, like the hope

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:58.160
of the free Linux phone?

01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.160
Something like that?

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.160
What do you guys think?

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:01.160
Bueller?

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:02.160
Librem free phone.

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:03.160
Phone's home.

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.640
What about Librem 5, a new hope?

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.360
The new hope thing's played, man.

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:11.360
It's played.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:12.360
It's played.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:13.360
I don't know.

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:14.360
Okay.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.360
How about Librem 5, the Phantom Menace?

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.360
What do you think?

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:17.360
Anybody?

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:20.160
Mumble Room thoughts on titles?

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:23.160
Mobile Linux purity.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.600
Uh.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:29.160
We could just call it Pure Linux.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.920
No.

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.760
No.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:40.200
What about something about the free phone dream?

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:43.840
Should it just be the free phone dream?

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:44.840
Free phone nightmare continues.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:45.840
Free phone?

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:50.320
No free phone nightmare.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.960
The free phone nightmare is not bad either.

01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.560
Librem.

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:57.560
The free phone nightmare.

01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:00.320
Floss nightly.

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.320
Phoning it in.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:03.320
Oh, I think we've maybe done that.

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.280
Yeah, I think that does sound familiar.

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.280
It does.

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:07.280
We're so punny.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:11.800
It's not our fault, it's our culture.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.160
The free phone nightmare is kind of my current leading.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.400
I like that one.

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.160
It's pretty good.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:18.160
Librem phone's home.

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:23.200
No, it doesn't do that, I swear.

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:52.200
That's deliciously ironic, I like that.
