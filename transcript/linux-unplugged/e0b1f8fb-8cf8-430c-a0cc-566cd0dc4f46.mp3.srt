00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 6 for September 17th, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,360
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, a weekly unscripted Linux podcast that's been taking RMS a little

3
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,120
more seriously. It's brought to you by our fine sponsor Ting.com. I'll tell you more

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,000
about how great Ting is as the show goes on. My name is Chris and my name is Matt. Welcome

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,520
back from the trip. Thank you. Thank you. Good times. How was the trip? It was unbelievable.

6
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,560
It was just what the doctor ordered. Oh, I bet. So I think I saw your waterfall picture.

7
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,760
That's what it was. Yeah, we went out to Lake Chelan here in Eastern Washington and it was

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,760
just amazing. Yeah, I showed that to the kids. They're like, I don't want to go there. So

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,480
that sounds like a must do. And you did it just at the right time. It wasn't probably

10
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:22,280
too hot, right? Oh, yes, it was. When we first got over the mountains, we were about 101,

11
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,600
I think it averaged in the mid nineties, the rest of the trip. Oh, wow. So I forget, you

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,800
know, like you were just saying on the pre show, uh, there is a whole nother side to

13
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,840
our state that is like a completely different state. It really is. Yeah. It's fascinating

14
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,040
when you go over those mountains, how warm it gets. Well, uh, we've got a big show. Guess

15
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,440
what? Big show. Uh, so this week I want to talk a little bit about losing the flame for

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,640
Android. Uh, if you've followed this week's Coderator, you probably know where I'm talking

17
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,760
about what we're going to get into it on this backing up a Linux server and a set it and

18
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,720
forget it way. I'd like to maybe pick the mumble server, uh, their brain folks on the

19
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,240
mumble server. And then of course we've got our feedback on our follow-up as always, but

20
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,920
nothing planned, nothing planned. I'm just saying, I'm just saying, so why don't we just,

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,040
why don't we bust through some quick F U that's what I'm labeling the follow-up is F U, the

22
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,320
F U segment, the F U segment. And, uh, the, probably the first thing, uh, oh, you know

23
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,640
what I need, I need like an F U a segment here. Let's see, maybe this could be our F

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,080
U segment bump. He's a jackass. What do you think that works? I, you know, I think it's

25
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,120
short sweetened. It's a, to the point. All right. Well, so I remember last week during

26
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,520
the news segment on the Linux action show, we were saying that a system D a number build

27
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,480
207 is coming to, to all of a distributions near you that run system D and that there

28
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,960
was that Etsy sys tl.com file that I was wondering if arch users were going to get bitten by.

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,800
Exactly. I specum allocated out loud in the, uh, in the show and we had a few people write

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,320
in and, uh, tell us what's up with that. And they pointed us to the source of all knowledge

31
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,400
in arch and that is the arch Wiki. And actually in this case is the news section. Uh, uh,

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,560
and it is, you will have a little bit of work to do if you've been using it, but however,

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,000
if you have a fairly recent installation, you probably don't have anything in there.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,720
There is a Sim link you need to do if you do have config info in there. And if you don't

35
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,860
just go look at that file and if you really haven't said anything in there, you don't

36
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,960
have to worry. Good times. I love that. I love the fact that their Wiki really spells

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,720
it out in a real clean, easy to follow way. Yeah. Following the arch news and there's

38
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,480
also a mailing list you can follow is always a good step. I, um, I don't always check before

39
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,960
I, before I, before I run it. Uh, but I, I generally try to, and we're going to have

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,320
a, we're going to have an email, um, coming up a little bit later in the show about the

41
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,680
arch challenge again, King backup. And so I thought we'd cover that and let people know.

42
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,100
There's also another email. Actually, this was a bit message we got and they said in

43
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,840
last episode of last, you talked about note taking programs, which by the way, some people

44
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,680
loved Matt and then some people hated, some people were down with it. Well, you know,

45
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,080
some people take notes and other people have that mega memory thing going on. So yeah,

46
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,120
okay. Yeah, I guess so. Uh, but one that didn't get mentioned. And so our bit messenger wanted

47
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,840
to make sure I gave it a shout out is cherry tree. Cherry tree, I think has gotten some

48
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,520
love on the show. I want to say it might've been a pick at one point. Cherry tree notes

49
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,080
is great though. And it's got, it's got its own good, uh, like it supports rich text formatting.

50
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,000
It's got its own syntax. You can, uh, you can follow. And, uh, I have not actually, uh,

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,120
used it beyond like, you know, trying it out to see if it would do my, what I wanted for,

52
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,920
I don't remember what it was about if it didn't quite grab me. Maybe it was the way it implemented

53
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,960
X, Y, and Z or whatever it was. Sure. The UI actually, to be honest with you, it's sometimes

54
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,640
with note taking part of it is like, um, you know, you got to work in this space. You got

55
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,100
to live inside this application. So, well, I know UI is a big, it's an important part

56
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,840
of your space because it's, you know, you, you're very UI centric. And so for me, it's

57
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,720
a lot of times of, you know, can I, I don't know, ham fist through it. And a lot of times

58
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,880
I'll put up with a lot of that kind of stuff. I don't know. I'm looking at it now and it's

59
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,840
honestly, I don't, I doesn't look so bad, you know, it definitely kind of has a QT feel

60
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,480
to it. So yeah. So I thought, um, uh, one last bit of followup that I wanted to get

61
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,920
to, uh, because I wanted to spot to talk about this where people wouldn't be like, oh, you

62
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,560
guys are just saying this because they sponsor you. Right? Sure. And that is today the new

63
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,280
system 76 rig was launched. Now remember last week we said they're going to have a new leopard

64
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,800
extreme coming. They're calling it, I think they're calling it like the leopard X four,

65
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,400
the Leo X four. I'll pull it up here while we talk about it. Um, so system 76 sponsors

66
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,320
Linux action show, but they don't sponsor this show. Um, but we are both personally

67
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,560
fans of system 76. That's one of the reasons we were able to twist their arm to come on

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,920
board. Oh yeah. And so they updated today, their leopard extreme rig, man, have you had

69
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,600
a chance to look at this thing? I was looking through it and it's just like, I mean, first

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,160
of all, the first tip I would give anyone looking at the pictures is prior face off

71
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,960
the screen so you can actually take in the images because I was so busy trying to like

72
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,200
throw my money at the screen and get it, you know, like trying to like make it materialize

73
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,960
in front of me that I wasn't able to fully appreciate it till I pulled away a little

74
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,640
bit and I looking at it, it looks really powerful. I've already done a few builds. Yeah. They're

75
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,520
using a Corsair, um, um, water cooling solution. I've used the similar water cooling solution

76
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,960
and it's really cool because what it does is it's not very complicated. It just runs

77
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,840
to a radiator. I believe I'm guessing based cause I have a similar model. It runs to a

78
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,520
radiator that's connected to your 120 millimeter fan in the back of the case. And so it's,

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,400
it just uses the regular case cooling to cool it. So you don't have to have like a radiator

80
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,620
sitting on top of the rig. Um, and, and so this to me is one of those things where I

81
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,980
think the first reaction a lot of people are going to have is it's probably too expensive

82
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,280
because it is a, it's a highly priced machine. It's for, it's a high end machine for folks

83
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,680
that want high end performance and a high end experience without having to monkey with

84
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,700
something themselves. I think that's the real differential. This is a total pro level machine.

85
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,980
So like here, I thought I'd, so if I was going to build a machine, I would get the six core

86
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:44,160
fourth gen Intel I seven, which runs at 3.4 gigahertz. I would get 32 gigs of Ram. Uh,

87
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,360
probably because if I'm going to have a machine this nice, I also want to play video games

88
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,960
and I also use GPU accelerated functions. So they have an Nvidia graphics card here that

89
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,720
has a 5, uh, 1,500 CUDA cores. Uh, that would be the one I'm going to go with kind of expensive,

90
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,520
but I could use that. Um, I would probably not go rate. I'd go a 240 gigabyte SSD for

91
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,760
the primary hard drive and then maybe like, uh, I probably keep it as tight as I needed.

92
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,380
Three terabytes would probably be enough for my working space for my scratch. Oh yeah.

93
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,080
You know what'd be awesome with this too is if you're someone that does a lot of VMs like

94
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,880
simultaneously and you just don't care about, you don't want to have to think about do I

95
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,360
have too many running or whatever, that would be fantastic. Anything that's really performance

96
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,160
intensive. It actually clocked in less than I thought, uh, 30 at $3,059. Oh, that's actually

97
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,400
a lot. So now I would have figured for, I'm going to go to apple.com slash door. And the

98
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,080
reason why is because I'm comparing this leopard extreme to the Mac pro. I think this is for

99
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,000
content creators is for people who want, um, you know, like if I'm a plumber, I get myself

100
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
a real special kind of, this is not to compare the Mac mini to, uh, the extreme is to prepare.

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,200
I would go a slightly slower processor, but I would go two cores, uh, or, uh, this is

102
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,720
yeah. Six core. Now this is a Xeon 32 gigs of Ram. Um, let's go. We can't do, we'll do

103
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:11,180
a fire already without even going to step two at 61 99. No, and I'm at 7,500. Wow. Crap.

104
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,320
And the thing looks like a trashcan. So we'll know that we don't even know what the price

105
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,200
of that one's going to be. But my point is, is this leopard extreme is this is a professional's

106
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,800
computer. This is something that I, you know, if Chris Buysie writes off on his taxes, right?

107
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,400
This is, that's what this is now. I just even the next gen a Mac yet, or is this still the

108
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,920
old one? That's the old one. So this is the one that looks like a computer. But I think

109
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,480
this, because it's, it's got, it's a tower. So it has PCI express slots available to you

110
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,960
where the new trashcan doesn't like, I think as more people move to Linux for certain functionality,

111
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:44,560
I've been looking at a new generation of media production apps. Uh, one that just hit the

112
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,760
subreddit today. It's an audio editing application. It's in beta. I've been keeping an eye on

113
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,880
it. Um, and then another one that a video editing application that hit the subreddit

114
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,860
a couple of days ago that is yes, once again, another video editor, but I actually edited

115
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,140
a mock episode of Linux unplugged in that video editor last weekend. And I, it actually

116
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:09,680
wasn't perfect. It definitely wasn't as fast as my current workflow, but it was the closest

117
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,720
I've ever gotten to taking non-native Linux codecs. These were ProRes codecs, bringing

118
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,720
them into a Linux editor, assembling it the way I need it with the music cues and the

119
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,320
transition spots and, and then export it out to a file, a master file that I can then encode

120
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,320
on the distributed machines that produce all the different file formats. Um, it, it like

121
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,200
actually the whole process from end to end actually happened in this, in this environment

122
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,600
like on a Linux box. It was amazing. And so we're definitely very close to the point where

123
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,600
if I changed a few behaviors and if I changed a work, a few workflow things and I was willing

124
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,240
to live with maybe a little less quality, maybe, you know, silly things too, like night

125
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,300
is not, not as nice transitions, maybe a reduction in audio quality slightly because this didn't

126
00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:02,020
have any audio processing. Um, we are at the point where I actually think this could all

127
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,400
be done on Linux. And that's pretty exciting because then it starts, you start looking

128
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,440
at this like the celebrity extreme and now it's actually like, you know, we're really,

129
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,560
really close. Um, and I think I could do 70% of it today on that. So I'm really excited

130
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,920
about it. I'm going to, you know, I'm not sure I'm ready because honestly the Bonobo,

131
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,120
uh, with its, I mean the thing has two hard drives, so my IO problem is solved. They're

132
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,480
both SSDs. It's a core I seven, it's got 16 gigs of Ram. So the Bonobo has done so well.

133
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,760
So I'm, I'm like, do I just run it on the Bonobo or do I maybe do this towards the end

134
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,780
of the year as like a, you know, 2013 taxes thing? I don't know, but I'm really excited

135
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:43,120
about it. I say hats off to system 76, that elaborate extreme. I think people can think

136
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm, I think I'm crazy for saying this, but I think it looks like the best computer for

137
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,240
Linux for this year, maybe even 2014. Oh, that's not even a question. I mean, you just

138
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,300
look, I mean, as you just did the comparison with the Mac, there was no question there

139
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,640
at all. And then of course, as far as knowing the machine is going to be built to the specifications

140
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,880
you want and everything just works, it's got a solid warranty. The company's been around

141
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,880
for a long time. It's just a win-win. So yeah, it looks really good too. I like the look

142
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,480
of it too, the size and anyways, really excited. And, uh, I emailed them asking them for a

143
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,120
demo unit. So we'll see, I know that would be fantastic. Their inventory is tight and

144
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,640
they're building a lot of them in the U S now and that makes it even tighter. So I know

145
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,360
it's, it might not happen, but I thought I'd, I'd put it out there. Doesn't hurt. Yeah.

146
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,680
Yeah. All right, Matt. Well, before I get to what's been troubling me this week, deep

147
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,880
down on the inside and why I think maybe RMS has been right all along and we just haven't

148
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,440
been receiving his wisdom and now I'm rethinking everything. I want to talk about our sponsor

149
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,920
this week and that my friends is ting.com. Look, if you go to linux.ting.com, we've got

150
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,640
a landing page for you built just for you, customized just for you. Now ting is mobile.

151
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,960
That makes sense. They're a completely new way of doing mobile and they give me a lot

152
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,180
of hope for the future of this industry. First of all, probably the biggest differentiator,

153
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,400
no contracts, no early termination fees and you pay for what you use. So you get a line,

154
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,280
it's $6 a month. If you use a hundred minutes, you end up just going to that hundred minute

155
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,560
bucket and that's what you pay. Ting takes your minutes, your megabytes and your messages

156
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,480
and they add them all up at the, at the end of the month. And if you're like me and you're

157
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,080
a little bit savvy on your voice, some months I squeak away with hardly any voice minutes

158
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,280
at all. And my bill is about as low as it can get. It's usually in the $12 to $15 range.

159
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,680
Average price, average bill on ting for a ting customer is $22 or $21. I'm sorry. Uh,

160
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,200
so you know, it's a pretty reasonable price. It's not only that, but they have a good range

161
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,680
of phones from pre pre-owned phones that you can get at a great discount feature phones

162
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,880
and also high end phones like the HTC one, which is, which has fantastic speakers, which

163
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,720
is great for podcasts listening, but also has incredible screen, which is great for

164
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,160
watching content like our shows. So when you go over to ting, you might notice if you play

165
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,960
around that they've got some shots of their dashboard. That's actually what their dashboard

166
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,000
looks like. It is legitimately that beautiful. It is legitimately that easy to use and it

167
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,120
is very functional. You can do everything from porting a phone, deactivating a phone,

168
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,000
buying a phone, transferring a phone, anything for their website. Matt, what was your impression?

169
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,420
You know, you're on ting too. You got, you got the note too. What was that process like

170
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,620
setting that up on, on the ting website?

171
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,560
Setting it up was surprisingly simple. I was amazed that even though I had to release the

172
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,840
phone from its original owner, which was you, that only took like a couple seconds, uh,

173
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,880
just using their help file. And once that was done, the actual setup process, I think

174
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,760
was under like a two minutes, minute and a half. It was something crazy. I didn't have

175
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,760
to talk to anybody, even though you can get a real person if you do. But it was awesome.

176
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
It was so easy.

177
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,720
Yeah. Ting, uh, ting also has a great blog where they're actively posting the stuff that

178
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,700
they think people that are ting users might be interested in because the ting customer

179
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,240
base I think is a little savvier than your average bear. And so here's five things you

180
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,920
didn't know your smartphone could do. Matt, this is totally, totally up your alley. Remotely

181
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,600
control your electronics. They highlight these Belkin Wemo switches that integrate with an

182
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
app.

183
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
That's awesome.

184
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,280
Yeah. So you can control your different devices, scan high quality documents, play laser tag.

185
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,160
And here's one that I really like. Measure the speed of a moving object. They talk about

186
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,160
this app called speed gun that lets you, you take speed gun, you pointed at something that

187
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,280
moves across the frame and it tells you how fast that thing is moving. How cool is that?

188
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,920
Pick up a notch. And you said they have, you can do laser tag. They have an article telling

189
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
you this. This is cool.

190
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,480
Yeah. They got laser tag. They got laser tag. Yeah. It was called app tag and it's designed

191
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,840
to let you play. Yes. Ting blog is awesome. But one of the things that I caught on the

192
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,380
ting blog recently is they're doing early termination fee relief. So if you're in a

193
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:29,000
contract now and you really want to get out and you want to start saving money, you want

194
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,280
to move over to ting because you love that included hotspot. You love that included tethering.

195
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,400
You love the fact that they don't bundle anything along that you wouldn't expect. You love the

196
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,600
transparent nature of the company and you love what they're about. Maybe you want to

197
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,480
get out of that contract a little early. Now ting is going to help you with that. They're

198
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,080
going to take up to 75% off of that early termination fee. So all you have to do, get

199
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,440
your ting phone, you activate it and then you send them your ETF claim and they'll cut

200
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,880
you a check right there or actually maybe a credit. But think about that. Think about

201
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,440
how awesome that is. It helps not only relieve the blow of having to cancel that contract,

202
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,020
but then it just increases the amount of money you're going to save on the long run by switching

203
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:07,880
to ting. So go to linux.ting.com. Take $25 off your first device or $25 off your first

204
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,640
month of service if you're going to bring your own device. In fact, they even have a

205
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,240
concierge service to help find a used device for you so you can get a great deal on a device.

206
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,800
I love that. And if you've got somebody on maybe in your family that doesn't want a very

207
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,600
powerful phone, you can still bring them on, have a shared family pool of minutes with

208
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,680
unlimited lines and you can just give them a feature phone because ting has some great

209
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,280
feature phones. Yes, they're still a thing. They're out there. So awesome things got them

210
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,000
including some of the best android devices. So thanks to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged

211
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,440
stuff. So one of the things that RMS warned us about, Matt, was that TiVo... It's negative

212
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:48,680
in the freedom dimension. Remember, he was quite concerned about the TiVoization of Linux.

213
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,240
And in fact, you could say that maybe that was a huge inspiration for a lot of the provisions

214
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,160
in the GPL3. I think so. I think that was definitely something that they forced them

215
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,640
to take a second look at that. And now we're looking back at it and it's like, oh my God,

216
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,480
he's right on a lot of stuff. I think the TiVoization... I think what TiVo has done

217
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:14,360
to Linux is quaint and adorable in comparison to what Android has done to Linux. I think

218
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,120
what has happened where you have an open source operating system where the core is open and

219
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,520
then there's layers of stuff on top of it that are Apache licensed and then there's

220
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,100
layers on top of that that are just commercially, you know, whatever their commercial proprietary

221
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,440
licenses and then Google takes this, all bundles it all up and hands it out to these OEMs that

222
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,800
then inject their proprietary code at the firmware level, at the radio level, at the

223
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,720
OS kernel level, at the user land space level, and even in the services level with the cloud

224
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,620
services these things connect to. Every single layer, we take this open source operated open

225
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:51,640
platform and we inject this proprietary code and lock down into it at all different levels.

226
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,840
We bastardize this thing. We make it an embarrassment of the original intent and then we ship it

227
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,840
as a product out to consumers and then to make matters worse, not only have we developed

228
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,480
one of the most incredible fast-moving open source projects that has thousands of intelligent

229
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,160
contributors making the thing better every single day, but we managed to figure out a

230
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,320
way to ship a product running that that doesn't receive updates.

231
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,440
That's right. And people are excited to get new ones, you know, that are literally oftentimes

232
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,560
running the same OS as the phone they just had.

233
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,760
So I'm at a point now and I think it's one part NSA inspired fear mongering because like

234
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,760
maybe it just has me thinking about cloud services in a different perspective, right?

235
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,800
I think it had, yeah, I think it, for you, it has a lot to do with that. I think it has

236
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:38,680
a lot to do with, I want to find devices and tools that compliment my desire to internalize

237
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,800
my own personal cloud in my own land, not outside of it.

238
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:47,160
Right. Yeah, exactly. Create your own cloud. Um, and I, so I, I think I'm not, I don't

239
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,280
want to start this off to, to slam Android because I think Android is a really great

240
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:58,520
solution for a lot of people that offers a lot of great features over the other alternatives.

241
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,240
Let's take the number one alternative iOS and let's just, you know, here's a great one

242
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,080
off the top of my head. Swabbing out the keyboard. We were talking about this on the pre-show.

243
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,720
The fact that the fact that iOS still has this, this ridiculous keyboard. I mean, it's

244
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,080
a, it's kind of an embarrassment, right? So I'm not, I don't mean to demean Android or

245
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,780
demean anyone who chooses it to use it as their mobile platform because I think there's

246
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:24,680
a lot of merit to the platform. However, I have to bring up issues with what, what Google,

247
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,640
I think Google has been a bad steward of this operating system.

248
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,560
I think they have left consumers in vulnerable positions. I think it is not an exaggeration

249
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,640
to call year old Android devices exploits in the pocket. I think that's exactly what

250
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,440
they are. But, and I acknowledge there are power user solutions to this, like replacing

251
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,680
ROMs and other things, but they're not a solution for the majority of people. So I want to couch

252
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,920
this by saying I'm about to get a little ranty on Android, but I don't, I don't want anyone

253
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:57,320
to take that as judgment because I, I'm not saying there's a perfect solution here, but

254
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,520
I'm looking at this now, Matt. So this last week in a Linux action show, I ended the,

255
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,160
the Android app picks. I didn't say anything to you because it was just something internally

256
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,800
to me that like, I just knew I was done doing this. And I said in the show, I don't want

257
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,920
to, you know, I don't want to make a big stink about it in the Linux podcast of record in

258
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,440
the big show, but I said in the show that I didn't feel like I need to evangelize this

259
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
platform anymore.

260
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,760
Yeah. I remember. And it was, it was for me, it was cause I knew nothing really any backstory

261
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,000
to it. It was very sudden and I figured it must have been okay. Maybe it's just burnout

262
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,080
on talking about apps. Okay. Yeah, that's cool.

263
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:38,080
So I feel like it's probably, it's, it's deeper than that. I think I've been rethinking cloud

264
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,680
services. I've been rethinking the treatment of this open platform by the carriers, by

265
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:51,240
the OEMs and by Google. In fact, I have a, I have a quote here from RMS that I, I, you

266
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,520
know, it's been interesting as some of this stuff has come out, either be the, either

267
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,920
be the NSA stuff or looking at the situation with Android. A lot of stuff that RMS said

268
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,120
a while ago actually rings true with me now. And he was just kind of ahead of us. And so

269
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,240
here, here's the point. So in an interview by the Guardian, Richard Stallman was asked

270
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,560
whether Android should be considered free or open, right?

271
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
Sure.

272
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,840
So RMS responds with Google has complied with the requirements of the GNU general public

273
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:26,200
license for Linux, but the, but the Apache license on the rest of Android does not require

274
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,880
source release. Google has said it will never publish the source code for Android 3.0 aside

275
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,120
from the Linux component. And even though executables have been released to the public,

276
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,080
Android 3.1 source code is also being withheld. Thus Android 3, apart from Linux, is non-free

277
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,840
software pure and simple. Android is a major step towards an ethical user controlled free

278
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:50,200
software portable phone, but there is a long way to go. Hackers are working on Replicant,

279
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,520
but it's a big job to support a phone model. Uh, I'm sorry, a new phone model and the remain

280
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,360
and then there remains the problem of the firmwares. Even though Android phones of today

281
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,000
are considerably less bad than Apple or windows smartphones, they cannot be said to respect

282
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,800
your freedom. And the part that I challenge there is I was, I think one of the things

283
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,280
that sort of started to shift my perspective on this is I watched and I watched it happen

284
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,760
in our community and I watched it happen on the internet in general. When the iPhone five

285
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,280
S was announced, everybody took to the web proclaiming that the fingerprint scanner was

286
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,760
an NSA mass collection device and that this would be used to track iPhone users fingerprints.

287
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,280
But I didn't see the same outcry when Android face detection launched or when the Moto X

288
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,440
launched with always listening capabilities. Well, let me ask you this, and I'm asking

289
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,320
this from someone that's not familiar with what's mandatory, what's not on the iPhone.

290
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,980
Is that a mandatory feature or an optional feature? Optional. Okay. And on the Android,

291
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:57,960
is that a mandatory feature or an optional feature? Uh, for the face unlock? Yeah. Optional.

292
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:04,400
Both are optional. From that perspective, I award Darwin awards to people that choose

293
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,960
to use them. Right. Well, yeah, there's that, right? And there's, there's a, there's a,

294
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,960
there's a whole series of issues like, uh, like wire point out, like pleading the fifth

295
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,040
when you use your fingerprint or your face to unlock. But well, I think my point was

296
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,440
as people, I feel like our community doesn't think critically about these things. Like

297
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,520
one's always good, one's always evil. I would say that by and large, that's true.

298
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,920
But I think it, I think it's, we look at the lesser two evils, like most people do politically,

299
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,800
I think at that, I think, and that's, and I don't, I don't support that idea, but I think

300
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,080
that's kind of where we're at. And so for each individual, one of us, the most powerful

301
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,160
thing we can do is to have the discussion we're having now talk about the good, the

302
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,680
bad, the ugly, and the choices that each one of us need to reflect on to make the decisions

303
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,240
that's right for us. I think, you know, I'll get some crap because I was particularly hard

304
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,400
in code or radio. Um, but really I think it's being just intellectually honest with yourself,

305
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,880
reanalyzing this stuff and, you know, making sure that it all, it all checks out, you know,

306
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,080
passes the sniff test. Absolutely. So I think you nailed it. I think it's picking the less

307
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,540
of two evils, right? And I think some of us sort of assume Google is less of two evils

308
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,800
because well, Google does summer of code and Google also often mentions things are open

309
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,800
and I love open and better marketing to geeks, quite frankly, right? Right. Yeah. And then

310
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,800
their slogan is don't be evil. I mean, so your first impression is okay, they probably

311
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:26,680
a good guys. Uh, but I, I just, I think that is not necessarily the case. I think there's

312
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,840
a case to be made that that is a misplaced amount of trust, but I want to back up a little

313
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,000
bit because way I open it. So there's not a great solution either way. And you've recently,

314
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,480
well not recently, but a little while ago you switched from the iPhone to Android. Absolutely.

315
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,280
Yep. And as far as a system functionality level goes, that's, I mean, to you, it must've

316
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,760
seemed like a pretty big upgrade. It was a, it was a huge upgrade. And my motivation,

317
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,200
honestly, I, for a long time, cause I've, you know, you want to go back far enough.

318
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,360
I was on very early versions of a windows mobile, then of course later on blackberry

319
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,120
and so on and so forth. And then I tried this whole iPhone thing and it was just a total

320
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,240
wake up call, especially with, from the browser and all this sort of stuff and being free

321
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,040
of a keyboard. It was a, it was a great experience for what it was. iPhone one, iPhone two, three

322
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,080
and 3G. And then at the, by the time 3G rolled around, I was kind of like, yeah, I'm kind

323
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,320
of done. And, you know, my wife went for, and I actually went with an Android phone

324
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,400
and it was just like someone pulled the, like pulled a kidnapper's hood off my face when

325
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,360
I tried the Android. It's like, oh my God, there's widgets and control and I can make

326
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,040
adult decisions with my phone. Holy crap. It's like, I felt like, there's a file system

327
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:37,280
in here. It appealed to someone that wanted to really play, you know, with the underpinnings

328
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,920
of their phone a little more as you want to, you know, root it or whatever to get that

329
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,220
functionality with an iPhone, I would have to actually jailbreak it. And I never wanted

330
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,760
to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, I've been looking at it

331
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,420
from the standpoint of a privacy aspect and I, I think, I think the iPhone has a better

332
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:59,600
argument here. Um, I, I feel like there and it comes down to kind of almost like a fundamental

333
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:06,100
corporate philosophy. I feel like Android is sold to, so the goal of selling Android

334
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,960
and this is why Google literally gives it away, right? Is because they really want to

335
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,020
eventually sell Google services. That is true. And, and arguably people would point out that

336
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:21,320
Apple is not motivated in doing that right now. I would counter with bull jobs. Steve

337
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,800
Jobs has passed on. Cook is absolutely going to keep that company competitive. And in order

338
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,320
to do that in the coming years, you damn well better believe they're going to mimic Google's

339
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,560
model. It will happen. I, but here's the difference, right? So here's the difference is they're

340
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:40,360
making the iPhone and as a checkbox on that, on that box or on that spec sheet, they have

341
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,400
this companion iCloud service, right? Google is the cloud and they make Android to connect

342
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:53,480
you to it. So Apple is making the iPhone to sell you a overpriced piece of hardware. Google

343
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,300
is making Android to sell you their cloud services. But the problem here is those cloud

344
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:04,460
services rely on extracting as much information about you as possible, logging that information.

345
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,360
And because they are a US held company, this is where the NSA paranoia comes in. Anything

346
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:14,400
they learn about you is subpoenable by the FBI, whoever needs to get it right. So arguably

347
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,480
Apple is not a threat in that regard yet. You know, I think even as they begin to roll,

348
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,760
ramp out more and more of those features, it still comes down to a, the basic alignment

349
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,060
of the priorities of the company. Apple is a hardware manufacturer. They live and die

350
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,960
on making that hardware. All of their margins are on hardware. They give away all of the

351
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,700
software because they don't make any money on it. We're talking about a company that

352
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,520
makes billions and billions and billions, hundreds of billions even on selling little

353
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,680
gadgets. Google makes its billions on selling advertising. That's a hundred percent accurate.

354
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,420
No, absolutely true. But I would also point to the evolution of, and I hate to keep bouncing

355
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,920
back to Apple, but it's part of the conversation. Apple computers wasn't always just Apple.

356
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,400
It used to be Apple computers. And they evolved. They had to change their model. They were

357
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,880
no longer just about selling, you know, selling an Apple computer. They were moving into complete

358
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,480
and more of a, I would argue, more of a services based experience, whether it be iTunes or

359
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,160
I this or I that or whatever. And I think the iCloud stuff, and I think that over time

360
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,440
we're going to see them, I would even say probably within, no later than two years from

361
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,160
now become on par with what Google's doing.

362
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,640
So, you know, I think you might be right.

363
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,840
So if you lock yourself into that ecosystem, yeah, you buy yourself a little time, but,

364
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,240
but are they truly going to, do you trust Jim, you know, do you trust Cook enough that

365
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,000
you're going to believe that he's going to tell you, Hey, by the way, we're changing

366
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,920
everything around and we're going to start doing this, this stuff behind the scenes?

367
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Probably not.

368
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,520
I think, I think it might be a heretic in this room, but I think I trust Tim Cook more

369
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,000
than I trust the Google boys. I really do. And like, I'll give, I'll give you an example.

370
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,040
Let's just say all of this information that Google is collecting on us never is used against

371
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,900
us. It's never leaked. It's never, it's never given to the authorities. It's never used

372
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,000
to build a creepy database about knowing what you want before you notice. It's never anything

373
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
like that.

374
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,800
What happens when the next regime comes in and they have all of that data, they have

375
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,440
access to all of that information. They have all of that there. It's going to get twisted.

376
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,700
And you know, the other thing that I want to get, I want to just mention before it leaves

377
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:18,100
the chat log is you queue in the chair and GQ says Android is open source and iMessage

378
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,520
is backdoored. Well, how do we know that? Because what we actually have documented is

379
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,800
that iMessage creates an, it has a key on both ends and the messages are encrypted between

380
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,240
the two parties. That's what we know about iMessage. What we know about Hangouts with

381
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,240
the comparable on Android is we know everything on Hangouts goes through Google and is logged

382
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,400
by Google. That's what we know. Those are the things we know there. And you can't call

383
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,240
Google open because it's completely locked down by the carriers, right? And the other

384
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,920
thing is when you say the iPhone is more locked down, everybody's always talking about the

385
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,440
app store, right? Oh, well the iOS app store is super locked down. Well, you know what?

386
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,120
I'm the jackass that just got a crap ton of spyware on his Android device because I installed

387
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,940
a $5 Star Trek application, right? So maybe that is a little reasonable on a phone that's

388
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,460
meant so I can call my wife to see how the kids are doing. Maybe that is partially reasonable.

389
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:07,200
But also, if the measuring stick for what makes a platform open or closed is how you

390
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,720
load apps, if you can sideload apps or not, or who gets into the Android app store, then

391
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,460
let's talk about Ubuntu Touch and Firefox OS because those would also be considered

392
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:20,560
locked down because they don't even have an app store. There is open as Safari is on iOS

393
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,480
or Chrome is on Android, right? HTML5, baby. It's an HTML5 app. That's open. There's your

394
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
openness.

395
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,440
I think that's really where the focus needs to be is less about Apple, less about if Android

396
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,940
is a concern for folks. And believe me, I get it. I understand that. I just don't buy

397
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,480
into that Apple is going to be wholesome for two years down the road. I think that's crap.

398
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:43,220
I think at some point, just if they want to be competitive and get onto that whole database

399
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,040
tit that everybody's making all the money on, I think they're going to have to jump

400
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,560
on at some point. But for now, they're not. I get that. But I think the HTML5 stuff, I

401
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,480
think that's where people need to be looking. I think you're spot on with that.

402
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
Absolutely.

403
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,320
Again, I'm not throwing my HTC One in the garbage, but I just want to throw a few things

404
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,840
back to people and just get them to think about this a little more because I look at

405
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,320
like trying to move away from Google now and I think about, in a lot of ways, I'm kind

406
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,480
of locked in here. I've got my contacts syncing through Google. I've got my calendar syncing

407
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,140
through Google. All of these cloud services in a form are a type of data lock-in.

408
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,160
And even if you go to Data Liberation, whatever the hell it is that Google offers, they still

409
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,320
retain that information. So that's legitimate as well.

410
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,240
Well, then you think what? Then you get it in like some big old file and it's just a

411
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
pain in the butt.

412
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,680
Right. And you've got to deal with it. Yeah. I hear you.

413
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,080
I just wanted to put the brakes on everybody and say, okay, think about this a little bit

414
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,800
because I had an iPhone over the weekend playing with iOS 7 to talk about it on Koda Radio

415
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:44,080
on Monday. I actually thought it performed better than any Android device I've used.

416
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:53,920
I hadn't used iMessage before. I think iMessage is great. I actually thought it was a fantastic

417
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,960
user experience. I thought the battery life was way better than I expected. I couldn't

418
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,720
believe how good the battery life was. And to be honest with you, when I'm looking at

419
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,880
the two, I don't think you can really be mad at anybody for choosing one platform over

420
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,960
the other because I think they both have this long list of disadvantages.

421
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,040
Sure. And in my household, as in yours, we run all of them. So I totally get you. No,

422
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,960
I think for me, it's that I look at iOS 7 and it's like, oh, look, I should put on my

423
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:28,840
Stussy t-shirt and get my TNC surf shop gear because I'm looking at fricking this neon mess.

424
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,520
It kind of does have elements of iOS Vista. It's like they're Vista of iOS a little bit.

425
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,160
So if I wear sunglasses, I can enjoy the performance. I mean, it's just, it's, you know, we just

426
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,880
wait. That's going to make it everywhere else. You just wait. I know it is. And then, and

427
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,680
then all the Linux distros are going to start mimicking. I know. Oh man. That's going to

428
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:50,520
be awful. All right. I'm harsh on it. I'm harsh on it. I want to see a mumble room.

429
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,640
You guys have been quiet. I know this is something we kick around on the pre-show. What do you

430
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:59,200
guys think? Am I just off my rocker here? Am I, am I, am I losing it? That was to you

431
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,960
mumble room. Definitely not losing it at all. Like I said in a previous one, they do lock

432
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:10,680
you down with the ecosystem. Both sides though, right? You get locked into play area. I experienced

433
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:18,120
that now. It's a necessary evil in many ways. That's interesting. It's like using gasoline.

434
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,520
At the end of the day, you have to choose what's best for you and your condition, your

435
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,240
situation. You can't have ideology around very critical aspects of your life. Yes. If

436
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,920
you believe Android is better for certain reasons, you use that. But if iOS offers you

437
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,720
something that you absolutely need, you can't just abandon it. You can't just ignore it

438
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,240
because you believe in something. So I think you have to choose what's best for you at

439
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,240
the end of the day. At the end, you know. That's rational. Yeah. Very rational point.

440
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:56,320
I actually have a specific analogy that I use to describe an Apple product. It's akin

441
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,680
to having a steak in your front yard and your chain to the steak on your front yard. And

442
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:08,240
within this radius, you are happy. But if you ever want to get out of this radius, you

443
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:14,400
will never, ever get out of this bubble. But in it, it's pretty. As soon as you ever want

444
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,320
to go, you're screwed. Yeah. OK. I mean, I think but I feel like they both even like

445
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,220
Blackberry does that to an extent. But what about my what about my issues around as a

446
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,960
Linux user? I'm a little incensed that they're taking my baby and they're making it a whore,

447
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,240
a two dime whore at that a two bit whore. I mean, do you get my way off on that? What

448
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,720
do you guys think? Apache allows anything. But if we were going to get upset about what

449
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,920
Tivo did, how come we're not upset about what this what's happening here? Because I think

450
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,260
we're being I think Android and any any I won't even say Android, I think any passionate

451
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:54,200
mobile operating system experience that we're passionate about spoon feeds us B.S. and sunshine

452
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,520
to a point where we're fat, dumb and happy. And so regardless of what mobile platform

453
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,400
you're in, if it involves an app store and some level of vendor lock in, you're so into

454
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,220
that because you're enjoying the experience. You're really not interested or even that

455
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:11,760
concerned about the negative side of it. I know I fall into that category. I'm I'm aware

456
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,080
of it because I like to be educated. I just can't get myself to care enough to do anything

457
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,440
about it. That's a terrible thing to say, but it's true. That's why I'm I'm happy with

458
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,800
Android, despite knowing the fact that I've been indexed and doing decimal system by Google.

459
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:30,120
I don't know. I almost feel like the rational thing to do when I when I sort of weigh all

460
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,720
the pros and cons, I go into more depth on quarter radios, I kind of feel like jump off

461
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,840
Android and wait for a couple of years for Firefox OS to get rockin. And, you know, wait

462
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,600
for it to get a good messaging application, wait for it to get WebRTC integrated, wait

463
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,840
for, you know, some kind of ecosystem to build up around it and then get a Firefox OS phone

464
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,640
and then just be like, OK, I'm going to I'm going to live here. Or I'm going to. Yeah,

465
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,680
in the meantime, civilization is important because a lot of TVs and embedded devices

466
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:03,120
run Linux, whether we know or not, it's allowed the use of many like it to spread to many

467
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:08,280
factors of our life without us even knowing our cars. It would never be able to be put

468
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,840
in a what is that new electric awesome car there? Yeah, Tesla. Yeah, the Tesla. We'd

469
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,560
never have the Tesla running Linux if it wasn't too visible. Right. You see the Tivo

470
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:26,600
issue. Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. The Tivo issue is also Tivo never acknowledges Linux

471
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,360
is there, whereas Google does actually acknowledge it, but just they don't market it. Yeah, but

472
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:37,320
remember, I mean, remember what just happened with the Chromecast. I mean, that that's disappointing.

473
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,840
That is not encouraging when it's just basically a bare Linux installation. I think it might

474
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:47,880
have been a Buntu based or Google to base with a binary named Chromecast running or

475
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,360
Gentoo. That's what it was Gentoo with a binary running. That's the Chromecast app.

476
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,440
It was a Linux box. It's a Linux device. Why not promote that to make? I mean, because

477
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,200
if they base their style, their stack on Linux, then doesn't it benefit them to show how Linux

478
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,160
can be used in like all of these different use cases? Like, it seems like it's not just

479
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,440
good for Linux, but it's good for them to not from a marketing perspective. If I'm not

480
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,880
mistaken, it's a yeah, it is a marketing thing, right? The Chrome, the Chrome ideology that's

481
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,640
easy to use. So if they call it a Chromecast, not like a Linux cast, it then sounds like

482
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,240
it's this easy to use thing that sort of relates to the web. And so it relates to the Chrome

483
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,480
streaming thing because a lot of what they do is they stream from the Chrome browser

484
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,880
to that device. So they want to make it sound like the two products are linked is sort of

485
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
my understanding.

486
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,240
Yeah, right. Okay. From like a, okay, okay. Yeah. From like a, oh, I know what that is

487
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,240
kind of standpoint.

488
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,200
Well, to give you an example, I work for a company that recently went through a name

489
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,480
change and of course the original name, no one ever heard of, but the brand name, people

490
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,400
are well aware of it. And you know, we don't, all the branding efforts go into the flagship

491
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,080
product name and the flagship brand name versus the tech, the underlying technology behind

492
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,680
it, because honestly no one cares. Geeks might care, but Joe user doesn't give a flying rip.

493
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,960
Yeah. I mean, a lot of windows users, you ask them, well, what version of windows you

494
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,600
have? I don't know. I got the one that came on my computer. They don't have a clue. I

495
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,480
have an HP or I have a Dell. You know, that's, that's the brand that they've been taught

496
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,200
to associate with. So I think that's the same thing with Google.

497
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,000
And there's still, there's still that, that, you know, mindset that, oh, it runs Linux.

498
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,520
Oh, it's, it's, you know, you know, just for hackers, it's just for command line and all

499
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:30,160
this other stuff. And which is obviously wrong, but yeah, you get a windows power user aware

500
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,560
of it and then they're start spreading thought everywhere. Absolutely.

501
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Yeah.

502
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,560
Thing is, the thing about open source is that you don't actually have control over what

503
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,280
somebody else does with it. If Rome disagrees with what Cinnamon is doing, they can stop

504
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:48,420
it. If Ubuntu disagrees with what elementary OS is doing, they have no say in it. So similarly,

505
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:54,240
if somebody takes a Linux kernel under the, under legal licenses or whatever, and does

506
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,480
whatever to it, nobody else has a choice to, nobody else can stop it because it's open

507
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:04,760
source. They have the option to modify it and use it as they see fit, you know.

508
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,760
I agree.

509
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,840
Okay. Let me give you another aspect of, of Android that's bothering me. And I've mentioned

510
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,520
this before on previous shows, but it goes back to the original getting into the carriers.

511
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:21,160
So let's hit the, let's hit the way back machine. Back when Jobs was still kicking it at Apple

512
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:27,400
and in full evil Jobs force, he went around to every single carrier, starting with Verizon

513
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,400
and said, here's our product. We'd like to sell it on your wireless network. And then

514
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,380
as soon as the conversation got too great, we'd like to preload our applications and

515
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,240
do things like carrier IQ. Does everybody in the chat room who's giving me a hard time

516
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,300
about iOS being a spy device, does everybody remember carrier IQ? Because that got loaded

517
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,440
up on our free phones and that was a nightmare. If you don't know what carrier IQ is, go

518
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,140
Google that because your device probably still has it. So, so Apple said, no, go screw yourself.

519
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,700
And they walked and they ended up going to the smallest wireless carrier in America.

520
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,880
And that was singular. They were the small fry that everybody thought was a joke. And

521
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,420
they were the only ones willing to take Apple up on their offer. And then we all know what

522
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,600
happened to singular. They blew up and they became AT&T. And now to this day, Apple rolls

523
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,400
into Verizon store and it's not shitted up with a bunch of Verizon apps. And when they

524
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,760
roll into sprint, you don't get your sprint sports cast broadcasted to your iPhone, right?

525
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,400
They still to this day say, go, go F yourself. And even in China, they just blew off a deal

526
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,680
with the biggest manual with the biggest wireless carrier in China because they wanted to load

527
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,680
it up with some crap. And Google has never, never had the balls to do that. In fact, Google

528
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:37,980
sells it on the exact opposite, just like Ubuntu touch is going to. They sell it on

529
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,320
shit it up all you want. And in fact, shit it up so bad, you can never get an update

530
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:46,360
ever. You can have the top of the line number one Android phone, best built phone ever still

531
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,800
being sold as a top of line phone and it will never get an update. We don't care. And that

532
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,460
is a complete FU to the users. That is an FU that is disregarding every lesson we have

533
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,240
learned about internet security, about software update, about platform maintenance and about

534
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,240
being a good steward of a platform and pushing it forward so that way developers can take

535
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,480
advantage of new features. They forfeited all of it just for market share because they

536
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,840
want the information. And at the end of the day, that really upsets me. Oh yeah, no, I

537
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,280
can understand being upset by it, but I think you got to understand the motivation behind

538
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,280
it. Apple's motivation for doing that is not to benefit the user. It is because they're

539
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,440
purist and they want it to have it their way and that's how they've always been. Think

540
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,000
different. It's all about their approach. I agree, but doesn't that exactly line up

541
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,320
with a customer's needs? In this case, not always. I mean, it can lead them down routes.

542
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,240
No, it's definitely an important and it's an important thing that people need to know.

543
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,240
I think that's an important differential that when people are making the decision what phone

544
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,560
to get, they need to know this stuff. That's really important. I mean, basically, I feel

545
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,160
like every Android device sold in the store should have a big warning label on it that

546
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,080
says, warning in six months to a year. This will be a walking exploit in your pocket.

547
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,480
This will not get updates. This is a security flaw. If you want a good device that's updated,

548
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,520
please go to play.google.com and buy it there. Or check out CyanogenMod. I mean, every Android

549
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,200
box needs to have that disclaimer because when I bought my Android device, I assumed

550
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,760
I would at least get six months worth of updates. I got no idea. Maybe I will, maybe I won't,

551
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,240
but you know what? Tomorrow, every freaking iPhone user for the last three years is getting

552
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,640
iOS 7. And there's no reason Android can't do that.

553
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,640
Well, and I suspect that...

554
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,720
See, the thing about Apple is that they have the ability to tell the carriers to just bend

555
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,360
them to their will, unlike Google who has it the other way around.

556
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,640
That's crap. Google had that power. Google just didn't want to exercise it because they

557
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:33,440
wanted the market share. They could have stuck to it. But you know what the other thing was

558
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,560
is their product wasn't good enough. I mean, if we go back to the G1, let's be honest,

559
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,560
that was not good enough.

560
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,560
No, the G1 was garbage.

561
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,440
It wasn't really until the Droid, right, that Android really was usable. I mean, that's

562
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
when I switched.

563
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,200
I suppose so, yes.

564
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:48,280
So I mean, I feel like they torpedoed their users to compete with Apple.

565
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,320
Well, and I think part of the difference is too is that Google is interested in their

566
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,200
penetration into the market at all costs as much as possible. And that's their goal, market,

567
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,920
market, market, market, market, where Apple is ideology, ideology, ideology. And in this

568
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,280
particular case, it aligns with good user experience, and that's great. But I do agree

569
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:16,480
with the whole disclosure thing. I think that's important. But I think that we got lucky with

570
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,000
Apple in that it just happened to fall under our benefit. And maybe they're even smart

571
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
enough to realize that.

572
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,720
I don't know. I think what Apple, I think honestly what did it in a big part was Steve

573
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,960
Jobs wanted to be able to get everybody to push the latest features out. They wanted

574
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,360
essentially this update thing because when you look at it right now, it's something like

575
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:40,520
some ridiculous stat like distributor to the Android OS.

576
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,560
This is the problem, though. They could have. They could have in the light. They could have

577
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,320
structured the licensing the way Microsoft structures the Windows phone licensing where

578
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,280
they allow for some time. But it was within the contract that they have to meet a certain

579
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,840
window. And I think that would have been completely appropriate. And it's Microsoft learning from

580
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,920
twenty five plus years in the PC licensing business had to handle this. And the reason

581
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,880
why Apple wanted to have a pristine OS on there is that way they could push out the

582
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,320
updates. And the reason isn't just security because it probably isn't their primary motivator.

583
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,860
The reason is, is because they want developers to target the new features, which is a massive

584
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:17,280
train wreck on Android. And they're now beginning to fix it with the play API, which is, by

585
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,940
the way, completely closed source. So great. They're fixing this fragmentation problem

586
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,720
with more closed source software. Yay, Google, way to go.

587
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,200
So in the meantime, every every like it's like something like ninety five percent of

588
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:34,680
iPhones run the latest OS that gives developers this massive opportunity for creating brand

589
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,600
new feature rich applications that take advantage of everything these new OS is and phones can

590
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,640
do. That isn't that is not as optional on Android. And it is just yet another. It's

591
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,400
not so it's not just the security thing. It's the feature is the end user. And it's about

592
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,120
getting the investment out of my six hundred dollar device.

593
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,680
I would agree. I would even go so far as to say I suspect at some point you're going to

594
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:59,200
see toward individual hardware manufacturers a couple of class action lawsuits. I'd say

595
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:05,240
the odds are fairly reasonable in that regard, just because there's not there's a lot of

596
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,880
marketing promises that make it sound like this is going to constantly be updated when

597
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,160
in fact that's not the case. That's for a court to decide. I don't know. But I suspect

598
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,200
that it's probably going to end up taking care of itself at some point because eventually

599
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,360
people will have enough and will have to make that decision of, wow, not buying that. I'm

600
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,020
not buying HTC again or I'm not buying Motorola again or whatever it may be. They're going

601
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:27,000
to have to make those choices, you know, based on those experiences must have, you know,

602
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,760
an update repository. So then future phones will fill this void of like security void.

603
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,400
They will eventually have repositories that you can say update the kernel or operating

604
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,720
system. But right now it's a void. That's up to Google if they want to do that or not.

605
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,120
Well, here's an interesting idea that dream dream points out, like if HTC one sold me

606
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:56,760
like this overall not warranty, but like if I could pay HTC $35 or whatever, kind of like,

607
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,720
you know, you go buy a new, you know, a new OS. If I could buy the new OS for my HTC one,

608
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,960
like I would buy it for a computer. Sure. I would do that. I would totally do that.

609
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,620
And I think that would actually be not an ideal solution, but it's totally what I would.

610
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,720
It's at least a workable solution. When I think squeaky wheel gets the grease. I think

611
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:20,720
if P if we, if people continue to educate non aware folks of this situation to where

612
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,120
they can then become noisy about it, then I think we might begin seeing these changes,

613
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,700
but I think that's the thing. The best thing we can do right now is to make people aware

614
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,600
of it. Not to say you should go one direction or the other, but to be like, Hey, by the

615
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:35,360
way, when you're buying your phone, are you asking these questions on, are you implementing

616
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,620
that into your decision? Cause I think that's an important thing to do, but you can have

617
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:42,680
company company a company B company C and they're all going to have different business

618
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:49,640
models. Um, the way that they're successful is, um, either they have great marketing and

619
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:55,380
or, um, their, their, uh, business plan or their, their direction aligns with customers

620
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,040
needs and wants, um, or they just have a fantastic product.

621
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:05,680
Right. It'll be nice as if Google in their contract, like with HTC and Samsung said after

622
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,240
a year, you know, you have to release X to the community so that way they can maintain

623
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:16,000
or something because no, well, no, I mean, I think a Cyanogen mod and Google play devices

624
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,880
and nexus devices are not a good enough answer because they only apply to the people that

625
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,820
are in our IRC and on this mumble server and listening to this podcast. They don't apply

626
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,120
to our, you know, to the immediate group outside the tech circle.

627
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:31,600
There is a solution to that though. Like, like with, for example, neck nexus devices

628
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,000
could, if they, the reason people don't buy nexus devices is because they're too expensive

629
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,260
and they're not even that expensive. They're like an extra 150, 100 maybe. But if you,

630
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:45,240
if they had a plan where you could buy the, the nexus devices from Google on a monthly

631
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,480
basis, just kind of like the jump plans or something like that, then a lot of people

632
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,960
would see that as a much better option. And then people would have phones that are not,

633
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,760
that are not like mine where it took 18 months to get an update.

634
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,520
Yes. However, I don't think Google can actually do that because that would require them to

635
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,620
sell the phone through the carrier and the carrier is not going to want them to not put

636
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,000
the carrier software on there.

637
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,520
It all comes back to that original deal. It all hinges on that.

638
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,800
That is why Google sells the phone separately. I'm convinced. And I think all of this goes

639
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,720
back to the evolution of the smartphone market. Apple with Steve Jobs took a risk by not selling

640
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,000
it to these carriers that wanted to put their crapware on it. And I think because he was

641
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
the, they were the first ones to the market that they had the ability to say no and not

642
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,480
just, you know, install the crapware and go for market penetration because they were there

643
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,160
pretty much first. They were able to do that and as soon as they rose to power, now they

644
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,880
have the market by the balls and they can say, well, Verizon, they're selling, you know,

645
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:49,440
the iPhone in massive quantities over at AT&T. If you want to sell it, you can't put your

646
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,620
crapware on it. And they sort of have Verizon by the balls now because they don't want customers

647
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,620
to go to AT&T.

648
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,080
Yeah, it took them like two to three years to get them on Verizon.

649
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,260
And so I think that's how they had the handle, whereas Google came late to the party just

650
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,960
like Ubuntu phone is. And now they really need to cater to the carrier so that they

651
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,440
can push their phone everywhere and try and gain market capitalization. Whereas Apple

652
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,440
already had this.

653
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,000
I mean, we see what Google had to do reflected in what Ubuntu touch has to do only magnified,

654
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,700
right? I mean, they have this massive carrier advisory group and they're literally pitching

655
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,680
it as carrier custom as a carrier customizable platform where you slot in your own services.

656
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,000
In fact, one of the quote unquote features is that you can put your own app store in

657
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,480
there. You can put your own, you know, media back into it.

658
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,840
That sounds worse than Google.

659
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:37,840
Yeah, exactly. It does. It does. It does. And I guess the thing is I have to ask myself

660
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:42,680
is if, if we're getting to the point where, uh, for some of us, like, you know, we could

661
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,840
get the nexus devices, you know, and we can get the signage and mods and we can make buy,

662
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:52,320
we can make do we're fortunate like that, but what do we do for everybody else? Like,

663
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,200
I mean, this is a problem where I feel like, I don't know, because I see an opportunity

664
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:03,200
for a business and or a, or a nonprofit foundation, one of the other, and it sounds like they're

665
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,920
trying to go back and retroactively fix this by making all of their Google applications

666
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,520
a separate package from the OS now.

667
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,520
Right.

668
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,480
And it sounds like, you know, they acknowledge that they kind of screwed up on the deal where

669
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:18,440
they let carriers and let vendors customize the phone OS and now they want to distribute

670
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,600
their apps separately and that controls most of the software functionality on the phone.

671
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,720
So now you can get updates to most of the core applications. Yeah. You still can't get

672
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,200
complete core OS updates. You can't get kernel updates necessarily, but at least you get

673
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,320
the Google apps.

674
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,080
And you get some security updates, but not necessarily all security. Yeah. It's not a

675
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,080
good, it's not a good solution.

676
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,540
At least you get the Chrome browser updates, right? I mean, I think that's probably one

677
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:45,280
of the most important things that they're going to be giving out with that.

678
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,240
But I think if enough geeks get passionate about this enough to where they want to come

679
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,440
together and they want to look at the more open source, you know, centric solutions,

680
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,880
like what you're talking about in our community, if that gets to be loud and scary enough and

681
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,960
enough people care, I think eventually you're going to see some entity catering to that

682
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
at some level.

683
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,160
It's not going to appeal to Joe average, but to, you know, to people, to geeks that do

684
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,600
care about these things, you know, I think it'll take care of itself.

685
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,400
So then why do we have, so all of this sounds completely reasonable. So then why do we have

686
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:19,760
things in our community like Ubuntu shame, iPhone shame? Why do we, why is there this,

687
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,360
why is there this lack of critical analysis on Google and, and why is there this sort

688
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:30,780
of pre pretty, um, assumption that, uh, you know, somebody must be an idiot if they're

689
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,880
using the iPhone, they must be because we're it's honestly, and pardon my French, but we're

690
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,720
fart sniffers, uh, geeks as a whole, you know, especially Android geeks and, and they are,

691
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,480
it's like, well, you know, clearly I'm, I know what I'm doing. You're an idiot. Um,

692
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,860
well clearly I, I see the benefits and the, and the functionality benefits of using the

693
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,880
platform I'm using and I'm, I'm, I'm their king in that regard. Cause I look at Android

694
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,240
and then I look at iPhone and I'm like, yeah, right. I can understand that. Yeah. And so

695
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,920
that I get in that mindset. And so I will be your representative, you know, tool bag

696
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,720
here and pointing out that I walk around looking at iPhone, yours is going, Oh God, why the

697
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,860
hell would you use that? Not really stopping to consider there are in fact some advantages

698
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:12,520
to it. And I'm, I'm definitely guilty of that. So I think that as a whole, as a community,

699
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:19,520
a lot of Android folks do fall into that, you know, but I did use an iPhone for a long

700
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,720
time so I can back it up and not just say, I'm just talking to Android. I, you know,

701
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,740
I used to, you know, I, I, I've been, I walked that path. It had its preferences in your

702
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:33,600
needs and you're going to use what fits your needs. Not because it's popular. I mean, I

703
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:38,800
know people go out and buy new phones because the new hotness, but it's, it's, it's, it's

704
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:44,040
what, it's what you need. And, and people as us as a community or not, maybe not us,

705
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,760
but people in general should really just stop hating on other people just for the sake of

706
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,600
hating out other people because they're using something different or look down on instead

707
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,480
of the grass is always greener. The grass is always Browner on the other side.

708
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,720
I think for geeks and our people in our community, I think that's absolutely true. I think for

709
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:06,400
Joe average, I would absolutely say 120% people buy the latest idiot thing on the television.

710
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,800
Just average people. I see it all the time with the young, my nephews, poster child.

711
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,160
Oh my God, you see that one phone? I don't even know what the hell it does, but God,

712
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,400
it looks great. I got to get it. You know, you got those types of folks as well.

713
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,400
Yeah.

714
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,960
Non tech savvy people purchasing new hardware that they, they don't really know what's,

715
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,960
what's going on.

716
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,960
You don't even need it.

717
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,960
Yeah.

718
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,000
Things like that. Or here, here does, here's something that, that doesn't really help,

719
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,400
the case is you have the marketing, the commercials that's that, what was it? I think it was one

720
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:39,080
of the Samsung's commercials that was showing like the old folks in line waiting for the

721
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,080
iPhone.

722
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,080
That was awesome.

723
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,080
Yeah.

724
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,080
Yeah.

725
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,760
And that, and that's kids pay attention to that. Believe me, they really do. You ask

726
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:51,080
my nephew, he's 16 years old. Would you want a brand new iPhone or would you want my used

727
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,320
note too? There is not even a conversation there. He wants the note too, because that's

728
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,200
what he's been told is awesome. He's been told the iPhone is something dinosaurs use.

729
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,200
Well, all right.

730
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,200
And it sucks, but you know.

731
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,440
As far as the geek community goes, I think there's a stigma attached with something popular

732
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:11,680
because I mean, what I'm saying is Ubuntu is popular. Apple, iOS is popular. That's

733
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,040
why we must hate it. We must always root for Luke Skywalker, the underdog.

734
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,800
That's true. Yeah. That's an interesting perspective. I'm considering that.

735
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,160
Yeah, perhaps. I think, I think I want to, you know, I think maybe for a future conversation,

736
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,560
I want to talk about how a lot of these open platforms ended up saving their data back

737
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:32,920
to closed source programs and platforms that are really generally meant for tracking users.

738
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,160
But I think that could be a conversation for a future episode.

739
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,160
Yeah.

740
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,080
All right guys. Well, good on you. Thanks for kicking that around. And I, you know,

741
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:46,200
I leave it, I leave it kind of buttoned up with, you know, I'm left with, I try to find

742
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:51,800
the Zen of the situation and tell myself that honestly the HTC One, which is running 4.1.2

743
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,000
has everything I need. Really. I mean, there's nothing like in the new updates that I have

744
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,800
to have and I'm, I'm trying to be careful. Although I did just get recently bit with,

745
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:05,440
with spyware crap, but I try to be careful and studious. And so it's not really functionally,

746
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,400
it's you know, if there, if there was something really confidential and secret that I didn't

747
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,840
want logged by Google, I'd probably just not put it on my phone.

748
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,560
Well, and as someone as myself, who is, I would say I'm reasonably new to Android, so

749
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:20,560
I can still be kind of a newbie in this regard. What's your view on things like lookout and,

750
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,560
and anti, you know, security software? Is it crap?

751
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,560
No, I mean, no, I mean, I've tried it. I had a,

752
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,560
Cause I have no idea. I mean like, this is all new to me.

753
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,320
No, I, I used one of those programs actually to clean it up. I had a, I have a program

754
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,200
on here that scans it and it went through and found and cleaned it up for me. So I mean,

755
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:41,360
they don't seem to be totally, totally a waste of it. It seems so ridiculous. I guess.

756
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,080
It is. Yeah. And that's what puts all the overhead on my old phone. You know, you were

757
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,520
talking about how it was slow. That's, that's where a lot of the overhead comes from is

758
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,680
running lookout. And I, and it's, it's seemed to have kept my phone. It actually caught

759
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,040
me from keeping a few things off my phone. As a matter of fact, I remember when I switched

760
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,800
cause I, I, I followed the same path that you followed. I even tried windows phone,

761
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:02,320
you know, like the old, I had an old HTC windows phone that was just like this ridiculous joke.

762
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,520
And so when the iPhone came, I was impressed and I got like the, I didn't buy the first

763
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,760
one cause I was like, no way I'm going to buy first gen Apple, anything. And I think

764
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,200
I got like the, the three GS. I can't remember. I got somewhere around in there and I remember

765
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,680
thinking it was pretty good and I waited until the droid came out on Verizon. And then when

766
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:23,600
the droid came out, I remember switching and thinking, God, this feels like an actual computer.

767
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:28,620
Like this is, this is like, you know, and that was my feeling. So I, Android fits my

768
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:34,920
user style. My, the style, I'm a, I'm a power user. Android fits that better. And I have

769
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,780
options out there like Cyanogen mod, you know, just like I can use encryption to, and I can

770
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:43,360
use bid message or whatever. Right? Like I have all these options. I just, I wish that

771
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,040
when we just stop at the end of the day, I wish we would just think more critically about

772
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:51,520
some of it. Well, and I'm holding out a lot of hope more and more for Firefox OS. I really

773
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,680
want to see this be the solution with a company behind it. That's going to keep the value.

774
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,960
Even if Firefox OS is great. You've got, you've got a couple of years of, oh, it's going to

775
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,440
be a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. You got a couple of years. But I'm holding out hope longterm.

776
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,200
I'm thinking long game here. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, I want to read a couple of emails

777
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,800
before we run. Peter wrote into the show. He says, hi Matt and Chris. I just backed

778
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:18,680
a zero AD on Indiegogo and then later had my credit card compromised by a payment made

779
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:22,760
to Samsung telecom in the US. That's pretty strange since I'm based out of the UK and

780
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:27,560
I've had no other US transactions except for Indiegogo. Who knows? He says, but by the

781
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:31,200
way, I also moved to mint 15 and the Chrome browser on all my machines. Steam was the

782
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,400
last thing holding me back from Linux. I don't think Linux games are cheap or gamers are

783
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,760
cheap going back to our conversation from a few episodes ago. In my case, I already

784
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:45,320
own most of the games. Yeah. And then of course when he moved over, he just downloaded them

785
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:49,520
on the Linux version. And what we kind of sussed out, I don't remember how we got to

786
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:54,920
the bottom of this. I think somebody wrote into the show. Steam, it's not just the survey.

787
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:00,540
So steam collects usage stats via that survey, but then also after you've played a game on

788
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:04,640
a certain operating system, after a certain amount of time, it also then logs you on that

789
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:10,840
operating system. So if you have a bunch of games that you bought on the Windows side,

790
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,280
all of those purchases are counted for Windows. And then when you move over to Linux, which

791
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,320
probably some people are doing, and you redownload them, it's not until you've played each one

792
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:22,240
of those games for a certain amount of time that they're still counted as a Linux user.

793
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,800
Oh, so that's a double whammy then. Okay. And then he had a question after being bit

794
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:30,940
by that credit card problem they had. He said, can you guys recommend what internet security

795
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:35,720
software I should be using on the now sinking windows platform? I used a combination of

796
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:40,960
McAfee and spy bot surgeon destroy. Thanks in advance, Peter. So is he asking about security

797
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:47,680
software for Linux or Linux? Uh, well, I would, I mean, not a good firewall. Yeah. So here's

798
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,400
what I would say. Don't run his route, which you, which you're not probably on a mint 15

799
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,000
and um, use really good passwords everywhere. Maybe use something like key pass or last

800
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,680
pass. My personal favorite don't execute random commands or random binaries or things

801
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,520
of that sort. I would say the most important security precaution you could take on Linux

802
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:10,680
is don't run random binaries, like Matt just said, and used a different password for every

803
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:15,180
website. Yeah. Yeah. That's really, Oh, and uh, don't, don't install Java. That would

804
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:19,080
be another, you know what? Yeah. Don't, don't, don't use Java unless you need to. Yeah. And

805
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,480
don't bother with the browser plugin if you don't need to. Right. Don't. Yeah. That's

806
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:29,120
a good one. Why not? Um, and, and then like in the chat, in the chat, keep your updates,

807
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,600
keep your, you know, stay current with the OS updates. And when mint 15 stops getting

808
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:36,640
updates, you know, just remember that on mint, you're going to do a full reload and you're

809
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,080
going to upgrade. You're not, there's not an upgrade path. You're going to load the

810
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,280
next version. But I mean, let's be honest. Sometimes it's good to start clean. If you're

811
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,040
really, really concerned about, you know, that's the elephant in the room of course

812
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,760
is people surf about content. If you're going to be one of those guys and really, I, as

813
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:54,280
a guy, yeah, I dealt with a lot of men, a lot of married men that came in begging for

814
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,920
help and I actually had a special program for them. It's called the live CD or the live

815
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:05,640
USB without writeable options. I'm telling you, what about like a porn VM? I never thought

816
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,860
about this. I just thought of a great business. Like totally just go all QVC with it. Right?

817
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:14,720
Like a porn VM that lives inside a true Crip volume, right? Okay. So I've come into, Oh,

818
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,640
are you busted again? He's all, Oh, now you can have another, here's the pitch. Now you

819
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:25,800
can have another computer in your computer and it's encrypted, right? Call it the porn

820
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:29,920
box and it's based on virtual box.

821
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:37,240
Oh my God. I'm on this. This is going to happen. This is the next moneymaker. I have no ethics.

822
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:42,400
Yeah, let's do it. All right. Distributed via bit torrent, right? Um, all right. Uh,

823
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,640
so I had it, let's see, I think I didn't, I have another one. I just accidentally closed

824
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:49,960
it. Um, Oh man, I'm a bad person. I'm a bad person. I just closed the other email. Sorry

825
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,640
about that. But I'll look for it. Okay. And I got off on a tangent. I got all excited,

826
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,440
talking about Peron. It gets me going. I didn't have a big message. It's here. So here's the

827
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,160
arch challenge. Follow up. This came from Carl and he says, hi Chris and Matt. I started

828
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,880
to watch the show about three months ago and I've been a fan ever since. I know I'm a bit

829
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:08,000
late to the arch challenge, but I wanted to mention it anyways. First, I should say that

830
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,120
the first Linux I installed was Slackware 2.0. Hmm. Okay. So that's, that's, that's

831
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:19,960
quite a while ago, but, Oh, this is where it takes this work. There's always a, but,

832
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:26,160
but after moving to Apple for a good 10 years, I forgot most of it. Uh, anyway, I saw the

833
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:30,560
episode with the arch challenge and I thought, yeah, I should give it a go. So I did install

834
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,120
of arch and when I first came out and got it started, I was a little disappointed when

835
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:38,480
I found out there wasn't an installer. Okay. Yeah. So I'm kind of, well, there isn't, there

836
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,160
isn't, I'll get into that. Should we have not, I mean, there isn't a separate ISO, but

837
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:47,660
yeah, not officially. I just, I didn't, when we did the arch challenge, I didn't mean for

838
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:52,200
somebody that to take the arch challenge that was at that level. Yeah, right. Because like,

839
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,800
if you didn't know that about arch, I didn't whether it was intended for you. So I'm impressed

840
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,360
that he went for it, especially after living on the Mac for 10 years. So good on, good

841
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:04,440
on you, Carl. So he goes on to say, I did the arch install and, um, after, after three

842
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:10,440
tries I succeeded and now I'm running arch. Uh, and he's sticking with it. The bad point

843
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,880
about this, and here's the downside he says to arch and, and actually I have found this

844
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,760
to be the major disadvantage to arch too. And I'm wondering if you agree, Matt, uh,

845
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,120
he says the bad point is now he can't go back to any of the distro because there's no match

846
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,120
for arch.

847
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:27,800
Uh, you know, I would say that for, it depends on the person. For me, I dual booted arch

848
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,320
and Manjaro for a long time. And just because I wanted to really understand what that was

849
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:36,520
going to be like. Yeah. From a meta standpoint, I consider arch, Manjaro, Linux, all that

850
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:40,400
to kind of be the, yeah, I did, I did found some distinct, there's definitely some differences.

851
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,920
There's definitely some differences. I would absolutely say Manjaro is totally not arch.

852
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,640
It just happens to share some similarities. Is that bit you now? Did that bite you in

853
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,640
the butt?

854
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:53,440
Um, honestly, no. I, you know, I, you know, with arch I just kind of, it's, I think it's

855
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,280
actually stolen the partition. It's hardly ever used it. But with Manjaro, it's like

856
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,560
all the stuff that I was reading that was negative or they screwed this up or screwed

857
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,240
that up. As long as you're on the mailing list and you pay attention, you know, I mean,

858
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:07,280
and they, and, and yes, it is officially they say it's arch, but there's some, they use

859
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,760
their own repos. There's a lot of things that they do do completely differently. Age software,

860
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,160
that sort of thing. But it's kind of like for it's, you know, like it's arch for people

861
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:20,420
don't care, care about security. I would say it's for people that don't really aren't paranoid

862
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:23,920
about security. I'd say it's a more accurate statement. Yes, it's, it's often a month or

863
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,400
two older, but I've probably still fresher than a lot of distros. And on all these horror

864
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,560
stories I've read are generally, there's never anything to really back up an actual use case

865
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:38,040
scenario. So based on my own usage, I would say that arch is awesome. And if you want

866
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:42,400
to go that route, go that. But as far as men, Gerald being scary, a bullshit, I'm sorry.

867
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,280
It's just that I, you know, I look at it, I have a single problem with it. Oh, neither

868
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,280
with arch either.

869
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,240
So you and I have been, um, um, you and I off, off, uh, off camera and talked a little

870
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:57,320
bit recently about preparing for the Ubuntu 1310 review. Yeah. And the problem I have

871
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:02,640
with it is, uh, now I got a good way to do this because I've got on the bonobos, I've

872
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:08,200
got USB three and I got a, um, I got a USB three, a one terabyte drive. And it's one

873
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:13,720
of those hybrid drives that has SSD and, and, and then the, so it's, it's pretty fast and

874
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:18,320
I'll load Ubuntu on that. And you know, I'll, I'll be fine. I'm not looking forward to it

875
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:22,080
at all. And not because, I mean, honestly, I remember I used to run it. That was my previous

876
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:25,880
distro, but what it really is for me. And I know I've said this a lot and it's so funny

877
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:31,700
because it's what I was like, what's a, you are, that's what I was like, you are no dude.

878
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:36,800
It's all about the AUR. It's all about it because at the end of the day, Katie is Katie.

879
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,520
Gnome is gnome. It doesn't matter what, you know, you put, you put your theme on it. You

880
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,920
set your background, you load your favorite apps. They're all the same. Yeah. But the

881
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,360
AUR buddy, I mean like, you know, that was, that was it for it for me. And that's what,

882
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,080
you know, let's say Majuro disappears tomorrow. That's not a big deal. I still got the arch

883
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:55,280
installs roll back to it. No biggie that for me, it was the AUR experience that I cared

884
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:00,320
about. I, the, the arch way is awesome. I just don't care. Um, you know, what I cared

885
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:04,960
about was the, you know, the arch user repository. That's what sold me on the experience in general,

886
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,600
whether it be whatever it is, you know, what, whatever the distro is that happens to embrace

887
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:13,480
that as seamlessly. Hey Matt. Yeah. Uh, president Obama's here. He, hello everybody. Uh, he

888
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,800
wanted me to make a point that, uh, he wanted me to mention that Gentoo is awesome and the

889
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:24,480
Gentoo is incredible. Um, there we have fulfilled our duty. If our president says that it's

890
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,800
awesome and clearly, you know, I guess Obama's, I guess Obama's a big Gentoo user. Who knew

891
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,120
you'd think he'd be busier than that. You thought he was an apple guy, but you know,

892
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:36,240
this is good to know. Uh, he also says, by the way, he's loving the new show. And, uh,

893
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:40,600
he also just wanted to point out that he liked the Star Trek segment. Oh, no kidding. Oh,

894
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:44,280
he's a Star Trek fan. We got a Star Trek fan. We got a Star Trek fan. And he said that in

895
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,760
Carl, something to be a bit message. Uh, and we have the bit message address in the Linux

896
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,880
action show show notes. Um, I'm going to just, uh, mumble room, just one quick, uh, shout

897
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,700
to you guys. If there's anything you guys want to touch on, if anybody had last thing

898
01:04:55,700 --> 01:05:00,400
on the tip of their tongue before we run, uh, now is your chance. I wanted to say was,

899
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:07,160
uh, why can't system 76 just make phones and put whatever we want on it. I'm saying, I'm

900
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:15,600
thinking more like a tablet. I think a tablet, it would be awesome. Tablet. Yeah. You know,

901
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:20,080
I'm kind of, there would be a use for Nome three and Ubuntu and unity and all that. I,

902
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:23,400
I, you know, one of the things, one of the things we got a little, a little, a little

903
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,240
S for last week, Matt was, we talked about that. Remember that block phone where like

904
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:33,840
each thing, that's where I'm, that's where that with Firefox OS. Oh yeah. I mean, I

905
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,520
have to be honest. I mean, I, I acknowledge that's pretty unpractical that that thing's

906
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,960
going to ship. And even when it did ship, like it might not really work out really that

907
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,720
well, but I love to just think about that in a different way. And when you think about

908
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:51,400
a hardware platform like that, I mean, one of the things that really makes me sad about

909
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:56,160
is apparently a self fulfilling prophecy of the post PC era because PC manufacturers can't

910
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,160
figure out how to make computers. People want to actually spend their money on. I love the

911
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:03,560
idea that we all pretend like we haven't just had this global economic meltdown and that

912
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,880
nobody's got as much money as they used to have. And that everybody in the, in, at least

913
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,680
in the middle class that is the, is the bulk of people who buy these machines is struggling.

914
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,840
But let's all pretend like instead it's tablets that's causing the sales to drop down right

915
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,760
now. It's the fact that everybody's money is a little more precious and I'm not going

916
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,920
to spend it unless you give me something to pay for that I really, really want. It's more

917
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,040
about value. So instead they make these cheap tablets. That's fine. Whatever. I'm not going

918
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:29,960
to get all worked up about it. But what, what pains me about the loss of the PC is this

919
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:36,240
build it yourself if you want option and load any OS you want option. And I want that same

920
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,040
and that's what I loved about the block phone, right? I mean, even if it doesn't happen,

921
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:45,920
I love that it was just making us think about a future where that kind of possibility existed

922
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,000
where you have the choice of deciding not only what hardware is going to go into it,

923
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,200
but also what operating system and what software you're going to plug into it to where you,

924
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:56,720
if you, if something screws up, it was your fault because you did it. Right? That's awesome.

925
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:01,760
Democracy of a phone. Yeah, exactly. Right. Exactly. Yeah. I have a question. How is it

926
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,720
going to be different than how is it now? Because you still, I mean, if it's a lot easier

927
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:13,280
to install cyanogen or whatever on it, you still have a 95% users being windows and you

928
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:18,160
know, just like that, you still have a certain percentage being Android, certain percentage

929
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:23,400
being iOS. If you want to load another OS, you still have to do a lot of work. You have

930
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:28,280
to install it yourself. So we'd be back in the same position. If that's where other third

931
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:32,480
party companies will come in. That's what I'm thinking. Those little stores down the

932
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,680
road that would unlock your phone. It would say, do you want to try something else? We'll

933
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:42,600
do it for you overnight if you like, or in the next, whatever. Exactly. Well, I mean,

934
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:47,520
think about going back to system 76, you could have vendors like system 76 that take the

935
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:51,240
hardware and do the custom builder, do they take an OEM product and they create a solution

936
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:55,560
around it. And then they, they put the OS that that market wants, right? And then they

937
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,320
support it and they back it up and they build a whole business around it. You could have

938
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:05,560
that. So yes, I mean, so are you taking this to Danica then? There's a, here's a new business

939
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:12,560
idea. Yeah, I like that. Why would that, why hasn't that happened? I mean, that hasn't

940
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:17,080
happened on PCs yet. Why would that be more possible on the phone? Isn't, isn't aren't

941
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:23,160
companies like system 76 and za reason, um, examples of that happening? Yes. Right. But

942
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:28,080
they're not as popular. They're nowhere near as popular as they should be or could be.

943
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:32,920
Windows still controls the market. Linux is still 1%. I mean, windows Vista has more market

944
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:37,080
share. Well, I mean, it would shut us all up though, wouldn't it? We're going to have

945
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:41,420
to be moaning about this. We just move over to a system 76 or there's actually something

946
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:47,520
out now called the open moco device. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, I, I, I think some

947
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:52,080
of this, I mean, we got to scratch our Gabe beards here for a second and look at his conference

948
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:56,280
keynote that he just gave that we're going to talk about more on Sunday. Uh, you know,

949
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,640
he says the Linux is the future of gaming. I don't, I mean, who knows if he's right,

950
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:05,200
but I've been saying now for a while that as Microsoft just continues to screw it up

951
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,680
real bad and they're going to just keep screwing it up because they have to, because that's

952
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,760
the direction they got to move in. And you just wait for Apple, man. They are going to

953
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,760
bone the Mac desktop like nobody's business. You just wait till the iOS, that thing put

954
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:20,780
arm in it, in, in their machines. Everybody's going to need everybody who needs a truck

955
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:26,440
is going to have to bail and good old Linux is going to be there with system D and Wayland

956
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:33,760
and great video drivers and steam and hopefully a desktop that is usable. And I really think

957
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:40,380
that while these are today's problems, these might be solved in 2015, 2016 and beginning

958
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:46,340
to be solved in 2014. Are they already starting to be so exactly how I said that everything

959
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:52,240
is going to be, you know, thin client remote that like remote processing of everything

960
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:59,220
and only thin clients will eventually do that and screw us. And that's what Chrome and OS

961
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:02,320
is going to be. And that's what Android is going to be. That's their, that's their value

962
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:09,040
card. Yes. Yeah. I think everyone should have a little nasi in the corner. All cryptography's

963
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:15,760
math is correct. The implementations, sometimes buggy, but the math of crypto is correct.

964
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,880
Don't worry about being tin foil hatty about it.

965
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:24,200
So I leave us on that point. I mean, like, uh, we have some today problems with Android

966
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:29,940
that really bother me. Um, and, and I'm not actually sure that we've even scratched the

967
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:34,800
surface of this conversation around Google, Android, cloud services, monitoring and all

968
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:40,560
of that. But I think what we do see is solutions that are being created, right? We see solutions

969
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,700
in the PC industry that might actually end up being a lot of people's salvation. And

970
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:50,920
we might eventually with things like sailfish and fire Fox OS, I think we'll see solutions

971
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:55,560
there too. And you know, we'll just talk about them as they come up. But as of right now,

972
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:00,320
I don't begrudge anybody for going out on Friday and buying themselves an iPhone. I

973
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:04,400
say good on you. I'll be happy with my HTC one. I'm going to stick with it for at least

974
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,000
now. I don't know. I could see you hanging out in a, hanging out in a car somewhere with

975
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,880
a hoodie and sunglasses and a baseball bat watching for folks at the Verizon store. Yeah,

976
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:17,600
yeah, yeah. I could see that too. All right. Mumble room. Well, thanks you guys for joining

977
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,320
us. Hey, uh, you guys in the download audience, if you want to join us live, you can, uh,

978
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:28,200
we do this on, uh, Tuesdays over at jblive.tv at, uh, 2 p.m. Pacific, which, uh, I believe

979
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:33,160
clocks in at like 9 p.m. UTC. If you want to join us over at jblive.tv or jblive.info,

980
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,560
we have a mumble server, which you can participate in, or we have an IRC chat room and, uh, we

981
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,320
watch that too. And then we also have a little, a pre and post show that, uh, is pretty great.

982
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,680
And don't forget to tune into this Sunday's Linux action show. We've got a big show coming

983
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:49,260
up. I am going to talk a little bit about, uh, there's a topic that's been coming up

984
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:53,880
and up and up and over and over again is this building the personal cloud, right? Building

985
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:58,080
your own cloud on your land because that's really the most secure, but it's not just

986
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:02,320
about security. It's also about reliability, performance, and it's about being able to,

987
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:08,000
for example, my house could be a, my house is a big Netflix house, but Netflix doesn't

988
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,240
run so good on the Linux. So we've been moving that in the house. If there's a series of

989
