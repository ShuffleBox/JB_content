00:00.000 --> 00:10.180
A really big happy birthday to VLC, the Videolan, champion of open source, reached 20 years

00:10.180 --> 00:11.180
old.

00:11.180 --> 00:13.100
That's really all we have to say.

00:13.100 --> 00:17.820
Happy birthday to VLC.

00:17.820 --> 00:25.300
The project was released to the world on February 1st, 2001, and I've had that traffic cone

00:25.300 --> 00:27.860
on my desktop ever since.

00:27.860 --> 00:30.920
And sometimes it's Christmas and it gets a cute little hat.

00:30.920 --> 00:31.920
I do love that.

00:31.920 --> 00:32.920
I do love that.

00:32.920 --> 00:37.000
So really, we're kind of laughing and joking, but we have a lot of appreciation for good

00:37.000 --> 00:45.720
old VLC.

00:45.720 --> 00:49.040
Hello friends and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.040
My name is Chris.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.040
My name is Wes.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.720
Hello, Wes.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.000
Thanks for bringing in the slow cooker to the studio today.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.380
That's going to be delicious.

00:56.380 --> 00:59.760
And this episode is brought to you by the all new, a cloud guru, the leader in learning

00:59.760 --> 01:03.660
for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills, hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on

01:03.660 --> 01:07.580
labs, get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru.com.

01:07.580 --> 01:15.860
So here we are gathered together today on episode 391, and we have some really interesting

01:15.860 --> 01:19.980
big community news that actually impacts our local community as well this week that we're

01:19.980 --> 01:21.580
going to get into.

01:21.580 --> 01:28.920
And then later in the show, we've spent some time on Gnome Shell 40, and there is a lot

01:28.920 --> 01:30.480
to talk about here.

01:30.480 --> 01:35.100
And maybe something you should be aware of, especially if you're a multi-monitor user,

01:35.100 --> 01:37.480
we're going to get into that a little bit into the show.

01:37.480 --> 01:41.760
We got some pics, we got some feedback, but we really do have some great community news

01:41.760 --> 01:42.760
to get through.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.400
So I want to start by saying holler over at our virtual log, time appropriate greetings

01:46.400 --> 01:47.400
mumble room.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.400
Hello Chris.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.400
Hello.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.400
Howdy.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.400
Hello.

01:51.400 --> 01:58.380
So last week we recorded early, and we still showed up and hung out live on the stream,

01:58.380 --> 02:02.100
and that's up on our PeerTube instance over at Jupiter.Tube.

02:02.100 --> 02:05.960
If you want to see that, I don't know, I'm just experimenting.

02:05.960 --> 02:10.880
And people still show up, even if we're pre-recorded, they don't know, they still show up.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.280
So we figured we'll be there.

02:12.280 --> 02:16.820
And we just did a little hangout, it was great, and that's up on Jupiter.Tube if you'd like

02:16.820 --> 02:17.820
to see it.

02:17.820 --> 02:22.800
So let's get into changes coming to Ubuntu, and some of them are quite significant.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.380
We'll start though with the refreshed Ubuntu installer.

02:26.380 --> 02:31.560
It's a new installer, and it's looking quite different than what we're familiar with.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.760
With the key takeaway being that it's built with Flutter.

02:35.760 --> 02:41.200
That is of course a project that Google works on, and Canonical and Google work together

02:41.200 --> 02:45.600
to bring Flutter to the Linux desktop as a snap.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.720
Wimpey writes on the development discourse that the development process for the new desktop

02:50.720 --> 02:55.400
installer is being led by the Canonical design team and the Ubuntu desktop team.

02:55.400 --> 02:59.480
Both teams have a wealth of experience navigating the challenges presented when installing a

02:59.480 --> 03:01.600
modern operating system.

03:01.600 --> 03:06.080
Don't worry though, the Ubiquiti installer will remain available in the Ubuntu archive

03:06.080 --> 03:11.400
for official flavors, remixes, or derivatives to continue using in their images.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.440
You don't have to change just right now.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.640
These timing couldn't be better because in the chat room right now returning to the show

03:16.640 --> 03:18.000
is Mr. Martin Wimperis.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Hello, Wimpey.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Hello, how are you?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Hello.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.400
So we have lots to talk about today, but why don't we start with this one?

03:24.400 --> 03:29.120
This seems like a big endeavor that the project's starting with, and I would imagine hoping

03:29.120 --> 03:30.760
to land before the next LTS.

03:30.760 --> 03:36.640
Yeah, that's the plan to land this in time for 2204, and in fact, land it in time for

03:36.640 --> 03:37.640
2110.

03:37.640 --> 03:44.320
For people that like to be on the cutting edge and something you can tinker with later

03:44.320 --> 03:46.560
in this 2104 cycle.

03:46.560 --> 03:52.940
Now is the intention that essentially main Ubuntu desktop will use this and then flavors

03:52.940 --> 03:56.680
like Ubuntu mate will use the traditional Ubiquiti installer?

03:56.680 --> 04:01.040
Yeah, I mean, we're not going to force people over to a new installer all at once, but we're

04:01.040 --> 04:06.960
definitely going to give them the opportunity to use the new stuff and get involved in that.

04:06.960 --> 04:10.680
Okay, so if they want to, they can, but the old one is essentially available.

04:10.680 --> 04:15.080
There's been thought to that in the development, or there will be anyway, to support all these

04:15.080 --> 04:16.080
other users.

04:16.080 --> 04:21.560
Indeed, and that initial announcement is not just sort of outlining broadly our intentions,

04:21.560 --> 04:26.920
but also a call for what's your feedback, how do you want to get involved?

04:26.920 --> 04:31.480
So if I'm an Ubuntu user, I should expect to see this not in this next release, but

04:31.480 --> 04:33.920
the one in October, the first version of this?

04:33.920 --> 04:34.920
Correct.

04:34.920 --> 04:38.360
We didn't just want to like throw it over the wall, you know, in a release.

04:38.360 --> 04:43.520
We wanted the opportunity for the community to get involved in a conversation and make

04:43.520 --> 04:46.100
sure that all of that's accounted for early on.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.320
What are your thoughts around the selection of Flutter?

04:48.320 --> 04:53.960
Well, I mean, it's no secret that we've been working with Google to enable Flutter for

04:53.960 --> 04:58.440
the Linux desktop, and we're not doing that for no good reason.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.200
You know, we're doing it for several reasons.

05:00.200 --> 05:06.080
One is it's the fastest growing developer community right now, and there's lots of momentum

05:06.080 --> 05:12.280
and interesting applications being developed in Flutter, and we want to invite those developers

05:12.280 --> 05:16.680
and software vendors to bring their applications to the Linux desktop.

05:16.680 --> 05:22.280
So that's sort of mission one, and mission two is we have a host of interesting projects

05:22.280 --> 05:27.400
that we want to work on internally, and they're not just for the desktop, but the desktop

05:27.400 --> 05:28.400
as well.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.120
We wanted to pick something that could, you know, cover all of those bases.

05:32.120 --> 05:37.600
Yeah, it seems like there's a lot of the advantages that, and I hate to even associate this word

05:37.600 --> 05:42.160
with it, but go with it for a second, a lot of advantages that you get by using Electron,

05:42.160 --> 05:44.160
but without the downsides.

05:44.160 --> 05:50.920
It's a native application that's produced, it's built in support for GTK3, so it's going

05:50.920 --> 05:53.840
to look and act and run like a Linux app.

05:53.840 --> 05:58.400
Yeah, I mean, Flutter applications, regardless which platform you're running them on, you

05:58.400 --> 06:05.000
know, whether it's a mobile device or Mac OS desktop or Windows desktop, they are highly

06:05.000 --> 06:07.480
optimized native applications.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.880
So it's not a tool like Electron.

06:10.880 --> 06:16.980
They are optimized OpenGL, optimized 3D accelerated apps.

06:16.980 --> 06:20.240
It's interesting, just some of your comments there, it almost makes it sound like some

06:20.240 --> 06:25.960
of this work is a kind of dogfooding, you know, develop more in Flutter from Canonical

06:25.960 --> 06:26.960
directly.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.960
And that just sort of smooths out the issues for other folks that want to use Flutter on

06:29.960 --> 06:30.960
the platform.

06:30.960 --> 06:34.440
Yeah, and there are other projects at Canonical that are using Flutter that, you know, you

06:34.440 --> 06:36.880
won't have seen yet, but you will do in due course.

06:36.880 --> 06:37.880
Ah, very good.

06:37.880 --> 06:42.000
And then do you have any details on this repair function that it looks like the screenshots

06:42.000 --> 06:43.400
are showing for the new installer?

06:43.400 --> 06:47.760
Well, I don't have any hard details about how it's going to work, but the fact that

06:47.760 --> 06:50.840
that icon is presented, there is no accident.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.160
That seems like I can just, I don't know, the possibilities there seem like there is

06:54.160 --> 06:56.840
something that could be developed over time, but like a good one.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.080
Like that's a great, that's going to be a great option for end users.

06:59.080 --> 07:03.320
Well, you know, if you've used things like Chrome OS, it has a power wash feature, for

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
example.

07:04.320 --> 07:08.920
So it would encompass things like that, you know, that you don't have to go back to the

07:08.920 --> 07:14.520
very beginning with a stick in something on a USB flash drive in order to sort of do a

07:14.520 --> 07:17.200
clean install or a fresh install.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.880
You can do that from an installed system as well.

07:19.880 --> 07:24.400
Am I getting the implication that maybe this is taking advantage of some of the ZFS plumbing

07:24.400 --> 07:26.000
that's been happening under the hood?

07:26.000 --> 07:30.280
I can't comment on that, but there are a number of technologies that this is going to be leveraging

07:30.280 --> 07:33.080
that have been developed elsewhere in the Ubuntu ecosystem.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.080
All right.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.840
Well, let's change topics.

07:35.840 --> 07:39.160
You're going to, you have a habit you're going to have to break and it's that we habit because

07:39.160 --> 07:43.000
breaking news.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.160
Just moments ago, Wimpy, you announced that you are taking a new opportunity and moving

07:48.160 --> 07:51.480
on from Canonical after a long time.

07:51.480 --> 07:56.520
And first, I just want to say congratulations and tell me a little bit about the change.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.520
Thank you very much.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.520
Yeah.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.520
I've not gone yet.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.560
I'll be around for a little, don't quite get rid of me just yet.

08:02.560 --> 08:08.860
I'll be around for a little bit longer, but yeah, I'm moving on.

08:08.860 --> 08:10.480
You will know this.

08:10.480 --> 08:15.560
One of the areas of work I've enjoyed most at Canonical is developer advocacy.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.000
You've seen that firsthand.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.680
You got to join us at the Ubuntu rally in New York in 2017 and then a SnapCraft summit

08:23.680 --> 08:27.600
in Seattle the following year, 2018.

08:27.600 --> 08:32.320
So you know the sorts of things that Alan and I have been involved in and I've loved

08:32.320 --> 08:33.320
that work.

08:33.320 --> 08:40.840
So I've been looking to do something where I focus on dev rel, developer advocacy and

08:40.840 --> 08:42.520
community building.

08:42.520 --> 08:47.740
So I'm moving to an organization called Slim AI and I'm going to be working exclusively

08:47.740 --> 08:51.400
as a developer advocate for them and I'm really looking forward to it.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.400
Congratulations.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.400
That's wonderful.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.400
That is really good.

08:54.400 --> 09:00.040
Yeah, that's an area of work that you can drive a lot of passion for and get a lot of

09:00.040 --> 09:01.040
return from.

09:01.040 --> 09:05.560
So Slim AI is an open source platform that automates the creation of fast and flexible

09:05.560 --> 09:08.760
containers for cloud native applications.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.720
And they've recently gotten some funding, so it seems like they've gotten some people

09:11.720 --> 09:17.360
that think they've got a workable and potentially successful product.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.600
Are they in your neck of the woods?

09:18.600 --> 09:19.600
Is it remote work?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.080
What's the details there?

09:21.080 --> 09:22.760
It's a remote position.

09:22.760 --> 09:29.160
The whole company is remote, although the sort of the core of the company are based

09:29.160 --> 09:31.320
in Boston, Massachusetts.

09:31.320 --> 09:36.880
Well I know a lot of us in the community will be sad to see you leave Canonical because

09:36.880 --> 09:42.280
I think a lot of us felt really good about having you there in that position at the top

09:42.280 --> 09:43.900
of the Ubuntu desktop.

09:43.900 --> 09:49.660
But at the same time, I know that when you are available to interact more with the community,

09:49.660 --> 09:58.680
when you are in there as part of the conversation, it has a lot of net benefits that are really

09:58.680 --> 10:01.720
also going to be positive.

10:01.720 --> 10:05.420
And so part of me is sad to see you go, but part of me is actually really happy for you

10:05.420 --> 10:10.720
because I know this is kind of like unleashing you and letting you do what you do best too.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.000
And the net benefit of that is also going to be really good.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.360
We all ultimately will win, but ultimately I'm just happy for you Wimpy.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.360
Congratulations.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.360
Thank you very much.

10:19.360 --> 10:23.920
Now, do you know when we would expect to hear who may be stepping into your old position?

10:23.920 --> 10:27.320
Do you have any kind of indication of when Canonical traditionally makes those types

10:27.320 --> 10:28.320
of announcements?

10:28.320 --> 10:32.040
Well, I don't think Canonical ever announced positions that get filled.

10:32.040 --> 10:37.160
It was a bit weird last time because when Will left, he was well-liked and well-known

10:37.160 --> 10:38.280
in the community.

10:38.280 --> 10:41.520
And I was obviously also well-known in the community.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.280
So there was a little bit of, let's say, a news cycle around that.

10:45.280 --> 10:50.440
But we're not in the position of announcing when people leave and join the company.

10:50.440 --> 10:54.800
Yeah, it's kind of a weird thing, I suppose, in a way, isn't it?

10:54.800 --> 10:57.560
It's not something companies generally like to do.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.600
Well, thank you for letting us know.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.800
And thanks for helping answer some of those questions around the installer.

11:02.800 --> 11:08.440
And on your run here, you got, I think, one of the best LTSs out under your run.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.920
And you'll always have that, regardless of what projects you go on to.

11:11.920 --> 11:15.960
2004 is a hell of a release, and 2010 is really great, too.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.280
Does that mean we can never update?

11:17.280 --> 11:18.280
Dang it.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.280
Yeah.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.520
From henceforth, they'll be called Wimpy Edition.

11:21.520 --> 11:24.920
And we'll run them until the very end.

11:24.920 --> 11:25.920
But yeah.

11:25.920 --> 11:26.920
Well, very good.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.160
Our friends will be hearing more from you.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.400
Yes, you most certainly will.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.120
This will free up a little bit of time for me.

11:33.120 --> 11:39.440
So I'm looking forward to taking up a regular seat on Linux Unplugged again.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.560
Fantastic.

11:40.560 --> 11:47.680
Let's talk about OnePlus 6 and the OnePlus 6T, which may end up receiving mainline Linux

11:47.680 --> 11:51.140
kernel support in the near future.

11:51.140 --> 11:54.460
And you can imagine the long term benefits that could have.

11:54.460 --> 11:57.880
It's been nearly three years since the launch of the OnePlus 6 series, so it's not like

11:57.880 --> 11:59.220
it's the latest.

11:59.220 --> 12:04.020
But if you still have one or want to pick one up used, it may soon be possible to boot

12:04.020 --> 12:06.440
that with good old stock Linux.

12:06.440 --> 12:11.320
And that's thanks to the work of an independent developer named Caleb Connolly, who's been

12:11.320 --> 12:17.480
working hard to include the OnePlus 6 and 6T in the mainline Linux kernel.

12:17.480 --> 12:24.320
Now with the OnePlus 6 and 6T being built atop Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, the upstreaming

12:24.320 --> 12:29.200
effort shouldn't be too hard, mostly just adding all the appropriate device tree bits

12:29.200 --> 12:30.960
for the kernel.

12:30.960 --> 12:35.440
And thanks to the existing minimal mainline support for that platform, things like Bluetooth,

12:35.440 --> 12:42.240
Wi-Fi, 3D acceleration are already working right now, which is great.

12:42.240 --> 12:47.480
What's more interesting maybe though, is that users should be able to dual boot postmarket

12:47.480 --> 12:53.720
OS and Android on the OnePlus 6 and 6T using the installer that the developer has already

12:53.720 --> 12:54.720
created.

12:54.720 --> 12:55.720
So you can try it out now.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.160
You can start using it.

12:57.160 --> 13:01.400
It's probably not daily driver ready or anything, but the results are already promising.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.480
It's a solid, I mean, it's not the latest phone, but that's a solid phone.

13:04.480 --> 13:09.080
Previously, there had been a build of Windows 10 ARM that they got bootstrapped for the

13:09.080 --> 13:13.520
OnePlus 6T by a separate developer, but just nobody really seemed to care.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.040
It just didn't get any interest.

13:16.040 --> 13:21.040
And so it kind of just whittled away, which I guess that tells you something right there.

13:21.040 --> 13:25.000
When Linux is on there, it's headlines, when Windows is on there, it's quickly, quickly

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
forgotten.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.320
All is as it should be.

13:30.320 --> 13:34.360
All right, Mr. Westpain, you know what time it is?

13:34.360 --> 13:39.160
It's been weeks since an Arch upgrade, and we have committed to keeping our Arch server

13:39.160 --> 13:43.000
up to date here live on the show.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.180
And so we figured enough time had gone by, let's do it again.

13:47.180 --> 13:52.040
Probably should have done it weeks ago, but this time it seems like package creep has

13:52.040 --> 13:57.560
snuck in, and there's a lot more packages than I remember being on the system.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.880
125 packages need upgraded, Wes, how you feeling?

14:00.880 --> 14:01.960
Yeah, no kidding.

14:01.960 --> 14:06.840
You posted a little screenshot in an internal channel, and Drew was up in there making fun

14:06.840 --> 14:11.200
of us for all the weird stuff on our server, and I think rightfully so.

14:11.200 --> 14:14.080
Why do we have the Adobe source code pro fonts on here?

14:14.080 --> 14:15.200
It's a server.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.160
Why is Wayland on there?

14:17.160 --> 14:18.160
How did that happen?

14:18.160 --> 14:20.280
Like, how did Wayland get on there, dude?

14:20.280 --> 14:21.640
Thankfully though, it's not too bad.

14:21.640 --> 14:25.120
I mean, this is most of the system, and I think by and large, it's a pretty minimal

14:25.120 --> 14:28.880
install list, which was one of our design goals with this thing.

14:28.880 --> 14:32.160
We've got 500, 600 ish megs to download.

14:32.160 --> 14:35.040
That's an install size of over two gigs.

14:35.040 --> 14:40.760
Hey, look at that nice, fancy compression, but still just a net upgrade size of 10 MB.

14:40.760 --> 14:41.760
I love that.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.820
I love a two gig download.

14:43.820 --> 14:51.120
Normal install size is two gigs, but net upgrade disk space is going to be 10 MB for 125 packages.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.560
That's just fantastic.

14:52.560 --> 14:57.760
So this is essentially absolutely everything on the system, and I'm thinking where we have

14:57.760 --> 15:02.600
this package creep come in, my guess is net data, but I can't say for sure.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.360
But that's the only thing we installed via a script that automatically installs dependencies

15:06.360 --> 15:09.040
and everything else we've installed by hand or it runs in a container.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.040
Yeah, you're right.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.360
That's one of the few things on the system that's not running in a container.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.600
All right, Wes, are you ready to kick off the upgrade?

15:16.600 --> 15:17.600
Standing by.

15:17.600 --> 15:22.440
I've already even put in the Y into the terminal, so I'm just waiting for the go ahead on hit

15:22.440 --> 15:23.440
and enter.

15:23.440 --> 15:24.440
Okay, let's just be clear.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.080
Are you doing Pac-Man or are you doing Yay?

15:26.080 --> 15:27.080
I'm doing Pac-Man.

15:27.080 --> 15:32.160
Okay, so we're not going to do the AUR, which I think is, well, what about ZFS?

15:32.160 --> 15:33.560
Doesn't ZFS come from the AUR?

15:33.560 --> 15:34.680
Yeah, we'll get there.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.120
I mean, we still got the LTS kernel.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.120
We'll do the AUR next.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.120
No, I think that's fine.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.320
I just want to make sure that was your plan.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.440
All right, kick it off, Wes.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.440
Let's do it.

15:42.440 --> 15:47.140
That'll take a little bit to run, so we'll let that go, and then we will come back and

15:47.140 --> 15:50.920
check how it's doing, and then maybe also keep an eye on it to do the AUR.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.960
Just let me know when it's going to reboot.

15:52.960 --> 15:56.440
My God, I can't believe we do this live, and you know that we use that damn server more

15:56.440 --> 15:57.440
than ever now.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.760
Well, there's no going back now.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.440
The new kernel just downloaded.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.160
That's always what makes me nervous.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.360
How was I thinking?

16:06.360 --> 16:09.960
You know what you should do is you should go to linode.com slash unplug.

16:09.960 --> 16:15.080
Don't be like Chris and Wes and run a server out of your garage slash data center.

16:15.080 --> 16:20.400
Go to linode.com slash unplug and receive a $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.640
This is really where I go when I need infrastructure.

16:22.640 --> 16:25.800
We have a bunch of servers that run the backend of JB 3.0.

16:25.800 --> 16:29.120
They are our cloud infrastructure, and we like to be strategic.

16:29.120 --> 16:34.120
We pick from Linode's 11 different data centers depending on what job we think that box is

16:34.120 --> 16:35.120
doing.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.880
A lot of times, if it's an internal tool that doesn't face the audience, we deploy it in

16:38.880 --> 16:44.000
California because we are on the West Coast after all, but we can be strategic about that,

16:44.000 --> 16:48.520
and you can too, and Linode's been doing this for a long time, since 2003, so they've been

16:48.520 --> 16:53.760
able to secure really great data center contracts, really great connectivity contracts, super

16:53.760 --> 16:58.860
fast connections coming into the hypervisors, really fast native SSDs.

16:58.860 --> 17:02.520
You bring it all together with their great interface, and it's just the obvious way to

17:02.520 --> 17:04.300
deploy infrastructure.

17:04.300 --> 17:08.640
This is now my also go-to for making a safe environment for my kids to game.

17:08.640 --> 17:14.160
I've deployed Minecraft and a Rust server, the game, Rust, on Linode.

17:14.160 --> 17:19.440
They make these one-app click deployments for a lot of stuff, including really great

17:19.440 --> 17:24.480
full stacks for getting your website up and running, but they also do them for game servers.

17:24.480 --> 17:28.200
I just deployed a couple, chose the boxes.

17:28.200 --> 17:33.200
It wasn't until just yesterday that I ever needed SSH into one of them and change a config

17:33.200 --> 17:37.520
at the command line, but the way they deploy it, it works the way you would think it would,

17:37.520 --> 17:40.340
so I didn't even bother checking the docs, because I'm that guy, and I thought, let's

17:40.340 --> 17:44.560
see if I can just figure out how Linode deployed this, and so they set up the Rust server.

17:44.560 --> 17:48.640
Well, they set up a Rust user, and in the Rust user's home folder, and that Rust user,

17:48.640 --> 17:53.160
by the way, is what runs the process, not root, and in there, it's simply laid out.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.040
It's a nice, clean layout for a Rust server.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.500
I was able to get to the config, change the option I needed, so that way I could connect

17:58.500 --> 18:03.260
to a custom server under Linux from the client, which is essentially turn off the copy protection,

18:03.260 --> 18:05.800
and saved it, and the performance is fantastic.

18:05.800 --> 18:09.800
I played it from my desktop, and I played it from the G4 streaming, connected into the

18:09.800 --> 18:14.120
server, running off of Linode, and it's just so great, because now I've created an entire

18:14.120 --> 18:18.120
world that runs on our Linode server, and you can deploy anything you need.

18:18.120 --> 18:22.140
Maybe it's a website, maybe it's a portfolio, maybe it's a gallery, or maybe it's the backend

18:22.140 --> 18:24.240
infrastructure for your team's communication.

18:24.240 --> 18:30.320
Linode costs 30 to 50% less than major cloud providers like AWS, and with that $100 credit,

18:30.320 --> 18:33.320
you can really see what I'm saying without having to put anything on the line.

18:33.320 --> 18:37.040
I mean, $100 lets you deploy some serious infrastructure and see how it works.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.120
And I get emails, and thank you for people who send those in, because it's really great

18:40.120 --> 18:41.120
to hear that.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.800
I get emails from people that tell me this is what they're doing now by testing it with

18:44.800 --> 18:49.240
that $100 credit, convincing themselves or convincing management that it works, and then

18:49.240 --> 18:50.580
deploying.

18:50.580 --> 18:53.560
For yourself, for your business, for your company, it's great.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.040
They've been around since 2003, they're going to get it right.

18:56.040 --> 18:59.200
So go to linode.com slash unplugged.

18:59.200 --> 19:04.820
Get that $100, 60-day credit, support the show, help us stay free, and get yourself

19:04.820 --> 19:11.640
that credit, linode.com slash unplugged.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.760
Let's do a little housekeeping while Wes is updating the server.

19:14.760 --> 19:18.080
I think that'll help, give him some time.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.920
You haven't rebooted yet, right?

19:19.920 --> 19:21.480
No, no, of course not.

19:21.480 --> 19:22.480
Okay.

19:22.480 --> 19:23.480
All right, okay, all right.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.040
We've got DKMS modules to build.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.040
Come on, son.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.320
Oh, what's being installed via DKMS?

19:28.320 --> 19:29.320
I'm curious.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.240
Well, we've got a new kernel, so that triggers things to rebuild for ZFS.

19:32.240 --> 19:33.240
Yeah, sure.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.240
Okay.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.240
So maybe we don't need the AUR.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.240
Oh, we'll find out.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.160
In the meantime, just want to give a shout out to the Luplug.

19:39.160 --> 19:43.000
Join our community that gets together and talks about Linux every Sunday.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.420
Also a chance to play around with Mumble.

19:44.420 --> 19:47.960
So if you ever had a chance to join us on the show, you could try it out on Sunday.

19:47.960 --> 19:53.080
We have all the information at our website for Mumble, and we have the calendar at jupyterbroadcasting.com

19:53.080 --> 19:57.060
slash calendar with our live times and also the Luplug on there.

19:57.060 --> 19:59.840
You don't want to miss anything because, I mean, on Minimac, I don't know if you want

19:59.840 --> 20:02.520
to put anything on the record yet, but there's some great stuff coming up.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.480
There is, in fact, some great stuff coming up.

20:05.480 --> 20:10.080
So we scheduled the next recording and I would pass the microphone to Byte Bitten because

20:10.080 --> 20:11.760
he will talk about that a little bit.

20:11.760 --> 20:12.760
Thank you.

20:12.760 --> 20:20.340
So we all have usually our tools as an alternative for the big paid packages.

20:20.340 --> 20:25.960
But sometimes we just want an overview of what is available or what others use and what

20:25.960 --> 20:27.920
is the pros and cons.

20:27.920 --> 20:35.300
So with the next recording, we will create an overview of all the available packages

20:35.300 --> 20:37.760
that are mostly used within our community.

20:37.760 --> 20:38.760
Interesting.

20:38.760 --> 20:41.600
That could be a good way to learn about new apps and stuff that people are using.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.600
Yes.

20:42.600 --> 20:47.720
And later on with other recordings, we will go more in depth on some of those packages

20:47.720 --> 20:51.840
like Nextcloud, Mycroft Assistant, you name it.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.080
So that's every Sunday.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.080
You can join them.

20:54.080 --> 20:57.560
Sometimes Wes and I pop in too, sometimes we even do the show with the Luplug.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.560
Check that out.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.160
Details at linuxunplug.com.

21:00.160 --> 21:04.240
For Mumble, there you go.

21:04.240 --> 21:08.120
That's just about all the delaying I can do for you, Wes, before we check back in.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.120
Where are we at over there?

21:09.120 --> 21:10.120
All right.

21:10.120 --> 21:14.040
Well, no AUR updates yet, but we've gone through Pac-Man.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.560
We've got a new ZFS build.

21:16.560 --> 21:19.320
I say we give her a restart.

21:19.320 --> 21:22.720
Okay, Wes, kick it off.

21:22.720 --> 21:23.780
Let's do it.

21:23.780 --> 21:25.520
No going back now.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.520
Okay.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.760
We'll let that reboot.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.880
We'll check back in.

21:31.880 --> 21:38.600
We'll see how it goes.

21:38.600 --> 21:42.300
I tell you, we really should just do these offline more often.

21:42.300 --> 21:46.400
We shouldn't wait until we do it on air because what happens is we have a busy show and then

21:46.400 --> 21:51.600
we try to stick this in here and then we're trying to do it live when really it just doesn't

21:51.600 --> 21:52.600
work out.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.600
We should just do it once a week.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.800
Maybe what we ought to try for a while is a cron job.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.240
No, this is a horrible idea.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.840
Don't let me talk us into that.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.360
Don't make me take your SSH privileges away.

22:02.360 --> 22:08.160
Now, I wanted to talk about Gnome Shell 40 on the show today, but I want to give a chance

22:08.160 --> 22:13.500
for Carl to jump in and he's going to be joining us a little bit in the show.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.800
So in the meantime, I think we'll jump ahead to feedback.

22:16.800 --> 22:17.800
Let's do the email now.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.840
Let's just do it out of order so that way we give Carl time to join us later in the

22:20.840 --> 22:21.840
show.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.840
How do you feel about that?

22:22.840 --> 22:23.840
How do you feel, Charles?

22:23.840 --> 22:24.840
Yeah, good idea.

22:24.840 --> 22:29.320
Well then, shifting gears to the feedback here in the podcast, out of order, Zach writes

22:29.320 --> 22:34.080
in with a surprising solution for recent Chromium woes.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.680
I'll take this one, Wes.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.200
He says, hey, Chris and Wes, I shared your frustration regarding the recent news that

22:39.200 --> 22:42.720
Google was going to cut off Chromium from Google's sync API.

22:42.720 --> 22:49.480
I'm also in the same boat as you, waiting for Chromium Edge to get built in sync from

22:49.480 --> 22:51.240
Microsoft whenever that comes around.

22:51.240 --> 22:55.160
But in the meantime, I've stumbled on a browser that's hiding in plain sight this

22:55.160 --> 22:58.040
whole time, Epiphany or Gnome Web.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.080
I know what you're thinking.

22:59.080 --> 23:03.920
You've probably used Epiphany in the past and it wasn't quite there really.

23:03.920 --> 23:08.160
But I was there too, until I recently gave it a shot again.

23:08.160 --> 23:11.920
I had a fresh install and I needed to check the Arch Wiki real quick, by the way, he runs

23:11.920 --> 23:16.760
Arch, and I was blown away by how snappy and lightweight it feels when being still quite

23:16.760 --> 23:18.680
feature complete.

23:18.680 --> 23:25.080
And it supports Firefox sync out of the box so you can migrate most, if not all of your

23:25.080 --> 23:28.080
Chrome settings over to Firefox sync service.

23:28.080 --> 23:33.040
They let you import, by the way, and it blows away all of the other browsers.

23:33.040 --> 23:37.640
By the way, it's great for video playback now, but for a while I've had to choose between

23:37.640 --> 23:44.480
X11 and smooth 4K video, but a choppy desktop or Wayland with a smooth desktop, but drop

23:44.480 --> 23:45.960
frames on video playback.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.600
I no longer have to choose.

23:47.600 --> 23:53.840
Epiphany can handle multiple 4K streams running in different tabs on different monitors on

23:53.840 --> 23:58.080
Wayland, and on an integrated Intel GPU, no less.

23:58.080 --> 24:03.720
More than that, I tested my quiet profile on my XPS 15, which disables turbo boost and

24:03.720 --> 24:09.280
maxes my clock at two gigahertz, and I had no slowdowns, not one drop frame.

24:09.280 --> 24:12.480
And it has an unobtrusive UI that gets out of your way.

24:12.480 --> 24:16.160
I could go on, but the bottom line is if you haven't tried Epiphany recently, give it

24:16.160 --> 24:17.240
a chance over the weekend.

24:17.240 --> 24:18.960
I think you're going to be really surprised.

24:18.960 --> 24:22.360
Wow, it really sounds like it's already been Chris tested there.

24:22.360 --> 24:27.280
I agree that, you know, where he's got me is the Firefox sync.

24:27.280 --> 24:32.440
That to me is a killer feature because I like having, I'm a two browser kind of guy.

24:32.440 --> 24:34.880
You know, I don't just stick with one browser.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.200
I got to have multiple browsers.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.320
I could even be a three browser guy.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.700
It's just a lot of effort.

24:40.700 --> 24:45.720
So I stick with two browsers primarily, and that's generally, I divvy up like work or

24:45.720 --> 24:50.520
different account stuff between the different browsers, or if one browser is better at doing,

24:50.520 --> 24:53.560
you know, a Google app or something, I'll use that browser.

24:53.560 --> 24:57.820
But the downside to that is there isn't something like X marks anymore that would sync my Chrome

24:57.820 --> 24:59.720
browser with my Firefox browser.

24:59.720 --> 25:06.500
So I end up having some bookmarks or some whatever extension history, whatever it is,

25:06.500 --> 25:10.680
something in Firefox that isn't in Chrome or vice versa.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.680
And it, it stinks.

25:12.680 --> 25:16.700
This would solve a lot of that, and it would give me that, that two browser lifestyle that

25:16.700 --> 25:20.760
I prefer while completely cutting Chrome out.

25:20.760 --> 25:24.280
And I don't know if I'm there yet, but I like that this is there as an option, and I think

25:24.280 --> 25:27.420
I am going to start using Epiphany a little bit more.

25:27.420 --> 25:28.420
Try it out.

25:28.420 --> 25:30.200
It's probably an option I wouldn't even thought of.

25:30.200 --> 25:34.800
I mean, despite having easy access to it, but to hear that it performs so well and,

25:34.800 --> 25:41.760
you know, is up to stuff with modern CSS and JavaScript features, I guess, why not?

25:41.760 --> 25:44.920
Danny Mac, you point out that it has a really handy app mode.

25:44.920 --> 25:45.920
It really has.

25:45.920 --> 25:55.160
So I'm using Epiphany or Nomweb as my default web app browser, so I have a lot of sites

25:55.160 --> 25:57.360
that I use like Gmail or everything like that.

25:57.360 --> 26:00.280
I lose it in app mode with its own icon.

26:00.280 --> 26:03.840
It shows up in the program list and everything.

26:03.840 --> 26:07.160
And you know that it has a profile separate, stored separated.

26:07.160 --> 26:14.400
So if you have a password, something is separated in a different profile, so it's really handy

26:14.400 --> 26:19.480
and it's really lightweight, so you can have multiple of these apps open and really, really

26:19.480 --> 26:20.480
love it.

26:20.480 --> 26:24.640
It's a good alternative to the Chromium app mode or the Google Chrome app mode.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.040
That is a good tip.

26:26.040 --> 26:30.240
I think I knew that, but I think that's one of those things I've totally, totally forgotten

26:30.240 --> 26:31.240
about.

26:31.240 --> 26:36.320
While we are in this kind of community discussion section, I wanted, and I've been trying to

26:36.320 --> 26:42.720
think about how to bring this up on the show because it's pretty supercharged.

26:42.720 --> 26:46.600
Drew DeVault has a blog that we've covered before on the show.

26:46.600 --> 26:53.200
Drew is a developer behind Sway and has a lot of experience working with Wayland.

26:53.200 --> 27:00.080
And he wrote a post that is titled, I am tired of this anti-Wayland horseshit.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.080
And I'm going to read parts of it.

27:01.080 --> 27:05.120
I'm going to censor some of it because I want this to be available to kids as well.

27:05.120 --> 27:11.320
But he starts with, what do anti-vaxxers, flat earthers, 9-11 truthers, and anti-Wayland

27:11.320 --> 27:13.720
activism all have in common?

27:13.720 --> 27:18.140
All of them are characterized by a belief rejection of facts to embrace a narrative

27:18.140 --> 27:20.840
of victimization by a vague authority.

27:20.840 --> 27:25.240
In the case of Wayland, the vague authority are a bunch of volunteers who have devoted

27:25.240 --> 27:32.200
tens of thousands of hours of their free time towards making free shit for you.

27:32.200 --> 27:36.640
Wayland sucks is a conspiracy theory with no basis in truth, and its supporters have

27:36.640 --> 27:41.100
spent years harassing Wayland maintainers, contributors, and users.

27:41.100 --> 27:43.360
It's time for this to effing stop.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.360
He doesn't say effing though.

27:44.360 --> 27:47.220
A little more explicit in the full post.

27:47.220 --> 27:51.140
Maybe Wayland doesn't work for your precious use case.

27:51.140 --> 27:55.560
More likely it does work, and you've swallowed some propaganda based on an assumption which

27:55.560 --> 27:58.640
you might have been correct seven years ago.

27:58.640 --> 28:06.040
Regardless, I simply don't give a blank about you anymore.

28:06.040 --> 28:10.720
I've tried appealing to reason and rationality and trying to debunk each lie that some Wayland

28:10.720 --> 28:16.680
detractor flavor of the week is touting to toe the party line, but it hasn't worked.

28:16.680 --> 28:18.320
So my new approach is eff you.

28:18.320 --> 28:21.320
None of the Wayland detractors have a clue.

28:21.320 --> 28:25.520
They don't understand Wayland, they don't understand X11, and they don't understand

28:25.520 --> 28:29.800
Linux Graphics or OpenGL or Vulkan or anything else in the stack.

28:29.800 --> 28:33.600
They don't even understand what it's like to use Wayland because at most they might

28:33.600 --> 28:40.440
have spent five minutes installing it, realized that something was gasp different than X11,

28:40.440 --> 28:44.160
and then uninstalled it and wrote their angry Reddit comment.

28:44.160 --> 28:48.860
This is a great reason why I advocate for developers and content creators to never read

28:48.860 --> 28:49.860
the comments.

28:49.860 --> 28:54.080
I think this entire rant was triggered by some comments on Hacker News and obviously

28:54.080 --> 28:55.680
some comments on Reddit.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.880
And you can tell Drew's really, he's burned out here.

28:58.880 --> 29:05.020
He's really kind of sick and tired of the armchair comments that kind of just repeat

29:05.020 --> 29:07.360
crap that has been said online a thousand times.

29:07.360 --> 29:11.920
And we've all seen it, experienced it in some form or another.

29:11.920 --> 29:17.800
But this obviously isn't going to serve to improve the situation.

29:17.800 --> 29:22.320
And I think unfortunately, and I'm going to leave it to the listener to read the rest

29:22.320 --> 29:27.440
if they'd like, because it actually gets even more incendiary as it goes.

29:27.440 --> 29:32.040
But the key point here, I think, the key takeaway is don't be a dick to maintainers and it's

29:32.040 --> 29:33.240
hard on their mental health.

29:33.240 --> 29:37.640
And I think this demonstrates it right here in front of all of us.

29:37.640 --> 29:42.560
I think it's unfortunate though that Drew will be associated, these comments will be

29:42.560 --> 29:47.840
associated, rather Drew intended or not, with the Wayland project and Wayland developers

29:47.840 --> 29:48.840
in general.

29:48.840 --> 29:54.480
And it'll be generic and it'll just be nebulous as part of the Wayland developer attitude.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.440
That kind of stuff, those sort of associations happen with these sort of posts.

29:57.440 --> 30:02.880
Wimby, I noted you're still here and I'm wondering if you have any thoughts in general on pushback

30:02.880 --> 30:05.040
around Wayland adoption and where Drew's coming from.

30:05.040 --> 30:09.660
Do you feel he's got a point or do you feel that he is essentially seeing it as too black

30:09.660 --> 30:10.660
and white?

30:10.660 --> 30:11.660
No, he's got a point for sure.

30:11.660 --> 30:17.980
I mean, it's been a while since Ubuntu last tried on Wayland to see if it worked for them.

30:17.980 --> 30:25.320
I think it was 2017 and you may have seen that we're implementing Wayland by default

30:25.320 --> 30:32.200
in 2104 because some of those issues from a few years ago no longer exist.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.280
So now's the time to make the change.

30:35.280 --> 30:41.800
And Drew's comments about X11 are inflammatory but accurate.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.680
We can't continue to kick that can down the road.

30:45.680 --> 30:52.300
Each time Ubuntu chooses to stick with X11, Canonical and the desktop team are basically

30:52.300 --> 31:00.360
taking on the maintainership of X-specific bugs in Gnome Shell, for example.

31:00.360 --> 31:04.260
And we can't continue to lift that on our own.

31:04.260 --> 31:09.400
So it's better to be a part of a whole and a group moving forward together.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.740
Yeah, that I totally agree with.

31:11.740 --> 31:15.320
And it is getting so much better than it used to be.

31:15.320 --> 31:19.280
And I was really, I was really happy to see that the next release is going to try it again

31:19.280 --> 31:21.280
of Ubuntu is going to try Wayland by default.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.640
I was also extremely disappointed because the guys talked me out of making that one

31:24.640 --> 31:30.240
of my predictions for 2021 and I was sabotaged.

31:30.240 --> 31:31.240
So I was also upset.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.240
Yeah, I know.

31:32.240 --> 31:37.040
Here we are in February and already you've been, you've been scuppered by your own team.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.040
I know.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.040
How unfortunate.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.640
Pipewire's baked in now already to 2104.

31:41.640 --> 31:45.120
Oh, see, now you're talking my language.

31:45.120 --> 31:49.880
Because also I think sticking with Gnome Shell 338 is also going to be a feature, but we'll

31:49.880 --> 31:51.080
get there.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.080
We'll get there.

31:52.080 --> 31:55.360
I'm going to leave this, I'll leave this link to Drew's post.

31:55.360 --> 32:00.440
Again, it's not, it's not Drew R. Drew who comes on the show and edits.

32:00.440 --> 32:05.120
It's, it's Drew Duvall, the Sway developer, not, not R. Drew.

32:05.120 --> 32:10.620
Different Drew, same first name, different Drew, just want to make that disclosure, disclosure.

32:10.620 --> 32:15.920
And I guess buy a Whalen developer a beer when we can start seeing them in public again,

32:15.920 --> 32:18.180
because they are doing the people's work here.

32:18.180 --> 32:19.780
It is a great experience.

32:19.780 --> 32:26.960
And with a few exceptions, I run it at least, you know, on a couple of my machines and the

32:26.960 --> 32:30.920
ones I don't really are the one that has an Nvidia driver.

32:30.920 --> 32:33.200
That's sort of self-evident.

32:33.200 --> 32:39.300
And I don't think my desktop at the moment with plasma, with the multiple monitors, I'm

32:39.300 --> 32:42.680
not generally having a great Whalen time, but it's getting really close and the projects

32:42.680 --> 32:43.680
are doing a lot of work.

32:43.680 --> 32:46.040
Plasma 521 is putting a ton of work into that.

32:46.040 --> 32:49.140
Good Home Shell has been doing so for quite a while.

32:49.140 --> 32:55.440
So the situation, the situation is, is changing, but it, it, if your assumptions are, it's

32:55.440 --> 32:58.560
sort of like, you know, the same thing we run into with ButterFS.

32:58.560 --> 33:03.880
If your assumptions are from your experience from a few years ago, then you're kind of

33:03.880 --> 33:07.520
out of date and you kind of need to, you know, the thing, the things keep improving.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.620
The code gets done.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.200
More people, more people join.

33:11.200 --> 33:15.640
One last email before we move on and talk about GNOME 40.

33:15.640 --> 33:21.160
Ed wrote in, he says, Chris and Wes, you talked about Ventoy last episode, which is that USB

33:21.160 --> 33:25.340
solution that lets you just drop ISOs on the USB thumb drive and then it'll boot any of

33:25.340 --> 33:26.340
those ISOs.

33:26.340 --> 33:28.680
Wes and I have been using the crap out of that already.

33:28.680 --> 33:29.680
No kidding.

33:29.680 --> 33:30.840
He says, thanks for featuring it.

33:30.840 --> 33:35.920
I've been using it for a few months and I think it's a great program, but you guys actually

33:35.920 --> 33:38.120
told me a few more things that I knew you could do with it.

33:38.120 --> 33:39.480
I want to give you a tip.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.800
I first tried it with a normal USB thumb drive.

33:41.800 --> 33:43.320
That's what Wes and I are doing.

33:43.320 --> 33:50.160
He says it works, but I decided to grab an M.2 SATA SSD that I had laying around that

33:50.160 --> 33:58.920
I could install into a USB 3.0 stick and boy, do I see a difference in boot times.

33:58.920 --> 34:03.360
So he links us, we'll have a link in the show notes for this, to an enclosure that is a

34:03.360 --> 34:09.680
USB, it's a big, it looks like a big thumb drive, but you stick an MVME SATA disk into

34:09.680 --> 34:10.680
there.

34:10.680 --> 34:11.680
That's important.

34:11.680 --> 34:15.740
It has to be SATA compatible, but you install that into there and then close it up and it

34:15.740 --> 34:22.240
becomes essentially a super fast thumb drive and it looks really like a great solution

34:22.240 --> 34:23.240
for booting.

34:23.240 --> 34:28.720
And I was, I've been running Gnome Shell 40 a lot and I've been doing a lot of live sessions

34:28.720 --> 34:33.760
to get there and the speed has been something that I have not been satisfied with.

34:33.760 --> 34:37.960
So I picked this up because the price is actually, is really quite reasonable.

34:37.960 --> 34:42.440
So we'll put a link to this and the SSD that I got.

34:42.440 --> 34:50.400
The drive itself is $15.99, 16 bucks for this thing and you just pop it open and you put

34:50.400 --> 34:57.320
the MVME SSD, SATA SSD in there and you're off to the races and it just shows up as a

34:57.320 --> 34:58.320
thumb drive.

34:58.320 --> 35:03.480
So I paired that with just a cheapo $32, so it's not like it's a performance monster,

35:03.480 --> 35:10.600
but it's faster than a USB thumb drive, a $32, 256 gigabyte SATA M.2.

35:10.600 --> 35:14.480
That is plenty for all of the VMs and ISOs you can name.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.480
For sure.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.220
I'm just thinking, Ed, that's a great tip.

35:17.220 --> 35:19.800
And so I wanted to pick it up before a bunch of the audience went and bought one and they

35:19.800 --> 35:20.800
went out of stock.

35:20.800 --> 35:21.800
Yeah.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.440
You know, we should also mention too that just Ventoy can do so much, like yes, it's

35:24.440 --> 35:29.800
good for this, yes, it's also good for, you know, if you get fancy with SATA and SSDs,

35:29.800 --> 35:36.720
but you can also use your little USB to boot from files or VHDs or raw image files from

35:36.720 --> 35:42.000
a VM that are directly on your hard drive, just on your main hard drive and they've even

35:42.000 --> 35:44.920
got a nice little thing you can chain load in your bootloader if you don't want to have

35:44.920 --> 35:48.280
to have an actual Ventoy USB involved at all.

35:48.280 --> 35:51.200
So there's a ton of options included in that project.

35:51.200 --> 35:54.520
That's more for us to play with.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.520
Odear.

35:55.520 --> 36:01.480
Odear.app used promo code Linux for a $10 discount on any plan.

36:01.480 --> 36:06.840
Odear was co-founded by the author of the Cron.Weekly newsletter, listener of the show,

36:06.840 --> 36:11.320
a community member, just a great example of somebody who I think is a perfect sponsor

36:11.320 --> 36:14.480
because they're from the community offering a product to the community.

36:14.480 --> 36:19.080
It's complete website monitoring from multiple locations and it goes deep into the site with

36:19.080 --> 36:23.000
broken link and mixed content detection, advanced SSL reporting.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.520
It'll watch all aspects of your site for performance.

36:25.520 --> 36:29.520
It'll give you an idea of performance is trending downwards or give you a snapshot of a certain

36:29.520 --> 36:30.520
point in time.

36:30.520 --> 36:35.200
Of course, the idea here is to be the first to know if your site's unavailable.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.660
Before your users or your customers, you want to know.

36:37.660 --> 36:42.060
So Odear has global uptime checking with servers worldwide that report a problem from around

36:42.060 --> 36:44.580
the world whenever they see it.

36:44.580 --> 36:48.400
And that deep checking means that if something shows up on the site that you may be broke

36:48.400 --> 36:52.520
because somebody else that you link to went away, you're going to find out about that

36:52.520 --> 36:53.520
kind of stuff.

36:53.520 --> 36:59.520
But something that makes Odear very special is their API and lets you configure everything

36:59.520 --> 37:00.520
about the application.

37:00.520 --> 37:04.760
They have a great dashboard, but what's even better about it is everything you see in that

37:04.760 --> 37:09.200
dashboard can be controlled with an easy to use restful API.

37:09.200 --> 37:15.400
And as a bonus, all the changes you make via the API show up immediately in the dashboard

37:15.400 --> 37:17.420
because they've built it around that.

37:17.420 --> 37:20.160
The idea is they wanted to embrace automation.

37:20.160 --> 37:27.040
So they made a feature complete restful API, and they paired that with kickass documentation.

37:27.040 --> 37:30.800
So you can embrace automation with Odear monitoring.

37:30.800 --> 37:35.080
And that API also means there's already a lot of third party integrations that are totally

37:35.080 --> 37:40.720
possible and ready to go, a CLI client, Telegram chatbot, JavaScript SDK, Terraform provider,

37:40.720 --> 37:43.480
which come on, how great is that?

37:43.480 --> 37:45.560
Talk about building into your automation.

37:45.560 --> 37:49.320
So right now, head over to odear.app and start your 10 day, no strings attached trial, no

37:49.320 --> 37:50.320
credit card required.

37:50.320 --> 37:52.280
You can get set up in less than a minute.

37:52.280 --> 37:56.920
And then when you do sign up for a plan, use the promo code Linux for a $10 discount.

37:56.920 --> 38:00.360
And if they ask you via email or something, or when you're chatting with support at some

38:00.360 --> 38:03.520
point, tell them you heard about it right here on the Linux Unplugged program.

38:03.520 --> 38:12.800
It's odear.app and this promo code Linux for a $10 discount on any plan, odear.app.

38:12.800 --> 38:16.920
So we've been trying to wrap our heads around how to talk about GNOME Shell 40 because it's

38:16.920 --> 38:18.800
a pretty big change.

38:18.800 --> 38:25.120
And in retrospective, I kind of understand why they are calling it GNOME 40 and not GNOME

38:25.120 --> 38:27.160
4.0.

38:27.160 --> 38:28.840
They wanted, I think, the space.

38:28.840 --> 38:32.280
It's kind of like when Star Trek Discovery went 1,000 years into the future, they needed

38:32.280 --> 38:36.240
the canon space to do what they needed to do here.

38:36.240 --> 38:40.760
But with that means that those of us who have used GNOME Shell in its current iteration

38:40.760 --> 38:45.200
for a long time are going to have our workflow changed.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.220
Primarily it's this horizontal workspace.

38:47.220 --> 38:49.280
That's the main change that we're going to be talking about today.

38:49.280 --> 38:50.800
There's other improvements.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.760
It's looking like in a lot of ways a very good release.

38:53.760 --> 38:56.080
The team is really coming together.

38:56.080 --> 38:59.520
Canonical even though they're sticking with GNOME Shell 338 in their next release is still

38:59.520 --> 39:02.320
working upstream.

39:02.320 --> 39:03.880
They're still contributing patches upstream.

39:03.880 --> 39:04.880
Right.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.520
It's not like they're going to stay there forever.

39:06.520 --> 39:09.100
It's just going to take a little while before that all gets integrated.

39:09.100 --> 39:12.400
But what's been recently merged now, and so we've had a chance to actually play with it

39:12.400 --> 39:18.200
because the great thing about, quote unquote, journalism in open source, and I think more

39:18.200 --> 39:21.080
people should be doing this, is we can get our hands on the code.

39:21.080 --> 39:26.060
A lot of times it's in a state where we can build it and we can try it ourselves.

39:26.060 --> 39:29.600
We can go beyond just reading what people write about it.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.160
We wanted to try it.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.680
Wes and I did just that.

39:33.680 --> 39:37.560
There's various methods to get it up and running at this point, GNOME Shell 40 with a new UI.

39:37.560 --> 39:39.080
We both used Fedora as a base.

39:39.080 --> 39:44.920
I used Rawhide and then a script that Wes found, I think from the GNOME team, to build

39:44.920 --> 39:48.080
the latest GNOME Shell 40 on top of Rawhide.

39:48.080 --> 39:52.160
And Wes, I think you did it via copper at one point, and then you also did the build

39:52.160 --> 39:53.160
script as well.

39:53.160 --> 39:54.560
So you had a pretty fresh install.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.560
Yeah.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.560
There's a couple of things.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.860
I think early on there was a copper that got some updates to it.

39:58.860 --> 40:02.720
There's even now just a VM image you can boot and use out there, so we had to go the hard

40:02.720 --> 40:03.720
way.

40:03.720 --> 40:07.840
We went from the latest Fedora, pulling down the development right out of the repos and

40:07.840 --> 40:08.840
building it.

40:08.840 --> 40:13.140
And thankfully, since a lot of this stuff happens on Fedora oftentimes anyway, you can

40:13.140 --> 40:15.260
just use DNF to install the build depths.

40:15.260 --> 40:20.000
That takes care of a lot of the complexity for you and just run the Ninja and away you

40:20.000 --> 40:21.000
go.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Yeah.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.520
And you are Ninja Go.

40:23.520 --> 40:28.840
The changes are significant enough that I thought it was appropriate to try it on hardware,

40:28.840 --> 40:34.040
but while there is a way to get it working on VM, it just felt like this needed to be

40:34.040 --> 40:35.040
experienced with hardware.

40:35.040 --> 40:39.260
I wanted to try it with multiple monitors because I think that's one area that this

40:39.260 --> 40:40.600
needs a lot of discussion.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.560
And so that was the route I took.

40:42.560 --> 40:47.400
So a lot of this code's just really fresh, and there is more work being done upstream,

40:47.400 --> 40:53.040
but there are ways to try it out right now to see this new horizontal workflow.

40:53.040 --> 40:59.800
And I'm going to provide in the show notes a link to a very short, like 28-second video

40:59.800 --> 41:05.940
I put up on our PeerTube instance of my three monitor workstation so you can get a visual

41:05.940 --> 41:06.940
of this.

41:06.940 --> 41:10.920
That link is in the show notes, and you can see what that looks like while we're talking

41:10.920 --> 41:12.600
about this.

41:12.600 --> 41:16.640
Because it's a hard thing to explain, but if you can picture the way the elementary

41:16.640 --> 41:23.760
desktop works, or not the same degree, but the way the Mac OS multiple desktops used

41:23.760 --> 41:29.400
to work where the desktop zooms into the background, the dock comes up from the bottom, a search

41:29.400 --> 41:35.400
launcher along the top, and then your workspaces are laid out horizontally to the right.

41:35.400 --> 41:40.080
And they are dynamically generated as you launch applications and place them on there.

41:40.080 --> 41:43.120
And this is all demonstrated in that PeerTube link.

41:43.120 --> 41:49.680
And also, our buddy Carl did a great job of writing this up in what I think was just sort

41:49.680 --> 41:57.920
of started as a bit of a tweet vent, but actually developed into some solid observational feedback.

41:57.920 --> 42:03.360
And Alan Day got involved on Carl's observations about where GNOME Shell 40 is going.

42:03.360 --> 42:08.920
And what I love about this, Carl, is you are through and through a GNOME guy.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.840
I know you've been using it for a long time.

42:10.840 --> 42:13.560
You've often rolled with what the project is doing.

42:13.560 --> 42:17.080
This is the first time where it's kind of, they're changing the default and it's leaving

42:17.080 --> 42:18.080
you behind.

42:18.080 --> 42:23.040
And you're one of those particular, a thorn in the sides of the GNOME developers because

42:23.040 --> 42:28.240
you're doing this thing where you want your virtual workspaces to span all of your monitors.

42:28.240 --> 42:34.480
By default, GNOME Shell leaves your second or third monitor static, and only the primary

42:34.480 --> 42:36.880
display actually changes workspaces.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.840
But you can change that.

42:38.840 --> 42:42.160
Until now, that's kind of going away because it just sort of falls apart.

42:42.160 --> 42:47.320
So Carl, I think you do, I should let you explain it from here because you did such

42:47.320 --> 42:48.320
a great job on Twitter.

42:48.320 --> 42:51.800
But can you kind of break down what the problem is and kind of why you feel like you're being

42:51.800 --> 42:53.920
left behind as a GNOME Shell user?

42:53.920 --> 42:54.920
Sure thing.

42:54.920 --> 42:56.640
I mean, you already summarized it really well.

42:56.640 --> 42:57.640
Not sure what else I can say.

42:57.640 --> 42:58.640
Oh, did I?

42:58.640 --> 43:01.680
I thought I was, I thought I struggled, so I'm glad I kind of got it right.

43:01.680 --> 43:02.680
No, that's it.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.480
I mean, like I said, I like GNOME a lot.

43:04.480 --> 43:05.840
I've used it for a while.

43:05.840 --> 43:08.160
I was so, so to it in the GNOME 2 days.

43:08.160 --> 43:11.640
GNOME 3 was weird at first, but eventually after I started trying it again, I was like,

43:11.640 --> 43:12.640
okay, I see what they're doing.

43:12.640 --> 43:17.760
You know, they got me hooked on the vertical workspaces and now they're taking it away.

43:17.760 --> 43:18.760
Why vertical?

43:18.760 --> 43:20.440
Why vertical instead of horizontal?

43:20.440 --> 43:21.920
So for me, I'm a multi-monitor guy.

43:21.920 --> 43:26.160
I use three monitors spread horizontally across my desk.

43:26.160 --> 43:30.800
And whenever you have three monitors horizontally like that, physical monitors, adding a new

43:30.800 --> 43:35.720
virtual workspace vertically just gives you rows of three underneath each other as you

43:35.720 --> 43:36.720
keep adding them.

43:36.720 --> 43:42.800
So you just get this three by whatever grid of however many virtual workspaces you have.

43:42.800 --> 43:46.480
But in the horizontal layout, they get added side by side.

43:46.480 --> 43:52.440
So you go from a one by three to a one by six to a one by nine to a one by 12.

43:52.440 --> 43:57.120
And it just quickly, I mean, I routinely have five to 10 virtual workspaces going for different

43:57.120 --> 43:58.480
tasks that I'm doing.

43:58.480 --> 44:03.640
And I like having three fresh displays every time I start a new workspace up.

44:03.640 --> 44:06.800
And now that just gets very unmanageable very quickly.

44:06.800 --> 44:11.480
Yeah, it gets really kind of awful too on my setup where I have three displays and two

44:11.480 --> 44:14.940
of them are vertical and then the center is horizontal.

44:14.940 --> 44:19.380
When I start to get multiple desktops, it's really awkward to navigate.

44:19.380 --> 44:24.680
This to me doesn't really like disrupt my workflow because I switch desktops all the

44:24.680 --> 44:25.680
time.

44:25.680 --> 44:26.800
I'm used to things changing on me.

44:26.800 --> 44:30.560
But it does seem like a bit of a downgrade in overall efficiency.

44:30.560 --> 44:34.040
And I know, Wimpage, it's great that you're here today because I know that Canonical was

44:34.040 --> 44:40.420
looking at this for the next release of the Ubuntu desktop and decided not yet, not no,

44:40.420 --> 44:41.420
but not yet.

44:41.420 --> 44:45.080
Yeah, and that decision has nothing to do with the design changes as it happens.

44:45.080 --> 44:46.080
Oh, really?

44:46.080 --> 44:48.240
I thought it was actually 100% about the design changes.

44:48.240 --> 44:49.240
No, it's not.

44:49.240 --> 44:50.240
Well, aside from GTK4, right?

44:50.240 --> 44:53.280
So, you know, it's not to do with the design changes at all.

44:53.280 --> 44:57.520
It's to do with where we are in the release cycle and when feature freeze happens for

44:57.520 --> 45:00.520
the next release, which is later this month.

45:00.520 --> 45:07.300
And there's simply not enough time for us to do the main inclusion request processing

45:07.300 --> 45:13.080
for the new stuff that needs to be in the main archive, which has to be security reviewed

45:13.080 --> 45:17.760
before we can introduce it to meet our deadlines.

45:17.760 --> 45:22.680
So we're purely putting it off because we can't get there in time.

45:22.680 --> 45:31.440
And in fact, I met with the Yuru team last night to discuss GTK4 and GNOME 40 and some

45:31.440 --> 45:35.280
of the design changes and how we could accommodate all of that.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.860
And they were very clear that it was business as usual.

45:37.860 --> 45:40.720
This wasn't going to present any major road bumps.

45:40.720 --> 45:45.440
So yeah, our move forward is for very different reasons.

45:45.440 --> 45:48.520
Curious what your personal opinion is about the design change.

45:48.520 --> 45:53.880
So I was quite fortunate to be invited to a session with the GNOME Foundation at the

45:53.880 --> 45:55.800
back end of last year.

45:55.800 --> 46:03.740
They recently commissioned some user acceptance testing to look at a number of different prototypes

46:03.740 --> 46:11.360
and different ways that the GNOME shell had been presented to users in different distributions

46:11.360 --> 46:16.080
to sort of inform some of the changes that they were going to make in GNOME 40.

46:16.080 --> 46:21.560
So it's really good to see that, you know, the changes that they are introducing have

46:21.560 --> 46:27.640
been sort of, you know, user tested and there is data to support the direction that they're

46:27.640 --> 46:28.640
going in.

46:28.640 --> 46:36.040
Now, from a personal point of view, the business of switching workspaces and leaving a screen

46:36.040 --> 46:38.800
behind, I'm really not a fan of.

46:38.800 --> 46:41.480
I know that's a configuration option right now.

46:41.480 --> 46:45.880
And it's a configuration option that I personally enable.

46:45.880 --> 46:51.360
But you know, in the great scheme of things, I think the direction that they're going in

46:51.360 --> 46:53.600
is is a wise one.

46:53.600 --> 46:55.880
Certainly they've got data to support what they're doing.

46:55.880 --> 47:01.980
I could see how spatially it makes more sense for new users because you see it laid out

47:01.980 --> 47:04.640
and everything's next to each other and you're kind of moving to them.

47:04.640 --> 47:10.040
What I don't like about it from an efficiency standpoint is with the current vertical stack,

47:10.040 --> 47:12.200
you can see everything in the overview mode.

47:12.200 --> 47:14.640
You can see all of the desktops at once.

47:14.640 --> 47:16.200
That goes away with this.

47:16.200 --> 47:21.520
But additionally, it scales a lot better when you have multiple screens where this really

47:21.520 --> 47:22.520
falls apart.

47:22.520 --> 47:24.560
Say you have three monitors.

47:24.560 --> 47:29.960
You have like three squares you have to move through to get to the new desktop.

47:29.960 --> 47:32.680
It's it really kind of doesn't scale properly.

47:32.680 --> 47:34.880
And I think, Carl, there's two issues here.

47:34.880 --> 47:41.320
The issue is workspaces should be spannable across multiple monitors, which right now

47:41.320 --> 47:42.440
they're not designing for.

47:42.440 --> 47:43.440
Right.

47:43.440 --> 47:44.440
That's not the default setting.

47:44.440 --> 47:45.440
That's issue number one.

47:45.440 --> 47:46.440
Right.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.920
And the question there is, are we ever really going to see traction on that?

47:48.920 --> 47:52.920
Because it doesn't seem like Fordy's being designed at all with that consideration.

47:52.920 --> 47:53.920
Right.

47:53.920 --> 47:57.000
And the thing that gets me, I know they're doing a lot of user testing with this, but

47:57.000 --> 48:01.440
I honestly I'm speculating here, but I don't think that they're doing any user testing

48:01.440 --> 48:03.040
on multi monitor, at least.

48:03.040 --> 48:04.040
No, they're not.

48:04.040 --> 48:07.200
Yeah, that's a that's a huge oversight in my mind.

48:07.200 --> 48:11.180
There is a reason for that as well, which was explained, which is that they did the

48:11.180 --> 48:18.120
user testing remotely and there's no way to simulate multi monitor user testing under

48:18.120 --> 48:19.480
remote conditions.

48:19.480 --> 48:24.360
So it was a known sort of gap in the way that they were testing things.

48:24.360 --> 48:28.400
That's unfortunate because even using sort of the latest builds, I'm not going from copper,

48:28.400 --> 48:34.820
I was building it and there's pretty obvious bugs moving stuff around in multi mon.

48:34.820 --> 48:36.120
It's not smooth yet.

48:36.120 --> 48:40.000
And I understand it's alpha and I actually have every confidence that a lot of the stuff

48:40.000 --> 48:41.080
will be worked out.

48:41.080 --> 48:44.080
It's a really solid, you know, it's it's it's changed, but they're going to they're going

48:44.080 --> 48:45.080
to fix it.

48:45.080 --> 48:50.120
But it is troubling when I hear that, that it's not being tested on multi monitor is

48:50.120 --> 48:55.200
a major shift and to and to make that major shift without the user testing experience

48:55.200 --> 48:59.280
of a multi monitor, that's going to leave a large portion of the of the user base just

48:59.280 --> 49:00.280
out in the cold.

49:00.280 --> 49:01.280
Yeah.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.280
Yeah.

49:02.280 --> 49:05.120
Just so that we're clear, Carl, that's really two main issues again.

49:05.120 --> 49:08.320
One is workspaces that span all the monitors.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.920
But what's the second issue here?

49:09.920 --> 49:14.160
From what Manuel, one of the known developers was discussing on Twitter with me about he

49:14.160 --> 49:18.360
says that, you know, that is one issue, just the desire to have workspaces span across

49:18.360 --> 49:21.200
all monitors, which, to be clear, that's not a default.

49:21.200 --> 49:24.960
That's something you have to go in with either tweaks or decomp settings and change.

49:24.960 --> 49:30.000
The other thing is once you do enable workspaces across all monitors, things are messy in the

49:30.000 --> 49:34.280
horizontal layout, because by default, the horizontal layout isn't a problem and it works

49:34.280 --> 49:35.280
well for them.

49:35.280 --> 49:39.040
So they kind of want to classify it as two separate problems there.

49:39.040 --> 49:42.800
And I can kind of appreciate that when just trying to break it down from how do we address

49:42.800 --> 49:43.800
this?

49:43.800 --> 49:46.800
And that may actually be the first part of figuring this out.

49:46.800 --> 49:47.800
Right.

49:47.800 --> 49:48.800
Yeah.

49:48.800 --> 49:52.760
Establish that there is value in having, you know, spanning workspaces across all monitors,

49:52.760 --> 49:56.980
not just as a hidden decon for gnome tweaks setting, but something that perhaps is even

49:56.980 --> 50:00.520
right directly in gnome settings to allow people to do and set up.

50:00.520 --> 50:04.560
I'd even take something in gnome tweak, put it in tweaks.

50:04.560 --> 50:08.760
I guess the reason that Carl and I were, we were talking about this off air and I thought,

50:08.760 --> 50:13.860
you know, after chatting with him and after trying it myself, I think the takeaway we

50:13.860 --> 50:18.860
have is if you're on a laptop or you're a single monitor set up, it's probably not going

50:18.860 --> 50:20.600
to be a big change for you.

50:20.600 --> 50:25.780
If you're on a multi monitor set up, this first release may be one to sit out and stick

50:25.780 --> 50:31.720
with gnome 338 and upgrade to gnome 41 or 42 when they get some of this other stuff

50:31.720 --> 50:36.480
worked out, because I tried it here on my ThinkPad and it's actually really not bad.

50:36.480 --> 50:37.480
It works pretty well.

50:37.480 --> 50:41.960
It does, I feel like it's, it's a bit of a loss because the way I could move windows

50:41.960 --> 50:47.480
around it was like a much smaller and it doesn't quite work right and it seems a little buggy,

50:47.480 --> 50:49.400
but I can see where they're going with it.

50:49.400 --> 50:52.840
And on a single screen on a laptop, it's pretty usable.

50:52.840 --> 50:53.840
Yeah, same.

50:53.840 --> 50:54.840
That was kind of my experience.

50:54.840 --> 50:56.960
Like, okay, yeah, I could get used to this on a single screen.

50:56.960 --> 50:59.960
I mean, that would be, I would have forgotten about it in a week's time.

50:59.960 --> 51:00.960
Yeah.

51:00.960 --> 51:03.560
On multiple monitors though, this is where we kind of wanted to put a bit of a disclaimer

51:03.560 --> 51:06.520
and say, hey, you might want to think about skipping this one.

51:06.520 --> 51:11.960
But it's not to, you know, to be disrespectful to the gnome team or anything like that.

51:11.960 --> 51:13.720
It's just having tested it.

51:13.720 --> 51:16.120
I think that's something you guys should know about.

51:16.120 --> 51:19.440
And we all have links to all this stuff so you can see what the hell we're talking about

51:19.440 --> 51:23.160
and get a visual when you're listening to this in the show notes there.

51:23.160 --> 51:24.360
I'm sure they'll get it, right, Carl?

51:24.360 --> 51:28.680
I mean, you, you, you see the thing with the gnome, with the gnome shell team is like they,

51:28.680 --> 51:31.760
God, I feel horrible even like criticizing them because I know eventually they're going

51:31.760 --> 51:32.760
to work it out.

51:32.760 --> 51:38.200
As it is right now, it, it just doesn't seem very usable, but I have the faith, I think.

51:38.200 --> 51:39.200
I want to have faith.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.200
Yeah, exactly.

51:40.200 --> 51:43.960
I definitely think they have good intentions and I can understand a lot of them have mentioned

51:43.960 --> 51:49.960
how the, the gesture support in gnome 40 with a touch pad on a laptop with a single screen

51:49.960 --> 51:50.960
is so good.

51:50.960 --> 51:51.960
They can't go back.

51:51.960 --> 51:56.680
And I can understand and respect that that's something that a lot of people will find valuable,

51:56.680 --> 52:01.720
but the multi-monitor thing is just at some point you have to realize that that is, I

52:01.720 --> 52:05.920
don't know, maybe the best possible outcome is that they actually make optional vertical

52:05.920 --> 52:10.680
workspaces, not just an extension, but like a built-in native supported thing where you

52:10.680 --> 52:13.280
choose, do you want them horizontal or vertical?

52:13.280 --> 52:17.080
Minimac, perhaps they could take inspiration from another desktop environment.

52:17.080 --> 52:18.080
Yeah.

52:18.080 --> 52:22.560
We were laughing about in the pre-show, there is always a solution and it's called enlightenment

52:22.560 --> 52:27.140
because enlightenment has that for decades because it treats the desktop.

52:27.140 --> 52:31.560
Every screen is treated independently and that is so gorgeous.

52:31.560 --> 52:38.520
I can have four virtual desktops on my left screen and three on the right one, and I can

52:38.520 --> 52:45.500
just skip these workspaces just on the left screen and on the right screen independently.

52:45.500 --> 52:47.320
That would be the solution, right?

52:47.320 --> 52:52.960
That would mean you would have to rethink gnome shell, that it treats the screens independently.

52:52.960 --> 52:59.520
So imagine you would have just these possibility as you have now in, apparently you're having

52:59.520 --> 53:05.960
in gnome 3.38, that you can just have a window overview for your left screen and the window

53:05.960 --> 53:08.600
overview for your right screen.

53:08.600 --> 53:14.720
That is so gorgeous and enlightenment has that for decades and that was my primary thing

53:14.720 --> 53:17.160
because I switched to enlightenment.

53:17.160 --> 53:21.200
A point that you, of course, wanted to make sure we did not miss.

53:21.200 --> 53:23.680
So thank you for adding that.

53:23.680 --> 53:28.660
And of course, I think, Carl, I'm supposed to tell you to try plasma.

53:28.660 --> 53:30.120
Has that crossed your mind?

53:30.120 --> 53:35.880
I still haven't seen any way to do dynamic workspaces in plasma or enlightenment or any

53:35.880 --> 53:36.880
other desktop.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.360
If I'm missing something, please let me know.

53:38.360 --> 53:40.320
I'll try other desktops.

53:40.320 --> 53:42.440
I like gnome, but I'm not married to gnome.

53:42.440 --> 53:45.680
If there's something else that does it, then I'm all ears.

53:45.680 --> 53:49.240
You just got to preallocate like three times more than you'll ever possibly need.

53:49.240 --> 53:51.800
Just get a giant grid.

53:51.800 --> 53:52.800
That's right.

53:52.800 --> 53:53.800
There you go.

53:53.800 --> 53:54.800
That'll take care of it.

53:54.800 --> 53:55.800
Hashtag Marte desktop.

53:55.800 --> 53:56.800
Oh, yeah.

53:56.800 --> 54:02.400
Also, I think just to allay concerns, Ubuntu Marte remains under your stewardship with

54:02.400 --> 54:03.880
this transition, right, Wimpy?

54:03.880 --> 54:04.880
Yes, indeed.

54:04.880 --> 54:06.840
That is my passion project.

54:06.840 --> 54:12.440
It's the thing that I love doing in my spare time and I will continue to do so.

54:12.440 --> 54:13.440
That's good to hear.

54:13.440 --> 54:14.440
All right.

54:14.440 --> 54:19.160
Now, before we run and before we update, before we get an Arch server update.

54:19.160 --> 54:20.160
It's not the distro.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.160
It's how you use it.

54:21.160 --> 54:25.600
I want to mention that if you want to follow your stonks in the terminal, we've got an

54:25.600 --> 54:27.280
app pick for you.

54:27.280 --> 54:28.280
It's called Ticker.

54:28.280 --> 54:32.100
It's a terminal stock ticker with live updates and position tracking.

54:32.100 --> 54:36.440
Why wouldn't you want to have that in your drop-down terminal?

54:36.440 --> 54:37.640
It's not written in Rust, is it?

54:37.640 --> 54:41.560
Because that would be really perfect, but it doesn't look like it is, unfortunately.

54:41.560 --> 54:43.160
So we won't be able to play the Rust horns.

54:43.160 --> 54:45.440
It does look like you could probably run it in Docker.

54:45.440 --> 54:46.440
So I mean, maybe if we had some sort of...

54:46.440 --> 54:47.520
It is written in Go.

54:47.520 --> 54:48.520
That's got to be a close second.

54:48.520 --> 54:49.520
Okay.

54:49.520 --> 54:50.840
I just don't have any theme music for Go.

54:50.840 --> 54:51.840
Yeah.

54:51.840 --> 54:52.840
Yeah.

54:52.840 --> 54:54.560
Also, it'll track cryptos, I believe, as well.

54:54.560 --> 54:58.240
So if you're investing big in the Doge over there, like Wes Payne is, you can keep an

54:58.240 --> 54:59.680
eye on that as well.

54:59.680 --> 55:00.680
We had to.

55:00.680 --> 55:04.120
I mean, with all the news going on, that had to be our pick this week, right?

55:04.120 --> 55:07.520
You need a nerdy desktop terminal client to keep track of things.

55:07.520 --> 55:08.520
Yeah.

55:08.520 --> 55:12.240
If you don't have an option for every possible single use case so I can avoid a web app,

55:12.240 --> 55:13.240
what are we even doing here?

55:13.240 --> 55:18.080
I want to say a special thank you to the scientifically confirmed most awesome people in the world.

55:18.080 --> 55:22.040
That would be our Unplugged Core contributors at unpluggedcore.com.

55:22.040 --> 55:25.720
Keeping this show indie, helping us reduce the ad load, and getting yourselves not one

55:25.720 --> 55:27.700
but two different feeds.

55:27.700 --> 55:31.240
Limited ad feed, just the same full production, but limited ads.

55:31.240 --> 55:33.480
So it's a little bit shorter runtime.

55:33.480 --> 55:35.880
You get just what you want in there.

55:35.880 --> 55:36.880
Not a little bit too much.

55:36.880 --> 55:37.880
I appreciate.

55:37.880 --> 55:42.720
I appreciate the busy, busy core contributor, and we value their time.

55:42.720 --> 55:45.620
If you're on the other end, maybe you want a little more content.

55:45.620 --> 55:47.720
Maybe you like the bootleg kind of music.

55:47.720 --> 55:48.720
You're one of those people.

55:48.720 --> 55:51.120
You like the live tracks, well, that's feed two.

55:51.120 --> 55:52.120
Live stream.

55:52.120 --> 55:53.120
All our screw ups.

55:53.120 --> 55:56.960
All the stuff that Joe cuts from the show, because thank God he makes it sound better.

55:56.960 --> 55:58.760
But we leave it in for you.

55:58.760 --> 56:04.220
Transparency is the name of the game with full pre and post shows.

56:04.220 --> 56:05.880
It's basically an extra show.

56:05.880 --> 56:06.880
It's right there.

56:06.880 --> 56:08.560
You just don't even know about it.

56:08.560 --> 56:10.520
So I'm jumping around the room.

56:10.520 --> 56:11.520
I'm so excited about it.

56:11.520 --> 56:14.520
It's unpluggedcore.com.

56:14.520 --> 56:23.000
And I think if we could get 15 new members for next episode, I'm going to get Wes Payne

56:23.000 --> 56:26.480
to drink three beers before the show.

56:26.480 --> 56:27.480
That's fair, right, Wes?

56:27.480 --> 56:28.480
That's fair.

56:28.480 --> 56:29.480
Yeah.

56:29.480 --> 56:30.480
All right.

56:30.480 --> 56:31.480
I will sacrifice my body for the show.

56:31.480 --> 56:35.960
I think that's a bad idea, because I had three beers before this show, and I've been

56:35.960 --> 56:37.960
having to dash to the toilet.

56:37.960 --> 56:38.960
Oh, there is that.

56:38.960 --> 56:39.960
Yeah.

56:39.960 --> 56:40.960
Yeah.

56:40.960 --> 56:41.960
Yeah.

56:41.960 --> 56:42.960
Well, you know, we'll just give him a wireless mic.

56:42.960 --> 56:43.960
Right?

56:43.960 --> 56:44.960
Yeah.

56:44.960 --> 56:45.960
Podcast from the potty.

56:45.960 --> 56:46.960
Yeah.

56:46.960 --> 56:47.960
I know how to mute appropriately, I think.

56:47.960 --> 56:48.960
Yeah.

56:48.960 --> 56:49.960
Yeah.

56:49.960 --> 56:50.960
It's all about appropriate muting.

56:50.960 --> 56:51.960
Exactly.

56:51.960 --> 56:52.960
Like a pro.

56:52.960 --> 56:53.960
All right.

56:53.960 --> 56:54.960
Well, I want to mention you can join us live.

56:54.960 --> 56:57.240
You may hear us mention mumble rooms and chat rooms and stuff like that.

56:57.240 --> 57:01.960
Well, we do this show live every single Tuesday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

57:01.960 --> 57:04.000
See you next week.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.560
Same bat time, same bat station.

57:06.560 --> 57:09.460
And wouldn't it just be great if you could join us for that?

57:09.460 --> 57:12.900
So do make an effort one of these days if you can, or maybe on a Sunday.

57:12.900 --> 57:14.720
We just love hanging out with you.

57:14.720 --> 57:19.720
It really it really does feel like one of the happiest, best communities on the Internet.

57:19.720 --> 57:21.680
And we'd love for you to be a part of it.

57:21.680 --> 57:25.940
Thanks to everybody who goes over to linuxunplug.com slash contact and sends in feedback or tips

57:25.940 --> 57:30.000
to the show, helping it make it better that way as well, or shares it with a friend.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.840
All of that is very, very much appreciated.

57:32.840 --> 57:36.960
The entire network of Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter, Jupiter broadcasting.

57:36.960 --> 57:37.960
Easy for me to say.

57:37.960 --> 57:43.280
Jupiter broadcasting shows that's over at Jupiter broadcasting dot com links to everything

57:43.280 --> 57:48.640
we talked about today as at linuxunplug.com slash three nine one.

57:48.640 --> 57:51.880
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the unplug program.

57:51.880 --> 58:17.960
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

58:21.880 --> 58:36.040
All right, everybody, let's go pick our title.

58:36.040 --> 58:37.040
JBtitles.com

58:37.040 --> 58:38.040
JBtitles.com

58:38.040 --> 58:39.040
Head on over there.

58:39.040 --> 58:42.040
There's only one place to vote.

58:42.040 --> 58:44.560
JBtitles, JBtitles.

58:44.560 --> 58:47.120
Now you all got to go boat.

58:47.120 --> 58:50.800
Hey, Wes Payne, just real quick.

58:50.800 --> 58:55.040
Just curious, how did it how did it go over there?

58:55.040 --> 58:57.180
We are back online.

58:57.180 --> 58:58.600
So the update was done.

58:58.600 --> 58:59.600
Yeah, flawless.

58:59.600 --> 59:00.600
ZFS mounted.

59:00.600 --> 59:01.600
No problem.

59:01.600 --> 59:02.600
Yeah.

59:02.600 --> 59:03.600
Docker containers are up.

59:03.600 --> 59:04.600
I'm right back on the box.

59:04.600 --> 59:07.480
So that's pretty anticlimactic then.

59:07.480 --> 59:09.040
Well, congratulations.

59:09.040 --> 59:12.200
I will say we didn't have any ZFS updates this time.

59:12.200 --> 59:13.200
So that kept things simpler.

59:13.200 --> 59:14.200
Ah yes.

59:14.200 --> 59:16.600
And that's because the AOR package has been flagged out of date.

59:16.600 --> 59:19.960
There's been actually just a point release out I think today or yesterday and another

59:19.960 --> 59:24.320
one a little bit earlier this month to two point zero point one and two point zero point

59:24.320 --> 59:25.320
two.

59:25.320 --> 59:26.860
That was from yesterday.

59:26.860 --> 59:28.880
So presumably those will be there soon.

59:28.880 --> 59:50.280
And maybe we can do this whole thing again next time.
