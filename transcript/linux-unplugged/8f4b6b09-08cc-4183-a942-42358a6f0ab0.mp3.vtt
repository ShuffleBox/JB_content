WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.080
All of my thanks this saved the show today. Otherwise, we'd be still waiting to get started

00:05.080 --> 00:10.000
We'd be later than we already are. No way. This is my best open source feature of the day g-edit

00:10.000 --> 00:15.280
I didn't even realize this has this brilliant brilliant feature that allows you to

00:15.920 --> 00:21.880
Cancel a huge huge file opening so I was on really I accidentally we're gonna play some clips from Brian control

00:21.880 --> 00:27.080
We're gonna bust some myths and I accidentally spelled the dot MKV file dot MK

00:27.080 --> 00:31.920
That's not the same thing. No. No, everybody knows that's the Mortal Kombat file. That's not what you want

00:31.920 --> 00:38.040
So I double-clicked it and g-edit starts to open up because of course g-edit is my default editor for Mortal Kombat files

00:38.160 --> 00:40.400
right up naturally and it

00:41.280 --> 00:43.280
My whole system just kind of goes

00:44.440 --> 00:48.800
What happens everything slows down g-edit sort of

00:50.720 --> 00:53.040
What's happening and then a

00:53.040 --> 00:59.800
A little blue window of hope slides down and it shows a loading bar

01:00.360 --> 01:02.360
with a cancel button and

01:03.040 --> 01:08.040
So yeah, I was able to click this and somehow not only did they manage to put in a cancel button?

01:08.120 --> 01:15.420
But like they're properly threading the application. So it actually registered exactly. That's where that's where it's like. Yes, finally

01:15.420 --> 01:20.280
Yeah, so it cancelled and boom my system came back immediately instead of opening up a multi megabyte

01:20.280 --> 01:24.160
These are the things we want to be able to tell the Windows users and be like, this is why you need Linux

01:24.160 --> 01:29.800
Yeah, it's almost like thank you G and thank you for being awesome in subtle ways that today was my favorite open source feature

01:31.280 --> 01:36.560
This is Linux unplugged episode 167 for October 18th, 2016

01:36.560 --> 01:38.560
And 16

01:48.120 --> 01:54.540
Well, welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's busting myths and fun this week

01:54.920 --> 01:58.800
My name is Chris. My name is Wes L. Wes this show

01:58.800 --> 02:02.520
I was I'll be honest with you if I was new to podcasting

02:02.520 --> 02:08.240
I'd have butterflies in my tummy about how big the show is this week. You know what to do with yourself now though

02:08.240 --> 02:12.240
I have my good friend alcohol those no kidding. Actually, it's just a really great show

02:12.440 --> 02:15.680
And I can't wait for us to get into it. We have

02:16.360 --> 02:22.920
Legitimately multiple breaking news stories at the top of the show that we'll get into so some great project updates

02:22.920 --> 02:28.740
We've got a really great picture from the KDE project about their long-term vision for the plasma desktop

02:29.160 --> 02:30.360
then

02:30.360 --> 02:36.960
We're gonna actually get into some fascinating kernel discussion. Yeah, I know I know what that is a thing and it's gonna be

02:37.420 --> 02:41.960
Really interesting because we'll segue into some recent criticism that Linux has been coming under

02:42.240 --> 02:47.560
That sounds really reasonable and would probably make you think if you heard this story you probably think oh shit

02:47.560 --> 02:49.520
What is Linux doing right? This is embarrassing

02:49.520 --> 02:56.640
So we're gonna bust these myths in this week's episode then at the end of the show, we're gonna get real with you guys

02:56.640 --> 03:03.340
Let's talk about the role of free software in a world. It just doesn't care people just don't care

03:04.020 --> 03:09.260
Microsoft Apple they're doing good enough. These are the names people know let them control the computing platform

03:09.480 --> 03:14.380
Why bother with it? It seems to be going fine. They know what they're doing corporate masters. Why should I care?

03:15.220 --> 03:20.600
So we're gonna we're gonna talk about the role of free software in a world that at least for the most part seems to have

03:20.600 --> 03:27.920
That opinion so before we get started. There's one order of business that we must attend to and that's welcoming in our virtual log

03:27.920 --> 03:29.920
time appropriate greetings mumble room

03:35.200 --> 03:39.880
It's like it's almost like music except for not at all like music because it's

03:41.280 --> 03:47.120
No better than music. So let's start with are you guys ready for me to just should I just get right into all of like

03:47.120 --> 03:51.760
The the quote-unquote breaking news, you know, I have to do it. I can't I can't stop myself

03:54.320 --> 03:58.040
Oh, man, it feels good every time I have an excuse to play that I got to admit it

03:58.040 --> 04:03.440
So let's start with the lighter of the breaking news and and we'll do a little follow-up and look into this some of the stuff

04:03.440 --> 04:08.520
And I'm really jazzed about but we've got the first story is just sort of the lighter one

04:08.520 --> 04:11.960
We have the name for Ubuntu 1704. It's gonna be dubbed

04:12.600 --> 04:14.560
You know what it is with?

04:14.560 --> 04:18.600
Zesty's a puss. Oh you do. Look at you. Yep, and it's gonna launch on April

04:19.080 --> 04:24.120
2017 that's coming from looked at the zepus. It's it's actually pretty darn cute. Oh, is it?

04:24.120 --> 04:27.360
I have the pictures I saw online made it look like a disgusting rat

04:27.360 --> 04:32.720
Well, yeah, but it's more like a cute little mouse like creature. No, that's a squirrel. Mm-hmm. Oh, you're right

04:36.480 --> 04:41.760
Yeah, well, I'm sure they'll go for the cuter one that's for sure so that is that's sort of the

04:41.760 --> 04:44.960
Lighter of the breaking news. What do you think of that name?

04:46.000 --> 04:50.280
It's probably pretty hard. You know what? I mean, there's a lot of choices. There's fun things like zebras

04:50.280 --> 04:53.720
You have to that's the obvious choice, right? I mean everyone thinks you're gonna go for zebra

04:53.720 --> 04:57.600
So they don't want to seem obvious. They've had a lot of kind of good interesting selections before

04:57.920 --> 05:01.680
I think I actually think canonical has broke

05:02.760 --> 05:05.160
Release naming to a point where I just don't care

05:05.680 --> 05:07.000
Like when you you know

05:07.000 --> 05:11.840
They got these crazy names and fedora tried to go their own crazy one with the meaty hot dog or whatever it was for a while

05:12.080 --> 05:13.480
but this

05:13.480 --> 05:18.340
This this shenanigans that's been going on now since the 1204 series or whatever

05:18.340 --> 05:23.680
I mean for a little while like they made them sound like they were sturdy and sound but now they're just like it's just

05:23.680 --> 05:28.200
An animal now, they're just cray-cray and I think marks just delighting and making us all say these words

05:28.200 --> 05:32.760
I honestly believe that's what's happening. It's on now. I'm like, yeah, this is broken for me. Yes

05:32.760 --> 05:35.480
I can't think we they have the nice little numbers that everyone uses anyway

05:35.480 --> 05:38.880
So I always have to like double check me like which one cuz you know, it's like on the mirrors

05:38.880 --> 05:42.960
It's always by the name. I'm like, yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely, especially after it's been a couple of years

05:42.960 --> 05:47.920
I just can't mama room. What do you think of the name? Anybody have thoughts on naming in general? Do you care at all?

05:50.680 --> 05:54.080
Fair enough. Yeah, I don't I'm just gonna need something to put on the the numbers

05:54.080 --> 05:56.440
What matters is the number for the version that really matters?

05:57.560 --> 06:01.840
Okay, I wanted to give a give the room a moment

06:01.840 --> 06:09.360
To do any addressing or criticisms of ours while we're on the Ubuntu topic of our review in

06:09.760 --> 06:14.160
Episode 439 of the Linux action show that came out on Sunday. We reviewed Ubuntu 1610

06:14.160 --> 06:15.920
Did you get a chance to see it? Yes, I did

06:15.920 --> 06:23.000
Do you have any criticisms or follow-up or any thoughts about our review? You know, I'm interested honestly, I I

06:23.560 --> 06:28.680
Think you guys are the ones reading the release notes and like kind of the the hype after the immediacy of the release

06:28.680 --> 06:32.120
It really seems like they're coming coming hard on the cloud

06:32.920 --> 06:36.320
Data center scale. Those are the things that I saw that stood out to me that I was excited for right?

06:36.320 --> 06:37.880
I like Lexi. I like that kind of stuff

06:37.880 --> 06:42.360
So I'm interested and I feel like the desktop I didn't hear as much about and I haven't tried it myself yet

06:42.360 --> 06:44.360
So I'm kind of waiting to see

06:44.800 --> 06:48.240
Both both both of your opinions are interesting, but I don't know where I fall yet

06:48.720 --> 06:54.720
Yeah, I think I think a lot of people in the audience are waiting anybody in the mum room by chance have 1610

06:54.720 --> 06:56.720
I'm gonna bet no, but anybody have it installed

06:56.720 --> 06:59.920
Yep, okay one guy

07:00.680 --> 07:05.080
Excellent. All right. How are you? How's your experience been so far? Okay, two people. All right. Okay

07:05.960 --> 07:07.960
First guy, how is your experience been so far?

07:08.640 --> 07:10.160
It's been fine

07:10.160 --> 07:12.160
Some things are broken, but nothing major

07:12.760 --> 07:14.760
okay, well you say some things like

07:16.280 --> 07:18.480
I had some problems with

07:19.120 --> 07:25.920
The video monitors, but it's an Nvidia issue and I had it with 1604 and I had it before that with 1510

07:25.920 --> 07:27.920
So this is like Linux release problems. Yeah

07:28.800 --> 07:30.800
Who's number two?

07:30.840 --> 07:34.000
Thank you. I have mr. Mav. How's your experience been so far?

07:35.440 --> 07:42.440
For the most part pretty smooth. I actually have it on my c720 and also have it on my desktop right now

07:42.440 --> 07:45.440
well, I've actually switched back to event to from

07:46.200 --> 07:49.360
art for a little bit for stability sake and just to

07:49.360 --> 07:56.520
Just streamline my workflow chillin out for a better working. Well, I will say 4.8 and in a bunch user land

07:56.520 --> 07:58.520
That's pretty sweet. Yeah. Yeah

07:59.120 --> 08:04.600
4.8. Oh though, which will get more on in a minute. Let's let's go to our next breaking news story. I

08:06.120 --> 08:08.120
Can't help myself. I'm sorry. I'm

08:08.560 --> 08:13.200
Watched a lot of CNN. I've watched a lot of news recently for actually a few years

08:13.200 --> 08:18.800
This story is probably the most news relevant. Although not the only breaking news story

08:20.240 --> 08:26.240
But probably when we all care a lot about are you familiar with VeraCrypt that's the they forked TrueCrypt, right?

08:26.240 --> 08:31.080
Right when the project current maintainer the old maintainer said I'm probably shouldn't use it anymore

08:31.080 --> 08:31.280
Yeah

08:31.280 --> 08:31.800
I'm out

08:31.800 --> 08:37.040
VeraCrypt is a fork of TrueCrypt and one of the best things about VeraCrypt is it's able to mount your old TrueCrypt

08:37.040 --> 08:43.240
Oh, right because they right. Yeah, that's kind of a big deal. So VeraCrypt has been undergoing an audit and today

08:43.800 --> 08:45.800
As we record just a few hours ago

08:46.240 --> 08:51.420
The public release of the results has landed and here's the quick and dirty about VeraCrypt

08:52.480 --> 08:59.920
VeraCrypt 1.18 and its bootloaders were evaluated this release included a number of new features including non-western developed encryption options and a bootloader

08:59.920 --> 09:02.320
That supports UEFI. Oh, thank goodness

09:02.320 --> 09:04.320
I

09:05.240 --> 09:07.960
Quick labs the people that did the audit found eight

09:09.080 --> 09:13.320
critical vulnerabilities three medium vulnerabilities and 15 low or

09:14.720 --> 09:15.800
informational

09:15.800 --> 09:21.680
vulnerability concerns now within the security audit industry that that's like best practice stuff and

09:22.200 --> 09:24.200
consider this or could lead to

09:25.320 --> 09:29.400
So the public disclosure of these vulnerabilities consides with the release of their crypt

09:29.400 --> 09:34.840
1.19 which fixes the vast majority of the high priority concerns

09:34.840 --> 09:40.640
So if you are using VeraCrypt and you get on version 1.19, you're pretty much protected from all of this stuff

09:40.640 --> 09:43.600
Hey, that's nice. Yeah, really nice. And I think I

09:44.640 --> 09:49.160
Don't think we should let the that that detail pass by the responsiveness of the project to the audit, right?

09:49.160 --> 09:51.840
That's either half of I benefit of absolutely

09:51.840 --> 09:58.520
It shows a strong project with an intent to keep their end users protected and it's polling on the core strengths of open source

09:58.520 --> 10:02.920
Those are three things behind a security product like this that matter a lot to me

10:02.920 --> 10:07.480
So version 1.19 which fixes the vast majority of these high priority concerns is out

10:07.600 --> 10:12.360
Some of these issues have not been fixed due to high complexity for the proposed fixes

10:13.040 --> 10:18.240
but workarounds have been presented in documentation for VeraCrypt to review and

10:19.800 --> 10:24.880
Here's another takeaway I have for you if you use the ghost cipher for encryption

10:24.880 --> 10:28.000
Its implementation was fundamentally unsafe

10:29.120 --> 10:31.360
And they're ripping it out

10:31.360 --> 10:36.800
So they're gonna leave in the ability to decrypt it for now, but new volumes cannot be created with this cipher

10:36.800 --> 10:41.840
So upgrade to VeraCrypt 1.19 and move your data to a new volume if you use the go cipher

10:42.480 --> 10:46.240
you know be interested to see kind of the further reviews of this some like

10:46.640 --> 10:50.840
Once one one point one nine is that what people see as they say it because you know

10:50.840 --> 10:54.360
It's some of these I'm not a cryptographer. Some of this is like a you know to kind of interpret

10:54.360 --> 11:00.920
It's a little disappointing to see that the ghost stuff as well as it's ghost not ghost. I'm not sure. Oh, no, you're right

11:00.920 --> 11:02.920
There's no H. I'm just being a spaz

11:02.960 --> 11:03.880
Thanks

11:03.880 --> 11:06.800
it is nice to see a lot of the issues are you know a lot of things that are

11:07.120 --> 11:10.960
Fixing here's like the a lot of issues pointed out are in the bootloader those ones

11:10.960 --> 11:15.000
I'm less concerned with so we'll see how how they continue to be responsive see how yeah

11:15.000 --> 11:16.680
How much of the critical issues they fix?

11:16.680 --> 11:21.980
We'll see that was my takeaway too is the bootloader was the source of a lot of the issues and that's not

11:21.980 --> 11:24.860
Functionality I used from TrueCrypt and not functionality

11:24.860 --> 11:29.660
I would use from Vericrypt and I don't know I don't know the long-term sustainability of this project

11:29.660 --> 11:31.660
But it is nice to see active development. I do think

11:32.580 --> 11:34.580
Cross-platform encryption is a worthy goal

11:35.380 --> 11:38.740
Personally like Lux or other Linux based encryption tools meet my needs

11:38.740 --> 11:41.620
So I'm I haven't used TrueCrypt or Vericrypt for many years

11:41.620 --> 11:45.220
But it's a project or at least the idea of which I would support I did the same thing

11:45.220 --> 11:52.300
I moved to Lux after the TrueCrypt tobacco. I just said right done with that going with the built-in solution and

11:52.900 --> 11:57.580
honestly Lux on an external USB volume has worked remarkably well for me and

11:58.300 --> 12:00.300
Lux has

12:00.580 --> 12:06.080
Essentially become the default when you check encrypt my home folder on installers. You're almost always using Lux

12:06.780 --> 12:09.540
So it's just kind of been the one I've I've landed on

12:10.180 --> 12:12.820
Before we go on because this is some some pretty cool stuff

12:12.820 --> 12:15.860
And if anybody has any thoughts on it, I don't I don't

12:16.660 --> 12:22.620
Want to miss your input so since we have several new people in the mumble room aka the virtual lug today

12:22.620 --> 12:25.420
I just want to let you guys know that if you want to get my attention

12:26.100 --> 12:28.100
Just tag me in the chat room with mum

12:28.620 --> 12:33.700
Mus so do like Chris ass Chris last mum colon and then what it is that you'd like to get in on the show and

12:34.300 --> 12:37.440
I will try to I will call on you as we go along just that way

12:38.100 --> 12:41.500
Keeps things organized yeah, yeah, so that's because I know we got actually good

12:41.500 --> 12:45.420
We got good. We got a good mix of long-term errs and and newbies in there

12:45.780 --> 12:52.760
So that's so could you know what good on the veracrit project for not only working with this audit, but again

12:53.220 --> 12:57.260
Shipping one dot one nine, and this is how this works right the the auditors find issues

12:57.260 --> 13:03.460
They work with the project on a on a like a gag order type basis to give them a certain amount of time typically to fix

13:03.460 --> 13:05.460
up the problems

13:05.940 --> 13:09.020
But if you watch tech snap you know that sometimes

13:09.020 --> 13:14.860
This goes differently and the projects or the companies don't meet the deadline set by the auditors

13:14.860 --> 13:16.860
And then the auditors go public

13:16.900 --> 13:18.900
while the software isn't fixed and

13:19.180 --> 13:25.380
It's it's a real catch-22 because it puts a lot of pressure on the developers to actually deliver a patch

13:26.540 --> 13:34.460
But it also gives attackers a heads up to start going after end users that are unpatched and the fundamental issue here is

13:34.460 --> 13:40.620
Even once you release an update. There's a massive lag time often for users to actually actually get all those updates

13:40.620 --> 13:47.160
So that's still an issue even here. There's there are guaranteed way more people on veracrypt one dot

13:48.140 --> 13:50.500
18 then there are now on one dot one nine

13:50.580 --> 13:55.460
So there's a lot of users that are exposed so there's a window of time that attackers could take advantage of this

13:55.460 --> 13:59.100
I will say looking at this at the PDF. They made as a report of this

13:59.100 --> 14:03.900
It's pretty readable, so it might be something fun to check out even if you're not super interested in

14:04.320 --> 14:08.220
Cryptography nice nice that'll be linked so if you go to the story in the show notes is that linked

14:08.340 --> 14:10.340
Yeah, there it is right there at the bottom of the article

14:10.780 --> 14:11.900
cool

14:11.900 --> 14:13.500
Good stuff good stuff

14:13.500 --> 14:18.780
And thanks to the veracrypt project for taking on true crypt because that felt like such a loss there for a little bit

14:18.780 --> 14:20.700
It did so it was really cool all right Wes

14:20.700 --> 14:26.340
I want to talk about something that's new and great from Linux Academy our first sponsor this week on the unplugged program go to

14:26.340 --> 14:31.140
Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and take advantage of their new seven-day free trial

14:32.260 --> 14:36.140
Now I've been a member of Linux Academy for a long time so I can tell you it's worth it

14:36.140 --> 14:38.140
But this gives you a chance to try it out yourself

14:39.060 --> 14:45.240
Kick it see what happens poke it. There's zero raw at it zero risk bang on it

14:45.340 --> 14:51.380
See what Linux Academy is all about take a look at their courseware take a look at their feature set you'll experience something

14:51.380 --> 14:54.060
I think is unique because Linux Academy itself is unique

14:54.060 --> 14:59.260
They're built by people who are really passionate about Linux people who were developers educators

15:00.180 --> 15:02.380
system administrators Linux enthusiasts

15:02.380 --> 15:04.540
They came together and they created the Linux Academy platform

15:04.540 --> 15:08.460
And I'm not making this up because I spoke to the owner of Linux Academy

15:08.460 --> 15:14.100
I've been we've known each other for years now, but even before they became a sponsor. We had an email thread about

15:15.140 --> 15:20.740
How he was how he watched JB about doing podcasts and things like that and it there's a great synergy

15:20.740 --> 15:24.900
But it was it was one of these situations where I he and I kind of landed on this

15:25.180 --> 15:27.660
On a conversation thread where we got very honest, and I said God

15:27.660 --> 15:30.500
You know I maybe I should have thought about doing this because it's really brilliant

15:30.500 --> 15:37.180
It's a great way to advocate and promote the Linux platform while delivering in a content driven way because all of this is with

15:37.180 --> 15:41.660
Content they have labs and self-paced courses that you can go through they have core

15:41.740 --> 15:44.100
Schedulers that work with how much time you have available

15:44.100 --> 15:48.500
They have learning paths that give you content planned by instructors for specific career tracks

15:48.500 --> 15:50.860
I think it's also a great business model just to show you know

15:50.860 --> 15:55.020
It's like they're working a lot with all these open source tools and platforms and and yet

15:55.020 --> 15:59.980
They're also providing a very good service that you know it's it's it's affordable. You'll get a lot out of it

15:59.980 --> 16:03.860
I think it's clever to like that seven-day free trial think about how much you can learn in seven days

16:03.860 --> 16:08.460
You're gonna get hooked and you're gonna want you're gonna want more and now they have external profiles, too

16:08.460 --> 16:14.540
So if you want to just sort of prove to either your employer or a potential employer all of the courseware you've taken

16:14.740 --> 16:16.780
They've got it. They've got external profiles

16:16.780 --> 16:20.020
they have a great community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members and

16:21.180 --> 16:25.780
Check out their new quick starts about two hour courses with you get in there

16:25.780 --> 16:27.600
It's like actually it's about two hours

16:27.600 --> 16:31.140
And it can be up to like six or eight different courses that you take in that time

16:31.220 --> 16:36.820
So it's a really great compact way to get a burst of information and knowledge right into your brain organ

16:36.820 --> 16:38.820
Let's hang them linuxacademy.com

16:39.140 --> 16:41.940
Slash unplug that's where you go to support this show and sign up

16:42.540 --> 16:44.220
for a free

16:44.220 --> 16:49.400
Seven-day trial. Thanks Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

16:50.180 --> 16:56.020
Now I go to the virtual log to ask anybody in there anybody a plasma desktop user anybody running

16:56.660 --> 17:00.980
Plasma 5 8 or a recent version. I know tomorrow is but he's not in there today

17:02.780 --> 17:10.020
Nope he's our big KTE guy. He really you know he's a he represents. He does. He's he's there fierce running the neon

17:10.020 --> 17:15.460
Mm-hmm yeah, yeah cutting edge, but we do have a little bit of a picture for those of you that might be interested perhaps

17:15.460 --> 17:17.460
people listening at home

17:18.460 --> 17:23.700
Might be a plasma desktop user well we have a little snapshot of what's coming up

17:23.820 --> 17:27.920
They say their general direction point towards professional use cases, which is

17:28.660 --> 17:32.480
Hey, that's just that's music to my ears. Well. He is I love that

17:32.480 --> 17:36.760
We want a plasma to be a solid tool a reliable workhorse that gets out of the way

17:36.760 --> 17:41.600
Allowing the user to get the job done quickly and elegantly

17:42.160 --> 17:44.160
we want to be faster and

17:44.680 --> 17:49.800
Better quality than the competition. I like all those things are great goals now

17:49.800 --> 17:53.400
Here's how it's all going to break down our plan is to move from a four to three

17:53.680 --> 18:01.680
From four to three yearly releases in 2017 and 2018 which we think strike a nice balance between our pace of development and the stabilization

18:01.680 --> 18:07.640
Periods around that our discussion of the release schedule resulted in a following plan. I'm gonna. I'm gonna underscore here

18:07.640 --> 18:11.760
This is probably all subject to change right well. Here's kind of what they're thinking

18:12.920 --> 18:18.200
Plasma 5.9. The 31st the 31st of January 2017 so this is all 2017

18:18.840 --> 18:22.040
Plasma 510 in May plasma 511 in September

18:22.600 --> 18:29.840
So you kind of get an idea of the cadence there plasma 512 in December plasma 513 in July 2017

18:29.840 --> 18:38.480
Plasma 513 in April 2018 plasma 514 LTS August of 2018 so that's our next LTS in August of 2018

18:38.520 --> 18:40.600
So this is this is this is interesting

18:40.600 --> 18:44.640
So they're going from four to three yearly releases and so you can see it stretching out

18:44.640 --> 18:50.640
But what I think that means is sort of a stabilization of the landing spot for plasma desktop users

18:50.640 --> 18:52.640
I think this is a really really good

18:53.800 --> 18:58.800
Kind of rough plan even if they can't nail it exactly and it's fascinating kind of being on the outside getting to look in

18:58.800 --> 19:04.320
With this much transparency into like their inner working they say that they're gonna keep working on the breeze theme

19:04.320 --> 19:06.840
They're gonna double down on this refinements and existing details

19:06.960 --> 19:11.880
They're gonna work on icons across the whole UI and better theming for GTK

19:11.960 --> 19:18.440
They have a feature backlog that they plan to get on including perhaps support for the global menu similar to the way unity or Mac

19:18.440 --> 19:22.520
OS do it hey, what do you think of that? You know I don't use it myself, but

19:23.040 --> 19:27.080
Kitty is already so customizable. I can see why you know if plasma had this feature as well

19:27.080 --> 19:31.840
I think that'd be great also probably not a surprise to us. They're working more on Wayland

19:32.480 --> 19:35.800
Kaywin brings them almost feature complete Wayland display server now

19:36.320 --> 19:42.480
Which is remember how remember how you have to write your own Wayland display server Wow what a task for these desktop environments

19:42.480 --> 19:47.280
Just to go from being a client to have to be the server which they say already works in most use cases

19:47.280 --> 19:51.760
But hasn't seen a lot of real-world testing and lacks certain features that x11 users expect right now

19:51.760 --> 19:54.200
Or ones they want to offer on modern hardware

19:54.200 --> 19:59.560
so I like that too and of course they're gonna continue to work on plasma mobile, but

20:00.400 --> 20:02.160
You know typically

20:02.160 --> 20:05.480
We could easily say oh no another project is focusing on mobile

20:05.480 --> 20:10.840
But um I actually feel like being three or four down on the list of things to do is just about the right spot

20:10.840 --> 20:12.240
It's something you want to keep working on

20:12.240 --> 20:15.280
It's something you don't want to lose too much ground on right

20:15.280 --> 20:20.780
But it probably shouldn't be the primary focus of your project at least at this stage until something ships that makes it

20:20.780 --> 20:25.960
That makes it make sense right yeah, so I think I again. I feel like they've got this online services. They plan

20:26.520 --> 20:28.520
improvements and integration of online services and

20:29.240 --> 20:31.720
Dependency handling for assets installed from the store

20:32.240 --> 20:39.080
They have a developer recruitment outreach. They plan to double down on as well. Go help them out. I yeah, right yeah, I

20:39.720 --> 20:45.800
Really think that this project is firing all cylinders right now. Don't it feel like it does it really does especially with that Wayland stuff

20:45.800 --> 20:49.460
I'm excited to see that it feels like an I don't know maybe this time next year

20:49.460 --> 20:53.800
We'll be talking about how great Katie. You know plasma is on Wayland. Well five eight is a solid release

20:53.800 --> 20:58.740
I mean right I still have it no. I don't have it on any systems anymore. That's right

20:58.740 --> 21:03.240
I had to I did I did a full full court install for a boon to 1610 and

21:03.640 --> 21:07.680
That was that was a serious process um before we move on tech mav

21:07.680 --> 21:10.600
I wanted to circle back you had more to say about the 1610

21:11.360 --> 21:13.360
deployment go ahead

21:14.400 --> 21:15.880
Tech Mav

21:15.880 --> 21:17.360
Tech Mav

21:17.360 --> 21:19.960
If you tagged me you should hello. No

21:22.160 --> 21:28.640
Hmm our loss you know if I could do voices. I would just pretend to be one of the entire mumble room like

21:29.120 --> 21:34.360
That is worth thinking. I won't say a thing yeah, there we go. Hello, Tech Mav. Control not shift

21:35.360 --> 21:40.440
So yeah, you wanted if you wanted to loop back to the 1610 stuff well because we're about to talk a little more about

21:40.440 --> 21:43.200
So this is sort of be a good spot to follow up. Oh

21:43.200 --> 21:48.840
Oh, no, I was just you were having about I've got eight for Katie and I switched

21:48.840 --> 21:54.560
I was on a five dot eight K plasma before I went to the 1610 of Ubuntu

21:55.440 --> 21:58.200
Okay, oh, and what were your thoughts I?

21:59.400 --> 22:05.440
Mean the plasma that was actually the best experience of plasma. I've had a long time. It's very smooth

22:05.440 --> 22:12.320
And I like how they are really focusing on integrating breathe across the board yeah

22:12.880 --> 22:18.480
That's they've done really good at that and also it was pretty cool to see the Android connect stuff built-in

22:18.480 --> 22:22.600
Do you have you did you get to play with that at all? Yeah, very good. I did some yes

22:22.800 --> 22:28.080
Yeah, that's and works great with my Motorola. Yeah, that is that is super nice

22:28.080 --> 22:31.200
And it really feels like the future when you're getting there all right

22:31.200 --> 22:38.400
Thank you, Tech Mav for the fall of now while we're talking about Ubuntu stuff. This is CNN breaking news. I can't I'm sorry

22:38.400 --> 22:40.560
I'm sorry. It's okay. It's just I'm not saying anything

22:40.560 --> 22:46.640
How many how many days how many times do we have like three or four really big stories break in the Linux world right?

22:46.640 --> 22:48.920
And thank God. They're just not about politics

22:49.000 --> 22:54.040
So this is when you hear about this at first you're gonna say oh well great red hats already doing this

22:54.200 --> 22:57.760
Suits Enterprise already doing this what's the big news Ubuntu once again?

22:57.760 --> 23:01.960
Doing their own thing remember actually all of that is wrong

23:01.960 --> 23:08.440
But you're probably familiar with the concept of hot fixing or hot patching or live patching a running Linux kernel

23:08.680 --> 23:14.240
Red Hat has their thing to do it Sousa has their thing to do it the kpatch and ksplice for respect

23:14.280 --> 23:19.480
Respectively right there's that Oracle proprietary one yes, it's a big issue in the enterprise

23:20.200 --> 23:26.640
Especially that up when you're running VMs or when you got a bunch of containers you got a host machine that maybe has 30

23:26.640 --> 23:31.000
Containers on or even five containers you to update that running kernel and get it secure

23:31.040 --> 23:36.560
You've got to restart all of those subsystems as well, and it's just it often just goes undone right

23:36.880 --> 23:40.080
And then you're left vulnerable and so Red Hat

23:40.840 --> 23:42.240
worked

23:42.240 --> 23:47.600
Really hard on their solution for this they've really they've put they put a lot of time a lot of engineers

23:47.600 --> 23:52.360
They're very very proud of it and very shortly after that Sousa also well. Hey we've been working on this

23:52.360 --> 23:55.520
We're very proud of this and just just behind the scenes

23:55.520 --> 24:03.120
all of these companies now have have reached out from their PR people to tell me all about it to tell me all of the

24:03.120 --> 24:06.880
Different things to make sure that I know everything about it, so they're all very

24:07.640 --> 24:10.560
Each each of these companies have been very yes

24:11.200 --> 24:15.240
Very wanted to make sure they get the message out there, but I actually think canonical has the best

24:15.880 --> 24:19.920
Implementation they might be the last of the party, but sometimes that's a good thing right and

24:19.920 --> 24:27.800
This is something that you listening at home with your one computer or many computers can use so you don't need an enterprise plan

24:27.800 --> 24:34.720
You don't have to be a reddit enterprise user or a Sousa enterprise user if you have a buntu on your laptop or your desktop

24:35.000 --> 24:38.480
It just has to be 1604 on x86, and you can do this

24:38.480 --> 24:45.920
So this is the ability to patch critical security vulnerabilities live in your kernel without rebooting and

24:45.920 --> 24:51.020
This is what they're rolling out today. It's called the canonical live patch service

24:51.200 --> 24:56.200
Ubuntu 1604 LTS is a 4.4 kernel includes an important new security capability in

24:56.520 --> 25:01.800
Ubuntu the ability to modify the running Linux kernel code think that's like the code in RAM

25:02.000 --> 25:06.720
It's amazing without rebooting through a mechanism called kernel live patch

25:07.460 --> 25:13.040
Today canonical has publicly launched the canonical live patch service and authenticated

25:13.640 --> 25:14.920
encrypted

25:14.920 --> 25:22.280
Signed stream of Linux live patches that apply to 64-bit Intel AMD architectures of the Ubuntu 1604

25:22.440 --> 25:23.960
LTS release

25:23.960 --> 25:26.280
Have to be running the kernel 4 4 generic

25:26.280 --> 25:28.760
I think or something can't be running your own patch version

25:29.160 --> 25:36.120
Addressing the highest and most critical security vulnerabilities without requiring a reboot one for it to take effect now again

25:36.120 --> 25:40.800
Sousa and red hats are you okay? This is nothing new canonical is not the first to think of this

25:40.800 --> 25:46.240
Why should I care they're doing a couple of things really interesting first of all crazy easy to set up

25:46.240 --> 25:51.560
You do have to create an account on their thing, but it's really it's a it's it's a really interesting way

25:52.560 --> 25:56.880
It is a it is a clever take on setting up something as complicated as kernel live patching

25:56.880 --> 26:01.040
I'll just put it that way so I want to cover a couple of interesting things about it and a couple

26:01.280 --> 26:06.920
Limitations the live patch service is available for generic and low latency flavors of the 64-bit kernel

26:06.920 --> 26:12.160
Yeah, so you got to have x86 64 AMD 64 builds of Ubuntu 1604 LTS is kernel

26:12.920 --> 26:14.920
Which is 4.4?

26:15.200 --> 26:22.600
canonical live patches work on 1604 LTS servers and desktops on physical machines virtual machines and in the cloud the safety security and stability

26:22.720 --> 26:28.320
Firmly depends on unmodified Ubuntu kernels and network access because you got to connect to the service

26:28.960 --> 26:34.160
The ups this is why this is this is where they start to hint why I think they have the superior solution here

26:34.160 --> 26:37.120
This is the first hint of it the upstream Linux live patch

26:37.640 --> 26:44.140
Functionality upstream live patch functionality is currently limited to 64-bit x86 architecture at this time

26:44.440 --> 26:49.360
However, IBM is working on support for power 8 and system 390 mainframe

26:50.560 --> 26:54.360
Well, I guess they want that up to him and there's also active uptime development

26:55.200 --> 27:00.760
Upstream, I'm sorry development on arm 64. Hey, that's cool. Yeah, that could be big

27:00.760 --> 27:08.660
um, so that's where this is really different is this is an upstream thing that's already in kernel starting with kernel 4 4

27:08.820 --> 27:12.320
every live patch by canonical is rigorously they say tested in

27:13.320 --> 27:18.520
rigorously tested in canonicals in-house continuous integration continuous delivery system

27:18.520 --> 27:25.240
They do a quality assurance which tests hundreds of combinations of live patch kernels hardware and physical machines and virtual machines

27:25.240 --> 27:32.160
Well again, you are pushing out updates directly to people's kernels. So this has got to be that pretty seriously

27:32.160 --> 27:36.400
This is a whole nother level. They aren't willing to reboot. So they are taking this pretty serious, right?

27:36.400 --> 27:42.640
I mean if they're gonna trust your patches and and how how they do a little additional testing is interesting and I'm gonna get to that

27:42.640 --> 27:48.440
But let me just tell you about this the canonical live patch service is intended to address the high and critical severity Linux kernel

27:48.840 --> 27:53.440
Security vulnerabilities as identified by the Ubuntu security notices and the CVE databases

27:53.440 --> 27:55.960
We if you watch text now, we talk about this stuff all the time

27:55.960 --> 28:01.320
And so there's a certain level of CVE vulnerabilities and when they reach that they'll do live patches

28:01.320 --> 28:04.800
There are some limitations to the kernels live patching technology

28:04.960 --> 28:08.700
Some Linux kernel code paths cannot be safely patched while running

28:08.900 --> 28:13.960
They say they'll do their best to supply canonical live patches for high and critical vulnerabilities in a timely fashion

28:14.480 --> 28:22.280
Whenever possible there may be occasions when traditional kernel upgrades and reboots might still be necessary and they will communicate that through notifications

28:22.280 --> 28:24.080
so

28:24.080 --> 28:28.720
One question. Yes, do they have a catchy song advertising this service?

28:30.440 --> 28:34.660
Because I don't I mean, I don't know if I can I don't know if I can deal if they don't they it's funny because

28:35.320 --> 28:39.400
When they get to the comparison, that's one of the okay, I'll get there you're I'll get there

28:39.400 --> 28:44.000
But this is the this is the details. I think that applies most to people listening that aren't in the enterprise

28:44.080 --> 28:48.600
So if you're a home user or a small business, this is the stuff here. You're gonna care about

28:48.600 --> 28:52.040
you do need a subscription possibly and

28:53.160 --> 28:59.440
You definitely need an account the canonical live patch service provides a secure encrypted authenticated connection, which um

29:00.280 --> 29:04.880
Seems pretty necessary when you're live patching your kernel. Yeah, I'll just take any old bit stream. That's fine

29:04.880 --> 29:07.080
Throw it in the rain. Connect over HTTP. We're good

29:07.720 --> 29:15.400
To ensure that only properly signed live patch kernel modules and most importantly the right modules are delivered directly to your system with extreme quality and high testing

29:15.400 --> 29:18.600
They do have a subscription service if you have a lot of systems, but

29:20.600 --> 29:23.320
Canonical is providing the live patch service

29:24.760 --> 29:27.720
To community users of Ubuntu at no charge

29:28.360 --> 29:33.400
For up to three machines desktop servers virtual machines in cloud instances. Well, damn I got way more droplets in that

29:33.400 --> 29:38.040
Yes, but if you got up to three machines you can play with this live patch your house or that's your three critical servers

29:38.040 --> 29:42.840
No, maybe my three my three droplets. I never want to reboot but I want to keep them secure that actually

29:42.840 --> 29:46.600
Might work. The other thing is maybe you do it all, you know, you're using their fancy little XT thing

29:46.600 --> 29:51.000
You get three big container droplets and I run containers on those. Oh, man. Yeah

29:51.560 --> 29:55.640
And here's the other thing that I think is fascinating about the free mechanism

29:56.600 --> 30:02.520
Because this is also how canonical is sussing out if these patches are gonna blow your system up and this is I mean

30:03.400 --> 30:10.200
You interpret as you want, but they say a randomly chosen subset of the free users of canonicals live patch

30:10.200 --> 30:17.240
Will receive their canonical live patches slightly earlier than the rest of the free users or the subscription users

30:17.880 --> 30:19.640
as a lightweight

30:19.640 --> 30:21.640
Canary testing mechanism

30:22.120 --> 30:25.800
Benefiting benefiting all canonical live patch users

30:26.520 --> 30:33.000
So the free users some of them will randomly get selected to occasionally receive the updates before the other users

30:33.000 --> 30:36.200
That's gonna be you every time, you know what, you know what Chris that's you every time

30:36.200 --> 30:40.760
Ah, you know to be fair. This is pretty common. This is how Microsoft rollouts

30:41.320 --> 30:42.440
major

30:42.440 --> 30:48.600
Winders updates once uh, once they get enough data back to the canary live patches apply safely all canonical live patch users

30:49.160 --> 30:50.840
Receive their updates

30:50.840 --> 30:54.600
So that's do your part. Yeah, I guess a preloader. Yeah

30:55.720 --> 31:01.560
Okay, and then of course the big question what about the source what about the source the source code of live patch modules

31:01.560 --> 31:07.960
Is found here and we have it linked in the show notes that got that all published. The source of the canonical live patch client

31:08.680 --> 31:13.160
is part of canonicals landscape system management product and is

31:13.880 --> 31:15.640
commercial software

31:15.640 --> 31:20.200
I see now does the inner I don't think anyone in the enterprise gives one shit about that

31:21.720 --> 31:25.960
They have enterprise agreements to protect them referred to our topic later in the show about that

31:27.480 --> 31:29.480
Now the question is

31:29.480 --> 31:35.240
How does this compare to the stuff that oracle's doing to the stuff red hats doing to the stuff seuss is doing?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.560
The concepts are largely the same

31:38.280 --> 31:44.600
But the technical implementations and commercial terms are very different oracle's ksplice uses its own technology. It's not upstream, right?

31:45.640 --> 31:50.620
Reddit enterprise linux and seuss currently use their own homegrown kpatch and kgraph implementations retrospectively

31:51.380 --> 31:56.280
Canonicals live patching uses the upstream linux kernel live patching technology. That's awesome

31:56.280 --> 32:03.560
ksplice is free, but unsupported for ubuntu desktops and only available for oracle linux and red hat enterprise linux servers with

32:04.760 --> 32:09.480
An oracle linux premiere support license, which is 2300 a year a node

32:10.200 --> 32:11.720
Of course it is

32:11.720 --> 32:16.920
2300 a node. It's a little unclear how to subscribe to the red hat enterprise kernel live patching

32:16.920 --> 32:22.760
But it appears that you need to first be a red hat enterprise linux customer and then enroll in their special interest group through your

32:22.760 --> 32:29.080
Technical account manager, which you have to have one and which requires red enterprise linux server premium subscription

32:29.080 --> 32:31.400
Which is thirteen hundred dollars a node a year

32:32.360 --> 32:35.640
Wow, and then the seuss live patching is available as an add-on

32:36.600 --> 32:38.840
But to seuss linux enterprise server 12

32:39.560 --> 32:42.600
We have to get a priority priority support subscription at

32:43.640 --> 32:45.640
1500 dollars a node a year

32:45.800 --> 32:49.400
But you do get that free music video. Hey, yeah, so that's got to be worth something

32:49.400 --> 32:54.760
I mean, you're you're obviously relevant if you've got a music video. That's I mean look everybody they're relevant

32:55.240 --> 32:58.920
Uh, then canonical they still owe a lot of money to those the people that made that video

32:58.920 --> 33:02.360
That's where the subscription price comes from. So when you yeah, I gotta pay that out

33:02.680 --> 33:07.080
So, uh when you do decide if you decide to subscribe to the canonical live patch

33:07.080 --> 33:12.600
If you got more than three systems, you're paying 150 a node per year. Well, okay. Well, that's that's more reasonable

33:12.760 --> 33:16.760
Yeah, and presumably you have to care about these nodes enough that you can get a free subscription

33:16.760 --> 33:20.680
Yeah, and presumably you have to care about these nodes enough that you want a live patch, right?

33:20.680 --> 33:23.160
So if you have six systems, you could probably go make two accounts

33:23.960 --> 33:25.960
I'm not saying but you're just saying

33:25.960 --> 33:27.720
Yeah

33:27.720 --> 33:29.720
So this

33:31.240 --> 33:32.920
Seems to be

33:32.920 --> 33:34.200
a pretty

33:34.200 --> 33:37.960
Huge release from canonical even though a lot of people will dismiss it as

33:38.360 --> 33:42.200
Ah, that's that's been done before but I don't think it's been done like this

33:42.280 --> 33:45.720
I really think what they did is they waited for the upstream code to just have it

33:45.720 --> 33:49.480
Did right they didn't want to they didn't want to invent their own system. Yeah

33:50.040 --> 33:54.760
And which probably means that uh, you know anybody that's running 4.4 could probably invent their own

33:55.480 --> 33:57.080
method of doing this but

33:57.080 --> 34:00.680
I think this is a pretty competitive. I also think it's a you know, it's like it's not

34:01.400 --> 34:05.960
At least while it's competitive see how it used but I can definitely see in the future it getting thrown over the open source fence

34:06.440 --> 34:09.160
And then here's the other thing that I think it shows

34:09.160 --> 34:15.720
It shows why ubuntu is so much more popular on the cloud type vps instances

34:15.960 --> 34:18.760
Than susa or red hat enterprise linux, which you think about it

34:18.920 --> 34:24.760
It's almost a joke to suggest that you go buy a vps and run susa or red hat enterprise. Maybe centos for sure

34:24.920 --> 34:32.440
Yeah, totally, but susa enterprise linux or red hat enterprise linux, which are built for servers designed to run on 24 7 workloads

34:32.760 --> 34:35.240
It's a joke to think you go get a vps with one of those on there

34:35.240 --> 34:39.400
and you can find them but it like nobody does it no and and

34:40.200 --> 34:43.080
Why is that if you look at those prices that we just talked about?

34:43.160 --> 34:48.440
It's a if you if you decide to go with this on your production vps with ubuntu on there

34:48.520 --> 34:52.200
You likely did not a pay for the version of ubuntu that's on there and b

34:52.280 --> 34:56.360
You may not even have a support subscription and c if you decide to get this live patching

34:56.360 --> 35:02.440
It's 150 bucks versus 1500 bucks or 1300 bucks. I mean really so, uh

35:02.440 --> 35:09.480
Uh red hat would you'd have to get the you have to get the 2300 subscription from oracle and the and the 1300

35:09.640 --> 35:15.240
Subscription from red hat and with susa you have to get the 1500 subscription and only works on linux enterprise server 12

35:16.520 --> 35:18.520
geez

35:18.840 --> 35:19.960
And my

35:19.960 --> 35:26.360
Who knows but my gut tells me that likely the next lts will also support this so they'll do this for every lts

35:27.080 --> 35:31.160
And now you look at a system here that's sitting in production. I start thinking to myself. Why I wouldn't mind that

35:31.160 --> 35:33.160
I don't like rebooting these ever. Mm-hmm

35:34.040 --> 35:38.440
And 150 bucks. That's really not that much especially if it's only a couple and hey you get three free. Yeah

35:39.800 --> 35:43.480
Pretty neat anybody in the mumble room want to jump in before we move on

35:43.640 --> 35:49.320
I think does that wrap up our breaking? I think it's all the breaking news breaking news. Yeah, so that's

35:50.520 --> 35:57.000
That is it. Oh, actually, no, it's not there is one more and I won't do the soundboard because i've been obnoxious with it

35:57.000 --> 36:02.520
Um scraper you have a you have a uh, let's see scrappy paw. I'm not even sure what scrap job

36:02.680 --> 36:05.240
Scrap job you have a comment about reboots. Go ahead

36:06.920 --> 36:11.320
Yeah, you guys being in a studio that you only broadcast from you know once

36:11.800 --> 36:19.480
Uh, you know a day. I know you have live things that are running throughout 24 7, but wouldn't you shut down unused machines?

36:20.760 --> 36:22.760
You know you would think um

36:23.400 --> 36:25.400
the big issue is

36:25.400 --> 36:29.400
With hdmi video capture and god, I can't wait till we move away from hdmi

36:30.040 --> 36:35.000
There is a display port everywhere. I hope there is a there is like a

36:35.480 --> 36:39.720
sequence you have to go through for your capture and your output to see each other and

36:40.440 --> 36:44.920
It has to be timed just right and when you have multiple systems. So we have we have

36:45.480 --> 36:49.320
Three doing hdmi in and like we have like four or five hdmi outs

36:49.320 --> 36:57.640
five hdmi outs and they're just they're just a catastrophe to work with and so we generally what we do is we run the systems in

36:57.640 --> 37:01.720
Like a a low power mode where the display is still sending a signal

37:01.960 --> 37:05.640
But like the screens are off the hard drives are spun down or something like that

37:05.640 --> 37:08.680
but we leave them running 24 7 just because

37:09.640 --> 37:11.640
um

37:12.040 --> 37:16.600
The the schedule of doing daily productions and sometimes two shows a day is tight enough

37:16.600 --> 37:21.880
There's not quite enough room for troubleshooting that because sometimes troubleshooting that can take like 45 minutes to an hour

37:21.880 --> 37:25.560
And there are a lot of times where you're showing up here and then 10 minutes and you need to be on the air

37:25.560 --> 37:28.920
Every now and then that yeah that that does that does tend to happen from time to time most time

37:28.920 --> 37:31.720
I'm here before a show, but there have definitely been times where uh

37:32.760 --> 37:35.480
there was one time for tech talk today where uh

37:36.120 --> 37:38.760
Thank god for rikai because he's a miracle worker

37:38.760 --> 37:42.120
I I don't know. I don't know how he knew I wasn't just not coming in

37:42.120 --> 37:47.080
But somehow his beard spider sense was tingling and he knew that I was on the road

37:47.160 --> 37:50.760
But was not going to make it on time and I I legitimately don't know how he knew

37:50.920 --> 37:54.440
But he knew because it could have been I I guess because I don't ever just not show up

37:54.520 --> 37:57.080
I guess that's how he knew I guess he knew because I know I always make it

37:57.320 --> 38:00.840
And so he's like but he must have looked at the clock and said there's no way he's gonna get

38:01.080 --> 38:06.280
So he came down in the studio and got stuff going and I literally walked in the door and sat down and started the show

38:06.600 --> 38:09.080
And that was like the tightest it had ever been and it is wow

38:09.080 --> 38:12.680
And if there's any outage right there, I spend the first half hour of the show

38:13.080 --> 38:18.840
Troubleshooting that and then i'm all you're grumpy. I am wrecked. I'm wrecked by the end of that. I'm wrecked

38:19.160 --> 38:21.160
So yeah, and you don't want to start a show all wrecked. No

38:21.960 --> 38:25.640
Okay, so we do have one more break. Yeah, okay. This is cnn breaking news

38:26.440 --> 38:29.560
This is something I think i'll be using in the near near future me too

38:30.280 --> 38:36.760
This is really cool. It's a new tool that lets you easily install ubuntu touch os on your mobile device

38:36.760 --> 38:39.100
It's a tool developed by marius

38:39.640 --> 38:42.600
Quebec marius marius. What do you think on that last name?

38:44.040 --> 38:48.440
Quebec yeah, I don't know. Yeah, okay, and it's called the magic dash device dash tool

38:49.720 --> 38:56.680
Magic device tool the first stable version magic device dash tool 1.0 is now available to everyone and promises

38:57.080 --> 38:58.040
an

38:58.040 --> 39:04.040
Very simple and easy to use batch tool for installing canonicals ubuntu touch as well as android

39:04.040 --> 39:09.420
Cyanogen mod or phoenix os so it's not just an ubuntu touch tool

39:09.900 --> 39:14.060
You'll be able to replace your mobile operating system on your device with any of the following. Cyanogen. Okay

39:14.060 --> 39:16.700
I just said all that. I don't know why they repeat that. Oh, oh, oh, there is one caveat

39:16.700 --> 39:21.020
I wanted to know about though. They don't support the versions of images that have the google apps

39:21.660 --> 39:22.780
Okay

39:22.780 --> 39:27.180
So here's the devices though. This is what matters the bq queries e 4.5

39:27.180 --> 39:34.700
The bq queries e5 hd bq queries m10 bq queries m10 fhd etc. So the us mx pro mu is pro 5

39:35.340 --> 39:39.740
Now we're starting to cook with gas though. The nexus 4 the nexus 5

39:40.380 --> 39:41.660
nexus 7

39:41.660 --> 39:49.540
2013 Wi-Fi the nexus 7 2013 LTE the nexus 7 2012 3g the nexus 10 the one plus and the fair phone

39:50.820 --> 39:52.820
To may not work

39:53.500 --> 39:57.020
You don't think so. Well, that's what that says. Oh does it just at the bottom there?

39:57.020 --> 39:58.780
Oh the fair point to you

39:58.780 --> 40:05.500
That's okay. I don't think that's probably no, it's not a nexus 5 though. That's a big deal. Also the nexus 7

40:05.500 --> 40:07.420
I've always wanted to do it on that

40:07.420 --> 40:12.260
But I just don't have the time and this thing and also it can do backups here of your machine. It can do

40:12.940 --> 40:20.060
Restorations it can unlock or lock the bootloader and it also supports installing the TW RP recovery image

40:20.460 --> 40:26.980
This is amazing. Yep, you know, I've seen some similar tools for Windows that I think it's a it's a nice new

40:26.980 --> 40:30.180
niche for people where it's like well, maybe you flash your phone or need to do this like

40:31.100 --> 40:36.540
Once maybe a year and so if you're not like ready to jump down in the ADB shell or any of that

40:36.540 --> 40:40.200
Here's a handy tool that you can use to do that or honestly for me

40:40.200 --> 40:41.980
It's it's not that I haven't used ADB

40:41.980 --> 40:45.160
But I haven't used ADB in so long that I would I would spend enough time

40:45.420 --> 40:49.860
Googling around and reading XDA forms that I just don't want to spend that time

40:50.380 --> 40:55.740
This thing already knows how to do it. That's what I really want is the end result. I don't I don't really care

40:55.740 --> 41:00.420
You're not developing for Android. You're not making it. Yeah. Yeah, I'm that guy. I'm that guy

41:00.420 --> 41:02.820
I I admit it when it comes to this kind of stuff

41:02.820 --> 41:07.380
I'm that guy, but I think this is a super positive development and it's a tool all the I think

41:07.700 --> 41:11.180
My pixel gets here. I'll be using this and that's trying out a bunch of

41:12.500 --> 41:14.500
Did I did which one?

41:14.900 --> 41:20.100
I got the smaller one. Oh, yeah, good call. I mean it just seemed I don't have huge hands

41:20.100 --> 41:22.820
It's all about you keep it in your pocket. Do you keep it? That's what it's about

41:22.820 --> 41:27.140
I got a 4.7 inch phone now and I'm all about that. It's in my pocket right now

41:27.140 --> 41:29.940
I didn't even know I had to feel I had to touch my pocket comfortable

41:29.940 --> 41:33.860
I've literally been sitting here for how long I didn't even know that phones in my pocket. That's what I'm talking about

41:33.860 --> 41:39.980
See the 6p. It's a brick dude. Totally. So that's interesting. Did you get the 128? I did I did

41:39.980 --> 41:41.980
I'm I don't know if I'll need it or not

41:42.140 --> 41:46.120
But so we plan to have the phone for when it wouldn't they say when did you say you're getting it?

41:46.660 --> 41:49.960
Because I went for the 128. I don't get it till like mid-november

41:49.960 --> 41:55.200
So a month or so, that's rough. Yeah, it's rough mid-november, huh?

41:55.880 --> 41:57.880
Geez, yeah

41:57.880 --> 42:03.040
There have you read me the reviews that came out today? Yeah, that's positive. They're positive. Yeah, I

42:03.880 --> 42:09.720
Think I think it's the Android phone to get right now if you're gonna get an Android phone. Mm-hmm, and

42:10.800 --> 42:13.600
And I need a new phone and yeah, you do it

42:13.600 --> 42:20.000
It's nice enough. Not only do you have a Nexus 5 but you your phone is busted the app. It is bad

42:20.000 --> 42:23.600
Well, I've been waiting for this scratch yourself with that. Yeah, thankfully now

42:24.200 --> 42:30.040
But it is dangerous. It is definitely dangerous. That's probably may explode. It's made by LG, but it may explode

42:30.040 --> 42:32.680
You also are constantly charging that thing of notice. That's true

42:32.680 --> 42:39.360
And that's one of the things that come back on the early news is by the way user air 7 just came out where we gave

42:39.360 --> 42:43.000
You our full take on the pixel if you are interested as well as the app

42:43.000 --> 42:48.520
Absolute very best way to get great audio on Linux

42:48.520 --> 42:54.360
We talked about that and a few other tidbits that I think are actually I think it was a really good episode of user

42:54.360 --> 42:59.120
I decided to listen to it user air 7 is out where we do talk about the pixel so I cannot wait to try it out

42:59.120 --> 43:03.080
I'm kind of on the fence myself. I think I'm gonna let things go for a while

43:03.080 --> 43:08.200
I'm good when you're in a position, you know, if you have a good phone that you like, it's not necessarily worthwhile

43:08.200 --> 43:15.560
Also, I am I am personally until I am proven. Otherwise, I am an avid believer in optical image stabilization

43:15.880 --> 43:22.920
I know that they have incredible post-processing but physically having a lens that floats I think is unbeatable

43:22.920 --> 43:25.480
And so when pictures are a big part of it

43:25.480 --> 43:29.880
I know it's got a great camera and a great sensor and so they say and the reviews do seem to back that up

43:30.400 --> 43:36.000
But it does lack actual optical image stabilization that to me in 2016 nearly

43:36.000 --> 43:40.880
2017 it's gonna be your phone in 2017. That's a bit of a yeah, that's a bit of a

43:41.520 --> 43:45.040
Bummer, I guess we'll see we can do some photo shoots here in the studio

43:45.040 --> 43:50.360
Yeah, I mean so far the reviews have been pretty good and loved and the video they say it really is impressive

43:50.920 --> 43:52.840
So yeah, you know what? Why don't we take a moment?

43:52.840 --> 43:57.600
And why don't we thank our sponsor ting go over to ting dot actually, you know what?

43:57.600 --> 43:59.640
I can't believe it. I almost just I almost well

43:59.640 --> 44:07.120
I almost forgot to say you can put Linux in your Linux Linux not ting.com Linux not ting.com is not only good a good way

44:07.120 --> 44:11.280
To support the show, but it'll give you $25 off a device or if you bring a device like a pixel

44:12.000 --> 44:13.960
They'll give you $25 in service credit

44:13.960 --> 44:19.160
I would really consider this if you're gonna get the pixel too because tings no contract nor the termination fee and

44:19.720 --> 44:22.640
You only pay for what you use

44:22.640 --> 44:27.760
That's really the secret sauce to ting is if you can be kind of clever if you can download your podcasts

44:27.760 --> 44:31.320
Over Wi-Fi or what I do on Spotify at Spotify on my phone

44:31.320 --> 44:36.240
But I download the tracks on Wi-Fi and they play them offline because I like the super crazy extreme quality

44:36.240 --> 44:38.440
Anyways, I can I so I just use that

44:38.440 --> 44:45.120
I just there's just like really four or five things you can do differently and you can save so much money with ting

44:45.120 --> 44:45.400
Yes

44:45.400 --> 44:51.520
They just take your minutes your messages and your megabytes and they add them all up and whatever it is at the end of the month

44:51.560 --> 44:53.560
That's all you have to pay

44:53.560 --> 45:00.280
Ting keeps rates simple. We don't make you pick a plan instead. You just use your phone as you normally would how much you use

45:00.580 --> 45:04.960
Determines how much you pay each month. You can have as many devices as you want on one account

45:05.120 --> 45:05.920
That's good

45:05.920 --> 45:10.120
Because when you use more you pay less per minute message or megabyte of data

45:10.320 --> 45:15.320
Your usage plus six dollars per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill

45:16.040 --> 45:18.280
Simple that's what we mean when we say

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Mobile that makes sense

45:22.000 --> 45:29.200
They also have incredible customer service and a fantastic dashboard you get to speak to a real human being when you call customer service

45:29.200 --> 45:30.660
You're not playing that game

45:30.660 --> 45:35.140
And if you do end up with something like the pixel from the Play Store, you can get a ting sim card for $9

45:35.480 --> 45:39.180
You just put it in there you activate it. There's no contract nor the termination fee. Try it out

45:39.440 --> 45:43.840
See how it works for you. Why not? Give it a go. In fact, I don't know

45:43.840 --> 45:44.780
I haven't looked at the pixel

45:44.780 --> 45:49.480
But I bet you could choose CDMA or GSM because things got both networks and if the pixels out of your

45:49.480 --> 45:55.160
Price range because cheese it is an expensive. Oh, yes. I mean I bought two. Did you really offer a lady one, too?

45:55.160 --> 46:00.960
Yeah, yeah. Yeah boy. I mean and that's nice for charging and all that kind of stuff. That's a huge thing

46:00.960 --> 46:05.160
All you can see in USBC household. Yeah, I can understand the future

46:05.160 --> 46:05.480
Yeah

46:05.480 --> 46:09.940
If you want to save some cash ting has our semi recent blog post from the 11th about five wise

46:10.080 --> 46:12.040
smartphone choices that are under

46:12.040 --> 46:16.000
$200 so if you still want to get a big smartphone that has some functionality that's gonna get some updates

46:16.000 --> 46:19.760
Maybe has a nice camera. They've got a post about that, too. So that's and that's

46:20.040 --> 46:23.080
Super nice because you can either bring your device or grab a device directly from Ting

46:23.080 --> 46:24.680
It's all I just make it so easy

46:24.680 --> 46:29.800
Linux dot ting comm and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

46:29.880 --> 46:31.880
So do you remember a couple of weeks ago?

46:31.880 --> 46:35.780
There were some headlines where Linux they went essentially like this Linus

46:36.240 --> 46:39.840
admits that Linux 4.8 had buggy crap and

46:40.040 --> 46:45.300
He raged against it saying there was no effing excuse to knowingly kill a running colonel

46:45.300 --> 46:48.720
And he talks about how he it was his bad

46:49.160 --> 46:54.720
For taking some patches from Andrew right before the 4.8 released. You remember all of this West does this ring about?

46:54.720 --> 46:57.160
Yeah, I believe we touched on it here on this show just a little bit

46:57.160 --> 47:01.760
so what I want to do is I want to take a moment and I want to go a little bit deeper and talk about what

47:01.760 --> 47:09.060
They're actually discussing here because this turns out to be a topic that is now giving a lot of Linux critics

47:09.400 --> 47:11.400
some serious fodder and

47:11.400 --> 47:18.080
If you heard this you would think oh jeez if you if you're not familiar with intimate details you might think she's

47:18.720 --> 47:22.000
What the hell is Linus doing you know this is Linus

47:22.000 --> 47:26.380
He's raging out once again, and he's acting out of emotion, and he's bad press for the Linux kernel

47:26.380 --> 47:29.940
Yeah, and it's it's I don't know a lot about this West, but I got some clips

47:29.940 --> 47:32.000
I want to play you've had some time to think about it

47:32.000 --> 47:38.720
It's about this bug underscore on that led to the Linux kernel stopping and we've got a post

47:38.720 --> 47:43.660
linked in the show notes by Samsung's open-source group that say that they

47:44.020 --> 47:49.260
They are working this is something they're working on they say it's a top priority for Linus to to change this bug

47:49.380 --> 47:52.500
What are we talking about West? What do we what is bug on? What are we talking about?

47:53.660 --> 47:55.660
bug on is a

47:55.700 --> 47:57.700
kernel function or macro that

47:59.220 --> 48:02.780
At least in some ways is used when is when you see you know when you see a

48:02.780 --> 48:08.780
Kernel bug where you're in a position where and this is something they talk about in this in this thread as we'll talk about

48:08.980 --> 48:13.640
You know when the kernels in a position where it there's no meaningful error recovery it right now

48:13.780 --> 48:17.380
There's a current trend where it gets used a lot by kernel developers in development

48:17.580 --> 48:19.420
So it's a kind of like in other terms

48:19.420 --> 48:22.380
It's similar to like an assert statement where you're basically saying like well at this point

48:22.940 --> 48:27.780
Everything that I'm doing this should be true if it's not true, then it's violating one of my assumptions going forward

48:27.780 --> 48:31.580
It doesn't make sense to continue because you know my axioms have been violated

48:31.580 --> 48:33.580
It

48:33.660 --> 48:37.060
Gets used a lot as an development when you haven't written error code

48:37.060 --> 48:40.660
You don't know what error code to write yet. You're exploring basically this triggers like oh well

48:40.660 --> 48:45.620
The my new feature clearly didn't work crash the kernel we get a stack trace you can begin debugging

48:46.580 --> 48:52.300
Sometimes this does then go through into the the real kernel and it does have a place and then part of why I think this

48:52.300 --> 48:56.340
Thread is interesting is it's kind of you get to see the discussion of like yeah, when should this be used?

48:56.340 --> 49:02.380
When do we crash the kernel and so it's sort of a discussion around should it be easy to crash the kernel because really

49:03.260 --> 49:07.380
You know and and Linus is I think in a good way concerned about I mean

49:07.660 --> 49:09.540
It's not like stupid

49:09.540 --> 49:10.740
bragging uptime concerns

49:10.740 --> 49:16.140
But there's lots of places like do you remember the bad press during when Windows 10 rollout when those there was like hospitals in Africa

49:16.140 --> 49:20.620
Or other places where their machines were rebooted. So I was you know problems were caused their situations

49:20.980 --> 49:23.540
Not in the data center where you don't want to go down

49:23.540 --> 49:26.660
Or you won't want to go to the admin to be able to choose to go down yeah

49:26.660 --> 49:30.460
And so you know they're very concerned about if there's anything we can do to avoid a situation

49:30.460 --> 49:33.620
You know by all means if you're the file system code

49:33.620 --> 49:37.540
And you can't you know you're gonna write damaged data to the drive stop what you're doing

49:37.540 --> 49:41.140
But it doesn't also in that case it might not mean that you absolutely have to crash the whole kernel

49:41.140 --> 49:45.920
So this is what's fascinating about this particular issue because what you just said there seems

49:46.100 --> 49:52.480
Absolutely reasonable to me and seems like a likely use case scenario for Linux is number one deployment, which is the server

49:52.480 --> 49:57.440
However Linux critics have taken this and spun this as well

49:57.440 --> 50:01.600
This is Linus sick and tired of bugs crashing his buggy kernel

50:01.600 --> 50:04.780
And they are just paper machine over the problem

50:04.780 --> 50:10.040
and they're just suppressing the issue and if you watch this at this week's episode of BSC now a

50:10.880 --> 50:14.680
Popular guest Brian Cantrell was on and they talked about this very issue

50:14.920 --> 50:20.480
Brian is I I love every episode of BSC comes in it really is because he is

50:20.480 --> 50:26.720
He is such a great Linux critic because he really sticks it and he's so outspoken. I love watching him

50:26.720 --> 50:29.660
He's very opinionated. He's often right on the money. He's a

50:30.240 --> 50:36.440
Terribly smart guy yeah, and so he tears in to this particular issue on this week's episode of BSC now

50:36.440 --> 50:39.160
I fully recommend you watch the entire interview

50:39.160 --> 50:42.780
We're gonna play like two minutes from a much longer interview

50:42.780 --> 50:47.960
But this is him talking about them switching over from this bug on to something

50:47.960 --> 50:52.640
less dramatic that doesn't stop the kernel and this is what's becoming the sort of

50:53.280 --> 50:55.840
external community take on this particular issue and

50:57.180 --> 50:59.180
Music

50:59.320 --> 51:02.280
Sharp objects away from you. They are going to use like I know

51:02.840 --> 51:06.240
Said can fix this bug. Yes said did not fix this bug

51:06.240 --> 51:13.120
So they're gonna change every bug on to worn on it's like there I fixed it. It's like

51:13.120 --> 51:21.040
Okay, and so now if you actually have a Linux kernel programmer that has I mean

51:21.760 --> 51:26.760
The the poor right-thinking individual that is living in the ghetto of Linux

51:26.760 --> 51:33.080
Just trying to do the right thing and has an actual legit bug on if this happens

51:33.080 --> 51:39.280
Please panic the system that is now just gonna be turned into a worn on and now you've actually

51:39.280 --> 51:46.640
Introduced bugs effectively in systems or certainly made any bugs that do exist in the subsystems much more difficult to debug

51:46.640 --> 51:48.360
It's like how do you come on?

51:48.360 --> 51:52.560
I mean, aren't you old enough to I mean like Torvalds and I are about the same age

51:52.560 --> 51:56.520
Like but do you still have this many hormones running through you that you think this is a good idea?

51:56.520 --> 52:00.840
I mean, don't you realize that I mean aren't we getting older and wiser but you know, whatever

52:01.320 --> 52:03.800
Say worn on with butter FS what could possibly?

52:03.800 --> 52:13.360
I do love the I got the whole like the system D will recover

52:18.160 --> 52:23.040
Chris there comes a point where it's just like you're clearly you're just piling on here. You're just sorry

52:24.040 --> 52:26.080
Like can I actually make him pass out?

52:26.080 --> 52:29.240
I mean you buy you two things for a game are you gonna see if you can actually yeah

52:29.240 --> 52:31.240
I think we have a betting game on the side

52:31.240 --> 52:36.080
I mean, I see how long before we can make central stroke out life

52:38.320 --> 52:40.160
My vision is kind of fading right now

52:40.160 --> 52:45.080
So he's so frustrated with Linux that he's about to he's about to stroke out

52:45.080 --> 52:50.720
And so you could hear a couple of a couple of assumptions that he's working from and it's not just Brian

52:51.440 --> 52:56.280
Brian is is just a sort of representing an opinion that is forming and

52:56.280 --> 53:01.080
I I wanted to address a couple of assumptions that I think he's working from when he makes these statements

53:01.600 --> 53:05.160
you might have noticed that in his world Linus the man is

53:05.720 --> 53:11.800
Irrational and makes code commits based on his emotions or as he put it his hormones not rational code commits

53:11.880 --> 53:17.160
Which I think is probably not the correct assumption to make but if you if you believe that to be a fact

53:17.200 --> 53:22.520
You could see how he's built a foundation of some an assumption there another assumption that kind of crops up

53:22.520 --> 53:29.040
In his and you'll hear another example here is everyone working on Linux basically kind of just doing it their own way

53:29.040 --> 53:31.040
they're doing it for fun and

53:31.200 --> 53:36.240
It kind of ignores the fact that the vast majority of commits to Linux are from business enterprise

53:36.640 --> 53:39.600
Developers who are getting paid by their company. They're serious people

53:40.440 --> 53:43.640
And I want it before we completely respond

53:43.640 --> 53:48.100
I want to I want to talk about this particular aspect the way this kind of gets spun and becomes

53:48.800 --> 53:51.000
becomes the reality of the situation and

53:51.000 --> 53:57.320
He continues to talk about sort of the pervasive bad thinking that's in Linux that led to things like butter FS

53:57.320 --> 54:00.320
And I want to talk about that too. Did you before we go to that?

54:00.320 --> 54:04.480
Did you want to interject on the on his on his take on the bug on thing?

54:06.280 --> 54:13.360
Well, I think him highlighting the said point there they do mention that that is mentioned by a contributor

54:13.840 --> 54:19.920
But they what what Linus says that's not that implementation that they would go with and then there's some debate about how it's used

54:19.920 --> 54:21.920
but I think what's really missed is just

54:22.920 --> 54:27.960
That the culture has not been using bug on and in this case, it's VM bug on as

54:28.680 --> 54:33.760
A like oh, no, we you know, like we messed up the CPU stack and we need to crash

54:33.760 --> 54:36.000
So it's not it hasn't been used in the situation

54:36.000 --> 54:39.540
So and what Linus is really concerned about here is like minimizing that right?

54:39.540 --> 54:43.120
And so like the issue is is that once something went out at scale and production

54:43.120 --> 54:49.060
It got used in a different way than they intended and this one in particular crept by in like an RC 8 patch level, right?

54:49.060 --> 54:54.520
So it's like it wasn't during the regular merge window. It didn't get all the regular testing it should have and like it's okay, right?

54:54.520 --> 55:01.520
Yes, there are times. Yeah, he admitted it. It's probably his mistake and I think what he's just saying is that it's really it's it's a

55:01.520 --> 55:05.760
Discussion now about like what are the semantics of crashing the kernel?

55:06.160 --> 55:11.120
We we should probably make it so that the developer like it doesn't get confused with how you debug

55:11.120 --> 55:14.440
It doesn't get confused with if you had heard that criticism on its surface

55:14.440 --> 55:19.680
From an intelligent person like Brian. I I would think cod Linux is really falling apart, right?

55:19.680 --> 55:20.840
I mean Brian has great credentials

55:20.840 --> 55:26.640
He's a super smart guy and he's a joint and I think his argument is right in that like no you should I mean you

55:26.640 --> 55:30.400
Should have asserts right? You should have what I think in Solaris. He says it's verified

55:31.200 --> 55:36.280
You should have these things that say like, you know, if if the kernel memory algorithms are working correctly

55:36.280 --> 55:41.720
This is this and if it's not we need to crash and Linux does have those and this is a conversation about where do you?

55:41.720 --> 55:44.640
Set that level and what are the semantics of crashing? I also

55:45.200 --> 55:49.520
I mean, I love all I love I love Alan and Chris and and I think Brian's great, too

55:49.760 --> 55:51.600
but I love it when they when they

55:51.600 --> 55:54.000
Poke fun at system D because I don't feel like it

55:54.000 --> 55:57.240
I don't even need to respond to that cuz what I'm gonna do is is like a tiger

55:57.240 --> 56:00.760
I'm gonna I'm gonna sit back and watch my prey and I'm gonna watch them

56:00.960 --> 56:05.440
Take shots at system D for the next couple of years and mark my words five years from now

56:05.560 --> 56:10.760
BSD will be fully rolling out their system D equivalent. They won't don't call it that they will be they'll make sure not to call

56:10.760 --> 56:14.300
It that yeah, but the reality is system D

56:15.680 --> 56:17.880
Despite what we might like to think in the Linux community

56:18.920 --> 56:22.320
Not a new idea. No, no, it's not Sun was working on

56:23.560 --> 56:28.480
Is it SMF SMF? Yeah. Yeah, and of course Apple had launch D. Mm-hmm

56:28.480 --> 56:35.000
And I remember using launch D can configure services before system D was even a thing. Yeah. Hey, this is pretty sweet

56:35.000 --> 56:41.160
I believe there are two if not three projects in the BSD community already to replicate system D like functionality

56:41.160 --> 56:43.160
It's just none of them are necessarily mainstream

56:43.960 --> 56:44.840
It's coming

56:44.840 --> 56:50.520
So just as it just sit back as a tiger and watch your prey as they poke poke fun at system D now and then when

56:50.520 --> 56:53.760
They will roll it out and all the all of the logical backflips

56:53.760 --> 56:59.040
They'll have to do to explain why it's nothing like system D. So but let's go on about the pervasive bad thinking in Linux

56:59.040 --> 57:02.800
This is a common. This is a common BSD culture

57:02.800 --> 57:08.160
Projection on the Linux community that Brian manages to put in really great summed up words

57:08.160 --> 57:11.840
And so this is a great point to sort of look at something that I think is a common misconception

57:12.600 --> 57:14.280
No, they actually won't

57:14.280 --> 57:19.640
And the other thing I think that is that is that is actively happening to Linux

57:19.640 --> 57:25.560
I think this is the kind of the peril that they run is that right thinking individuals are not attracted to that culture

57:25.560 --> 57:29.300
I don't think he means like politically right? I think he means right brain

57:29.300 --> 57:33.640
They're talking about right-brained people earlier in this so right brain versus left brain

57:33.640 --> 57:38.120
The the thing is he's saying is that Linux doesn't attract the right type of critical thinkers

57:38.400 --> 57:43.160
right thinking individuals are not attracted to that culture and so

57:43.760 --> 57:47.400
People even if you're interested in file systems, are you gonna go in your?

57:47.920 --> 57:54.920
22 are you gonna go work on butter of us? Are you gonna go work on ZFS if you are interested in operating systems?

57:54.920 --> 58:00.760
Are you going to go to a culture that is replacing bug-ons with worn-ons?

58:00.760 --> 58:04.400
Are you gonna go to the BSDs or to a Lumos or what have you where you got?

58:05.560 --> 58:09.920
Cultures that are not just more innovative but also more rigorous than they're thinking

58:09.920 --> 58:12.200
Yeah, so cultures are subjective for the eye of the beholder

58:12.240 --> 58:15.880
But if I'm 22 years old and I want to get a career in this field

58:15.880 --> 58:19.360
I'm probably gonna go with the platform that has the demonstra

58:19.360 --> 58:25.160
Just on German. What is the word demonstrably demonstrably larger deployment in the server space?

58:25.200 --> 58:30.240
That's what I'm trying to say. I mean think about it. If you if you want an employable skill, it's obvious

58:30.240 --> 58:31.000
The choice is obvious

58:31.000 --> 58:38.600
So I kind of disagree with the premise to begin with but his core his core message is the way the culture is the professionalism

58:39.960 --> 58:44.040
That's more appealing in BSD and people that think that way or a Lumos

58:44.040 --> 58:51.800
Yeah, or a Lumos which is which is his baby interested in operating systems. Are you going to go to a culture that is

58:52.320 --> 58:57.600
Replacing bug-ons with worn-ons or are you going to go to the BSDs or to a Lumos or what have you where you got?

58:58.760 --> 59:05.560
Cultures that are not just more innovative but also more rigorous than they're thinking and I think that you know in an all-open-source world

59:05.560 --> 59:12.560
There's total freedom of choice for technologists and the differentiators become almost the the cultures and these cultures become

59:12.560 --> 59:19.360
Self-perpetuating and so they I think there's there's a danger that you end up with with butter offenses over and over and over again

59:19.360 --> 59:26.720
Yeah, and I mean I just wonder how many of these is it gonna take before people kind of like connect the dots that okay

59:28.200 --> 59:32.520
Let's talk about that point how many times we have gonna screw something up before we admit

59:33.480 --> 59:38.960
That sometimes we just we think that there's bad ideas and we should just move on. I think he's kind of right

59:38.960 --> 59:44.080
I think you still have butter fs defenders out there who are gonna argue with this very moment in this show

59:44.080 --> 59:44.400
Yeah

59:44.400 --> 59:48.680
Even though it's so obvious to everybody else watching from like a distance

59:48.960 --> 59:53.960
That if you're an enterprise and you have serious data needs you're not going to deploy butter fs

59:53.960 --> 59:59.560
That system is worked out to be for yeah, and it has enabled an entire product category for some companies out there

59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.000
I will say it is interesting though. Just given Facebook's use of it. It is probably has a

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.520
Comparable number of deployments now. It's just that it's not for data. It's not for data reliability

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:14.280
You know, what are we going off with that Facebook thing though? I mean, I'm not if you're right if you're right

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:19.800
Then that probably is a massive deployment. But here's what I've heard. I've heard

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:27.160
Several things I've heard that that story is old and out of date trip. I've also heard that those systems run on RAM

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.760
The storage is RAM based the RAM disks and they wipe them every 24 hours. I

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:39.120
Could see that as well. So I I mean, oh no, and I'm not I'm not trying to argue for butter fs as a

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.600
Data storage solution, but that was always our go-to about our fast like well Facebook true

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.600
We had that we had that that was our go-to

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:52.680
But I don't actually know how much that holds up and I mean you don't see a huge number of patches these days or

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:55.320
that much improvement

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.400
But here's where I really think he starts to make a better point

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:05.080
he really kind of nails it when he talks about the the fundamental issue that I always had with butter fs and I couldn't put

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.080
into words as well as Brian does here is

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.480
It butter fs should have been production-ready

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:17.800
From the beginning it didn't have to be feature complete, but it should have been production-ready

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:19.840
cultures become

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.800
Self-perpetuating and so they I think there's there's a danger that you end up with with butter fesses over and over and over again

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:32.840
Yeah, and I I mean I just wonder how many of these is it gonna take before people kind of like connect the dots that there's

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.680
Actually something there are broader differences than simply the technology

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.080
Befuddled me was how they didn't catch this sooner

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:45.400
Because the test case they did for it if you know create the raid Zed and like DD zeros into one of the drives and then

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.040
run a scrub

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:52.780
Right free BSD handbook has every news NFS user do that on purpose to watch

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:55.660
To show them how a scrub works and repairs the data

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.620
Like right our newbie guide has every user

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:06.900
Do that exact experiment to prove that ZFS works and no one had ever done it with butter fs ever

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:10.020
What?

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:14.460
Well, and I think that this is the idea well you wouldn't do it because it's not ready for production yet

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:18.260
It's like yeah, it would be mean to do that because it's not it's like no

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.580
That's just setting us up for failure when also that doesn't it doesn't understand

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:27.340
What software is is born ready for production or not?

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:31.560
And if you the software that is especially software in the data path

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:36.900
It's not you don't make it ready for production later. It's like security

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:43.020
you don't retrofit it on to an extant system you either design it for production use or

01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.660
you don't and

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:48.900
It's not something that you as methodically approach

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:54.940
Yes, there will be bugs in the system, but the bugs in a system that that is actually designed for production use

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.860
That is actually a salvageable system bugs in a system

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:03.660
That was never actually designed for production use or thought that production use something that would be done later or by the little people

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:11.140
It is not actually tenable and with ZFS ZFS was people don't realize this that ZFS was designed

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.420
To be used in production from day zero

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:20.020
So it's it just that it didn't have features in the beginning so I think that's a pretty fair point actually

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:25.060
And I think the the lesson learned from butter FS is a change in our perspective

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:29.540
Let's not wait for something to be production ready. It's just it's not

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.660
1997 anymore

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:34.940
we're just in a different we're in a different world now when it comes to this stuff and

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:41.740
Like it or not. How serious is used right? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and it's happening on people's laptop

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:47.380
It's happening on people's phones and it's happening on people's servers if you want to if you want to follow more episode

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.780
163 of the BSC now program the return of the control right episode

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:55.000
It was actually it was your suggestion because you'd watch and said we should talk about this

01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:01.620
So thanks for thanks for the suggestion because I actually think it's good to talk about our weaknesses

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:05.180
Oh, yeah, absolutely, and it's good to be completely honest

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:10.220
But at the same time we do need to call it when people are maybe spreading a little bit of FUD

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:15.520
Especially around that bug on thing. That's just that's just fun. If you follow it closely enough, that's just straight-up fun

01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:21.660
Yeah, you want to criticize you want to criticize us as a community about butter fs and say that maybe the culture of Linux

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.700
Allows projects like butter fs to succeed

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:31.260
Okay, maybe that just sounds like a really active vibrant huge worldwide community

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.220
That's just many factors larger than the BSD community

01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:37.540
Well and ignores other subsystem communities as well as you know

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:42.660
I mean, it's not like we haven't had successful production file systems before and it's not that we won't have them again

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:48.740
But and we so we need the realistic criticism as well as an up-to-date assessment of the and it's not like you can't get see

01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:50.300
You can't you can get ZFS right now

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:55.660
It's like that's not the the reality is Linux is such a natural force in the technology

01:04:55.660 --> 01:05:00.380
industry that if you want your product to be relevant on the server, it has to work on Linux and

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:04.900
That even is true for ZFS

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.180
But it was a really good interview and there's a lot of good stuff they talk about and

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:14.380
I hope to have some of this very discussion with Brian in person at meet BSD. Oh, hey

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:19.740
Yeah, he's good. I think he's gonna be there the whole more about this the whole BSD now crew Alan's gonna be down there

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.260
Chris Moore is gonna be down there

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:27.260
Producer q5 sis is gonna be down there. I mean like it's a it's a full

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.060
BSD

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:32.500
Now crew plus Brian's gonna be there and

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.020
I'm gonna be there. It's November 11th or the 12th

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:40.020
Here's what I decided to do. This is I haven't I have not mentioned this yet on any shows

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:44.580
But I've gotten a few emails about it. I've got a couple of tweets about it people like hey

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.140
can we meet up while you're in the San Francisco area and

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:50.340
We really had this tight

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:54.980
Hadeah and I we plan to be there for the 11th and the 12th and then the other time was spent driving from

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:58.980
Washington and back and it was her idea. She said you know what? Why don't we just

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:02.020
Let's just take a couple extra days. I'll take a couple of days off from work

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:07.060
Maybe Noah can fill it on a show and let's spend a little time down there and let's let's meet up with some folks

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:11.780
So I will probably be also be in in the area the following Monday or Tuesday

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:16.500
And what I plan to do is I'll get down there. I'll get me BSD get my head around that and then I'm gonna start

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:21.380
Tweeting out what my plans are if you're in the San Francisco area and want to meet up email me Chris at Jupiter

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:26.100
Broadcasting comm or tweet me even better at Chris LAS. Let's start talking about sounds like a good idea

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:31.220
That sounds awesome because I kind of what I want it what I would like to do is maybe rent a car or maybe Ben

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:34.420
I'll let me let borrow his car an extra day if maybe and

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:40.500
Drive into San Francisco and just hang out and maybe people could show me some cool places and

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.460
Maybe we'll shoot a little rover log and all that kind of stuff

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:46.820
I think it could be a lot of fun. So I'm gonna take a couple extra days

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:48.900
Just you know, we have a lot of viewers

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:53.860
We have a lot we have thousands and thousands of viewers in the California area in the specific area

01:06:53.860 --> 01:07:01.860
It's and so if you're in if you've ever wanted to see Chris last in person and maybe maybe show me your favorite place to eat

01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:04.180
Maybe I'll do like a tour. I'll go Alden Brown

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:05.860
I'll just like I'll go around drink like

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:11.860
Coffees from all different places and have donuts and just get like all kinds of grub on and then record all for the rover log

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:15.460
That could be fun. And I think I think I'm gonna be there Monday or Tuesday

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:20.260
I'm gonna take one of those days and use it for a meetup and one of those days to play the tourist thing and just

01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:25.460
Like take a day off and actually enjoy the area so that I'm hoping to have two extra days in San Francisco

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:28.980
And I want to use one of them to spend it with the audience and one of it to do the tourist thing

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:33.860
So I don't know which ones yet, but it'll be Monday and Tuesday and I'll I'll say more

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:37.140
I'll probably on my Twitter account at Chris. Oh, yes, but if you're gonna be at meet BSD

01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:40.100
I'd love to see you or if you're in the Berkeley area and want to meet up

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:47.060
Let's do it meet BSD comm by the way, if I think I'm I I'm gonna tell you

01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:52.420
If you're gonna go to one BSD event in 2016, I think this is the one it really seems like it now

01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.580
There's some international ones that are pretty badass, too

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:58.420
But if you're gonna go to one in the US this year, there's probably other great ones coming up

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.900
But if you're gonna go to one, I think that might be BSD returns home

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:05.380
That's what they pretty Berkeley. Yeah. Yeah, the Berkeley systems distribution, right? All right

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:13.460
So let's talk about our next sponsor DigitalOcean go over to digitalocean.com and use our very special promo code of absolute power and knowledge

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:16.740
DO Unplugged it's one word. It's lowercase

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:22.420
You go create an account you go in their dashboard you apply it as your payment method

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:27.940
Now you're not putting a credit card in there. You're not putting your pay pals in there or whatever's they've got your back

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:32.100
You're going in there. You're putting in DO Unplugged. You're getting a $10 credit

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:35.860
Actually, if you already have an account too, and you you know, you you've not used our promo code

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:42.100
You can also get a credit. What a deal. I know digitalocean.com is a great way to get a $10 credit

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:46.340
What a deal. I know digitalocean is super cool to let you right think they've already got you

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:49.220
They didn't have to let you do that. Not at all. That's really cool

01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:52.420
And so that's kind of gives you an insight to what a badass company they are

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.500
They're a really great simple cloud hosting provider

01:08:54.820 --> 01:09:01.000
Dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up your own super fast system on their infrastructure

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:04.260
They're all linux

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:06.260
They use KVM for the virtualization

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:09.380
SSD for the back end storage. So everything's super fast

01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:13.860
You know it and you get to pick from all of the distros that you would run on a server

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:16.740
Plus free bsd if you're a bsd folk

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:22.660
And and and there's some cool things you can do when you start playing with their block storage and zfs

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:24.340
There is some cool things you can do

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:27.060
But really you can get started for five bucks five bucks a month

01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:29.540
If you use our promo code do unplug you get $10 two months for free

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:32.260
Whoa, you can get started in less than a minute

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.900
You'll get a really nice system

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:40.020
And they have an interface that even if you've never set up a server before you'll be able actually it's so easy

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:45.860
If you've never installed linux even you could do it. You really you really could but what what I think is probably more

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:50.980
Noteworthy and remarkable about that is first of all, they've managed to do this in a web application second of all

01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:52.740
They manage to do in a browser

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:57.140
Compatible compatible way that works like on your on your phone. It works on your linux box

01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:01.960
You don't have to have java installed. You don't have flash installed. Yeah, you get a full html5

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:06.060
Console access to your rig. That's all nice. Yep

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.820
but beginners or

01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:14.100
Advanced users that have been setting up systems for decades are going to be happy with this and then on top of that if you

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:18.300
Even know how to poke at ruby or php or python you can use their api

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:22.540
Like you can if you just know how to poke and they have tons of great open source applications

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:24.540
You can just take advantage of already

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:30.140
It's amazing. It's a great service and they're super fast and they got data centers in new york, san francisco

01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:34.780
Singapore Amsterdam, london, toronto, germany and india so you can be like a boss all over the world

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.820
Just use our promo code do unplugged

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:43.500
I mean it is so awesome to see how linux and kvm can bring

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:50.520
The fundamental technologies to a company where they can focus on the things like the api the interface the documentation the community

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:58.120
Finally somebody took advantage of all of it and that's digital ocean digital ocean comm just use our promo code

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:02.240
Do unplugged and a big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.680
the unplugged program

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:10.880
So we were kind of kvotsing about this a little bit ago in the show and we were talking about how most people in the enterprise

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:15.740
Don't give a single crap that the canonical livepatch client is

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:22.680
Commercial software or that the back end is managed by launchpad, which is commercial software, right? They could the

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:26.320
businesses that are more than ten people

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:33.720
Okay, I've never met a single one of them that would care unless their business is linux and open like system 76

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:37.960
They care right I don't but like there's like even less a lot of the enterprises

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.520
That's not what they're concerned if your business isn't open source and Linux you don't you don't give any shits

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:47.320
You really don't and let's be honest with this and and mumble room you feel field just disagree with me

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:54.280
But I thought this post over at naughty computer dot UK, which is a great domain name was pretty good

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:59.800
It says the role of free software in a world that doesn't care the free software movement is about personal and social

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.900
liberties giving the owner and the user of a computer control over it

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:11.560
But most people don't see the problem with a small number of multinational mega corporations having control over everyone's computers

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.840
They think Apple and Microsoft know what they're doing and they do a good job

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.860
So why would I need free software I?

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:27.740
Can see a lot of people's thoughts like that or or even worse?

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:34.420
They've never even thought of heard of or conceptualize a world of free software

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:38.100
They only see a world of apps and commercial software

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:45.860
And I would suspect without I mean I would I would find it very hard to dispute the idea that that is must that must

01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:53.140
Be the very vast majority of consumers mm-hmm. I won't meet him and that's a that's a default right you need your next program

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:56.220
You you buy it off the shelf you get it for however long and support it

01:12:56.220 --> 01:13:00.540
And then you buy the new one my lady friend is a good example before she met me

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:04.140
I think she had heard Linux mentioned as the thing that

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:09.860
Runs her server and she knew a couple of computer people that sometimes talked about Linux

01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:13.260
but she didn't know that it was free or that it was open and

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:20.540
she didn't really ever even consider that there was such a thing because everything else in our life that we interact with is

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:27.140
Product eyes commercialized specialty thing you got to get by that model. It's branded. It's it's

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:28.460
Marketed yep

01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:35.380
So you don't even your mo your mind doesn't even shift to that mode to understand that there could be something like free software

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.580
This country is created not by a company

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:45.140
But by a system of volunteers who are each scratching their own itch that idea isn't something that you just consider

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:49.340
You have to be introduced to it and like my lady friend when I introduced her to it

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:51.820
She well this is obviously the better way to go

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:54.020
This is unquestionably even as a I mean

01:13:54.020 --> 01:14:00.220
I'm a small business person with like a couple of people working here, and this seems like an obviously good choice for my business

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:04.240
But until you understand and see it you don't you don't even conceptualize it

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:10.800
So, what is the role of free software in a world where that is perhaps arguably the reality?

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.800
Mom or do you have any thoughts?

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.720
Yeah, I think

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:23.240
The problem is that they don't understand the whole computer thing

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:26.520
It's not the thing that they don't care. They don't understand

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:31.400
So it's some kind of such protection to pretend that Microsoft and Apple care for them

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:35.320
Hmm, because you trust in a brand you trust in the name

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.200
Yeah, because really if they screwed it up so bad. They'd be out of business

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:44.920
Yeah, but if you don't know

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:50.920
You know how to drive a car, but you don't know what the car is doing

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:55.640
You don't know the whole moat. I don't know how to build the car. No, I couldn't replace my car's computer. No

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.360
so

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:06.080
So it's the same thing for a computer user a normal computer user does not know what the computer is doing

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.480
He can only

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.200
consume

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:16.360
Software and use software but doesn't know how it works. So it's yeah Mosenrath your thoughts

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:23.120
Okay, so if you can see in the the the chat room there we've been discussing it as well

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:26.760
but a lot of it is off of it's not a matter of really an

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:31.120
active not knowing or an active not caring what they see is as

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:37.480
The previous person said they just see a product they use it and as I was saying to others does it work?

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:41.160
Yes, then they use that product. They don't know if it's free

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.480
they don't know if it's

01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:48.840
Not free in terms of free as in speech not free as in beer as that is one of the main things that comes up

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:55.400
Quite often but in terms of the see cult was just it's like the cell free software commercial software could be for your

01:15:55.400 --> 01:16:02.200
Proprietary, right? It's a matter of does it work? It does. Okay. I'm good. I'm out

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:05.960
They're not worried about any of the other stuff because they know full well

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:11.320
Microsoft doesn't care about them Apple doesn't care about them. You know what those companies care about

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:17.560
Well companies always care about your pocketbook your wallet the moment that you open it up

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:24.920
They are happy to talk to you you close it up the conversation ends you go to something like say Cody or VLC

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:31.560
They say we don't need your pocketbook. The person says hey, I don't need to open up my wallet. Awesome

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:36.880
I'll use this. Yeah, it works. Excellent. I'm out. Yeah, so

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.760
This is where I find the absolute

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:46.200
brilliant silver lining in this concept

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.280
because so often as users who perhaps are

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:55.240
just solely consumers of open-source software

01:16:55.240 --> 01:17:00.000
Maybe you you download the latest distribution you install all the great open-source software

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:04.360
Maybe you caveats online in the comment section about something not working

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:10.600
But you don't very often or if ever submit a bug perhaps you don't submit a patch upstream

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:14.460
You don't necessarily get involved in the mailing list

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:17.420
You primarily consume

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.600
But you do something else too

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:21.960
you

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:23.760
likely advocate

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:30.320
You spread the word about Linux you show maybe a friend who gets intellectually curious and it turns out

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.760
that's

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:38.680
fundamental to the survival of free software and so as regular Linux users we have an

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:46.500
Absolute vital role in the entire ecosystem of free software and its continuation and survival and I don't I don't think it's

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:51.860
Overselling it to say that this is one of the most important roles in free software is advocacy and education

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:54.860
Now how you do it the people you do it to

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:58.140
That could all be argued. That's the nuance

01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:03.820
But there is such an important place for advocacy still even in 2016

01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:07.740
Even when Linux has taken over the cloud and networking and mobile

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:11.820
This is still a fundamental issue and

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:18.260
There are people who are not even in tech who are not even necessarily tech heads or technologists

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:26.500
Who can see the benefits it just has to be a certain person who's intellectually curious about these things or has a motivation to learn

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:27.860
more and

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:31.460
If you you know look at Noah look how many people he switches to Linux and daily

01:18:31.620 --> 01:18:36.900
Conversations just by like kind of just by sussing out their needs and yeah, well, here's how Linux could fix that for you

01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:42.220
And here's how it's all that for you instant right like you don't have to wait to talk to a sales rep you don't

01:18:42.220 --> 01:18:47.580
Have to it's just it's there. It's your right to have it. It's yeah, you've always had it

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:52.220
You just didn't know I and it may also I suppose this is very self-serving

01:18:52.220 --> 01:19:00.260
I guess but it makes me very proud to to run a network that has many programs that talk about Linux and

01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:06.660
open-source and BSD and and help people learn and discover more about it and make it useful in their daily lives because I

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:09.500
really truly believe that advocacy is a

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:15.280
Crucial part to the free software ecosystem, and if you've ever felt bad about maybe being a leech like that

01:19:15.620 --> 01:19:20.660
If you've played that role, or you can play that role you are taking part now

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:25.740
You can do more at any time, and I encourage you to do so but there that is there's something to that Wes

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:27.740
I think that's pretty cool

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:29.820
and

01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:35.700
That right there brings us to the end of this week's episode of the unplugged program if you'd like to join us live

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:38.100
Join us over JB live TV. Oh when?

01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:40.900
What a great come on

01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:42.980
Tuesdays well yeah of course about

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:49.220
Tuesdays what time you know that's 2 p.m.. Yes team. Yeah, you could also get it converted automatically

01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:53.340
It's you have a magic robot. It just does it for us calendar page Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.620
You can send us in your thoughts you put a broadcasting comm slash contact submit

01:19:56.620 --> 01:20:02.100
Stories and community updates at Linux action show dot reddit comm and if you're on the youtubes

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:31.660
And you made it this far give it a thumbs up come on come on all right. We'll see you back here next Tuesday

01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:35.100
So

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:45.100
I

01:20:55.180 --> 01:21:00.580
So we're gonna start giving these away or selling them. I'm not sure look amazing. Yeah, I think it's a super great idea I

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:05.980
Think you could probably sell a whole sheet of them. I don't think see and I think she's just thinking about giving a few

01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:07.980
Away at a time, but I think you could probably just so yeah

01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:13.380
Yeah, I would because then why then I just happen for my future keyboards. I don't want that window shame all right

01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:17.060
So I'm trying to cover up my super key like I got mine on I got it

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:20.660
It's a little tiny bit lopsided, but that's oh look at my pop

01:21:20.660 --> 01:21:27.500
That's all mine mine's my my super key actually had a circular indent to begin with so I'm pretty happy

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:31.900
It's not great, but you see that looks like it fits in right in there doesn't wow yeah, that's nice

01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:34.700
so

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.820
Yeah, that's our that's our super key, but yeah, yeah, yeah, so how's it look on yours?

01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:43.940
Actually, not too bad. I'd say it looks as good. I'd say it actually looks better than the Ubuntu sticker

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:50.460
That's on the Librem 15. Yeah, so hmm. I wonder how it look if your keyboard lit up. Oh your keyboard does light up

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:55.340
Not too bad. It looks fine good. I was wondering if it would shine through, but yeah, it looks good I

01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:56.740
I

01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:59.420
Like it. Yeah, it does have a little bit of a shine. I'd say ah

01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:06.020
Very good very good, so you approve it. Oh, man. This is great everyone should get them

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:08.100
It's funny because you know when you think stickers you think big stuff

01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:12.240
But that little tiny super key sticker is legit, and I hate seeing that little Windows key

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:15.540
And I like you know most of the people should I have yeah, I don't have them

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.580
I know I know you can't do anything about the most of the way

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:22.160
I wish you know Microsoft they really they really had I wonder how they pulled that off

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:28.220
I would like to know this the history of the Windows key and how they worked like what I envision is I

01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:31.860
Envision like they nailed a couple of manufacturers

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:36.500
And then the industry just decided to take off with it was easier to just have it all under yeah

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:37.580
Oh

01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:42.620
Look at that dos keyboard sells a Linux keycap bundle. That's awesome excellent

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:47.140
It seems to be a lot of people are getting into replacing getting keyboards where they can individually replace the keycaps

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:48.800
Which is none of my keyboards?

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:52.860
I can do that with but I don't like any of my keyboards a whole lot except for my Logitech upstairs, okay?

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:56.280
Yeah, but like that seems a lot like a lot of fiddling

01:22:57.140 --> 01:23:00.660
But at the end you end up with something you've crafted you have great pride in it

01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:07.420
You'd have a lot of you have to have some free time though. That's not something you have a concept up. Oh, I see yep

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:11.380
Theoretically I can do that when my gateway laptop

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:14.340
Really it has keycaps on a huh?

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.020
Yeah, I learned that the hard way

01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:21.340
About six years back and then when I went into a bit of rage

01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:27.960
And then accidentally pop the you keep loose from the keyboard and that's why I had to quickly put it back on there before

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.840
Anybody noticed all right?

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:32.740
Well, we got ten Fridays left or nine Fridays left until Christmas

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.200
So you guys have enough time to get me a mechanical keyboard for Christmas?

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.600
I'm a kid. I don't I would not well actually I would probably use one

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:42.120
But not in studio, so you'd never get to see me using it because it'd be too loud. I would assume

01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:47.000
Yeah, get one of the quieter ones, but then what's the point don't they not feel as good well?

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I mean, there's there's many different

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:50.140
actuation

01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:51.920
Love it. You know you can get lots of different feels

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:57.460
I have a code keyboard at home with the clear keycaps, which I like that. They're not too loud

01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:59.420
I mean, I don't know if they'd be quite enough for the studio

01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:02.340
But I bet you could find something and you can still be you know a lot of them

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:09.620
So I have nicer construction anyway, okay, so oh wait. Yeah, you know a deeper. So are you are you telling me that I?

01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:15.500
Can I my understanding is that if you want the right feeling like you want that old?

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:16.960
old

01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:22.720
mechanical keyboard feeling from back in the early 90s 80s and 70s or whatever the hell you know almost like

01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:27.220
Clunk clunk clunk. I thought in order to get the right feeling you had to have a certain amount of sound

01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:29.360
I thought there was you can't divorce the two

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:35.520
I thought so I thought if I as I begin to compromise on the amount of sound I also compromise on the feel is

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:41.240
That true I mean if I think if you're trying to read exactly recreate like the IBM buckling spring type switches

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:46.840
Then yeah, maybe you do, but I think there's a range of things that people like and that people appreciate and for different purposes

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:51.380
Right like a lot of gamers like the cherry MX red style series where it's like a linear press

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:54.220
So I think there's a wide range you might not find one

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:56.460
That's it you might find the you know like a loud one that you like more

01:24:56.460 --> 01:25:00.460
But I think you can find something that's better than say that little Apple keyboard. You've got over there

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:07.140
Yeah, although I mean, but I think one thing here's one key so one thing I'll touch on there

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:12.640
So I first of all I'm afraid of my own personality when it comes to quieter keyboards

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.100
I'll get there, but to the Apple thing. I'm not a huge fan of them

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:19.620
But I also don't I don't hate them and one thing that if I was an Apple user

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:22.740
I think I would appreciate is I'm not positive, but I think

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.300
I'm not sure if this is true anymore actually maybe it's not true anymore

01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:31.860
But for a long time like they had the same keyboard layout across the laptops and their physical keyboards

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:38.060
So you could interchange. I mean it was it was that that that muscle memory worked across a range of the products

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:42.900
Which is a great idea going back to the mechanical keyboard thing and I don't know if that's true anymore for Apple

01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:45.200
But then what here's why I don't want to get quieter keys

01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:49.420
This is the type of person I am I I have two modes

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:53.460
I don't give a I don't care about the quality of this thing

01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:58.320
Mm-hmm or I care about the quality of it sure and if I care about the quality of it very best

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:03.060
And and if I don't what I'll do is I'll first buy the I'll buy the low-level one then I'll buy the mid-level one

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:07.140
And I'll try I know I will try to stay there as long as I can and I will guilt myself

01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:12.900
I will internally beat myself up for wanting the better one when I have already bought the low one and the mid one and I'll fight

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:17.540
With myself, and it'll be like this ongoing thing that steals brain CPU for days or months

01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:22.980
And depending on the price sometimes a year or you know and then I finally make the go and I love it

01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:25.640
I love it way way more like for example

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:30.980
Perfect example, I bought the the rover right it was a great price

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:34.420
I got it on I forget consignment, so I got a great deal on it

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:38.480
And it was a nice travel trailer was a mid-level travel trailer

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.940
and then once I realized that I actually liked living in a tiny space and

01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:50.500
That I liked the concept of our being and I liked how I liked how it's I use less I I consume less

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:52.500
I liked all the things about it, and then it was

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:56.240
Well now if I'm going to do this. I'm gonna do it right

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.400
I don't I don't want to and I didn't go out and buy like some

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:02.080
$300,000 diesel pusher I mean I have my limits of due to budget

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:07.780
But I I knew I knew almost within the moment. I knew I liked our being I knew then immediately

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:12.360
I was gonna be getting a class a RV at some point because I'm not gonna if I know I can do better and that same

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:17.520
Thing applies to production like I if I'm working on if I'm editing or I'm putting together something

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.740
And I know it could be a little better. I'm not gonna stop there

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:24.720
I'll go till it's as best as I can get it and so I'm worried about what the keyboard thing is that if I start

01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:30.360
Caring about that. I will really care about that and then and then I'm really in a world of hurt because what do I do?

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:35.300
Do I start replacing all my keyboards and then some keyboards don't feel right so so far

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:41.300
What I have what I have allowed myself to do is I have a keyboard that I really like to use

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:43.300
Okay, and I would be sad if it went away

01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:49.620
But I I don't let myself go any further in fear of have you found this to be true for yourself once you start

01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:55.580
Looking into super nice keyboards. Did you slip into a keyboard like a keyboard snob range now?

01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:58.260
Yeah, I think I was ready to become a keyboard snob

01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:02.920
I have not as far as replacing everything I think the next on my list is getting one really nice one for work

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.380
What if you think about it, dude?

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:11.220
Like there are a few things in my life that my hands touch more of right and like that's one of the things you do

01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:15.020
Let you consider yourself good at right like just be good with computers. It's a huge part of my work

01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:19.700
It's a huge part of my hobby. It's it's like it's such a fundamental thing. Oh god now

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:24.260
I'm starting to care and I can also appreciate that like it's hard to like you you have to know like alright

01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:27.100
Well if I'm gonna do this like I'm you can't do it half-assed, right?

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:30.720
You cannot you're gonna have to do it. Well, and that's takes a lot of research and time. Yeah

01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:32.820
Sometimes it's just so don't okay

01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:36.660
So I so somebody who must have been listening to Koda radio because this has been on my mind yet

01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:41.340
It looks like t3 hit t3 late in the chat room is asking about I have a keyboard upstairs

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:47.980
This is my favorite keyboard and it is a logitech that runs Linux and I can't remember if it's like a

01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:51.900
It's a gaming keyboard. I think it might be the g15. Let me go look

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:56.340
And it's an older. No. No, that's not it. That's not the g15

01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:00.620
It's got a flip up LCD screen and it's it's super old

01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:05.420
I actually did I'd actually use it as a runs Linux once on last because I mean, how could I not right?

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:08.060
Yeah, the damn thing actually runs Linux with a little flip up screen

01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:12.780
And it's supposed to have like these widgets that interact with your computer and there is some Linux software

01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:19.460
So here is a version of it this nope, that isn't it either but it looks kind of like this with an LCD screen

01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:22.060
It's a logitech. I

01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:27.080
Can't remember but it is it has a great feel to it. It's not all the way

01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:30.780
Crazy, but I really like to visit here. It is this is it right here

01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.540
I really like the positioning of all of the keys

01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:38.580
I like the one of the things I really like about it is it has this roller knob right here

01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:40.540
That's sunken into the keyboard for volume

01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:43.520
yeah, and then a dedicated mute switch and then

01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:47.420
logical playback controls that are laid out like they normally would be on a

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:52.620
Player device with play pause and skip tracks right there. I think like you'd find on your stereo or whatever

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:58.940
Yeah, so this is the logitech g19 and I don't even think they oh they make newer ones. Hmm interesting and

01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:03.940
I don't know about any more but the version I have which does run a little warm

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:09.380
Has a Linux a Linux computer in there to do all the little witty stuff. Yeah, some

01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:15.940
Ancient old version. Oh god. I'm sure I can only imagine so undefined. Let's see the new version

01:30:15.940 --> 01:30:18.620
Oh, they don't even tell me the price because Amazon doesn't sell it directly

01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:25.300
But it looks like you can get it used from a reseller for a hundred bucks, but new it's 280

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:29.940
280 290 here it is. Yeah, I think I remembered spending quite a bit on this

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:33.900
But you know looking back up looking back at it. Now. I have had it for a

01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:39.420
Really long time. I mean I bought the first version that they years ago

01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:44.260
And so I think the investment paid off you and for for for the idea

01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:51.700
Here's the idea is while you're working on the LCD screen. You're looking at your you're looking at your CPU usage

01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:54.020
You're looking at your memory stats like it's a little mini top

01:30:54.020 --> 01:31:01.300
I do like that that's neat right or temperatures and of course they have a whole bunch of shitty software that makes it work automatically with

01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:03.700
Windows, but there were ways eventually to get it work on Linux

01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:04.540
But you know what?

01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:07.820
I have not I had probably haven't bothered setting that up in two three years

01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:11.520
I can think see that really handy if you could just like redirect one terminals output

01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:14.800
Yeah, one of the other things you could redirect to it was VLC

01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:19.180
So you could redirect VLC playback on the LCD screen Wow

01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:24.820
Yeah, which was so cool for like just watching a little video or something also playback

01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:30.900
You could you could see that like the track information stuff like that for like maybe a if your music application supported that

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.020
It was nice

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.900
Notifications notifications could go down there, too

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:37.020
But again, I I don't even know if it works and works

01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:39.900
I probably haven't bothered setting up for two years is the version today

01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:43.140
I just duct-taped my phone to the top keyboard. I just actually dude

01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:48.260
That's exactly what I use that screen for a lot is because the screen rotates up and down it

01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:52.580
And I so I haven't pivoted up and I lay my lay my script my cell phone on it

01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:54.900
And it's the perfect cell phone holder right there on my keyboard

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:10.020
May I jump in yeah. Yeah, there is indeed a software again gnome 15 is called

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:17.600
Before there was the gnome 15 daemon daemon, but that's not maintained anymore. So now they use gnome 15

01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:20.600
You can have a look at gnome 15 org

01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:27.580
Well, you have to compile it yourself. It's not in the repository any distribution. I used I gave it a try

01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:29.580
I have a lock attack

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:33.020
Speaker okay this

01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:41.140
Does that 11 or said I don't remember set 11, I think and you can use the gnome 15

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:49.620
Software to display the same information your talk before so cool you search and all that stuff. I do like that

01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:56.660
I do too. Yeah, that's quite cool. You know be the coolest geek project ever and I wish I could remember stuff when I say this

01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:00.180
Would be to have a way to wire out

01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:07.220
You ever watch Star Trek Voyager? Absolutely. Okay. Do you remember when they built in a bio-neuter gel pack?

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:15.700
No, do you remember when they built the Delta flyer and they put the the physical toggle switches in there that were like the ones

01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:17.700
from their holodeck program and

01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:24.900
the captain protons type stuff and it was so it was this 24th century technology that had a

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:32.340
What we would see as touch interface, right? Yeah. Yeah, I had more like a 1920s style physical toggles and stuff like that

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:34.220
I would love to take like

01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:38.700
from a like a old old used parts or something where you can get like voltage meters and stuff and

01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:43.660
be able to hook those up to an interface on a Linux box that would correspond the

01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:50.860
Little needle to CPU usage so I could have physical boxes. Yes with like needles moving the rep represent CPU usage

01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:55.940
I think that'd be so cool. Yep. We're like nixie tube spelling out things. Oh god. I'm totally rather

01:33:55.940 --> 01:34:21.460
I actually go nixie tubes because then you can actually change up what it is a little more. Yeah, that'd be really cool
