This is Linux Unplugged Episode 20 for December 24th, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.380
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's making

00:40.380 --> 00:42.520
our list and checking it twice.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.700
My name is Chris.

00:43.700 --> 00:44.700
My name is Matt.

00:44.700 --> 00:45.700
Hey Matt.

00:45.700 --> 00:47.360
Episode 20, buddy, and it's a happy holiday around here.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.680
I've got the Christmas tree up, but I'm going to be honest.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.660
That top star, I tried to put it on the top of the tree.

00:53.660 --> 00:54.840
I was foiled, Matt.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.760
The hole is too small.

00:56.760 --> 00:59.680
And you know, I've had that problem with more things than just the tree, but I've also yet

00:59.680 --> 01:01.440
to put decorations up, so I won't talk.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.120
It's been a reoccurring, boy, you better get on it, Matt.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.120
It is.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.120
I know.

01:06.120 --> 01:07.120
Well, we got the tree up, but we have no decorations.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.400
We've got to look at it like, eh, do I really care?

01:08.400 --> 01:09.400
It's a staged approach.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
No.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.400
You've got to think about this.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.900
So first, it's a lot like software deployment.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.640
You deploy your base package, make sure everything's stable.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.060
You got to run that for a little bit.

01:18.060 --> 01:21.320
Make sure your change control committee has signed off on the deployment.

01:21.320 --> 01:23.840
And then once the tree is up, you deploy the lights.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.120
And then once the committee signed off on that, you deploy the decorations.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.120
Yeah.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.120
Now I understand.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.120
That's good.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.480
See, here, we just do a shotgun at the Fisher residence.

01:31.480 --> 01:33.080
We just throw things on there.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.080
I like that idea.

01:34.080 --> 01:35.080
I like that idea.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.360
Personally, I say lights and tinsel, you're done, right?

01:37.360 --> 01:38.360
Right.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.360
It's all you really need.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.360
Yeah.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.680
I'm one of those people who would actually like to keep the tree up all year round, because

01:42.680 --> 01:45.320
I just like the ambient light it gives off.

01:45.320 --> 01:50.960
But we have also now, because we're parents, we have used the tree as a motivator to make

01:50.960 --> 01:52.680
our children behave when we have a babysitter.

01:52.680 --> 01:56.880
So I went out and did some Christmas shopping, and my wife was going out and doing some scrap

01:56.880 --> 01:57.880
booking.

01:57.880 --> 02:02.120
And we're parents, we're leaving the house, it never happens, probably only time it's

02:02.120 --> 02:04.400
ever happened this year alone.

02:04.400 --> 02:09.200
And so we thought, well, we'll reserve some of the decorations, and that way the babysitter

02:09.200 --> 02:13.960
can leverage the decorations to solicit the cooperation of the children.

02:13.960 --> 02:19.480
And I'm not saying you should leverage the holiday spirit when possible, but personal

02:19.480 --> 02:22.120
experience does show it does seem to work.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.120
Mm-hmm.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.120
All right, Matt.

02:24.120 --> 02:27.240
Well, our first one is something we've been getting a lot of emails about.

02:27.240 --> 02:31.440
And to be honest with you, I haven't seen a big controversy with it, so I haven't covered

02:31.440 --> 02:34.800
it on any of our shows yet, but we've gotten a lot of emails, and Mark just had a really

02:34.800 --> 02:36.840
good concise email about it.

02:36.840 --> 02:42.280
He writes in, he says, I just saw an article about Canonical asking the Linux Mint project

02:42.280 --> 02:46.960
and maybe other Ubuntu-based distros to license the Ubuntu binary files in their software

02:46.960 --> 02:47.960
repo.

02:47.960 --> 02:51.220
Whatever happened to open source and the GPL?

02:51.220 --> 02:52.220
So here's the...

02:52.220 --> 02:57.240
And I'll cut through what everybody in the Linux, I'm going to say 99% of the Linux community

02:57.240 --> 03:01.280
misunderstands about how the GPL license works.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.240
Free is in freedom, not free is in beer.

03:03.240 --> 03:07.840
And so when something is done a certain way and if it's allowable, if you're not actually

03:07.840 --> 03:11.080
working with the code, you're working with those particular packages, and however they

03:11.080 --> 03:15.480
determine to the act of compiling them or whatever it is, whatever they've got going

03:15.480 --> 03:18.640
on, honestly, at the end of the day, I'm not really a fan of the idea.

03:18.640 --> 03:22.200
I think it's a huge mistake, but can they do it?

03:22.200 --> 03:23.200
Can they do it?

03:23.200 --> 03:24.200
Yeah, they can.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.200
Well, sure, they sure they can.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.200
Yeah, absolutely they can.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.200
They can totally do.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.200
That's what people don't...

03:28.200 --> 03:29.200
Do you remember when the Firefox...

03:29.200 --> 03:31.880
Do you remember that when Firefox and Debian had their hold falling out and they renamed

03:31.880 --> 03:32.880
it to Iceweasel?

03:32.880 --> 03:33.880
Oh, yes, over the trademark logos, yeah.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.880
And everybody got all sensitive about it.

03:34.880 --> 03:35.880
Yeah.

03:35.880 --> 03:40.360
So the Distro Watch ran this report based on a comment that Clem made on his blog post.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.560
Now I want to give you guys a sense of actually how old this is.

03:43.560 --> 03:49.360
So Clem made this post, remember back a few weeks ago when a couple of Ubuntu developers

03:49.360 --> 03:53.480
and actually one that's not even...I don't think he's in the Ubuntu project anymore,

03:53.480 --> 03:59.040
Ben, made some comments as sometimes Mint is behind the ball on security updates.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.720
At that time, Clem did a very good, very rational follow-up post that said, here's what's really

04:03.720 --> 04:04.720
going on.

04:04.720 --> 04:07.720
And in that, towards the end of that post, he made reference that, oh, by the way, I've

04:07.720 --> 04:11.240
been speaking with Canonical Legal about licensing their binary files.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.960
In fact, this is the Slashdart post on it.

04:12.960 --> 04:13.960
It's pretty brief.

04:13.960 --> 04:17.480
It says, Clem claims he has been asked by Canonical's legal department to license the

04:17.480 --> 04:20.480
binary packages used by Ubuntu.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.600
He says, to me, this is a scary thought.

04:24.600 --> 04:29.840
Ubuntu-based distributions for many projects out there, some of them such as Mint and Kubuntu,

04:29.840 --> 04:31.080
are quite successful.

04:31.080 --> 04:35.360
Clem's statement makes it clear that Canonical's approach other open source projects about

04:35.360 --> 04:39.220
licensing the right across Ubuntu's repos.

04:39.220 --> 04:43.640
They go on to ask, would derivative distributions need to pay to use Canonical's packages?

04:43.640 --> 04:48.640
How would Canonical enforce such a policy with lawyers by blocking access to repositories

04:48.640 --> 04:51.720
if they isn't using genuine Ubuntu?

04:51.720 --> 04:57.440
Now I thought it would be negligent here on our part to pick our resident Ubuntu expert.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.440
Now he, Popey, will be speaking on behalf of himself, not the Canonical company.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.980
But I wonder, Popey, do you kind of agree with me?

05:03.980 --> 05:05.160
Is this kind of a non-story?

05:05.160 --> 05:08.040
I mean, we've seen this before with upstream vendors, right?

05:08.040 --> 05:10.120
And Firefox comes to mind.

05:10.120 --> 05:16.360
Firefox has contacted distributions in the past and said, hey, could you not use our

05:16.360 --> 05:18.920
branding and our slogan?

05:18.920 --> 05:22.440
If you're going to follow these rules, you either need a license from us or you need

05:22.440 --> 05:23.440
to come up with something else.

05:23.440 --> 05:28.280
Is, Popey, in your opinion, is this what we're seeing here?

05:28.280 --> 05:29.280
It's tricky, yeah.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.280
I'm not speaking for Canonical.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.000
This is my personal opinion.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.520
And I can see why there's some uproar.

05:34.520 --> 05:39.880
I can see why there's backlash because we give everything away for free, right?

05:39.880 --> 05:44.600
You get the Ubuntu software for nothing and then, hang on, this guy is trying to make

05:44.600 --> 05:51.080
a derivative of Ubuntu and it's seen by many as competition for us.

05:51.080 --> 05:55.360
And maybe some people see us as, you know, butthurt that some guy is getting a lot of

05:55.360 --> 05:59.760
attention and maybe we're trying to get some money out of him, you know, to compensate

05:59.760 --> 06:00.760
us for that.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.880
But my perspective, I don't think that's the case.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.920
I think what you've got to remember is that there's the Ubuntu project itself, there's

06:07.920 --> 06:13.280
the derivatives, which, you know, your listener mentioned Kubuntu, but he mentioned Kubuntu

06:13.280 --> 06:16.160
and Mint in the same breath and they're not really the same.

06:16.160 --> 06:24.560
Kubuntu, Edubuntu, Mythbuntu and all the other flavors have been brought into the Ubuntu

06:24.560 --> 06:29.680
project and they have some level of responsibility for the packages that they deliver.

06:29.680 --> 06:35.440
So the Kubuntu project actually work on their KDE packages and we have a level of responsibility

06:35.440 --> 06:38.800
to ensure that the rest of the archive works with what they make.

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
It's kind of under the same umbrella.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.800
And the same goes for all the others.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.800
Okay.

06:41.800 --> 06:42.800
Yeah.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.800
And so we work together.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.520
We work collaboratively on the same set of packages.

06:45.520 --> 06:51.120
So we don't, you know, ask the Kubuntu developers to have some kind of, you know, payment licensing

06:51.120 --> 06:54.560
thing because they're working on the same set of packages that we are.

06:54.560 --> 07:00.880
Whereas derivatives, some derivatives will take our source packages and rebuild them.

07:00.880 --> 07:05.280
I can't for the life of me think of anyone who does that, but that's possible in the

07:05.280 --> 07:11.200
way that SteamOS have rebuilt the Debian packages, so Valve have rebuilt the Debian packages

07:11.200 --> 07:12.200
for SteamOS.

07:12.200 --> 07:15.920
They built their own binaries based on the Debian source packages.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.520
So that's seen as okay.

07:19.520 --> 07:21.120
Whereas Linux Mint are not doing that.

07:21.120 --> 07:27.340
What Linux Mint are doing is delivering an ISO image, which points to our archive and

07:27.340 --> 07:32.800
our mirrors, which are maintained by people that we pay and our community work on our

07:32.800 --> 07:36.600
project and they're getting the benefit from that.

07:36.600 --> 07:41.720
So I can see how, I can see both sides of it, but I can, I can certainly see why Canonica

07:41.720 --> 07:42.720
will be not.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.720
So have you heard of any, is there a financial terms here?

07:43.720 --> 07:44.720
Have you heard of anything like that?

07:44.720 --> 07:45.720
Is there a, is there a...

07:45.720 --> 07:46.720
I have no idea.

07:46.720 --> 07:47.720
Okay.

07:47.720 --> 07:51.440
Because I can, in a way, I suppose you can make the same argument with somebody like

07:51.440 --> 07:52.680
Integros, right?

07:52.680 --> 07:58.720
Where they're building a product, but they're using the hosting of Ubuntu.

07:58.720 --> 08:04.800
So Mint is building their desktop, but if you turned off one night, if boom, all of

08:04.800 --> 08:08.400
the Ubuntu repos were turned off, Mint would become unfunctional.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.400
It would be dysfunctional.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.400
Right.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.520
And I don't, I don't actually think Mint accounts for a huge proportion of the traffic to our

08:13.520 --> 08:14.680
mirrors.

08:14.680 --> 08:21.480
I know people might think that Mint actually, given its ranking on DistroWatch, think that

08:21.480 --> 08:24.960
it's got twice the number of users Ubuntu has, that's flat out isn't the case.

08:24.960 --> 08:25.960
No, I know.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.960
Anyone following DistroWatch needs to know.

08:28.960 --> 08:29.960
Yeah.

08:29.960 --> 08:34.840
So, so I'm not sure it makes a significant dent in the archive, in the, in the, in the

08:34.840 --> 08:39.640
mirrors, the traffic, but it's, it's just, to me, it's irresponsible for them to put

08:39.640 --> 08:48.360
out an ISO image, which depends on what is, in effect, their competitor's product.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.160
You know, you wouldn't, you wouldn't have...

08:50.160 --> 08:52.400
But can't you make that same exact argument?

08:52.400 --> 08:56.880
I mean, you can't make the repo argument, but you can make the derivative argument between

08:56.880 --> 08:59.760
Ubuntu and Debian itself.

08:59.760 --> 09:00.760
We rebuild every package.

09:00.760 --> 09:01.760
Right.

09:01.760 --> 09:02.760
No, I understand.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.760
You host it.

09:03.760 --> 09:09.400
We have, we have developers who are paid to do the patching and, and maintain those packages

09:09.400 --> 09:10.400
in Ubuntu.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.400
Yeah, sure.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.960
There are some that are just straight out rebuilds.

09:12.960 --> 09:13.960
Yeah.

09:13.960 --> 09:19.320
We've imported them from Debian and we rebuild them on our vast array of servers and we host

09:19.320 --> 09:23.560
them on our servers and then our mirrors, you know, mirror them.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.880
So I don't think it's, it's very, it's, it's the same.

09:25.880 --> 09:26.880
No, you're right.

09:26.880 --> 09:30.920
Cause it's more akin to more like Red Hat and CentOS is a relationship in a sense.

09:30.920 --> 09:31.920
Yeah.

09:31.920 --> 09:32.920
And SteamOS and Debian.

09:32.920 --> 09:33.920
Yeah.

09:33.920 --> 09:34.920
Where they're, where, exactly.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.760
SteamOS is also taking on the burden of the infrastructure and re and the rebuilding of

09:37.760 --> 09:42.040
many of the packages, just like CentOS rebuilds all the packages, takes on the burden of hosting

09:42.040 --> 09:44.000
those packages and those repos.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.160
So imagine, imagine for example, if Linux Mint said, you know, whatever desktop they're

09:50.160 --> 09:54.800
using Marte, Cinnamon, whatever it is, and they said, okay, here are all the packages

09:54.800 --> 10:00.720
that for where we are different from Ubuntu, let's try and get those in the archive, in

10:00.720 --> 10:01.720
the Ubuntu archive.

10:01.720 --> 10:02.720
Yeah.

10:02.720 --> 10:06.640
And then once they're in the Ubuntu archive, Linux Mint is for want of a better word, a

10:06.640 --> 10:07.640
flavor of Ubuntu.

10:07.640 --> 10:08.960
It can still be called Linux Mint.

10:08.960 --> 10:13.160
I'm sure, you know, you can, you can still have your default desktop that isn't Unity

10:13.160 --> 10:15.960
if you don't like that isn't known three, if you don't like that, you can still have

10:15.960 --> 10:20.680
whatever, you know, bits and bobs you want, but they're in the archive, they're well maintained.

10:20.680 --> 10:25.680
You know, they get security updates, timely fashion that I know Ollie and Ben alluded

10:25.680 --> 10:32.200
to in that in that blog post, but there isn't this our competitor building on the stuff

10:32.200 --> 10:35.000
that we've we've already built for them, if that makes sense.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.200
And the other thing I personally think is a bit is a bit rude, is taking the Ubuntu

10:40.200 --> 10:43.480
archive, and not only reusing it, but then going

10:43.480 --> 10:44.480
Go ahead.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.480
What happened?

10:45.480 --> 10:46.480
Did we lose him?

10:46.480 --> 10:47.480
I guess.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.400
I think he's about to make his best point yet.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.960
We'll come back to that point.

10:52.960 --> 10:56.120
I think that, you know, from my perspective, and I think he brought up some really good

10:56.120 --> 10:57.120
points.

10:57.120 --> 11:03.080
I have concerns over the, you know, the political capital that actually is played into it and

11:03.080 --> 11:06.440
that, you know, regardless of what company it may be, any public facing company that's

11:06.440 --> 11:11.640
put into that really tough position has to make a, you know, it's about to make that

11:11.640 --> 11:12.640
play.

11:12.640 --> 11:13.760
Are they in a position to actually back that up?

11:13.760 --> 11:18.440
Are they in a position to potentially deal with, even if it's unfair fallout, to deal

11:18.440 --> 11:20.280
with what's going to be fallout over that?

11:20.280 --> 11:24.160
We've seen this with other stuff, other challenges that they've faced.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.560
So I have some concerns there.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.040
And it is interesting to look in there in the

11:27.040 --> 11:28.040
Oh, there we go.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.040
We got him back.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.040
I think you're back.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.040
I think you're back.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.040
Hi there.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.040
We were here the whole time.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.040
I know.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.040
I don't know what happened.

11:35.040 --> 11:40.080
Well, I don't know if you guys have seen Thor, but the five realms are aligning and sometimes

11:40.080 --> 11:42.160
there are phases between the realities.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.160
I think I'm Thor.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.160
Isn't it?

11:44.160 --> 11:47.080
So did I drop out partway through what I was saying?

11:47.080 --> 11:52.800
You were just about to, you were wrapping up your thought on the sort of the use of

11:52.800 --> 11:53.800
the repos, I think.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.800
Yes.

11:54.800 --> 11:55.800
Yeah.

11:55.800 --> 11:58.080
The last thing that I think is just a little bit rude is if you're going to use someone

11:58.080 --> 12:02.760
else's archive, don't go through replacing all the affiliate links, which I know Mint

12:02.760 --> 12:03.760
do.

12:03.760 --> 12:04.760
Oh, interesting.

12:04.760 --> 12:05.760
Yeah.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.760
Yeah.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.760
No, that definitely wins the douche award.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.760
Absolutely.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.560
You know, I don't mean to harsh on Mint, but there is, there is some sort of, um, there

12:11.560 --> 12:14.760
is a like, boy, it's almost like the mob a little bit.

12:14.760 --> 12:18.100
Like you got the Ubuntu boss and then you got the guy working under the Ubuntu boss

12:18.100 --> 12:20.580
who maybe should be kicking up a little bit to the boss, right?

12:20.580 --> 12:23.440
Because he's the boss, letting him work in his district.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.360
I've lost track of who's the boss now.

12:25.360 --> 12:26.360
Well, yeah.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.280
That was a very popular show at one time.

12:28.280 --> 12:31.720
I don't necessarily think I'm ready to take sides on this argument, but I think, I think

12:31.720 --> 12:36.180
the canonical argument is one to be considered because, uh, yeah, there you're, you're basing

12:36.180 --> 12:38.120
a lot of Mint success on Ubuntu.

12:38.120 --> 12:44.160
In fact, I, I was having a discussion in our chat room early this morning, um, that, uh,

12:44.160 --> 12:47.720
somebody was in the chat room who was having some troubles with Linux Mint Debian edition.

12:47.720 --> 12:51.920
And I, I love the Linux Mint Debian edition exists.

12:51.920 --> 12:58.080
And I think that's, I think that's a really good thing, but, uh, what I don't see the,

12:58.080 --> 13:01.800
I don't see the purpose of it compared to straight up Linux Mint because straight up

13:01.800 --> 13:04.240
Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu.

13:04.240 --> 13:08.640
And the primary advantage I see there is Ubuntu compatibility, i.e. if you want to install

13:08.640 --> 13:11.080
something for Ubuntu, it installs perfectly on Linux Mint.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.760
Well, that's not entirely true either.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.720
I mean, they claim binary compatibility with Ubuntu, but that's not entirely true.

13:16.720 --> 13:17.720
No.

13:17.720 --> 13:18.720
It's no.

13:18.720 --> 13:24.800
And, and we get, we get, um, yeah, I know we get people asking us for support on Mint

13:24.800 --> 13:28.160
and sometimes there's things that don't work on Mint that work on Ubuntu.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.160
Really?

13:29.160 --> 13:30.160
Yeah.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.160
I've experienced it.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.000
It's not terribly common, but when you hit it, you hit it like a brick wall.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Well, I suppose so.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Yeah.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.640
Also, y'all forget, um, the whole, uh, browser search engine thing.

13:38.640 --> 13:45.800
They get, uh, Yahoo pays them to not use Google in the, uh, the web browser for Firefox.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.800
They replace the searches.

13:46.800 --> 13:53.120
So what would be really nice is if we worked together and had a set of, a set of packages,

13:53.120 --> 13:59.640
which, you know, were robust, well-tested, secure for our users and Mint users.

13:59.640 --> 14:05.400
I think, Poppy, what you're saying there is a great idea if things were started today,

14:05.400 --> 14:09.820
but you have to, you know, when I look back, I look at, I, I look at Clem as a crazy son

14:09.820 --> 14:12.440
of a bitch who has taken on way more than he can.

14:12.440 --> 14:17.080
And I, and by my estimation, should have burned out like two or three years ago, right?

14:17.080 --> 14:19.440
But the man just keeps moving on.

14:19.440 --> 14:24.640
And really, I believe at the end of the day, it is because he focuses on creating a desktop

14:24.640 --> 14:28.920
that he believes should truly represent what the Linux desktop is capable of.

14:28.920 --> 14:32.520
And what he's primarily focuses on is creating that thing.

14:32.520 --> 14:36.560
And like for me, for example, there are many things in my life and my professional career

14:36.560 --> 14:40.640
and my personal career that fall to the side because I am so focused on making that next

14:40.640 --> 14:41.640
show.

14:41.640 --> 14:42.640
And that's all I think about.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.100
And I think he's the same way about Linux Mint.

14:44.100 --> 14:49.680
He is so zeroed in on that, the idea of collaborating and working with a company where you got to

14:49.680 --> 14:54.600
go through three or four levels of management, maybe through the PR person, it is definitely

14:54.600 --> 14:57.080
an absolute appropriate proposition.

14:57.080 --> 15:00.000
But if you told me that, I'd basically tell you to go fuck yourself.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.360
I got better stuff to do, right?

15:01.360 --> 15:03.720
I have, I got to focus on my work.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.500
I don't have time to play politics or politics.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.640
And I think that's where he's coming from appropriate or not.

15:08.640 --> 15:14.920
And I would maybe suggest that Mint has reached the size where that is no longer appropriate.

15:14.920 --> 15:19.520
Yeah, I think he does feel, you know, from the way I've read his blog post, that a lot

15:19.520 --> 15:23.400
of this kind of politicking is a massive waste of his time, right?

15:23.400 --> 15:24.400
Resources.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.400
Right.

15:25.400 --> 15:26.400
And he has a lot better things to do.

15:26.400 --> 15:30.360
And I can see that, you know, given as a small developer team, you know, don't get me wrong,

15:30.360 --> 15:32.120
I have no problem with Mint existing.

15:32.120 --> 15:37.080
I have no problem with them using personally using the Ubuntu archive.

15:37.080 --> 15:41.120
I just want it all to be above board and for people to stop slinging mud at each other.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.400
And it also seems like I can see the perspective, too.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.280
It's like, well, look, if you, you know, if your success is going to be kind of based

15:46.280 --> 15:50.160
on our labors, if you're going to stand on our shoulders, maybe we can work together

15:50.160 --> 15:54.020
as much as possible to make it an equitable position for everybody.

15:54.020 --> 15:57.000
And I think that's actually completely reasonable, too.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.520
So anyway, so that's our thoughts.

15:58.520 --> 16:01.800
If you guys have been wondering where our stance is on this whole thing, I know we've

16:01.800 --> 16:03.800
had a few threads in the Linux Action Show subreddit.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.600
We've also had plenty of emails about it.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.440
So Mark, thanks for emailing in and kicking that topic off.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.400
I think that was a good discussion to be had.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.200
And I'd love to hear your guys' thoughts on it, too.

16:12.200 --> 16:16.040
So go over to jupyterbroadcasting.com and pop that contact link, choose Linux Unplugged

16:16.040 --> 16:19.840
from the drop down and send us in your thoughts and we'll read them up as follow up in next

16:19.840 --> 16:20.840
week's episode.

16:20.840 --> 16:25.960
But before we go on, I want to thank our first sponsor this week and that, my friends, is

16:25.960 --> 16:26.960
DigitalOcean.

16:26.960 --> 16:32.760
DigitalOcean has opened my eyes that cloud hosting can be one part awesome, two parts

16:32.760 --> 16:35.920
simple, straightforward and also under your control.

16:35.920 --> 16:39.600
And that last little bit there, that where I had a comma and I said, oh, by the way,

16:39.600 --> 16:43.680
it's also under your control, let's put an underline and italicize that because I think

16:43.680 --> 16:44.680
that's the biggest point.

16:44.680 --> 16:46.800
You get root access to the devices you create.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.720
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

16:50.720 --> 16:52.400
to spin up a cloud server.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.520
Users can create a server in 55 seconds.

16:54.520 --> 16:57.160
You know, I did it in 45 seconds.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.160
You can do it.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.160
Time it.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.160
Time it and let me know.

17:00.160 --> 17:01.480
55 seconds though, that's the average.

17:01.480 --> 17:05.480
And their pricing plans start at $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM.

17:05.480 --> 17:09.720
And I want to remind you, Linux has amazing memory management, 512 megs of RAM on a server

17:09.720 --> 17:11.880
that doesn't run a GUI can get you so far.

17:11.880 --> 17:16.680
A 20 gigabyte SSD, again, everything I just said applies to SSD and yes, it's a 20 gigabyte

17:16.680 --> 17:20.240
SSD when you pair that with the DigitalOcean internet speeds.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.240
Woo!

17:21.240 --> 17:22.240
Love that.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.680
When I'm updating Arch, yes, I have an Arch server, everybody get off my sack, I have

17:25.680 --> 17:26.680
an Arch server.

17:26.680 --> 17:31.060
When I'm updating Arch, watching those packages fly down and update, it's as fast as that

17:31.060 --> 17:32.840
SSH session can send me the updates.

17:32.840 --> 17:33.840
It is a beautiful thing.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.280
Plus, you also get a terabyte of transfer.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.280
I like that.

17:37.280 --> 17:40.680
I mean, it's just so stupid, stupidly reasonably as far as price is predictable.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.320
It's so simple to follow too.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.320
Not only is it $5.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.320
Can you click a button?

17:44.320 --> 17:45.320
I mean.

17:45.320 --> 17:46.320
Yeah, right.

17:46.320 --> 17:47.320
Yeah, the droplet deployment is super easy.

17:47.320 --> 17:48.320
It's $5 to start with the base server.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.320
That's what I've got.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.360
If you use the promo code Linux Unplugged December, you'll get a $10 credit, which will

17:52.360 --> 17:53.560
get you two months.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.360
And check this out.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.320
The next box up, $10 a month.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.020
The box up after that, $20 a month.

17:59.020 --> 18:00.480
The next one, $40.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.480
You get it, right?

18:01.480 --> 18:02.480
It's very simple.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.480
Very straightforward.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.400
DigitalOcean also offers hourly pricing.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.160
Now, why would you want hourly pricing?

18:07.160 --> 18:08.400
Well, think about this.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.000
Maybe you've got a project that you want to have a few folks bang on.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.700
Maybe you've got a client you want to spin something up that they can test on because

18:13.700 --> 18:17.400
one of the things DigitalOcean offers you is the ability to clone your droplet.

18:17.400 --> 18:21.440
So if you have a really nice setup with maybe Ubuntu 12.04 and LAMP stack, or maybe you

18:21.440 --> 18:24.560
got Arch in the LAMP stack and you have a project on there you want to deliver to a

18:24.560 --> 18:26.820
client, you can spin up an hourly server.

18:26.820 --> 18:30.080
The client bangs on it for a few hours, gives you their feedback, and then you turn it back

18:30.080 --> 18:31.080
down.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.640
That's where the hourly pricing comes in.

18:32.640 --> 18:35.920
But if you're like me and you want to have some infrastructure support, I have a distribution

18:35.920 --> 18:40.080
system over BitTorrent Sync for the unfiltered supporters, and I use DigitalOcean to supplement

18:40.080 --> 18:41.280
that to make it better.

18:41.280 --> 18:46.600
So that way my customers, aka our supporters, have an amazing experience that saturates

18:46.600 --> 18:49.360
their download capacity, and DigitalOcean provides that.

18:49.360 --> 18:53.080
So go over to DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code LINUXUNPLUGDECEMBER.

18:53.080 --> 18:56.640
You'll get a $10 credit, which if you use the $5 box like I'm using, that's going to

18:56.640 --> 18:57.640
be two months.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.960
By the way, DigitalOcean also offers a vast collection of tutorials in their community

19:00.960 --> 19:02.600
section on their site.

19:02.600 --> 19:06.480
Furthermore, users can submit an article to the community and get paid $50 per published

19:06.480 --> 19:07.480
piece.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.720
We'll have a link to that in the show notes right underneath the banner.

19:09.720 --> 19:15.320
So go over to DigitalOcean and use the promo code LINUXUNPLUGDECEMBER.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.280
It is almost the end of December, so you better use it while you can.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.280
That's all I'm saying.

19:19.280 --> 19:23.440
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.440
Love those guys.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.440
Woohoo!

19:25.440 --> 19:26.440
Good stuff.

19:26.440 --> 19:29.760
Another thing that Matt wrote in, I don't even think I'm screwing that up, I actually

19:29.760 --> 19:31.680
think that's straight up how you say it.

19:31.680 --> 19:36.160
And he has a follow up on our Tiling Window Manager challenge that we're going to be taking

19:36.160 --> 19:37.160
in early 2014.

19:37.160 --> 19:42.120
He says, a fan of the show, and I heard about the potential tiling challenge and figured

19:42.120 --> 19:43.880
I'd shoot you guys a message.

19:43.880 --> 19:50.280
Which is good, Matt, because I feel like you and I, we have vacationed in Tiling Window

19:50.280 --> 19:52.120
Managers, but we have never stayed there.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.120
Right?

19:53.120 --> 19:54.120
Is that true for you?

19:54.120 --> 19:55.120
This is true.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.600
This is the high pressure sales pitch.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.600
Right.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.600
And that would be coming from the chat room.

19:58.600 --> 20:03.560
I spent like a week, I think, once in Awesome for the Linux Action Show, it was like forever

20:03.560 --> 20:04.560
ago.

20:04.560 --> 20:06.600
He says, I posted in the subreddit, but I thought maybe I'd send this in just to make

20:06.600 --> 20:08.080
sure you guys saw it.

20:08.080 --> 20:11.600
He wants to, this Matt, also by the way, I think this might be the way to go.

20:11.600 --> 20:15.580
He says, if you're interested in different Window Managers, I would suggest you check

20:15.580 --> 20:17.280
out Linux BBQ.

20:17.280 --> 20:18.920
It has a distro called Gangbang.

20:18.920 --> 20:19.920
Alright?

20:19.920 --> 20:20.920
Okay, so.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.920
Okay, you got my attention.

20:21.920 --> 20:22.920
I'm interested.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.760
In the Window Manager.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.760
I mean, I'm just saying, Matt.

20:26.760 --> 20:27.760
I'm just.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.760
Choo choo.

20:28.760 --> 20:33.720
So, maybe this would be the way you'd like dip your toe and figure out what you're comfortable

20:33.720 --> 20:34.720
with.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.720
You know, you could swing from desktop to desktop just to see what you like.

20:37.720 --> 20:41.880
He says it has dozens of Window Managers to check out in a live distro.

20:41.880 --> 20:45.480
He says a crazy group that has developed through CrunchBrain, if I'm not mistaken.

20:45.480 --> 20:49.480
In fact, there's a link in CrunchBag's forums where someone tested out 30 Window Managers

20:49.480 --> 20:50.480
in 30 days.

20:50.480 --> 20:54.300
I got to be honest, I've been wanting to try that 30 things out in 30, anyways, a lot

20:54.300 --> 20:56.960
of that info is experiment in Linux BBQ's wiki.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.440
We've mentioned Linux BBQ in the past.

20:58.440 --> 21:03.160
He said, I also want to say I completely agree that what was posted before, I think mentioned

21:03.160 --> 21:06.880
last week's show, which would be better to make your own complete desktop environment.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.600
You're kind of rolling your own distro in a sense.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.640
He says, this is how I do it.

21:10.640 --> 21:14.620
For example, I have Debian testing net install, which brings me to a console.

21:14.620 --> 21:17.920
Then I upgrade to SID, I install SystemD, and I just start configuring.

21:17.920 --> 21:22.280
I use I3 Window Manager or FB term with Tmux, depending on my mood.

21:22.280 --> 21:26.280
I set my background VFF and or Nitrogen.

21:26.280 --> 21:31.240
Lately, I've used XFE or Midnight Commander as a file manager.

21:31.240 --> 21:35.280
I bring in the tools that I think are best, borrowing from other Window Managers and desktop

21:35.280 --> 21:37.440
environments as I see fit.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.620
And I piece it together into my ultimate desktop environment.

21:40.620 --> 21:43.720
But I'm a little crazy with things like Linux BBQ group.

21:43.720 --> 21:49.880
I use terminal programs like RSI and UmC Pop and Piano Bar, etc. when I can.

21:49.880 --> 21:54.080
And I've been known to throw some heavy gooey apps on the screen when I need or want to.

21:54.080 --> 22:00.440
So I want to say, give it a little time, have some fun with it, get inspired, and follow

22:00.440 --> 22:05.920
other people and their configs, like unixporn.reddit.com, which is, by the way, unixporn.reddit.com is

22:05.920 --> 22:08.560
a great place to be inspired by your desktop config.

22:08.560 --> 22:12.840
And I love to hear how you guys fared after some much-deserved vacation time.

22:12.840 --> 22:16.720
I wish both of you and your families a Merry Christmas, phyllo, polio, math.

22:16.720 --> 22:20.800
Well, you know, I never thought at 40 years old I'd be saying, hey, Chris, let's go check

22:20.800 --> 22:21.800
out this gangbang.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.600
But apparently that's what we're going to be doing.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.560
I like that it's got barbecue in the name too, Matt.

22:25.560 --> 22:26.840
It's like totally right up my alley.

22:26.840 --> 22:27.840
Well, and it's got barbecue.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.440
And if it has the barbecue sauce, then we've made the connection.

22:30.440 --> 22:36.240
So one of the things, this is just a big go figure.

22:36.240 --> 22:40.920
I haven't been using my Bonobo for the last couple episodes of the Linux Action Show,

22:40.920 --> 22:42.640
but I have on my Bonobo.

22:42.640 --> 22:49.020
I think zeroed in on the most amazing KDE configuration that has ever been conceived

22:49.020 --> 22:50.120
on the planet Earth.

22:50.120 --> 22:54.200
I mean, I look at it, I'm looking at it right now because you're Skyping in on it.

22:54.200 --> 22:59.400
I mean, Matt, I'm telling you, I look at the screen and it is like a freaking piece of

22:59.400 --> 23:00.400
art.

23:00.400 --> 23:05.240
So now I got this pressure from the Linux Action Show audience to try out these tiling

23:05.240 --> 23:06.240
window managers.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.240
I mean, here I am.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.560
I got KDE just the way I like it.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.560
Yeah.

23:09.560 --> 23:13.360
I mean, it's apples and oranges as far as what you're gaining from each.

23:13.360 --> 23:17.240
I mean, the tiling windows manager, I guess is, I still don't really understand the appeal.

23:17.240 --> 23:21.000
I guess it's for, if you have limited screen real estate, you want a lot of stuff up at

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
once.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
No, I think I got it.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
I think I got it.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
So what I discovered when I did the Arch challenge and which ended up appealing to me is I kind

23:28.000 --> 23:33.680
of was, I was taking all of my experience from every other distro that I've used and

23:33.680 --> 23:39.320
bringing it together in one configuration that I really liked.

23:39.320 --> 23:43.240
And what I mean by that is because you pick at each layer in Arch what you want to use

23:43.240 --> 23:46.440
from your sound system to your font rendering, right?

23:46.440 --> 23:48.440
And so I knew I liked this from this distro.

23:48.440 --> 23:50.220
I like this from this distro.

23:50.220 --> 23:56.200
And at the end, even though it's labeled Arch Linux, it's basically Chris's OS.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.600
It is exactly like my custom built system.

23:59.600 --> 24:00.600
And so what?

24:00.600 --> 24:01.760
Two things.

24:01.760 --> 24:06.200
On a rolling release, the more complex your GUI is, you know, Gnome and KDE, the more

24:06.200 --> 24:11.200
complex it is, I got to believe the more higher likelihood it's going to break on a rolling

24:11.200 --> 24:12.200
release.

24:12.200 --> 24:18.200
So there could be motivation when you're using a rolling release to stick with a more simple

24:18.200 --> 24:22.880
streamlined window manager that something like i3 or Awesome because it's less likely

24:22.880 --> 24:23.880
to break.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.100
So I think that could be one motivating factor.

24:26.100 --> 24:32.880
But second of all, like Polymath is saying here, he's pulling in the terminal programs

24:32.880 --> 24:33.880
he likes.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.640
He's pulling in the file manager he likes.

24:35.640 --> 24:41.000
He brings in the compositor that he thinks has the fanciest or whatever effects he likes.

24:41.000 --> 24:46.000
And he is essentially taking that philosophy of building your core Linux system and he's

24:46.000 --> 24:50.300
bringing it all the way up to building the whole entire desktop environment, right?

24:50.300 --> 24:53.180
It's like the ultimate customized system.

24:53.180 --> 24:58.000
It's like you custom build your car and you even custom build the dashboard display, right?

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
And I guess that's what it is.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.800
I think the dashboard display is really what people are into, I guess, with this.

25:03.800 --> 25:04.800
That's tough.

25:04.800 --> 25:05.800
Yeah.

25:05.800 --> 25:06.800
I get it.

25:06.800 --> 25:07.800
Because I get it.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.320
Because like with Arch, it's like I totally get that because it's like you're customizing

25:10.320 --> 25:11.320
your experience.

25:11.320 --> 25:15.600
With this, you must be customizing your user experience, but it just seems so minimalist.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.360
I guess that's kind of what you're going for.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.360
I don't know.

25:18.360 --> 25:23.720
KZ 50 Cents in the chat room is that TWM can really look cool, but dang, Chris Ellis needs

25:23.720 --> 25:25.000
his KDE Connect.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
You know what?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.000
He jokes.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
But I like my KDE Connect.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.200
I like my widgets and I like my photo slideshow on my desktop, right?

25:33.200 --> 25:37.880
I like having my CPU meters on the desktop and in my menu bar.

25:37.880 --> 25:43.320
So I mean, because for a lower end machine or an older computer, I can totally see going

25:43.320 --> 25:46.480
minimalist as much as possible, but for a higher end machine, it's just kind of like

25:46.480 --> 25:50.640
I would have to understand the psychology behind the reasoning behind it more.

25:50.640 --> 25:54.680
From a financially sensible standpoint, from a practical standpoint, from a system resources

25:54.680 --> 25:57.160
standpoint, I can totally understand it.

25:57.160 --> 25:59.080
But from a...

25:59.080 --> 26:00.080
I want Shiny.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.080
Yeah.

26:01.080 --> 26:02.080
And here's why.

26:02.080 --> 26:08.880
I'm not qualified in wanting Shiny because I have lived through all of it, okay?

26:08.880 --> 26:11.600
So you're not...

26:11.600 --> 26:12.680
It's not quaint for me.

26:12.680 --> 26:16.080
It's not quaint for me to have the computer that can't figure something out, where I have

26:16.080 --> 26:17.680
to tell it to do something.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.520
That's not fun.

26:19.520 --> 26:22.160
That's something computers should be good at by now.

26:22.160 --> 26:26.880
And I sit in the camp where I want my goddamn window to wiggle because damn it, I lived

26:26.880 --> 26:33.400
through a time when we didn't even have separated GPU cards, and then we had Matrox video cards,

26:33.400 --> 26:36.680
had to have special video games, and you had to have all of these special drivers.

26:36.680 --> 26:41.600
I lived through all of it, and now I want to reap the rewards of being there on the

26:41.600 --> 26:47.720
front lines, trying everything out, pushing things forward, talking about them, experiencing

26:47.720 --> 26:53.360
them, blowing my money on crap that never worked out, but the few things that did succeed.

26:53.360 --> 26:57.760
I have worked so damn hard over the last 15, 20 years.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.960
Why would I forfeit all of that now to just give it all up?

27:00.960 --> 27:02.460
And it's not that I don't...

27:02.460 --> 27:06.160
I just don't disparage anybody who chooses to do so because there are completely legitimate

27:06.160 --> 27:12.720
reasons that I just laid out, but for me personally, I feel like kind of like going back to Thor,

27:12.720 --> 27:17.480
I have defended the realms, I have earned my right to party now, and I want to party

27:17.480 --> 27:19.520
like it's 2013.

27:19.520 --> 27:20.640
Is that so crazy?

27:20.640 --> 27:22.300
Is that really so ridiculous?

27:22.300 --> 27:26.600
Just because I run Linux doesn't mean I shouldn't party like it's 2013.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.600
I don't think it's crazy.

27:27.600 --> 27:29.600
I think it's pretty reasonable, actually.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.840
It's interesting that there's a collective mindset for that.

27:32.840 --> 27:38.560
And there's certainly, again, I'm still trying to understand the desire to go with that whole

27:38.560 --> 27:41.000
minimalist point of view, but for me, yeah.

27:41.000 --> 27:46.180
Why do we feel like we have to make do unless there is actually an advantage to that that

27:46.180 --> 27:47.180
we're not aware of?

27:47.180 --> 27:48.180
Right.

27:48.180 --> 27:49.180
No.

27:49.180 --> 27:50.180
My desktop should be as absolutely freaking badass as possible.

27:50.180 --> 27:56.000
That's why I am personally willing to spend a $500 premium or whatever it is to buy a

27:56.000 --> 28:01.120
machine that is resource capable of delivering that, and when I cannot afford to do so, I

28:01.120 --> 28:02.120
just don't buy.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.120
Right.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.120
Right.

28:04.120 --> 28:08.180
And then I, you know, anyways, I just, so, but here's what I'm willing to, I was very

28:08.180 --> 28:11.000
opinionated about the whole Arch thing to begin with.

28:11.000 --> 28:17.160
I think if you look back at 2013, that was obviously a big lesson for Chris and Matt

28:17.160 --> 28:19.000
was this whole, yeah, right?

28:19.000 --> 28:24.160
So I'm totally willing to give the tiling window managers a go because I do grok the

28:24.160 --> 28:28.760
benefit of like extending that custom built feeling all the way off to the very top to

28:28.760 --> 28:30.400
layer seven right there with me.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.400
I get it.

28:31.400 --> 28:35.440
I'm willing to give it a go because at the end I might walk away and say, oh my God,

28:35.440 --> 28:39.720
everybody, the real light is totally tuning in the perfect desktop that makes you the

28:39.720 --> 28:42.720
ultimate product, productive son of a bitch, right?

28:42.720 --> 28:43.720
Oh yeah.

28:43.720 --> 28:44.720
And then I'll be all on board.

28:44.720 --> 28:48.400
But until that point, right now I'm just saying from somebody who hasn't jumped into the tiling

28:48.400 --> 28:52.000
window manager challenge yet, I think you guys are a bunch of crazy son of a bitches,

28:52.000 --> 28:53.400
but I'm willing to jump in with you.

28:53.400 --> 28:57.600
Well, so it's like, okay, imagine Tron re-imagined with the awesome window manager.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.200
Are you going to want to see that on the big screen?

29:00.200 --> 29:01.200
Wow.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.960
That, that, that literally looks like flash Gordon from the forties or thirties or whatever

29:04.960 --> 29:05.960
the hell it was.

29:05.960 --> 29:08.160
It's just kind of like why, you know?

29:08.160 --> 29:11.880
But again, there may be something to these windows managers that are besides performance

29:11.880 --> 29:13.400
increase that I'm not aware of.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.560
Maybe it's, it does something for me that I'm just not cluing in on.

29:16.560 --> 29:19.560
You know, I'll tell you one of the things when I sit down in front of a Mac that drives

29:19.560 --> 29:24.480
me totally wonky crazy is like the totally mixed keyboard support.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.600
I do totally grok.

29:26.600 --> 29:31.560
Like, and honestly, when I sit down in windows, like I love back when I was a consultant,

29:31.560 --> 29:35.560
I loved the problems when the mouse wasn't working because I was like, F yeah.

29:35.560 --> 29:36.560
What's up?

29:36.560 --> 29:37.560
It's all keyboard time.

29:37.560 --> 29:38.560
Cause everything was just right at the keyboard.

29:38.560 --> 29:41.120
And I can totally see how that's great on a tiling window manager.

29:41.120 --> 29:43.360
I love the F out of that on KDE.

29:43.360 --> 29:47.480
So maybe I'll, you know, I'll throw away my mouse, I'll become one with the keyboard and

29:47.480 --> 29:49.120
it's tiling managers from here on out.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.260
But we won't find out until early into 2014.

29:52.260 --> 29:54.240
Let those gray hairs start coming into the beard there.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.240
Yeah.

29:55.240 --> 29:56.560
I mean, total graveyard on it.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.560
You know, I don't know that that's, that's a toughie, but I definitely think that it's

29:59.560 --> 30:01.460
going to be interesting to see how that pans out.

30:01.460 --> 30:02.460
But I don't know, man.

30:02.460 --> 30:03.460
We'll try it.

30:03.460 --> 30:04.460
We'll find out skeptical.

30:04.460 --> 30:08.000
It'll be a, I don't know when, cause we got like, we got a lot of things coming up, but

30:08.000 --> 30:11.200
I want to tell you about something else I'm passionate about and that is Ting.com now

30:11.200 --> 30:14.520
Ting are sponsors right here of Linux Unplugged.

30:14.520 --> 30:17.880
Ting is mobile that makes sense because there's no contracts, there's no early termination

30:17.880 --> 30:18.880
fee.

30:18.880 --> 30:19.880
And here's the part that makes the most sense.

30:19.880 --> 30:20.880
You only pay for what you use.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.740
It's a $6 flat line and then it's just, they just take your messages, your minutes and

30:24.740 --> 30:26.900
your megabytes and they add it up at the end of the month.

30:26.900 --> 30:28.960
You buy your phone, you own it outright.

30:28.960 --> 30:32.800
And what's brilliant about Ting is not only do they have a support staff of Canadians

30:32.800 --> 30:36.800
ready to answer your call as it comes up, Ting is from the guys that made two cows.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.640
They've been changing this stuff for a long time.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.840
Everything Ting gets into or everything two cows gets into, they really want to make a

30:41.840 --> 30:42.840
difference.

30:42.840 --> 30:46.400
Ting is very passionate about this because they feel there is big changes to be made

30:46.400 --> 30:49.040
in the mobile industry and let's be honest, there are.

30:49.040 --> 30:53.360
Because all of these mobile plans you buy into adds a ton of waste to your monthly budget.

30:53.360 --> 30:57.400
You pay into some sort of minutes or megabytes you don't end up using or you go over where

30:57.400 --> 31:00.680
Ting will just take your messages, your minutes and your megabytes, add them all up at the

31:00.680 --> 31:01.680
end of the month.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.880
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay for.

31:03.880 --> 31:07.320
Unlimited devices on your account for just $6 per month.

31:07.320 --> 31:10.560
So if you're a small business, if you're a family, if you're a team of folks, you can

31:10.560 --> 31:11.560
make it super easy.

31:11.560 --> 31:15.880
If you're a developer or if you're IT support and you need to have multiple iterations of

31:15.880 --> 31:20.600
Android devices or Blackberry devices or Windows to phones or even the iPhone 4 or 4S which

31:20.600 --> 31:24.640
now work on Ting and you want to have them on one account so that way you can test things

31:24.640 --> 31:28.840
for your clients, for your apps, whoever it is, Ting makes that super easy because you

31:28.840 --> 31:31.040
only pay for what you use on those devices.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.560
Add a whole bunch on your account.

31:32.560 --> 31:35.720
You just pay that flat $6 and then what you use on top of that.

31:35.720 --> 31:40.480
That makes testing super straightforward plus when you combine that with the Ting dashboard,

31:40.480 --> 31:44.320
you're really cooking with gas because it's a super simple interface that also gives you

31:44.320 --> 31:48.880
tons of controls from activating, deactivating devices, setting up call forwarding, voicemail

31:48.880 --> 31:49.880
rules.

31:49.880 --> 31:54.480
Matt, when you signed up for Ting, did you call or did you use the online dashboard completely?

31:54.480 --> 31:58.100
I used the online dashboard completely and that was what was awesome because even when

31:58.100 --> 32:02.680
I had to basically deattach you from it and then reattach myself from it, I was able to

32:02.680 --> 32:06.360
figure out how to do that completely from their help file or their help section which

32:06.360 --> 32:11.320
is super easy to use and literally did that, boom, done, completed, refreshed my dashboard.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.320
I was good to go.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.080
I couldn't believe how stupid simple it was.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.080
It was great.

32:15.080 --> 32:19.400
You know, when I got my Nexus 5 from the Google Play Store, it came in the Ting portfolio

32:19.400 --> 32:21.280
and in there they had just a little business card.

32:21.280 --> 32:22.280
You pull out the business card.

32:22.280 --> 32:26.240
It says go to Ting.com like slash activate or something like that and it's just step

32:26.240 --> 32:28.560
by step by step all through the web interface.

32:28.560 --> 32:32.420
I never had to call but I always know if I get a position where I need to call, a real

32:32.420 --> 32:35.920
support representative, if you call between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern will answer that

32:35.920 --> 32:40.160
phone and they really are empowered not only to solve the problem but they're actually

32:40.160 --> 32:44.740
enthusiasts of Android and all the other mobile devices that Ting carries.

32:44.740 --> 32:47.760
That's something they specialize in which is really kind of peace of mind.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.680
You recommend to family, you know, that kind of thing.

32:49.680 --> 32:54.120
Well and totally the one takeaway if I could like institute one thing to everybody and

32:54.120 --> 32:58.000
just really push this forward, they don't live on scripts and having dealt with the

32:58.000 --> 33:02.240
various companies recently that are script based, you're going to love that.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.240
Alone.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.680
I mean that by itself just makes my day.

33:04.680 --> 33:09.440
Yeah Ting hires their support representatives are folks who are champions of mobile and

33:09.440 --> 33:13.280
Android in their peer groups and so Ting says why don't you come work for us and help out

33:13.280 --> 33:14.280
our customers.

33:14.280 --> 33:15.280
So here's how you get started.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.280
Go over to linux.ting.com.

33:16.280 --> 33:23.000
That'll take $25 off your first month of service or it'll take $25 off your first device if

33:23.000 --> 33:24.000
you don't have one yet.

33:24.000 --> 33:28.200
They are an MMO of the Sprint Network so if you have good Sprint service in your area,

33:28.200 --> 33:29.920
you're going to get amazing Ting service.

33:29.920 --> 33:35.880
Go to linux.ting.com and a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

33:35.880 --> 33:40.040
Alright so brace yourself for this one guys.

33:40.040 --> 33:47.480
I've got the Times, the Time Magazine top 10 tech gadgets of the year.

33:47.480 --> 33:52.320
Number 10, I won't go through all of these, don't worry, it's not going to be that boring.

33:52.320 --> 33:58.160
Number 10, the Nokia Lumia 1020, okay, it's got a good camera, I mean it does, it has

33:58.160 --> 33:59.160
a good camera.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.360
Well that's like saying a cinder block has a great camera.

34:01.360 --> 34:06.360
I mean okay, you take a cinder block and I tape a really great camera to it, but really?

34:06.360 --> 34:12.600
Xbox One made number 6, Apple iPhone 5S made number 5, Pebble Smartwatch number 4, Oculus

34:12.600 --> 34:20.200
Rift number 3, Apple's new iPad number 2, but the number one Time Magazine gadget of

34:20.200 --> 34:27.160
the year is the Google Chromecast, a Linux based device.

34:27.160 --> 34:28.160
Can you hear that?

34:28.160 --> 34:30.880
Honestly, can you hear the sound of the residual checks being cached?

34:30.880 --> 34:32.240
I can.

34:32.240 --> 34:37.560
So I have a Google Chromecast and Matt, I've got to be honest, I have not really had an

34:37.560 --> 34:38.560
opportunity to try it out.

34:38.560 --> 34:42.920
I just don't understand why, I genuinely don't get why anyone, I don't understand.

34:42.920 --> 34:47.600
How about this, Sunday, remind me, why don't you take my Chromecast home and try it out?

34:47.600 --> 34:51.440
I'll try it out because maybe I'll hate on it, because for me it's just kind of like,

34:51.440 --> 34:54.440
if you don't have an existing option, okay cool, that's awesome.

34:54.440 --> 34:59.880
So here's the advantage, okay, so it's a little device, you plug into your HDMI port, you

34:59.880 --> 35:03.520
also need to have USB power nearby or they include an adapter.

35:03.520 --> 35:09.040
It runs Gen 2 Linux with a Chrome OS binary that runs in the background, and from your

35:09.040 --> 35:14.840
Android device you can come across a Netflix video, a YouTube video, Plex now has support

35:14.840 --> 35:15.840
for Chromecast.

35:15.840 --> 35:18.600
Oh, okay, well now I'm starting to care.

35:18.600 --> 35:19.600
Right?

35:19.600 --> 35:23.520
Okay, so picture this, you take the Plex app, you put it on your Note 2, okay, because first

35:23.520 --> 35:27.000
of all, Note 2 has an amazing screen for watching Plex videos.

35:27.000 --> 35:34.920
So but $35 for the Chromecast, okay, so you could put a Chromecast on every TV in the

35:34.920 --> 35:40.520
house that has an HDMI port for $35, you start Plex on the phone, you select your video,

35:40.520 --> 35:47.800
you hit play, you say send to Plex, or you say send to Chromecast, it sends the commands

35:47.800 --> 35:51.560
and it creates the connection between your Plex server and the Chromecast directly, and

35:51.560 --> 35:55.520
then you can turn your phone off, and now you don't have to have a Roku, you don't have

35:55.520 --> 36:00.000
to have anything else, you just have to have a $35 Chromecast connected to your TV, and

36:00.000 --> 36:04.480
you can send your Plex media to it, you can send your Netflix, your music, those kinds

36:04.480 --> 36:05.480
of things.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.600
So the differentiator as far as like why you and I would care, for example, is that for

36:08.600 --> 36:11.400
us right now to run Plex, we're actually using a computer.

36:11.400 --> 36:12.400
I'm using or a Roku.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.400
Or a Roku, yeah, well, I mean, for the computer to stream.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.920
You still have to have a Plex server, you still have to have a Plex server with the

36:16.920 --> 36:17.920
Chromecast.

36:17.920 --> 36:18.920
Right, exactly.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.720
Okay, so even with the Chromecast you still have to have a Plex server then, because that

36:20.720 --> 36:24.280
was really my big thing, is that it sounds like, because I know there's actually AirPlay

36:24.280 --> 36:28.560
options for Roku, be it they're not awesome, I mean, they definitely have a long way to

36:28.560 --> 36:33.040
go, but yeah, I'm going to have to play with it and really wrap my head around it.

36:33.040 --> 36:34.040
There's another limit, though.

36:34.040 --> 36:35.040
What?

36:35.040 --> 36:40.160
The Chromecast Plex support requires the Plex subscription to send anything at all through

36:40.160 --> 36:41.160
Plex.

36:41.160 --> 36:42.160
Yeah, you've got to have the Plex Pass.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.160
Yeah.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.160
That's fine.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.160
I mean, Plex is so awesome, it's just usual.

36:45.160 --> 36:48.640
I have a Plex Pass because it is so awesome, but here's what Time Magazine says.

36:48.640 --> 36:53.040
They said, instead of trying to do everything, like Google's famously ambitious and unsuccessful

36:53.040 --> 36:59.480
Google TV, this thumb-sized gizmo does one thing and does it simply as possible and does

36:59.480 --> 37:02.720
it for the impulse purchasing price of $35.

37:02.720 --> 37:07.200
Plug it into one of your TV's HDMI ports and you can fling videos and other content from

37:07.200 --> 37:13.040
your laptop, your tablet, or your phone to the big screen with no wires involved.

37:13.040 --> 37:16.360
Lots of companies have built devices to do this, but Chromecast is the first one to get

37:16.360 --> 37:17.360
it right.

37:17.360 --> 37:24.320
But another important point to point out, wow, is you can get an extension for Chrome

37:24.320 --> 37:27.040
and you can send individual tabs to Chromecast.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.640
Now that I care about.

37:28.640 --> 37:31.920
So you're saying that I could go to like abc.com and actually send that to my account.

37:31.920 --> 37:32.920
Now I care.

37:32.920 --> 37:33.920
Right.

37:33.920 --> 37:34.920
Now I care.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.920
That doesn't work very well, though.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.920
I would expect not to work too well, but...

37:36.920 --> 37:37.920
Question, though.

37:37.920 --> 37:44.440
Why couldn't you just get a $5, 10-gig USB stick and put XB and C on there?

37:44.440 --> 37:50.240
Like XB and C would do or something like that on there and it would be way better.

37:50.240 --> 37:56.440
Well, I mean, for us, yes, but for the average user, what we have is we have a really big

37:56.440 --> 38:01.920
problem in the living room and Chromecast is, first of all, it's solving the price point,

38:01.920 --> 38:09.800
but the beauty is, is everybody's got a smartphone now and all you need is the $35 Chromecast

38:09.800 --> 38:10.960
and a smartphone.

38:10.960 --> 38:15.240
They see each other like some kind of internet magic and you just push a button on your smart

38:15.240 --> 38:20.520
device and it just sends it to your TV and it is very simple and I'll be honest, until

38:20.520 --> 38:25.120
you've tried it, it doesn't sound like it's that amazing, but we've got an iPad and an

38:25.120 --> 38:26.120
Apple TV.

38:26.120 --> 38:29.160
Well, not anymore, but we used to have an Apple TV in the house that my dad got me for

38:29.160 --> 38:31.840
Christmas a couple of years ago, which I don't have anymore, but...

38:31.840 --> 38:32.840
Oh, yeah.

38:32.840 --> 38:33.840
We got a jailbroken one.

38:33.840 --> 38:34.840
Yeah, totally.

38:34.840 --> 38:38.240
That whole like you're on the iPad and you push one button and all of a sudden everything

38:38.240 --> 38:42.320
you're watching on the iPad, on the TV, and it is so effing seamless and then you can

38:42.320 --> 38:45.520
like continue to use the device for other things.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.840
It honestly feels like the effing future.

38:47.840 --> 38:52.720
It feels like what 2013 should feel like and Chromecast brings that down to $35 and anybody

38:52.720 --> 38:55.320
that wants to build that into their Android app.

38:55.320 --> 38:58.480
It's interesting because like a lot of people probably don't know this, the Roku, I think

38:58.480 --> 39:03.600
it's the Roku LT, oddly enough, experienced a recent price drop to I think $35, oddly

39:03.600 --> 39:04.600
again.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.560
Obviously, the timing is just perfect for that.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.360
So it's going to be interesting to see how they stack up because I think I have one of

39:09.360 --> 39:11.760
the XT or whatever the hell it is.

39:11.760 --> 39:15.060
And just to kind of get an idea on performance, what its capabilities are, does it really

39:15.060 --> 39:16.060
woo me?

39:16.060 --> 39:18.040
Because I'm a rabid Roku fan.

39:18.040 --> 39:22.880
The problem is all of these things are not, in my opinion, good enough.

39:22.880 --> 39:27.640
So first of all, the number one problem with the Chromecast is tied to Google.

39:27.640 --> 39:30.280
I don't like that.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.860
Second problem with the Chromecast is it's tied to Android.

39:32.860 --> 39:34.200
Not a huge fan of that.

39:34.200 --> 39:39.640
XBMC is great, but doesn't solve the AirPlay-like functionality, and I think that's a big gap.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.640
It is.

39:40.640 --> 39:44.840
I run XBMC on my old jailbroken Apple TV, and honestly, ever since moving to Plex, I

39:44.840 --> 39:46.960
just don't really use it anymore.

39:46.960 --> 39:55.400
It does actually solve the XBMC thing, or XBMC solves it because I'm building a project

39:55.400 --> 39:56.400
to solve it.

39:56.400 --> 39:57.400
Tell me about it.

39:57.400 --> 39:58.400
What do you mean?

39:58.400 --> 40:01.120
I'm calling it XBeamMC.

40:01.120 --> 40:06.760
So you beam the stuff from your laptop or your desktop to XBMC and play it however

40:06.760 --> 40:07.760
you want.

40:07.760 --> 40:13.320
It's going to support everything that you're talking about, like YouTube.

40:13.320 --> 40:18.360
For Chromecast, you require Plex to do local files, so you require a subscription to do

40:18.360 --> 40:19.360
local.

40:19.360 --> 40:22.220
Otherwise, Chromecast can't do local files.

40:22.220 --> 40:28.300
For XBMC, it supports everything that XBMC can support, so MKVs, MP4s, whatever.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.240
Local files, internet files, streaming.

40:30.240 --> 40:32.960
So it's just like an app you install in XBMC?

40:32.960 --> 40:35.320
No, it's an app for Linux.

40:35.320 --> 40:40.800
So you load XBMC on top of Linux, and then on the Linux system, you install the XBMC

40:40.800 --> 40:41.800
beam, the XBeam...

40:41.800 --> 40:47.200
Right, but it also works with any kind of XBMC, regardless of what you put it on.

40:47.200 --> 40:51.680
So it works on Raspbmc, like the Raspberry Pi and things like that.

40:51.680 --> 40:56.120
So you can just right click on YouTube, send to XBMC, it'll send it to it and start playing

40:56.120 --> 40:57.120
immediately.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.120
Very cool.

40:58.120 --> 40:59.400
Sounds rather cool.

40:59.400 --> 41:02.760
What is the ETA?

41:02.760 --> 41:04.320
Probably like a week or two weeks.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.320
Nice.

41:05.320 --> 41:06.320
Cool.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.320
Keep us posted, Dennis.

41:07.320 --> 41:08.720
And it plays from where you're at on your local...

41:08.720 --> 41:10.440
It'll pick up from wherever you're at?

41:10.440 --> 41:12.080
Doesn't start the video over?

41:12.080 --> 41:13.560
It depends.

41:13.560 --> 41:14.560
If you're...

41:14.560 --> 41:18.380
It can kind of do that, but it's really...

41:18.380 --> 41:22.800
If the plugin for XBMC supports that, it can do it.

41:22.800 --> 41:24.440
If that plugin does not, it will not.

41:24.440 --> 41:28.400
See, that's important for me, and what I really dig about the Chromecast is podcasts and videos

41:28.400 --> 41:32.760
that I'm watching on my way home, I walk inside and I put them on my TV.

41:32.760 --> 41:35.200
So it like picks up where you left off.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.320
What app are you using to do that?

41:37.320 --> 41:38.320
That's just Chromecast.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.200
So it's a YouTube thing.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.800
But oh, so you're watching like...

41:41.800 --> 41:44.040
So say you'd watch Linux unplugged on YouTube and then...

41:44.040 --> 41:45.240
Yeah, it's usually you guys.

41:45.240 --> 41:51.720
So it's whatever podcast, BeyondPod on my Android or whatever through Chrome I'm doing.

41:51.720 --> 41:55.480
Does BeyondPod support Chromecast?

41:55.480 --> 41:57.480
It does if you pay for it.

41:57.480 --> 42:00.640
Well, I'm interested in the plugin myself.

42:00.640 --> 42:03.680
I'm interested in seeing how that works with XBMC, because that appeals to me.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.440
I like the fact it's not Google.

42:06.440 --> 42:11.680
Mine will also support the time thing for YouTube, so that you can play it, but it might

42:11.680 --> 42:13.040
not for other ones.

42:13.040 --> 42:16.080
But I'm going to try to support it as much as I can.

42:16.080 --> 42:19.920
But the main thing is like the first version might not have all the features that Chromecast

42:19.920 --> 42:22.000
does because I'm not Google.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.480
Exactly right.

42:23.480 --> 42:26.960
You kind of lack the billions of dollars and endless resources, totally.

42:26.960 --> 42:32.720
It feels like though, here we are, like Google is getting closer to cracking this problem

42:32.720 --> 42:35.360
than Myth TV has, than XBMC.

42:35.360 --> 42:39.440
Well, I don't know if that's appropriate, but like for the masses, right?

42:39.440 --> 42:40.440
This whole...

42:40.440 --> 42:44.420
The whole like the smarts and intelligence and the picking and the content selection

42:44.420 --> 42:46.760
is all done from the mobile device.

42:46.760 --> 42:50.200
And then the Chromecast is really like this totally stripped down little arm device that

42:50.200 --> 42:51.680
just plays the stream.

42:51.680 --> 42:55.500
Okay, well here's my thing about the casting of tabs.

42:55.500 --> 43:00.200
It's experimental right now and buggy, but as much apps as Google isn't trying to move

43:00.200 --> 43:05.240
to inside the browser, so eventually your apps will just move with you onto whatever

43:05.240 --> 43:09.800
device you've got your Chromecast plugged into.

43:09.800 --> 43:15.020
Well, that's one of the cool things about it and maybe even Netflix at some point can

43:15.020 --> 43:16.020
do that.

43:16.020 --> 43:21.720
But for right now, like for example, Amazon is a horrible experience because it does not

43:21.720 --> 43:22.720
work.

43:22.720 --> 43:27.880
So you can kind of like give it some work around and like wiggle it around and it sometimes

43:27.880 --> 43:30.360
will work, but for most time it doesn't.

43:30.360 --> 43:36.360
Well, I do SSH sessions in my browser on people's computers that I don't want to install anything

43:36.360 --> 43:37.360
on.

43:37.360 --> 43:42.200
I can just within Chrome do an SSH session and it's really interesting to be able to

43:42.200 --> 43:44.400
see what else I'm going to be able to Chromecast.

43:44.400 --> 43:50.320
Well, to me, I mean the thing is like the Chromecast in a sense almost solves the front

43:50.320 --> 43:52.200
end problem.

43:52.200 --> 43:57.460
To me, the Plex solution seems like the superior solution because I take one of these $35 dongles

43:57.460 --> 44:02.140
and I plug them into my HDMI TV and then I have a central Plex server that has one centralized

44:02.140 --> 44:07.160
library of all of my media, one index, everything's, if it's marked watched once on TV, it's marked

44:07.160 --> 44:09.040
watched everywhere else.

44:09.040 --> 44:12.880
It's all one place plus it has the mobile aspect where I can watch videos out on the

44:12.880 --> 44:14.520
go on my mobile device.

44:14.520 --> 44:20.920
It seems like to me, Chromecast is going to usher in, I don't want to say this, but I

44:20.920 --> 44:25.720
think it begins to – I think it's the first nail in the coffin of things like XBMC

44:25.720 --> 44:26.720
and Myth TV.

44:26.720 --> 44:35.320
Well, the XBMC thing is that what Chromecast brings to the same – like XBMC does all

44:35.320 --> 44:40.940
this stuff but the problem is that it requires you to install the piece by piece to make

44:40.940 --> 44:42.040
it all work.

44:42.040 --> 44:46.200
Like there's for saying something has been watched, you can do that but it requires a

44:46.200 --> 44:53.760
plug-in for that and for like mine, it requires – my app is going to require certain types

44:53.760 --> 44:54.760
of plug-ins.

44:54.760 --> 44:57.480
For example, XBMC does not come with YouTube by default.

44:57.480 --> 45:01.480
You have to install the YouTube plug-in and it all works just fine.

45:01.480 --> 45:06.640
It's just there's a kind of an introduction kind of thing you need to know how to install

45:06.640 --> 45:08.120
the plug-ins and things like that.

45:08.120 --> 45:11.840
Well, I also think they're two totally different audiences too because if you think about it,

45:11.840 --> 45:14.880
I mean Chromecast is essentially, like it or not, it's a hardware appliance.

45:14.880 --> 45:16.560
I mean it really at its core really is.

45:16.560 --> 45:18.200
It's something you physically plug into your TV.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.200
Right.

45:19.200 --> 45:20.200
Isn't that perfect though because it's not a whole computer.

45:20.200 --> 45:21.200
It's not a PC.

45:21.200 --> 45:22.200
Yeah, it is.

45:22.200 --> 45:23.200
No, that's good.

45:23.200 --> 45:24.200
It's $35.

45:24.200 --> 45:28.360
Yeah, but XBMC, it's like Plex didn't kill XBMC and they're related, I mean they're

45:28.360 --> 45:29.360
cousins to each other.

45:29.360 --> 45:32.000
They're based on some of the same code and all that or a lot of the same code but the

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
point is –

45:33.000 --> 45:34.760
I don't know if it will kill it.

45:34.760 --> 45:41.920
But how much of the price of the Google device is offset by Google's plans to make money

45:41.920 --> 45:45.120
off it from advertising or selling media and other things?

45:45.120 --> 45:46.120
Right.

45:46.120 --> 45:47.120
Oh, yeah.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.120
Let's Google track.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.120
Yeah.

45:49.120 --> 45:50.120
Tracking your TV habits.

45:50.120 --> 45:51.120
But the average user doesn't know that though.

45:51.120 --> 45:52.120
Right.

45:52.120 --> 45:55.320
I'm just saying that it will be hard for someone else to build a competing device to

45:55.320 --> 45:58.680
the Google one because they can't afford to lose money on it by Google again.

45:58.680 --> 45:59.680
Right.

45:59.680 --> 46:00.680
Exactly.

46:00.680 --> 46:01.680
That's true.

46:01.680 --> 46:02.680
Well, XBMC also works on Raspberry Pi.

46:02.680 --> 46:05.480
And you can't kill XBMC because it's open source.

46:05.480 --> 46:08.520
So like naturally, there's always going to be somebody that's going to want to continue

46:08.520 --> 46:09.520
it.

46:09.520 --> 46:10.520
It's kind of a different approach.

46:10.520 --> 46:14.720
It's kind of a different approach to the same problem but one thing I've been waiting

46:14.720 --> 46:19.840
for for a long time now is Wi-Fi direct on Linux because, I mean, you get a wireless

46:19.840 --> 46:24.400
display straight from your laptop but Intel refuses to support it under Linux.

46:24.400 --> 46:28.440
But if they did, I could just hit a button on my laptop and have everything on my laptop

46:28.440 --> 46:29.440
on my TV.

46:29.440 --> 46:30.760
And for that, that would solve it for me.

46:30.760 --> 46:31.760
Yeah.

46:31.760 --> 46:32.760
Not everybody has embraced Wi-Di.

46:32.760 --> 46:38.440
And I feel like the Chromecast is still – like it's just at $35, it really is that impulse

46:38.440 --> 46:39.960
purchase price on Amazon.

46:39.960 --> 46:43.800
Like I add it to my cart, I just buy it and it doesn't matter if my TV has Wi-Di support

46:43.800 --> 46:44.800
or DLNA.

46:44.800 --> 46:48.640
All they need is an HDMI port and I know my Android device can support it.

46:48.640 --> 46:53.880
And I feel like now that Plex has supported it, it is now incumbent upon XBMC to support

46:53.880 --> 46:59.640
transmitting to the Chromecast or they're going to get left behind because it is – let's

46:59.640 --> 47:07.280
be honest, I love XBMC but if I can get almost the same exact results and actually, in some

47:07.280 --> 47:10.580
cases with my kids, it's easier for them to use a tablet, it would actually be easier

47:10.580 --> 47:15.760
for them to start a video on a tablet and send it to a Chromecast than to use XBMC.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.040
I'm going to just buy a bunch of Chromecast.

47:18.040 --> 47:22.040
There's actually a way to do that with XBMC and Android.

47:22.040 --> 47:29.320
It's a replacement app instead of using the official remote control app which is terrible.

47:29.320 --> 47:30.320
Use something called Yahtzee.

47:30.320 --> 47:31.320
Oh, I've got that.

47:31.320 --> 47:32.320
Yeah.

47:32.320 --> 47:33.320
Yeah.

47:33.320 --> 47:34.320
Yeah.

47:34.320 --> 47:37.680
So it has the same kind of features and it has a bunch of other things that are just

47:37.680 --> 47:42.600
awesome but it does have the ability to send like YouTube stuff from your Android device

47:42.600 --> 47:46.480
to XBMC, no matter what your XBMC is built on.

47:46.480 --> 47:55.480
I just hook up my laptop to my TV and use my phone to control the XBMC.

47:55.480 --> 47:59.880
The thing I kind of see this as all is one is software solutions and the other one is

47:59.880 --> 48:01.380
a hardware solution.

48:01.380 --> 48:05.840
The Chromecast is a hardware solution and it has its bonuses in that right but it also

48:05.840 --> 48:10.720
has the downside in the fact that, once again, this is something that people are going to

48:10.720 --> 48:16.120
buy and think, oh, my Chromecast is outdated because I don't have the V2 Chromecast.

48:16.120 --> 48:17.120
Whatever.

48:17.120 --> 48:20.920
Well, things like XBMC, things like that are going to be around, are going to be installable

48:20.920 --> 48:21.920
on new devices.

48:21.920 --> 48:25.080
Is that an issue when it's $35 and it seems like it's pretty much just a streaming recipient

48:25.080 --> 48:28.680
so as long as it can handle a 720p or 1080p stream, it doesn't have to be that complex.

48:28.680 --> 48:33.720
It'll probably last quite a while.

48:33.720 --> 48:38.920
Well, it's like you're at the point with XBMC and you still, you get updates, you get everything

48:38.920 --> 48:41.080
and it's essentially the same price point.

48:41.080 --> 48:42.080
Right.

48:42.080 --> 48:43.080
You don't have to go through Google.

48:43.080 --> 48:44.080
I agree.

48:44.080 --> 48:46.440
Someone should package that up and sell it as an appliance.

48:46.440 --> 48:47.440
This is what I'm saying.

48:47.440 --> 48:51.560
Well, someone in the chat room actually put up something called Airtame.com and essentially

48:51.560 --> 48:54.360
this is the Google dongle.

48:54.360 --> 48:58.640
I mean, I'm reading this over and it's like, this is the same freaking thing.

48:58.640 --> 48:59.640
Yeah.

48:59.640 --> 49:02.720
They essentially bill it as wireless HDMI for everyone.

49:02.720 --> 49:03.720
This is cool.

49:03.720 --> 49:04.720
I'm looking this over.

49:04.720 --> 49:08.240
With Airtame HDMI dongle, you can display your computer screen for Mac, Windows or Linux

49:08.240 --> 49:10.440
on your TV or projector wirelessly.

49:10.440 --> 49:11.440
Now this is...

49:11.440 --> 49:12.440
An Indiegogo thing.

49:12.440 --> 49:13.440
Yeah.

49:13.440 --> 49:14.440
Yeah.

49:14.440 --> 49:18.280
It's in crowdfunding mode, but it kind of does solve the problem, doesn't it?

49:18.280 --> 49:19.280
Yeah.

49:19.280 --> 49:20.280
And apparently they got their funding.

49:20.280 --> 49:21.280
So that's cool.

49:21.280 --> 49:22.280
Oh yeah, they did.

49:22.280 --> 49:23.280
Didn't they?

49:23.280 --> 49:24.280
They got over 186% of their funding.

49:24.280 --> 49:27.560
And they still have 31 days left.

49:27.560 --> 49:30.400
The issue is that this doesn't exist yet.

49:30.400 --> 49:32.920
It does not exist yet, but it's an interesting alternative.

49:32.920 --> 49:36.960
And it also kind of speaks to the fact that there will always be an alternative.

49:36.960 --> 49:42.480
But at the end of the day, between like XBMC and going with the Google dongle as well,

49:42.480 --> 49:44.080
totally different audiences of people.

49:44.080 --> 49:48.560
Really at the end of the day, Chris's wife, my wife, they don't give a rat's behind about

49:48.560 --> 49:49.560
XBMC.

49:49.560 --> 49:50.560
They don't care.

49:50.560 --> 49:51.560
They just want to watch TV.

49:51.560 --> 49:52.560
Just make it happen.

49:52.560 --> 49:57.920
And however we can as end users make that happen for the others in our house, great.

49:57.920 --> 50:01.280
Otherwise if they're just doing it on their own, they're going to go with the complete

50:01.280 --> 50:03.240
solution, whatever that happens to be, I think.

50:03.240 --> 50:04.240
Yeah.

50:04.240 --> 50:10.000
Well, the benefit of mine is that, of XBMC and the way it's built is that with my project,

50:10.000 --> 50:14.080
people can look at the code of my project and then see how you can send something XBMC

50:14.080 --> 50:15.080
and put it on whatever they want.

50:15.080 --> 50:16.080
Right.

50:16.080 --> 50:17.080
That is cool.

50:17.080 --> 50:18.080
Totally.

50:18.080 --> 50:21.400
What we need somebody to do is proctize the XBMC platform so that applications like yours

50:21.400 --> 50:23.120
have an opportunity to shine.

50:23.120 --> 50:26.240
Like Chromecast has productized streaming for Android devices.

50:26.240 --> 50:30.080
And let's be honest, really Chromecast is a response to the Apple TV because Airplay

50:30.080 --> 50:33.200
has been in iOS since like what, iOS 4 or 5?

50:33.200 --> 50:34.200
Yeah, something like that.

50:34.200 --> 50:38.560
So I mean, they're actually behind the ball on this, but they've really nailed on something.

50:38.560 --> 50:42.840
I mean, they got Time Magazine's number one gadget of the year, for whatever that's worth.

50:42.840 --> 50:45.200
The PR they get is so...

50:45.200 --> 50:46.200
It tells you something though.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.200
It tells you there's a demand.

50:47.200 --> 50:49.040
Oh no, there's definitely a demand.

50:49.040 --> 50:52.120
But it's comical because I say the Roku should have been more.

50:52.120 --> 50:53.120
So I don't know.

50:53.120 --> 50:54.120
I'll review it.

50:54.120 --> 50:55.120
It also runs Linux.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.120
Yeah.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.120
Yeah.

50:57.120 --> 50:59.800
It also runs Linux and it's quite frankly, back when it was the Netflix box generation

50:59.800 --> 51:06.120
one Roku, which I still have by the way, my rather now gone stepfather used to run this

51:06.120 --> 51:09.040
and he didn't know anything about any computers or anything else and he was able to run it

51:09.040 --> 51:10.040
with no problem.

51:10.040 --> 51:13.360
Even as it evolved, it was always usable for all generations of people.

51:13.360 --> 51:14.880
So yeah, I don't know.

51:14.880 --> 51:19.000
I think this is just a me too product based on my early impressions, but maybe not.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.000
Question.

51:20.000 --> 51:27.240
Can you root or unlock the Chromecast and install a straight up XBMC on it?

51:27.240 --> 51:31.200
I guess there was like a way to do that, but then an update got pushed out, sort of nuked

51:31.200 --> 51:32.200
it.

51:32.200 --> 51:33.200
It'll be like that.

51:33.200 --> 51:34.200
It'll be like that.

51:34.200 --> 51:35.200
It'll be like that.

51:35.200 --> 51:36.200
There was a crack to it.

51:36.200 --> 51:37.200
I still have the original OS.

51:37.200 --> 51:38.200
That's evil though, isn't it?

51:38.200 --> 51:39.200
No.

51:39.200 --> 51:40.200
That's not evil.

51:40.200 --> 51:41.200
Not evil.

51:41.200 --> 51:42.200
Not evil.

51:42.200 --> 51:43.200
I still have the original OS on my Chromecast that I'll lend to Matt.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.200
Matt can kick it around.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.280
Yeah, because I'll definitely be brutal on it.

51:46.280 --> 51:50.240
I mean, I'll be very honest about my experience with it because I'm the rabid Roku person.

51:50.240 --> 51:54.360
I have a feeling it is one of those things that you are skeptical of until you get it

51:54.360 --> 51:56.640
and then you're like, wait a minute, this is really easy.

51:56.640 --> 51:57.640
Right.

51:57.640 --> 52:02.160
Well, it's just like, because it is very easy to be like, I'm going to go down to the living

52:02.160 --> 52:03.600
room and I'm going to watch something.

52:03.600 --> 52:08.360
So as I walk into the living room, I take my Note 2 out, I start the Netflix app, I

52:08.360 --> 52:12.640
find the movie I want to watch, I tap play, I send to Chromecast and by the time my TV

52:12.640 --> 52:15.280
is turning on, the Chromecast is already streaming it.

52:15.280 --> 52:17.600
Let me ask you this because this will decide it for me right here because this is what

52:17.600 --> 52:19.720
is going to come down to my wife.

52:19.720 --> 52:21.120
How does Ange compare it to the Roku?

52:21.120 --> 52:22.120
What's her impression?

52:22.120 --> 52:25.760
Well, no, she hasn't tried it yet, but she's totally comfortable with selecting media on

52:25.760 --> 52:26.760
her mobile device.

52:26.760 --> 52:27.760
Sure.

52:27.760 --> 52:30.400
So as long as you're comfortable doing that, when you have a Chromecast on your network,

52:30.400 --> 52:34.920
a new button shows up that you just tap and then you say, send to Chromecast.

52:34.920 --> 52:35.920
Interesting.

52:35.920 --> 52:36.920
Okay.

52:36.920 --> 52:42.240
I don't want to be annoying about it, but is it okay if I shield my website for the

52:42.240 --> 52:43.240
project?

52:43.240 --> 52:44.240
Yeah, totally.

52:44.240 --> 52:45.240
Absolutely.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.240
Definitely.

52:46.240 --> 52:47.240
It's xbeamc.com.

52:47.240 --> 52:53.720
The site right now is not ready, but by the time this is aired, it will be.

52:53.720 --> 52:54.720
X-B-E-A-M-C.

52:54.720 --> 52:55.720
Okay.

52:55.720 --> 53:01.240
Is there an email alert or RSS or something just to kind of keep people up to date?

53:01.240 --> 53:02.240
You know what?

53:02.240 --> 53:03.240
You should put a link in the subreddit too.

53:03.240 --> 53:04.240
There will be tomorrow.

53:04.240 --> 53:05.240
Yeah, okay.

53:05.240 --> 53:06.240
When your site is live.

53:06.240 --> 53:07.240
I'm posting the subreddit every time.

53:07.240 --> 53:09.120
Yeah, put it in the subreddit when your site is live and people can upvote it and check

53:09.120 --> 53:10.120
it out.

53:10.120 --> 53:15.320
Isn't all of this just attempts at trying to do what we want is that our application

53:15.320 --> 53:18.040
should go from device to device seamlessly?

53:18.040 --> 53:19.040
Convergence?

53:19.040 --> 53:20.040
Basically, yeah.

53:20.040 --> 53:21.040
Hello.

53:21.040 --> 53:22.040
Basically.

53:22.040 --> 53:23.040
I don't know.

53:23.040 --> 53:26.400
I don't know if it's that.

53:26.400 --> 53:33.640
I really don't need my gedit document or my kate document to go between devices, but

53:33.640 --> 53:37.800
I do need my blu-ray rip of bolt to move between devices.

53:37.800 --> 53:39.920
Are you sure you don't want your document between devices?

53:39.920 --> 53:42.600
Well, I probably do, but I never really can see.

53:42.600 --> 53:45.680
All of a sudden you're going to want to, if you're writing your show notes on your desktop,

53:45.680 --> 53:48.680
then you want them to show up on your tablet so you can use it as a teleprompter.

53:48.680 --> 53:49.680
Sure, sure.

53:49.680 --> 53:50.680
Only cloud.

53:50.680 --> 53:51.680
But I never need it on my TV.

53:51.680 --> 53:52.680
No.

53:52.680 --> 53:53.680
Are you sure?

53:53.680 --> 53:54.680
No.

53:54.680 --> 53:55.680
Yeah.

53:55.680 --> 53:56.680
I'll never, you never know.

53:56.680 --> 54:00.560
Maybe I'll be in the studio one day and I'll want notes up on a big TV screen, so actually

54:00.560 --> 54:01.560
I shouldn't say that.

54:01.560 --> 54:02.560
I could see that happening actually.

54:02.560 --> 54:05.240
Well, with Docs you could do like a presentation method.

54:05.240 --> 54:07.080
Are you talking about Google Docs?

54:07.080 --> 54:08.520
No, I'm talking about.

54:08.520 --> 54:12.440
If you wanted to send a doc to a TV, you could do it for like presentation, so like you could

54:12.440 --> 54:13.720
do like PowerPoint or something.

54:13.720 --> 54:14.720
Yeah.

54:14.720 --> 54:15.720
That's true.

54:15.720 --> 54:18.840
Well, I was thinking actually for Chromecast, I tried, so where my Chromecast is right now,

54:18.840 --> 54:22.560
it's plugged into the back of my broadcast machine because I thought it would be a cool

54:22.560 --> 54:27.880
way to send the tab that I'm currently looking at during Linux Unplugged to the Wirecast

54:27.880 --> 54:36.280
machine because right now I have no way of, Wirecast supplies an add-on product called

54:36.280 --> 54:41.000
Desktop Presenter which allows you to capture your screen and transmit it over the network

54:41.000 --> 54:43.840
and it comes into Wirecast as a camera device.

54:43.840 --> 54:46.520
Extremely handy, very nice feature.

54:46.520 --> 54:50.680
Obviously it's Windows and Mac only, doesn't work under Linux, but the Chromecast, if I

54:50.680 --> 54:55.000
had a physical HDMI device plugged into the back of my Wirecast computer and then I had

54:55.000 --> 55:00.240
the Chrome extension installed on my Chrome browser and I could transmit my tab to the

55:00.240 --> 55:05.640
Chromecast, I would then have a way to over the network send the contents of my Linux

55:05.640 --> 55:10.660
Desktop browser session to my Wirecast machine and I thought that would be great, but I couldn't

55:10.660 --> 55:11.660
get it to work.

55:11.660 --> 55:14.320
I don't know why.

55:14.320 --> 55:18.740
So there's potential there, but I think actually a lot of internet producers could find use

55:18.740 --> 55:20.880
for that and we'll see what happens.

55:20.880 --> 55:21.880
All right.

55:21.880 --> 55:27.160
Well, I got an email I wanted to get into before we wrap up for this week's episode

55:27.160 --> 55:31.480
and maybe the Mumble Room will have a few, I don't really have anything for this one,

55:31.480 --> 55:34.560
so I'm going to pitch this to the Mumble Room.

55:34.560 --> 55:38.520
It came in from Jonathan and he says, I really need some help.

55:38.520 --> 55:44.680
I got a comic book collection of around 2,000 issues and I used Comic Collector Live over

55:44.680 --> 55:51.920
at ComicCollectorLive.com or ComicCollectors at ComicCollectors.com software for cataloging

55:51.920 --> 55:55.680
my collection, but I've recently switched full time to Linux.

55:55.680 --> 55:58.720
Of course, good man, as he should, morally so.

55:58.720 --> 56:04.360
I had thought about redoing my database until recently, I found nothing useful for my needs.

56:04.360 --> 56:08.240
I'm willing to spend money if I can get a good program, but I can't find anything.

56:08.240 --> 56:13.320
Please, help a geek out and let me know, is there something in the Linux community for

56:13.320 --> 56:17.520
cataloging comic book or graphic novel collections?

56:17.520 --> 56:20.160
These are not physical books, they're downloaded comics.

56:20.160 --> 56:21.160
Thanks.

56:21.160 --> 56:24.600
So Mumble Room, anybody in here have an app they use to organize their comic collection

56:24.600 --> 56:25.600
on Linux?

56:25.600 --> 56:28.800
I use comics, it's a C-L-A-M-I-X.

56:28.800 --> 56:29.800
Yep.

56:29.800 --> 56:30.800
Yeah, that's a good one.

56:30.800 --> 56:33.840
You can also use Calibra.

56:33.840 --> 56:34.840
Calibra Office?

56:34.840 --> 56:35.840
No, no, no.

56:35.840 --> 56:36.840
It's a collections office.

56:36.840 --> 56:37.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:37.840 --> 56:38.840
Calibra.

56:38.840 --> 56:39.840
Okay.

56:39.840 --> 56:40.840
All right.

56:40.840 --> 56:42.240
So, C-O-M-I-X is the one I'm the most familiar with.

56:42.240 --> 56:43.240
I'm not familiar with Calibra.

56:43.240 --> 56:48.840
If I'm not mistaken, there's an X-D-N-C plug-in to actually view comics, too.

56:48.840 --> 56:49.840
Seriously?

56:49.840 --> 56:50.840
That's awesome.

56:50.840 --> 56:51.840
That is really good.

56:51.840 --> 56:52.840
All right.

56:52.840 --> 56:53.840
What's the other one?

56:53.840 --> 56:54.840
He does it in a slideshow manner.

56:54.840 --> 56:58.840
Somebody link me the other comic, the Calibra one, and I'll put that in the show notes.

56:58.840 --> 57:00.840
It's supposed to be pronounced Calibra, apparently.

57:00.840 --> 57:01.840
Calibra.

57:01.840 --> 57:02.840
Okay.

57:02.840 --> 57:03.840
My bad.

57:03.840 --> 57:04.840
My bad.

57:04.840 --> 57:05.840
It's an e-book.

57:05.840 --> 57:06.840
It's the e-book reader.

57:06.840 --> 57:14.520
The guy who wrote it was an engineer, I think Stanford, and he wrote this as an e-book management

57:14.520 --> 57:16.560
app.

57:16.560 --> 57:21.320
He just happened to get it at the right time when nobody else had written one.

57:21.320 --> 57:24.600
It's the only e-book app that everybody uses.

57:24.600 --> 57:29.340
Many of the e-book reader manufacturers like Kobo and Sony and all that, they recommend

57:29.340 --> 57:37.720
you use that application, and he only takes donations via a link in the app, and people

57:37.720 --> 57:38.720
send him money.

57:38.720 --> 57:39.720
It's extremely good.

57:39.720 --> 57:40.720
It's really, really good.

57:40.720 --> 57:41.720
It's really, really good.

57:41.720 --> 57:42.720
Okay.

57:42.720 --> 57:43.720
It supports comic books.

57:43.720 --> 57:44.720
There's CBZ files and things like that.

57:44.720 --> 57:45.720
CBR files.

57:45.720 --> 57:46.720
I think it supports everything.

57:46.720 --> 57:47.720
Everything you can imagine.

57:47.720 --> 57:50.120
I think it even supports barcode readers, if I'm not mistaken.

57:50.120 --> 57:51.120
It's been a while since I've looked at it.

57:51.120 --> 57:52.120
It does.

57:52.120 --> 57:53.120
Really?

57:53.120 --> 57:54.120
The add-ons are amazing.

57:54.120 --> 57:59.320
Yeah, I have one of those little Wildcats or whatever the hell the little... It's shaped

57:59.320 --> 58:00.320
like a cat.

58:00.320 --> 58:01.320
I can't remember what the hell it was called.

58:01.320 --> 58:02.320
You get them unlocked from eBay.

58:02.320 --> 58:03.320
It's totally spot on.

58:03.320 --> 58:04.320
It's still in interactive development, too.

58:04.320 --> 58:05.320
They just had a release on the 13th.

58:05.320 --> 58:06.320
Yeah.

58:06.320 --> 58:07.320
It's good software.

58:07.320 --> 58:08.320
Well, that's good.

58:08.320 --> 58:09.320
QCat?

58:09.320 --> 58:10.320
Yeah, QCat.

58:10.320 --> 58:11.320
Thank you.

58:11.320 --> 58:12.320
Yes, that's exactly it.

58:12.320 --> 58:13.320
Yeah, I've got one of them around here somewhere.

58:13.320 --> 58:14.320
Got an unlocked one.

58:14.320 --> 58:15.320
I've got like 150 of them.

58:15.320 --> 58:16.320
Yeah, that doesn't everybody.

58:16.320 --> 58:17.320
That's awesome.

58:17.320 --> 58:24.080
Sorry, I also use the Wiki generator.

58:24.080 --> 58:28.080
There's a plug-in available for it where you can quite literally specify an e-book page,

58:28.080 --> 58:32.920
and it will auto-generate you a PDF on that exact page, including references and all links

58:32.920 --> 58:33.920
available.

58:33.920 --> 58:34.920
Very nice.

58:34.920 --> 58:41.200
Peacemaker in the chat room says, also, there is an Android app that works with Cleebray

58:41.200 --> 58:44.960
called Beam, which will kind of look like a Chromecast effect.

58:44.960 --> 58:47.320
It'll beam books from your Android device.

58:47.320 --> 58:48.320
That's pretty cool.

58:48.320 --> 58:49.320
That's interesting.

58:49.320 --> 58:53.560
Now, back in my day, we used cardboard boxes and plastic bags and index cards, and that's

58:53.560 --> 58:54.560
how we actually kept that.

58:54.560 --> 58:57.640
I mean, this is back before computers were a thing, but yeah.

58:57.640 --> 59:02.760
You know, I am more inclined, personally, I would be, actually I am, without question,

59:02.760 --> 59:09.880
I have a much larger digital comic collection than I have, I have like, probably total,

59:09.880 --> 59:13.880
I have a dozen comics, maybe, and they're all Star Trek, I'm going to be honest, they're

59:13.880 --> 59:14.880
all Star Trek.

59:14.880 --> 59:18.080
I sold all my stuff off when I was like 17, 18 for gas money, so.

59:18.080 --> 59:19.080
Right.

59:19.080 --> 59:22.360
Just a quick clarification, that thing for Android that Peacemaker is talking about,

59:22.360 --> 59:23.920
it's called Calibre Companion.

59:23.920 --> 59:24.920
Oh, okay.

59:24.920 --> 59:25.920
Calibre Companion.

59:25.920 --> 59:26.920
And it lets you beam them.

59:26.920 --> 59:30.680
He was using the term beam to kind of talk about what I was called, mine is called.

59:30.680 --> 59:31.680
That's cool.

59:31.680 --> 59:32.680
That's cool.

59:32.680 --> 59:33.680
So, all right.

59:33.680 --> 59:34.680
And that's in the Play Store, I would assume.

59:34.680 --> 59:35.680
Cool.

59:35.680 --> 59:43.560
So, I have amassed a small collection of digital comics myself, and I just kind of go, I just

59:43.560 --> 59:46.400
do it all by the directory structure, which is not very interesting.

59:46.400 --> 59:47.400
Not very.

59:47.400 --> 59:48.400
Yeah.

59:48.400 --> 59:49.400
That works for you, right?

59:49.400 --> 59:52.040
It does work, because I don't have a huge collection, but I could see if you had thousands,

59:52.040 --> 59:53.760
I could see how that could get a little unmanageable.

59:53.760 --> 59:55.720
Oh, yeah.

59:55.720 --> 59:56.720
And they can.

59:56.720 --> 01:00:00.560
My collection was, it filled a room, let's put it that way, but again, I pissed it away

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.600
on girls and gas back in the day.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:07.560
See, what I do right now is I store it in Dropbox, and then I have an app on my Android

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.960
device that, or on the iPad too, I suppose.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.600
I've never tried on the iPad, but it probably works just the same.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:17.920
There's devices that will connect in a Dropbox, and then import all of the CBR files, and

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.200
then do them that way too.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.800
So that's how I've always managed it.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.800
Right.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.920
I've never really been all that motivated to sit on my computer and read something on

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.640
the screen for an extended period of time.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.640
Yeah, I can either.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:29.640
Like that.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.440
I know, we have a Kindle proper, like the old school Kindles.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:36.280
That's definitely, I'll do that any day over the week for overbooks, no question.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.820
But not like on an Android device or something like that, not so much.

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:45.960
One thing I do is I manage all my books in Caliber, and then it lets you beam your books

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:50.640
from Caliber to your Kindle over the internet, because you can set up a Kindle email address.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.240
Well you get one just for having a Kindle.

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.360
And once you set it up in Caliber, you just select the book in your library that you want

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.680
to read, and it sends it directly to your Kindle.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:02.280
If you have 3G, then it doesn't even matter if you're connected to the Wi-Fi, it just

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.280
works all the time.

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.280
Nice.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.280
That's kind of cool.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.280
That is kind of cool.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.120
Okay, thank you for letting me know, because then I could put it on the Kindle, I could

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.800
go sit down on the couch and read it on that e-ink display, which would actually be pretty

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.800
cool.

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.800
All right, Matt.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.120
Well, I think that'll kind of wrap us up.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.000
I just finished a book last night.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.600
I was driving home from watching Thor.

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.560
I don't know if you've noticed the Thor references.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:28.460
Thor 1 or 2?

01:01:28.460 --> 01:01:29.880
It's Thor Dark World.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.880
It just came out.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.880
It's in the theater right now.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.440
I went and saw it with my buddy John last night.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.680
And it was a good movie.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:39.280
And on the way home, I finished an audio book, and I just want to make a pick, because I

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:42.840
know the holidays are coming up, and sometimes people have a little extra time on their hands.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.200
A lot of shows you might listen to are wussing out, and they're taking the holiday off, and

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.240
so you need that content.

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.320
There's a book I want to recommend for you.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.560
It is an Audible book, and I'll put the affiliate link in our show notes.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.800
If you get this, you do support the show.

01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:02.080
It's called Star Trek X The Lost Years, and it is a story of what...sort of a side story

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.480
of McCoy, Spock, and Kirk, and what happens between the end of Star Trek, the original

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.760
series, and Star Trek, the motion picture, the movie.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.760
Oh, nice.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.320
Yeah, a little background, and why Spock decides to take the Kulinar, and if you don't know

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.200
what I'm talking about, then go screw yourself.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.400
But if you know what the Kulinar is, then this is a book you should go listen to.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.520
I follow you completely.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.180
Here's what's awesome.

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:26.880
Narrated by James Duhon, Scotty, and Leonard Nimoy.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:33.680
James Duhon is actually...one of the secret talents that James had is he was really a

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.240
lot of the voiceover talent for the motion...I'm sorry, for the animated series.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.560
Of course, Scotty was an accent.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.440
He was sort of an expert at doing different voices.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:50.920
He reads this book, and it is so engrossing because he assigns each character their own

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:56.980
dialect, their own...I mean, he just owns every single character, and then whenever

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.840
Spock comes into the story, it's voiced by Leonard Nimoy.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.840
So I'll play a sample.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.840
That's cool.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:15.440
That's fantastic and let me know if the next book, that you want me to find some remixes

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:26.440
And the healer who had nursed him for several days left him both signs that he would be dead before sunrise.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:34.440
The relief on the healer's drawn face was evident. She had attended her patient with loathing and terror.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:52.440
For this was Zakhle the Terrible, the greatest of all the Kolonar masters, with a mind so powerful he had twice used it to incinerate his enemies into ashes at his feet.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:55.440
So that's James Duhon right there doing the reading on that.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.440
That's incredible. He was so awesome.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.440
He's really giving it all he's got. It was so good.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.440
And the sample mixer has the music background audio a little higher than it actually is in the book.

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:15.440
And what's cool about what Audible lets you do is you buy the book and if you use our trial and you sign up, if you decide to cancel when you click our link, you still get to keep that book.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.440
And the Android app and the iOS device app are really nice.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:24.440
And if you have multiple Android devices or if you have like an Android device and a Kindle, it will sync position among them.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.440
Oh wow, that's awesome.

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.440
Yeah, so you can pick up where you left off between devices.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.440
It's an abridged version. It's only two hours and 56 minutes.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:42.440
So I wanted to toss this out there because if you have a little extra time over the holiday season and you want essentially something that's like a podcast or something that's the length of Unfilter and the Supporters Show, you could go grab this.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:47.440
It's Star Trek X, the Lost Year Star Trek, I guess the 10, I don't know why they call it that.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.440
Star Trek the Lost Years. I'll have a link in the show notes.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.440
I just finished it last night.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:05:00.440
And it really kind of bridges the gap between what happened from the end of the original series and Star Trek the motion picture and as a fan of Star Trek, obviously, that was pretty cool for me.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:04.440
I know it doesn't apply to all Linux users, but that's your mistake, not mine.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.440
All right, Matt.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.440
Well, that just about wraps up this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.440
Of course, we'll be back here next Tuesday live over at jblive.tv at 2pm Pacific.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:16.440
Go over to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that in your local time.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.440
And don't forget, we want to hear from you.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:24.440
Go over to jupitabroadcasting.com and pop that contact link, choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown and give us your feedback.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.440
You know, Matt?

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.440
Yes?

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:31.440
I was thinking on Sunday, it's the end of the year, it's the last Linux action show of 2013.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:36.440
It's time to look back at our 2013 predictions and make our 2014 predictions.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:38.440
So I think that's what we'll be doing on the big show.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.440
So I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:40.440
See you Sunday.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.440
All right, everyone.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.440
Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:06:00.440
See you right back here next week.
