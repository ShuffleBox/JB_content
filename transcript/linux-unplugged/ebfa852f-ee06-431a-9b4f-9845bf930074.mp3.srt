1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,720
So before we start the show can we talk about this really great project that the pirate Bay co-founder has built

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,360
He says based on the pirate Bay's own number or based on the music industry's own numbers

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,520
He could be costing them ten million dollars a day

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,400
The pirate co-founder Peter Sunday

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,080
I think that's how you say his name has created a device that he believes is costing that music industry ten million dollars a day

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
And it's a pretty sophisticated device

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,640
You see what it does is it makes a hundred copies of a song and then sends those songs to dev know

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,480
Because the whole point of this device is just underscore how ludicrous the RAAA's model is

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,200
To try to generate revenue off of copies of a digital item and also go after people and sue them for copies of a digital

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,800
item eight million copies of the song have been made and

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,280
the machine just

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,800
Constantly deletes them. It's I think built around a Raspberry Pi and it just downloads the tracks and immediately deletes them because it's the downloading

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,920
That the music industry says cost them the dollars and if you base it on their figures for how much each track cost

14
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,520
That's a lot of money. Yeah, it's it's better than just deleting though because it actually copies them to dev know yeah

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, yeah, that is good of the name to copy machine

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,840
Good for them delightfully foreign, but perfect what a nice

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,800
Yeah, so the it's built on using a Raspberry Pi and then has an LCD LCD display and you know some quote-unquote Python code, right?

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
This is Linux unplugged episode

19
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,440
125 for December 29th

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
2015

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Welcome to Linux unplugged

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,360
Officially my last broadcast of 2015. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hey there Wes

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,320
Technically your last broadcast as well. What fun

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,220
Yeah, it is actually kind of it is when you do as many shows as we do it is

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,520
It's like whoa wait a minute. This is the last one. I'm doing for the year. That's that's uh, that's a mind job

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,700
So coming up on today's episode of the unplugged program

27
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,160
We're gonna follow up on solo s

28
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,220
one dot O's

29
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:14,800
Release and then the computer chaos club had a conference and they went some presenters went deep into red star OS

30
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,120
You know North Korea's custom Linux operating system the best operating. Yeah, in fact Wes you were compelled to install in your own V

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,840
I sure was so we got some clips from the conference and an hour-long presentation

32
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,500
I've boiled it down to just a couple of minutes of some interesting things and interesting ways the red star OS

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:39,020
Surveils its users locks them down to just certain parts of the internet and watermarks all of the media files that pass

34
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,180
through the system and has

35
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:49,020
Processes that are unkillable by root is a fascinating look into a way free software has been used to cripple free speech

36
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,680
It's a little disturbing, but it's also technically fascinating

37
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,000
We'll talk about that in today's episode on the unplugged program and then later on in the show

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,480
We're gonna follow up on that Raspberry Pi kit the canoe or the can or whatever

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
We still don't know what it's called

40
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,840
But it is an out-of-the-box turn your Raspberry Pi 2 into a full-fledged computer with a slick keyboard

41
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,840
Nice case speakers a hookup the whole thing. It's really cool plus

42
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,200
We have some interesting follow-up for scale towards the end of the show if we have time left

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,240
But West before all of that there's a little story

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:26,340
We've followed here on the unplugged program for the year and that is the Linux foundations core infrastructure infrastructure project

45
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,360
You've probably heard about that, right? I sure have and there's different people that have stepped up as of as of

46
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,940
As of like things like heart bleed have come out and things like that to support important open source projects, so

47
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:45,180
Our first bit of follow-up this week is a little thick so we better bring in our mama room

48
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,380
We need them to get a full take on this time appropriate greetings virtual lug

49
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,900
Oh hello

50
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,020
apologies if

51
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,020
50% of the hosts this week are dying I

52
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,700
Apparently have like a sinus infection or something that's killing me

53
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,260
So I'm gonna I'm gonna hand this first story over to you guys and see what you think, but did you hear this?

54
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,740
Facebook is apparently pulling out on their commitment of donating

55
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,380
$50,000

56
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,380
to canoe PGP and

57
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,780
And they say they initially announced they would provide $50,000 per year

58
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,700
They have since rescinded since rescinded West

59
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Your initial reaction

60
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,200
Well, that's unfortunate. Yeah, you know I did see on Twitter that there are some people maybe associated with Facebook who are saying that it's a

61
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,860
Miscommunication, so I don't know if it's clear yet, but clearly you know the canoe PG folks are you know think they're not getting the money

62
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,980
And it's kind of the best

63
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,100
Privacy you know it's the best privacy guard open source that we have so good which is my go-to one

64
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:55,380
I'm I'm wondering virtual lug if anybody has any of the scuttlebutt on on this because it seems like a pretty d-bag move from Facebook

65
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,100
But whenever something like this happens you generally figure

66
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,300
There's more to the story

67
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:04,940
But if canoe PG is willing to go publicly in their news updates to shame there must have been some kind of communication

68
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,620
Yeah, so I'm thinking there must have been a back-and-forth before they made this post. There's something interesting happening there

69
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,860
but I who I just don't know and

70
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,440
One of the things this made me one of the things that's made me kind of

71
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:24,720
Zoom out and think about a little bit is what happens when critical infrastructure projects like this sort of get guaranteed funding from somebody and then

72
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
That somebody pulls out

73
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,820
Is that the open sources community to step up because how what is it?

74
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,860
What is what does an open source project do when they've sort of committed to having that fun?

75
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,280
So maybe I think plans yeah, what do we do then do we just cripple an important project?

76
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,660
Do we step up with some sort of funding? What are your thoughts? You?

77
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,300
Know it would be nice to kind of step up

78
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,180
Canoe PG is one of those tough ones that it's it's used a lot, but it's

79
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,900
Kind of a niche product still unfortunately. Yeah. Yeah

80
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,180
I mean it's gonna take a certain technical user to even know what it is so crowdfunding could be hard crowdfunding could be hard

81
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,660
And that's why it was so nice to see I mean

82
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,260
You know they're still getting the sixty thousand a year from the Linux Foundation

83
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,740
Which is great, but the Facebook's contribution would have nearly doubled that yeah

84
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,220
The other thing I don't quite understand is I guess stripe was also going to contribute, but they were gonna contribute along with Facebook

85
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,220
Or something like that, so I'm not sure how this is affected now either

86
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,440
But obviously these companies make a ton of money off of some of this technology

87
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,180
Winby do you have any reactions to this news and overall like funding of open source projects when in ways the community could step up

88
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,940
Well, I've heard it's been a hard winter for Facebook, and you know money's tight

89
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,920
And this is a lot of money, and they simply can't stretch stretch to it right yeah

90
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,780
No, whilst whilst you were just discussing that with Wes

91
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:43,620
I was thinking you know we've obviously got the Linux Foundation who are doing their sponsorship of critical infrastructure projects, but the

92
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,340
GPG

93
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,580
Funding wasn't through that was it these were

94
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,300
Organizations that just chose to sponsor the project directly. I think rather than through through the Linux Foundation

95
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,900
Right the Linux Foundation part of step, but yeah, but perhaps what we need is some

96
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,900
community

97
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:10,020
organization body foundation that people can contribute to directly and then they

98
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:19,700
Support other critical projects that are not encompassed by what the Linux Foundation is doing because obviously a lot of what the Linux Foundation is

99
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
focused on is to

100
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,020
Represent the interests of its members not necessarily you know the

101
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,740
Open source community large that might diverge from the community's interest yeah, yeah exactly yeah

102
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,260
So maybe we need a more community focused grassroots type you know

103
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:46,660
Some kind of proxy organization that you can yeah that you can put your money into and they then you know fund these projects

104
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,900
That's a really interesting idea

105
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,700
So how is that how do you do something like that without some sort of bias or corruption sneaking in eventually?

106
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,420
And you have to have a lot of people to handle that money, which is always a touchy. Yeah

107
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
Well, you'd need some tried and tested

108
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,420
names

109
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:10,280
Behind this you know the immediate name. I think of is you know Karen Sandler. She's got good standing in the open-source community

110
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,780
She's got the legal chops to deal with this. She's also horribly busy, so yeah

111
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,380
I think the conservancy itself is struggling to raise funds right now

112
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:25,220
Yeah, exactly exactly so but you know you'd need you'd need people like that with a proven history

113
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,620
Yeah with a track record, so here's here's where I'm taking this discussion is

114
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,820
This is our last episode of 2015 looking at 2016 and part of me

115
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:42,180
Part of me has I'm a little worried about about this particular problem. I feel like

116
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,380
The problem we've always worried about as Linux grows is starting to happen to us today

117
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,100
And that is when there's enough new users coming in that don't give a crap about the open-source

118
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,460
Ideology about software freedom

119
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:01,380
They don't give a crap about spreading software around the world and making a general technology platform available to all of humanity what they care

120
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,740
About is replacing their Mac or their Windows desktop more than anything else

121
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,160
And so you get people who are coming in who do not value the open-source software, and I look at it

122
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,060
You know there is a vocal aggressive and

123
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,260
Trolling isn't the right way to put it because it's worse than that because it's it's actually

124
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,980
harmful

125
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,500
there is a subset of the last audience who's still attacking us on a daily basis because

126
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:35,360
We tried to switch the Linux action show over to being produced fully under Linux and in doing so we had to reduce the full

127
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,220
video production scale and

128
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,700
We are we still are being attacked daily because of that

129
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,340
They don't care if it uses open source and Linux they just want to be able to see my hair in high definition

130
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,300
Well, we all want that I mean I understand, but it is

131
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,740
You know it is it's interesting to see more and more people come into this community

132
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,820
Some of them are coming in because of Steam some of them coming in because Windows 10 is stealing all of their privacy and backing

133
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,220
Up their encryption keys some of them are coming in because Mac Macs are coming with a single USB port now

134
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,640
There's a lot of reasons why people are coming to Linux and a lot of them are not coming because of open source

135
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,860
Idealism or or free software and so I don't know if we can rely on these people so the software conservancy project

136
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:23,160
Isn't being funded open SSL wasn't properly being funded until the Linux foundation steps up our own shows are being constantly pressured to be

137
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,860
Produced under a software that is not Linux compatible

138
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:33,180
That is not free software because the there is a larger group of people now who just don't give a shit about those things and so

139
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,980
I look at GNU PG which is an absolutely critical project, and I think maybe the problem is most the users couldn't give a crap

140
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,620
Maybe we need some 1990s Linux

141
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,860
Approaches you know something akin to the box sets that you used to buy for

142
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,660
4050 quid which had all the CDs DVDs and manuals in it

143
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,620
Yeah, you know what's some really good documentation. I could see that working

144
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,900
Yeah, but also, you know a percentage of that going back into community

145
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
projects projects that are critical to

146
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:14,400
Those operating systems and the community at large and you know Red Hat a great ambassadors for the open source community

147
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,740
They employ a large number of developers on different open source projects

148
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,580
so for all of the money that you know Red Hat are making they are channeling a lot of

149
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,220
resources back into open source projects

150
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,900
But of course, it's never going to be enough. There's always going to be something like GNU PG. Yeah, it's true

151
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:39,700
Yeah needs that needs some funding and I I don't mean to say that these new users they come over aren't potential users to

152
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,500
Sort of over time train them and sort of teach them

153
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,840
Through blog posts and mediums like podcasts with the values of open source of why it's important that that is free

154
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,780
So that's a possibility that they are potential

155
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:58,940
Converts of the ideology we can teach them our philosophy, but as they come in they're they're sort of the pragmatists at this point

156
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,760
They just want to get their job. Whatever their pragmatists are kits and you think maybe it's a consumerism thing

157
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,540
Yeah, I think so

158
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:13,300
It's the same reason that people go to Abercrombie and Fitch to get a t-shirt or whatever rather than you know

159
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,380
Go to Goodwill

160
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:21,160
Now how do you relate that to desktop Linux I

161
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:28,500
Think that people see the idea of like a Macintosh or Windows box is somehow crafted

162
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,940
Especially for them, even though it's not it's that kind of thing. Hmm. Hmm

163
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,340
I wonder in all of this if we also are suffering a little bit from our

164
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,460
More, you know our stark division between kernel and user space where they're like we have the Linux Foundation

165
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,220
I feel like a lot of you know, we talk a lot about the kernel. We talk a lot about the kernel community

166
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,820
But less so about the wider GNU ecosystem and a lot of you know core utils

167
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,400
We have celebrity projects right and whereas there's a lot of stuff that isn't sexy that you know

168
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,420
Makes let's let's use our wonderful kernel that maybe doesn't get that much attention

169
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,620
It's a good point. And so this sort of brings us to the next story

170
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,100
That's sort of trying to tackle this specially crafted desktop. Give it something nice

171
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:15,460
New version of solace 1.0 is out the big one. Oh is here

172
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,140
We've been covering it all year long on the show

173
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,300
We just recently did our review of the early version and I'm pretty excited about it. I key just joined us

174
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,340
Thanks for coming in the last minute. I think he's here now, right?

175
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,980
Good. I keep welcome to unplugged in that nice timing sir

176
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:36,300
Thank you very much. Yes, so come on. Don't just sit there and be quiet brag about the new release

177
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:41,260
Tell us what's awesome and tell me how the reception's been. I was to be honest with you

178
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,820
We didn't expect it to go the way it's gone. And I don't mean that in a bad way. I really don't so

179
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,900
Apart from the fact that my host is being completely derpy and I can't find out the stats myself

180
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,940
We've had something like 12,000 downloads already. I would imagine I've seen coverage all over the place about the release. I

181
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,700
Mean, I was really surprised to be honest

182
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,980
I mean and on the one hand they shouldn't be surprised because you know, that's kind of why you're doing it

183
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,940
You kind of want to spam it everywhere and get everyone to use it

184
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,180
It actually works though

185
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,420
Yeah

186
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,940
Well, there's a tiny bug and some people can but you know, it's the end of the year we pretend that didn't happen, right?

187
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,940
Yeah

188
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:28,020
So I see a lot of different people posting on g-plus using it a lot of people talking about

189
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,340
What they like about it

190
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:36,300
So anything major change since we reviewed it on the show any other any any adaptations or improvements. Oh

191
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,060
Yeah, basically everything. Yeah

192
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,900
So we completely rewrote budget because to be fair the old one it's now technically two years old and

193
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:54,540
But the old version, I mean it was full of full of bugs and we had work around there since like early GTK version

194
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,300
So we took all that out

195
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,500
Budgie now has multiple panel support at the moment. You can have a top and a bottom panel

196
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,740
But we'll add left and right later on and we got a new notification

197
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:10,960
Center, which is called Raven and so your notifications get archived there at the moment. They're not interactive, but they will become that

198
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,540
You can configure everything there from there. So the old derpy settings dialog is completely gone

199
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,580
It's kind of your one-stop shop now to configure budgie. So it's kind of cool

200
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:27,060
So how has the coverage been release wise I have the blog posts and then stories that have been written up about it been pretty

201
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,660
Accurate on the coverage. I'm sure a lot of people must be talking about built from scratch. How a hit-and-miss. What's that like?

202
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,340
So we won't mention read it

203
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,900
I'm now the Antichrist on reddit. I feel great about it

204
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,420
It's an uplifting feeling sorry to God

205
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,260
better than being a

206
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:53,100
Yeah, I mean most of them have been really really good to be honest with you. Um, there are inaccuracies in some places

207
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,340
But to be fair, I was lazy about updating the site

208
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:01,580
You know, we were supposed to release on the 25th and we managed it the early hours of the 27th

209
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,860
Which is a lot better than our last release dates been three months late

210
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,500
So we did all right there two days, you know, you can you can take that. Yeah, and

211
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,460
some places

212
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,740
It just clearly not doing the research which is gonna happen. So, you know, you take the coverage first over the accuracy

213
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
That's kind of all you can do

214
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,220
But I mean on the whole people have been positive about it. Some people

215
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,460
Focuses on the wrong parts like oh you're using a different package manager. It's like it doesn't matter

216
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,300
You still have software in the desktop can install them. You can run them it. Yeah. Yeah

217
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,740
Yeah, I mean if you've really I felt like saying there is IPM in a repo if you want to install it

218
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,300
I didn't go that far. I'm not gonna subject anybody to that. Come on

219
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:53,740
Well, congratulations and it's been fun to watch the projects arc and I you know

220
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,980
You kind of had hinted there might be a present from Santa

221
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:01,980
It was a little late, but nonetheless it's still really it's still landed in the rough time timeline

222
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,460
So I think I kind of had a bit too much beer. I think and was maybe a little bit late

223
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:12,020
But we made it hangover or not. We got there, you know, very good. Well, congratulations and

224
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,900
so

225
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,500
What wins the next version? Come on now? Come on now, you know once shit. Well, I always shit. Yeah

226
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:27,180
Will be we will be putting out minor releases. Yeah, and the first minor release is going to be in January. Okay, that's pretty soon

227
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,460
Yeah, yeah. Yeah

228
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,220
Very cool guys. Well, congratulations. I think we're all looking forward to seeing this. Yeah, you know a new member of the ecosystem

229
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,600
Yeah, yeah. Well done. I key. Yeah, keep us posted. Thank you very much. It's always fun to see a new one

230
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,940
Oh born exactly

231
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,180
Yeah

232
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:47,300
And you guys have been you guys been doing a great job spreading the word on gplus and all that and the blog

233
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,420
Post looks really good. So yeah, great stuff

234
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,740
All right. Well, then let's take a minute to tell you something else. That's extremely great. That's my friends over digital ocean

235
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Did you know about my friends over digital ocean? Oh

236
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,340
you go check out do yo cuz I got the droplets and

237
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:06,500
You can use our promo code do unplugged to get a $10 credit do unplugged one word lowercase over digital ocean a simple cloud hosting

238
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,260
Provider dedicated giving you the best Linux rig all on SSDs using KVM. Whoo

239
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,500
That's what makes up a droplet because they take super great hardware tier 1 bandwidth

240
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,540
Data centers all over the world and they let you do it all in less than 55 seconds

241
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,300
The pricing plans you get a whole server spun up less than 55 seconds pricing plans start up five dollars a month

242
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,940
Get your 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD cuz

243
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:36,180
One CPU and a terabyte transfer. I'm not even playing Wes a terabyte and you know, we say that we say terabyte of transfer

244
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,580
We say to your one bandwidth, but it it's really there. Yeah, it is a it makes a big difference over the holidays

245
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,180
I wanted to you know, watch some stuff. We weren't with some friends of mine. We weren't in the same location

246
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,680
I wanted to watch a synchronized stream. I spun up a do droplet stalled engine X

247
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,220
Installed the RTMP module nice to send an RTMP stream up there and bam

248
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,300
Yeah, we actually do that pretty often when we're on location. It's great

249
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,180
It's amazing and you know, or I use it all the time. Is it just a proxy?

250
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,220
You know, I don't have a good link to somewhere. Yeah spin up a droplet download it there. Oh, yeah, absolutely

251
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,680
I use that all the time for the rover all the time

252
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,620
There's some and when you use the promo code deal unplugged you get the $10 credit

253
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,620
You can run that $5 rig two months for free

254
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:20,100
Speaking of engine X they have a recent tutorial. I was posted on the 17th how to secure engine X with let's encrypt

255
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,900
Yeah, so your favorite. Yeah, exactly

256
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,820
So if you want to use let's encrypt on a boon to 1404, they've got a really great guide up a digital

257
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,860
I have tons of good guides tons of stuff

258
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,940
So they have one-click deployment of apps like entire stacks of applications in some cases and then for the stuff where they don't just have

259
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,980
A one button they have really good tutorials because they pay people to write these and then they have full-time editors to edit them

260
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:47,620
It's really good stuff and it really takes it's like it takes the best of the arch wiki and brings it to your service provider

261
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,700
But it's even better than it shows how much they care about the community, you know

262
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,380
Like they're not just here to make money. They do obviously and they should yeah

263
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,060
But they really give a lot back and they don't lock these down to be do specific either, right?

264
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,820
She's pretty cool. There's quickly becoming some of the top hits on Google a lot of these questions

265
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,260
Yeah, I think that's probably their strategy and then why you the way you do that is by making really good content

266
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,420
Exactly digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplug to go spin up a rig

267
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:16,060
There's lots of cool stuff you can do with it and a big thank you digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program for all

268
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,060
of 2015

269
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:24,260
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do thanks guys and thanks you guys out there listening for using that promo code do unplug

270
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,700
Cuz well, that's what keeps them coming back

271
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,760
Keep spinning up those droplets and that's how we're able to show up and buy beer for this show. Let's be honest

272
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,940
Digital ocean comm use the promo code d a one plugged. Thanks digital ocean

273
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,140
Okay. So have you heard of North Korea's?

274
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,260
Operating system called red star OS before today had you heard of it before today?

275
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,360
I had but I never used it before today. We talked about a little bit a long time ago

276
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,800
Yeah, you actually used it.

277
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,320
What was that process like?

278
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,760
Actually, it was surprisingly easy.

279
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,840
Did you have to torrent it?

280
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,800
And then, or did they have direct downloads, or like?

281
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,360
Actually, I found there was a direct download

282
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,200
in one of the links,

283
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,480
and actually downloaded very quickly,

284
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,400
faster than some Linux distributions, actually.

285
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,240
Nice.

286
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
It's just an ISO file, loaded it up in a virtual machine,

287
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,360
and it's kind of the, you know,

288
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,240
the similar Ubuntu installer that they've copied over.

289
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,060
Yeah, okay.

290
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,160
But I was able to, even though it was entirely in Korean,

291
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,320
I was able to click through it,

292
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,940
get it installed, and boot it up.

293
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,260
It does have an English mode

294
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,780
if you can find it in the installer.

295
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,880
So it's based on, I believe, Fedora.

296
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,720
But they've taken so much stuff

297
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,280
from so many different operating systems,

298
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,240
it's really kind of remarkable.

299
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,720
It's a science experiment.

300
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,160
There's clearly a lot of engineering work

301
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
that went into it. Yes.

302
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,680
They've built their own quote unquote virus scanner,

303
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,720
which runs all the time,

304
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,480
but it's not actually even a virus scanner,

305
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,340
it's a pattern matching scanner.

306
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,960
So if you put documents on your system

307
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,560
that have certain phrases in them,

308
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,740
it immediately deletes them, instantly.

309
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,580
I gotta try that.

310
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,400
There's a lot of really interesting things

311
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,720
in this operating system.

312
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,600
And so two German researchers, Florian and Nicholas,

313
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,520
I think is how you say his name,

314
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,240
pulled apart the North Korean operating system,

315
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,200
which closely resembles Mac OS X in far as its look.

316
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,080
Very much like an older version of Mac OS X

317
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,860
when the brushed metal thing was really popular.

318
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,560
This was at the Chaos Communications Club in Hamburg.

319
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,000
They say, we found that the features implemented

320
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,840
in Red Star OS were the wet dream

321
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,280
of a surveillance state dictator.

322
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,440
How about that?

323
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,440
So, because it is a traditional Linux OS,

324
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,400
I figured we probably, just as Linux users,

325
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,320
would be kind of curious what's under the hood.

326
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,400
So I grabbed a few clips,

327
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,400
and this first clip tells us what is just the core use,

328
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,480
what's at the core just from a standard

329
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,720
Linux desktop perspective of Red Star.

330
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,540
If you look into the operating system,

331
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,840
it's basically a fully featured general desktop system,

332
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
you might imagine.

333
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,140
It's based on KDE and Fedora, as I already said,

334
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,960
and it tries to mimic the look and feel of Mac OS X.

335
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,440
You have an email client, a calendar, a word processor,

336
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,780
you've got QuickTime and all of that stuff.

337
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,620
You even have a disk encryption utility

338
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,060
that Will Scott has shown last year.

339
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,220
They implemented additional kernel modules,

340
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,020
and they touched a lot of kernel modules, so.

341
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,960
Oh, hi.

342
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,660
The kernel modules is kind of an interesting thing

343
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,500
in particular.

344
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,440
I might circle back to that in a moment.

345
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,160
They went through and dug through a lot of this stuff,

346
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,560
and what you have is you have a whole system

347
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,720
that has a whole series of protected files

348
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,880
that can't be touched,

349
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,360
and some of these protected files are backend daemons,

350
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,120
some of them are other strange things like.

351
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,400
I sure did a PS real quick,

352
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,920
and there's a lot of stuff running on your default install.

353
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,560
Yeah, and some of that stuff you can't stop

354
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,880
because of this protection system,

355
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,520
and there's some stuff that kind of makes sense

356
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,800
like some of these system files you can't change,

357
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,420
and there's other things that are protected,

358
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,360
like a WAV file that are really strange.

359
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,040
Quite interesting is that

360
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,880
when we were looking through all of this stuff,

361
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,160
there was a bunch of files that have a certain protection,

362
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,500
and they seem to be pretty important for the system,

363
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,980
and then there is a WAV file,

364
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,560
an audio WAV file that actually is protected.

365
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,560
It's userLibWarning.wav.

366
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,340
I don't know if we can hear this.

367
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,120
I hope that your ears are not going to explode right now.

368
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,960
I'll just try it.

369
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,440
Ah!

370
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,500
Do you recognize it?

371
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,840
I'll try it again.

372
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,920
Ah!

373
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,140
You hear that?

374
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,240
Can you tell what it is?

375
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,080
Sounds like a pig.

376
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,400
Yeah.

377
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,360
Ah!

378
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,060
Does anybody know what this is?

379
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,780
Pardon me?

380
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,020
A pig, exactly, and where is it coming from?

381
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,560
Does anybody know?

382
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,400
Do you have any guess where this pig noise is coming from?

383
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,440
I have no idea.

384
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,480
I don't think you'd ever guess it.

385
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,320
Anybody in the Mamba Room

386
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,000
have a guess where the pig noise came from?

387
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,520
It's actually kind of funny.

388
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,280
I've watched the videos, so I'm cheating.

389
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,620
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

390
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,460
Well, don't say it.

391
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,280
I'll play it, and then we'll say it.

392
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,560
That's stolen from Kaspersky Antivirus,

393
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,900
because in the older version of Kaspersky Antivirus,

394
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,740
if you find a virus, it actually will play this sound,

395
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,300
and it's exactly the WAV file from Kaspersky.

396
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,120
We verified this by doing checksums, okay?

397
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,320
So we have a copyright violation right here.

398
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,160
Ha ha!

399
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,120
I don't think anybody's going to stop that.

400
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,840
So yeah, it was a pig from Kaspersky Antivirus.

401
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,080
They have reached into every nook and cranny

402
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,920
of the ecosystem.

403
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,080
This desktop even has a QuickTime player.

404
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,080
They call it QuickTime player,

405
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,440
and didn't you say it's like located in slash applications?

406
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,060
Yeah, it looks like an OS X package,

407
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,460
but it's a Linux binary in there.

408
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,160
Yeah, yeah, so back to the virtual log.

409
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,040
Somebody was going to say something

410
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,560
about the pig noise, I think.

411
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,120
Yeah, it sounded a lot like a pig noise from Warcraft 2.

412
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,280
Oh yeah, that too, yeah.

413
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,640
I thought it was going to be like some slam

414
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,760
against American pigs, is what I thought it was,

415
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,040
and maybe it is. Unclean.

416
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,720
The warning comes up when you're doing something

417
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,920
from the West.

418
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,920
So then there's two processes on a Red Star OS installation

419
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,880
that are all about the quote unquote integrity

420
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,120
of the system.

421
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,640
They watch your system, and if you alter certain files,

422
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,240
there's a primary daemon, and then there's a backup daemon,

423
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,720
and they take dramatic action if you alter a specific file.

424
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,280
They're supposed to prevent tampering,

425
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,320
and they called it Security D.

426
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
Security D is kind of interesting

427
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,120
because Security D is also a process

428
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,660
that is known to run on the Mac OS X,

429
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,860
and I think that I'm not a Mac user,

430
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,320
and I think that Mac OS X with Security D

431
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,600
is kind of keeping track of certificates

432
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,560
and stuff like that.

433
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,440
So what they did is they re-implemented Security D for Linux,

434
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,400
and they included various plugins,

435
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,320
and one interesting issue with Security D

436
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,360
is that it comes with a library

437
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,400
that provides a function called Validate OS,

438
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,600
and what this function does is it has a hard-coded list

439
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,600
of files, you can see like our WAV file right here,

440
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,120
you can see configuration files and autostart files

441
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,600
for SCNPRC is the antivirus scanner,

442
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,880
so it checks if these files are untouched,

443
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,280
and if these files have been tampered with,

444
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,160
it initiates a reboot instantly.

445
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,460
So if you touch one of these files,

446
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,720
your machine will reboot instantly.

447
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,140
The same library is also used from KDM,

448
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,520
so during the startup process when KDM is starting,

449
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,920
it is also doing an integrity check,

450
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,880
and if it finds that one of these files

451
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,200
has been tampered with,

452
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,920
it actually immediately issues a reboot,

453
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,880
and the problem is that if you start tampering

454
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,400
with the system, you will end up in reboot loops

455
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,280
all of the time if you're doing your research,

456
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,720
because once KDM is saying reboot the system,

457
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,880
it's going to check it again if it's rebooted

458
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,500
and sees like it's still tampered with

459
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,560
and it's rebooting again and again and again,

460
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,260
and then your system is basically dead.

461
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,100
Super annoying.

462
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:33,920
Wow.

463
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,280
Yeah, and so they kind of went through in the video,

464
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,600
they talk about what you would have to do

465
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,760
to de-weaponize this thing,

466
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,040
and it's like this whole process of peeling an onion,

467
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,440
and then one of the last things is you go clean up KDM

468
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,400
so it stops checking to see if files have been modified too.

469
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,920
And you could see like if you're distributing

470
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,160
an operating system, integrity would be pretty important,

471
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,840
I suppose, of that operating system.

472
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,520
I'm also just imagining a free software advocate

473
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,080
going to a dictator in a country and telling them about

474
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,820
all the great things you can do with free software

475
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,620
and how you can customize it for exactly your use case,

476
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,200
be that spying on your citizens or not.

477
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Yeah, so our next one really kind of fits in perfectly

478
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,200
with that whole spying on your citizens theme.

479
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,800
They, and this is something we covered I think a year ago,

480
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,440
but now we have details on how it works,

481
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,960
and they go into further detail in the video,

482
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
which I have embedded in the show notes.

483
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,240
Media files that you put on Red Star OS get watermarked

484
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,920
with a ID that is generated based on hardware

485
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,080
in your computer, so it is unique to each PC,

486
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,640
and then every PC that media file goes to

487
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,180
gets that PC's identifier appended to it.

488
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,440
So you could actually track it down back to the original PC

489
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
where the media file was created

490
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,640
and each person it was shared with.

491
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,160
But the most interesting thing this service is doing

492
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,480
is it watermarks files.

493
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,080
And now we are going to look deeper

494
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,260
into what this watermarking means.

495
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,160
So actually, as soon as this system will be started,

496
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,640
it reads your hard disk serial and then scrambles it

497
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,000
a little bit, and as soon as you are plugging in,

498
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,080
for example, a USB stick in your system,

499
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,080
then it will trigger a watermarking process

500
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,520
where it takes the serial, takes and hardcodes a death key

501
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,780
from the binary itself, and then encrypts it

502
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,380
and puts it into your file.

503
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,240
When you're converting this hex key

504
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,640
into a decimal representation,

505
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,480
then you see that it's actually two dates.

506
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,320
We actually cannot confirm what those dates mean,

507
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,300
but one of those matches Madonna's birthday.

508
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,140
Madonna's birthday?

509
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,800
There are rumors that some people in North Korea

510
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,800
might really like Madonna, but this is just speculations.

511
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,440
But if you have a better conspiracy theory,

512
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,440
then just let us know.

513
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,540
Because we found some pretty interesting stuff,

514
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,600
but we actually cannot confirm this.

515
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,000
So technically, the watermarks,

516
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,440
they have an ASCII EOF appended,

517
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,420
which is most likely used by the code itself

518
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,480
to parse the files and see if there's already

519
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,400
a watermark in there.

520
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,240
And for JPEG and RV files, for example,

521
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,280
it just appends this watermark to the end of the file.

522
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,880
And when you have a docx, for example,

523
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,120
then it appends it near the header

524
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,600
where a bunch of null bytes,

525
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,680
and then it just puts it in there.

526
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,200
So it's aware of the type of media file it's altering.

527
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,040
See what I mean?

528
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,880
This is a lot of work to make this system.

529
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,200
It really is.

530
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,280
It really is.

531
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,760
So the watermarking itself is like,

532
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,320
as soon as you open a document file with the office,

533
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,440
then it will be watermarked.

534
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,400
And actually, they have code which watermarks files

535
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,920
even if you don't open those files.

536
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,000
But as soon as we saw this, it's pretty buggy.

537
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,160
It doesn't work every time.

538
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,060
But they have code for this implemented.

539
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:42,600
And mostly it works, but sometimes it just fails.

540
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,880
The supported types that we can confirm are docx files,

541
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,560
image files like JPEG and PNG and RV video files.

542
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,880
But the code indicates that there are several more file types

543
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,840
available for watermarking,

544
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,720
but we most likely didn't look into this.

545
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,760
But the most interesting thing here

546
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,000
is that only media files are affected.

547
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,880
So they don't watermark any binaries or something like that.

548
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,960
They're just, they're reducing their surface to files

549
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,800
which could be used to carry information,

550
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,800
which is actually, which could be used to put information

551
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,480
for your free speech purposes.

552
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,840
And actually what we think is that

553
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,480
this is not a security feature,

554
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,720
so they're actually trying to watermark

555
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,120
free speech in general.

556
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,640
So that every time you might have a document file,

557
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,060
an image or a video file,

558
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,720
then they want to know who had this file

559
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,920
and they watermark it so they can track

560
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,480
the origin of the file.

561
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,360
And they show a visualization of a program

562
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,440
they were able to put it into

563
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,640
and generate essentially a social connections graph

564
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,800
of all of the computers that this had visited.

565
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,360
And they say it's entirely possible

566
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,280
that these files would have visited.

567
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,640
They say it's entirely possible that Red Star OS

568
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,560
could send that ID back to some central server

569
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,480
so they would know which machine ID is tied to which IP.

570
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,920
They wouldn't even have to come hunt down the machine,

571
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,760
they'd just know what house it's at.

572
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,840
And they use an internal IP scheme, 10.1.something.

573
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,760
Right, yeah, at least they're using a private subnet,

574
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,600
that's nice.

575
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,420
The whole country.

576
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,260
That's crazy.

577
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,320
The whole country's behind an app.

578
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,560
And the web browser is a Firefox fork

579
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
and it's like a Firefox 3.0 fork,

580
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,400
the one they looked at.

581
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,220
They have a newer version out now

582
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,880
but the researchers didn't get a chance to look at it.

583
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,680
The only SSL root servers it has support for

584
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,520
are North Korean ones.

585
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,360
And it's just set to use all North Korean URLs

586
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,600
and I couldn't even quite get a DHCP provided address

587
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,640
on my network so maybe I'll have to change that

588
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,640
and see if it's in 10 slash eight, maybe it'll work.

589
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,680
Isn't that interesting that it seems like the DHCP client

590
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,480
didn't even fire up when you tried it.

591
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,880
And then they don't let you have root, so.

592
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,160
You know, here's the reality,

593
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:00,160
is you are giving the distro maker root access

594
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,540
when you set up a Linux box.

595
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,480
And anything they do, so like this thing,

596
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,680
it automatically detects when thumb drives are connected,

597
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,200
immediately mounts them, immediately scans all of the files.

598
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,080
I mean it is very aggressive.

599
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,720
Couple of things though that I thought were interesting

600
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,380
that you might jump out at you

601
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,540
as something you might not expect.

602
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,480
IP tables is installed, turned on, and configured by default

603
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,800
to be protected, to protect the machine.

604
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,640
Wow.

605
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,720
There was a couple other things

606
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,840
that I thought was kind of interesting.

607
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,960
Snort, the intrusion detection system,

608
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,880
installed by default, configured

609
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,320
with some really reasonable defaults,

610
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,920
not actually turned on, but just ready to be flipped on,

611
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,720
and you have an IDS on your rig.

612
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,720
They also included a well-known open source

613
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,240
desktop encryption app.

614
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,820
I'm blanking on the name, it's a GTK app,

615
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,520
I believe it starts with a B.

616
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,120
And I'm messing up with Becerra right now.

617
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,120
And it is legitimately a encryption tool

618
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,600
that allows users to encrypt their files on RedStar OS,

619
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,320
and they can't even find a back,

620
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,080
like they don't see any indication there's a back door.

621
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,960
It's a really useful actual application.

622
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,560
Yeah, their summarization was,

623
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,480
even the North Korean government realizes

624
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,040
that forcing back doors into software is futile

625
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,240
and just gonna make you vulnerable,

626
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,560
so they don't even, even North Korea doesn't bother

627
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,880
trying to inject back doors,

628
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,040
which I thought was a little slam at North Korea.

629
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,760
It sounds like maybe, I'm sure they're using it

630
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,320
for their regular citizens, but these kind of things

631
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,120
make it sound like they're probably also gearing it

632
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,240
for their military use, state use.

633
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,080
Definitely, in fact, they said there's very, very few

634
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,160
web-facing North Korean web servers

635
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,040
that are publicly web-facing,

636
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,760
but one that they did find publicly facing

637
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,120
was running RedStar OS.

638
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,200
Wow. Yeah.

639
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,480
So, I guess the most recent version

640
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,880
hasn't been publicly posted,

641
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,280
so there is one version newer that's in North Korea

642
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,580
that's based on newer stuff,

643
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,120
like it's not based on the 2.6 kernel or something like that.

644
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,720
So, Chris, any chance that Noah and Chris

645
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,540
review RedStar OS?

646
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,800
That would be funny.

647
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,720
That would be, oh boy, what an idea, actually.

648
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,080
That would be a good April Fools episode.

649
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,920
It sure would.

650
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,840
Save that one in the bank, that's not bad.

651
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,280
I like that.

652
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,880
So, Aiki, I didn't happen to be implying

653
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,920
that maybe you're not the trustworthy sort,

654
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,760
but it's true, right?

655
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,380
You distro makers, you really have root access to my box.

656
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,320
Yep.

657
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,160
Yeah.

658
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,000
And I don't know, there's a lot of people out there

659
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,160
that may not really think about that

660
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,380
when they're trying these one-off distributions.

661
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,000
Why should I trust a guy like you, Aiki?

662
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,820
What's going on?

663
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,700
Is it just because Josh hangs out with you?

664
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,620
I like Josh.

665
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,200
No, I mean, mostly I've got a really awesome hat

666
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,760
and I do look pretty good in jeans,

667
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,040
so I mean, those stand for my character more than anything.

668
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,960
I agree.

669
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,240
Your logic has convinced me.

670
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,640
The truth is, no matter what operating system you're using,

671
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,240
if you're downloading from a repository

672
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,380
and you're not the maintainer,

673
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,120
then you're inherently trusting someone

674
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,040
with root access, typically, so.

675
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Yeah, and you know, some of the tools they use

676
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,800
to see if their operating system was spying on them,

677
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,200
for example, was they would just really,

678
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,740
like one of the first things that tipped them off,

679
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,200
it's really simple and straightforward,

680
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,240
they put a thumb drive with a text document

681
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,660
in a Red Star OS machine and never opened it,

682
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,020
and when they ejected it and put it back in another machine,

683
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,680
the file size was slightly larger.

684
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,520
And they're like, well, we never even opened the file.

685
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,360
And so then they realized after analyzing it that it was,

686
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,080
so there's just some basic tools they're using

687
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,820
to determine if the system's spying on them.

688
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:25,080
So the nice thing is, is while they were capable

689
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,800
of using free software to do this,

690
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,800
to surveil their public and to sort of monitor speech,

691
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,520
also free tools were used to discover it and reveal it.

692
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,840
So that's sort of the positive side of it, too.

693
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,680
It really is.

694
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,480
Any other thought, oh yeah, Aiki, go ahead.

695
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,480
Yeah, so on the serious side of it,

696
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,520
there's a few things that we can do.

697
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,160
Now, in terms of delivery from us to the users,

698
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,840
I mean, I know the problem is that we could be evil

699
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,800
ourselves, but from us to the users,

700
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,080
every single package has a hash in the index,

701
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,080
and we only use SSL on the repo, so I mean,

702
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,620
that's one part, they know it'll only be us who compromises.

703
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,160
But on the other side of it, we are open source,

704
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,920
and all of our infrastructure is completely transparent.

705
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,340
We've got build instructions out there,

706
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,960
so anyone can take a package from the Solace repo,

707
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,040
they can build it exactly the same way that we do it,

708
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,540
and they can see every individual comment

709
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,040
that went into making an update that they got.

710
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,080
So that would be one thing that would kind of mitigate

711
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,920
the concerns for people.

712
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,820
They can actually see what we're doing in real time.

713
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,680
Yeah, yeah, Red Star's being developed behind closed doors.

714
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,300
That's a pretty big difference, isn't it?

715
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,140
Yeah, good points.

716
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,160
All right, anyone else in the moment room

717
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,460
have any closing thoughts?

718
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,320
Yes, I do on this.

719
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,160
Yeah, yeah.

720
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,240
So not only do the distro makers have root access,

721
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,080
really anybody that makes a RPM or a deb package,

722
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,000
because those things have setup scripts inside them too.

723
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,160
Yeah, they do. Yes, they do.

724
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,860
Yeah, that's one of the reasons why you have folks

725
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,360
that are trying to work on installing applications

726
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,440
inside sandboxes.

727
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,680
That's part of the reason sandboxing brings some security,

728
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,280
not just when the application's running

729
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,840
in case the application has a vulnerability,

730
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,340
but installation time as well.

731
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,040
It's probably something that'll come up in 2016.

732
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,880
I think it will.

733
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,520
Speaking of things that might happen in 2016,

734
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,920
I bet that's one we'll actually see

735
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,320
somebody working a lot more on.

736
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,360
All right, well, I want to follow up on the canoe,

737
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,520
and I also want to talk about scale,

738
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,320
because scale's getting crazy.

739
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,220
I can't believe it.

740
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,600
So before we do that, I'm going to mention Linux Academy.

741
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,840
Talk about something else you could do in 2016.

742
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,160
Bring your skill level up a little bit,

743
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,400
and Linux Academy's the place to go.

744
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,780
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

745
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,460
They've been sponsors of the unplugged program now

746
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,680
for a while, and all of a sudden,

747
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,880
they're also now on those jerks over at Linux Action Show.

748
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,000
I don't know who those guys are,

749
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,560
but Linux Academy is a platform created by Linux

750
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,940
and open source enthusiasts.

751
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,920
In fact, I think it's a pretty brilliant idea,

752
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,420
because I've definitely noticed over the years

753
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:50,240
that you can suss out somebody who's not really

754
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,960
a genuine open source enthusiast or Linux user,

755
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,200
somebody who's more of like getting into it

756
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,020
to make money off of it.

757
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,720
You definitely notice this when you go to the cons.

758
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,880
You really see like there's companies out there

759
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,440
that make money off the open source ecosystem.

760
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,000
And then there's companies out there

761
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,680
that are part of the open source ecosystem.

762
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,240
They work in there, they follow it,

763
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,040
it's their day-to-day stuff, they live and breathe it,

764
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,400
they advocate it.

765
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,280
Those are the kind of people that make really great content

766
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,520
for other people like that.

767
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,240
And that's where Linux Academy stands.

768
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,520
They are crazy passionate about Linux and open source,

769
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,680
and they wanted to do something

770
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,040
to spread the word about Linux,

771
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,880
and to do something in the content space,

772
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,080
and they just happened to figure out

773
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,240
a pretty good revenue model.

774
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,080
Not like I have.

775
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,360
I think they did a better job than I did.

776
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,280
They might be smarter than you.

777
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,160
They might be, they might be.

778
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,320
You can get smart too by going to

779
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,000
linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

780
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,800
Scenario-based labs, almost 2,000 comprehensive

781
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,140
study guides with videos, instructor help on demand,

782
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,840
seven plus distros you choose from.

783
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,320
It automatically adjusts the courseware

784
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,600
and the virtual servers.

785
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,800
Did I mention that instructor help?

786
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,260
Because that's actually a huge deal.

787
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,100
So it's not just like, okay, go punch some buttons,

788
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,400
and then good luck with everything.

789
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,440
It's like, here's some genuinely good content

790
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,840
by people who really care.

791
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,520
Oh, and if you get stuck, instructor help is available.

792
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,120
That's what makes the difference for me,

793
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,280
because I feel like there's a lot of us,

794
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,740
and we kind of feel like, well, we're smart,

795
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,160
we know computers, I should be able to read

796
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,320
the man pages and figure it out,

797
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,640
but sometimes you want to learn stuff,

798
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,480
and you want to learn it quick,

799
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,380
and you want to learn it well,

800
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,120
and they have real experts to help you.

801
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,080
And that is really a competitive advantage

802
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,960
that a lot of online learning services

803
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,160
cannot compete with, and I think what's genuinely great

804
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,200
about that is the specific type of subject material

805
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,060
is even more challenging for most of these places

806
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,840
to deal with, and this is their bread and butter.

807
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,080
And it's the entire technology stack around Linux

808
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,320
and open source, including AWS,

809
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,680
all of the Red Hat certifications

810
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,920
if you want to get out and work in that space,

811
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,240
OpenStack, Ubuntu, your basic Linux stuff,

812
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,480
your advanced Linux stuff, all of it,

813
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,520
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

814
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,440
They've been improving it all throughout 2015,

815
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,200
and they continue to improve.

816
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,520
Check them out and support the show

817
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,920
by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

818
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,320
Thanks, Linux Academy, for the year of support.

819
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,940
Man, you guys rock it, you rock it.

820
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,400
All right, so I want to just take a moment

821
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,720
before we get into all the other stuff.

822
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,120
We'll do the Canoe follow-up here in a second, too,

823
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,120
but another little bit of follow-up

824
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,280
from a discussion we had a couple of weeks ago.

825
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,320
You see this rumor that Mozilla is working on a tablet,

826
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,140
a stick, and a keyboard, oh, and also a router.

827
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:12,980
Oh, boy.

828
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,680
Yeah, Firefox OS is far from dead.

829
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,380
It's not dead yet at all.

830
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,680
They have a tablet that's gonna be just a web browser,

831
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,520
it's total focus on simplicity, called the Firefox Pad.

832
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,880
It's like just a web browser tablet.

833
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,400
Then they're gonna have like a Chromecast thing,

834
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,720
and they're gonna have a Firefox OS router.

835
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,800
And, and a keyboard, which I believe

836
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,880
may have a Raspberry Pi in it.

837
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,920
So it's like a keyboard with a built-in Raspberry Pi

838
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,760
running Firefox OS.

839
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,720
So you could just plug that keyboard

840
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,680
into a screen or whatever and there you go?

841
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,320
Yeah, this is coming from FirefoxCentral.com.

842
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,000
They say this is an exclusive.

843
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,640
So an Apple TV Chromecast competitor, a router,

844
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,480
a keyboard with a built-in Raspberry Pi,

845
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,280
a tablet that does nothing but run a web browser,

846
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,600
no app store, no telephony, automatic updates.

847
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,920
What do you think?

848
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,200
Is this a scary wandering Mozilla,

849
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,880
or is this maybe the thing to double down on?

850
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,080
Well, I think it's already a scary wandering Mozilla,

851
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,920
but I have mixed views.

852
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,120
I feel like some of these are better than others.

853
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,280
I don't know about the tablet.

854
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,320
I think the tablet space is already kind of difficult

855
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,920
and hard to compete in, and people have a lot of tablets.

856
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,640
What if they get like around 99 bucks?

857
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,480
It's just, here's your web browser tablet.

858
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,480
That might be a great tool for kids who don't do a lot,

859
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,440
but they just wanna check Facebook or whatever.

860
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,520
It's just a flesh wound.

861
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,000
The Chromecast competitor and the router,

862
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,040
I'm definitely interested in.

863
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,880
The router is kind of interesting, isn't it, actually?

864
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,720
And you know what?

865
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,360
The Chromecast thing is what I would totally be down for.

866
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,920
Because I love the Chromecast model, but it's so hard

867
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,720
to shoe hone your own media in there,

868
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,880
and it's such a closed ecosystem.

869
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,880
Firefox would present a much more open playground.

870
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,760
I would buy one.

871
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,080
If they shipped a Firefox stick.

872
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,920
Yep, I would buy two.

873
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,720
Yeah, they could charge me probably 60, 80 bucks, maybe.

874
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,040
99 bucks, maybe.

875
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,560
I'd say 50, but you're a big spender, Chris.

876
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,280
No, I'm thinking, I wouldn't.

877
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,480
But I would support Mozilla, I guess.

878
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,320
Yeah, exactly.

879
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,360
I bought a backpack from them and a shirt before

880
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,520
because I wanted to support them.

881
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,800
So I could kind of see maybe spending

882
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,000
a little extra to support the project

883
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,440
if they would let me.

884
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,000
But yeah, 50 bucks would be great.

885
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
25 bucks would be nailin' it.

886
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,840
Yes, it would.

887
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,200
Yeah, all right, NorthRanger.

888
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,140
What are your thoughts on this?

889
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,520
Well, you know, I really appreciate Mozilla

890
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,600
for their efforts to keep the web open.

891
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,240
But it's kind of a funny point in their history

892
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,480
where they didn't succeed in getting embedded

893
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,080
with other software projects that needed a browser.

894
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,680
They kind of defaulted or seeded that market to WebKit.

895
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,680
So are they trying to kind of do one up on WebKit

896
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,800
and say, well, we're not just gonna give you

897
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,680
the browser engine to build your products around.

898
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,880
We're gonna give you whole OS

899
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,920
to build your project around?

900
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,200
I think it's more of a direct-to-consumer thing.

901
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,240
I think it's more of, well, we tried working with LG

902
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,320
and all these other folks.

903
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,520
Now we're gonna just make a few devices and ship them.

904
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,040
I think it feels, I don't know.

905
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,040
So they say it also does include Panasonic TV.

906
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,400
So that's not totally true actually.

907
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,300
But yeah, I wonder if that's true.

908
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,140
I don't think it is that.

909
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,360
I don't think this is, I think this is a new approach.

910
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,760
I think that brings up the larger question too

911
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,220
of how they tie it into the rest of the Firefox experience

912
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,660
or ecosystem or, you know,

913
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,380
if they do have a success with this,

914
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,920
how do they ensure that that helps

915
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,400
the rest of their brand?

916
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,520
I'll tell you, if they had a really good handoff

917
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,400
between the Firefox web browser on the desktop

918
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,880
or your mobile and the Firefox web browser tablet.

919
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,480
So if this thing's 99 bucks, let's say.

920
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,960
And let's say it's got like a 10-inch

921
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,080
or larger widescreen display.

922
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,520
And it's got maybe an all-day battery.

923
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,980
And this thing is a touch of a button

924
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,360
and your web browser's ready to go

925
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,360
and everything you were just looking at on your desktop

926
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,400
is now available on your tablet or vice versa.

927
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,800
You could go from tablet to desktop.

928
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,800
If they nailed that using Firefox or Mozilla Sync, whatever,

929
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,920
and this thing's running Firefox OS,

930
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,400
I think there's some people in this audience right now

931
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,400
that go, well, you know what, I don't need the iPad.

932
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,820
I don't need the Android tablets

933
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,920
that constantly disappoint me

934
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,080
because number one thing I do on that Android tablet,

935
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,400
I run Chrome.

936
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,240
And so I'm not speaking for me.

937
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,880
I'm just saying this sounds like somebody,

938
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,280
this sounds like a likely scenario.

939
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,420
And if the number one thing you're using your browser for,

940
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,420
your tablet for right now is Chrome or Safari,

941
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,520
well, maybe this works really well for you,

942
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,680
especially if you're already a Firefox user.

943
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,800
They gotta do something because I keep seeing stories

944
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,240
about how Firefox's browser share

945
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,360
has been shrinking for years now.

946
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,080
And I don't wanna live in a world without Mozilla.

947
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,120
I don't think I'm ready for that.

948
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,920
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

949
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,380
Anybody else, WWE, do you have any thoughts?

950
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,380
Anybody else have thoughts before we wrap up?

951
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:49,040
I'm thinking that maybe they learned something crucial

952
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,840
from the Firefox OS phone

953
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,500
and maybe they figured out, okay,

954
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:59,500
maybe we should go desktop and get more users

955
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,140
but make it so it could be mobile

956
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,560
so people could take it with them somewhere else

957
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,000
and use someone else's keyboard and mouse or whatever.

958
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,880
Maybe they're trying something different

959
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,560
that will work out for them in the long run, I hope.

960
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,080
Well, this is what I find interesting.

961
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,680
Maybe out of all of this is the Firefox Pie.

962
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,640
And if you would have talked to me a couple of weeks ago,

963
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,720
I would have found this to be maybe the least interesting.

964
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,880
But now since we've talked to Wimpy and he says,

965
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,960
the version of Ubuntu Mate for Raspberry Pi is super popular.

966
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,720
We got this canoe in that it makes the Raspberry Pi

967
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,800
like a ready to go computer kit

968
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,540
that really just means you don't plug a few things together

969
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,560
like building Legos and you have a full computer.

970
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,800
I look at this Firefox Pie and the bullet points are,

971
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,400
the target market is education and emerging markets.

972
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,560
Education is brilliant.

973
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,880
For creation, not just consumption of the web.

974
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,660
Keyboard, computer form factor

975
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,400
with built-in keyboard and trackpad.

976
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,840
Can plug into spare TV or monitor.

977
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,000
E.g. millions of obsolete analog TVs in India.

978
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,840
Mozilla web maker built-in.

979
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,580
Harnesses the maker movement, which is a funny bullet point.

980
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,420
Yes, it is.

981
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,800
And partnership with Raspberry Foundation

982
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,280
and or the canoe?

983
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,120
Question mark.

984
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,440
Question mark.

985
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,040
So let's shift over and talk about that first.

986
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,280
Oh, I don't have my webcam working.

987
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,100
That's too bad.

988
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,840
I don't have, oh, hello, hello.

989
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,680
So anyways, right here in studio, we have the canoe,

990
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,580
which we talked about on the episode

991
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,360
right before the holidays of Linux Unplugged.

992
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,600
It is a very cool piece of kit

993
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,360
that makes the Raspberry Pi a ready to go computer

994
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,440
and listener FilesCopied said this

995
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,240
because he thought this might pique my interest.

996
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,600
FilesCopied, how did you hear about the canoe

997
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,080
and what made you decide to send it in?

998
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,760
Oh, the main way I found it,

999
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,680
I had a friend that was trying to get someone interested

1000
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,480
in learning about computers

1001
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,400
and all the toys that she was looking at,

1002
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,920
I was like, they're just toys.

1003
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,800
I wanted to find like a real Linux kit.

1004
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,300
I knew something had to exist.

1005
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,600
And so you started your search and you came across this

1006
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,400
and it's an actual ready shipping to go product.

1007
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,680
And so you sent it into the studio,

1008
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,520
you sent us a heads up,

1009
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,480
but I got the box like the day we went on air

1010
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,000
and the email I didn't read till like the day

1011
00:47:59,000 --> 00:47:59,840
after we went on air.

1012
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,240
I didn't know who sent it in, so it was great.

1013
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,960
We tracked him down, we got FilesCopied here.

1014
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,040
I played with it a little bit

1015
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,000
and my impressions were this is really slick.

1016
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,240
It's still more work though than the Firefox Pi,

1017
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,240
but what it made me realize is this is ready for my kids.

1018
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,880
The Raspberry Pi, once you get this,

1019
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,040
like they could assemble this,

1020
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:20,000
my six-year-old I think could put this together

1021
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,840
and he would have a Linux Raspberry Pi

1022
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,840
and the idea of the Firefox Pi is like maybe the solution

1023
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,800
for Chromebooks in education, possibly.

1024
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,520
You know, you get something that's ready to go,

1025
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,800
20, 30 bucks with a keyboard and everything,

1026
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,360
that could be pretty portable.

1027
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,520
Yeah, we'll see.

1028
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,140
I mean, there's still a lot of other factors

1029
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,280
like marketing and deals and all that kind of stuff

1030
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,120
to make something like that,

1031
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:50,120
but I don't know if I like the idea

1032
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,280
of the Mozilla Foundation being people behind it,

1033
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,680
but I still want to see where it goes.

1034
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,000
Right, and I wonder how much Mozilla can manage

1035
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,640
a transformation, because I just think

1036
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,480
about the days before Chrome existed

1037
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,840
and I remember being a little surprised

1038
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,880
how Google's making web browsers.

1039
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,140
I mean, it made sense given their agenda,

1040
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,560
but they've managed to kind of transform themselves

1041
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,400
from what they were into owning Android and Chrome

1042
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,560
and so much and I wonder if there's any chance Mozilla can,

1043
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,680
maybe there's a future where Mozilla makes a great router

1044
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,440
and I trust them with my internet infrastructure.

1045
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,440
That would be really great.

1046
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,480
And you want a cheap computer that doesn't have

1047
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,760
like an advertising monster behind it.

1048
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,000
And it's a first class web client.

1049
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And it comes with web creation software.

1050
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,840
Right.

1051
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,600
Mumble, have any closing thoughts?

1052
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,560
Go on, once. I do.

1053
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,960
Yeah, go ahead.

1054
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,560
I think they're spreading themselves too thin.

1055
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,180
That's my concern, too.

1056
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,880
You think that's a valid concern?

1057
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,280
Yeah, it's just like the most recent upgrade

1058
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,760
to the Mozilla browser, for whatever reason,

1059
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,720
just decided to not work with Google.

1060
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,640
Is that their fault though or is that Google's fault?

1061
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,560
I don't know.

1062
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:03,400
Yeah.

1063
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,360
I know that like I'll be on Google Plus

1064
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,640
or YouTube or whatever and either the page won't load

1065
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,140
or the page will just stop loading.

1066
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,580
And then I'll close the browser, open it back up.

1067
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,300
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

1068
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,280
Don't know what's going on there.

1069
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:23,280
Yeah, I hope, so here's my, I'm very conflicted.

1070
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,220
And I hope people aren't getting tired of this

1071
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,360
because I'm actually, my stance on this is starting to change

1072
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,140
as we do these episodes.

1073
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,740
I initially would have taken the hard line.

1074
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,000
They need to focus on the browser

1075
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,400
and focus on Thunderbird even.

1076
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,240
Right.

1077
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,200
But now, when you look at the undeniable trend,

1078
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,440
I think it's, Wes, I don't know if you remember the number.

1079
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,760
I think definitely 2011,

1080
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,300
but I think maybe even possibly since 2009,

1081
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,320
Firefox browser market share has been on a decline.

1082
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,320
Yeah.

1083
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,680
And that's the reality of the market.

1084
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,360
And the thing is, is what's pushing that too

1085
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,400
is also mobile to a degree

1086
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,400
which they have very little foothold in.

1087
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,020
And so they are just literally now dealing

1088
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,380
with a new market reality.

1089
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,320
And they have to make some adjustments at some point

1090
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:04,000
to stay a viable company.

1091
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,400
Not that they're about to die and go away,

1092
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,120
but you need to get ahead of the puck.

1093
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,480
You gotta have the momentum to keep going.

1094
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,120
Exactly, and you gotta start early

1095
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:13,240
in some of these new emerging marketplaces

1096
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,360
and in a lot of things, done right,

1097
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,240
there is demand for that

1098
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,280
because right now these things

1099
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,520
like these Internet of Things devices are just a mess

1100
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:21,880
and they're a hot mess at that.

1101
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,520
So if you could have a trusted name

1102
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,240
that has a trusted brand come in and offer some devices,

1103
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,080
they could have a foothold.

1104
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,500
And I wonder if they can play up the foundation aspect.

1105
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,840
I'm sure there are competitors to Google

1106
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,520
that are worried about having too much investment

1107
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:35,840
in this other company.

1108
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,680
Mozilla might be a more neutral party

1109
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,280
where you can be like, well, we use their stuff

1110
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,920
because they don't have an agenda against this.

1111
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,120
Or even if they just shipped a couple of these things

1112
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,240
and they were good.

1113
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,560
Let's just say they shipped the Stick and the Raspberry Pi

1114
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,000
because that Firefox Pi just,

1115
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,800
Raspberry Pi is just complicated.

1116
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:52,640
It's like you could make that today.

1117
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,500
Yeah, and the Raspberry Pi is being built for you.

1118
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,280
If they could ship those

1119
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,520
and they were really well received,

1120
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,000
then maybe your Panasonic's and your LG's

1121
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,200
would be willing to sort of have a more serious conversation

1122
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,280
about shipping a good product.

1123
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,120
A proven record.

1124
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,760
Yeah, but we'll see.

1125
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,880
We'll see where it goes with that.

1126
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,760
All right, so I got a little more to cover.

1127
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,280
We've got some big stuff coming up in just,

1128
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,920
well, January, which is just around the corner.

1129
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,760
Like literally around the corner.

1130
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:19,600
Sure is.

1131
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,420
Holy smokes, Wes.

1132
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,260
Holy smokes.

1133
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,100
What are you doing in January?

1134
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,360
Got anything big coming up in January, Wes?

1135
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,200
No, I don't.

1136
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,360
But I think that means that I have some exciting projects

1137
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,200
I need to finish.

1138
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,360
Well, well, we got some exciting stuff

1139
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,260
coming up in January.

1140
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,240
So you will be probably involved in some way or another

1141
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,140
with some of these shenanigans.

1142
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:35,980
I hope so.

1143
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:36,840
Yeah, yeah.

1144
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,920
And I'll tell you about that.

1145
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,240
But first, I'm gonna tell you about our friends over at Ting.

1146
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,280
You know, I was talking to Kyra over the holidays,

1147
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,500
as I do.

1148
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,400
Well, you guys are besties.

1149
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,240
Yeah.

1150
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,760
Well, she's an Overcast fan.

1151
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,040
And I was, so I called her and I said,

1152
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,800
Kyra, I noticed you had some podcasts

1153
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,760
and your Overcast subscription,

1154
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,920
but I didn't see Linux Action Show,

1155
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,240
didn't see Linux Unplugged, so I had to talk to her

1156
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,080
about that.

1157
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,920
You know, I squared her away.

1158
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,920
Just a little, you know, slap on the wrist.

1159
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,320
Don't worry, don't worry, it's not a big deal.

1160
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,120
But you know what, Kyra works over at Ting,

1161
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:00,960
and I love Ting.

1162
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,920
Let me tell you about Ting.

1163
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,680
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

1164
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,040
It's a flat rate, it's really simple.

1165
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:08,640
Six dollars for the phone every month.

1166
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,720
That's all you pay.

1167
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,320
And then it's just your usage on top of that.

1168
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,480
So if you don't use a line, then you don't pay anything.

1169
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,760
And if you use a little more data one month,

1170
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,080
or a couple of months,

1171
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,600
then the other 10 or 11 months of the year,

1172
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,780
you'll use less and you pay way less.

1173
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,000
So it sort of adapts to your actual usage.

1174
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,040
So for me, that usually means in April I have a spike,

1175
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,980
and around the holidays I sometimes have a spike.

1176
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,180
But for the majority of the year,

1177
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:34,160
my cell bill for three lines is around 40 bucks.

1178
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,280
That's amazing.

1179
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,120
Hard to beat.

1180
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:36,960
That is really hard to beat.

1181
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,600
And the thing I love about Ting is they have

1182
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,360
two networks to choose from.

1183
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,920
So you can just be a little savvy.

1184
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,120
They got the GSM and CDMA networks.

1185
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,320
So if you have a phone that's compatible

1186
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,720
with one of those networks,

1187
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,080
you can get a $25 service credit

1188
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,380
by going to linux.ting.com.

1189
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,480
You also support the show.

1190
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,080
And if you don't have a Ting device yet,

1191
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,080
you can get $25 off a device by going to linux.ting.com.

1192
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,780
Unlocked devices, great devices.

1193
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:03,160
I love that they now have the brand new Nexus 6P

1194
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,280
and the Nexus 6, the first Nexus 6,

1195
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,300
because check this out.

1196
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,720
Now it's $350.

1197
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,520
Boy, that is like half off.

1198
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,300
Yeah, on Ting, unlocked, direct updates from Google,

1199
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,040
Android M, pay for what you use, right?

1200
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,840
And then they also, if you want a great value Android phone,

1201
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,840
the LG Volt 2, lollipop 5.1, tri-band LTE,

1202
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,560
five inch display, $183, no contract,

1203
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,220
unlocked, pay for what you use.

1204
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,920
That's crazy.

1205
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,740
Ting!

1206
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,240
Linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com, go check them out.

1207
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,140
Also, they have an early termination relief program.

1208
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,480
If you got stuck in one of those duopoly contracts,

1209
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,280
you can find out more about that on their website.

1210
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,400
Just get started by going to linux.ting.com.

1211
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,520
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring

1212
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,620
the Unplugged program.

1213
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,500
Thank you Ting, thank you Ting, thank you very much.

1214
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,040
Okay, Wes, so it was like last week or two

1215
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,360
I got talked into trying to go to scale this year.

1216
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,200
You just couldn't resist.

1217
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,880
Frickin' scale 14, January 21st through the 24th

1218
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,440
in Pasadena Convention Center.

1219
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,960
And Mr. P4, P3R, in the Linux Action Show subreddit

1220
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,120
started a semi-official scale 14 thread.

1221
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,680
And if you're going, I invite you to check out this thread

1222
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,600
and give us the details.

1223
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,440
So is it official now?

1224
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,360
Does that make it official?

1225
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,840
Well, we're workin' on it.

1226
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,080
So, you know, budget-wise it's extremely tight

1227
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,720
because in April Linux Fest Northwest is a big deal for us

1228
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,640
and that's where we spend pretty much all the money

1229
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,480
we make in a year.

1230
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,720
That's a first class production.

1231
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,900
Yeah, so this being in January is super tight,

1232
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:33,180
but we're, and oh, oh, oh, oh, and to make matters worse,

1233
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,080
right during Noah's wife's birthday.

1234
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,920
Ooh.

1235
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1236
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,860
But we really, it seems like it's becoming

1237
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:39,840
a pretty big event.

1238
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,940
And so we're gonna try to make it down there,

1239
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,780
one way or another.

1240
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:43,640
I don't know yet.

1241
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,760
Still trying to work out the details

1242
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,320
on how I'm gonna do that.

1243
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,520
But I'm trying to get a sense of how big the audience

1244
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,440
is gonna be, presence-wise, down there.

1245
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,020
And so that thread's there.

1246
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,860
And we might move that into a meetup thread at some time

1247
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:55,760
if we get a lot of interest.

1248
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,720
So I'll have it linked in the show notes.

1249
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,900
I should probably put it in the chatroom, too.

1250
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,160
Wes, do you mind dropping that in the chatroom

1251
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,000
when you get a chance?

1252
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,820
I would be happy to.

1253
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:04,660
Thank you, sir.

1254
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,580
Is anybody in the Mamba Room going to scale?

1255
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,220
Nobody?

1256
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,520
I know Poby's gonna go, but he's not here today.

1257
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,560
I'm wondering, I'm curious to see,

1258
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,080
because we don't, for a bit we were considering not going,

1259
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,040
just because of the cost,

1260
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,400
because we go to so many other shows.

1261
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,000
But I think it's a big enough event,

1262
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,180
and with UbiKon happening a little bit beforehand.

1263
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:28,560
So we have the official scale thread started.

1264
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,660
It's over there.

1265
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:30,500
You can go check that out.

1266
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,680
Go show your support.

1267
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,520
See if you'll be there.

1268
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,360
Sure.

1269
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,640
Make it a good event.

1270
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,480
Sure.

1271
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,400
So a couple other things that I want to talk about,

1272
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,440
just sort of, now it's just towards the end of the show.

1273
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,920
I got the fire going.

1274
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,760
It's just you.

1275
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,220
So warm and cozy.

1276
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,540
You, the Mamba Room,

1277
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,800
couple hundred of our closest friends listening now.

1278
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,080
I'm sure most people downloading

1279
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,520
probably are gonna tune out here in a couple of minutes.

1280
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,380
So I'm just gonna have a little chit chat with you guys.

1281
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,280
A little fireside chat.

1282
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,540
So we're gonna make some changes

1283
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,720
on the Linux Action Show coming up pretty soon.

1284
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,540
Whoa.

1285
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,380
Yeah.

1286
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,220
And we're gonna tell you about it

1287
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,080
on Sunday's Linux Action Show.

1288
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,440
We're doing the Linux Action Show on Sunday this week,

1289
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,000
because of New Year's.

1290
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,780
So that will be on January 3rd.

1291
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,680
And I invite you to tune in.

1292
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,640
I'm excited already.

1293
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,960
We can talk about that kind of stuff.

1294
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,100
Get your feedback live in the chat room.

1295
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,880
And we're gonna make that pretty integral

1296
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,040
with the show experience.

1297
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,520
So I'd love to have you there live, if you can,

1298
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,360
on January 3rd.

1299
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,680
We're gonna do it at 10 a.m. Pacific time.

1300
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,720
You can go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

1301
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,760
slash calendar.

1302
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,580
But I'll just give you a hint.

1303
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,420
Just give you a hint.

1304
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,680
You're gonna be seeing a lot more of us.

1305
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,520
That's all I'm gonna say.

1306
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,360
I'm just gonna say that.

1307
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,180
Oh.

1308
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,020
I don't want you to take that for what it is.

1309
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:37,860
Mystery.

1310
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,680
Yeah, yeah.

1311
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,520
So there you go.

1312
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,360
Wes, I hope you have a good New Year's.

1313
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,200
Oh, I sure will.

1314
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,020
Yeah?

1315
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:42,860
You got any big plans?

1316
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,160
I'm thinking about seeing some friends in Portland.

1317
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,000
Really?

1318
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,820
Yeah.

1319
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:47,660
That's a good, that'll be a good drive.

1320
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,500
A little New Year's road trip.

1321
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,320
Yeah.

1322
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,160
Yeah.

1323
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,000
It's gonna be like a fun time.

1324
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,820
So I'm thinking, going back to scale real quick,

1325
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,360
I'm thinking while I'm at scale,

1326
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,540
depending on, so here's the thing.

1327
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,220
It goes from the 21st to the 24th, right?

1328
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,060
In January.

1329
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:58,880
Okay.

1330
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,800
And UbiCon's like on the 20th or something like that.

1331
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,360
I would love to take the rover down.

1332
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,800
I just don't know how it works out timing-wise

1333
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,960
because I got so much going on in the month of January.

1334
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,000
I got family stuff, I got my daughter's birthday,

1335
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,400
I got my birthday, I also got some business stuff

1336
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,240
going on.

1337
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,060
Oh, it's your birthday.

1338
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:15,900
That's good to know.

1339
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,120
And it scales right in the middle of all of it.

1340
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,400
So it's just really crazy.

1341
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,520
But if I go down there,

1342
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,800
I would probably be doing Linux Unplugged from the road.

1343
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,360
So it'd be one of those where you could be in studio.

1344
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,200
Hey, hey, hey.

1345
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,040
I like, those are fun.

1346
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,120
Those are fun.

1347
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,400
Yeah.

1348
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,960
And then Kernel Linux will be making out there midweek

1349
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,640
and we'll probably record a Linux action show from there too.

1350
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,240
Maybe, maybe not, depending on the timing.

1351
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,800
Now looking at the calendar, we actually might not.

1352
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,480
So yeah, we're not gonna do a booth.

1353
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,300
Okay, so you'll be free floating.

1354
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,600
Yeah, oh man, that's my favorite.

1355
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,400
I don't know, we might not ever do a booth again

1356
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,080
except for at Linux Fest Northwest.

1357
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:49,960
Yeah.

1358
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,800
It is-

1359
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,640
Well, you're a staple there.

1360
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,640
I mean, you have to.

1361
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:55,320
Well, and it's fun to do the two-day broadcast.

1362
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,520
I suppose that would be sort of the line

1363
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,560
is if we're gonna do a multi-day broadcast,

1364
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,680
then you kind of have to have a booth.

1365
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,380
But if you're going there to get clips and do interviews,

1366
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,120
it's all much better to be walking around.

1367
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,320
Right, you get the real experience

1368
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,920
of what someone else at the conference would be.

1369
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,160
Yeah, yeah.

1370
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,200
All right, so anyways, join that.

1371
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,440
We'll have that thread over there.

1372
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,440
And I hope you guys, if you're gonna make it,

1373
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,000
can leave a comment in there.

1374
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,600
And I also hope you have a great holiday.

1375
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,760
Happy New Year's to everybody in the bubble room.

1376
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,320
As we wrap up here, does anybody have

1377
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,460
one big prediction for Linux in 2016?

1378
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,120
Anybody have one they wanna, if you do,

1379
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,020
ping me in the IRC with the mum prefix.

1380
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,660
Do you have any big predictions for 2016, Wes?

1381
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,680
You have anything you've been kicking around?

1382
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,840
Big predictions.

1383
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,160
Yeah, I know, it's hard when you actually go to get it,

1384
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,720
when you actually go to just do it on the spot.

1385
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,560
It's one of those, like,

1386
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,440
and they come to me while I'm driving around,

1387
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,240
and I'm like, oh, that's totally gonna happen.

1388
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,680
And I write it down.

1389
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:52,460
I think Ubuntu 16.04 is gonna be a powerful release.

1390
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,680
I think that's gonna be one of the releases

1391
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,760
that shapes the Linux ecosystem for the next,

1392
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,000
you know, three or four years.

1393
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,460
It looks like Wimpy and the gang did theirs

1394
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,120
in Ubuntu podcast season eight, episode 42.

1395
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:03,860
We did.

1396
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:04,700
So I'll have to have a listen.

1397
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,880
I will, I will, I'll have to have a listen.

1398
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,240
And then Ham Radio, you have a big prediction for 2016.

1399
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,640
He says that you're the Linux desktop.

1400
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,580
I thought he was in the moment room.

1401
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:21,220
But yeah, oh, well, look at Ikey dropping some,

1402
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:22,560
look at that, wow, look at that.

1403
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,680
He's trying to get, he has a,

1404
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,640
Ikey, you have a challenge with Mark Shuttleworth?

1405
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:26,480
Now we've completely gone off rails.

1406
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,440
Let's hear it, let's hear it.

1407
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,500
This'll be a good ending note.

1408
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,320
You saw it on G+, right?

1409
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,160
No, I don't think I did see it.

1410
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,200
You can drop us a link, though.

1411
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, did you do a throw down publicly with,

1412
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,140
because I'm sure he'll respond, because, you know.

1413
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:41,480
Well, I mean, it was more in humor,

1414
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,360
but the way it started out is somebody was saying

1415
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,920
about 32-bit UEFI and all that crap.

1416
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,760
And I was like, okay, I'll try and get it working.

1417
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,480
So I went down to the shop and got a tablet

1418
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,880
and it had Windows 10 on it.

1419
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,560
No, it didn't, it had Windows 8.

1420
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,000
Jesus, it's bad.

1421
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,640
Like, I don't know how you're supposed to do it.

1422
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,160
Like, you'd need a seal to coordinate your actions

1423
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,760
for you to use the screen.

1424
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,840
So I had to think about it and I thought within five minutes,

1425
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,720
well, GNOME can already do half the things

1426
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,240
you need to do on a tablet.

1427
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,160
So after I'd bitched about it publicly,

1428
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,960
I put a comment there underneath,

1429
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,920
and I said, well, during 2016,

1430
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,920
we'll get to the end of 2016

1431
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,880
and see who's got a better tablet-based operating system,

1432
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,540
Solus or Ubuntu, and I didn't get a reply.

1433
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,000
So, I mean, it was friendly,

1434
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,840
but yeah, the challenge is still there.

1435
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:31,240
All right, so maybe we'll see a tablet out of there.

1436
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,480
If you guys have any other predictions,

1437
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,240
if you think about it, we could cover them in the post-show,

1438
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,800
but otherwise, that's one of the things

1439
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,560
we will be doing on Sunday's Linux Action Show.

1440
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,800
Wow, look at me bring it all back.

1441
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,200
On Sunday's Linux Action Show,

1442
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,600
we're gonna do our 2016 predictions,

1443
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,600
an annual tradition, an annual tradition,

1444
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,040
which means at some point,

1445
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,760
we have to own up to past predictions,

1446
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,600
which I guess would probably be with Matt,

1447
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,820
I can't remember, which I haven't contacted him about,

1448
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,800
so I'm not sure.

1449
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,320
So we might just have to start fresh,

1450
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,400
because I can't really hold Matt accountable

1451
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,720
if he's not there to attest.

1452
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:02,680
But I wonder how I did.

1453
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:03,520
I'll have to go back,

1454
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,800
because that's always the hard thing,

1455
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:05,800
is go back and see how I did.

1456
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,000
And you know what always really stings,

1457
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,280
is when I go back and look at the predictions

1458
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,880
that didn't come true, but totally should have, right?

1459
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,280
Those are the ones that. Then you just get sad.

1460
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,680
Yeah, like why did that happen?

1461
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,840
Why did that happen?

1462
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,880
All right, well that brings us to the end

1463
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,840
of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1464
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,840
Thank you very much for tuning in.

1465
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,640
Hope you will have a fantastic New Year's.

1466
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,040
Hope you had a great holiday.

1467
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,840
Make sure to join us for all the Linux excitement in 2016.

1468
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,760
No kidding.

1469
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:27,960
Kick it off.

1470
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,520
Keep it at broadcast.com slash calendar

1471
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,800
to get it converted to your local time zone

1472
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,080
over at jblive.tv.

1473
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:34,460
Don't forget we've got that mumble room,

1474
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,960
which you are welcome to hang out in our virtual mug.

1475
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,280
Linux Action Show on our reddit.com

1476
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,080
is where you go to submit topics or feedback

1477
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,520
for episode 125.

1478
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:45,200
You can also go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact

1479
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,680
and choose Unplugged from the dropdown.

1480
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,360
And yes, I know I sound like I'm sick.

1481
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,200
So don't have to write that in.

1482
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,160
I'm probably gonna get like a dozen of those.

1483
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:50,980
I don't want that.

1484
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:51,820
I know that.

1485
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:52,660
All right.

1486
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,040
Thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode

1487
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,160
of Linux Unplugged.

1488
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,720
Hope you had a great 2015.

1489
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,560
See you in 2016.

1490
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:14,560
Okay.

1491
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:50,360
All right.

1492
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,360
There we go.

1493
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,720
That is the last show of mine in 2015.

1494
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:54,720
My last show.

1495
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,720
Boom!

1496
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,720
Done right there.

1497
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,960
I want to give Wimpy some credit for his excellent suggestion of a hot toddy right about now.

1498
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:01,200
I know, right?

1499
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,200
What is it?

1500
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,200
So it's Bailey's?

1501
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:04,200
What else?

1502
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,200
No, no.

1503
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,500
They vary, they vary sort of region to region and family to family.

1504
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:15,440
But the way we make ours is, we use Ribena, I don't know if you have that in the US, but

1505
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,080
it's a blackcurrant squash.

1506
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:22,120
So you put some blackcurrant squash in a mug, you add to that some freshly squeezed lemon,

1507
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:30,320
a large spoon of honey, a generous measure of brandy, and then boiling water.

1508
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:34,640
And then you stir all that up together and you drink it as hot as it can be.

1509
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,040
Wow, I've never heard of that recipe.

1510
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,440
It's a cold remedy.

1511
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,640
You know, when you're feeling a bit bunged up, you know, it's got all the things in it,

1512
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:48,300
you know, the honey to soothe your throat, the lemon for the vitamin C, the brandy to

1513
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,360
sort of, you know, help with the chest.

1514
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,360
For the spirit.

1515
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,160
So, have one of those before you go to bed to help you get to sleep at night.

1516
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,920
Sounds like a great excuse.

1517
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:57,920
It does.

1518
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,600
Or in my case, two or three, because...

1519
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:05,880
And if you drink enough, you'll forget you're even sick at all.

1520
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,120
Right, yeah.

1521
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:10,060
Except for I actually have so much like sinus pressure right now that it's making me a little

1522
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,240
dizzy as it is.

1523
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,160
So like I had one beer that I sipped this whole episode because like I already feel

1524
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,400
a little intoxicated.

1525
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,840
Like I had a day quill earlier today, but I think it's worn off by now.

1526
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,440
So I think that's why all of a sudden the sinus pressure's like boom hitting me so hard

1527
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,120
because it's like wearing off during the show, which is like so stupid.

1528
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,080
But I only had one thing at day quill, so there you go.

1529
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,600
Day quill also makes me sleepy.

1530
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,360
All right, so let me go dig out this link.

1531
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,360
So where did you...

1532
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,360
Oh, I slacked it to you.

1533
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,360
Oh, you slacked it.

1534
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,360
You slacked it.

1535
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,360
I couldn't paste it elsewhere.

1536
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,360
You want it right in the iris?

1537
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,360
Yeah, if you would.

1538
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:39,360
I want to go...

1539
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,200
So let's get to the bottom of this.

1540
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,880
Let's see if this tells me where...

1541
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,880
Oh, shipping status.

1542
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,720
Okay, so we'll go over to the Purism blog.

1543
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,720
We'll check the shipping status.

1544
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,920
Let's see, updated December 21st.

1545
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,760
I believe I have the Rev 2 coming to me of the Librem 15.

1546
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,840
Says it's shipping now.

1547
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,720
Says it's shipping now.

1548
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,440
I thought it was going to say never, project canceled.

1549
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,440
We should set up a fake website.

1550
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,760
Rev 1 shipped June 2015, sold out.

1551
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,960
So I must not have gotten that one.

1552
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,200
It must be Librem 15 Rev.

1553
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,460
Then there's...

1554
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:13,460
So what's going on here?

1555
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,640
What's the difference between there is a Rev 2...

1556
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,600
There's two Rev 2s, and one ships in January, and one is shipping now.

1557
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,360
Do you have the hinge clutch cover?

1558
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,360
I don't know anything about that.

1559
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:26,360
All I know is I was one of the very first people to back it, and a lot of things have

1560
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,400
changed since then.

1561
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:30,800
I didn't even know they had multiple Revs, let alone different hinges.

1562
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,220
Or whatever the HKS location is.

1563
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:37,480
There's a 4K version, which is shipping February.

1564
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:41,960
As much as 4K is awesome, I sincerely hope that's not the one I get, because I specifically

1565
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:47,360
bought this laptop, because I need 1080p out, I need to build a mere 1080 from the machine

1566
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,520
here to the capture machine.

1567
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:54,800
And honestly, high DPI just needs another year for Linux, maybe, I don't know.

1568
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,800
So yeah, I hope I...

1569
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,800
I might.

1570
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,800
We'll see.

1571
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,800
Wimpy, what do you know?

1572
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,800
You're the one that pointed us to this.

1573
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,360
I know what you know now, because you've read the same blog that I have.

1574
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,840
Not so helpful.

1575
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:11,100
And I also saw a tweet earlier saying that if you'd chosen an international keyboard,

1576
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:16,480
so anything other than a US or UK keyboard layout, your devices would be delayed further

1577
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,480
still.

1578
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:24,920
And if you didn't want to have those delays, then to come and change your keyboard selection.

1579
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,920
I see.

1580
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,440
Okay, I see a lot of the difference in the Rev2 is all about the hardware kill switch

1581
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,440
location.

1582
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,440
I do like kill switches.

1583
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,440
Yeah.

1584
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,440
So either you'll get it soon...

1585
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,440
They don't work.

1586
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,440
They don't work?

1587
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,960
Do they not work?

1588
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:43,800
You want to see the blog from December the 10th, where they explain they don't work.

1589
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,800
Oh boy.

1590
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,800
Damn it.

1591
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:46,800
Damn it.

1592
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:52,560
In the meantime, I should have just bought an Oryx Pro.

1593
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,280
How many games do people buy in the Steam sales?

1594
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,280
I bought a couple.

1595
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,280
But I only...

1596
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,280
No.

1597
01:07:58,280 --> 01:07:59,280
Yeah, I only bought...

1598
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,280
I literally bought two.

1599
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,280
How many did you get?

1600
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,280
About 30.

1601
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,280
Really?

1602
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,240
Yeah, I think I only got two or three.

1603
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,880
I had a lot of games already.

1604
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,960
Yeah, I had about 30 games and I've got about 70 now.

1605
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,720
Now have you tried any of them?

1606
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:14,720
Yes.

1607
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:15,720
Yes.

1608
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,560
I'm big into Trine at the moment.

1609
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,560
Oh my God.

1610
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,560
Yeah, Trine is great.

1611
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,560
Trine is...

1612
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,560
I've never played Trine before, so I'm on the first Trine at the moment.

1613
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,720
Oh, I'm so excited for you.

1614
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,760
Yeah, Trine's gorgeous.

1615
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,200
Also playing Coffee and Dodgers as well.

1616
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,200
I'm enjoying that a lot.

1617
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,200
Yeah.

1618
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,200
Did you get all the Trines?

1619
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,200
I know Trine and...

1620
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,200
I did.

1621
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,040
I had a deal to get all of them for like $6 or something.

1622
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,040
Wow.

1623
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,040
No way.

1624
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,040
Wow.

1625
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,040
That's a great deal.

1626
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,040
Yeah, that's super cheap.

1627
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,040
I need three.

1628
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,040
I only have one and two.

1629
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,040
Yeah, three is a little different.

1630
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:46,040
It's got more of a 3D camera.

1631
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,040
Oh.

1632
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,040
I didn't buy it.

1633
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,040
I was totally in awe of that.

1634
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,040
When I started...

1635
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,040
Because I'm not a huge gamer.

1636
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,960
The last time I was seriously into games was sort of like PlayStation 2 era.

1637
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,520
So when it started up, it's just like, oh, this is so pretty.

1638
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,520
I just want to play it because it's pretty.

1639
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:01,520
Yeah, it's gorgeous.

1640
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,520
It's gorgeous.

1641
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:08,000
It's so packed with things and the subtlety of motion was just like, oh, this is too nice.

1642
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Yeah.

1643
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,560
And the mechanic of switching between different player characters is a fun one.

1644
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,360
That's a fun mechanic.

1645
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,800
I see here that distance is on sale if anyone wants to...

1646
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:19,800
Oh, yeah.

1647
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,800
I've got that too.

1648
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:21,800
Yeah.

1649
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,800
I've got that too.

1650
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,800
Yes.

1651
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:24,800
Yes, very nice.

1652
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,800
He had a jump on the top of his head, Chris.

1653
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,800
Yeah, I figured.

1654
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,800
I just...

1655
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:28,800
I just sucked.

1656
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,560
I need to get the controller out is what I need to do.

1657
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:36,880
I ended up getting GTA 5 and The Long Dark from Hinterland, which I'm more excited about

1658
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,200
playing because it's pretty good.

1659
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:44,200
Wimpy, how's the performance been for you?

1660
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,200
For what?

1661
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,200
Trying.

1662
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,200
Yeah, are you playing on the NUC?

1663
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,200
I am.

1664
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,200
I'm playing it on that new NUC.

1665
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,040
So far, I've played everything on the new NUC and not had any issues.

1666
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,840
And I'm playing it at Quad HD as well because I've got a new Quad HD.

1667
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,840
No kidding.

1668
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,840
Really?

1669
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,840
Yeah.

1670
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,840
Well, that is really cool.

1671
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,840
I was going to say, I wonder how it would do at higher resolution, but it sounds like

1672
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:01,840
it's pretty good.

1673
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,840
Okay.

1674
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,840
Yeah.

1675
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,840
Well, good enough for me.

1676
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,480
I mean, I've not actually looked to see how many frames per second it's producing because

1677
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:12,800
I didn't want to sort of find that it wasn't very high and I was then annoyed by that.

1678
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:17,040
So I haven't looked, but I haven't noticed anything that makes me think this isn't fast

1679
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,160
enough or responsive enough.

1680
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:23,040
But I've been using an Xbox 360 controller and I was like, hmm.

1681
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,440
And so I've ordered a Steam controller as well now.

1682
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,440
Look at you.

1683
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,440
You're going all in.

1684
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,440
That's funny.

1685
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:30,440
That's awesome.

1686
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,440
Yeah.

1687
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,800
My daughter's getting a bit older, so I've decided I need to up my gaming skills.

1688
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,800
It is a fun thing to do with the kids.

1689
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:38,800
They really need...

1690
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,800
Yeah.

1691
01:10:39,800 --> 01:11:00,920
I've got a couple of kids' games for her as well to have a play on.
