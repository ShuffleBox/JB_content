1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Have you noticed how just about every Linux news outlet

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is talking about Microsoft CBL Mariner distro?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,160
All at the same time right now.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,680
Just going by my feeds, and I even,

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,880
I'll put a link in the show notes to prove it,

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,960
I've literally counted a dozen stories written

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,880
in the past week-ish about CBL Mariner,

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,000
which is, I don't know, it's funny, I guess,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,120
because I thought everybody knew about this.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,240
I mean, clearly, clearly a few people

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,480
must have missed Linux Action News Win 86,

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,920
because that was back in April we talked about this thing.

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,320
I think so, okay, a quick recap.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,600
Microsoft's distro is called CBL Mariner.

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,760
Kind of a strange name, but CBL stands for Common Base Linux.

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,440
Clearly, they weren't trying to market this thing

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,320
outside of Microsoft.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,920
I guess they use it for all kinds of stuff,

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,840
but including containers in Azure's Kubernetes service.

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,760
And now, it's part of that secret sauce

21
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,480
making the GUI work on WSL.

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,320
Gee.

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Yeah, it's got all the bits in there

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,760
to make a base Linux system work.

25
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,360
Yeah, PulseAudio, Wayland, woo.

26
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Yeah, it does Wayland, isn't that funny?

27
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,200
What?

28
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,160
Yeah, we kind of broke it down in Linux Action News,

29
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,800
so you can check it out in episode 186.

30
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,600
And it's really Microsoft's just middle layer Linux.

31
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,040
They originally got it started in Azure,

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,000
and now they're using a custom RDP virtual channel,

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,960
using the RDP protocol,

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,640
and it talks to the Mariner's Western RDP server,

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,600
and it does the communications for the graphics,

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,360
for the video stuff, using Wayland,

37
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,440
and it uses PulseAudio to create an audio channel

38
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,640
that goes over that RDP connection,

39
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,600
which goes back to the Windows client,

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,040
running on the desktop.

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,000
And this is just something

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,280
that the Microsoft Linux engineers created,

43
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,560
so that way they have this middle layer here

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,760
to do this stuff for their Edge devices

45
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,480
and their cloud devices, and now for WSLG.

46
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,560
It is public, and of course, it's up on their GitHub,

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,040
but there's no official ready-to-go builds.

48
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,080
There are some tutorials you can find.

49
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,680
But interestingly, Wes,

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,720
did you know that CBL makes use of RPMs?

51
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,960
It's got tiny DNF for package management.

52
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,120
Is that right?

53
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,960
Yep.

54
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,560
This really is one of those situations with Linux

55
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,960
where anyone can make it useful, even Microsoft.

56
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Hello, friends, and welcome back

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,600
to your weekly Linux talk show.

58
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,440
My name is Chris.

59
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,280
My name is Wes.

60
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,520
Hello, Wes.

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,680
I see you brought the Pops with you.

62
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
I sure did.

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
We got some show dogs today.

64
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,440
This episode is brought to you

65
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,600
by the all-new A Cloud Guru,

66
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,120
the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux,

67
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,200
and other modern tech skills.

68
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,000
You know, they got hundreds of courses,

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,520
thousands of hands-on labs.

70
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,680
So get certified, get hired,

71
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,920
get learning at acloudguru.com.

72
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,160
Well, we got a big episode in 4.15.

73
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,520
You know, of course, probably everybody's wondering

74
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,200
if we're gonna talk about Valve's Steam Deck.

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,040
Yes, this week, if you hadn't heard, somehow,

76
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Valve announced a Linux-powered handheld device.

77
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,480
It's a handheld high-powered gaming device

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,520
that lets you take your Steam library with you

79
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,880
wherever you are.

80
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,120
It's got a beautiful seven-inch display,

81
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,960
ergonomic controls that are really built

82
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,840
for long play sessions,

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,720
and a new look for Steam designed for Steam Deck.

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,320
You can think about Steam Deck like a portable gaming PC

85
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,120
with built-in controllers.

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,400
We have, like, a million thoughts around this.

87
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,480
There's so much to talk about.

88
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,480
And there may be a turd floating in this party punch bowl,

89
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,720
a prolific Linux game porter.

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,480
Ethan Lee is gonna join us later in the show.

91
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,520
And he's gonna shed light

92
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,640
on maybe some of the negative ramifications

93
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,880
around Valve's effort for the Deck,

94
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,920
the way they're communicating and messaging to developers,

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,720
and what could be a negative

96
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,800
for the future native Linux games.

97
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,880
Ironically, the Deck may actually be bad news

98
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,920
for Linux gaming in some ways.

99
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,200
We're gonna get to all of that.

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,600
But first, we really should say

101
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,200
time-appropriate greetings to our virtual love.

102
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,240
Hello, Mumble Room!

103
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,280
Hello. Hello, Mumble Room.

104
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
Hello, Mumble Room.

105
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,320
Hello, everybody.

106
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,480
You know, this is kind of special.

107
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,160
I realized I looked at the calendar,

108
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,280
and I said, holy crap, Wes,

109
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,400
we've got three episodes left before I hit the road

110
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,080
and start heading towards Salt Lake City.

111
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,520
How is that happening?

112
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,200
Where did the time go?

113
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,040
I don't know.

114
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
We better start making plans.

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Should have made those plans a while ago, I think.

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,920
Yeah, yeah, I know, right?

117
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,600
I mean, right now, I've been so focused

118
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,240
on getting Lady Joops ready for the road,

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,560
because she's gotta be a home.

120
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,520
She's gonna have to be a production shop.

121
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,320
I mean, literally going from the roof down to the axles,

122
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,400
getting her ready to go,

123
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,120
because it's gonna be like a 5,000-mile journey,

124
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,920
and it's mostly over the Cascades and the Rockies.

125
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,000
Just a few mountains in the way.

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,120
Oh, my gosh.

127
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,400
So we kind of have something special

128
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,800
that is happening on the road trip.

129
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,040
Uncle Brent is gonna join us.

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,600
The kids, Hadeah and I,

131
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,800
Brent's gonna be on Lady Joops,

132
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,360
capturing the trip, capturing bits and moments

133
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,800
that we're gonna shape into content

134
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,120
for future exclusive releases

135
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,760
after we get back from the road trip.

136
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,800
Now, that sounds great,

137
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,520
and obviously, Brent's a great fit for that.

138
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,680
I'd like to know,

139
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,360
are you gonna teach him how to drive the rig?

140
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,760
Oh, you know what?

141
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,520
I hadn't thought about that.

142
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,920
There's very few people I would be willing

143
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,680
to let drive Lady Joops.

144
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,120
Rightly so, I mean, it's your home.

145
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,360
And Brent is one of them.

146
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
He is a terrific driver.

147
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,160
I have co-piloted with Brent before,

148
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,920
and I have seen him in action.

149
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,760
It definitely would take some training,

150
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,040
but one of the things he'll probably do is,

151
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,240
if he wants, is we're gonna have a chase vehicle.

152
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,720
We thought about towing it,

153
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,760
but with two other adults on board,

154
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,360
we think we're gonna do the chase thing

155
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,720
where we'll have another car with us,

156
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,280
and Brent can go and have his private time in that car.

157
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,360
He can listen to his audiobooks and his podcasts

158
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,320
and be on his own.

159
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,160
His own playlist.

160
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,840
For most of the day, if he wants.

161
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,160
And the nice thing about co-piloting,

162
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,760
or co-driving like that, is we both have radios.

163
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,560
So even if we don't have cell signal,

164
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,680
we can still quickly communicate with each other.

165
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,280
And if I see an obstruction on the road up ahead,

166
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,720
I can call back to him and I can say,

167
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,000
Brent, can you make me a hole?

168
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,160
And Brent will move over and block the oncoming traffic

169
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,720
so that way I can get chupes over

170
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,520
and then get back and going again.

171
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,760
So it's really nice to have,

172
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,360
or he can go and scout a gas station before I-

173
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,240
Right, go find some good landing spots for us.

174
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,680
And report back to the mothership.

175
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,640
And then when I get in range, he can radio me

176
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,360
and tell me, okay, you're looking good.

177
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,800
This is what Hadi and I do, too.

178
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,760
So that's extremely useful.

179
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,200
Or he could just ride along board and just chill out.

180
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,840
It's a nice view up front.

181
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,280
But the fun idea that we had was,

182
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,640
this seems like a great opportunity

183
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,800
to make some really fun content, some exclusive stuff,

184
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,680
because along this road trip,

185
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
not only are we gonna be meeting up

186
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,360
with Jupiter Broadcasting audience members,

187
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,000
but we're gonna be meeting up with team members,

188
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
members of the crew, and capturing those moments.

189
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,480
We haven't seen each other for a very long time.

190
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,920
It was a whole other world last time.

191
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,720
We have some friends that have been on the show before

192
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,920
that we're gonna be seeing along the way.

193
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,680
And then when we get to Salt Lake City,

194
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,840
we're gonna do an official meetup there.

195
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,160
We have some swag planned.

196
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,720
We're gonna have some swag on board juice.

197
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,200
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

198
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,040
Yep, yep.

199
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,960
It's the swag tour.

200
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,800
You know, one of the things about

201
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,200
since we went independent is,

202
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,280
we don't have a dedicated designer anymore.

203
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,560
And man, is that tricky.

204
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,280
And Linode stepped up in such a huge way.

205
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,280
They basically just got their design team together for us.

206
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,120
Wow.

207
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,680
And they've created stickers.

208
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,320
They've created stuff to go on the shirt.

209
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,720
We're gonna have some really cool exclusive swag.

210
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,920
Very awesome.

211
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,640
And if we have enough, we'll try to put some

212
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
on the garage afterwards.

213
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,240
But they've put together some awesome stickers

214
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,160
of Lady Joups on the road trip.

215
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,640
And they will also be giving away

216
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,160
like a couple of raspberry pies.

217
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh, ho, ho.

218
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,160
And doing a few other like raffle giveaways

219
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,280
at the Denver meetup.

220
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,200
So we got some plans.

221
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,000
We've got a couple locations.

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,920
I've pinged the meetup group in Salt Lake City

223
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,360
asking them for suggestions.

224
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,240
So if you're in the Salt Lake City area

225
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,000
and you can give us some suggestions on a venue.

226
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,680
You got that local expertise.

227
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,520
I was thinking like,

228
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,680
I mean, maybe we just do like a park with some shade

229
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,920
and we bring some food and some drinks or something.

230
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,240
I mean, we could do that too.

231
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,720
It doesn't have to be anything super fancy or it could be.

232
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,360
So meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

233
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,920
for the two official meetups that are on the books.

234
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,240
But then the plan is I'll have the live tracker with me.

235
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,520
And I'm gonna have a website at colonytracker.live

236
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,640
with a little link on there.

237
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,800
If you wanna do a micro meetup,

238
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,360
that's what I'm calling the live micro meetups.

239
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,640
You hit that little button.

240
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,520
I've created a specific form

241
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,680
that asks you a couple of questions

242
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,880
so we can arrange a meetup.

243
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,440
And that's gonna be all at colonytracker.live.

244
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,360
Your direct link to LadyJubes.

245
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
It's getting real close.

246
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,960
I don't know if we're gonna get everything done

247
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,360
in the three weeks.

248
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,600
It's pretty nuts when I think about it.

249
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,360
And then like, I realized Brent's gonna be on board

250
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,000
then he could join me for some of the shows.

251
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,840
Oh yeah.

252
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,880
I need to have like a two host setup in Jubes,

253
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,600
which has traditionally been a single host setup,

254
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,800
which means immediately I'm going to a mixer, right?

255
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,440
Like that's, so that added complication right there.

256
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,480
And last time I looked,

257
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,080
you didn't have a separate sound booth installed in the RV.

258
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,920
Okay, no.

259
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
I'm thinking like he'll be in the dinette

260
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,200
and I'll be in the upfront work area or something.

261
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
We'll just do a little bit of distance

262
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,800
and then rely on the sound isolation of our mics, I suppose.

263
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
But trying to just coordinate all of it together,

264
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,760
we're creating a new sleeping space in LadyJubes too.

265
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,920
So he, you know, has his own spot.

266
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,760
A bread box.

267
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,600
Yep.

268
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,000
And all that stuff.

269
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,840
Very excited.

270
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,560
He'd join us, but he's mid project right now.

271
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,720
So he can't really join us,

272
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,320
but it's all getting really close.

273
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,400
And then we'll be producing some shows on the road.

274
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,360
Of course, as well.

275
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,920
And then Wes is going to meet up with everyone

276
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,840
and all of us in Denver.

277
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,920
And we're going to do a Linux Unplugged in Denver.

278
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,960
From Denver.

279
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,280
I don't know where yet.

280
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,800
We don't actually have a place figured out to record yet.

281
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,640
Stay tuned.

282
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,000
So we got to figure that out.

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,960
I don't know how we're going to live stream it,

284
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,120
but we're going to try to do that.

285
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,280
I don't know how we're going to accommodate a mumble room too,

286
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,680
but we're going to try to do that.

287
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,920
I got to figure it all out.

288
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,120
Just a few small details.

289
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,960
And it should be fine.

290
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Cause you're going to get in the night before

291
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,080
and I'm going to get in the day before that.

292
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,000
It's plenty of time to figure this out.

293
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,200
Plenty of time.

294
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,040
Plenty of time.

295
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
There should be no interruptions.

296
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,760
However, if the show's a little weird that week,

297
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,760
you know, mid August, the week of the 20th,

298
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,040
you know, so about, you know, the episode,

299
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,520
like on the 17th or 18th, you know,

300
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,560
maybe give us a little latitude on that one.

301
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,840
You know, cause we're going to try our best,

302
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,000
but you never know what's going to happen

303
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,320
when you're kind of throwing it all together.

304
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,160
And if you are in that area and you know of a space

305
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,680
we could use to record for two of us.

306
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,520
Let us know.

307
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,600
Or maybe three, I don't know.

308
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,320
Or maybe, I mean, imagine if a few of our friends should,

309
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,160
maybe more.

310
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,000
It could be something.

311
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,840
What's going to happen?

312
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,680
Who knows?

313
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,200
Stay tuned and find out.

314
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,880
But we do have a lot to get to today,

315
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,360
including our chat with Ethan, which is,

316
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,240
I think it's extremely, extremely important.

317
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,200
It brings, it brings attention to a subject

318
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,840
that is completely getting lost

319
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,400
in the announcement of the deck,

320
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,320
which has otherwise been very positive.

321
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,920
So before we jump in all that and to give room for Ethan,

322
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,600
I want to say thanks to Linode.

323
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,560
Linode.com slash unplugged.

324
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,840
Go there to get $100 in credit

325
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,080
on a new account for 60 days, $100.

326
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,400
And of course you're supporting the show.

327
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,760
Linode is our hosting provider for everything we've built

328
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,000
in the last couple of years.

329
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,880
Their infrastructure is solid, it's fast, it's flexible.

330
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,480
You can focus on your project

331
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,920
and not on all the details of hosting a server,

332
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,560
but you can get down as deep as you like.

333
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,320
And they've got 11 data centers to choose from

334
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,840
and every service level, every single box you get

335
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,800
is backed by the best customer support in the business.

336
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,400
And when that matters, it makes all the difference.

337
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,000
And of course Linode is making our Jupiter Colony reunion

338
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
possible.

339
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,040
They have been so supportive, not only financially,

340
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,080
but by contributing the time of their designers,

341
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,960
contributing the time of some of their web developers.

342
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,280
And of course they're going to be making the meetups

343
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,520
even more awesome with swag and giveaways.

344
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,200
Like when I brought the idea up, it was like a co-idea.

345
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,640
They were like, you know, we'd love to do something.

346
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,640
And you know, we'd love the idea of a road trip.

347
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,320
And I was like, well, we want to do a road trip

348
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,760
and here's what we're talking about.

349
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
And it was just, it clicked immediately.

350
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,840
And they have been so supportive through all of this

351
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,520
because they really care about this.

352
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,720
Like what they have been focused on

353
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,440
throughout the entire thing is like,

354
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,760
when we get to that meetup, we just,

355
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,840
we want to talk to people.

356
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,720
We want to ask them what they think about Linode.

357
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,640
We want everybody to have a great time.

358
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,920
And it has been so easy to work with them

359
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,880
because that is their end goal in this.

360
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,200
And that has shined through when I've seen them support

361
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,520
other projects in the communities, distributions,

362
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,000
and of course events.

363
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,480
And now to see them help us make this reunion possible,

364
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,560
it's just been like, I don't know, man.

365
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,600
It just took my appreciation up for Linode

366
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,880
to a whole other level because of course

367
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,160
I've appreciated them for an extremely good

368
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,120
technical service that they've executed on extremely well

369
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,600
since 2003 and like, okay, I recognize that indie game

370
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,080
and I support that.

371
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,200
But then to just kind of see them step up in this way,

372
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,400
you know, the way they've contributed to the design team

373
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,560
and the web team time and really been there to like check in

374
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,800
and see what I think about what they're doing

375
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,080
and all that stuff, like just way above and beyond.

376
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,480
And it really shows the passion.

377
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,080
And that's the thing, the passion for the Linux community

378
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,880
and the passion for Linux itself.

379
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,760
And I could tell you so much about the service

380
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,800
and why we choose to use it,

381
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,200
but I think that $100 will do the speaking for itself.

382
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,080
So what I want you to do is go to linode.com slash unplugged,

383
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,680
get that $100 for a new account, try this stuff out,

384
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,960
build something, learn something.

385
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,120
And of course you support the show.

386
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,960
There's a lot of ways to host something.

387
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,640
And there's a lot of different companies

388
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,520
with weird, crazy funding schemes

389
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,640
that are trying to dump on the market.

390
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,080
There's only one that's like Linode,

391
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,480
that checks all the boxes, remains independent

392
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,560
and focuses on the things

393
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,280
that make running services on Linux excellent.

394
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,560
So go try it out at linode.com slash unplugged.

395
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,560
So the Steam Deck has been announced

396
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,000
and it's extremely impressive.

397
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
From a hardware perspective,

398
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,680
what they've managed to get in there

399
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,040
with the AMD chip in there, the screen,

400
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,080
the USB-C connectivity with an external dock,

401
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,000
and then the storage expansion via SD,

402
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,520
and then the form factor with the track pads,

403
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,480
a lot of things are checking my boxes.

404
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,320
Yeah, no kidding.

405
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,080
I think it's checking a lot of boxes around the community.

406
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,760
It seems like most of the people I know

407
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,800
are thinking about buying one

408
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,480
if they haven't already reserved one.

409
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,920
I decided to reserve one.

410
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,280
I decided to reserve the big boy

411
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,880
because it's also got the anti-reflective screen.

412
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,200
And I thought that just seemed like the way to go for me.

413
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,680
Long-term, I'm probably going to use it.

414
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,320
And I also, you know, I admittedly,

415
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,800
there's a dad factor in here for me.

416
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,720
This is sort of solving a problem.

417
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,360
My kids are getting to an age where they want to game

418
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,200
and they see their big brother doing it

419
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,920
and now they want to do it, you know, the younger girls.

420
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,200
But Dylan's got a pretty sweet gaming laptop, if I recall.

421
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,040
Yeah, and I just can't afford

422
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,760
to buy them all gaming laptops, right?

423
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,600
That's crazy.

424
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,360
Yeah, let alone laptops for yourself at some point.

425
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,200
But as a dad, like the idea

426
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,600
that we could all be multi-players, some gaming together,

427
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,840
like that sounds like some like good memories right there.

428
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,760
Yeah, that's the new dinner table.

429
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,200
And then that they can dock this, right?

430
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,600
That they can dock this and have a desktop PC.

431
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,520
With Linux just right there, yeah.

432
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,240
Yeah, big, that's a big deal for me at a price point

433
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,000
that I can swallow because I was willing

434
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,440
to get them switches, right, so.

435
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,280
It's not too different, yeah.

436
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,600
Yeah, this is, so from like the dad mode,

437
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,360
this is such a big deal for me.

438
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,600
And the reality is that Valve's clearly been working

439
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,360
on this for a very, very long time.

440
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,560
And they've also wrapped this up with a new pretty UI

441
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,280
and they are promising 100% Windows game compatibility

442
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,360
in the near future.

443
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,640
We definitely have some thoughts on how that might work out

444
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,400
as well as their new Arch base.

445
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,320
Yeah, oh boy.

446
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,680
Yeah, we'll do that in a little bit.

447
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,960
But first, we wanted to shine a light

448
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,280
on an area not getting very much coverage right now.

449
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,040
Some potential fallout from Valve's new focus

450
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,960
and that big drive for Proton compatibility.

451
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,480
Prolific Linux game porter and developer Ethan Lee

452
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,680
sounded the alarm bells about this on Twitter recently.

453
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,280
And he's been involved with some of our favorite games.

454
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,000
Late last night, we called him up

455
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,640
to discuss how the launch of the deck

456
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,040
might actually mean fewer native Linux games.

457
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,280
Ethan, thank you for joining me,

458
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,080
especially on the short notice.

459
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,000
I know, and please fill in the gaps here,

460
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,720
from my recollection, I know that you've been involved

461
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,400
with some of my favorite Linux game ports,

462
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,960
Streets of Rage 4, I believe there's a couple of others

463
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,680
in there, including V that I never know how to pronounce,

464
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,600
and more.

465
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,680
It's funny, because I've worked on too much stuff.

466
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,400
So I have to remember what I did recently.

467
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,920
Streets of Rage 4 is probably the most recent one

468
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,840
that people remember.

469
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:35,000
But there's also Fez, Celeste, Dream Daddy, Rogue Legacy.

470
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,960
And some libraries that Valve uses themselves as well.

471
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,440
Yeah, so mostly what I do is I make an X&A re-implementation

472
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,480
called FNA, and then alongside that, an XAudio 2

473
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,960
implementation called F-Audio.

474
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,920
And both of those, while they are actually

475
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,160
designed for native games, they actually

476
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,920
are now integrated into the official version of Wine

477
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,000
as the X&A re-implementation and as the XAudio 2

478
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,880
re-implementation.

479
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,000
Because I designed them, in addition

480
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,040
to making it easy to port stuff, to just be very accurate.

481
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,360
And so they were able to integrate that

482
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,400
into their software in a way that

483
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,560
helps with preservation, which is the main goal of both

484
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,520
of those libraries.

485
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,400
Sure.

486
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,840
And it sounds like, just from that overview,

487
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,840
that Linux native games and porting games

488
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,440
to be native on the Linux platform

489
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,560
was a big part of what you've done

490
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,840
and what your career has been.

491
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,680
And that might be changing now with the announcement

492
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,480
of the Steam Deck.

493
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,400
Yeah, so basically since April 2012.

494
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,680
So it's almost been 10 years.

495
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,040
It's getting close.

496
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,080
I've just been doing Linux game development

497
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,560
as my full-time thing.

498
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,000
It's always been my primary thing, first and foremost,

499
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,840
to do Linux games.

500
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,640
I did Mac versions alongside that

501
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,440
because, just culturally, those two happen to be very similar

502
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,640
and was an easy way to pitch a port.

503
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,360
That actually stopped this year.

504
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,960
So it was kind of strange to go from, in January, I said,

505
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,240
OK, no more Mac versions.

506
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
The ecosystem there is just too crazy.

507
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,080
And I like working on platforms where

508
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,840
I have a good relationship with the vendor,

509
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,640
and they are not too invasive.

510
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,880
Which, in hindsight, well, we'll get into that.

511
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,120
Yeah, so it seems like you're looking at it

512
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,440
even just a few months ago, and the situation's clear.

513
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,760
Apple has an agenda.

514
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,360
They have the M1 platform now.

515
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,880
They're really not focused on wide game compatibility.

516
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,080
It seemed like Linux would be the open platform.

517
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,160
But I noticed a couple of red flags

518
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,880
with the announcement of the Steam Deck,

519
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,280
and then I saw your Twitter feed.

520
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,120
But the first red flags I noticed,

521
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,160
the developer documentation.

522
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,520
So not just the promotional literature,

523
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,120
but the developer documentation really only talks about Proton.

524
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,800
There's a couple of slides that say native games are also

525
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,600
compatible, but all of the docs just say focus on Proton.

526
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,520
And then I saw your tweet that it

527
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,920
seems that some people have maybe even been contacted

528
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,360
suggesting that they should, instead

529
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,040
of focusing on a native version, just go ahead and just focus

530
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,800
on the Proton version.

531
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
And I'm getting mixed signals on if that's something

532
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,080
that Valve is pushing or not.

533
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,120
And it seems like you've gotten wind of this same issue,

534
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,600
and it seems alarming to you.

535
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,480
The Deck is the thing that's, I mean, we'll get to that.

536
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
But just for historical context, because I

537
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,560
think the context particularly matters,

538
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,000
both in the sense of where my role is in it

539
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,560
and where Valve might have been coming from originally.

540
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,600
So I think it was August 2018 that Proton ended up

541
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,320
being announced as a part of the Linux client, which

542
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,440
was exciting to me when I was always pitching

543
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
the idea of Steam for Linux.

544
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,720
It was always interesting to think about,

545
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,920
even if you assume from 2012 on when they started doing Linux

546
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,800
games for the Steam client natively,

547
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,280
you still have a decade or even more longer,

548
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,120
depending on what you consider older releases to be Windows

549
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,200
only games that are this giant back catalog problem

550
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,880
that they have to fight.

551
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,880
And so for me, when I saw Proton the first time,

552
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,480
it was like, oh, this is a great answer

553
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,680
to the back catalog problem.

554
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,320
And I think I ran a Mac fest panel about Proton

555
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,440
specifically and how it did a really fantastic job of kind

556
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,960
of filling in a gap.

557
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,920
Right, games that were never going to get ported to Linux.

558
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,760
The developers have long moved on.

559
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,920
Or don't even exist.

560
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,640
You couldn't even go back and say, hey,

561
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,780
do you want to kind of do a remaster or something

562
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,600
like that to make it.

563
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,960
And it was to the point where I was

564
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,600
kind of interested in working with it,

565
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,720
because it was something that I had,

566
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,280
even as a native developer, I was

567
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,780
interested in as something of a preservation project,

568
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,500
because FNA falls in that category, too,

569
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,320
where it's like there are XNA games made by these one man

570
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,600
development teams from like 10 years ago that kind of threw

571
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,160
an XNA version out there, and nobody knows where they are.

572
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,100
We have no idea what their identities are.

573
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,880
We just have this binary blob, and we

574
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,480
don't know what to do with it.

575
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,920
So I actually, from I want to say like October 2018

576
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,760
to like November 2019, I was technically on the Proton team.

577
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,120
My job basically was to implement the new XAudio 2

578
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,300
implementation that was causing a lot of problems for games,

579
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,040
because XAudio 2 is very, very low level,

580
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,680
and trying to do a high level emulation of it

581
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,960
is basically impossible.

582
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,000
And then kind of alongside that, we

583
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,520
decided to do XNA integration as well,

584
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,160
because it's not as big as the no AAA games made with XNA.

585
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,920
So it's kind of one of those things

586
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,120
that I don't know if they had to pitch it or anything.

587
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,040
It was just something that we could at least

588
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,200
justify as making 100% completion a viable thing.

589
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,320
But after that, once the integration was done,

590
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,600
it kind of became an interesting conversation of like,

591
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,760
well, is there anything else you think you'd like to do with us?

592
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,960
And I tried working on performance with them,

593
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,760
because obviously, historically, Wine

594
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,920
has kind of lagged in terms of performance,

595
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,600
particularly compared to Windows, which

596
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,100
is kind of a hard thing to compare.

597
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,600
But the point is, there is this emphasis

598
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,960
to make it more performant and as performant as Windows, which

599
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,280
actually is surprisingly viable in some cases.

600
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,200
So I tried doing that.

601
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,840
And then once that kind of was explored,

602
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,960
it was like, it started to lean like,

603
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,760
do you want to be a Wine developer?

604
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,040
And I said, no, because I mean, there's

605
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,840
an obvious conflict of interest there.

606
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,720
I would prefer that my time be spent making

607
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,100
native games and the technology that makes native games work

608
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,120
well.

609
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,640
So after that, I kind of went back

610
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,200
to native, where I made an emphasis

611
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,000
on trying to focus on native.

612
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And it went OK at first.

613
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,760
But within the last few years, it

614
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,960
became very noticeable that the line between native and Proton

615
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,200
was blurring, which, OK, sure, like Windows developers

616
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,520
like to not do work.

617
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,400
So being able to have that work done for them for free is fine.

618
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,080
But within the last year in particular,

619
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,440
I started noticing that developers

620
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,040
weren't talking to me anymore.

621
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,680
And if they were, they either were coming back to me

622
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,400
from their old games saying, like,

623
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,160
is this Proton something we need to worry about?

624
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,240
Or in some cases, was just flat out, OK, we have Proton now.

625
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,920
We don't need your services anymore.

626
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,120
It's done.

627
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,240
Some cases, I was able to kind of get against that.

628
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,520
I know Streets of Rage 4 was kind of an awkward situation

629
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,000
where it's one of those difficult parts where

630
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,160
I don't know the full story.

631
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,040
But you can tell it was definitely

632
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,920
a case where Valve actively got involved with the Windows

633
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,800
version and made it with Proton.

634
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,760
And when it came time to actually start

635
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,480
the work on the Linux version, there

636
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,280
was this awkward conversation where it's like, well,

637
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,200
do we need to?

638
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,440
Or is this enough to make it work?

639
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,520
And then luckily, they went through with it.

640
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,120
It took a long time because the pandemic kind of made

641
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,720
it difficult for QA to kind of check everything.

642
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,240
But having that awkward conversation combined

643
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,400
with the delays, it's a situation

644
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,520
that that's like the best case scenario for what

645
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,840
I've been experiencing.

646
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,400
Most of the time, it's just developers

647
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,560
just who I've previously worked with before just kind of shooing

648
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,920
you away or just ghosting me.

649
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,160
And you get the sense it's they've realized that we don't

650
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,360
really need to bother with this native port.

651
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,560
We can just make a few adjustments.

652
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,120
Even Valve's engineers will give us

653
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
the tips we need to make adjustments for Proton

654
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,760
compatibility, and that's good enough.

655
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,880
So that's sort of the thing is that there's this line that,

656
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,320
and keep in mind, we haven't even gotten to the deck yet.

657
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,160
This is like 2020.

658
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,440
This is like a year before.

659
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,360
And so there's this line that's not being drawn here

660
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,280
where it's like, OK, the whole point of the back catalog

661
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:43,320
problem was to kind of get a broad solution for a problem

662
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,040
that is very, very large in scale.

663
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,680
And while, of course, you're going to run into scenarios

664
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,840
where you have a single game and you want to explore it,

665
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,920
there is a very distinct line between trying

666
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,320
to come up with a solution that works

667
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,320
for a broad portion of the catalog

668
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,200
and starting to act as a specialist, including

669
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,240
developer outreach, where it's like, hey, that's

670
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,840
what I'm supposed to be doing.

671
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,520
It's my job to be the one who specializes the work

672
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,200
and does the outreach and uses my expertise.

673
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,680
And so there's this line that's blurred

674
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,120
where it's like, well, the only real difference

675
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,080
is that you and Valve, as far as we're concerned

676
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,800
and as far as we're being told, are basically the same thing.

677
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,880
But you cost money.

678
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,040
Yeah, it's hard to compete with free.

679
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,280
They're also promising less work, too,

680
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,560
and less time investment.

681
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,040
Yeah, and that's the thing that kind of becomes a struggle

682
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,000
because I would have, if there was a distinction

683
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,680
both in the internal process and in the way

684
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,640
they present the product in a way that

685
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,200
makes the distinction of what it takes

686
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,160
to make a really good native game

687
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,080
and what it takes to make it work in Proton,

688
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,640
both on the back end and what developers have to do.

689
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,960
And you really kind of make it clear

690
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,640
that there's a one size fits all versus a specialized

691
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,200
and who controls the product at its core.

692
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,920
It's like, it feels like a loss leader product

693
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,920
rather than a preservation product at this point.

694
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,120
It feels like we have this giant thing that, obviously,

695
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,280
I can't speak to how much it costs to develop Proton,

696
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,040
but you can probably take a guess,

697
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,200
given the gigantic size of the catalog combined

698
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
with the expertise that it takes to actually get

699
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,160
it to work with so many different things reliably.

700
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,920
And so it just feels like it's become this thing where

701
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,240
it's better for their image to not point any of that out.

702
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,000
And unfortunately, as a result, it

703
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
puts us in the native world in an extremely uncomfortable

704
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,480
position where we have to prove before we've even

705
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,240
started the pitch that what we're doing

706
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,800
makes sense, which is not uncommon.

707
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,160
Like, hey, it's hard to justify a Linux version

708
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,840
if you just go and say, let me do it.

709
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,000
Obviously, you have to be able to say it's a small audience,

710
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,040
but we can make it work.

711
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,280
You'll make your money.

712
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,040
It's not going to be a sunk cost.

713
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,320
We can make it work.

714
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,960
Versus, look, I know what Valve told you

715
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,600
that everything I'm about to tell you

716
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,560
is completely unnecessary.

717
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,840
But trust me, it's hard to undo the words of a multi-billion

718
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,040
dollar corporation.

719
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,240
Especially when it's offering to save them money.

720
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,720
That is very tricky.

721
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,880
And it seems also it gives Valve this ability

722
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,360
to ensure that there's going to be certain games

723
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,200
on their platform if they go this route.

724
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,640
I can see there's an incentive structure for Valve

725
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,920
to pursue this avenue.

726
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,640
Sure.

727
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,480
It gives them a bit of a guarantee

728
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,800
to be able to say that these games work

729
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,600
without having to consult somebody else.

730
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,280
Because I think for them, it's nice to be

731
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,760
able to have confidence in their own stuff

732
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,040
internally without having to depend on someone else.

733
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,400
I mean, any company is like that.

734
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,080
We like to have everything in-house.

735
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,600
I can kind of see that making even more, or at least becoming

736
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,520
even more of a priority when something like the deck

737
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,240
is being worked on.

738
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,960
Because that must have been in the works for a while.

739
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,680
Yes.

740
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,000
If you look at things like GameScope and other similar

741
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,520
types of investments that Valve have made outside of the Steam

742
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,000
client itself, you can see that this

743
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,960
is something that they've been thinking

744
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,240
about for a very long time.

745
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,840
Yeah.

746
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,000
And if they want others to sell hardware like this,

747
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,840
they're going to need some sort of compatibility guarantee,

748
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,800
some sort of middle layer that they control that

749
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,120
makes sure that the games run on all the different,

750
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,720
on the Dell version of the deck and the HP version of the deck.

751
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,640
Me and some other people were talking about this

752
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,280
earlier today.

753
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,000
When we try to compare the Steam Deck to the Steam machines,

754
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,700
we try to figure out what they wanted to correct

755
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,080
and what they haven't corrected or how they're

756
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,600
presenting the information.

757
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,400
It does seem like we're not entirely sure

758
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,180
what the difference is other than the catalog.

759
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,560
Because if the idea is that you're going to have other

760
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,800
vendors do this, what's different from this compared

761
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,720
to Steam machines other than the form factor?

762
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,800
Because I mean, I have a Steam machine here, actually.

763
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,480
And it's basically just a Dell device they put Linux on.

764
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,620
And that's kind of it.

765
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,760
It's cool that we have other people making the hardware.

766
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,520
But the hardware wasn't the problem.

767
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,520
I know everybody talks about the fact

768
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,640
that Linux would probably be more widely used

769
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,600
if it was pre-installed.

770
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,760
The Steam machines in particular made

771
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,560
me reconsider that argument.

772
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,720
Because the first thing that most people would do

773
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,960
is they just put Windows on it.

774
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,560
Because it turns out Steam OS versions just

775
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,520
happen to be cheaper.

776
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,080
And they can find Windows at a pretty steep discount

777
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,720
where they can just reuse product keys.

778
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,760
There's a million reasons that people would just

779
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,960
buy a Steam machine and then throw Windows on it.

780
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,640
So I think the software catalog for them

781
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,080
was a bigger concern here, which is why I think they're

782
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,160
being so aggressive about it and not really being

783
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,040
all that concerned about the consequences of what happens

784
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,800
to native developers at this point.

785
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,580
And do you think that would motivate them

786
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,240
to the point of discouraging native ports?

787
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,600
It's up in the air.

788
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,160
There are definitely some.

789
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,960
When I was talking about Valve reaching out to developers

790
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,720
about focusing on Proton despite having native versions,

791
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,400
there was a bit of context lost in that,

792
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,720
where it was a mixture of developers who historically

793
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,480
have always released native and may have always

794
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,600
been doing native anyway.

795
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:16,000
And then getting this weird email about, by the way,

796
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,600
you don't have to do this anymore.

797
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,260
And then there was the other half, which

798
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,800
is what I was talking about earlier,

799
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,840
which is developers who have historically released native

800
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,520
but may not have done it for their latest thing.

801
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,800
And suddenly, there's this whole argument,

802
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,280
like, oh, we don't need to worry about that anymore.

803
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,160
And here's this thing that shows us that you don't

804
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,600
have to worry about it anymore.

805
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,800
Yeah, and look at all this buzz, look at all this press,

806
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,560
and now look at these developer documents

807
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,280
that just say target Proton.

808
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,940
Right, and that was the thing that was really frustrating,

809
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,960
is knowing that, because again, this

810
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,120
is something that's been in development

811
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,240
for a very long time.

812
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,540
So it just is a little frustrating

813
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,280
that there was all this time, and obviously there

814
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,640
were lots of people working on this product from every angle.

815
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,280
We had people who, including people

816
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,080
who focus on Linux development, nobody looked at these docs

817
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,320
and stopped to say, should we maybe

818
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,720
have a line about it, like one?

819
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,400
And the wording of it just seems so careless, just so

820
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,640
unconcerned with the consequences of what

821
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,080
it would mean for an entire industry of developers,

822
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,720
for Valve of all people to say Linux native is unnecessary.

823
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,040
You don't think that's going to have some consequences to that?

824
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,480
And after that post came up, someone at Valve

825
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,220
did reach out and were kind of surprised about it.

826
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,720
Are you saying that someone at Valve

827
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,240
that contacted you was surprised by your tweet?

828
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,560
Yeah, I mean, hey, when something like that

829
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,840
gets that much attention, particularly if you

830
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,080
weren't expecting it, like it's.

831
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,760
Sure.

832
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,560
Yeah, I'll give them that.

833
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,280
And the fact that they did reach out is great.

834
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,080
But even after that conversation,

835
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,920
it just seems like the risk of atrophy

836
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,200
is not something they're thinking about.

837
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,880
Because let's say hypothetically that, OK, sure, everybody

838
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,920
gets on Proton.

839
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,040
The product does well.

840
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,500
And let's say hypothetically, there

841
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,440
is that performance delta that developers care about.

842
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,480
OK, but once you get to that point

843
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,360
and then you start to talk about native after the fact,

844
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,720
you have to consider what have native developers been

845
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,040
doing in that time?

846
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,840
Because I can tell you what I'm doing, which

847
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,080
is nothing, because there's nothing I can do.

848
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,640
I don't have clients anymore.

849
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,880
So is the characterization of the response sort of, well,

850
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,520
this is a stopgap measure.

851
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,000
This is a temporary thing just to get games on the device.

852
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,560
Was that the nature of the response?

853
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,880
I think that might be the nature of the whole strategy.

854
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,000
I mean, I don't think this is uniquely something

855
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,080
they told me just uniquely in private.

856
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,880
It seems to just be what they're thinking

857
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,680
in general, which they talk about things like, oh, you

858
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,640
can use Vulkan.

859
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,280
You can use something that's not a patented codec,

860
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,960
like use VP9 or whatever instead.

861
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,000
But that's the expectation that this is going

862
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,120
to take years to develop.

863
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,040
And that's assuming it happens.

864
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,640
So you're basically telling me that I,

865
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,440
as a one-man development team who

866
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,960
does Linux games, which already works on a very low budget,

867
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,080
you're expecting me to just accept

868
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,080
that I'm going to have this tank in revenue

869
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,640
and just activity in general.

870
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,040
And I'm just supposed to expect that

871
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,360
at some indeterminate period of time in the future

872
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,240
that suddenly it's going to turn back around based

873
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,440
on just a hypothetical idea that it's going to come back.

874
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,000
I have no material proof that's what's going to happen.

875
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,560
People may just stick with Proton.

876
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
They're happy with it.

877
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,640
They're moving on to the next game.

878
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,560
They don't even care.

879
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,120
Right.

880
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,840
Or it's just like, or maybe it won't happen.

881
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,420
I'm just going to lose all my customers,

882
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,560
and then the platform's going to fail.

883
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,540
And then it's just going to be yet another thing that's like,

884
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,960
well, it didn't even work this way,

885
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,640
so why should we care, period?

886
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,320
So there's all these risks that I'm just

887
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,020
expected as some random jerk in Georgia supposed to just accept.

888
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,560
And I'm just going to weather it out somehow.

889
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,640
Well, Valve is doing the math.

890
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,060
And you have to figure, they looked at the Steam machines

891
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,960
and they went, all right, this didn't

892
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,520
work for multiple reasons.

893
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
And one of them was game compatibility.

894
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,640
One of them might have been that they chose Debian

895
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,560
as their base.

896
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,360
The choice of Arch seems to be almost like a reactionary

897
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,120
choice to their Debian choice.

898
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,400
And now with Proton as this compatibility strategy,

899
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,740
and they've been investing quite a bit in other aspects

900
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,160
of the stack to improve performance.

901
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,360
And you look at it and you go, they're really

902
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,760
betting the farm on this.

903
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,520
Because this is for a corporation,

904
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,160
how many meetings must they have had?

905
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,360
How many people, how many staffers

906
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,920
must be working on this project for it

907
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,360
to extend over five years or something like that now?

908
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,760
I mean, it's remarkable.

909
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,820
And so you have to figure they are on such a course

910
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,320
with so much momentum that they're not really even giving

911
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,120
how it impacts independent developers like yourself

912
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,520
who are in that ecosystem.

913
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,960
They're not even really thinking about it.

914
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,520
Well, when you're that big, it's hard to measure.

915
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,280
Even factoring out Linux, for example,

916
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,960
Steam has kind of frustrated small developers

917
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,080
for quite a long time.

918
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,720
So this is just really my example of it,

919
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,680
where when you have a billion dollars to spend,

920
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,920
what's another million?

921
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,760
But hey, I wish I had a million to look at.

922
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,040
Yeah, yeah.

923
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,040
Do you plan to go back into Windows gaming?

924
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,160
What's your thoughts there?

925
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,560
Is this sort of ending your Linux gaming career?

926
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,520
It certainly is kind of putting a knife

927
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,840
into my Linux development career.

928
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,120
It would take a substantial turnaround.

929
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,900
Because the thing is, even if they

930
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,520
were to undo a ton of the stuff that they've done,

931
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,680
it's out in the wild.

932
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,800
And the impact on it, just as Proton has been,

933
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,920
even buying closed doors, has been pretty tremendous.

934
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,520
When I was having this conversation,

935
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,560
I was like, I went and I looked at the numbers one more time.

936
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,000
And you can see to the year, it just

937
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,480
comes crumbling down real quick.

938
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,000
So the fact that it's only getting worse

939
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,720
is definitely kind of sticking a knife into it.

940
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,480
But as a player, it's hard to say.

941
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,580
I still technically made a lot of games.

942
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,040
And it'd be fun to kind of be able to keep playing,

943
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,760
or maybe even keep supporting them,

944
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,040
depending on how aggressive the strategy is.

945
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,840
Maybe they just decide, oh, we're

946
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,120
just going to try and make all games Proton based.

947
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,040
I don't know if that's kind of outlandish of a claim to make.

948
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,440
But I don't know how desperate they're

949
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,200
going to be to get to the end of this compatibility problem.

950
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,360
And I've been using this stuff for over a decade.

951
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,600
It'd be a shame to throw it all away.

952
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,120
Indeed, indeed.

953
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,180
It kind of seems like the best hope

954
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,320
would be if game shops appreciated

955
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,580
the value of a native port, and they wanted that.

956
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,280
And I suppose the only way we're going to get that is if the customers

957
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,160
are asking for it.

958
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,620
Yeah, and that's the thing that's been really discouraging,

959
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,880
is kind of seeing the response to just the idea

960
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,920
that that might be what they're doing.

961
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,320
I mean, obviously, a couple of comments on the internet

962
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,520
doesn't represent a whole community.

963
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,400
But it really was just kind of seeing

964
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,440
that even after 10 years of making games,

965
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,740
like the attitude, even with my name on it,

966
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,240
was still basically good riddance,

967
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
was a little disheartening.

968
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,800
And it's difficult being as negative as this.

969
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,680
But being told that the last 10 years of your life

970
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,560
were unnecessary is a, I don't know

971
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,880
how I'm supposed to spin that in a positive way

972
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,120
without putting in a lot of mental gymnastics into it.

973
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:32,800
I understand.

974
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,720
I enjoy the games that you have been involved in.

975
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,800
And of course, I know a lot of our audience

976
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,960
very much does appreciate a native port of the game.

977
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,560
So you have supporters in our audience.

978
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,920
Well, keep in touch.

979
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,000
Just kind of let me know if any way which direction it does go, I suppose.

980
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,880
It's such a game changer now, to kind of use a horrible pun.

981
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,320
And we just don't really know.

982
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,680
But I do appreciate you informing us and enlightening us

983
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,840
of this side of it, because I think this is an aspect that just hasn't gotten

984
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,360
a lot of coverage in what has otherwise been a lot of excitement

985
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,280
around the deck.

986
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,480
Yeah, and it sucks to be the bad guy for something

987
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,780
that is actually kind of cool in terms of the hardware.

988
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:14,960
But I kind of have bills and stuff.

989
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,480
Developers got to eat.

990
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,560
Linux.entropy.works.

991
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,800
Use promo code love13 and save 15%.

992
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,800
Entropy is an industry-leading mobile and web development studio

993
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,120
based in the UK.

994
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,040
They have global clients, including Mars Wrigley, Walmart, MediaCom,

995
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,300
the Financial Times.

996
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,600
I mean, they're trusted by some of the biggest names in media content.

997
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,840
But Entropy isn't necessarily all about those big global corporations.

998
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,480
They love working with smaller businesses and startups.

999
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,000
They just love to realize really outstanding apps.

1000
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,800
That's it.

1001
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,720
And web applications, too.

1002
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,320
I'm talking mobile, desktop, the web.

1003
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,560
Entropy runs on Linux, and they're a bunch of Linux nerds.

1004
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,880
They have distro hoppers in their office.

1005
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,060
They love to geek out on Linux hardware.

1006
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,040
It's why they reached out to me, because they're listeners of the show.

1007
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,080
They're part of our community.

1008
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,040
And they use Ruby.

1009
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,240
And they use Ruby on Rails for web applications.

1010
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,200
And more and more, Flutter.

1011
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,400
Flutter for mobile, desktop, and for web apps.

1012
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,320
And that also, by the way, includes the Linux desktop.

1013
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,000
They have pioneered some of the most complex Flutter apps out there.

1014
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,360
The new Flutter reality is here.

1015
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,080
They've baked in image recognition and machine learning into some apps

1016
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,400
they're launching globally for Mars.

1017
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,400
With Flutter, Entropy can just rapidly build an iOS app, an Android app,

1018
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,080
and a Windows app, a Mac OS app, and yes, of course, a Linux app.

1019
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,000
And they can really do it in no time.

1020
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,640
They're already really one of the global leaders in Flutter development.

1021
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,240
They have dozens of deployments in the last year alone.

1022
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,320
So if you're thinking about taking the plunge into Flutter for a Linux desktop

1023
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,160
app, and you want to hit other platforms as well, maybe you're a small business,

1024
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,880
a large business, a startup, just kind of getting going.

1025
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,520
But you just want to get an outstanding app on a number of platforms,

1026
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,400
Entropy is ready to chat.

1027
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,600
They love to discuss ideas, and of course, love to share their opinions.

1028
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,320
And regardless if you want to move forward with a project, or maybe you just

1029
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,160
kind of want to get your head wrapped around some of this stuff,

1030
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,960
get an idea of what this looks like.

1031
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,840
Maybe you just want to discuss your favorite distro.

1032
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
Entropy would love to chat.

1033
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,880
So to get started, they're offering listeners of Linux Unplugged 15% off their

1034
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,360
first project.

1035
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,280
This is a great way to take the plunge.

1036
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,640
What an opportunity.

1037
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,040
And you're supporting a member of our community.

1038
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,360
You're shopping locally within the Linux community.

1039
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,280
So just head to linux.entropy.works and fill out one of their contact forms.

1040
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,640
But cite the promo code LUP13, and then they'll get in touch,

1041
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,160
and they'll get started.

1042
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,920
And there's never any pressure.

1043
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,280
They're always just happy to discuss your project and help in any way they can.

1044
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,840
That's linux.entropy.works, promo code LUP13.

1045
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:52,280
Since our chat with Ethan, we've thought a lot about some of the points he brought

1046
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,760
up, and we're very glad he raised them.

1047
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,360
I think this is a discussion that it's good for the community to have.

1048
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,080
We're in a sort of weird point in Linux gaming.

1049
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,640
And frankly, it's pretty tough to hear the troubles he's facing.

1050
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,040
I mean, he's made a lot of great games.

1051
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,600
He's doing really good and important and just neat work.

1052
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,640
It does kind of make sense.

1053
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,600
I can understand how Proton getting as good as it is has eaten up a lot of the

1054
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,560
air that used to exist here.

1055
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,760
Ethan mentioned not wanting to become a wine developer.

1056
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,640
And I get that, right?

1057
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,160
That's not why he got into this space.

1058
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,280
It's not what is exciting.

1059
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:24,760
Right.

1060
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,000
But at the same time, I don't know, it sort of seems, and I don't like saying it,

1061
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,920
but it sort of seems that if you want to be involved in the future of Linux gaming,

1062
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:37,880
at least as it stands right now, maybe you have to embrace Pivot to Proton.

1063
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,120
Okay, I think we could talk more about that, but I see where you're going.

1064
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,360
In some ways, it's sort of like Electron or Flutter at the high level where we're

1065
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,800
getting what we want, whether that's the app you need for work on the desktop or

1066
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,360
it's the game you wanted to play without having to install Windows.

1067
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:57,880
We're getting all that on Linux, but we're not getting it with our tools and

1068
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,240
our philosophy baked in.

1069
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,360
And I think that's a little bit of a tough pill to swallow sometimes.

1070
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:02,600
Yeah.

1071
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,120
And the Proton games don't necessarily have all of the functionality you want.

1072
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,280
Sometimes they're lacking in multiplayer functionality or

1073
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,880
currently anti-cheat functionality.

1074
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:16,520
But after talking with Ethan, I kind of thought I could see Valve looked at that

1075
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,680
first attempt with Steam Machines and they said, okay, what went wrong?

1076
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,200
And they went down a list and they said, well, it was pretty hard actually basing

1077
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,240
on Debian because we're doing all this work upstream, but then it takes forever

1078
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,520
to get to Debian.

1079
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,320
Well, you know what?

1080
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,960
It was pretty rough getting the games to run because we didn't have Proton at that

1081
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,280
time.

1082
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:34,760
Right.

1083
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,000
So compatibility was a joke and people weren't really that keen to port their games.

1084
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,680
And of course, there was a weird third party ecosystem in there and I could see

1085
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,920
them looking at this going, that was a failure.

1086
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,120
And what I could see them doing now when they take more of a console look at it,

1087
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,200
a handheld console look, is I could see the focus on Proton being a way to

1088
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,680
prevent failure.

1089
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,920
Like it's this insurance layer, it's this middle layer that they can guarantee

1090
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,080
that's going to work and that it'll work across any third party maker of a deck

1091
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,640
as well. And they could just say, you know, we looked at going native, but guys

1092
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,560
like Ethan, they only scale so far.

1093
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,320
There's only so many developers in the world and we want all game compatibility.

1094
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,000
We don't want just the native games.

1095
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,880
And you can see how from a business case, too, that this sort of keeps it under

1096
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,800
their own control where it's like, well, this is our layer.

1097
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,880
We can guarantee that you'll have these API endpoints and not, yeah, you know,

1098
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,640
we'd really like you to target native Linux.

1099
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,680
Here's a list of some people you could try and work with to get there.

1100
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,800
I mean, that would be great to see and I think that could still be a part of the

1101
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,320
option, but you can see how that wouldn't maybe be enough for that big push here.

1102
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,200
And I think the other thing, too, since they launched the steam machines is

1103
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,680
Vulcan didn't become like this universal across all platforms standard that we

1104
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,520
hoped it definitely is great.

1105
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,480
But DirectX has really continued to thrive in the Microsoft ecosystem, and

1106
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,280
that is a massive reality of the marketplace.

1107
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,480
And I think this isn't this isn't the same thing as steam machines.

1108
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,400
These are not steam machines 2.0.

1109
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,360
And I think there's probably a few key reasons for that.

1110
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,040
Number one, steam machines were really just entirely a third party hardware

1111
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,480
thing that the makers really just didn't make much money.

1112
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,640
There was like a bad incentive structure there.

1113
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,120
Additionally, steam input, it was a baby compared to where it's at now.

1114
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,160
Third party controllers were nowhere where they're at now.

1115
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,160
And it didn't really kind of work for the demo because just about everybody who

1116
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:32,120
had a big steam library that would find value in a steam machine already had a

1117
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:36,040
gaming PC and then Val very quickly cut their legs out underneath the steam

1118
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,400
machine by coming up with the steam link, which just took your already existing

1119
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,640
expensive PC and made it work on your TV.

1120
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:44,360
And gamers already had Xboxes.

1121
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,960
Proton wasn't a thing.

1122
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,440
So there wasn't really this Linux compatibility story.

1123
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,880
And they just failed.

1124
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,560
It just was it was a flop.

1125
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,400
And I think that flop was a harder pill to swallow.

1126
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,920
And now they look at the market in a probably a much more practical.

1127
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,080
We're just going to fix base OS problems.

1128
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,960
And you can hear this in their interviews, like with IGN.

1129
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,160
The way they talk about it is, well, we solve some core OS problems.

1130
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,560
And then we built up this proton layer as a middle layer.

1131
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,160
And now we're shipping the deck.

1132
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:17,400
And they don't they don't think about it in terms of native games.

1133
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,200
They just think about it as a game runtime environment that includes all of

1134
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,640
the steam bits, including their their super old Ubuntu base.

1135
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:25,880
Right.

1136
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:31,080
Yeah, really, it's a hodgepodge of magic stuff to make games play at the end of the day.

1137
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:31,880
All right.

1138
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,040
So let's get into our first email of the day.

1139
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,040
Gabe writes in.

1140
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,840
Hey, Chris and Wes, if Valve called you up and asked you for some top tips on how to

1141
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:46,200
successfully ship Arch on the new Steam Deck, what might you advise them to do?

1142
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,480
Ah, based on all of our pro experience, of course, with our server, I assume.

1143
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,520
That uptime, baby.

1144
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:50,680
Yeah.

1145
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:55,080
Well, number one, Gabe, is don't don't wait about six months between updates.

1146
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,120
Don't don't do that.

1147
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,760
But in all seriousness, how would you ship Arch on a mass consumer device?

1148
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:05,080
Yeah, I mean, you're going to need to introduce some kind of control, whether that's image

1149
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,760
base or something more like Manjaro, where, you know, you have your own repos that you're

1150
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,880
maintaining and you can sort of keep packages at a stable place.

1151
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,520
That's my bet.

1152
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,920
That's what I don't think that's the solution I'd prefer.

1153
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,240
But I think that's the solution they're going to go with.

1154
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,960
Well, because you need some level of curation rate just just for QA purposes, at least.

1155
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,600
Yeah, and you don't want like weird like libraries coming down, breaking things and whatnot.

1156
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,440
So I think that would be one of them.

1157
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,520
I think you got to also do a minimum viable Linux install.

1158
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,200
That's one of the things we did on our server.

1159
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,880
Minimum viable Linux install.

1160
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,680
And I'm going to say it.

1161
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,880
I think they should use ButterFS on the root file system.

1162
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,880
Oh, going bold with this one.

1163
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,840
You need something that has low resource impact.

1164
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,640
You need something that works well on a single SSD.

1165
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,200
And it'd be great to have something that supports snapshots.

1166
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,200
Right, so that even if you might have some sort of arch breakage, you can be somewhat

1167
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,160
guaranteed you can just reboot back into a snapshot.

1168
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,520
What about the kernel?

1169
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,280
Because if you go LTS kernel, you're not necessarily going to have all the hardware

1170
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,640
support you need, possibly.

1171
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,920
You know, that might be one spot where they're just going to compile it themselves.

1172
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,600
I wonder, you know, maybe maybe trying to tweak things for performance or otherwise,

1173
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,360
or they just want the latest and greatest.

1174
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,200
Does anyone in the Mumble Room have a have a hot tip for Valve on how to ship this thing

1175
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,760
in a way that's usable by consumers?

1176
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,120
I guess I'll have the hot tip.

1177
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,280
And I'm going to I'm going to say the most probably traumatic slash controversial statement.

1178
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:32,520
Fork the entire package set, because when you're working with delivering a product,

1179
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,040
you need to be able to have testable checkpoints.

1180
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:41,560
And the easiest way to do that when you're building a full scale product, soup to nuts,

1181
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,120
where you have both you're controlling the kernel as well as going all the way up to

1182
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:52,600
things like the user space, the desktop and and fiddly bits here and there is branch the

1183
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:58,520
entire distribution, filter out what you don't need, build it, integrate it and release it

1184
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:04,200
on your own schedule, because that way you can ensure consistent quality and you can

1185
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,960
work around the the underlying faults in the software management stack to make sure that

1186
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,960
upgrades are not going to be painful.

1187
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:17,000
Because in a traditional arch setup, it is fairly common for people to have to manually

1188
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,360
work through upgrades, especially with more invasive things or stuff where like library

1189
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,840
switching happens and things like that.

1190
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:28,840
So those are things that are not acceptable for a product.

1191
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:34,360
And in order to mitigate that, you need to take the whole thing into your hands and deal

1192
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,080
with it.

1193
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,920
Dan, you have a lot of experience about shipping arch on mobile devices from Angera.

1194
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,040
Do you have any thoughts?

1195
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,800
Not other than it's hard to get a kernel just right.

1196
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:49,320
So you need to compile that yourself if you want to actually get it working for the device

1197
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,280
you're shipping it on.

1198
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:50,520
Sure.

1199
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,400
So you agree with Wes.

1200
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,560
We're probably going to see a custom kernel on this thing.

1201
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,520
Yeah, yeah, I do.

1202
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,120
Yeah, that wouldn't be too surprising.

1203
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,080
They were already doing that for the Debian steam OS, for what it's worth.

1204
00:48:59,080 --> 00:48:59,800
Ah, fair point.

1205
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,200
Sure.

1206
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,240
Yeah, fair point.

1207
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:06,520
Additionally, they already have a an arch repo with their own custom kernel, a patch

1208
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,960
kernel with the Linux fsync, I think.

1209
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,520
Right.

1210
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:15,880
They originally created it for shipping the Mesa ACO stuff that they were working on.

1211
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,560
I think it was, what, a year ago, two years ago, three years ago.

1212
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:25,240
I forget exactly when, but when they were first working with Red Hat on the ACO Vulkan

1213
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:31,720
stuff for AMD on Mesa, they created this AUR repository to ship it.

1214
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,200
I shouldn't call it an AUR repository.

1215
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,240
That's not what it is.

1216
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:40,840
It's an arch Pac-Man repository, and they created it so that they could ship it to people

1217
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,960
to test it and use it.

1218
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,760
It's being reused for everything else.

1219
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,160
But hey, that's that's where it started from.

1220
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:47,480
Right.

1221
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:52,920
OK, you know, and as far as the reliance on Proton, it definitely seems like a concern,

1222
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,880
especially if if game shops see it, it's just like a super easy, like easy button to get

1223
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,280
stack support or if that's all they're willing to do as well.

1224
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,320
You know, like if that's like, oh, well, that's all we care about.

1225
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,040
It doesn't matter that it doesn't run on your other Linux over here.

1226
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,240
We weren't going for Linux support.

1227
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,240
We were going to click the box to go on the deck.

1228
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,960
But doesn't that long term undermine Valve because they essentially become reliant on

1229
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,040
DirectX and Microsoft's gaming platform, which is in direct competition with them.

1230
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:25,720
So doesn't long term Proton kind of undermine Valve's position because they could become

1231
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,640
wholly reliant on their competitor?

1232
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,840
Yet they develop, you know, push their own sort of alternatives or does do Proton evolve

1233
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,680
as it needs to and at some point maybe split off from some of the space?

1234
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,480
It seemed like the way Ethan characterized some of the responses from Valve that potentially

1235
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,600
Valve is just pitching this as a transition technology.

1236
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,440
But I think Ethan's response to that was, yeah, but it'll become permanent.

1237
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,960
Like it's that temporary solution will become the permanent solution.

1238
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,320
It just works, you know.

1239
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,200
Good enough.

1240
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,080
Yeah, but Valve could be creating themselves a new cage by becoming so dependent on DirectX.

1241
00:50:59,080 --> 00:50:59,720
I'll leave it.

1242
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,560
You know, I want to say a note about this.

1243
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:07,320
Like when we're talking about Proton versus native Linux, I want to just say something,

1244
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:12,200
a particular quote, a better Windows than Windows and a better DOS than DOS.

1245
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:18,600
The operating system that used that slogan is no longer with us because emphasizing that

1246
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:25,320
point made it so difficult to convince people to build for that platform that it couldn't

1247
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:30,440
survive when more investment was required to make it successful.

1248
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,400
And that platform was IBM's Operating System 2 or OS2.

1249
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:35,960
Yep.

1250
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,440
Yep.

1251
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,240
Good point.

1252
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:37,480
All right.

1253
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,480
Well, we've got some more feedback.

1254
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,240
Mark has a distro that Chris and young Wesley might like to kick the tires of.

1255
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,440
That one made me chuckle young Wesley.

1256
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:48,920
Love it.

1257
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,480
And thank you.

1258
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:50,760
Yes.

1259
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:57,320
So this is Mofo Linux, Linux designed to defeat state censorship and surveillance.

1260
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,320
Yeah, I meant to give this a go this morning.

1261
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:03,320
But then I got distracted with all of the tech stuff.

1262
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:07,480
But Mofo Linux is like fight the man with Linux.

1263
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,320
And it's at mofolinux.com.

1264
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,440
And it is, well, it's a unique website.

1265
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,240
I'll give it that.

1266
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,880
It pitches itself as having a few things out of the box that make it more secure, like encrypted

1267
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:23,880
DNS over TLS that has open VPN and Tor set up ready to go and a bunch of software tools that

1268
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,440
are meant to anonymize your use of the internet.

1269
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,880
They want to be pretty clear about this.

1270
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,920
This is not simply an Ubuntu ISO with crypto and VPN applications added.

1271
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,840
The system has been stripped, de-bloated and optimized to help you break out

1272
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,360
and access the global internet.

1273
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:44,040
I love it when somebody uses a base distro and then craps on it by saying like we've

1274
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:44,840
de-bloated it.

1275
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,480
Well, why'd you pick a bloated distro to begin with there, hotshot?

1276
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,160
And like, why you got to crap on the people that made your distro possible as you're

1277
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,040
building your distro?

1278
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:55,560
But either way, it definitely is a distribution with attitude.

1279
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,000
And so I wanted to kick the tires before the show.

1280
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,040
But then that chance to chat with Ethan came up.

1281
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,880
But they pitch it as something you could boot on a live environment.

1282
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,320
So it'd be pretty easy to try it out.

1283
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,360
So I might give it a go after.

1284
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,360
Yeah, something to throw for a future episode.

1285
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,120
And I love the name, right?

1286
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,720
I mean, Mofo Linux.

1287
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,680
That's pretty great.

1288
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:20,360
Matt writes in, I was wondering if you all could recommend a VPN device that had a Linux

1289
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,720
client or service.

1290
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,160
We use checkpoint firewalls and it doesn't have a Linux client.

1291
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,200
We have to use Windows.

1292
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,200
So any recommendations would be great.

1293
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,080
I've recently just started listening to the podcast and enjoy learning about Linux and

1294
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,280
various distros.

1295
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,400
Thanks, Matt.

1296
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:39,720
West, I know we both are in a long term committed relationship to WireGuard.

1297
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,440
Yeah, true.

1298
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,320
And we shall never stray.

1299
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,560
But do you have any VPNs on the side?

1300
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:51,480
Well, I have some VPNs I use just for connecting out when I want to not be geo blocked by things

1301
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,320
or if I'm traveling and the hotel has sort of sketchy Wi-Fi, things like that.

1302
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:59,560
So yeah, I do rely on some third party VPN services from time to time, some of which

1303
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,120
now have WireGuard, which is very nice to see.

1304
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:05,000
But of course, they all have open VPN, too.

1305
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,280
Do you have one you recommend?

1306
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,440
I've been using TorGuard, but really, that's just because I paid for some discounted multi

1307
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,800
year account ages ago.

1308
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:17,480
And I know some folks are really picky and rightfully so about how good is their policy

1309
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,720
around their logging and is there evidence around has that come up in court before?

1310
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,680
And those are all good things.

1311
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,000
I don't use it for that kind of stuff.

1312
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,360
It's casual security layer that I just layer on top to get around whatever local network

1313
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm on.

1314
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,680
But they have a Linux client.

1315
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,320
They publish just open VPN config files.

1316
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,560
They've added WireGuard support to just about all their servers.

1317
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,320
So I've had no reason to switch.

1318
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,040
That's the two things.

1319
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,640
If they have WireGuard support, great.

1320
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:45,800
If they don't, if they have open VPN, if they can just provide you a config file, you can

1321
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,360
just use Network Manager, Provado VPN.

1322
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,800
They've been a sponsor on SSH before on Self-hosted, so disclaimer.

1323
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,240
But I really like Provado because they have a free tier that pretty much lets you do everything

1324
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:55,720
you want.

1325
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:59,080
And then if you want to get into like peer to peer software and that kind of stuff, they

1326
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,360
have a paid tier that works for that.

1327
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,960
So that's Provado VPN.

1328
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:07,640
And then I also have a NordVPN account that I use for content bypassing because they have

1329
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,080
an Android TV app.

1330
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:14,680
But I was just on this week's Destination Linux podcast, episode 235.

1331
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:20,280
And VPNs that work with Linux was one of the topics we kicked around, as well as we all

1332
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,280
chimed in on the Steam Deck, of course.

1333
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,680
So I got a chance to hang out with my buddies.

1334
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,320
It's been a while.

1335
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:31,160
And that's episode 235, which we will have linked in the show notes for that.

1336
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:31,480
All right.

1337
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,320
So we just have a couple of emails about Rocky Linux, and then we're going to wrap up the

1338
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,440
feedback.

1339
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,840
Wes, do you want to take the first one?

1340
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,080
Yeah.

1341
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:39,960
Morgan writes in.

1342
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,240
Hey, all.

1343
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,200
Linux HPC sysadmin here.

1344
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,000
That's high performance computing, if you're not familiar.

1345
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,480
Just wanted to tip you off as to where I see academic HPC systems going.

1346
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:57,720
I know of two Ivy League schools that have effectively decided on Rocky Linux as their

1347
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:03,800
centos replacement for some or maybe all of their research computing clusters.

1348
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,080
These can be some pretty big clusters.

1349
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:10,280
I can't share details, but we, the academic HPC industry, have kind of all been waiting

1350
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,280
to see where CERN went after the centos announcement.

1351
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,680
They've been very slow, likely waiting on the Rocky release before deciding between

1352
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,880
Alma and Rocky.

1353
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:25,640
Unfortunately, for the discussions I've been in, Rocky always has a leg up.

1354
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:32,280
Though I think this might just have been some name recognition, think centos co-founder.

1355
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,720
I don't make the rules.

1356
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,040
I simply live comfortably beneath them.

1357
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,600
It's amazing the mileage that story gets, isn't it?

1358
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,800
It really is.

1359
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:44,120
Anyway, I just figured it was worth mentioning that thousands of our servers will most likely

1360
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,240
move to whatever CERN ends up switching to.

1361
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,280
Something to watch.

1362
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,640
Yeah, so this is a really fascinating moment we are in because we have a clock.

1363
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:59,320
There's a countdown we have until the end of December for the people that are just die

1364
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,040
hard, traditional centos release model, they have to make a choice.

1365
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:04,680
And that's hard, right?

1366
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:08,600
Where we've talked so much that really what's going to help you make a choice is going to

1367
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,040
be way down the road at this point.

1368
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:10,280
Right.

1369
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:14,600
It's like these distributions, this enterprise thing, it's a long term thing.

1370
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,960
We won't know for a few years which was really the best contender.

1371
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,320
And right now they're technically very similar.

1372
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:26,200
So what you end up having to kind of go by is all of the stuff that surrounds the distribution,

1373
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:30,760
like the engineers or the or the or the foundation behind it or the structure of the company

1374
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,240
or whatever.

1375
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,640
And that is sort of all we have right now.

1376
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,000
Crystal writes in.

1377
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,880
She says, I was struck by the chat with Jack from Alma Linux.

1378
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,480
It seemed like a lot was covered that Rocky Linux would want to respond to.

1379
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,360
I know you mentioned you invited them on the show, but what happened with that?

1380
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:50,200
Keep up the great work and thanks for helping those of us trying to choose between Rocky

1381
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,240
and Alma Linux.

1382
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:59,400
So we did we did invite Greg and the community manager from Rocky Linux on the show via email.

1383
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:04,200
In fact, we even held our chat with Jack for a week so that way we had we gave them a week

1384
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,920
to answer the email instead of answering the email, though they did show up in the IRC

1385
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,880
chat during the live show a couple of weeks ago.

1386
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,000
It started pretty good.

1387
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:18,520
We linked the log in the last week's episode, if you're interested, and then it kind of

1388
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,720
slid downhill.

1389
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,120
It kind of got a little rough.

1390
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,120
I think it's a real shame that Rocky Linux chose not to come on the show.

1391
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,600
I'll read you the email they sent me.

1392
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,600
I think it's a little disingenuous and I'll link the full email in the show notes.

1393
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,360
But in here, Stack writes, the Rocky team talked afterwards.

1394
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:40,200
This is after the little IRC incident that happened during our live show.

1395
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,160
He says, the Rocky team talked afterwards.

1396
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:48,440
We're going to attempt to further disassociate comparisons between Rocky and others.

1397
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:53,080
And others, like all the Linux, which right there, that's such crap.

1398
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:57,160
I mean, I hate to say this, but that's what everybody's doing right now.

1399
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,600
People want to know which one to go with.

1400
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,040
That's the very focus right now is comparing the two.

1401
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,680
Stack goes on to say, because Greg couldn't be bothered to write the email himself, but

1402
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:11,000
Stack goes on to say, we just don't feel like it's helpful to contrast and compare when

1403
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,080
the goal for most of these projects is to be one to one with Upstream and provide awesome

1404
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,120
community support.

1405
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:22,680
We would rather be in a position to lift Rocky and the community and others, like Alma, lift

1406
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:26,760
them up and then try to make ourselves out to be something better than we are.

1407
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:33,160
And so because that is their goal, they just couldn't make it to come on the show and respond

1408
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:33,560
to us.

1409
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:39,160
And unfortunately, all I really have is my personal experience and interactions with

1410
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:44,360
Greg and the team, which is I went out of my way to contact them and try to get them

1411
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:44,920
involved.

1412
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,000
It felt like for a brief moment, we had an opportunity for an impartial body to be a

1413
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,160
bridge that creates a community of enterprise distros.

1414
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:55,160
And that seemed like something new and special.

1415
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,000
I was really excited about that.

1416
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:04,040
But the conversations that we had and the way that things went down in the IRC, it made

1417
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,240
it clear that wasn't going to happen.

1418
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:11,320
And instead of extending that bridge, in my opinion, Greg proactively went to the register

1419
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:16,440
and got a softball interview where he claims to have seen the light and seen the way on

1420
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,320
how all of this works.

1421
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,920
Now he now understands the genius behind sent off stream.

1422
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:26,040
And the last bit to help connect all the dots was Neil.

1423
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:28,040
It was Neil in our chat room.

1424
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,640
He shook sense into Greg and now he's seen the light.

1425
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,360
Of course, it wasn't the entire conversation that we had with Jack because you'd never

1426
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,960
want to give all money credit.

1427
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,960
It wasn't the points brought up in the chat room.

1428
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,400
I mean, Neil deserves all the credit in the world.

1429
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,200
He works his ass off.

1430
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,560
But let's be frank, these are all things that Greg already knew.

1431
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,520
And then instead of coming on the show, he went and got a softball interview at the register

1432
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,360
a few days before our episode came out.

1433
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:53,800
And he knew it was coming out because I had the courtesy of giving him a heads up over

1434
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,300
email.

1435
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,400
And that's just my personal experience with the guy.

1436
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:03,880
And what I saw was a lot of show and not an actual lot of delivery there.

1437
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:09,320
And what I see and just in my in my personal experience, what I see is I see Jack from

1438
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,320
Alma Linux in our Mumble Room right now.

1439
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,840
You know, he doesn't have access to our show notes.

1440
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,200
He doesn't know what we're talking about.

1441
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,320
But I see somebody from Alma Linux showing up to be part of the conversation.

1442
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:23,880
And I can tell you this, having been creating Linux content for 13 years now, I can tell

1443
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:28,360
you that the projects that show up and participate at this level that have this kind of passion

1444
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:34,760
always sort of have the morality and the compass that agrees with my personal tastes and my

1445
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:35,720
moralities.

1446
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,320
They tend to be people that are truly in it for the greater good.

1447
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,080
They want to be communicative with the community so that way they can convey their ideas and

1448
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,240
try to get acceptance at every level and try to reach at the grassroots level of the community,

1449
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,640
which is how you have to get a conversation like this started.

1450
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,840
The people that get that, they get the way free software works.

1451
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,640
They get the way that working within the free software, the dynamics of that.

1452
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,120
And those are the projects that tend to be in it for the right reasons for the long term.

1453
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:07,400
And in my estimation right now, without much more to go on, I've had a pretty gross interaction

1454
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,000
with the Rocky Linux folks.

1455
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:13,000
And then the actions I saw them take afterwards and the words that they use to try to convince

1456
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,520
me why they're not coming on the show felt very manipulative, all in my opinion, of course.

1457
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,640
And what I've seen from Alma Linux is a track record that already exists for 10 years.

1458
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:25,880
Engineers on staff that seem like they could very likely actually contribute upstream to

1459
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:30,760
CentOS stream, which means they could actually make an impact on RHEL, which is an opportunity

1460
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,880
we have never seen before, and they've already delivered on their promises so far.

1461
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,320
And we have their community manager in our room right now here to interact with the community,

1462
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:46,200
which, in my opinion, is just crushing it because it's an open room.

1463
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,640
Anybody can say anything and he's right there, right?

1464
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,480
There's no buffer and that takes guts and that takes commitment.

1465
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:58,520
And I was willing to roll out the red carpet for Greg and have a nice civil chat.

1466
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:02,760
You guys know me, you know how my interview style is, you know how I roll, but that's

1467
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,960
not where it ended up.

1468
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,480
So you make your own decisions out there.

1469
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:06,440
You all have to do that.

1470
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,720
But I don't think we'll be deploying any Rocky Linux servers.

1471
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,920
I find it very disappointing.

1472
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,080
Coming on the show would have just been a great opportunity.

1473
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,080
You know, it could have been a great opportunity to say, yeah, some heads were butting early

1474
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,240
on, but, you know, we're moving on now.

1475
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,640
But it didn't happen.

1476
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,920
It is what it is.

1477
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,080
I agree with Johnny Hughes.

1478
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,320
He's a CentOS project developer and a board member.

1479
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,000
He says, go with all the Linux.

1480
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,600
I agree with Johnny.

1481
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:33,720
Well, with that out of the way, we better clean up in here.

1482
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:40,120
So I heard there was quite the virtual lug this Sunday.

1483
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,000
Yeah, of course, there's always a great virtual lug on Sunday.

1484
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,600
It's just that we don't always make it.

1485
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,400
But you did.

1486
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,520
Of course I did.

1487
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,760
Well, we we got land done early.

1488
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,240
So I had a little spot of free time on Sunday after working out some issues.

1489
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:57,960
You know, I was using a different system where I'd compiled pipe wire from source.

1490
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:03,640
And I also had mumble installed from a flat pack and took a little bit to get going.

1491
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,040
That doesn't have to be your experience, though.

1492
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,960
You just get mumble set up and don't mess around with your own custom audio setup.

1493
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,440
You'll be fine.

1494
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:10,920
It's easy.

1495
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,800
And there's a lot of folks there, like like Minimac, who are ready to help you out, which

1496
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,440
is amazing.

1497
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,240
That's true.

1498
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,280
And then your mumble is all good to go in case you can make it on a Tuesday.

1499
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:20,760
Right.

1500
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:24,120
You know, playing hooky, you want to come hang out with your Linux buddies on a Tuesday.

1501
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,240
We do this show every Tuesday that we can until we're on the road.

1502
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,280
And then maybe it gets weird.

1503
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,000
I don't know.

1504
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,280
But we'd love to get your feedback.

1505
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,920
We're going to try to integrate that more while we're on the road and just get some

1506
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,120
conversations going.

1507
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,280
So Linux unplugged dot com slash contact.

1508
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,440
It's open feedback season for the rest of the summer.

1509
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,680
Go fill our inbox.

1510
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:45,000
Also, our telegram group has had some really great conversations going recently.

1511
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,040
Like I've been popping in there and having some great chats.

1512
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,000
So check that out.

1513
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,160
The conversation is going all the time at Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash telegram.

1514
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,920
And then last but not least, got to plug that meetup page because those meetups are getting

1515
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:57,420
close.

1516
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:58,840
And I want you to remember it.

1517
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,280
So I say it multiple times now.

1518
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,840
Meetup dot com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

1519
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,640
All right.

1520
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,880
We have a pick that's kind of special.

1521
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,280
It's it's like Wireshark, but not.

1522
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:15,000
Yeah, it's called hot wire and it's a GTK application.

1523
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,640
Yeah, that's right.

1524
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,160
No electron here.

1525
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:21,880
Now, it does leverage a lot of the Wireshark and T-Shark infrastructure to capture traffic

1526
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,720
and explore the contents.

1527
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,880
But it's really aimed at displaying a subset of that data and a subset of all the crazy

1528
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,400
protocols that Wireshark supports in a focused way.

1529
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:33,160
It looks really, really good.

1530
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,240
But there's one thing missing, Wes.

1531
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,560
Can you can you spice it up a little bit for me?

1532
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:47,160
It's written in rest.

1533
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,560
And there's one aspect of this that is super cool.

1534
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:54,680
Hot wire can open TCP dump files and record traffic through a FIFO file, which basically

1535
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:58,920
means you don't need escalated or special root privileges to monitor traffic.

1536
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,760
It's just smart to think about this because the way I got it installed was the flat pack

1537
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,880
and, you know, in modern sort of more secure Linux apps, you might not want to give some

1538
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:09,560
random app pseudo access to capture from your wireless card or something.

1539
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:13,240
And so this is sort of set up in a way where you can go run that dump on your own and pipe

1540
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:13,800
it in.

1541
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,920
Wow, a network capture tool via flat pack.

1542
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,160
That is that is the new era right there.

1543
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:23,880
It's early days, currently only supports the Postgres, HTTP, and HTTP2.

1544
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,200
But if you're working with one of those, it could be pretty handy.

1545
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,160
Well, I'm out.

1546
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:27,640
I'm out.

1547
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:32,600
Instead, I'm going to recommend RustScan.

1548
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:36,280
Yes, another RustScan.

1549
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:36,920
It's too much.

1550
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:39,960
The whole world is getting rusty.

1551
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,960
And it's this one.

1552
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,320
This one is modern.

1553
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:43,880
It's fast.

1554
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:49,080
And this one has the exciting tagline that it can scan all 65,000 ports in three seconds,

1555
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,920
which is really what got my attention.

1556
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,000
I was all in when I saw that.

1557
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,800
And of course, it's in the AUR.

1558
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,960
It's also in homebrew.

1559
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:01,640
And as Wes will tell you, it's also available via Docker.

1560
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,760
That's right.

1561
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,280
A little secret tip here.

1562
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,800
If you try it out, you'll see it throws a little shade at nmap too once it runs.

1563
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,440
So that's fun.

1564
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,640
Oh, man.

1565
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:15,240
Well, I mean, 65,000 ports in three seconds is actually legitimately impressive.

1566
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,720
I can't even really conceive how it's technically possible.

1567
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:19,240
All the CPU cores, I suppose.

1568
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:21,800
It's the power of Rust.

1569
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,440
Yeah, I guess.

1570
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,640
The Rust can do anything.

1571
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,600
If you're into the Twitter thing, you can follow this here show.

1572
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,960
We are at Linux Unplugged.

1573
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,880
The network is at Jupyter Syctl.

1574
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,920
It's a great way to get show announcements or news or send us some feedback.

1575
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,040
You can do it that way.

1576
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,480
Of course, we have that contact page.

1577
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,520
That's the canonical way.

1578
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,080
No, not that canonical, but like the official way.

1579
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,960
linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1580
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:45,880
Now, there's only two more episodes left in studio.

1581
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,160
So do try to join us live.

1582
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,840
Make it a Linux Tuesday.

1583
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,560
See you next week.

1584
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,440
Same bat time, same bat station.

1585
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:52,920
That's right.

1586
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:57,320
That's noon Pacific, 3pm Eastern over at jblive.tv.

1587
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,680
jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for your local time.

1588
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:04,440
If you want a full breakdown of the Steam Deck announcement and our analysis,

1589
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,200
check out Linux Action News.

1590
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:10,040
There's a lot packed in there, including some very interesting news that

1591
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,520
we just don't have time in the Unplugged program.

1592
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,520
But I wish we did.

1593
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:15,160
I wish we did.

1594
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,040
Maybe one day.

1595
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,120
Maybe we'll do three unplugs a week one day.

1596
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,200
Only you can make it possible by becoming a member.

1597
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,480
unpluggedcore.com, three episodes a week.

1598
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,760
Trust me, you don't want that.

1599
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,280
No, I don't want that.

1600
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,400
No, thanks for joining us.

1601
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:56,120
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1602
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:09,000
You know, I think something that doesn't get talked about with the whole

1603
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:15,000
AMA Linux and Rocky Linux and CentOS Stream is this market that these distributions serve

1604
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,760
is fundamental to how Linux makes money.

1605
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,600
Like the desktop isn't what gets a lot of contributions to Linux.

1606
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,320
I mean, absolutely does.

1607
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:26,760
But when you look at like big money contributions and percentages,

1608
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:31,080
it's companies contributing to Linux to get their hardware enablement support

1609
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:34,840
or to get something working for their device stack that's in the enterprise.

1610
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:37,320
It's so server focused.

1611
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,640
It's like the desktop market doesn't even exist, right?

1612
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,640
When you look at how Linux makes money.

1613
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,640
And so when you take these distributions like Rocky and Alma,

1614
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:50,040
they are serving a market that screws with how Linux can survive.

1615
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,960
And so if one of them goes sideways, and I just think, you know,

1616
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,880
I look at cloud Linux was around for 10 years, right?

1617
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:59,640
But if one of these go sideways, the damage to Linux is reputation.

1618
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:04,120
These free distros, these quote unquote free distros, you just can't trust them.

1619
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:07,480
You could see how a narrative like that could take off like wildfire.

1620
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:12,200
So the actual like what's at stake here is fairly significant when you consider

1621
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:15,880
this is what makes Linux relevant in the marketplace is this category

1622
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,800
that these distributions are serving.

1623
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:22,600
And people have just a few months left to start making their decisions, right?

1624
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,400
So that's why when you say, oh, we don't want to make a comparison.

1625
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,160
It's just ludicrous.

1626
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,840
People are making the, yeah, you may not want to, but people are and sort of have to.

1627
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,120
It's vital right now.

1628
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,040
And the stakes couldn't be higher.

1629
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,080
So like, we really got to figure this out because

1630
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:40,680
we could tank Linux's reputation in this category.

1631
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,640
I wonder how many folks are testing out multiple, you know, sort of.

1632
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:47,480
I'd hope that at least at first, especially that the delta would be not too large.

1633
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,280
So even if you did sort of go with one, try it all out, you know,

1634
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,480
if you needed to, if there was some strange bug or something you could pivot.

1635
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,160
But what are the differences going to be?

1636
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:58,040
Yeah, hopefully it's hard to screw up in a meaningful way.

1637
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:01,720
You spin them up and you can hardly even tell really once you pass the login screen.

1638
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,880
I mean, you can hardly even tell.

1639
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,560
And I think that's a burden load that a lot of people are going to look at and go,

1640
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,400
well, let's just go a stream.

1641
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,720
I mean, I think a lot of people are going to consider that.

1642
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,600
I would.

1643
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:14,440
That's what I would want.

1644
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,520
Yeah, I mean, it's coming, you know.

1645
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,920
Before we get out of here, I didn't want to talk about it in the main show,

1646
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,080
but I do want to bring awareness to this problem.

1647
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:25,640
The head of strategy for the Muse group seems to be threatening a developer

1648
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:30,040
of one of the Audacity forks with thinly veiled threats about contacting

1649
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,000
the government and getting his citizenship revoked and things like that.

1650
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,880
Not Audacity, the fork of what's the other program?

1651
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,160
Oh, MuseScore, MuseScore, thank you, thank you, right.

1652
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,600
It's a fork of MuseScore, thank you.

1653
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,400
Yeah, so that was LibraScore, I think is what it's called.

1654
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:50,680
I forget what it's, I forget the name of it, but yeah, I was horrified.

1655
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,960
When I saw that, when I saw that, it's like he tried to cover it up

1656
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,720
by editing the message, but he clearly forgot that GitHub actually

1657
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,240
archives all versions of comments in in threads.

1658
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:06,760
So the original one was still there and it was absolutely horrific because

1659
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:13,480
he's basically blackmailing the dude, like without actually going out right

1660
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,360
and saying it, it basically was it was bad.

1661
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:22,040
That was some serious mafia shit, man, to go after someone like that

1662
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:28,520
and basically threaten him with like deportation back to China, that was not nice.

1663
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,800
A public forum, no less.

1664
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,720
Yeah, on GitHub, on GitHub.

1665
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,680
One thing is a threatening email or something, but like, geez.

1666
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:39,480
But also like implied that, you know, we know that if this happens,

1667
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,160
you won't be long for this world.

1668
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:47,880
It's like, what kind of crap is going on here?
