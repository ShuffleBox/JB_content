WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
See valve has a new VR headset

00:03.360 --> 00:08.180
Yeah, yeah your VR is dead it was never living ouch

00:09.240 --> 00:17.180
All right. Well, I can use it today when we have a VR headset and my wife is sat there like in some

00:17.360 --> 00:25.840
Stupid jewel popping game or something in 3d on the sofa and we never speak to each other anymore because she's got this fucking stupid

00:25.840 --> 00:30.600
Or maybe it's the other way around and it's me. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know though

00:30.600 --> 00:33.560
I felt that way too, and then I got an oculus and I changed my mind

00:34.440 --> 00:40.200
Yeah, the thing about VR is I can remember going down to Piccadilly Circus in like

00:41.040 --> 00:42.280
1992

00:42.280 --> 00:46.080
1993 when I was a student and put in this, you know

00:46.360 --> 00:53.740
15 pound headset on my head and paying five quid to romp around in some line art

00:53.740 --> 01:00.880
3d world and it was kind of interesting and kind of impressive for the day, but ultimately

01:01.340 --> 01:05.900
Yeah, just something. Yeah, but now you could have one in your house, right?

01:05.900 --> 01:12.740
So that's one big difference is the opportunity cost of you playing with it is you picking it up on your head, right? Yeah, the the

01:14.020 --> 01:17.940
Hardware will be lighter and will fit your head better despite you having a massive

01:17.940 --> 01:22.420
All true all true gonna torpedo torpedo you in however keep going

01:22.420 --> 01:29.120
Go and keep making a big target for yourself. There is also the fact that you can now get immersed in games

01:29.660 --> 01:35.140
Like well, let's pick an easy target Minecraft where you can spend six hours

01:35.140 --> 01:41.940
Yeah, Minecraft. Yeah, big targets getting bigger and bigger. It's easier to shoot. Go on then go on then shoot me down

01:41.940 --> 01:43.940
What's wrong with sitting there playing?

01:43.940 --> 01:50.020
Minecraft is the same the VR today is sexier hardware and sexier graphics

01:50.020 --> 01:56.340
But it's the same shit. We were doing 20 years ago. It hasn't actually moved the needle, right?

01:56.340 --> 02:02.820
But it's just the same stuff 20 years ago. It was it was the the Nintendo Virtual Boy. That was no no

02:03.860 --> 02:08.060
I'm talking about the stuff you could you could stroll into and use but but think about it

02:08.060 --> 02:12.220
What about VR now the graphics are better the headsets are lighter

02:12.220 --> 02:14.740
The resolution is higher, but it's the same

02:14.740 --> 02:20.860
It's the same experience that they're trying to sell us that we were we were looking at 20 years ago. Just a bit better

02:21.420 --> 02:23.420
Right. They were interesting

02:23.980 --> 02:27.020
They were they were way ahead of their time back then well

02:27.780 --> 02:32.580
Why aren't we now? Why aren't we thinking? Why aren't we 20 years ahead of the time now?

02:32.580 --> 02:35.820
Why aren't we why haven't we got things that are pushing the envelope?

02:35.820 --> 02:42.460
They're a bit shit and a bit rubbish because we haven't got the hardware and the equipment to to deliver

02:42.460 --> 02:44.260
Okay, I want to do 20 years from now

02:44.260 --> 02:47.260
I'm just improving on what we were already doing 20 years ago

02:47.260 --> 02:51.060
They're rubbish by the by the end of next year by the end of 2016

02:51.060 --> 02:55.420
So we'll get the first gen ones out first gen being oculus second gen being valve

02:55.460 --> 02:57.460
We'll get these ones out of the way this year

02:58.300 --> 03:02.140
Next year, you'll go on Alibaba and be able to buy cheap

03:02.140 --> 03:05.540
commodity VR headsets super cheap

03:05.540 --> 03:09.600
I mean, come on and what are you gonna what are you gonna do with it?

03:09.940 --> 03:14.920
Well by then there'll be shitloads of games in Steam because valve are bringing them to market

03:15.700 --> 03:21.940
Yeah, a shitload of shit games is what I envisage is what it's gonna look like 18 months from now, right?

03:21.940 --> 03:24.840
but I can sit on my sofa and I can be immersed in a game and

03:25.380 --> 03:29.420
My kids can be watching TV. Well, whatever game it could be Minecraft

03:29.420 --> 03:33.560
You can't say that shit 20 million nine-year-olds can't be wrong

03:34.780 --> 03:40.240
When I've played it, I'll let you know whether I think it's shit or not. Oh, you haven't played it yet. No, never

03:43.540 --> 03:48.180
Apparently it's like Lego, but I actually do Lego in real life

03:48.180 --> 03:52.840
Your fingers hurt and my I've been playing Minecraft all day and my fingers don't have well, okay

03:52.840 --> 03:57.140
so I've spent the weekend helping to build a 20 foot tall rocket out of

03:57.140 --> 04:00.340
Three hundred and thirty thousand pieces of Lego, right?

04:01.740 --> 04:03.740
Compete with that

04:04.540 --> 04:09.140
Shit well what I've built millions of people could come by and and

04:09.460 --> 04:16.180
See my server and drop by and help and contribute yours is a photo on a on a dead social network Google Plus

04:16.180 --> 04:18.940
That nobody's ever gonna see yeah

04:18.940 --> 04:25.840
But then again the whole of North Hampshire community is involved engaged in building this absolutely epic rocket out of Lego

04:25.840 --> 04:33.320
Which right is the real world and it's real 3d and everything and the definition you wouldn't believe the quality of the graphics

04:33.320 --> 04:36.440
It's like it might be analog, but it's really good

04:37.080 --> 04:40.200
Can you check? Can you change the theme? Can you change the skin? Yeah

04:40.200 --> 04:42.880
Yeah, we're doing at the moment in red white and blue

04:42.880 --> 04:46.080
But you know you could do it in just black and white or you could do it in puce

04:46.680 --> 04:51.880
Cyan and yellow if you really wanted to but you'd have to rebuild it. You couldn't just press a button and make it

04:51.880 --> 04:56.400
Yeah, yeah, but think about have you ever imagined what it would be like to tip over a 20-foot?

04:57.280 --> 05:01.800
Rocket out of three hundred thirty thousand bricks of Lego. I mean just imagine

05:02.480 --> 05:05.440
Have you ever wondered what it's like to blow up a house with TNT? I mean

05:07.320 --> 05:12.780
No, that hasn't crossed my mind this happens you're not as deranged as I thought you were with me you really are

05:13.880 --> 05:15.580
I'm disappointed

05:15.580 --> 05:17.580
What about the Microsoft?

05:17.580 --> 05:23.340
Microsoft hollow lens where they're gonna overlay over your environment now come on that is kind of useful because

05:23.620 --> 05:27.000
You just like take something simple like you're taking a part of PC

05:27.000 --> 05:32.580
And you open up the case and maybe all of a sudden you could have outlays of like here's all the tickets ever assigned

05:32.580 --> 05:38.020
To this PC. Here's your company inventory information about it this video cards stuff like that hollow lens

05:38.020 --> 05:44.460
Maybe that's real. So so what you're describing there is augmented reality. I believe that's the buzzword. Is that right? Yeah

05:44.460 --> 05:49.340
Wow, you sound like an old man Wimpy. Hey, well, I'm an old man. I've got gray hairs and everything

05:49.340 --> 05:54.780
Um, I think augmented reality has got far more mileage than VR, frankly

05:55.620 --> 05:59.500
Now, you know see in Microsoft's world. They also have the ability

05:59.500 --> 06:04.300
So I think in anything that's gonna be successful today. You got to have a whole ecosystem

06:04.300 --> 06:08.700
You got to have like you got to have app partners like Netflix. You're gonna have to have they have Skype

06:08.700 --> 06:14.180
They have an app store that universal applications that people write for Windows 10 and the phones also work on hollow lens

06:14.180 --> 06:15.740
somehow, I

06:15.740 --> 06:18.260
Mean so they even have the ecosystem to back it up. I

06:19.900 --> 06:22.420
Think when it comes to augmented reality

06:23.860 --> 06:26.100
It's easier to do as well

06:27.380 --> 06:31.300
honestly, so not the full integrated thing, but actually just the

06:32.540 --> 06:39.700
Basic level of you know, you have something that identifies the product that you're looking at in a in a in a store

06:39.700 --> 06:45.900
Yeah, speaking of minecraft. Here's here's minecraft in your living room using hollow lens. I don't think this is ever gonna happen

06:46.500 --> 06:51.660
this is Microsoft isn't Microsoft has never been able to pull this kind of thing off and

06:52.740 --> 06:58.300
It's just like this isn't really gonna happen. This is a surface table all over again. Yeah, it's yes

06:58.460 --> 07:03.280
This is not gonna happen. It's the surface exactly. This is the table. This is the table all over again

07:03.940 --> 07:05.140
or

07:05.140 --> 07:10.380
there's gonna be the three leading ones like as I said Microsoft valve and

07:11.100 --> 07:13.340
Facebook and then there'll be loads of

07:14.220 --> 07:18.220
Cheap and cheerful knockoff Chinese ones next year. I guarantee

07:19.780 --> 07:21.780
Sources where in this

07:21.820 --> 07:23.580
yeah, and

07:23.580 --> 07:29.100
What are you actually going to do with these things? That's that's the other thing. I just don't see what the purpose is

07:29.100 --> 07:35.940
so so I imagine that I would be able to see a 3d render of Chris's studio and

07:36.140 --> 07:42.100
I'm sat here at home with my goggles on while I'm listening to him doing

07:44.300 --> 07:51.220
You're describing the Internet when it was sold to us in 1994 right now, that's true. This is a Unix system

07:51.220 --> 07:59.540
I know this, you know, it is exactly it's 3d and I want 3d and I want to be able to while we were working around this

07:59.620 --> 08:06.740
Virtual cyberspace back in the mid 90s. I had some great demos, didn't they remember the Sun Microsystem demos where you have doing up?

08:06.740 --> 08:08.940
Oh, man, you know what Chris?

08:08.940 --> 08:14.180
I actually worked at Sun Microsystem and helped create some of those demos back in the day. Those are good

08:14.180 --> 08:17.940
I wanted to live in that virtual world. I would never have to leave my house. I

08:17.940 --> 08:23.340
Go to the mall and and at malls online stores weren't websites

08:23.340 --> 08:27.180
They were represented as virtual reality first-person stores

08:27.180 --> 08:35.280
You're gonna want and think how how out of date was that because look back what people were trying to create was a 3d

08:36.100 --> 08:40.780
Representation of a shop that you would walk around in the same

08:41.220 --> 08:45.220
Inefficient manner that you walk around a real shop. Yeah to do your shopping

08:45.220 --> 08:51.620
It was so backward thinking a second life game is as close to that as possible. Yeah

08:53.540 --> 08:57.020
Yeah, well, it's how we approach everything when we bring it into a new era

08:57.740 --> 09:02.540
You know we we we we kind of put like all our the old way of looking at things out

09:02.540 --> 09:05.740
And then as new people come along they they shake that stuff

09:05.740 --> 09:10.300
Yeah, the two industries that are gonna push this are the same two industries that you're gonna push this

09:10.300 --> 09:15.980
Oh, come on, baby. Go and get your credit card out. Tell it. Tell us what it is. You subscribe to the two things that you

09:15.980 --> 09:17.540
buy are

09:17.540 --> 09:19.780
Games and porn. Yeah, we go

09:27.300 --> 09:32.460
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that honestly still feeling a little nostalgic

09:32.820 --> 09:37.840
My name is Chris and my name is Matt and Matt. So we had last week

09:37.840 --> 09:43.260
We had a show that was pre done for us because we were taking some time off during the beard apocalypse and during the scale

09:43.260 --> 09:48.040
Coverage which we're gonna do a little bit more of in today's episode couple of interviews

09:49.460 --> 09:54.860
One that I put back in the rotation based on a request from an audience member because it's for a really great cause and

09:55.140 --> 09:57.140
One that really blew me away

09:57.140 --> 10:02.420
I didn't expect to ever feature an interview on the Linux action show or Linux unplugged from this company

10:02.420 --> 10:08.260
but Noah got it and we found out they use a lot more Linux than we expected and then also there's a

10:08.660 --> 10:14.020
Really in-depth discussion with an Ubuntu representative at one of at the Ubuntu booth

10:14.540 --> 10:17.340
so we'll play those coming up in the show a little bit and then also

10:19.220 --> 10:20.580
After all of that

10:20.580 --> 10:26.020
I'm gonna pick wimpy's ear on all of the developments going on with the Ubuntu Mate project

10:26.500 --> 10:31.500
Some of their news and also just maybe any mate updates in general and some other stuff

10:31.500 --> 10:33.500
So Matt, we got a lot of ground to cover

10:33.700 --> 10:37.860
Good stuff. We got you know, we got to get down to business. So I thought first there's just a couple of like

10:38.660 --> 10:44.540
Speaking of being nostalgic. There's just a couple things. I wanted to touch on the first one before we get into the main show. I

10:45.660 --> 10:47.660
Don't know if this makes you feel old or what?

10:48.700 --> 10:50.700
on this day in

10:50.980 --> 10:57.700
1999 March 3rd 2015. Yeah, it's March guys. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes. It's March

10:57.700 --> 11:02.400
Gnome 1.0 was released on March 3rd 1999

11:03.140 --> 11:05.820
Slash that headline goes as follows or blurb

11:06.420 --> 11:08.220
Gnome 1.0 is now released for download

11:08.220 --> 11:13.020
Please pursue the pursue the press release and then download it via a convenient FTP mirror

11:13.020 --> 11:16.860
And then they also say and I forgot about this extension and then they have this update

11:17.260 --> 11:24.700
The next the next day forgot to plug my own program if you've installed no more want scrolling slash dot headlines in your panel

11:24.700 --> 11:28.500
Check under applets amusement slash app Wow

11:31.740 --> 11:37.580
You know why I was reading them in between that, you know, cuz I had to stock my compound up for Y2K and all that

11:37.580 --> 11:42.340
So I was you know busy with all that sort of stuff. That was a bit that year was the busy year

11:43.140 --> 11:46.700
Alright, so let's bring in the mumble room time appropriate greetings mumble room

11:46.700 --> 11:53.340
Good evening anybody in here old enough to actually remember the release of Gnome 1.0. I'm not gonna say

11:59.340 --> 12:01.340
Yeah, I am old enough and also

12:01.900 --> 12:09.220
Dare I say it that it was much easier to compile KDE back then so I was a KDE user back back in those days

12:09.220 --> 12:11.220
Oh

12:11.220 --> 12:18.020
Good times good times, you know what it makes me think of it makes me it makes me think of KD as well because that

12:18.020 --> 12:22.740
Was actually a hardcore KD user back and back in those days. So it actually made me think of the same thing

12:23.540 --> 12:29.980
Alright, so in the pre show which if you're listening on the download will probably be featured it in the post show

12:29.980 --> 12:35.900
How about that for a little time travel? We got into a big discussion about smart watches and wearables

12:35.900 --> 12:41.700
It's the big thing right now, you know next week's the Apple watch event and a pebbles got their Kickstarter going right now

12:41.700 --> 12:42.900
which I

12:42.900 --> 12:45.800
Think I'm totally gonna back and Poby just back during the pre show

12:46.700 --> 12:49.800
But nobody's been talking about what the Firefox OS is doing watch wise

12:49.980 --> 12:56.140
So I found this article over at Linux gizmo's pocket watch a pocket watch that runs Firefox OS

12:56.420 --> 13:01.340
Screw putting on your wrist check this thing out with its slick sexy wood style. It's got a

13:02.460 --> 13:04.460
Japanese style wood that's beautiful

13:04.460 --> 13:09.940
and it has a camera built-in right it's got a metal ring around the front and

13:10.500 --> 13:13.100
You can hold it kind of like a smooth pebble

13:13.660 --> 13:18.980
It's a dish shape fits in the palm of one's hand and the round screen is fairly small

13:19.340 --> 13:24.620
But if you it appears to be probably larger than most Android wear devices like the moto 360

13:26.220 --> 13:31.120
Look at that. What do you know? I don't know, you know, I'm I almost want to say I'm skeptical

13:31.120 --> 13:33.860
No, it actually sounds pretty cool. It does sound pretty cool

13:33.860 --> 13:37.980
I'd had it's one of the things I'd want to actually try before I could really give a proper judgment

13:37.980 --> 13:41.860
But it sounds different sounds pretty cool. So yeah, I don't know

13:42.660 --> 13:45.500
Little skeptical. Yeah, I am very skeptical

13:47.060 --> 13:48.420
Just

13:48.420 --> 13:51.120
Does everybody have to be doing this really?

13:51.220 --> 13:56.420
Like can we all do we all have to be doing this can can some of us just focus on one thing and just do

13:56.420 --> 13:57.560
One thing right?

13:57.560 --> 14:03.900
That would be nice. Don't ask poppy because apparently Ubuntu can't oh, yeah, I

14:04.900 --> 14:08.260
Get you know, your guys's pre-show got me all riled up. I'm all fired up now

14:08.780 --> 14:12.380
It's like they were really going at it now. I'm all I'm all ready to go

14:13.380 --> 14:16.820
Which kind of while I'm at it, I'll take it. I'll take it just a quick shot at wimpy

14:17.100 --> 14:22.880
Just a real quick one wimpy now. I got to give a thumbs down to the Amazon fire TV thumbs down

14:22.880 --> 14:27.660
I I mean I wanted to love a Linux running rig like like no other but in my

14:27.980 --> 14:31.740
Estimation for the money the Roku 3 is the much better by it is

14:32.260 --> 14:36.700
so I heard you I heard you hint that you are not impressed with my

14:37.820 --> 14:40.220
recommendation on on unplugged I think

14:41.100 --> 14:48.980
Yeah, maybe it's a geographical thing because I think you're more spoiled in the US with online

14:48.980 --> 14:55.980
You know media services I give you a basic here's a basic bar. There's first of all, there's no Jupiter broadcasts now, right?

14:55.980 --> 15:00.220
No, there's that there's a dedicated Roku app now you could sideload it now

15:00.220 --> 15:04.780
See a big part of my complaints are if you sideload most the apps it solves most of the problems

15:04.780 --> 15:11.180
But I just find the Amazon app selection to be extremely limited. It's like I have three apps maybe that I like four apps

15:11.180 --> 15:15.700
Yeah, that's why I sideload almost everything. I have a really great GUI a sideloader

15:15.700 --> 15:21.780
Oh, I think so. I think this is where the difference is. So you have to sideload things to get what you would consider

15:22.460 --> 15:24.140
normal service

15:24.140 --> 15:30.060
Whereas in the UK what we would consider a complete service is available

15:30.580 --> 15:35.100
Through the App Store, which is where it differs from the Roku. Hmm

15:35.660 --> 15:41.220
Well, I also feel like the Roku kind of has a much more freewheeling open community where anyone can contribute

15:41.220 --> 15:45.260
With us certainly true. Yeah, and I so I like that aspect of it a bit, too. I

15:46.100 --> 15:49.140
Don't know. I just I mean it's they're both at the end of the day

15:49.140 --> 15:52.340
Ding-ding. I'm trying to try not to say that anymore, but the end of the day

15:52.820 --> 15:57.140
They both will play my Plex files. They've you both can you can sideload Kodi on them

15:57.860 --> 16:01.620
All right on about the Roku, but you can sideload Kodi on the fire. So that's good

16:01.620 --> 16:03.460
I mean that gives it a major plus in my book

16:03.460 --> 16:06.020
But the thing I really like about the Roku is it does feel

16:06.020 --> 16:10.460
It's a little bit faster to get just to what I want. There's less stuff. They're trying to sell me like all the prime stuff

16:10.460 --> 16:12.700
It's all up in my face and then also

16:14.100 --> 16:16.420
That there's a Jupiter broadcasting app, which is really nice. I

16:17.060 --> 16:22.940
Would go so far because I have both I have the stick for for the Amazon situation, but it's the same same experience

16:22.940 --> 16:27.500
I do feel like Amazon's experience is very much like a gigantic ad being blasted in my face the entire time

16:28.340 --> 16:31.940
No question about that sideloading just to get it to work even remotely usable

16:31.940 --> 16:36.660
That being said when you actually get into something like Plex or whatnot Roku feels painfully dated

16:37.460 --> 16:42.660
Painfully dated. I mean just really bad. Although that is changing. It's actually got a new thing coming out

16:42.660 --> 16:47.860
Yeah, they do there is a Plex update coming for the Roku but still not gonna be as nice as the fire then and you

16:47.860 --> 16:54.300
Know the the Netflix app on the fire TV supports multiple profiles, but on the Roku it doesn't

16:54.300 --> 16:57.460
No, it does now it doesn't. Yeah, it doesn't know I'm not in the UK. It doesn't

16:57.460 --> 17:00.260
Oh, okay, so it doesn't work on the Roku

17:00.260 --> 17:05.940
Yeah, so anyways working on a thing so maybe you know, we're playing a bit of catch-up enough

17:05.940 --> 17:10.980
Yeah, I would say VPN is your friend. I think if you live in a region where you're not services that we have there

17:10.980 --> 17:17.620
Yeah, maybe I mean I you might even get different firmwares for all I know that she has different may even different menus

17:19.180 --> 17:24.180
Either way, I that was just my roundabout way to say that they're both good devices

17:24.180 --> 17:28.660
They both run Linux, of course, but I wasn't quite sure that I was going to be able to do that

17:28.660 --> 17:34.460
But I wasn't crazy impressed with with fire TV. I'm not crazy impressed with Firefox's attempt here

17:34.460 --> 17:37.700
I mean, I'm totally willing to give it a go. Maybe it's not even the Mozilla project

17:37.700 --> 17:40.380
So I literally just found this before the show just to talk to you guys about it

17:40.900 --> 17:45.220
I kind of like if I if I step back and thought about it being possible

17:45.220 --> 17:47.980
You know, you could think about maybe putting a GSM connection in this thing

17:48.380 --> 17:51.460
You know if there was a way if there was a way to really kind of

17:52.180 --> 17:55.860
Make this thing connected. So it was a true true legitimate computer

17:55.860 --> 17:59.220
That would be that would be kind of interesting then you might have my attention

17:59.900 --> 18:05.260
But I just I don't think you could put the horsepower or the battery life in it to pull it off yet

18:05.980 --> 18:08.980
Maybe one day maybe you got to start somewhere right guys

18:10.620 --> 18:13.940
Speaking of starting somewhere. I'll tell you where I'm gonna start right now

18:13.940 --> 18:17.380
Let's start with our first sponsor this week and that's ting

18:17.380 --> 18:23.040
Now this is a great time to move to ting because ting is rolling out the open beta to their GSM network

18:23.040 --> 18:28.800
And you remember our buddy chase from how to Linux and he's actually been on Linux unplugged a couple times

18:30.260 --> 18:35.220
He is setting up a pretty sophisticated security system and he said, you know what, you know

18:35.220 --> 18:38.160
It's something you've never mentioned but a great use for ting is

18:38.740 --> 18:42.380
Remote systems that need internet connectivity, but don't use a lot of data

18:42.380 --> 18:46.940
They send off reports or they do a nightly upload like once a night or a weekly thing

18:46.940 --> 18:51.180
He said tings perfect for this. He says I looked around I said I could buy some prepaid things

18:51.180 --> 18:56.860
I had different routes to go but tings flat six dollars a month then just pay for what you use and I don't need any

18:56.940 --> 18:58.060
voicemail and

18:58.060 --> 19:02.940
He has the thing you can send the SMS text messages and then do image uploads and video uploads

19:02.940 --> 19:06.700
And so he just when it needs to send a text message a couple of times a month

19:06.780 --> 19:10.860
He pays for the text and it's like nothing. It's like nothing

19:10.860 --> 19:15.220
It's so great and there's no early termination fee if he wants to turn it off because there's no contract

19:15.220 --> 19:16.660
It's a really cool service

19:16.660 --> 19:23.640
And in fact, if you go over to linux.ting.com, you can take advantage of the Linux unplugged discount and support the Linux unplugged podcast

19:23.640 --> 19:28.580
It's a great way to say hey, I heard about this on unplugged. I really appreciate you helping them stay on the air

19:28.580 --> 19:34.620
So go to linux.ting.com like $25 off your first device and then you can go grab like this ting GSM card

19:34.620 --> 19:38.100
And this is cool because it's a pre-cut to multiple different sizes

19:38.460 --> 19:42.720
So you grab this one thing and it fits in your various different devices

19:42.720 --> 19:48.680
Ting also just added the moto G for $91. This is unbelievable. This is

19:50.080 --> 19:55.320
Unbelievable phone for $91 and you get it with no contract. It's unlocked. It's yours $6

19:55.440 --> 19:58.920
Go to linux.ting.com. Here's a here's another ride you could go

20:00.000 --> 20:05.320
These novatel mi-fi devices. This is like internet in your pocket $6 for this mi-fi hotspot

20:05.800 --> 20:08.840
It's tri-band LTE you get the signal coverage right there

20:08.920 --> 20:10.260
This is a great way to go

20:10.260 --> 20:14.760
And then of course if you want to spend just a little bit more just a few dollars more you can get the net gear

20:14.760 --> 20:16.160
with the LED

20:16.160 --> 20:19.320
Screen and it gives you the touch interface and all that kind of stuff

20:19.320 --> 20:21.400
They've also now got the Kyocera hydrovibe

20:21.400 --> 20:29.900
Which is a slick phone as well as the LG g3 the Nexus 5 the iPhones the Galaxy tab and the iPhone 6 and 6

20:30.360 --> 20:31.860
plus

20:31.860 --> 20:36.360
Unlocked and all yours including the HTC m8 go to linux.ting.com

20:36.360 --> 20:41.640
Linux.ting.com try out their savings calculator give it a try see what you might save you'd be surprised

20:41.640 --> 20:45.300
But your actual usage in there and then also check out the ting blog like right now

20:45.300 --> 20:49.400
They're talking about like their customer service demands right now with their new GSM rollout, but also

20:50.480 --> 20:55.720
Some changes in the sprint network, which they're dealing with and updating customers on their blog

20:55.720 --> 20:58.480
And you can read more about it ting is really great about updating their customers

20:58.480 --> 21:02.580
It's a great way to go because they have an incredible control panel no hold customer service

21:02.580 --> 21:05.160
You only pay for what you use unlocked phones

21:05.160 --> 21:10.520
I mean, it's just like it's just it's a really great way to go and like one of the things that I constantly

21:11.040 --> 21:16.000
Constantly mentioned because it's just so damn useful is every phone just has hotspot and tethering

21:16.000 --> 21:20.240
It's just part of the plan like it's just not like they don't try to trick you into some sort of gimmicky plan where you

21:20.240 --> 21:25.680
Have to pay more you just turn it on and have it and I think about with the T with the GSM network now

21:25.680 --> 21:30.880
Coming online for those of us who have devices like you know many of the multi-sim devices

21:30.880 --> 21:35.360
But the Nexus 5 is one of them you now have the advantage to switch between

21:35.800 --> 21:41.160
GSM or CDMA now you're gonna have to figure out how to do that and make sure you can manage in the tin control panel

21:41.160 --> 21:43.160
And they're gonna have more information on that soon

21:44.000 --> 21:50.040
You can switch between whichever area has the better service and then turn on the hotspot or tethering and you're just paying for the data usage

21:50.760 --> 21:52.400
That's pretty slick

21:52.400 --> 21:57.920
Linux dot ting comm go check them out and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program

21:57.920 --> 22:00.680
I hope you guys are kicking butt keep up the good work

22:01.400 --> 22:03.360
Okay, so then there was one more thing

22:03.360 --> 22:07.240
I wanted to discuss with the with the panel because there's a there's a piece of software

22:07.240 --> 22:09.420
We've talked a lot about on the Linux unplugged show

22:09.420 --> 22:15.200
And I think a fair amount of us on the show have used it for at least different periods of time if not extensively

22:15.840 --> 22:17.840
bit torrent sync

22:18.120 --> 22:20.120
new version announced today

22:20.600 --> 22:24.120
They're rolling out bit torrent sync Pro or just call it sync if you're hip

22:25.220 --> 22:27.160
$40 a year

22:27.160 --> 22:29.000
Okay

22:29.000 --> 22:32.600
This this is they say as they bring the beta to an end

22:32.800 --> 22:39.120
They're exiting beta as sync 2.0 comes out bit torrent is introducing a business focused pro tier starting at

22:40.000 --> 22:42.600
$39.99 per year per user not per device

22:42.600 --> 22:48.960
But per user to date there have been over 10 million downloads of the alpha and beta versions of sync generating 145

22:49.400 --> 22:50.720
petabytes of data

22:50.720 --> 22:57.320
According to the VP product management Eric pounds in an interview at TechCrunch the pro products $40 charge

22:57.320 --> 23:00.400
They say is competitive when you compare it to Microsoft's

23:01.080 --> 23:07.200
$90 for owner own cloud or what in our own cloud on one drive and the $99 for Dropbox

23:08.240 --> 23:16.440
Here's the really big catch though the free edition if you don't pay the $40 per year for bit torrent sync now the free edition

23:17.340 --> 23:19.480
limited to 10 folders

23:19.480 --> 23:22.840
Unlimited in size in those 10 folders

23:23.680 --> 23:26.400
So that means at the root level only 10 folders

23:27.880 --> 23:33.600
So the other features of pro include control over folder permissions and ownership that can you can change at any time

23:34.600 --> 23:39.520
Once you link all personal devices together via private editing all your shared folders available wherever you need them

23:40.240 --> 23:45.320
Consume on-demand view contents of very large folders consume only the content you need and preserve the storage capacity

23:45.320 --> 23:48.240
Which is useful especially say on mobile devices that is very useful

23:48.240 --> 23:49.680
I use Dropbox. It's one of the reasons

23:49.680 --> 23:56.200
I still use Dropbox very heavily selective sync and also adding private you get you get technical support like priority technical support

23:56.960 --> 23:58.960
for the pro version

23:59.200 --> 24:02.840
Limited to 10 folders now if you update to the new bit torrent sync 2.0

24:03.440 --> 24:07.000
They just came out today boy, you know, I'm actually for now

24:07.000 --> 24:11.160
I'm okay with it, but I think in the future I might have to start looking at alternatives

24:11.160 --> 24:18.080
I don't know. Hmm. I feel I don't know. It's a boy. I mean, I'm not I'm not real happy with it

24:18.080 --> 24:24.400
I know that but I sure am getting sick of the beta label being used as an excuse for making bait and switches

24:24.400 --> 24:24.680
Okay

24:24.680 --> 24:29.480
Cuz here's what I feel like what happened is here everybody go out and implement our technology help us prove it out

24:29.480 --> 24:33.000
Make sure we bang on the code, but also get hooked on our infrastructure

24:33.040 --> 24:38.400
Yeah, and then oh by the way now now thanks that it's no longer beta

24:38.400 --> 24:42.280
So now we get to charge. Oh, but we're also gonna remove functionality

24:42.880 --> 24:45.360
right because see the problem is is I have like I

24:46.200 --> 24:51.880
Have a folder for all the unfiltered supporter shows notes all the notes for all the unfiltered shows

24:52.200 --> 24:54.920
Well that I share that folder out directly

24:54.920 --> 24:58.960
So when you subscribe to that folder you get every shows notes in one folder

24:58.960 --> 25:01.920
Well right now that'd be that's hundreds of folders, right?

25:02.120 --> 25:07.040
So I would have to restructure the way I do all my sinks and put that in this it just doesn't work

25:07.040 --> 25:11.680
It doesn't work at all for me. It's this sort of this totally breaks the way I use BitTorrent sync

25:12.920 --> 25:18.520
Well, I also think it proves a good argument for other alternatives at some point, you know something

25:18.520 --> 25:23.160
It's open source that you know is not as likely to do that to you in the future. But the same. Yeah, so I

25:25.480 --> 25:31.440
Go ahead with it. I've I've been testing alternatives as I

25:31.440 --> 25:38.440
a full back plan for bt-sync because this has been rumored for yeah for some months now

25:38.440 --> 25:43.040
Yeah, and the only solution I found and this is for my personal

25:43.880 --> 25:50.680
synchronization of files that can rival bt-sync in terms of volume of files and size of files is

25:51.360 --> 25:54.280
cfile s e a f i l e

25:54.280 --> 26:02.400
Right see see file comm which is an open source solution. I I can't get sync thing to scale up to

26:02.800 --> 26:09.240
What I'm trying to do, but see file does but I don't know Chris whether it's going to work for your use case or not

26:09.240 --> 26:12.880
So you'll have to give it a try and see how it works

26:13.440 --> 26:18.600
because being able to just give out a key and then anybody just has that key and now is thinking is

26:18.600 --> 26:25.560
Even though that that big long key is scary-looking the in in actual practice. That is so elegant

26:25.560 --> 26:30.160
No links needed no names nothing to search right? Yeah

26:30.160 --> 26:35.640
I don't even have to like go like give them an email address to the bittorrent sync program to send them an invite link

26:35.640 --> 26:37.000
like I could just

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
instant message them a hash key and

26:41.160 --> 26:43.640
It's just so nice and miss that I'm gonna miss that so much

26:43.640 --> 26:49.160
So this that's the and that's a major problem with sync thing. That's the major major problem with sync thing

26:49.160 --> 26:54.240
Is I just could not individually add every single person to my swarm and and sync thing

26:54.240 --> 26:59.520
Even if you've got, you know, four or five laptops, you know shared between your family

26:59.720 --> 27:04.600
Then it gets in a pickle just managing that few number of devices

27:05.240 --> 27:07.400
So yeah sync thing

27:07.400 --> 27:14.880
Really doesn't work so well once you get beyond a few devices the other nice thing about the way the bittorrent sync works is

27:15.280 --> 27:16.880
essentially a CDN

27:16.880 --> 27:21.240
Because there's as a few people grab the file they then see the rest of the other files

27:21.240 --> 27:24.120
So it's I really like the way it distributes large media files

27:25.760 --> 27:28.020
So I wonder if I bought the pro

27:28.640 --> 27:34.200
which is pretty easy to justify as a business expense if the everyone else subscribing would have to have pro or if

27:34.200 --> 27:38.120
or if they just get if they just get the advantage of

27:38.840 --> 27:43.360
Me having pro so I can have more than ten folders. That's fine. I'll spend $40 for that. I

27:44.640 --> 27:48.680
Think that's an important differentiator because even if it's in fact that they don't have to have pro now

27:48.800 --> 27:52.760
What's to say six months down the road? They're like, hey, you know, we could really increase our revenue

27:52.760 --> 27:56.240
Yeah, that's the problem on both ends to get to that many folders

27:56.240 --> 27:58.160
Yeah, that's the question like on Dropbox, right?

27:58.160 --> 28:03.380
If you have a really big folder both people on both ends of the Dropbox have to have more storage on their account

28:03.380 --> 28:08.280
So I guess historically if we look at this based on their pattern of behavior

28:08.280 --> 28:11.600
We know that they have no problem shafting you for a buck

28:11.800 --> 28:16.760
So it may be good to look into some alternatives now before it becomes even more

28:17.400 --> 28:22.180
Later, man, you're making me sad dude. I know giving you a sad you are you are

28:22.920 --> 28:29.660
Because really this this this works so well for what I need because it doesn't it doesn't require any centralized cloud storage

28:29.660 --> 28:36.820
You know, it distributes these large files each person acts as a seeder. It's it's just the publishing process

28:36.820 --> 28:40.340
This would be true with most sync things with the publishing processes. I drop things in a folder

28:41.300 --> 28:46.720
So I think going forward because realistically you pulling the plug on it just out of spite right now

28:46.720 --> 28:51.580
It's just not realistic going forward keep things as they're going now do what you got to do to keep it up

28:51.580 --> 28:55.700
But in the background begin looking at alternatives that you have to pull the trigger

28:55.700 --> 28:59.740
You literally just basically you switch the tracks versus going. Oh my god

29:00.940 --> 29:07.700
Daredevil and you had something you wanted to jump in with yes, pretty much. I was just wanted to point out that own cloud even though

29:07.700 --> 29:13.060
It's currently not supporting and they didn't even set up as in the roadmap of setting

29:13.060 --> 29:20.420
Let's say the clients can actually go and work as a central place as well the client itself, but they have federated own cloud

29:20.420 --> 29:24.860
A hosting so you could have to own clouds communicating together

29:25.140 --> 29:27.620
So I'm not sure how feasible would it be?

29:27.620 --> 29:33.860
But then I would have to have like everybody in the unfiltered audience that wants to participate with an own cloud instance. Yeah, I

29:34.940 --> 29:37.460
Mean, it's like the same way you have the client though

29:37.460 --> 29:43.380
So if you instead think of it as if you had it locally installed instead of in a server, right?

29:43.380 --> 29:49.220
And that's the federation you have well, that's pretty much what you already have which is a client right now and

29:49.220 --> 29:52.060
Heaven's revenge you wanted to mention pure io

29:53.500 --> 29:57.320
Yes, I found this little programmer application called pure io

29:57.900 --> 30:00.260
a few days ago it is

30:01.020 --> 30:04.780
Kind of a personalized vault that you use. There's no

30:06.500 --> 30:13.180
Limitations on file size. It's got a built-in messenger. It's actually built from the same person who makes mini lock and crypto cat

30:13.740 --> 30:15.820
Everything is encrypted and you will only have the key

30:15.820 --> 30:20.300
It is interesting because it's only for you and I know that you can send

30:20.700 --> 30:25.080
messages to people and I can send you a link to the file, but it's not much of a

30:26.380 --> 30:28.080
synchronization sort of

30:28.080 --> 30:33.740
R-sync or bit torrent sync type thing which kind of link all of your things together

30:33.740 --> 30:39.300
But you do you can send files around and there is no limitation. It's limited by your

30:40.140 --> 30:44.860
Upstream bandwidth or downstream bandwidth and whoever you send the messages to it's more of a

30:44.860 --> 30:46.860
completely

30:47.020 --> 30:50.560
Seems like it'd be a good collaborative like little back and forth

30:52.060 --> 30:59.980
Families use it. I've been trying to use it with a few like one friend, but it's not very I can't exactly give a full

31:01.340 --> 31:06.500
Recommendation based on only using it with one person. Okay, I might I might play around with it a bit

31:06.500 --> 31:13.780
It looks and there's a Chrome extension you can add it's native which can be on Mac Windows or any Chrome

31:13.780 --> 31:15.780
That you want. So here I owe

31:16.260 --> 31:20.300
Platform here. I owe comm and I'll have a link in the show notes appear. I owe comm

31:21.260 --> 31:25.200
Okay, wimpy you wanted to jump in on the own cloud sinking point

31:26.500 --> 31:32.420
Yeah, I've tried own cloud through version five six seven and eight

31:33.540 --> 31:37.140
On its eight seven, which what was out now eight is that the new one?

31:37.140 --> 31:44.020
I was blessed. Yeah, and it's great for sinking, you know contacts and calendar and stuff like that

31:44.020 --> 31:49.940
I've had good success in using it for that, but I've never really got it to work. Well with with large

31:50.700 --> 31:53.540
volumes of file synchronization

31:54.500 --> 31:58.820
And I've really tried I really want that to work because everyone keeps raving about it

31:58.820 --> 32:06.260
And I don't think that I can be so unusual because it's just just me and some some data that I need to shunt around

32:06.260 --> 32:13.000
The place but yeah, I just cut I can't get it to work for me reliably and the thing is is it sort of fails

32:13.380 --> 32:20.680
Silently so you end up with all of your devices out of sync and then you have to sort of unpick the tangle

32:20.860 --> 32:22.700
by hand

32:22.700 --> 32:23.980
so

32:23.980 --> 32:25.260
Yeah, yeah

32:25.260 --> 32:31.580
No, it's a nose experienced quite a few problems with the file sink as well bit torrent sink has been a rock for me

32:31.580 --> 32:34.240
So even more so than bit dropbox has been

32:34.240 --> 32:38.320
Yeah, yeah, it's been super reliable for me. And that's why I'm so

32:39.120 --> 32:44.960
Disappointed that yeah, you know, we hoped that it might become open source, but no they've gone the other way

32:44.960 --> 32:49.920
Yeah, you know that's part of that's part of what feels like the bait-and-switch is they were kind of

32:51.320 --> 32:58.160
You know, they danced around that oh, maybe yeah, we'll think about it. Now it feels like that was sort of a mislead

32:58.160 --> 33:04.240
Feels a little bad lucky, you know, it feels good Linux fest Northwest and I'm the reason why I'm plucking this because I want

33:04.240 --> 33:06.080
To meet you. I want to say hi to you or say hi to you again

33:06.080 --> 33:10.480
If you made it before come say hi to Matt too. He'll be there right now. You're gonna make it right now

33:10.480 --> 33:14.640
Oh, absolutely talk. I'm sure by then we'll have a few episodes of how to Linux out

33:14.640 --> 33:20.240
So people have all kinds of things to talk to you about and we'll also have as much of the crew coming as possible

33:20.240 --> 33:22.240
so it'd be great to see you and

33:22.400 --> 33:24.880
We are in the process this week

33:24.880 --> 33:27.280
Kind of like really locking in some plans

33:27.280 --> 33:33.360
So if you'd like to be involved somehow or something to contribute email Angela at Jupiter broadcasting comm and let her know

33:33.840 --> 33:40.960
And it's it's April 25th and 26 Bellingham, Washington Linux fest Northwest 2015. I think we should be considered a sponsor

33:40.960 --> 33:42.960
You know, I'm gonna talk to them. I plug them like every week

33:43.280 --> 33:48.000
Yeah, you should I don't want to see you guys there because I'm gonna be walking around a bit more

33:48.000 --> 33:52.160
Will there be swag, you know, actually so there's a lot of stuff going on in there

33:52.160 --> 33:55.520
Will there be swag, you know, actually, so this is something

33:56.160 --> 34:00.080
Where we are talking about we're talking about doing a limited run Linux fest Northwest shirt

34:00.800 --> 34:05.840
Because one of the things we want to do is offer reimbursement for some of the people that have to travel

34:07.040 --> 34:12.240
because if you think about it like Chris Moore is on the is on the east coast, of course

34:12.800 --> 34:15.120
Q5 and rotten corpse are on the east, right?

34:15.120 --> 34:21.680
So it to bring to bring them in and Alan as well, although Alan I suspect will probably volunteer to fund himself

34:21.680 --> 34:26.880
But I would offer to fund his trip as well all on the east to bring them over to Linux fest Northwest

34:26.960 --> 34:28.960
And then to put them up in a room

34:29.520 --> 34:31.440
For three days or whatever it's going to be

34:32.240 --> 34:33.360
uh

34:33.360 --> 34:35.520
Yeah, that's going to be a nightmare expense-wise

34:35.600 --> 34:35.920
So yeah

34:35.920 --> 34:41.920
We'll probably run a limited run Linux fest Northwest shirt to try to not only give you guys something unique for Linux fest that

34:41.920 --> 34:43.920
We can have there which means we got to start it soon

34:44.160 --> 34:45.600
But to also help

34:45.600 --> 34:49.440
Raise funds to cover some of those costs. I don't think it would cover even half of it

34:49.440 --> 34:53.200
But maybe we could who knows so we'll probably have more about that soon and i'll let you know

34:53.760 --> 34:57.920
Well and speaking of doing something soon regarding Linux fest Northwest i've been going for many years

34:57.920 --> 35:03.680
I'm actually originally from Bellingham. So i'm going to give you all some advice when it comes to hotels and motels start reserving immediately

35:03.840 --> 35:05.040
Don't wait

35:05.040 --> 35:09.040
Yeah, get get in early because it will fill up so fast and you will be left with the places on the

35:09.600 --> 35:12.160
The motels you might not want to stay in i'll just leave it at that

35:12.240 --> 35:18.400
There uh, there are some really good ones too, but you get them good and fast. Uh, yeah Bellingham is um,

35:18.400 --> 35:23.520
Um, it's a good taste of Washington in an interesting way. It's a little eclectic. It's a little hippie, but it's

35:25.120 --> 35:25.840
Yeah, okay

35:25.840 --> 35:27.040
Well speaking of hippie, um

35:27.040 --> 35:32.080
If you the two areas you want to pay attention to meridian and fair haven that's pretty much where you want your hotels to appear

35:32.240 --> 35:36.080
You want to avoid uh, sammich, uh, generally speaking. Yeah, there's some that's pretty hit and miss

35:36.160 --> 35:36.640
But yeah

35:36.640 --> 35:42.640
Also, uh, if you are a beer fan some of the best beer in the pacific northwest is going to be there

35:42.960 --> 35:47.600
A lot of great breweries up there also some folks, uh at the fest usually every year who are uh,

35:47.600 --> 35:52.000
Uh brewers that use linux we've featured them before they'll be there. I mean really good stuff

35:52.880 --> 35:58.160
Traditionally also they've had an after party at the spark museum, which is a really great radio museum

35:58.400 --> 36:03.920
Really really nice and they have a tesla coil there that they fire off and there's food. It's it's a really unique thing

36:04.480 --> 36:08.400
Uh, and bellingham's all about the food and the brew for sure. Yeah, so it's a good trip

36:08.480 --> 36:13.040
It's and and linux fest northwest. I I think you know having been around and seen a lot of them

36:13.040 --> 36:15.600
I think this is got to be in one of the top three fests

36:15.600 --> 36:17.600
Uh in the country, so

36:18.080 --> 36:21.200
Well, it's cool to watch how it's matured over the years because I mean you remember the old ones

36:21.280 --> 36:27.440
I mean, it's just very very different i've been going since not quite but since nearly high school a little bit after high school

36:27.600 --> 36:29.840
Quite and it's been i've been going a really long time

36:30.240 --> 36:35.520
I've been going since the first person I started going with was my high school one of my high school computer teacher

36:36.160 --> 36:38.160
Oh my gosh, that's crazy

36:38.320 --> 36:39.680
I yeah

36:39.680 --> 36:41.840
Now that was a couple years after I was out of high school

36:41.840 --> 36:47.040
But so i've been i've been going so long that i've been going angel used to go with me to help me take notes

36:47.440 --> 36:51.760
And she'd be there for a while when she was pregnant and she'd be like trying to sit in those seats, you know

36:51.840 --> 36:56.000
Be at ball perrego helping me take notes. Yeah. Oh man, that's wild

36:56.160 --> 37:00.240
It really has it really has come into it's something else something else that's kind of unique that they do

37:00.720 --> 37:06.960
Uh, and it's perfect because it's the pacific northwest is they have a college there that has uh, some chef courses

37:06.960 --> 37:12.640
And they do a big barbecue. Now you can leave we often leave because we usually have a large crew but uh,

37:12.720 --> 37:18.000
They're they're at the college campus. They're barbecuing up salmon and ribs and stuff like that

37:18.000 --> 37:19.440
And the salmon's really good stuff

37:19.440 --> 37:24.800
So there's also it's a good opportunity to get some pacific northwest barbecued salmon and they have these big barbecue grills

37:24.800 --> 37:25.840
They cook them on

37:25.840 --> 37:30.480
And there's enough local of uh folks of us that we you know, usually able to provide transportation for most everyone

37:30.480 --> 37:33.600
So yeah, that's a pretty good time. So that'll be uh, april uh,

37:33.600 --> 37:38.480
25th and 26th you can find out more at linuxfestnorthwest.org. They're not paying me to plug it

37:38.480 --> 37:40.880
I just really would like to see you guys and it's a good is we only

37:41.280 --> 37:45.840
It's the biggest one we do in the year because it's here in our backyard and we don't have to fly all the gear everywhere

37:45.920 --> 37:47.520
So we can go a little bigger

37:47.520 --> 37:53.440
Uh, that's right. Hopefully we'll have uh, we'll have maybe by linux action show on sunday. We'll have the uh, fest swag stuff ready

37:54.000 --> 37:54.640
Uh, all right

37:54.640 --> 37:56.640
So, uh, we gotta uh speaking of fest

37:56.640 --> 38:00.240
We gotta talk we got a couple of more interviews to play from scale and then we're gonna talk

38:00.240 --> 38:03.600
Um about mate because I mean damn it

38:04.240 --> 38:11.120
Yeah, I I never would have expected so much exciting things to be happening with a desktop based on the known tomb paradigm

38:11.360 --> 38:11.920
I you know

38:11.920 --> 38:15.840
Like if you would have asked me a year ago where some of the most interesting things were happening

38:16.080 --> 38:20.960
I wasn't I wasn't going to guess that so we're also going to talk to wimpy about some of that stuff because it's crazy exciting

38:21.280 --> 38:24.980
Uh first i'm going to talk about digital ocean head over to digitalocean.com

38:25.680 --> 38:27.680
right now digitalocean

38:27.680 --> 38:29.920
Dot com

38:29.920 --> 38:35.120
Yeah, I don't know i'm trying to make them a jingle we have a uh, oh my we have we do have a promo code though

38:35.120 --> 38:40.880
That I do have do unplugged one word do unplugged go uh, go over there and use that that just keep that in mind

38:40.880 --> 38:43.440
While I tell you about digital ocean now, you'll see why you want a promo code

38:43.680 --> 38:48.400
Uh, so digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider and they're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up

38:48.400 --> 38:51.760
Your own cloud server and it's legit. You're going to get root access to this thing

38:52.000 --> 38:53.520
You get to watch it boot all the way up

38:53.520 --> 38:57.600
You get this great console to manage it and it's a it's a it's a free bsd or a linux rig

38:57.760 --> 39:00.480
Come on, let's be honest. It's gonna be a linux rig, right? You're not an animal

39:00.720 --> 39:03.600
It's a linux rig and it's gonna rock and it's super fast

39:03.680 --> 39:07.920
I I would go recommend you just go spin one up over at digital ocean use the promo code do unplugged

39:07.920 --> 39:13.440
You get a ten dollar credit and just kind of play around with that the package management the speed of it and just have some fun

39:13.680 --> 39:18.560
You'll you'll you'll find too. You'll you'll get started in less than a minute probably about 55 seconds or less

39:18.560 --> 39:21.600
Sometimes it's as low as 26 seconds. I've gotten some crazy tweets

39:21.600 --> 39:24.640
And the pricing plans start only five dollars per month

39:25.120 --> 39:32.260
I'll get you 512 megabytes of ram a 20 gigabyte ssd one cpu and a terabyte of transfer a terabyte

39:32.800 --> 39:34.160
for five dollars

39:34.160 --> 39:35.520
yeah, I

39:35.520 --> 39:37.680
One of the things I do for a living is I distribute content

39:37.840 --> 39:42.000
I can't look at that when I say five dollars, I think maybe i'll just buy like six or seven of these

39:42.480 --> 39:45.040
Right, you know just actually the problem is is uh, let's see

39:45.680 --> 39:48.880
One terabyte. Yeah, that would be a lot of droplets

39:48.880 --> 39:54.000
So, okay wouldn't quite work out but you know you you might not have that problem one terabyte might is I would imagine is

39:54.000 --> 40:01.120
Way more than enough and if you're thinking about maybe setting up something like c file or own cloud or bit torrent sync or sync thing

40:01.600 --> 40:07.760
Isn't drop is you you could go pay for somebody's ridiculous amount of cloud storage or for way less money

40:07.840 --> 40:11.360
You could have it on your own rig up in the cloud that you control at digital ocean

40:11.840 --> 40:16.480
Right. There's a lot of opportunity there. They have one click deployment applications do some really great stuff

40:16.480 --> 40:22.960
You can do full dns management over there. They have data center locations in new york, san francisco, singapore, amsterdam and london

40:23.200 --> 40:26.400
I love that too because if you're going to do the sync stuff, that's something to consider

40:27.280 --> 40:28.000
And then you know

40:28.000 --> 40:33.760
You'll have that interface to manage it and that interface that they have is so intuitive the control panel is crazy powerful

40:33.840 --> 40:35.840
But yet like they didn't make it very complicated

40:35.840 --> 40:39.200
So you can get through to a really fast pace and get everything you need but not feel like

40:39.680 --> 40:45.360
They've removed some sort of necessary feature because they've just they've just spent time to make sure you have access to all that stuff

40:45.360 --> 40:48.560
But it's designed well run all on top of linux

40:48.720 --> 40:53.360
Which is a boatiful at this tier with these tier one data connections go over there right now

40:53.520 --> 40:59.280
Try it out do unplugged go spin yourself up something like a ghost installation or wordpress install

41:00.080 --> 41:02.180
There's so many possibilities digitalocean.com

41:02.480 --> 41:08.960
See what we've been talking about use the promo code do unplugged and a big thanks to digital ocean for sponsoring the linux unplugged program

41:09.920 --> 41:11.600
You guys rock

41:11.600 --> 41:19.440
now matt, uh, I love these clips that kernel linux or aka noah got at uh at scale because

41:19.840 --> 41:24.400
I'd never been and I was kind of on the fence this year. It looks like i'm definitely going next year

41:24.400 --> 41:26.400
There's some great folks to talk to

41:26.560 --> 41:29.840
Uh, why don't we start with the kids on computers initiative?

41:30.080 --> 41:35.120
This is one that a longtime viewer eb wrote in and he said you got to feature this one because I saw it on

41:35.120 --> 41:37.040
Your live event, but you didn't play it in last

41:37.040 --> 41:41.360
He says this is a really good cause and he wanted to know more information about it and he was right

41:41.840 --> 41:44.720
Uh, I went back and I watched the clip and I thought he's absolutely right

41:44.800 --> 41:49.760
So, uh for a good cause here's uh kids on the computer at scale 13 x

41:54.480 --> 41:56.480
So as both a father

41:56.720 --> 41:58.480
As both a father of two kids

41:58.480 --> 42:03.440
That I desperately want them to be all involved in computers at least as much as possible and understanding

42:03.440 --> 42:10.160
Uh the ramifications if they're not into technology and as a person who wants to see linux implemented wherever possible

42:10.480 --> 42:17.840
I was beyond elated to come across stormy with the kids on computers project here at scale where they

42:18.640 --> 42:22.800
Well, they do amazing things. They do amazing things. They not only do they bring computers to kids

42:23.280 --> 42:29.920
They essentially build their own little mini internet to take to places that don't have access to the internet. How are you today stormy?

42:29.920 --> 42:34.160
I'm great. I'm glad to be here at scale talking to everybody about this. Yeah, it's fun, right?

42:35.280 --> 42:37.840
so so I guess my first question is

42:38.640 --> 42:43.780
You obviously when you're dealing if you're if you're if your goal is to go out and put computers

42:44.240 --> 42:48.720
To kids that don't already have them chances are that there's probably not a lot of money

42:48.800 --> 42:52.880
The budget isn't real high for doing these kinds of things, right? No, they usually have no budget

42:52.960 --> 42:59.120
So we actually we either collect donated computers and install linux and free software on them educational software

42:59.120 --> 43:04.160
Or we we apply for grants and get money to buy new computers, but the schools themselves have no money

43:04.640 --> 43:08.800
We do like the communities be very involved. So it's been really awesome at some of our schools

43:08.800 --> 43:12.320
The parents do fundraisers are they pitching a dollar or two a month per kid?

43:12.320 --> 43:16.880
Which is a lot of money for them and they've been able to like set up computer labs build the buildings

43:17.280 --> 43:21.360
Um both parents, you know, they had parents build the buildings to put the computer labs in

43:21.840 --> 43:25.120
Um, they hired computer teachers off of donations that they've they've gotten

43:25.120 --> 43:30.560
So we work in communities where people are really willing to give and they participate but there's no money there. So

43:31.840 --> 43:33.840
Can you can you tell me why?

43:34.080 --> 43:37.040
Uh, can you tell me how that plays into linux first? I mean, why not?

43:37.440 --> 43:41.040
Why not purchase microsoft windows or why not purchase a bunch of macs?

43:41.680 --> 43:45.840
So our goal is to empower kids to be able to create and to do things in the world

43:46.160 --> 43:50.400
And and so by giving them linux and free software things that they can like learn how they work

43:50.560 --> 43:51.360
Maybe not in the beginning

43:51.360 --> 43:55.600
But you know they can learn how they work and they tweak them and they can build on it. It's much more powerful

43:55.680 --> 43:59.760
Than teaching them that the world is about pirated software that they have to steal from someone

44:02.000 --> 44:03.600
Right on the head right on the head

44:03.600 --> 44:05.760
So uh, so in a lot of these places

44:05.840 --> 44:10.480
I understand that there isn't a lot of money and that that leads to not a lot of services and not a lot of services means

44:10.720 --> 44:16.880
There perhaps might not actually be internet there. So tell me about the tools that you give these kids so that they can access

44:17.440 --> 44:19.760
The internet without having access to the internet

44:19.760 --> 44:24.720
Yeah, so the main thing we wanted to bring was like the knowledge of the world and education to these kids

44:25.040 --> 44:30.800
Um, so we've worked with different things like rachel and khan academy and we give them essentially on every machine for sure

44:31.260 --> 44:36.900
Educational software so they can play math games or things. We give them a full offline copy of wikipedia

44:37.680 --> 44:39.680
usually in their native language and

44:40.240 --> 44:45.600
I'm always in their native language so far and we we give them a complete set of the khan academy videos

44:45.600 --> 44:51.520
Um, all the ones in their language as well. That's crazy. So we don't have wikipedia. We don't have access to wikipedia

44:51.600 --> 44:54.320
So we'll bring the wikipedia to you. Yes, it's really amazing

44:54.400 --> 44:59.680
They have an entire more than what it would be in a set of encyclopedias on every computer and they can look up their book

45:00.000 --> 45:04.160
It's cool in one school. We were setting up the computers and this is in this little town in mexico

45:04.480 --> 45:07.920
That they have they not only don't have internet cell phones don't work though

45:07.920 --> 45:11.280
They're in a canyon and they don't have any like landlines

45:11.280 --> 45:15.600
So they really don't have any communication and we had three moms come in while we were working

45:15.840 --> 45:19.840
And they sat there the entire afternoon and browsed through wikipedia and khan academy

45:20.560 --> 45:21.840
And this wasn't on the internet

45:21.840 --> 45:27.040
No, no, like just in this little lab in this little town in this little canyon like these people played with it

45:27.120 --> 45:32.640
That's unbelievable. Is there a particular distribution that you use when you go to set up these computers for kids?

45:32.880 --> 45:37.200
We've played with a bunch of them. So we're not tied into any we've tried edubuntu. We've tried libuntu

45:37.520 --> 45:39.520
Um at the moment we're using uber mix

45:39.520 --> 45:45.280
Um, one of the things we need is something that runs with really low memory on really old machines

45:46.000 --> 45:52.960
That's very customizable. So right. Yes, so it has to be new enough. It has to be new enough and late late late enough that

45:53.920 --> 45:58.400
Those kids are getting a good that they're getting a relevant experience and at the same time it has to be a

45:59.100 --> 46:05.360
Accommodating to very legacy hardware essentially. Yeah, it's the hardware and the amount of memory and stuff that were that limits us

46:05.360 --> 46:11.440
Well, that's absolutely outstanding if people wanted to I assume that you guys could always use the donation or could always use a you

46:11.440 --> 46:13.440
Know a plug for uh for your website

46:13.520 --> 46:17.840
So people wanted to give back if people wanted to donate hardware people wanted to donate money. Where could they go?

46:18.320 --> 46:22.160
They could get a ww kids on computers.org. Um, you can get involved there

46:22.160 --> 46:27.840
We're always looking for volunteers whether you like working with technology or you're good at marketing or you speak another language

46:27.920 --> 46:33.600
We've got something to do. Um donations help the money goes a long ways like, you know for very little money

46:33.600 --> 46:38.640
We can bring a donated laptop to a country and give it to someone so donated hardware or money

46:38.880 --> 46:44.000
Um, we're doing a fundraiser here for cool hats. They're made by a local businessman in one of the communities that we work with

46:44.400 --> 46:46.400
Yeah, and so we're selling those as a fundraiser

46:46.720 --> 46:47.040
All right

46:47.040 --> 46:51.520
Well outstanding and this is a way that if you if you uh, if you care to contribute to this project

46:51.760 --> 46:54.080
Not only are you contributing towards linux here?

46:54.160 --> 46:55.760
Not only are contributing towards open source

46:55.760 --> 46:59.840
But you are putting in the hands of kids that wouldn't not only they're not

46:59.840 --> 47:04.400
People that you're not converting people from windows you are converting people from no computer at all

47:04.800 --> 47:08.960
To a linux based experience and that that's essentially what they are going to know

47:08.960 --> 47:12.240
You have the power to do that. So I you know, you know from the bottom of my heart

47:12.240 --> 47:14.480
Thank you for doing what you're doing. Thank you for going out to do all this

47:14.560 --> 47:17.920
This is a super cool project and i'm really excited to follow you and see how things go

47:18.320 --> 47:22.800
Thanks so much for stopping by and spreading the word. Please please come help us out. We appreciate it

47:24.640 --> 47:26.640
That's a pretty neat initiative, uh

47:26.640 --> 47:31.760
I I actually kind of wish I could figure out more of those things and and help direct

47:32.480 --> 47:35.600
More attention to them. I feel like I have just some stuff I could send to these places

47:36.240 --> 47:38.000
We we should seriously one day

47:38.000 --> 47:42.240
I don't know if we'd have to have somebody that would be committed to doing the leg work

47:42.240 --> 47:44.800
but we should seriously consider one day doing a roundup of

47:45.520 --> 47:51.200
Places all around the world maybe or at least in the uk and the us and canada

47:51.200 --> 47:56.080
Uh where uh people could donate equipment that would get then loaded with linux

47:56.320 --> 48:02.080
Like you have to you know stuff that would go for linux towards linux use and deployment. That'd be really cool. Sounds awesome

48:02.960 --> 48:09.840
Uh, well, that was a really interesting, uh initiative. So that's kids on computers and uh, you can uh, you can check that out

48:10.160 --> 48:14.240
So we have uh, we have two more interviews to play and this next one's a bit of a long one

48:14.240 --> 48:16.000
And it's because there's a lot to cover

48:16.000 --> 48:19.680
It's the ubuntu booth one and I saved it just for this episode because it is kind of long

48:19.680 --> 48:24.560
But it's there's so much ground and then the one after that is the one that I never thought we'd feature an interview from

48:25.120 --> 48:28.960
On any of our shows let alone that they were big linux users, but it makes a lot of sense

48:29.040 --> 48:31.040
So we'll start with the ubuntu one first

48:35.760 --> 48:41.200
Many times as I walk around these conferences I find it increasingly difficult to actually find linux

48:41.200 --> 48:46.160
I know that sounds a little weird, but being at a linux convention sometimes finding the linux isn't so easy

48:46.160 --> 48:51.600
I especially have a a place a special place in my heart for people that use linux on the desktop now

48:51.600 --> 48:59.200
I'm here with nathan and he's from ubuntu the community outreach. They he very much cares about seeing linux on the desktop. Isn't that right?

48:59.920 --> 49:01.840
Yeah, it's the most important thing in the world

49:01.840 --> 49:02.560
I agree with you

49:02.560 --> 49:08.000
I mean world peace and and world hunger those things don't pale in comparison to getting people to use linux on the desktop

49:08.160 --> 49:10.400
I think because there's so many proprietary operating systems

49:10.960 --> 49:14.320
On retail stores that that's why we don't have world peace. I agree. I agree

49:14.320 --> 49:18.400
I think it contributes to all the problems in the world. I think if we had desktop linux that would solve all of these

49:18.720 --> 49:20.560
So obviously, uh, we're here

49:20.560 --> 49:23.280
We have some fine looking system 76 machines behind us

49:23.360 --> 49:30.400
And of course the orange which represents ubuntu tell me what it is specifically that makes ubuntu such a great desktop operating system for regular

49:30.560 --> 49:31.600
users

49:31.600 --> 49:35.280
So we take um the hardware capabilities and stability of the linux kernel

49:35.280 --> 49:38.240
We take the massive amount of software available for debian

49:38.720 --> 49:43.680
And additionally for ubuntu we take that we polish it. We have a clear goal of what we want on the desktop

49:43.680 --> 49:49.600
We have the unity desktop interface that scales beautifully to large screens laptops touch screens

49:50.400 --> 49:58.560
Phones as well. Yeah, and so as we take this this uh software with a with a clear strong vision across different devices

49:59.120 --> 50:01.120
Uh, I think that that one

50:01.360 --> 50:07.360
Unified vision is what helps ubuntu be so so awesome on the desktop now. I see that you have the bq there

50:07.520 --> 50:10.640
Uh now those aren't you said those aren't shipping actually until march

50:10.640 --> 50:14.240
So you're kind of a special person in the us to have one of those. Yes

50:14.320 --> 50:19.760
Uh, so there were about 50 people who were uh, ubuntu insiders that were flown to the launch event

50:20.080 --> 50:23.280
I was not one of them stuart langridge was and uh, so I stole his phone

50:23.360 --> 50:28.560
He was he was actually nice to donate it to the booth this weekend and jono might donate his uh tomorrow

50:28.560 --> 50:30.080
So we'll have two of these

50:30.080 --> 50:36.000
And this is just so the nexus fours we have our development phones and they run really beautifully. Um, but there's a lot of um,

50:36.000 --> 50:42.160
The the specs in this are kind of low and people are really upset because they're used to really high-end android phones performing

50:42.160 --> 50:48.560
Okay, well even just so optimized this uh, this phone works beautifully. Uh,

50:49.440 --> 50:52.480
You know just even on on these specs so we're demonstrating that today

50:52.960 --> 50:54.160
That's outstanding now

50:54.160 --> 50:56.400
How do you like the actual usability of ubuntu?

50:56.960 --> 51:01.200
On the phone because I I installed it and granted it was a couple months ago

51:01.440 --> 51:04.640
But I found there were some very key features I found to be lacking

51:04.640 --> 51:06.880
So for example, I didn't see an email client

51:07.840 --> 51:13.760
So there is an email client, uh, it's it's been developed by um by uh, I think they're canonical members

51:13.840 --> 51:18.080
But but by the community and it's a part of uh of uh, trello. I think it's called deco

51:18.320 --> 51:22.160
Okay, and so it doesn't ship on the phone by default, but it is in the store for free

51:22.480 --> 51:25.280
And once it's super stable, it's a little bare bones

51:25.600 --> 51:28.560
Although it's getting just to where I think it's a actually really nice client

51:28.880 --> 51:31.920
Uh, as that is that grows more mature it'll be shipped by default

51:31.920 --> 51:35.120
But it is in the store and and it's a it's a really nice client

51:35.840 --> 51:38.320
All right. There you go. And there's a little audio pop. So i'll leave it there

51:38.480 --> 51:40.240
Um, boy, it was a good interview, too

51:40.240 --> 51:42.880
But i'll have to uh, i'll pull out more clips if there's more in there

51:42.960 --> 51:47.360
Maybe next week can play it because that pop in that audio happens sometimes from the conversion of the camera clips

51:48.000 --> 51:51.680
All right. So, uh one last interview to round out our scale coverage

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
And this is the company I never thought we'd have an interview with on the show

51:56.000 --> 52:01.680
Uh, and it turns out they use quite a bit of linux

52:03.360 --> 52:10.160
Okay, we're here at scale 2015 scale 13x we're walking around and I expect to see a lot of linux when I go to these

52:10.240 --> 52:11.760
linux conventions

52:11.760 --> 52:17.760
Sometimes the linux isn't quite as obvious as you might think it is and that is exactly what I found out when I came across

52:18.240 --> 52:21.920
Disney who doesn't love disney, so i'm here to talk a little bit

52:21.920 --> 52:28.820
Uh, what exactly disney does with linux how you guys use linux and yeah for anyone that thinks that disney is all about cartoons

52:29.280 --> 52:32.400
And animations all of that stuff is actually powered by linux

52:32.880 --> 52:35.200
Correct. So we actually have linux running in

52:35.680 --> 52:42.000
A lot of our operation environments and one question that you actually asked me was if we had linux running in our desktop environment

52:42.160 --> 52:48.160
Right and that is so especially in our animation environment. They actually have fully linux based environment

52:48.160 --> 52:53.360
So, um a lot of times individuals will sort of uh identify disney as a brand

52:53.920 --> 52:56.080
And the affinity just to themselves

52:56.560 --> 53:01.760
but the amount of technology that disney uses to actually support its business lines is

53:02.240 --> 53:07.440
Huge and linux is actually a very large component to that technology line, which is why we're here

53:07.680 --> 53:10.560
Yeah, well and so and you know, and of course it goes without saying that

53:11.200 --> 53:17.440
The linux community in general always appreciates people like you that that that build a business on the backbone of linux that are willing

53:17.440 --> 53:22.000
To give back that sponsor these kinds of events that come here and talk about I mean, that's you know, that that

53:22.880 --> 53:24.160
Right from this perspective

53:24.160 --> 53:27.840
It's about being able to go ahead and provide the community with a little bit of

53:28.240 --> 53:34.180
Sort of support overall in general and letting them know what it is that we do with this line of technology

53:34.800 --> 53:38.480
And just making sure that people understand that it can go hand in hand

53:38.560 --> 53:45.200
So we have obviously a huge brand that's out there, but a lot of it is done with amazing technology such as linux

53:45.200 --> 53:51.040
So and the reason I brought up the desktop thing is because you walk around and you see a lot of the presenters

53:51.440 --> 53:54.480
They they talk about linux and they talk about building their business on linux

53:54.480 --> 53:58.960
But at the same time they don't trust linux enough to actually use it on a day-to-day basis

53:59.040 --> 54:02.800
It might be in it might be on the servers in the back end that does that stuff

54:02.800 --> 54:03.920
But they're not looking at it

54:03.920 --> 54:05.040
They're not interacting with it

54:05.040 --> 54:09.600
And what was interesting when I was speaking with you is I get the impression that there are places in disney where?

54:10.240 --> 54:12.720
When you walk into work everything is linux

54:12.720 --> 54:20.080
I'd probably say in selective environments, especially in areas like animation or our feature animation environment

54:20.080 --> 54:21.680
That is so the case

54:21.680 --> 54:27.120
And that is just generally case by case in terms of how much linux is used overall within each environment

54:27.200 --> 54:32.800
So it may not be the case for all environments, but specifically especially for our animation teams

54:32.800 --> 54:35.920
It's a very big part of their day-to-day

54:36.240 --> 54:36.960
That would be yeah

54:36.960 --> 54:40.000
And what would really be cool is if someday those tools that you guys use

54:40.000 --> 54:43.680
If those ever became available for purchase or for that would be absolutely awesome

54:44.320 --> 54:49.280
If somebody wanted to find out more about uh, disney and disney's involved as linux. Is there somewhere you can point them or

54:49.840 --> 54:51.840
um

54:52.080 --> 54:54.880
In terms of disney and disney's involvement with linux

54:55.360 --> 54:59.140
I probably say in general you can go ahead and sort of check out disney technology

55:00.320 --> 55:04.960
Dot com or a little bit more so I would say, uh, disney tech jobs dot com

55:04.960 --> 55:11.920
um through disney tech jobs dot com, you'll actually get a really good understanding of our overall technology environment and sort of

55:12.240 --> 55:17.840
How we're able to go ahead and kind of use linux as well as other open source technologies within our environments

55:17.840 --> 55:22.960
And that's going to be specific to every segment and every position that we have. That's absolutely outstanding

55:22.960 --> 55:25.840
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us. Really appreciate it. Thank you

55:27.600 --> 55:30.000
And as colonel linux points out in the chat room

55:30.560 --> 55:33.840
They are hiring so uh, you can get yourself a gig at disney

55:33.840 --> 55:35.840
Uh managing some linux servers

55:36.640 --> 55:41.920
You know instantly my brain flashes to that song from frozen. Let it go. She's talking about proprietary software

55:43.200 --> 55:45.120
Let it go. Let it go

55:45.120 --> 55:46.880
Let it go

55:46.880 --> 55:53.680
Get it out of here. I think is uh, yeah, let it go because it is wasted effort

55:54.480 --> 56:00.800
Yeah, exactly. Yes. Nice. Very good callback, man. Very good callback. Uh, all right. Well, we gotta talk mate. We got umate

56:00.800 --> 56:05.360
Uh don't pursue. Oh, thanks sarah. Well, you know, I thought if this podcasting thing didn't work out

56:05.360 --> 56:08.160
I would okay. No, you don't think I could become a disney singer

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Well, there goes that plan

56:13.040 --> 56:14.160
Yeah

56:14.160 --> 56:17.760
Guess I better stick to reading ads and that's why our next segment is brought to you by

56:18.240 --> 56:21.280

Slash unplugged so why go to like high because i'll tell you why linux academy is built by people who are crazy passionate

56:39.780 --> 56:44.180
About linux they get the open source community. They're involved in it developers

56:44.740 --> 56:51.540
And educators came together and created a platform that they call linux academy and it is awesome. It is a resource you can go to

56:51.540 --> 56:57.640
To learn just about anything in the spectrum of linux open source amazon web services

56:58.180 --> 57:02.980
Big technology stacks that you really want to deep dive into and walk away with expert knowledge stuff

57:02.980 --> 57:06.900
You can go take the test and pass and I can't tell you how many success stories I hear

57:07.220 --> 57:12.340
It's amazing and part of the part of the reason is because I understand what the problem is with all the other systems

57:12.740 --> 57:17.700
All the other systems are generic. They're just general training platforms. This is built for this kind of stuff

57:17.780 --> 57:21.060
I'll give you a few examples. Um, you just choose from any distribution you want

57:21.060 --> 57:23.860
They have seven plus distributions you choose from the courseware

57:24.660 --> 57:30.340
Adjusts to match those distributions the virtual machines for the labs automatically adjust to that distribution, right?

57:30.420 --> 57:34.260
Because they get it you can download the study guides and just keep them. They're yours

57:34.420 --> 57:36.980
They have live stream events where you can ask the educators

57:37.220 --> 57:40.980
It's so nice because you can also go in and keep track of your progress and see right where you left off

57:40.980 --> 57:44.180
See how far you've gotten see how much longer you have to get how long it's going to take you

57:44.580 --> 57:48.020
It's really easy to wrap your brain around this stuff like for me

57:48.020 --> 57:53.140
I go and i'm like, okay now i'm going to learn python now in the past before I had linux academy

57:53.220 --> 57:59.060
And I have an active subscription to linux academy. I would have really had this nebulous ambiguous goal

58:00.100 --> 58:06.100
Self I will learn python and and I would then what go get a book go do go google

58:06.500 --> 58:09.380
Like but then how do I know like the guide i'm reading is any good?

58:09.940 --> 58:14.900
It's just this just it's it was never really a way. I would actually take action on it

58:14.900 --> 58:18.660
That was always the problem I would get to is I couldn't really conceptualize it and take action

58:18.820 --> 58:22.900
Linux academy solves all of that because they really wrap it in something. I can put my brain around

58:22.900 --> 58:27.220
They have an introduction guide that's going to take you five hours. Here's some course material. I get it

58:27.300 --> 58:30.280
It clicks and now I can get the job done linuxacademy.com

58:31.220 --> 58:34.100
Slash unplug go sign up make your skill set a little bit better

58:34.260 --> 58:38.180
You're not familiar with docker, but you've been hearing a lot about it. Go take a course on it

58:38.340 --> 58:41.860
You need to go administer some kvm systems go take a course on it

58:41.860 --> 58:47.160
You're going to go work on aws go use one of those scenario based trainings and actually work with the technology

58:47.380 --> 58:49.720
Before you have to go put your hands on it linuxacademy.com

58:50.420 --> 58:55.780
Slash unplugged and a big thanks to linux academy for sponsoring the linux unplugged program you guys keep it up

58:55.780 --> 58:59.540
They have a whole bunch of new stuff coming up. So it's really a good time to become a subscriber

58:59.620 --> 59:01.620
I'll talk about that more really soon

59:02.340 --> 59:04.420
Mr. Wimpy if you still around sir

59:04.420 --> 59:07.060
I had a few things I wanted to pick your ears and brains about

59:07.060 --> 59:13.880
Uh, and that is the stuff coming up for the big ubuntu mattei project, which is now a powerhouse among distributions

59:14.420 --> 59:20.420
That is not only an official flavor of ubuntu, but apparently is so damn rich

59:21.220 --> 59:24.420
Is just giving out money to other open source projects. What's going on?

59:25.700 --> 59:27.700
Well, uh, yeah

59:28.740 --> 59:30.820
Powerhouse and rich is that so?

59:30.820 --> 59:36.100
Um, I don't know where to start with that really

59:37.940 --> 59:38.900
Yeah

59:38.900 --> 59:44.340
It's all full of superlatives. Uh, how do I follow that? Um, yes. Well, uh, I suppose

59:44.740 --> 59:49.140
Um the big news is we're now an official part of the ubuntu family

59:49.140 --> 59:54.740
Which is just terrific and we're already reaping the uh benefits of being

59:55.220 --> 59:57.560
part of the official canonical

59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.700
uh infrastructure team and

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:07.260
having uh, and also getting consideration from you know, the the wider ubuntu group

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:12.300
On decisions that are being made now. So that's really great. So i'll give you an example

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:16.140
so today I was contacted by two of the guys that are

01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:20.140
uh working mostly on bringing system d

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:27.920
Enablement 1504 and they wanted to make sure that ubuntu mate 1504 was going to play nicely with system d

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:33.040
And they gave me all of the tips about how I could test this

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.560
And make sure it was working. Okay, because they they want a tick in the box that ubuntu mate is going to work

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.960
And so now being official, you know, we're given that kind of due diligence and that's just terrific. Yeah, no kidding

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:51.040
That is really great. And plus you get also the hosting infrastructure for the repos and the iso images

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.960
Yes, yeah, so there's a number of other benefits. So we've got access to the build server now, so um

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:06.160
Uh, that's terrific and and more importantly the official build infrastructure because i'd had to sort of reverse engineer it as best as I could

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:08.400
and I think to

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:16.640
Most people the ubuntu mate images look and feel and smell like real ubuntu, but I knew where they weren't quite the real deal

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:22.240
uh, so now they really are so for example now on ubuntu mate you can now use the uh,

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:29.760
The oem config so you can you know install a batch of machines in oem mode and then uh,

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:36.560
Close them up and uh when you turn them on it asks you, you know who you are and where you are

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.480
Does it mean at some point?

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:45.600
I would maybe be able to be like on a bare ubuntu like server type install and do apt-get install ubuntu dash mate

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.840
That's all possible now. So that all happened a couple of days ago

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:54.480
So if you were to download the mini iso for example go really trim

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:59.920
Uh, you can now do a task cell install of the ubuntu mate, uh desktop

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:04.400
So, uh, it's all it's all you know fully enabled throughout the stack now

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.400
Wow, that is a big deal

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:14.000
Congratulations. Yeah. Yeah, it's terrific. It's been it's been a long old grind and and really the tipping point was um,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.680
About a month ago. I was fortunate enough to travel to montreal with work

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:21.120
And one of the guys from canonical

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:28.800
Who i'd been working with to try and do all of the back end build infrastructure enablement was based in montreal

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.880
So, uh, I met up with him and uh, we went out for coffee and beers and went to

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.000
The montreal university and went to the montreal linux meetup for the evening

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:45.280
And we and we hacked away on this for sort of um until about four o'clock in the morning

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:51.520
And that was really where it all started to sort of gather momentum and and start to sort of fall into place. So, um,

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:56.080
Yeah cypher mox as he's known in the irc. He was he was terrific

01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:02.640
He's really made a big difference and there's about uh, eight or nine people at canonical that have really really sort of made this

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.680
Happen in the last two weeks. It's been uh, it's been great

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:11.840
Now, uh, there's also a couple other things. I want to talk to you about number one is uh, you did something that I think uh,

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.120
Would be

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:17.120
Really neat to see a lot of other projects too. So you have some community funds, right?

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:23.040
Uh does help pay for the cost of the projects and I guess there was extra funds and so you kind of paid it forward

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:27.120
That's right. So, um, one of the things that came out of the community

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.920
back last year was um,

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.240
they wanted a community site that wasn't hosted through the social networks because

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.520
You have a lot of people that are uncomfortable with signing up to facebook and twitter and google and what have you?

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:45.600
So I said well i'd be perfectly happy to um host it all and and you know put it all together

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.600
But I couldn't afford to run it myself. So I started a

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.200
Funding campaign to just cover the costs of hosting a server

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:59.760
And the money started trickling in around november time last year, and I just gave it a couple of months lead time

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.680
So I knew i'd got a buffer, you know, so that um, it was comfortable

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:10.640
But um, it kind of uh overtook itself. So we're comfortably funding a rather beefy server

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:16.160
So it's a a quad core server with four gigs of ram and raid six disk and uh,

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:22.240
Six terabytes of um bandwidth per month and that's where we're hosting our discourse community

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.680
In addition to what we do in the social networks

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:31.280
And we're now using that to really sort of develop some of the teams in the project as well interesting because i've noticed

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:36.000
You know, the project's also pretty active on google plus in the ubuntu community. Yeah

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.000
Yeah, it's it's active on google plus also

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.800
Also surprisingly active on facebook as well. One of the community members started a facebook group. I wasn't sure whether that was going

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:50.320
To be any use or not, but i'd say that's almost as big as um,

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.840
As the google plus group and growing much quicker because it was it was

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.400
Some months behind

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.760
Um, but anyway, we've had all of this money donated which is terrific

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.400
And i've been thinking about you know, how we can can make use of it

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:09.840
And i'd originally been thinking of doing like, um, uh, you know code bounty something like that

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:15.440
But I thought it would be better to actually identify projects that we're already making use of

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
and sort of um

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.240
Fund those projects. Oh, very cool. So we've got to a point now where we've we're not rolling in money

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:29.280
You know, and I know a couple of months ahead of where we are, but we've got a little bit of surplus

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:34.880
So I wanted to pick a couple of projects that we're dependent on that sort of make

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:40.000
Ubuntu mate what it is that aren't part necessarily of of mate itself

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:44.640
And I was thinking about well, where will I you know, where will I look to support?

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:51.760
And then I got an email from um, marcos costales who's the developer for for two projects one is uh,

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:58.820
Gufw, which is the front end for the the uncomplicated firewall and he's also the developer for folder colors

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:02.660
Both of which i've integrated into mate

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:08.580
Gufw has been there since day one and folder colors. I added um, just a couple of weeks ago

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:14.740
And he sent me an email that basically said um, I really love the project. Um, uh, here

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:17.300
Here's how you do it

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:22.260
I really love the project. Um, uh here here's how you disable

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:27.780
The donation links in folder colors so it doesn't you know nag people

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.940
And i'm telling you this because I think the project's great and I really want to see it succeed

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:37.140
And I was like, well, there we go. There is the first person that we should reward

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:44.820
So, um, we went through the accounts and uh, we've donated 50 to g u f w

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:51.700
And then we've donated another 50 to folder colors and taking taken him up on his offer of disabling the

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:59.780
donation links in the in the folder colors, uh piece so that was a hundred dollars we've donated this month and also

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:06.260
we've got um when you download ubuntu mate through the ubuntu mate.org website, there's a

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:12.340
You know, could could you give us a download tip? It's not um, you have to fill it out

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:17.220
It's just there alongside the rest of the content and it suggests tip us two dollars

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:21.540
If everyone who downloaded ubuntu mate gave us two dollars

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:27.220
It would fund the full-time development of ubuntu mate and also the mate desktop

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:32.660
Um, and we've had quite a few people doing that. So from that i've been able to

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.100
um

01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:38.100
Give uh, thirty dollars to the mate desktop team this month as well

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:42.340
Nice yeah, I really like uh, that approach

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:47.220
Uh, in fact, I I was wondering if maybe down the road if maybe this might be something that takes off a little more

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:53.300
Because open source really does depend on uh, everybody that you're building on top of and everybody that sort of is riding on top of you

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:57.140
And uh, like uh, not only did I not really know about folder color

01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:59.700
Uh, but I by the way love that you integrated it

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.180
But uh now like hearing that backstory, too

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:05.700
That's just that's so awesome the way that the project worked together with you guys like that

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:09.300
Yeah, and I think that for a distribution it's easier to

01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.220
gather

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:18.100
Donations, I mean we talk about you know, um people wanting free software as in free of cost

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:23.380
But people are so generous, you know, we're asking we're not asking for anything

01:08:24.020 --> 01:08:30.020
We're gently encouraging them to give something but the the the money that's coming in is

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:35.140
Surprising quite frankly far far far more surprising than I I I realized

01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:42.820
And we can really do things with that. Um, and you know, uh, I I can't afford to make a hundred dollar donation

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.620
Uh as an individual

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:52.100
But using ubuntu mate as a platform to do that that actually makes a difference to the developer of that piece of software

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:56.740
That's uh, it's not gonna it's not gonna pay their wages or anything, you know grand like that

01:08:56.740 --> 01:09:02.420
It's it's still a small contribution, but it's much more than I can make as an individual. It seems sound

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:06.020
it seems like investing in the ecosystem and uh,

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:10.580
The other thing is it's made me kind of think about how I could apply something like that here

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:16.580
Um, and I don't know exactly how that would be but wouldn't it be interesting to take like if we if we had a milestone

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:23.300
Where if we reached a certain set amount of funding, uh, then we would contribute a percentage to maybe production linux software

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:30.580
Like video editors like, you know, or or uh, uh, audio editors or maybe other things like gstreamer or things like uh,

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:34.020
Ffmpeg or or vlc or or something like that

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:39.220
That's it gives me a lot to think about and I think a lot of projects could think about how they could apply it to uh,

01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:44.900
To their their kind of uh setup and and sort of reinvest in the tools that they use like

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:49.220
Jupiter broadcast, you know, we're freaking lives and dies on ffmpeg

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:53.540
Like if anybody deserves a buck from us, it would be at the ffmpeg project

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:55.380
I don't even know how their funding is set up

01:09:55.380 --> 01:10:00.260
but and the other thing is like I could imagine like so say down the road we did something like that where we set

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:04.900
Up a goal on our on our patreon.com today page where we said all right after this milestone

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:09.300
We're going to give we're going to give back to open source every month and then imagine like so I reach out and I get

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:12.500
I start, you know here ffmpeg project. I want to I would like to donate

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:16.020
Well, then maybe that starts a conversation with the project and then we land a great interview time

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:20.820
Well, then maybe that starts a conversation with the project and then we land a great interview too. Like there could be other types of

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:25.620
You know benefits to it too other than just yes quite

01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:28.740
And now you have a dialogue with these projects, right?

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.700
Well, this is it. This is it now now, uh

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:37.700
We have a relationship because now i've exchanged many emails with mark awesome. We've actually started talking about some

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:45.620
Um spin-off projects so it actually then you know garners some involvement in the project other than what i've already

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:52.020
Seen is out there. So this is a mechanism. I'm going to try and use going forward to actually

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:55.460
uh recognize the efforts that people have put into their

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:02.180
Applications and try and use it as a way to bring them into the the wider ruben tumato project

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:07.300
And uh and and reward them for you know, um what they've what they've achieved

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:11.380
So it will be in a small way and as your plan is as this happens to continue to

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:15.140
Post about it kind of are you going to do like an online? What's your what's your plan?

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:18.100
They're kind of making it sort of transparent for the community

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:19.460
Well, yeah

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:25.300
So when when I first tabled the idea of taking donations to pay for the community server

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:30.500
I set up front and I do this quite regularly if there's anything that i'm not sure about

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:36.820
I ask the community so it's very democratic. I put a poll out and I basically say vote on this

01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:42.260
How do you want things doing? So when I said, um, i'm going to open up for donations

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:49.460
How do you want the finances reported the result of that feedback was they wanted a monthly statement of accounts?

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:52.900
So that's what i've been doing since I think december time

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:59.140
So at the end of every month, I post a detailed list of these are all of the people that donated

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:02.980
This is the amount that came in. This is what the money was spent on

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:07.140
And how we've we've used it and I felt a little bit

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:09.540
Awkward about this

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:16.180
Last month or the month before because I spent some money on an ibook g4 that I bought off ebay

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.740
Because I wanted to work with one of the community members on the power pc port

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:26.420
And I was like, uh, you know 80 quid's quite a lot of money to spend on a second-hand computer

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:29.460
And I don't really know anything about power pc

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:35.540
But as a result, we now have power pc as an officially supported architecture

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:42.100
So I feel that that money was well spent and certainly for those people in the ubuntu marte community

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:45.700
That use power pc. They're super happy with that

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:50.660
uh, and I feel that you know, that was okay, it was okay to spend that money because there was a

01:12:51.860 --> 01:12:53.860
a measurable result

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:59.860
As a result as a result of spending that so this month i'm going to buy

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:02.340
a raspberry pi 2

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.420
And an odroid c1

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.900
And this is a precursor to

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.540
uh trying to achieve

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.920
Um v7 hard float images for 1510

01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:19.060
very nice and so 15, uh, but before we get to 1510 1504 is going to have

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:26.180
An official power pc edition. It's going to have one click compiz enablement for the desktop, right? I mean, this is fancy. Yeah

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:29.960
Yeah, so so some of the headline features for 1504

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:35.540
I've worked with the upstream compiz team. So i've i've

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:42.500
ported the integration layer to marte in compiz i've also ported the um,

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:48.180
um, uh the compatibility plugin, uh to marte as well. So now in

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:55.060
1504 uh, you'll see there's a proper marte compatibility plugin and then i've also added um,

01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:59.940
Detection of the marte session for compiz so it knows

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.740
Compiz knows it's running under marte

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:07.780
And these are the plugins and this is the profile that it should use because this is marte

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:14.820
It's not gnome and it's not unity. So we've got first class. Um compiz support and i've spent

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:17.200
many evenings

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:24.260
Tweaking a sort of a default marte compiz profile with the same set of defaults that give you

01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:31.140
Some nice transitions and some nice effects without being too sort of in your face and over the top

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:35.860
And uh, and i've just i've just sent another merger proposal

01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:41.140
Um, I think yesterday evening which has been accepted to just tighten that up a little bit

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:47.860
But as a result as a result of working on um on compiz I had to sign the uh,

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.560
ubuntu, um

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:52.500
Cla

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:59.140
So I was invited to sign the cla. Yeah, and i've i've read the small print very carefully and as I understand it

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:03.220
Every second tuesday, I have to go to poppy's house and wash his car

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:08.580
Yeah, and every and every and every last thursday of the month I have to cook him dinner or something

01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:11.940
And also I think you're also obligated to catch his chickens when they get out

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:17.940
Yeah, all right, and that too but but only if only if uh, the the day of the weekends and why

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:21.220
Well, everyone should be obliged to do this

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:29.380
Everyone should have to I I had one more thing. I wanted to talk to you about uh, uh wimpy and that is uh, i'm

01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:33.300
I'm, uh pushing the buttons right now. I just became a uh patron

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:40.100
Uh of the project. Yeah, so talk about this a little bit. So I the reason I want to talk about this too is because um,

01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:46.740
I I I suspect that this might be something more distributions pick up because to me it seems like a no-brainer

01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:51.700
Of course i'm using patreon and it's maybe more geared towards content creators in a sense, but uh,

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:55.300
People can go to patreon.com slash ubuntu underscore matey

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:59.060
And if you're already, uh one of the patrons of our network

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:02.500
Then your stuff's already set up is just really click one click button

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:07.460
And uh, they have 29 patrons right now making 174 a month for the distribution

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:13.700
And I wonder if the other projects like maybe elementary os couldn't go on something like this. How's it worked for you so far wimpy?

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:19.700
Well, it's it's effectively the patrons that have funded the community server

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:26.980
So all of the setup costs and the server and the month-to-month server hosting, but more importantly, uh, the bandwidth

01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.220
costs because um ubuntu matey

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:34.820
1404 and 1410 which are unofficial and therefore we're having to

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:41.940
Field the costs of delivering that for are being downloaded between 900 times and a thousand times a day

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:46.180
So that's a lot of bandwidth that we're having to fund

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:52.980
Yeah, so those those patrons are basically funding funding the distribution network

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:56.340
So without them, uh, it wouldn't have happened

01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:00.340
um, and I went down the patreon route because

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:06.580
Um, you you could do you know kickstarters and crowdfunding and you get a gob of money up front

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:14.820
But there's no longevity. You want sustainability. So yeah, so I I went for it might take longer to build up ahead of steam

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:20.980
But I want to know month to month like the project can support itself what I the reason why I think it's actually kind of

01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:24.100
Brilliant and yes, there's bounty source and there's other ways to do it

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:29.380
But the other thing that's kind of nice about it is it legitimately one-to-one translates to the interest in the community

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:36.180
So you can scale up your efforts and your investment as the community scales up their investment and it directly corresponds as they want

01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:39.460
More they'll fund more and then you can afford more or you can come to them and say okay

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:42.660
We can do this next thing and the the milestones allow you to say

01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:46.260
All right, once we reach this milestone, this is something the distribution can offer

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:50.500
Uh, you in fact, you need some new milestones in there as a matter of fact. Yeah, I do

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:52.820
And in fact, we don't listen to milestones are the worst part

01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:58.980
I have I have got some that i'm going to add but um, you talk about you know, the community want more

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:00.420
so at the moment

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:04.420
There's uh about four of us that are discussing some

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.740
merchandise team

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:13.860
Because what we're getting quite often now is people saying that they want stickers for their computers or they want mugs and t-shirts

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:18.980
and all of that good stuff, so we're just putting together a team to try and uh,

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:21.540
And fulfill that requirement

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:27.860
And again, there'll be a little bit of kickback which can go into the project which we can then use to do

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:33.080
You know the next thing and the next thing so hopefully it's a cycle of self-sustaining

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:36.200
Self-sustaining uh that we can we can start to generate

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:43.720
Well, i'm looking forward to 1504. I think uh, I think we'll have a review when it comes out because I think that's

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:45.720
I mean, I think already

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:50.680
Uh, the distribution is in my in my estimation seems to be one that's worth watching already

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:53.640
And that's a pretty I mean there's a lot of distributions that sort of uh,

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:58.600
That sort of hover in that kind of I mean, I don't mean to really put people down

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
and it's not really the same thing but

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.060
Uh mandriva a little bit just a little bit. I mean, I love me. I love mandriva. I love you guys

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:09.340
I'm a mandrake user back in the day. I was a draft club member

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:14.300
Uh, so I got the special repos. I mean seriously, I love it. So honestly, but

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:19.180
I actually just just talking in terms of sheer relevancy. I just wonder

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:21.420
um

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.380
well

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.380
Yes, it'll be interesting to see what happens. So

01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:33.200
So distro watch were refusing to list abuntu mate whilst it was unofficial and the day after we got our official status

01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:35.500
distro watch

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:39.020
Put up an abuntu mate page on distro watch

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:42.940
And that was a week ago and we're at number 23 now

01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:50.460
In a week, so I know they're hinky stats, but it's a it's an interesting barometer for you know

01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:53.680
Uh interest let's say yeah. Yeah

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.800
Uh, I I can I can there's other ways. I don't know. I've watched this stuff for a long time

01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.560
There's other ways you can gauge it. Yeah

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:07.040
And and it's the thing is now it's getting difficult to to follow the the downloads because now we're on the official canonical infrastructure

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:10.000
I can't track all the downloads. So I don't know

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:19.600
how popular 1504 is versus 1410 and you know 1404 so I start to lose some visibility the

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:24.560
There was a recent article on was it the register where they?

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.600
Yeah, the upcoming

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:33.920
The upcoming 1504 release and didn't he talk about the torrent stats or was that some?

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.560
Yeah, no, it was it was the register article. Are you familiar with the register? I think that's mainly

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.560
In the uk. Oh, yeah

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:48.480
Okay, so um, yeah, the register covered the 1404 beta releases and covered ubuntu mate and happened to remark that the

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:54.160
The the seed ratio for ubuntu mate was three times that of any other flavor. So

01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:59.520
That's kind of interesting. Yeah, it is. Yeah, look at the register doing a write-up on that

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:01.520
I'll link to that in the show notes as well

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:07.600
Um, so yeah, we've got some good stuff planned and the other the other new feature in 1504

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.600
That's probably worth mentioning is yes. You've got compass that you can turn on

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.920
uh with a

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.600
drop down menu

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:19.920
But the other thing i've been working on is the user interface switcher. Oh, yes

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:26.240
Okay, so this was something I had the idea about because the default mate, um

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:33.840
Um desktop arrangement isn't how I actually use the system. So I created a number of panel layouts that that suited me and also

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.040
Another podcaster who has a particular requirement for how they drive their machine

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:44.480
And I created these and they said what you should do is you should you know make a gooey so you can switch between these

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.960
So i've i've now made this so um

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:53.040
Effectively, you've got the you've got the mate default arrangement. You've got the open suzer

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:56.480
Uh desktop arrangement as was some years ago

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:01.680
And then something that looks broadly like um windows xp like

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:09.040
And then something that looks somewhat macos 10 like and that integrates with plank and what have you so

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:14.560
You can you can quickly switch your panel arrangement to single panel top or button

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:22.080
Uh with with docs and or not or dual dual panel and you can just cycle through them very quickly find one that

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:27.200
That broadly reflects how you want to run your system and then customize it from there

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.040
But uh, hopefully, um, it's just something a little bit different

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.760
and the uh, the

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.760
porting the

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:38.960
menu to the mate menu and setting up the uh,

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.000
The windows thing makes it kind of feel like a windows 7

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:45.440
Interface so people who want that could easily get that really quickly

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:51.680
Um, yes. Yeah, i've called that theme redmond as well in sort of, you know hat tip to uh to xp

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:58.080
Uh, so, you know what i'm gonna do, uh, i'm gonna just I think everybody should go check out the distro watch

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:00.960
Uh link because that's number 23 right now

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:06.080
Uh, and so I I just tweeted it out right now and uh, you can check it out

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.400
It's distro watch dot com slash ubuntu mate

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.320
Uh, and I think a lot of people like to learn about this distribution because it's pretty compelling you can hear

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:14.320
It's got a lot of cool features coming

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:18.720
So go check it out. Maybe go up a little bit further in the ranks and people check it out even more

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.440
Wimpy, that's a ton of stuff. So are you uh, not you're not pulling your hair out. You're doing okay

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:28.080
You're not about to uh, lose too much sleep or um go insane from all the workload

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:31.280
No, I am working two jobs at the moment

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:37.760
I'm effectively doing my day job and then i'm coming home and then doing another like full shift

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.520
Most most nights until sort of you know one two o'clock in the morning. So I am

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.520
I'm properly exhausted

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.640
um, I just need to get over the hump of

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:52.160
Fixing up for the the 1504 stuff

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:57.840
Hopefully be done in a week and then it should be a nice easy cruise in through

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:04.640
Beta 2 release candidate to final and uh, and in that period we can uh, we can start to

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:11.680
Look at the planning for 1510 and i've got some gsoc mentoring i'm planning at the moment as well

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:16.320
Wimpy, I tell you what. You almost make me want to switch away from arch that close too bad

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.760
I could just easily install matte

01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:22.960
Of course, you know what honestly is I miss all of the fine touches you're doing like the color like the file

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:29.120
Like you need to you need to like can you just can you make all that like a package that I could just install on arch?

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:31.680
uh, yeah

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.880
Yeah, no, no, you're a little busy. Yeah. No, no, I probably could it's just finding time

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:43.040
Um, some of it's there already to be honest with you other people are maintaining some of those packages. But yes, it's uh,

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:49.040
If I did that then I sort of dilute the the value. I know i'm to marta

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:53.840
And so you have to walk what I have to do is just watch everything cool you do and then just go try to rip

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.840
It off on my own desktop on my own

01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:02.880
The thing the thing i've been working hard on is the the the mate marta tweak and marta menu

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:07.520
And marta menu. Yeah, i've made those distro independent

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:13.220
So those were forked from the mint utilities and now they don't carry any specifics

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.680
For either ubuntu debian or mint. So those tools could be used on on any distro now

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.180
so

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:24.400
Technically you could get all of that one click goodiness

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:26.960
for compiz on

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:33.120
On arch and a couple of weekends ago. I did update the compiz packages for

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:38.080
For arch linux for marta users as well because I maintain those there as well

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:45.440
So, uh lots coming power pc support eventually arm support 1504 and even 1510 in the works

01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:52.960
Officially a flavor now of ubuntu and the patreon and the distro watch submission. We have links to all that stuff in the show notes

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:58.000
Thank you very much for taking such a keen interest in the project. It's been great to watch it wimpy

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:01.280
It's been a lot of been a lot of fun and uh, it's well it runs all my computers

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.520
I just signed up on the patreon because that's that's selfish interest for me. I need this to work

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:09.360
It's genuinely a great product just to that's the great part. I want to contribute

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:16.560
And and what you and what and what you get is the warm fuzzy feeling that if there's any money left over we'll find a

01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:21.360
A good candidate that's worthy of some funding. Um

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:26.000
That that directly benefits ubuntu marte and every month now

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.440
Uh, I plan to support an open source project through our um our funding campaign

01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.800
That's really cool. You keep it up as long as you can because that's a pretty neat deal

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:38.080
Uh, all right. Well, we'll probably wrap it up there

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:42.320
So, uh, did you know the linux unplugged show is live that all these people we just talked to they're not recorded

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:47.040
Well, they're recorded now that you're hearing them, but when i'm talking to them, they're live and you could talk to them

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:51.040
You could be one of the people we're talking to. Oh my gosh go to jblive.tv

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.940
We do this show on a tuesday at 2 p.m. Pacific go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:59.280
Slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone and don't forget if you can't be here live

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:02.400
But you still want to contribute because you know, you'll love us

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.360
We do have that subreddit over at linuxactionshow.reddit.com

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.000
We pull stuff in from there and we'd love to have that

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.320
You also have the irc you can participate in and you can always help out financially too at our patreon

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:16.160
Patreon.com slash today the money raised there goes to all of the network

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:22.800
And matt, you know, I think with linux fest around the horizon. I've already started thinking about spring now in summer

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.700
I'm thinking about doing an episode of the show around the barbecue

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.280
Nice, I should probably just focus on next week though. Tell you the truth

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.240
It's okay to have long-term goals, but you know your short-term ones can't lose focus, right?

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.600
Well matt have a great week and i'll talk to you next week

01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.000
In fact, uh, maybe if you swing your timing just right when you come down here on monday for your super secret mission

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.840
I'll have some barbecue just there's a possibility. Sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. All right, everybody. Thanks so much for this week's episode of linux unplugged

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.120
We'll see you right back here next week. And also we'll see on sunday. We're gonna do our production under linux episode finally

01:27:53.120 --> 01:28:12.340
So tune in for that. Thanks so much. See you next week. So

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.360
Oh

01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:34.800
Dang it. I was just uh, I was just reviewing uh poppy's contract and apparently we didn't dedicate enough time to ubuntu touch poppy

01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:39.280
How's the ubuntu, uh touch project going in the bq stuff all good?

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:46.000
I'm, sorry. I'm contractually not allowed to talk about that now. Oh, wow. Oh, wow

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:52.560
Shabang, huh? Okay, fine try to give you a chance to give us you gotta wash his truck if you want this to work out

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:57.360
Chris that's what's coming down to i was trying to give no, it's fine. It's really fine. Oh, it's good, huh?

01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.680
Okay, it's trying to give a bro. It's right. It's fine

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.840
Hey jb titles.com jb titles. Do you see um?

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:08.080
There was a photo that went past on google plus one of the people at the meizu

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:12.720
stand the meizu mx4 is one of the devices we're shipping soon and uh,

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:16.400
There was a couple of samsung executives hanging around the booth

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.640
Looking at the meizu phone running ubuntu, which was nice, you know, yeah, I want I want that phone, you know

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:27.360
If if tyson ever doesn't work out for them, you know, we'll be there for them with proper limits

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.960
There you go. Next time we're doing this show next week

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:38.240
the apple watch is going to be announced like whatever features it has are going to be established and the price and shipping date is

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.240
going to be announced and uh

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.800
I don't know like

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:47.280
Here I am like before and i'm still like thinking i'm still not

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.320
I I don't feel like they've sold me on why I want an apple watch

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:54.080
Although I don't feel like pebble ever sold me all I want a pebble and google never sold me

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:56.960
I want an android where exactly i'm still kind of in this area where

01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:03.440
So the thing I like about the new pebble is the fact that they're touting it as being more hackable and having

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:06.800
Um a connector on the back that you could attach

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:12.720
The watch to or attach the strap the band the band so the bands can have different sensors

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:15.760
It says it could be bands. Yeah, the bands could have sensors or they could be more batteries

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:21.280
Or you could just take the watch completely off your wrist and have that as the control unit for something else

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:24.640
Oh my gosh have all kinds of under stuff underneath it. It doesn't have to be

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:30.000
Things type gizmo. Yeah, exactly. But the thing that the thing that kills

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:37.760
Pebbles android and ios obviously i'm speaking from a perspective of someone who doesn't actually use android or ios anymore

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:42.480
I'm screwed. I can't use either of those. I have to buy into the apple ecosystem to use an

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:48.800
Uh the iwatch and I have to buy into the android ecosystem in order to use an android where watch so

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:53.760
You know i'm boned either way. I can't use either of them. Whereas pebble seems to be a bit more open

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.480
They're completely open source

01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:01.280
I think the future of the watch is on having something that just receives dummy information

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:05.360
Has a framework for displaying ui and the back end is always elsewhere

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:08.400
And this is for the stores an open protocol

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.960
You just enter in the story and you get options on the watch

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:15.280
This is what pebble is doing you can push a pebble app with their api and write no code

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.160
And people can choose to install it and it's amazing nice

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:22.320
But still you install it like what I really am. You install it to the watch

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:30.260
You know, that's exactly what i'm saying. You don't do anymore that the app exists actually on the store computer

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:35.920
Yes, it's on the apple store. You just you just say go and then it starts showing the information. There's no

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:40.720
Choice, you know, there's no setup for it. You just oh I want this to show up

01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.280
Someone's already put it together for me. You just say okay show it on my watch

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:49.520
I got over the watch thing when I was like 10 when I got a timex data link and I started programming it

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:55.040
It's a flashing screen the scratch flashing monitor and programming it that way

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:59.360
even though there was only programs that I could put and download to the phone via the

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:03.280
Sensor like the light sensor onto it. It was still pretty cool

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:08.400
I kind of got over that way back then the watches now aren't really attractive to me. So

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:17.120
So pebble have clearly got like first mover advantage because they were kind of first out the gate in this space

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:24.720
And with their e-ink displays and the battery life they've been able to offer something that they that is

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:31.840
Similar to the watch wearing experience that you would already have had, you know, because these other smart watches

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.320
They're trying too hard. Yeah

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:42.160
It's not about firmware updates it's about whether your watch will still tell the time at nine o'clock at night

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:48.560
So I don't know if you guys have seen this sony e-ink watch. It's not a smart watch per se in the same way

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:51.360
That you would call it but it takes basic bluetooth stuff

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:57.680
And the amazing thing is the whole thing is an e-ink display like the band itself and when you can go in like say

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I want I like this design band and you can just go and say I want this design band

01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:07.040
I want the phone the the the watch at the top to look like this and it's like you can do that

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:10.800
And I thought it was so cool. I was like that is the watch I want

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.800
And what is it running?

01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:19.040
It doesn't run anything. It's like it's kind of a dumb watch where it takes in some basic input. Yeah. Yeah

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.840
Oh my god, this pebble thing is cheap

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:36.320
I think I am on record saying that that is the business model to go on the show here. Okay. I've just backed it

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.400
Really? Are you gonna get a phone? Did you get a watch to go for the steal?

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:46.480
Yeah, you're just drunk on hot cross buns you poppy poppy. You should go for the steel while you still can

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.840
It's more posh. That's fine

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:54.720
I'm not much more expensive. It's so what are the I haven't actually looked at this

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.440
Only the steel does the cool bands

01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:04.400
Oh, really so they have uh, 68 000 backers wow 10 million dollars, so they're definitely funded

01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.600
Is this the right kickstarter? Am I which one do I look at? Yeah, you're on it. Yeah

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:11.360
You're right. I think they're going like an hour and a half or is that the original? How do I know?

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:17.360
I'm not looking at the oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, this is pebble time. This has the new watch no compromises. Yeah. Okay. All right

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:18.880
So here we go. This is

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:24.400
Yeah, uh, this is pretty cool. All right. I'm gonna play just a little bit of it. Hey kickstarter. My name is eric

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:30.560
I'm the founder of pebble. You may remember pebble from our first campaign when a bunch of you supported our quest

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.440
To build the world's first real smartwatch. I do remember that. Okay, so

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:41.040
Oh, okay, so you right when you jump in all the price levels are uh,

01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:47.840
Your choice of one pebble time steel, which includes your choice of color includes a leather strap an extra metal strap. Oh

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.520
Oh, I really want to do that

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:55.600
Hmm. Well, I don't know see this seems like it's hard to it's hard for me to gauge right now

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:59.760
Which is the wearable watch to go behind but seems like pebbles the one doesn't it?

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.680
At least for us maybe yeah

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.360
I think I want to back at you guys

01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:12.720
I have a really cool completely online, uh,

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.680
Development environment for it too. It's sweet

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:17.600
You can be as long as you're on the same network as your phone

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:21.680
You can just write code and push it right to your watch. I think I want to back it. Should I back it? I kind of

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:25.520
I want and then I could if I got oh gosh, I want one now. Oh, this is the steel

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:30.240
We're we're at a tipping point chris. There's there's there's two ways. This is going to go

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:36.720
When apple come out with their apple watch that will set the um,

01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:42.720
Direction for the wearables market if apple make a success out of it

01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:48.800
Everyone else will jump onto that ship firmly and if apple's wearables flop

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.360
it will be uh

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:58.640
A novelty that never really gains any traction and it will be the likes of pebble that own that space

01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.440
And it will be a relatively small market

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:07.520
So where do you want to be? Do you want to be either way pebble sounds like a safe bet? Yeah, I think so

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.800
I think I think well that you know, like I said, they've got a lot of different brands

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.760
I think I think well that you know, like I said, they've got first mover advantage

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:19.840
They're far more far further along than the others in actually delivering a wearable device

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.400
You know something that you can wear all day long that works

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:26.880
One of the better things about the pebble is that i've had mine for over a year now

01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.680
And I think only two or three people have ever been like, oh, is that a smartwatch?

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:33.200
It's just it just blends in. I don't think that these other devices are going to do that

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:39.600
The thing apple has is giant gobs of money

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:47.760
And yeah, and that that's something that pebble never has which is going to be hard to compete with and maybe they get the

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.840
hacker mentality

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:52.880
That you know people like us will play with it, but apple

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.760
will have uh

01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.760
premium stores and

01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:03.120
Lots of news airtime on all the mainstream channels as a result of them being apple

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:10.640
But here is the trick. It's open source, right mostly so at least so that means that any

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:16.000
Low-end store that looks at the high fees to do partnership with apple. It still wants a phone

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:21.520
A phone. Sorry a watch is probably going to do with the pebbles

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.160
especially

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.800
Yeah, the thing is the thing is is uh

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:32.880
Uh, all the the hackability and open source stuff is great for the likes of us that are discussing this now

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:38.480
But if I say to my wife i'm going to get one of these smartwatches and she's going to say to me one

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:42.960
And i'm like, well it can tell me all of the things that's on my phone and the time

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:46.400
She's going to say well, why don't you just look at your phone?

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.880
Yeah, and and this is this

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.280
This is how I feel about it

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:57.440
It's nothing you see the problem is these watches in overall have been

01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:00.960
Marketed as a device for a consumer to buy

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:06.480
I really think that these are devices for a store to offer to a customer to a member

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:11.620
But like that or a cheap one that is subsidized by these businesses

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:17.440
But for what what are you going to use it for? This is I haven't seen a compelling use case yet

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.600
I use my pandora

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.600
Or my

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:31.120
Membership card on the store. It gives you more information and to the store they win more precise information about your actual buying habit

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:37.600
But i've got nfc and my mobile phone. I already carry that everywhere. Why can't I do those things with my mobile phone?

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.160
It's great. This is remote without having to take your your phone out of your pocket

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:48.000
But my phone is out of my pocket. I'm sitting down. So why is that? Why is that compelling?

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
What so how big is your phone?

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:55.220
Uh, that's that's my like everyone that I see as these huge ginormous

01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:02.320
Fablets, I'm gonna call them. Yeah. Yeah, i've I've I had a note too and today i've just replaced it with a nexus 6

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:09.840
So I I got I have the firefox west flame is my my my main phone and it's already to the point where it's like

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:16.960
This is kind of large and I don't want anything bigger than this and yet I can't buy anything smaller than that now

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:18.960
So it's it's honestly

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:24.640
You could buy an abuntu phone. Yeah about the same size as the firefox flame

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:31.680
I'm, actually I have both in my hand right now the firefox flame and the bq phone and they are pretty much identical size

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:35.520
Pebble is nice when I get an email notification and my phone's in the other room

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:38.640
But I can hear it and I can see the email and know that it's not worth getting up for

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.480
Yeah, when I want to skip a song that's playing and I don't want to unlock my phone and deal with getting into the app

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.920
To skip a song

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.920
on

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.460
Okay, so the song skipping if if you put yourself in an environment where that's more convenient

01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:56.320
Because it's on your wrist like for example

01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:58.400
If you're cycling for example

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:04.880
And you've got your phone in a backpack and you've got your headphones in and your watch is on your wrist and you're cycling along

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:11.200
You can be measuring your distance and velocity and all of that good stuff and you can skip tracks

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:14.900
You I can see a use case for a smartwatch

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:22.800
But you have to kind of think really hard and you can't see that most people are going to get value out of

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360
a device like that

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.360
This is if you're an upper class businessman

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:31.120
You're sitting in a really important meeting and your phone's on silent, but your wish is you know

01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:33.120
Giving you a buzz that your wife is calling you

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:39.680
Upper class businessman doesn't know how to use his phone or his computer and therefore he won't know how to use his smartwatch either

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:41.680
No

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:48.000
Way of saying other end of conversation would be look at your watch now when you look at your watch

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
You're gonna think you're looking at facebook

01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:54.880
Well, it's true I do sometimes that's that's the other thing

01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:01.200
Your guys are thinking about okay. Why I as a consumer will acquire a watch

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.960
That's why i'm saying the future of these watches is not on you acquiring it

01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:12.080
It's in the companies that want the information from you will give it to you and then you're gonna start using some of these

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:16.160
Uh leverage I don't understand this approach because the watch doesn't collect any data

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:20.160
Oh, so this is the beauty of it once you are inside the store

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:26.000
Usually they have patterns on on okay what things you decided to pay on the cash, right?

01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:31.520
On the cashier right with your membership card for you to get the discount. That's why they apply the discounts

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:38.480
Okay, what about extra information on a product based on you closing your watch to the divide to the product?

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:41.760
You take the watch doesn't do any sort of communication like that

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:45.280
Well, I guess are you envisioning like these stores like the watches will get so cheap

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:48.880
These stores will have like a branded watch. They give you as part of the membership program

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.880
That or they will collaborate in a pool of companies and they will have a system

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:57.600
And so you have a single membership card

01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:03.760
And when you are inside of one specific store you get the system of that specific store when you're inside of another store

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:28.160
You get the specific of that other store and then they can share the cost of producing these watches
