00:00.000 --> 00:04.700
Let's see, Dan, just before you go, will you say welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly

00:04.700 --> 00:06.440
Linux talk show?

00:06.440 --> 00:10.900
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show, dude.

00:10.900 --> 00:28.200
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 236 for February 13th, 2018.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.400
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's reporting back from the front

00:32.400 --> 00:34.260
lines of the desktop.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.260
My name is Chris.

00:35.260 --> 00:36.260
My name is Wes.

00:36.260 --> 00:37.260
Hello, Wes.

00:37.260 --> 00:38.720
I'm very excited about today's show.

00:38.720 --> 00:39.840
We've got a ton of great stuff.

00:39.840 --> 00:40.840
We do.

00:40.840 --> 00:41.840
We do.

00:41.840 --> 00:45.400
We have some follow-up items that are quite choice if you had an opportunity to listen

00:45.400 --> 00:50.880
to 235, but there's a big embarrassing story for Apple this week, and us open source enthusiasts

00:50.880 --> 00:53.000
can't help but laugh a little bit.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.160
Turns out Razer, not so interested in supporting Linux after all, maybe put off those plans

00:58.160 --> 01:02.560
for a laptop, but KDE's got you covered with a new slim book, too.

01:02.560 --> 01:10.360
We'll take a look at that, and then Mr. Foray is here, Mr. Foray from the esteemed elementary

01:10.360 --> 01:18.640
OS project to tell us about why the hell they're jumping from 0.4 to 5.0.

01:18.640 --> 01:19.640
What kind of gumption?

01:19.640 --> 01:20.640
A whole new world.

01:20.640 --> 01:26.980
We're going to figure that out, plus last Friday, since we gathered here together, I

01:26.980 --> 01:28.680
went down to Microsoft.

01:28.680 --> 01:35.520
I visited the third floor of one of the swankiest offices I've ever been in, and I asked them

01:35.520 --> 01:41.280
all of the questions, everything from literally, are you trying to kill Ubuntu, to why the

01:41.280 --> 01:44.720
hell are you open sourcing.NET Core and PowerShell?

01:44.720 --> 01:45.720
Wow.

01:45.720 --> 01:46.720
Yeah.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.160
And they just let me ask whatever question I want.

01:48.160 --> 01:51.800
I'm going to play some of that for you here on the show, talk about Azure and Linux and

01:51.800 --> 01:57.640
about where that's going, and the super awkward position that it seems Microsoft has found

01:57.640 --> 02:02.920
themselves in with Windows, plus we will talk about our plasma challenge.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.960
We'll do a little check-in on the plasma challenge and see where everybody's at, see who's moving

02:06.960 --> 02:09.120
on, see who's sticking around.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.040
There's tons coming up, so let's not go a moment further without saying holler at our

02:13.040 --> 02:26.560
mumble room, time-appropriate greetings, virtual lug, hip-hip.

02:26.560 --> 02:31.280
All right, guys, well, we have so much to get into this week, and I have it all opened

02:31.280 --> 02:33.360
up in a tab on Firefox.

02:33.360 --> 02:38.720
This is like, by the way, just totally random, but I don't know, I'm like week four into

02:38.720 --> 02:40.760
Firefox now, version 58 right now.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.440
I never thought I'd hear you say it.

02:42.440 --> 02:46.680
I mean, this is like the third or fourth unplugged with no Chrome.

02:46.680 --> 02:47.680
No Chrome.

02:47.680 --> 02:48.680
How's it going?

02:48.680 --> 02:49.680
I mean, you're still here.

02:49.680 --> 02:50.680
You don't seem to be pulling your hair out.

02:50.680 --> 02:54.000
I think my favorite feature is how Firefox restores tabs.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.520
Instead of opening a new window and then populating that window with all of these random-ass tabs,

02:59.520 --> 03:03.560
it just resumes all of the tabs in the window that I have open.

03:03.560 --> 03:07.640
The reason why I like that is because I can do it while my browser is on camera, and you

03:07.640 --> 03:11.800
have no idea I just did that, just all silently in the background without lagging out my browser,

03:11.800 --> 03:12.800
without lagging out my OS.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.400
Poor broadcaster's tip for you.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.400
I know.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.400
And my battery life's way better too.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.040
Anyways, totally random.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.480
And also random this week, I thought we'd start with kind of an embarrassing story for

03:21.480 --> 03:22.480
Apple.

03:22.480 --> 03:26.440
They had some forced open source disclosure this week.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.480
Did you see this?

03:27.480 --> 03:30.280
The iBoot firmware, yeah, they call it iBoot.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.080
Of course.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.080
What else would you call it?

03:33.080 --> 03:37.720
I don't know, anything but iBoot, to be honest with you, anything, actually, but iBoot would

03:37.720 --> 03:38.720
be what I'd call it.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.360
Well, uBoot was taken, so.

03:41.360 --> 03:47.960
But it sounds like an intern or somebody at the level of an intern posted Apple's super

03:47.960 --> 03:54.080
secret firmware source code onto GitHub for whatever reason.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.760
They like the jail cell.

03:55.760 --> 04:03.080
And within hours, within about a day or so, Apple got a DMCA complaint filed with the

04:03.080 --> 04:04.880
GitHub company.

04:04.880 --> 04:09.120
But it's sort of like no going back on this kind of thing.

04:09.120 --> 04:12.040
Once this thing is out there, there's really no taking it back.

04:12.040 --> 04:16.240
And you've got to wonder if maybe jailbreakers and hackers can use this stuff.

04:16.240 --> 04:22.680
And what's weird is Apple's statement, Apple responded with a comment, something about,

04:22.680 --> 04:27.000
we do not rely on the obscurity of our source code to enforce its security.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Oh.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Yeah, like one of those, boom.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.240
We were just happy to have it as a layer there for a while.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.240
Yeah.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.240
For as long as we could.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.560
Yeah, it sounded like the person involved was pressured from some of the community that

04:37.560 --> 04:42.080
wanted the information about how to develop jailbreakers and other such applications.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.080
Yeah.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.080
I-Boot.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.080
And then it's leaked further than that.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.960
It's a second stage bootloader, Wes.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.560
It's just so, I don't know.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.920
There's something about all of Apple's stuff.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.760
You got the Secure Enclave.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.760
You got the I-Boot.

04:53.760 --> 04:57.320
You got the T2 chip in the iMac Pro.

04:57.320 --> 05:04.000
It really feels like Apple is circling in on jailbreakers and the Hackintosh community

05:04.000 --> 05:08.240
just to give them the old traditional Apple butt wiener in about another year.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.840
All of the things are lining up right now.

05:10.840 --> 05:15.040
The T2 chip is going to be something that will undoubtedly ship in new MacBook Pros

05:15.040 --> 05:21.880
and the new Mac Pro, and that is literally a iPhone system on a chip that verifies the

05:21.880 --> 05:24.440
cryptographic integrity of the Mac operating system.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.920
I mean, that's where their heart's been for a long time now.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.640
There's no way the Hackintosh community is going to have a quick remedy to that.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.960
That's going to be easy for anybody.

05:33.960 --> 05:38.080
And that's just going to populate across all of the Mac platform.

05:38.080 --> 05:43.560
And then you combine it with all of the other techniques that they're doing, like with signing

05:43.560 --> 05:46.480
of applications and the Mac App Store.

05:46.480 --> 05:51.080
It's just the Hackintosh community can't have more than two years.

05:51.080 --> 05:56.720
I don't think you're wrong, and a lot of this is in the name of security, and a lot of it

05:56.720 --> 05:57.720
can really be understood.

05:57.720 --> 05:58.720
Yeah.

05:58.720 --> 05:59.720
Yeah.

05:59.720 --> 06:00.720
Honestly, it-

06:00.720 --> 06:06.200
I don't think that some of this actually does solve, but from our perspective as the 1%

06:06.200 --> 06:08.040
techie crowd, it's not.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.040
But okay.

06:09.040 --> 06:13.480
But put yourself in the position of maybe you're one of these companies that's really

06:13.480 --> 06:18.120
buddy-buddy with IBM, and IBM now preaches the gospel of Apple, and they come in and

06:18.120 --> 06:23.480
they say, replace all of your Windows 7 and Windows XP machines with iPads and MacBooks.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.160
I already did that.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.160
It's fine.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.160
It's easy.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.160
Okay, sorry.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.000
That's just so funny.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.640
What are you going to do?

06:33.640 --> 06:39.160
Anyways, so you go in there, you replace all your machines with Macs, because that's cheap,

06:39.160 --> 06:43.840
and then you really want to get to the point where you can verify that the operating system

06:43.840 --> 06:48.060
is secure, and the applications are secure, and so it's kind of within the corporation's

06:48.060 --> 06:50.600
best interest that Apple does lock this shit down.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.600
Yeah.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.740
I mean, absolutely, right?

06:52.740 --> 06:55.920
You could even say the Hackintosh community isn't even a factor in their decision-making

06:55.920 --> 06:56.920
process.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.640
They're not, yeah, they're not large.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.640
Why would it be?

06:59.640 --> 07:03.740
I think it's really just been a, perhaps Apple being nice or not overly, you know, not really

07:03.740 --> 07:05.240
caring about it up to this point.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.560
But if it gets in the way of some of their security and marketing objectives, then they

07:08.560 --> 07:10.720
really have no reason to let them benefit.

07:10.720 --> 07:14.120
I wonder if we could figure out, like wouldn't it be amazing if somebody could figure out

07:14.120 --> 07:20.320
like, well, it's going to be one in 15 Hackintosh users become desktop Linux users or something

07:20.320 --> 07:21.320
like that?

07:21.320 --> 07:22.320
That would be.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.160
Anyways, here's kind of a fun thing about Apple using the DMCA to take down the code

07:26.160 --> 07:28.540
off of GitHub.

07:28.540 --> 07:34.040
Under penalty of perjury, that on the case of Apple, that means that the source code

07:34.040 --> 07:35.160
has to be legit.

07:35.160 --> 07:39.160
Because if Apple is using the DMCA to take down that source code, and then they go to

07:39.160 --> 07:43.560
court over it, and it turns out it's not legitimately their source code, they're screwed.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.680
In other words, that means the source code that now tons and tons and tons and tons of

07:46.680 --> 07:51.800
people have copies of is legitimate source code, because they use the DMCA, which confirms

07:51.800 --> 07:55.000
it's legitimate, which is...

07:55.000 --> 07:56.120
It's funny how that kind of works, right?

07:56.120 --> 07:57.680
You're really enjoying yourself on this one.

07:57.680 --> 07:58.680
I am.

07:58.680 --> 07:59.680
It's nice to see you happy.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.680
Thank you.

08:00.680 --> 08:01.680
Thank you.

08:01.680 --> 08:06.560
Because, you know, then I reflect on another laptop company like Razer, who was offered

08:06.560 --> 08:11.920
the source code to update firmwares on Razer laptops, and they said, no, thanks.

08:11.920 --> 08:16.160
This is, of course, by one of the folks involved with the Linux vendor firmware project where

08:16.160 --> 08:20.200
they are shipping firmware updates via GNOME software and other mechanisms.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.440
We've talked about it a lot on this show, one of my favorite things.

08:23.440 --> 08:24.440
Absolutely.

08:24.440 --> 08:29.000
And also, one of the developers emailed Razer and said, what could I do to help you start

08:29.000 --> 08:31.600
shipping your firmware updates?

08:31.600 --> 08:36.560
How about I will write you code from scratch, example code that you could actually just

08:36.560 --> 08:38.680
take and use that would be ready to go.

08:38.680 --> 08:43.080
In fact, how about I do all of the work, I hook everything up for you, you just got to

08:43.080 --> 08:47.160
give me some of the details and it's good to go.

08:47.160 --> 08:51.080
And nothing happens.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.560
And nothing happens.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.840
And then eventually, an email comes back and the email says, we've discussed your offer

08:56.840 --> 09:02.960
with a dedicated team and we're thankful for your enthusiasm and for the good idea.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.160
But I'm afraid I also have to let you know that at this moment in time, our support for

09:07.160 --> 09:12.600
software is only focused on Windows and Mac, i.e. you've done all the hard work, you've

09:12.600 --> 09:17.680
gotten everything ready for us, you're actually even solving a problem for us and some of

09:17.680 --> 09:23.800
our customers, but we can't be bothered to give you the time of day.

09:23.800 --> 09:29.320
I've got an alternative point of view on this.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.120
I'd love to hear it.

09:31.120 --> 09:44.160
So OEMs such as Razer who go to OEMs may have to enter into contracts, which prevents the

09:44.160 --> 09:48.800
redistribution of firmware and BIOS images.

09:48.800 --> 09:56.320
And this may be a well-crafted polite reply to rebuttal the fact that they don't have

09:56.320 --> 10:02.800
an arrangement with their ODM that enables them to redistribute the firmware images.

10:02.800 --> 10:07.520
So you're saying it's a way of answering the question without kind of crapping on their

10:07.520 --> 10:11.000
partner saying, well, our partner's agreement doesn't allow us to do that.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Exactly.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Yeah.

10:13.000 --> 10:20.080
So I don't know, I don't have any insight into who Razer's ODMs are, but some of the

10:20.080 --> 10:29.520
other Linux-focused OEMs certainly do fall into this category where they are not permitted

10:29.520 --> 10:36.720
to redistribute these images and consequently doing this work is not open to them.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.720
Right.

10:37.720 --> 10:42.560
So to be clear, to sort of clarify what you're saying is based on your experience and my

10:42.560 --> 10:50.640
experience in communicating with certain Linux-first hardware vendors that are reshipping upstream

10:50.640 --> 10:57.080
original equipment manufacturers' hardware like perhaps say a Clevo, there is an agreement

10:57.080 --> 11:00.880
in place in which as part of that – because it's been around – these have been around

11:00.880 --> 11:06.520
for years now, that part of that agreement is you cannot directly redistribute our firmwares

11:06.520 --> 11:11.800
to your – or any kind of like updates to the firmware too to your customers.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.740
They have to be distributed directly from us.

11:13.740 --> 11:16.760
And then there's different iterations of this agreement that might say, well, under

11:16.760 --> 11:21.340
these conditions you can distribute firmware or under these other conditions you can distribute

11:21.340 --> 11:23.280
the firmware once we've signed off on it.

11:23.280 --> 11:28.480
There's a bunch of changes to it, but that's essentially what you're saying.

11:28.480 --> 11:35.880
Exactly that because if you enter into an agreement with say Clevo and as the equipment

11:35.880 --> 11:45.240
manufacturer you are requesting some customizations to buy us some firmware, those are not something

11:45.240 --> 11:51.440
that Clevo want to be reshared and redistributed because it's specific to your contractual

11:51.440 --> 11:52.440
obligations.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.440
Right.

11:53.440 --> 11:58.940
And the customization of that firmware is sort of the product that they are – part

11:58.940 --> 12:02.680
of the product that they are selling back to the reseller.

12:02.680 --> 12:09.160
So Clevo is going into some sort of business arrangement with these resellers and saying,

12:09.160 --> 12:10.520
all right, we will make these changes.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.660
You go validate this on your hardware and then come back to us with the changes you

12:13.660 --> 12:18.680
want and then Clevo makes the changes at the firmware level and then the seller tests that

12:18.680 --> 12:23.320
again and validates it and sends back more suggestions and it's a back and forth process.

12:23.320 --> 12:29.040
And then eventually they have a custom firmware that Clevo has created for that particular

12:29.040 --> 12:30.040
vendor.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.800
And that's part of the value that Clevo offers.

12:32.800 --> 12:33.800
Exactly.

12:33.800 --> 12:40.440
And this is also why you sometimes see that the Linux device manufacturers are a little

12:40.440 --> 12:47.600
bit behind on offering certain chipsets of products because they have to go through this

12:47.600 --> 12:53.840
validation and tweaking and customization exercise for their products in order to deliver

12:53.840 --> 12:57.160
them in an out-of-the-box Linux compatible way.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.160
Yeah.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.160
Okay.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.160
Yeah.

13:00.160 --> 13:01.160
Unfortunate but reasonable.

13:01.160 --> 13:08.080
So one of the devices that is probably kind of along the same line that I at first was

13:08.080 --> 13:12.460
sort of skeptical of but now we're seeing a second iteration of and I'm kind of starting

13:12.460 --> 13:19.200
to get it now is the KDE Slimbook and now we have the KDE Slimbook 2.

13:19.200 --> 13:22.600
And it's not like it's going to like blow you away with the hardware specs.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.120
It's a 13.3-inch screen.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.560
It does have an SSD.

13:26.560 --> 13:33.880
You can get it with a pretty fast 2.7 gigahertz i7 CPU which will turbo boost up to 3.5 gigahertz.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.640
And you can get up to 16 gigs of RAM.

13:37.640 --> 13:41.880
But again, it's not going to blow you away in terms of performance.

13:41.880 --> 13:46.280
But it is one of these situations where it's...

13:46.280 --> 13:50.760
How do you describe something like this, Wes, where a project can focus in on a singular

13:50.760 --> 13:51.760
target?

13:51.760 --> 13:55.560
It's not like they're designing the hardware but it gives them sort of like a...

13:55.560 --> 13:57.920
They have like a reference platform they can really focus on.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.120
Yeah, like a narrow set of variables, right?

14:00.120 --> 14:01.120
Yes.

14:01.120 --> 14:04.880
And that's what's interesting about the Slimbook is because I feel like this could be a harbinger

14:04.880 --> 14:10.600
for what we could see down the road as it becomes more available for people to ship

14:10.600 --> 14:15.440
upstream OEM hardware, make slight modifications at the hardware and firmware level and then

14:15.440 --> 14:20.600
have open source projects hyper-target that for a few months in development and then release

14:20.600 --> 14:21.600
it.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.600
And that's what we're seeing here.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.280
We're seeing this with some other hardware.

14:24.280 --> 14:28.960
And I think this is an interesting idea because when I first started getting into Linux, you

14:28.960 --> 14:34.760
would buy like a six CD set for $65.

14:34.760 --> 14:39.360
You'd go home with a box and a book and like a whole bunch of CDs where you can install

14:39.360 --> 14:40.360
your Linux.

14:40.360 --> 14:43.120
And that was the thing you bought.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.280
But that's obviously gone away with ISO downloads and whatnot.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.980
But this is almost like a new version of it today.

14:48.980 --> 14:54.360
If I was a student and I was really passionate about Linux and open source and the Plasma

14:54.360 --> 14:59.000
desktop, I'm pretty sure I would aspire to a piece of hardware like this.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.560
This would be sort of that thing that I would want to get.

15:02.560 --> 15:06.560
I would go mow those lawns, I would do what it would take, I would go get that side job

15:06.560 --> 15:09.760
so that way I could get the perfect Plasma desktop laptop.

15:09.760 --> 15:14.240
It's been tweaked for it, designed for it, thought about, cared for.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.240
So it's nice to see.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.240
Go ahead.

15:16.240 --> 15:21.240
You told us with the previous conversation about working with ODMs in order to make the

15:21.240 --> 15:28.680
necessary customizations that the device that ships out of the box works with the distribution

15:28.680 --> 15:32.640
or operating system that isn't pre-installed.

15:32.640 --> 15:39.960
So I'm a big fan of this because this is the step change that Linux on the desktop needs.

15:39.960 --> 15:44.240
Downloading ISOs and sticking them on USB sticks and installing them on whatever you

15:44.240 --> 15:48.200
happen to buy is all very well and good.

15:48.200 --> 15:54.520
But actually being able to buy devices pre-installed, pre-configured, with the operating system

15:54.520 --> 16:00.160
that you want to use, that's how you really step up adoption.

16:00.160 --> 16:05.720
It also interests me the tighter coupling between the desktop maker and the actual hardware

16:05.720 --> 16:10.260
details and not having one layer of distributor or system in the middle there.

16:10.260 --> 16:14.720
Maybe there's some real-world concerns that will get addressed more quickly.

16:14.720 --> 16:20.160
It's funny and this could just be Softpedia, but in the screenshots on Softpedia, I'm seeing

16:20.160 --> 16:24.080
screenshots of elementary OS and home desktop.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.920
Oh, and there's Mate right there.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.400
There's even Unity below.

16:29.400 --> 16:33.360
The Slimbook guys are very good.

16:33.360 --> 16:40.640
While they have a specific model that's available with KDE, they support all of the things.

16:40.640 --> 16:41.640
Of course.

16:41.640 --> 16:42.640
Of course.

16:42.640 --> 16:45.480
And that's what's kind of nice when you're buying a Slimbook to run Plasma, but you know

16:45.480 --> 16:46.480
you can run everything else.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.480
It's all just Linux.

16:47.480 --> 16:48.480
It is, right?

16:48.480 --> 16:52.240
You can also buy a Slimbook without Plasma if you want to.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.680
Before we move on, producer Michael, do you have anything else you want to mention about

16:54.680 --> 16:55.680
the Slimbook thing?

16:55.680 --> 16:58.720
Because I've just sort of covered on a high level, but I don't know if you've ever seen

16:58.720 --> 17:03.560
someone in person, but with the version 2, it kind of feels like it's essentially like

17:03.560 --> 17:04.560
a Galago.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.560
Am I right about that?

17:05.560 --> 17:08.640
It's not the same ODM, but it is very similar.

17:08.640 --> 17:09.640
Oh, it's not?

17:09.640 --> 17:10.640
It's not?

17:10.640 --> 17:11.640
I don't think they have Cleveland now.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.120
Oh, it looks pretty nice though.

17:14.120 --> 17:20.360
We were fortunate enough that they were at, sorry, sorry, Slimbook were at UbuCon Europe

17:20.360 --> 17:26.960
in Paris in September last year and they had all of their devices out and there was lots

17:26.960 --> 17:33.600
of drooling and pouring at the quality of their devices.

17:33.600 --> 17:39.160
I think this version 2 looks particularly interesting.

17:39.160 --> 17:45.680
Just to plug another podcast, if curry happens, which it might, I would desperately love to

17:45.680 --> 17:49.680
see one of these in for review on the Ubuntu podcast with KD Neon.

17:49.680 --> 17:50.680
Me too.

17:50.680 --> 17:51.680
Me too.

17:51.680 --> 17:52.680
I would like to see that.

17:52.680 --> 17:53.840
It's a sick looking laptop.

17:53.840 --> 17:59.840
It reminds me of Macs, but you know, Macs have decent looking hardware and this one

17:59.840 --> 18:05.400
looks like you can get a better powerful machine roughly about the same price and still looks

18:05.400 --> 18:06.400
like a Mac.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.400
So hey, there you go.

18:07.400 --> 18:15.480
Now, do you have any idea, Rodden, about how much might go up towards the Plasma desktop

18:15.480 --> 18:16.660
or the KDE project?

18:16.660 --> 18:20.680
Is there any kind of like, is it just, is there any, do you know if there's any financial

18:20.680 --> 18:24.200
like contribution, am I giving anything towards the project?

18:24.200 --> 18:25.200
There is a partnership.

18:25.200 --> 18:29.080
I don't know what the percentages are, but I do know that they do something with it.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.360
I could find out, but I don't know if they'll pan.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.360
Yeah.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.360
All right.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.880
I just think this would probably be just be great for anybody that just wants a machine

18:35.880 --> 18:39.360
dedicated to run KD Neon, just go for it.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.560
And it looks like great hardware.

18:40.560 --> 18:44.000
I do hope to one day see my hands on it, maybe at a conference or something like that or

18:44.000 --> 18:49.280
if they ever have enough units to send out for review, I think that'd be pretty sweet.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.040
I'm still shopping for you, Wes.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.040
I'm still shopping.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.040
That's right.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.040
You are.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.040
You have like a first gen XPS 13.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.040
Is that a first gen?

18:56.040 --> 18:57.040
No, it's a second gen.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.040
Second gen.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.040
Second gen.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.040
All right.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.040
Well, that's understandable.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.040
Is that an i5 or an i7?

19:02.040 --> 19:03.040
i5.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.040
An i5, huh?

19:04.040 --> 19:05.040
Man.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.800
I mean, it's really just a terminal and a web browser.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.880
Yeah, but you get a shit ton of work done with that.

19:08.880 --> 19:09.880
That's not your daily driver.

19:09.880 --> 19:10.880
No, it is not.

19:10.880 --> 19:11.880
Okay.

19:11.880 --> 19:12.880
So your daily driver is a desktop?

19:12.880 --> 19:13.880
Yeah.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.000
I have a desktop replacement at home and a real desktop.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.960
So like a big laptop at home and then a desktop at work.

19:20.960 --> 19:21.960
Yeah.

19:21.960 --> 19:22.960
Okay.

19:22.960 --> 19:23.960
All right.

19:23.960 --> 19:24.960
And then this is the portable version.

19:24.960 --> 19:25.960
Good man.

19:25.960 --> 19:26.960
But you're right.

19:26.960 --> 19:27.960
It does need replacing.

19:27.960 --> 19:28.960
A little bit.

19:28.960 --> 19:29.960
So I'm shopping for you all the time.

19:29.960 --> 19:30.960
I'm just always looking for you.

19:30.960 --> 19:31.960
I just got to make sure you get the right thing, Wes.

19:31.960 --> 19:32.960
I got to make sure.

19:32.960 --> 19:33.960
It's got to be right.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.440
The only reason is because I got to sit here and stare at it every single week.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.440
Exactly.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.440
You have incentive.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.440
Yeah.

19:38.440 --> 19:39.440
You know what else?

19:39.440 --> 19:41.720
I'm going to mention Ting right now, linux.ting.com.

19:41.720 --> 19:42.720
It's our mobile service provider.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.500
It's the whole network's mobile service provider.

19:44.500 --> 19:49.360
It's just a smarter way to do mobile because your average Ting bill is just $23 per phone

19:49.360 --> 19:50.360
per month.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.800
It's pay for what you use wireless.

19:52.800 --> 19:57.840
However much you talk, however much you text, and however much data you use.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.560
You're like a ninja with this stuff too, Wes.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.560
You know that?

20:00.560 --> 20:01.560
Oh yeah.

20:01.560 --> 20:02.560
As much as you want.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.560
I've noticed that too.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.240
Like when Wes gets here, he's like, hey, what's the Wi-Fi?

20:05.240 --> 20:06.280
I got to get on the Wi-Fi here.

20:06.280 --> 20:07.280
I'm like, what's going on over there?

20:07.280 --> 20:10.920
I look over at Wes and then boom, he like syncs up all his stuff once he gets on the

20:10.920 --> 20:11.920
Wi-Fi.

20:11.920 --> 20:12.920
I'm not an animal.

20:12.920 --> 20:13.920
I mean, come on.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.000
I'm a gentleman Wi-Fi caller.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.680
They got nationwide coverage, CDMA and GSM networks, no contracts nor the termination

20:19.680 --> 20:22.480
fee, and you can try Ting totally risk free.

20:22.480 --> 20:26.820
With CDMA and GSM too, that means there's lots you can bring over in terms of hardware

20:26.820 --> 20:27.820
to the Ting network.

20:27.820 --> 20:28.820
It's incredible.

20:28.820 --> 20:34.160
You know, I went from paying over $140 a month to paying around $40 a month.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.400
That means I can buy like a new laptop every couple of years.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.600
It's super great.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.600
Start by going to linux.ting.com.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.840
Support this show.

20:41.840 --> 20:47.080
Make $25 off a Ting device or get $25 in service credit if you bring a device.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.340
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting.

20:50.340 --> 20:56.800
Big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the unplugged program, linux.ting.com.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.900
I just think Dan just can't stay out of the news.

20:59.900 --> 21:05.840
Elementary OS every single damn week is doing something that's causing some bit of discussion.

21:05.840 --> 21:09.300
And maybe this is just what happens when a project gets to a certain size.

21:09.300 --> 21:13.240
Like every single thing they do generates discussion.

21:13.240 --> 21:20.800
But Dan joins us this week to discuss the crazy, outlandish idea that they dare go from

21:20.800 --> 21:26.840
version 0.4 to version 5.0 with the next release, Version Journal.

21:26.840 --> 21:27.840
That's a big jump.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.760
So Dan, you've just gone off the deep end and you just jump in numbers like OpenSUSE

21:31.760 --> 21:32.760
now.

21:32.760 --> 21:33.760
Yeah.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.400
So, I mean, when we're just thinking about, you know, what if we took that zero and then

21:37.400 --> 21:40.800
took it off, then didn't do that.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.800
What if we didn't do that?

21:41.800 --> 21:42.800
Oh, well.

21:42.800 --> 21:43.800
All right.

21:43.800 --> 21:44.800
That sounds good.

21:44.800 --> 21:45.800
Moving on then.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.800
Bold thinking, Dan.

21:48.800 --> 21:53.720
Now, honestly, there's kind of two reasons, right?

21:53.720 --> 21:59.400
One is a marketing reason and one is kind of an organizational reason.

21:59.400 --> 22:03.840
And we kept getting a lot of people saying, oh, you know, when is Elementary OS going

22:03.840 --> 22:04.840
to get out of beta?

22:04.840 --> 22:05.840
Like, you guys are still in beta.

22:05.840 --> 22:10.240
You know, we keep hearing like people saying, oh, Elementary OS is in beta.

22:10.240 --> 22:13.520
And so it was really confusing for people to have that leading zero in there.

22:13.520 --> 22:18.100
So we thought, okay, well, you know, we got to version bump that, right?

22:18.100 --> 22:23.000
We got to move that up into at least 1.0 territory so people stop thinking this is a beta product.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.280
Honestly, I feel like you got there with Freya, really.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.140
Yeah, you know.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.140
Which was 0.3.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.140
Right.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.480
And it's been quite an evolution, to be honest.

22:33.480 --> 22:39.120
And we're, we are kind of holding off on the 1.0 because we wanted to make sure that we

22:39.120 --> 22:46.000
had, I don't know if control is the right word, but at least influence in everything

22:46.000 --> 22:50.760
that the user sees and touches, that we're able to fix the issues that our users report

22:50.760 --> 22:52.320
to us.

22:52.320 --> 22:58.080
And so we're kind of, we're way more there than we were before.

22:58.080 --> 23:05.440
And this Juno release has the most elementary stuff in it out of any release before, as

23:05.440 --> 23:09.780
far as our desktop environment and all the apps we ship.

23:09.780 --> 23:14.240
And now we have an application ecosystem that people are developing apps for Elementary

23:14.240 --> 23:15.240
OS.

23:15.240 --> 23:18.200
So it's like a huge shift from where we were when we started out.

23:18.200 --> 23:22.320
It's the stuff that actually makes the platform, to be frank about it.

23:22.320 --> 23:29.480
And I like this post, I don't know if you guys intended it for this, but if I had never

23:29.480 --> 23:34.640
heard of Elementary OS and all of a sudden I saw, why do these cocky sons of bitches

23:34.640 --> 23:35.680
want money from me?

23:35.680 --> 23:40.080
If I read this post, I would be compelled to donate lots of money.

23:40.080 --> 23:45.080
Because within the screen, if you just look at the damn screenshots, it is so clear.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.680
Like here, Wes, I'm going to do, are you ready for this, Wes?

23:46.680 --> 23:50.600
I'm going to do a little, so here is, we start here at the beginning.

23:50.600 --> 23:55.320
There's an Elementary OS Jupiter 0.1 and it looks like a GTK Gnome 2 respawn.

23:55.320 --> 23:56.680
No problems here, but yeah.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.600
Then you get to version 0.2 and you're like, oh, okay, it's GTK 3.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.480
It's got a nice theme going for it.

24:02.480 --> 24:09.280
But by the time you get to Freya 0.3, you have a whole lot of Elementary OS features,

24:09.280 --> 24:15.400
including a whole bunch of nice styling, animations, a real clear visual communication.

24:15.400 --> 24:16.400
Definitely.

24:16.400 --> 24:21.320
You have their own application launcher, their own settings panels, a do not disturb system

24:21.320 --> 24:22.320
with notifications.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.200
Like it's clearly its own product by 0.3.

24:25.200 --> 24:31.400
Then when you look at Loki 0.4, one of the things that strikes me about Loki is it's

24:31.400 --> 24:38.480
all of the stuff I just said, plus kind of building on top of that a more refined look,

24:38.480 --> 24:42.480
clear path for third party developers, style sheets, APIs.

24:42.480 --> 24:48.040
It honestly starts to become a platform by Loki version 0.4, the current version.

24:48.040 --> 24:52.280
But the other thing that you guys have done with Loki that struck me, and maybe this was

24:52.280 --> 24:59.040
the case with Freya and I just didn't notice it, but it feels like Loki just keeps constantly

24:59.040 --> 25:00.440
getting better.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.400
There's new stuff that just keeps coming to Loki.

25:02.400 --> 25:07.480
There hasn't been this big gap while I'm just waiting for the next version of Elementary,

25:07.480 --> 25:09.920
the next big drop.

25:09.920 --> 25:14.000
Because in this meantime, I am kind of waiting for that, but in the meantime, stuff has just

25:14.000 --> 25:18.520
kept coming down to Loki, like updates, like the App Center, for example, the updates,

25:18.520 --> 25:19.520
all of that stuff.

25:19.520 --> 25:24.580
It just is new in Loki, which has been the current release now for a while.

25:24.580 --> 25:28.680
And so you guys have legitimately built a platform.

25:28.680 --> 25:31.880
And I think when people say that, some people get triggered because it sounds like cloud,

25:31.880 --> 25:33.840
it sounds like vlog, it sounds like blog.

25:33.840 --> 25:38.360
It's one of these, it's a term, it's this nebulous term, but it's an App Center, it's

25:38.360 --> 25:42.000
a design language, it's a clear path for developers.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.920
It's a lack of nebulousness, right?

25:43.920 --> 25:44.920
Yeah, exactly.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.560
It is something concrete now.

25:46.560 --> 25:47.560
Yeah.

25:47.560 --> 25:52.840
So, but I mean, not to belabor this point, but just because this is the thing that everybody's

25:52.840 --> 25:56.160
been talking about, why not just say 1.0?

25:56.160 --> 25:57.640
Right.

25:57.640 --> 26:03.480
And the reason why not to go 1.0 is less marketing and more organizational.

26:03.480 --> 26:06.280
So that's kind of the other component of it.

26:06.280 --> 26:12.740
And what we're looking at is we want to try to bring everything into alignment with semantic

26:12.740 --> 26:19.000
versioning so that we have that major, minor, that whole thing going on.

26:19.000 --> 26:24.220
But what we have right now is a lot of version numbers throughout all of our different products

26:24.220 --> 26:27.900
that are misaligned and some of them are more than 1.0.

26:27.900 --> 26:32.780
And so by just kind of removing that leading zero, then we can eventually get to a place

26:32.780 --> 26:40.600
where across the board, like all the APIs for our 5x series are 5x and all the applications

26:40.600 --> 26:44.240
are 5x, you know, get everything all kind of aligned.

26:44.240 --> 26:45.240
Very nice.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.520
So it's a Windows 10 effort then?

26:47.520 --> 26:49.760
Oh, I have no idea.

26:49.760 --> 26:50.760
Sure.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.040
No, but I get what you're saying.

26:52.040 --> 26:57.740
You're saying developers can say, okay, so you have the 5.x version of this API support

26:57.740 --> 27:00.200
or this application, so I know what I can target there.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.320
And then eventually down the road, it'll be 6x and 7x, yeah?

27:03.320 --> 27:04.320
Yeah, exactly.

27:04.320 --> 27:07.880
So the version number for all of our products aligns with that release.

27:07.880 --> 27:08.880
Damn.

27:08.880 --> 27:09.880
Very nice.

27:09.880 --> 27:10.880
Forward thinking.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.560
Yeah, you're taking what I always compliment you guys.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.680
Here's the clear developer story.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.520
Here's how you target the platform.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.840
Here's the design language you use.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.960
In fact, here's a widget you can use to make it look like everything else.

27:22.960 --> 27:26.920
And now you're going to the next level and saying, here's the APIs that you can guarantee

27:26.920 --> 27:27.920
work.

27:27.920 --> 27:28.920
Yeah.

27:28.920 --> 27:35.760
So we're really trying to get to a point where that level of clarity permeates throughout

27:35.760 --> 27:40.920
the entirety of the stack and not just with, oh, it's clear for users to use applications,

27:40.920 --> 27:43.080
but it's clear for developers to write them as well.

27:43.080 --> 27:50.980
Right, because 5.0 is going to mean GTK 3.22.

27:50.980 --> 27:53.520
It's going to mean high DPI.

27:53.520 --> 27:55.640
It's going to mean kernel Linux version something x.

27:55.640 --> 27:56.640
Yeah.

27:56.640 --> 28:04.440
So elementary 5.0 actually means GTK x, kernel version x, system DX, Xorg or Wayland x, doesn't

28:04.440 --> 28:05.440
it?

28:05.440 --> 28:06.440
Yeah, right.

28:06.440 --> 28:12.480
Because the new 5.0 release is going to be based, or we're currently building it, on

28:12.480 --> 28:14.480
the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

28:14.480 --> 28:19.520
So it does bring a hardware enablement stack and a ton of new APIs from all our upstreams

28:19.520 --> 28:20.520
as well.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.520
Yeah.

28:21.520 --> 28:26.160
I mean, that's the practical version of it is it's 5.0 is going to be 18.04 LTS.

28:26.160 --> 28:31.000
But developers won't even need to understand that esoteric differentiator.

28:31.000 --> 28:37.120
It'll just be 5.0 of the elementary OS platform has these capabilities.

28:37.120 --> 28:41.360
6.0 has these capabilities.

28:41.360 --> 28:45.160
But what's with the need of the dot dot o anyway?

28:45.160 --> 28:50.200
Is there any need for like a 0.5 release just for beta possibly or anything like that?

28:50.200 --> 28:58.640
Yeah, so what it is is basically the same like we did with Loki where we had a 0.4 release

28:58.640 --> 29:01.280
and then we had 0.4.1.

29:01.280 --> 29:05.520
And what that was is it's a bump to a new hardware enablement stack or adding new major

29:05.520 --> 29:07.320
features or things like that.

29:07.320 --> 29:14.280
So we do have those minor revisions that we'll push out if we make a new ISO release.

29:14.280 --> 29:19.320
So it's something significant enough to trigger a new build, but not significant enough to

29:19.320 --> 29:22.400
break API.

29:22.400 --> 29:29.080
Also real quick, why did you name it after a very infamous film about a pregnant teenager?

29:29.080 --> 29:30.080
Juno?

29:30.080 --> 29:35.760
It could be or a city in Alaska, I mean, let's be honest.

29:35.760 --> 29:42.680
So for our code names, we use the names of deities and it turns out that the majority

29:42.680 --> 29:46.560
of the really nice sounding deity names are like Greek and Roman usually.

29:46.560 --> 29:49.920
And so we did a couple of Norse ones.

29:49.920 --> 29:57.560
The problem is I took a bunch of the solar system names with Jupiter broadcasting, right?

29:57.560 --> 30:02.200
Well actually, not only does that make sense, Dan, but it goes deeper than I first understood.

30:02.200 --> 30:06.000
So I really appreciate you coming on and explaining it to me.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.960
Wow, that's great.

30:07.960 --> 30:12.280
I mean, that is so great because it clearly contributes to the developer story.

30:12.280 --> 30:22.600
Just as a super quick follow up, if you could, how much has the one week reaction reeked

30:22.600 --> 30:27.880
for the announcement about charging for upgrades or attempting to charge for upgrades?

30:27.880 --> 30:30.800
Like now that you've had a week to marinate with it, how's that gone?

30:30.800 --> 30:31.800
I think it's been really good.

30:31.800 --> 30:35.200
We've got a lot of really positive feedback and interesting comments from people.

30:35.200 --> 30:37.320
Is interesting a way of saying controversial?

30:37.320 --> 30:38.320
Like really?

30:38.320 --> 30:42.840
Is it like, are you guys like pulling back at all or does it feel like full steam ahead?

30:42.840 --> 30:48.480
No, I mean, interesting in terms of bringing up things that we were looking for people

30:48.480 --> 30:52.440
to bring up like, hey, what happens in this case kind of thing?

30:52.440 --> 30:58.080
And by discussing it with other people and bringing it up where we've had more plans

30:58.080 --> 31:04.520
to push into, okay, well now how does multi-machine work or how does a fresh install work as opposed

31:04.520 --> 31:09.200
to an upgrade or things like that or like how that was one of the major concerns that

31:09.200 --> 31:14.820
people brought up that we're currently working through is what happens if I want to transfer

31:14.820 --> 31:18.160
my purchases to another computer?

31:18.160 --> 31:20.880
That seems like a huge problem to solve.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.880
I mean, that's the number one issue that I raised and I have even gone on the record

31:24.880 --> 31:28.960
and said I'd be willing to pay a bit more if I knew that it would persist across all

31:28.960 --> 31:29.960
machines.

31:29.960 --> 31:32.440
But that just, that seems like...

31:32.440 --> 31:34.920
It doesn't kind of be expected to be persistent.

31:34.920 --> 31:35.920
It almost is, right?

31:35.920 --> 31:36.920
In this day and age.

31:36.920 --> 31:37.920
Because of other app stores.

31:37.920 --> 31:38.920
Yeah.

31:38.920 --> 31:39.920
I think that's a great point.

31:39.920 --> 31:44.440
But the technical limitation means you have to somehow track me across all my machines.

31:44.440 --> 31:45.440
Yeah.

31:45.440 --> 31:51.200
So that's the major balance point, right, is how do we set things up in a way that is

31:51.200 --> 31:56.320
convenient and adds these features that people want, but also in a way that is secure and

31:56.320 --> 31:58.120
respects your privacy?

31:58.120 --> 31:59.120
Yeah.

31:59.120 --> 32:03.720
I do not envy that task, my friend.

32:03.720 --> 32:04.720
Not in the least.

32:04.720 --> 32:08.880
No, Wes and I cover that kind of stuff all the time on TechSnap and it is a massive technical

32:08.880 --> 32:09.880
challenge.

32:09.880 --> 32:13.560
And if you ever want to talk about it, you know where to come because we'd love to hear

32:13.560 --> 32:14.560
more about it.

32:14.560 --> 32:16.400
But I'm sure that's all down the road stuff.

32:16.400 --> 32:21.640
In the meantime, anything else to note about the Junos release or about the announcement

32:21.640 --> 32:23.600
about the bump?

32:23.600 --> 32:24.600
Anything like that?

32:24.600 --> 32:30.720
Well, you know, that wallpaper that I just made for the 5.0 beta is pretty fire and you

32:30.720 --> 32:34.240
can go check it out on our blog and you should download that.

32:34.240 --> 32:37.200
Even if you're not running the beta, which you aren't because it doesn't exist in the

32:37.200 --> 32:41.520
public, you should just stick that wallpaper out there because it's pretty sick.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.520
That does look nice.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.640
I think I will.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.600
Good call on that.

32:45.600 --> 32:49.840
I've been following with more and more interest, Dan, so I appreciate you stopping by.

32:49.840 --> 32:50.840
All right.

32:50.840 --> 32:53.640
Well, we'll have a link to all of that shenanigans in the show notes.

32:53.640 --> 32:54.640
Go check that out.

32:54.640 --> 33:00.520
I think it's going to be a big release, you know, for a couple of years, two maybe.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.520
No, no.

33:01.520 --> 33:02.760
I don't know if it's two years.

33:02.760 --> 33:03.760
I don't know.

33:03.760 --> 33:07.120
I guess we stopped doing last in 2017.

33:07.120 --> 33:12.240
And I think we, I don't know if you look at last, I think we kind of pulled back on reviews

33:12.240 --> 33:13.320
a year before that.

33:13.320 --> 33:14.320
That's a good point.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.800
Yeah, you kind of did.

33:15.800 --> 33:17.840
And right now I've got the itch.

33:17.840 --> 33:20.120
I mean, so not only do we have a new version of...

33:20.120 --> 33:21.120
Spring is coming up.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.120
I know, right?

33:22.120 --> 33:23.120
There's distros to try.

33:23.120 --> 33:24.120
Oh, I thought you were going to say it's allergies.

33:24.120 --> 33:25.120
Oh, well, that too.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.120
It's a nasty itch.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.120
I'm so sorry for you.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.920
Yeah, I call it Mint 19 right here.

33:28.920 --> 33:29.920
It's got a rash.

33:29.920 --> 33:37.360
No, I just, I have a good feeling about some of the distro releases that are coming because

33:37.360 --> 33:42.080
a lot of them are based on Ubuntu, which is going to be a major update soon.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.400
But a lot of them are also trying to differentiate.

33:44.400 --> 33:50.440
I've recently started following the Solus project again with a lot of close intensity.

33:50.440 --> 33:55.320
I don't know if Aiki is just trying to lure me with his Sweet Siren song, but they're

33:55.320 --> 33:59.240
talking more and more about their Plasma version.

33:59.240 --> 34:00.680
And there's just a lot of good releases.

34:00.680 --> 34:05.380
We just recently talked with the Fedora group about Fedora Atomic and all of that.

34:05.380 --> 34:08.620
So there's just so much good stuff coming down the pipe.

34:08.620 --> 34:11.520
And it just means that you and I have a bunch of good stuff to talk about.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.680
And a ton of great things to try.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.520
Anyways, let's keep going.

34:15.520 --> 34:20.480
I got a chance to go down to Microsoft last Friday and...

34:20.480 --> 34:21.480
Have they turned you?

34:21.480 --> 34:22.480
I mean, should I be suspicious?

34:22.480 --> 34:23.880
Am I safe right here in the studio next to you?

34:23.880 --> 34:26.240
Do you like my Windows 10 system here?

34:26.240 --> 34:28.760
It's nice, isn't it?

34:28.760 --> 34:33.880
No, actually, in all fairness to them, they did not try to convert me to Windows 10 at

34:33.880 --> 34:34.880
all.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.440
So I got to give them credit for that.

34:37.440 --> 34:41.500
We will talk about that in just a moment.

34:41.500 --> 34:44.800
But first, I want to talk about DigitalOcean.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.400
It's infrastructure on demand.

34:46.400 --> 34:51.040
Super fast, really reliable infrastructure with eight data centers all over the world.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.880
In fact, by the time you're listening to this, it could be more.

34:53.880 --> 34:58.760
That's why companies like Docker and Slack and GitLab and Tesla use DigitalOcean and

34:58.760 --> 35:01.160
Jupyter Broadcasting as well.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.240
DigitalOcean.com.

35:02.240 --> 35:06.040
Go over there, create your account, and then use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.880
It's one word, and you'll get a $10 credit.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.720
You can spin up infrastructure on demand.

35:10.720 --> 35:14.020
It's one of the things that Wes and I do all the time for TechSnap is when we're trying

35:14.020 --> 35:18.960
something out, I'm like, how do we talk about this in a way that makes sense?

35:18.960 --> 35:19.960
Wes knows exactly.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.200
There's something we did recently.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.400
I don't want to say it.

35:22.400 --> 35:23.400
You know what I'm talking about.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.400
I do know what you're talking about.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.400
You know what I'm talking about.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.880
And it's like, well, we want to talk about this in a way where we have actual knowledge,

35:28.880 --> 35:30.120
like hands-on experience with it.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.800
So you just spin it up on a DigitalOcean droplet.

35:31.800 --> 35:32.800
You try it out.

35:32.800 --> 35:33.800
Done.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.120
I mean, we had that whole thing done within 10 minutes.

35:36.120 --> 35:39.600
And then we just played around for the next 20 minutes just to see what we could do.

35:39.600 --> 35:45.520
It's so great because you go from, I have this idea, to full production in minutes.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.600
You can get started in less than 55 seconds.

35:47.600 --> 35:50.720
And they have 99.99% uptime.

35:50.720 --> 35:54.420
If you want to deploy just the base system or an entire infrastructure, you can do it

35:54.420 --> 35:56.120
over at digitalocean.com.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.280
And they've just revamped their pricing.

35:58.280 --> 35:59.900
So it's just even more competitive.

35:59.900 --> 36:01.440
It's just ridiculous now.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.280
And they have mix and match droplets.

36:03.280 --> 36:06.360
So in the past, it was like, you buy this droplet for this price.

36:06.360 --> 36:10.120
And now you can just mix and match disk and CPU and RAM.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.480
It's going crazy.

36:11.480 --> 36:16.520
And then you combine that with block storage, which just shows up as a Dev SDA device on

36:16.520 --> 36:17.560
your Linux rig.

36:17.560 --> 36:22.840
Or you can go next level and go with object storage, which is 100% compatible with all

36:22.840 --> 36:26.200
of the S3 CMD type API command stuff.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.260
But it's on DigitalOcean infrastructure.

36:29.260 --> 36:33.880
So really great backup programs on Linux.

36:33.880 --> 36:37.640
And all of that stuff just works with DigitalOcean spaces.

36:37.640 --> 36:40.000
It is so worth your time.

36:40.000 --> 36:43.640
And if you can go over there and use our promo code with a $10 credit, that'll help.

36:43.640 --> 36:47.980
You can play around with your own custom spun backup system that just specifically hones

36:47.980 --> 36:48.980
in on your needs.

36:48.980 --> 36:50.080

37:27.120 --> 37:28.120
the unplugged program.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.400
That was, I tell you what.

37:30.400 --> 37:34.680
Going down to Microsoft stressed me out.

37:34.680 --> 37:41.080
Because I, this is why one of the main reasons I got out of IT contracting is I have this

37:41.080 --> 37:50.960
really super weird anxiety about going to a certain place at a certain time when I have

37:50.960 --> 37:55.800
to navigate like a comp, I'm actually having a slight panic attack just telling you about

37:55.800 --> 37:56.800
this.

37:56.800 --> 37:57.800
I'm really.

37:57.800 --> 37:58.800
Take it slow.

37:58.800 --> 38:06.080
I have this anxiety where if I need to be someplace that's like way south of Arlington

38:06.080 --> 38:11.240
at a certain time and I have to like park somewhere and then navigate like a series

38:11.240 --> 38:12.240
of buildings.

38:12.240 --> 38:13.840
Especially somewhere you haven't been to.

38:13.840 --> 38:17.600
Specifically it comes up when I go to Amazon or Microsoft or T-Mobile.

38:17.600 --> 38:22.160
Like whenever I go to a, we're like a multi-building campus and I have to be in a certain conference

38:22.160 --> 38:26.360
room at a certain time and just like I've never been to that campus.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.360
So navigating it.

38:27.360 --> 38:28.360
Do you know what I'm talking about?

38:28.360 --> 38:31.200
I'm legitimately having a panic attack just telling you about this.

38:31.200 --> 38:35.560
And so that is how I spent my entire Friday last week was that I spent the first half

38:35.560 --> 38:37.200
of the day having a panic attack.

38:37.200 --> 38:39.900
And then I spent the second half of the day going to Microsoft.

38:39.900 --> 38:45.680
And then once I'm on site I am as cool as a cucumber.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.200
Legitimately no anxiety.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.200
I am 100% comfortable.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.840
We just have to get you there.

38:49.840 --> 38:54.040
Yeah I just have to get there and like get to where I need to be.

38:54.040 --> 38:59.040
And once I'm where I need to be and I have plenty of time I'm completely comfortable.

38:59.040 --> 39:05.280
So I showed up an hour early.

39:05.280 --> 39:06.840
With traffic and anything else?

39:06.840 --> 39:08.200
How else can you plan for that?

39:08.200 --> 39:13.600
And I had my lady Hadia come with me for emotional support because she's really good at navigating

39:13.600 --> 39:16.600
when I'm totally just like totally anxious out.

39:16.600 --> 39:20.800
She'll do the driving, the navigating, the parking in the parking garage and like all

39:20.800 --> 39:26.040
of that that totally takes care of my anxiety and lets me just focus on the task at hand.

39:26.040 --> 39:31.600
And so she came with me to essentially be my emotional support partner.

39:31.600 --> 39:35.040
I know that sounds ridiculous but I don't know what it is about these companies.

39:35.040 --> 39:39.380
But they give me this sense of anxiety because like when I go to meet other business owners

39:39.380 --> 39:45.640
or community members like we go to a bar or I go to their house or something like that.

39:45.640 --> 39:48.920
But they're standing behind the counter and you're like oh hi yeah you own the business.

39:48.920 --> 39:54.320
It's a totally different thing and so when you go to to Microsoft's Bellevue campus which

39:54.320 --> 40:00.440
I had never been I've only I've only been to the Redmond campus at Microsoft.

40:00.440 --> 40:03.740
It's like a totally different experience.

40:03.740 --> 40:09.440
So you park in the parking garage and you work your way up the elevator and you go across

40:09.440 --> 40:11.960
what they call the breezeway.

40:11.960 --> 40:15.920
And I have a picture of it on the video version if you're watching right now of the breezeway.

40:15.920 --> 40:24.560
And it feels like you're walking through an old Roman palace with marble everywhere fountains

40:24.560 --> 40:29.520
Gucci stores with gold walls and LED lights.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.440
So that's why you look so nice today.

40:31.440 --> 40:37.880
Yeah it's it is it is full of stores that I think get one or two customers a day.

40:37.880 --> 40:44.660
I mean this is a very ritzy place in Washington and Microsoft has a temporary they have two

40:44.660 --> 40:48.640
buildings and the building I was going to is a temporary building.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.880
They call it the Braven building.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.920
And when I finally when I finally got there and I got past the Gucci stores and the in

40:54.920 --> 40:59.240
the Prava stores and the water fountains and the statues and I got through the elevator

40:59.240 --> 41:09.280
and got to the third floor I arrived at the reception desk.

41:09.280 --> 41:13.120
And of course I had to get the parking validated because that's what you do in Bellevue.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.120
Right absolutely.

41:14.120 --> 41:17.880
You know what was a little disorienting is the first thing that you see isn't the reception

41:17.880 --> 41:19.160
desk.

41:19.160 --> 41:24.080
It's actually it's funny it's it's one of those things that's really it just drove home

41:24.080 --> 41:25.080
to me.

41:25.080 --> 41:27.940
I'm obviously in a business filled with geeks.

41:27.940 --> 41:33.060
When you walk in through the main door the first desk you see isn't reception.

41:33.060 --> 41:36.560
The first desk you see is tech support seems sort of appropriate.

41:36.560 --> 41:42.340
So you get there and you open up the glass doors and you see this huge desk and you walk

41:42.340 --> 41:45.160
up to it and you're like I'm here to see.

41:45.160 --> 41:50.080
And before you get those words completely out of your mouth you see I.T. you see support

41:50.080 --> 41:52.280
and you see guys that look just like you.

41:52.280 --> 41:54.960
And you go this is tech support isn't it.

41:54.960 --> 41:58.120
They're like they're like yeah receptions over there.

41:58.120 --> 42:00.600
We get this all the time.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.800
So obviously for geeks.

42:02.800 --> 42:05.680
And so we get there we check in I get the parking validated.

42:05.680 --> 42:09.240
I'm sitting around in like these future space chairs look like they're off the set of Star

42:09.240 --> 42:10.920
Trek Discovery.

42:10.920 --> 42:12.920
Are you wearing any Linux swag.

42:12.920 --> 42:13.920
I did dude.

42:13.920 --> 42:15.600
I wore the thank you for asking.

42:15.600 --> 42:23.440
I wore the last finale head hoodie with the with the final last logo with the year.

42:23.440 --> 42:26.880
It's the shirt I'm actually wearing now only with our full run year on it.

42:26.880 --> 42:32.520
And I so I wore the hoodie but underneath it I wore my nicest blue business dress shirt

42:32.520 --> 42:33.960
button down business shirt.

42:33.960 --> 42:34.960
You're a professional.

42:34.960 --> 42:38.000
And I wear nice slacks.

42:38.000 --> 42:43.440
So I was going for the corporate lifestyle reject look so that way they could acknowledge

42:43.440 --> 42:48.080
and accept me but and wouldn't feel off put but yet would understand I'm not one of them.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.080
Right.

42:49.080 --> 42:50.080
You speak their language but you're not.

42:50.080 --> 42:52.240
Yeah that's exactly.

42:52.240 --> 42:56.560
And so we're sitting around in the Star Trek Discovery future chairs and they all and you're

42:56.560 --> 43:01.560
looking over this marble promenade that has fountains and glass fixtures and the Gucci

43:01.560 --> 43:06.160
stores and then behind us are these future lights look like they might be the transporter

43:06.160 --> 43:09.120
room on the USS Discovery.

43:09.120 --> 43:13.780
And as I'm sitting there just sort of taking all of this in a Jeffrey's assistant walks

43:13.780 --> 43:14.780
up to us.

43:14.780 --> 43:17.440
I mean after all Jeffrey is a fellow at Microsoft.

43:17.440 --> 43:18.440
Yeah.

43:18.440 --> 43:19.440
Hi Susan.

43:19.440 --> 43:26.480
Oh no problem.

43:26.480 --> 43:30.060
So I hand off the microphone to Hadia and we go through several different layers of

43:30.060 --> 43:35.800
glass doors that she seems to authenticate with her badge and then the glass doors open

43:35.800 --> 43:39.560
and then she says something to us that sort of stuck out.

43:39.560 --> 43:43.920
And I had to I had to like think about it for a moment before we sat down and before

43:43.920 --> 43:50.320
we did all of our conversation she says to me and to Hadia would you like to buy something

43:50.320 --> 43:57.200
to drink before we go into the conference room not would you like something to drink

43:57.200 --> 43:59.540
would you like to buy something to drink.

43:59.540 --> 44:05.060
Now my experience at the Redmond campus was on every floor they just have like a store

44:05.060 --> 44:08.680
area where you can just go in and get anything you want for free.

44:08.680 --> 44:12.840
But this is a temporary building that they're only in for a couple of years so they don't

44:12.840 --> 44:18.200
have the traditional Microsoft infrastructure and it gives it like this small company feeling

44:18.200 --> 44:21.680
because they're not like regular Microsoft.

44:21.680 --> 44:25.080
Yeah we've got the soda machine out back if you need something.

44:25.080 --> 44:29.480
So I turn around the corner and we meet Hadia and I we meet Jeffrey and Joey.

44:29.480 --> 44:30.480
Thank you.

44:30.480 --> 44:31.480
Hi I'm Chris.

44:31.480 --> 44:32.480
Hi Jeffrey.

44:32.480 --> 44:33.480
Nice to meet you.

44:33.480 --> 44:34.480
Joey.

44:34.480 --> 44:35.480
Nice to meet you.

44:35.480 --> 44:36.480
Nice to meet you.

44:36.480 --> 44:37.480
Nice to meet you.

44:37.480 --> 44:38.480
Nice to meet you.

44:38.480 --> 44:39.480
Nice to meet you.

44:39.480 --> 44:40.480
Nice to meet you.

44:40.480 --> 44:41.480
Nice to meet you.

44:41.480 --> 44:42.480
Nice to meet you Hadia.

44:42.480 --> 44:43.480
Hadia.

44:43.480 --> 44:44.480
Hadia.

44:44.480 --> 44:45.480
Nice to meet you.

44:45.480 --> 44:46.480
Hadia.

44:46.480 --> 44:47.480
Like quesadilla nice to meet you.

44:47.480 --> 44:48.480
Yeah excellent.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.480
Where should we sit.

44:49.480 --> 44:50.480
You own the room.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.480
Oh well OK then.

44:51.480 --> 44:52.480
And Jeffrey might have been the most perfect person for us to talk to.

44:52.480 --> 44:53.480
Yeah I'm Jeffrey Snover.

44:53.480 --> 44:54.480
I'm a technical fellow at Microsoft.

44:54.480 --> 44:56.040
He's been there for 18 years and Joey also joined us.

44:56.040 --> 44:57.980
He's the PM for PowerShell.

44:57.980 --> 45:00.920
And what's great about both these guys is they're Linux guys.

45:00.920 --> 45:05.160
I'm Joey Aiello, and I'm the program manager for PowerShell Core.

45:05.160 --> 45:08.340
But while I was setting up for the interview, and so I apologize for the audio and some

45:08.340 --> 45:11.760
of the noise in the background, but we just had the recorder going.

45:11.760 --> 45:17.280
While we're setting up to start talking to them, Jeffrey tells me that 18 years ago,

45:17.280 --> 45:19.200
he never thought he'd work for Microsoft.

45:19.200 --> 45:24.080
You know, I was reading your, or listening to your podcast about, oh, they're doing this

45:24.080 --> 45:25.080
and this.

45:25.080 --> 45:26.080
And it's like, no, that's not it.

45:26.080 --> 45:27.080
No, that's not it.

45:27.080 --> 45:28.080
Okay, good.

45:28.080 --> 45:29.080
Well, that's a good place to start.

45:29.080 --> 45:30.080
Exactly.

45:30.080 --> 45:31.080
Way too much credit.

45:31.080 --> 45:32.080
Oh, really?

45:32.080 --> 45:33.080
Oh, I see.

45:33.080 --> 45:34.080
See, I had some sort of master plan.

45:34.080 --> 45:35.080
Yeah.

45:35.080 --> 45:36.080
Well, I do tend to.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.080
Yeah, that was the thing.

45:37.080 --> 45:45.280
When I started the company, like, the last thing I wanted to do was to come work for

45:45.280 --> 45:46.280
Microsoft.

45:46.280 --> 45:50.840
You know, I thought them the evil corporate, evil empire, I knew all this.

45:50.840 --> 45:57.400
And then when I came and visited, you know, I actually, my joke was I never joined Microsoft,

45:57.400 --> 45:58.400
I joined this one executive.

45:58.400 --> 46:00.880
He was just an awesome exec.

46:00.880 --> 46:05.480
And then I got in here and it's like, oh, yeah, no, it's not malice.

46:05.480 --> 46:06.480
It's not evil.

46:06.480 --> 46:09.480
It's just people whose hair is on fire.

46:09.480 --> 46:14.400
People whose hair is on fire, which totally echoes some of my other industry experience.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.400
And so I'm like, oh, that's, that's super interesting.

46:16.400 --> 46:19.960
Joey, the PowerShell project manager says, Oh, yeah, me too.

46:19.960 --> 46:20.960
I was a Gentoo guy.

46:20.960 --> 46:22.680
I never thought I'd work at Microsoft.

46:22.680 --> 46:23.680
It was the same for me.

46:23.680 --> 46:24.680
Yeah.

46:24.680 --> 46:25.680
Really?

46:25.680 --> 46:30.400
Yeah, I mean, come in from college, and I've been here almost four years and it's, it's,

46:30.400 --> 46:32.640
you weren't thinking you'd be at Microsoft either?

46:32.640 --> 46:33.640
No.

46:33.640 --> 46:34.640
But you do.

46:34.640 --> 46:37.680
Yeah, you come in and meet a bunch of smart people and everybody's solving problems and

46:37.680 --> 46:38.680
it's like, oh, okay.

46:38.680 --> 46:39.680
Yeah.

46:39.680 --> 46:43.520
It's just, you realize very quickly, you know, everything was always official, right?

46:43.520 --> 46:46.720
It's like you see something come out, like an update or something and it's like, oh,

46:46.720 --> 46:47.720
it's Microsoft, right?

46:47.720 --> 46:52.000
That like put this thing out and you're like, like, oh, it's just like, there's three guys

46:52.000 --> 46:55.320
over there that just like did that, you know, yeah.

46:55.320 --> 46:56.320
Especially when it's a big company.

46:56.320 --> 47:01.320
You tend to think it's like, oh, it's a team of a thousand, a team of two thousand.

47:01.320 --> 47:02.320
Right.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.320
Right.

47:03.320 --> 47:04.320
Exactly.

47:04.320 --> 47:05.320
No, it's like general.

47:05.320 --> 47:06.320
Wow.

47:06.320 --> 47:07.320
Yeah.

47:07.320 --> 47:09.960
It was really kind of interesting because they, they, they felt, I felt from them, like

47:09.960 --> 47:11.820
they wanted to advocate their position.

47:11.820 --> 47:15.240
And I got a sense that's kind of why I was there.

47:15.240 --> 47:18.840
And the PowerShell team specifically, you know, now Microsoft has open sourced a lot

47:18.840 --> 47:24.560
of things, including.NET Core, Visual Studio Code, and then PowerShell came along.

47:24.560 --> 47:30.000
And I think they knew that there would be a lot of skepticism in the Linux community.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.600
And they also knew that they had a long road ahead of them.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.720
But I got the sense that they were completely committed to it.

47:35.720 --> 47:36.720
And that's why I was there.

47:36.720 --> 47:41.040
You know, we just knew we were not going to be greeted as like liberators to the Linux

47:41.040 --> 47:42.040
community.

47:42.040 --> 47:43.040
Right?

47:43.040 --> 47:44.040
So it's like, okay, how do we deal with that?

47:44.040 --> 47:45.040
How do we get the tone right?

47:45.040 --> 47:46.040
Yeah.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.040
How do we get the culture right?

47:47.040 --> 47:49.200
Both in the product and how we engage them.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.200
We're still trying to figure that out.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.200
Yeah.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.200
That's what the conversation was in CoderRadius.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.440
So what is going on?

47:53.440 --> 47:54.780
So I kept having the conversation.

47:54.780 --> 47:56.080
I got them on mic.

47:56.080 --> 47:58.520
This is all just on the preset up while we're getting ready to go.

47:58.520 --> 48:03.960
I got them on mic and I started to get a sense of why Microsoft is trying so hard.

48:03.960 --> 48:09.680
You know, you can judge how successful they are with engaging open source community with

48:09.680 --> 48:12.840
being a quote unquote good Linux community citizen.

48:12.840 --> 48:17.440
But I got a real sense that there is something that's driving them.

48:17.440 --> 48:21.900
It's not just marketing.

48:21.900 --> 48:27.740
I got a sense that perhaps the situation is becoming such that one of their biggest money

48:27.740 --> 48:33.980
makers, Azure, is simply becoming a predominant Linux platform.

48:33.980 --> 48:35.640
And that's just the reality that they're in.

48:35.640 --> 48:40.920
And no matter how Microsoft spins the numbers, there's more and more Linux systems than Windows

48:40.920 --> 48:41.920
systems on Azure.

48:41.920 --> 48:46.280
Yeah, no, I don't know if you've seen, but on Azure, you know, look, here's the reality.

48:46.280 --> 48:51.300
I mean, you just look at the world and do the math, right?

48:51.300 --> 48:58.100
If we say Azure is the Windows cloud, okay, well then you're taking off a very large portion

48:58.100 --> 48:59.100
of the world.

48:59.100 --> 49:01.240
You're just saying, I'm not going to go get that market.

49:01.240 --> 49:02.720
That doesn't make any sense.

49:02.720 --> 49:08.520
And then you can't be a trusted supplier to those companies that said, I want a heterogeneous

49:08.520 --> 49:09.520
world.

49:09.520 --> 49:13.460
So we have been investing for years in great Linux support.

49:13.460 --> 49:19.560
And now that number of Linux VMs is almost equal to the number of Windows VMs.

49:19.560 --> 49:20.560
That's impressive.

49:20.560 --> 49:26.760
Because I think the last number I heard from Azure was 30% or something like that, which

49:26.760 --> 49:27.760
is getting higher and higher.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.320
Yeah, it's going higher fast.

49:29.320 --> 49:34.120
And he does one of these like way higher, like gestures, like it's maybe more closer

49:34.120 --> 49:35.920
to 50-50.

49:35.920 --> 49:38.020
And Microsoft can't spin that any other way.

49:38.020 --> 49:41.600
They have to acknowledge that reality.

49:41.600 --> 49:44.720
So he said something in there that sounded like spin, but I got a better understanding

49:44.720 --> 49:45.720
of it.

49:45.720 --> 49:47.040
He said, you know, we've invested for years in Linux.

49:47.040 --> 49:48.840
Well, what the does that mean, right?

49:48.840 --> 49:50.760
Yeah, that's a very vague statement.

49:50.760 --> 49:53.480
I went deeper on that in Coderadio this week.

49:53.480 --> 49:55.480
And I kind of encourage you guys to go check that out.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.600
I know that's a super punt.

49:57.600 --> 49:59.200
And I apologize.

49:59.200 --> 50:05.200
But we just talk about the tools that people use for developing software deeper in Coderadio.

50:05.200 --> 50:09.640
So in episode 296, Chris goes to Microsoft.

50:09.640 --> 50:16.640
Specifically Joey, who we haven't heard from yet, talks more about retooling their Windows

50:16.640 --> 50:21.200
only team around Linux and all of that stuff, which was really interesting.

50:21.200 --> 50:24.780
So we do deep dive into how they made that transition.

50:24.780 --> 50:29.640
But I wanted to talk with you guys about the really super awkward spot that I was sensing

50:29.640 --> 50:31.360
that Microsoft is in.

50:31.360 --> 50:39.520
And I really appreciated what they couldn't say in this clip.

50:39.520 --> 50:43.040
I want you to listen with certain kinds of ears on.

50:43.040 --> 50:50.080
Microsoft, I think, this is Chris here speculating, but I think Microsoft has realized that the

50:50.080 --> 50:52.240
future is not on Windows.

50:52.240 --> 50:55.440
The hot action for the future is not Windows.

50:55.440 --> 50:59.500
Perhaps maybe they even have some insights into what a shit show Windows is that we don't

50:59.500 --> 51:01.120
have on the outside.

51:01.120 --> 51:05.280
And so they fundamentally understand at a level that we can't even appreciate on the

51:05.280 --> 51:07.720
outside of why Windows is not our future.

51:07.720 --> 51:10.300
I'm just going to speculate here for a moment.

51:10.300 --> 51:12.080
Maybe I'm wrong.

51:12.080 --> 51:15.080
But they seem to be in a very awkward position.

51:15.080 --> 51:19.560
They can't just come right out and crap on Windows and say, Microsoft is no longer about

51:19.560 --> 51:21.280
Windows anymore.

51:21.280 --> 51:26.440
Microsoft is all about open source and Linux because they have a billion users on Windows

51:26.440 --> 51:28.880
who will go, well, what the hell, guys?

51:28.880 --> 51:30.520
What about us?

51:30.520 --> 51:33.960
At the same time, they can't come out and say, Windows is the best thing ever because

51:33.960 --> 51:37.560
they'll piss off all of the Linux and open source community, which is where they're trying

51:37.560 --> 51:38.560
to get to.

51:38.560 --> 51:43.200
However, we've had some experience here, and basically what we want to do is to not try

51:43.200 --> 51:46.360
and give a signal on any platform.

51:46.360 --> 51:50.200
As much as possible, what we want to do is we want to support all the platforms that

51:50.200 --> 51:53.920
somebody wants at the same time.

51:53.920 --> 51:59.200
So we had an exec that had come from Sun, and they said, yeah, so we're so committed

51:59.200 --> 52:03.760
to Solaris, and people thought, well, we're not committed to Linux.

52:03.760 --> 52:05.960
And so we said, you know what we're going to do?

52:05.960 --> 52:07.960
We're going to prove that we're committed to Linux.

52:07.960 --> 52:11.440
So we're going to do Linux a week before we release the Sun thing.

52:11.440 --> 52:15.200
And then their entire customer base said, oh, so you're not committed to Solaris anymore.

52:15.200 --> 52:17.600
It's like, oh, they just got it wrong.

52:17.600 --> 52:20.400
So we don't always get that right.

52:20.400 --> 52:24.800
But wherever we can, we're going to say, these are the platforms we want to support, and

52:24.800 --> 52:27.680
support them all at the same time.

52:27.680 --> 52:30.920
And then I suppose right now, from a lot of our perspectives on the outside, it's a bit

52:30.920 --> 52:35.400
of spinning up to Visual Studio Code's out now,.NET's out, PowerShell is out.

52:35.400 --> 52:38.320
It seems like a bunch of ketchup, but what this really is is going to just become the

52:38.320 --> 52:39.320
new normal.

52:39.320 --> 52:40.320
Yes, that's right.

52:40.320 --> 52:41.320
The new normal.

52:41.320 --> 52:42.320
Wow.

52:42.320 --> 52:43.320
So what is that?

52:43.320 --> 52:50.320
The new normal is they slowly bring a lot of things up to cross-platform over time.

52:50.320 --> 52:59.080
So PowerShell and OpenSSH come to Windows, and PowerShell comes to Linux and Mac, not

52:59.080 --> 53:03.240
because they just all of a sudden decided to flip a switch, but because they open-sourced

53:03.240 --> 53:04.240
.NET Core.

53:04.240 --> 53:07.240
And then they rebase PowerShell Core on.NET Core.

53:07.240 --> 53:08.720
You see where we're going here?

53:08.720 --> 53:10.440
I do.

53:10.440 --> 53:15.360
And with that, after they've laid the groundwork for.NET, and they've gotten developers on

53:15.360 --> 53:19.360
Git, and then once they've gotten developers understanding Git and taking pull requests

53:19.360 --> 53:22.200
and all of that, then they get them on Visual Studio Code.

53:22.200 --> 53:26.520
And once they have everybody on Visual Studio Code debugging the software, then they can

53:26.520 --> 53:29.680
launch PowerShell Core.

53:29.680 --> 53:32.240
And we go into more details in Coderadio.

53:32.240 --> 53:37.320
But the thing that they said, which I thought was pretty remarkable, is PowerShell Core,

53:37.320 --> 53:41.440
the version that's on Windows, and the version that's on Linux, and the version that's on

53:41.440 --> 53:45.920
Mac, is replacing standard PowerShell on Windows.

53:45.920 --> 53:47.640
So no more PowerShell on Windows.

53:47.640 --> 53:48.640
I mean, it's going to be there.

53:48.640 --> 53:49.840
They're going to maintain it.

53:49.840 --> 53:50.840
Right.

53:50.840 --> 53:51.840
Well, of course.

53:51.840 --> 53:55.320
But the version that's shipping on Linux is the future of PowerShell Core.

53:55.320 --> 53:58.680
Do you see what I'm saying?

53:58.680 --> 54:01.760
The version that's on Windows, the original version of PowerShell?

54:01.760 --> 54:05.880
I'm Joey Aiello, and I'm the program manager for PowerShell Core.

54:05.880 --> 54:10.440
And Joey here for PowerShell Core is the guy that's heading all of this up and helping

54:10.440 --> 54:15.880
them get ready to make this open source version to replace this version that's been shipping

54:15.880 --> 54:19.080
on only Windows for years.

54:19.080 --> 54:20.080
It's been phenomenal.

54:20.080 --> 54:21.080
Yeah.

54:21.080 --> 54:26.880
So we actually were proud to state that in the release of PowerShell 6 that roughly half

54:26.880 --> 54:30.960
of the pull requests that came in for PowerShell 6 were from the community.

54:30.960 --> 54:32.920
So they've open sourced PowerShell.

54:32.920 --> 54:38.280
They went with PowerShell Core 6, and they've had a pretty good engagement from the community.

54:38.280 --> 54:43.060
But I thought, you know, this was, I don't know, it's almost too perfect.

54:43.060 --> 54:45.200
So I wanted to ask them a few other questions about it.

54:45.200 --> 54:47.880
And I wanted to get specifically into bugs.

54:47.880 --> 54:51.680
So I'm going to replay this clip from the beginning and taking a perspective of what

54:51.680 --> 54:52.680
about bugs?

54:52.680 --> 54:54.840
What about people contributing issues back to PowerShell?

54:54.840 --> 54:55.840
It's been phenomenal.

54:55.840 --> 54:56.840
Yeah.

54:56.840 --> 55:02.680
So we actually were proud to state that in the release of PowerShell 6 that roughly half

55:02.680 --> 55:06.560
of the pull requests that came in for PowerShell 6 were from the community.

55:06.560 --> 55:11.200
In particular, we had a ton of work done in the web commandlets, the invoke web request

55:11.200 --> 55:17.520
and rest method layer by one contributor in particular, Mark E. Krause.

55:17.520 --> 55:23.240
There's also been a number of guys just sort of cleaning up the long tail.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.120
This is one of the great things about open source, right?

55:25.120 --> 55:29.520
You have people who know they need these really big features and are highly experienced and

55:29.520 --> 55:38.840
are able to code up all these custom rest method and authentication headers and proxy

55:38.840 --> 55:42.880
bypass and multi-part support and all these things in the web request layer.

55:42.880 --> 55:48.440
But then you have folks who say, hey, all your error messages still say Windows PowerShell,

55:48.440 --> 55:49.440
right?

55:49.440 --> 55:54.480
And someone who has a lot less coding experience is able to sort of jump into GitHub, make

55:54.480 --> 55:58.600
a contribution for the first time, scrub all these error messages and improve the product

55:58.600 --> 55:59.600
for everybody.

55:59.600 --> 56:05.000
And it's one of those things that we know is important but that we'd probably not get

56:05.000 --> 56:09.380
around to or if we did, something else would have to get sacrificed, right?

56:09.380 --> 56:13.880
And by having people who, the sort of Wikipedia approach, right, of like you have a thousand

56:13.880 --> 56:19.840
people fixing your typos, then you really end up with a much higher quality product.

56:19.840 --> 56:24.080
And we've seen a lot of that in PowerShell.

56:24.080 --> 56:28.360
And I think that 50% community PR number is a testament to that.

56:28.360 --> 56:29.360
Yeah, okay.

56:29.360 --> 56:30.360
So that is pretty good.

56:30.360 --> 56:31.360
Yeah.

56:31.360 --> 56:32.360
But I pushed Joey a little bit further.

56:32.360 --> 56:37.720
I'm like, okay, yeah, but there must have been some sort of esoteric typical open source

56:37.720 --> 56:39.960
community moment.

56:39.960 --> 56:44.280
And Jeffrey and Joey kind of both smile and they look at each other and go, well, there

56:44.280 --> 56:51.840
was the very first issue that came in that happened to be a bit memorable and it happened

56:51.840 --> 56:53.940
to be from the curl developer.

56:53.940 --> 56:58.160
So we're all sort of very happy and patting each other on the back.

56:58.160 --> 57:04.260
And about five or six hours later, a pull request came in from none other than the creator

57:04.260 --> 57:05.260
of curl.

57:05.260 --> 57:11.600
I'm going to get his name wrong, but his first name is Daniel.

57:11.600 --> 57:12.600
Really awesome guy.

57:12.600 --> 57:17.280
We had an email exchange afterwards and just a super nice guy.

57:17.280 --> 57:24.640
But the gist of the pull request was simply to remove two aliases from PowerShell.

57:24.640 --> 57:31.280
So some years ago, PowerShell had used a bunch of aliases for some of the core commandlets

57:31.280 --> 57:36.500
in order to entice or make things more comfortable for Linux users with no expectation at the

57:36.500 --> 57:38.580
time that PowerShell was going to ship on Linux.

57:38.580 --> 57:44.560
So for instance, ls was an alias as was dir for get child item to get the directory listing

57:44.560 --> 57:48.840
or even CD.

57:48.840 --> 57:52.760
So some of the aliases that were added were curl and wget.

57:52.760 --> 57:56.960
And those were there to draw users to invoke web request and invoke REST method.

57:56.960 --> 58:01.240
Well, the creator of curl, rightfully so, said, that's the name of my project.

58:01.240 --> 58:03.280
You're not invoking curl.

58:03.280 --> 58:06.560
Curl for Windows has been out for a very long time and you're making things really hard

58:06.560 --> 58:11.680
for my users who have to tack on.exe in order to run curl for Windows.

58:11.680 --> 58:17.240
So now that you're open source, you're trying to be good guys, add this back or remove this

58:17.240 --> 58:19.400
alias.

58:19.400 --> 58:22.680
And we responded in kind saying, hey, this is totally agree with you.

58:22.680 --> 58:23.960
This is a breaking change.

58:23.960 --> 58:28.600
We got to follow our governance process here that we had fortunately codified very explicitly

58:28.600 --> 58:31.080
and said this is our process for breaking changes.

58:31.080 --> 58:34.600
And he was very amenable and understanding of that.

58:34.600 --> 58:38.740
But within a few minutes of having posted that pull request, it was now number one on

58:38.740 --> 58:40.120
Hacker News.

58:40.120 --> 58:49.320
And we had GIFs and trolls, Michael Jackson eating popcorn, hundreds, like it took minutes

58:49.320 --> 58:52.120
to load in my browser kind of thing.

58:52.120 --> 58:57.160
So we got a very good lesson very early on on the importance of optics and how these

58:57.160 --> 59:02.740
things – it was these two aliases that really drove hundreds of people to our project.

59:02.740 --> 59:07.920
But ultimately I think we took care of it in a memorable way and we removed the aliases

59:07.920 --> 59:11.120
among a number of other aliases in PowerShell Core.

59:11.120 --> 59:15.000
We decided to leave them in Windows PowerShell for some period of time because users were

59:15.000 --> 59:16.000
depending on them.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.400
It's now best practice not to use aliases in scripts so that you're not depending

59:19.400 --> 59:22.240
on them.

59:22.240 --> 59:26.860
But the nice epilogue as we were saying to the story was that Curl is actually now available

59:26.860 --> 59:27.960
in Windows.

59:27.960 --> 59:33.280
So we need to go revisit that and yeah, in the next version of Windows we're shipping

59:33.280 --> 59:34.340
Tar and Curl.

59:34.340 --> 59:39.240
So yeah, we live in a brave new world for sure.

59:39.240 --> 59:41.840
A brave new world that ships Tar and Curl in Windows.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.600
Heck yeah.

59:43.600 --> 59:45.600
You know, I bonded with Joey.

59:45.600 --> 59:46.600
So Jeffrey –

59:46.600 --> 59:51.640
So that's where you get that pro license from, I see.

59:51.640 --> 59:57.440
What impressed me about Jeffrey is that he has been at Microsoft for 18 years.

59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.720
And we cover this in Coda Radio, again, sorry, obnoxious plug, but he talks about how he

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:05.980
went into Microsoft and created PowerShell with the intention of essentially trying to

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.080
rip off some of the stuff you can do in Bash.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.040
He's like, I even wrote a blog post about it.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.360
I've always acknowledged this.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.120
And it turned out it failed horribly.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:19.320
And then he totally talks about why it didn't work on Windows and it's super interesting

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:25.580
because it's much more about where Linux is now with JournalCTL and it's a great talk.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.580
Obnoxious plug one more time.

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:30.280
Go check out the whole interview because I really went down there for Coda Radio and

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.880
I grabbed that stuff for this show.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.040
I went down there.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:36.760
So go check out Coda Radio 296 where we have more.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:41.680
But I love talking to those guys because neither one of them thought they'd be Microsoft employees.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.680
And then they ended up there.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.040
Jeffrey's been there for about – Jeffrey's been there for 18 years.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.280
Joey's been there for four years.

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.800
And he and I were Gentoo users at the same time.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.760
So we – after we were done –

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.760
Kindred spirits.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.520
Yeah, we chatted about all of that and had a good chat.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:00.160
But JJ, I know you had some things you wanted to mention and I wanted to open it up to the

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.160
VLog for anybody else.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.960
But JJ, did you have something – I saw something go by that you wanted to start with.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.480
So I open it up to you, sir.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:15.280
So me personally, I am a dual booter still at this moment at this time in this conversation.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:21.720
And I also still pay attention to a lot of Windows news and it's not really a surprise

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.560
that Microsoft is embracing open source.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:32.720
Satya Nadella's – during the early days of Satya Nadella's tenure, he sort of emphasized

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:37.280
the future is with devices but not specifically Windows devices.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:43.880
And I do remember that presentation he had with that iPhone with Microsoft services on

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:44.880
it.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:48.720
And that was like a shock to a lot of – probably a lot of Windows geeks.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:55.520
And also with the fact that Windows Mobile is not really a viable option at this point

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.920
and other stuff like that.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:05.720
And there's also talks about also with the future of Windows 10 S and also with the rumor

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:08.040
Polaris devices.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:15.800
It seems that Windows seems to be less of a power user OS and more of a normal OS.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:22.680
But I'm not sure if like Linux will take – I mean Linux will probably take over the

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:25.200
power users to those who actually really want it.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:30.840
There are still those enterprises who sort of are not looking at Linux at the moment

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.040
and I'm sort of – it's sort of a mix.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.160
So I couldn't like put this in recording and play it as a clip.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:42.960
But the thing that I walked away with, the understanding that I managed to achieve, like

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:49.980
the meta understanding was – how do I put this in a way that's not insulting to myself?

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:56.100
So a lot of the stuff that I have sort of been calculating as a master stroke by Microsoft

01:02:56.100 --> 01:03:03.520
to sort of embrace and extend Linux isn't so much that as it is the result of about

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:10.080
three and a half years of people that used to be suppressed that now have a little more

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.520
leverage and certain people were laid off and made room for folks like Joey about four

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:21.000
years ago and guys straight out of college that were running Gentoo four years ago were

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000
allowed to come into Microsoft and run things like the PowerShell group.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.920
And they did a bit of a changing of a guard.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.520
And there were people like Jeffrey who's been there for 18 years who are always kind

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:39.040
of hip to – I'm coming here as a former Unix user and I want to bring Bash to Windows

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.400
– which is where PowerShell came from.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.240
So he was already kind of hip to the future direction.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:50.000
So folks like him now have assistants and their own corner office and their own people

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:56.120
working beneath them and they can summon podcasters like me to their office because they hold

01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.120
way more authority than they did under Balmer or Gates.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:06.040
And folks like Joey who's four years out of college are running the PowerShell core

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:12.640
group now and he's got people on his team where they run Max, that's all they do is

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.640
they use Max.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:17.880
He's got a guy on his team who runs Arch, he's got plenty of users, we talk about people

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:24.120
that are running Ubuntu because they're working on PowerShell which is a shell so they have

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:30.000
to be using it every single day to work out the things that shells do differently on different

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
operating systems.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.600
Absolutely and also I would like to say that I do have a connection to I think the head

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:43.520
of the Microsoft graph and he's an open source proponent and Linux user as well.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:49.040
Well I'm not sure if he's an open source proponent but he does use Linux.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:59.720
Yeah I kind of wonder if the big secret about Microsoft isn't anything that we've speculated

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:05.560
about like the thing that we've missed is the dirty secret, the elephant in the room

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:11.400
about Microsoft is they've moved beyond Windows before their customer base has.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.400
Oh yeah definitely.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.400
Right?

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.400
Very much.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.400
Yeah of course.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:21.520
But they're still making money from it so they can't say anything and it's super awkward

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.440
for them and so like you go down there and these guys are pretty enthusiastic about what

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:31.000
they're doing but they can't come right out and say Windows is the past because they'd

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.640
be happy for people to continue using Windows for the next 25 years.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.120
Go ahead they'll sell it to you.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:40.240
Yeah go ahead we'll ship it on Windows, we'll ship it on the web, we'll ship it on the Mac,

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.760
we'll ship it on Linux, we're happy to do it.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:52.200
They used a term that we go into more detail on QuotaRadio but they use a term called Ambient

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.680
Microsoft.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.020
Ambient Microsoft.

01:05:57.020 --> 01:06:03.520
They just want to be anywhere and everywhere that you might need them and he said Jeffrey,

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:13.520
the mission that was communicated to him by Saatchi directly, make it possible for our

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:19.240
customers to do more with their computers and our sales guys will figure out a way to

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.960
make money from it.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:27.360
So that was the directive, not make it work on Windows, not make it a platform lock-in,

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:32.440
figure out how to make them more money and get them to do more work with their computers

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:36.960
and our smart sales guys who we pay way too much money to will go out there and figure

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.360
out a way to nickel and dime them for it.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.200
So he's detached now from that and if you think about that, that's an interesting thing

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:48.680
because that's where PowerShell comes from on Linux because now Linux administrators

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:55.160
from their Linux, from their Ubuntu desktop can manage with one script an Ubuntu box and

01:06:55.160 --> 01:07:04.600
15 Linux servers and 15 Windows servers and 15 CentOS servers and 15 SUSE servers, right?

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.360
And a handful of Macs.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:12.320
All of these now can be managed from one script and they take care of all of the communications

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:21.400
between RPM and Debian or all the different implementation layer things.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.760
If you're a Windows shop and you've got a bunch of SUSE systems and Ubuntu systems and

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.880
CentOS systems, that's pretty valuable all of a sudden.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.480
Or you buy someone else and they have those systems.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.840
Which is actually something that happens more often than we talk about.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.840
Totally.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.840
Then you start to understand, oh, that's why it's ambient Microsoft, that's why they're

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:45.520
open sourcing.NET Core and PowerShell.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:50.800
Because then all of a sudden, when you're coming from a huge Microsoft infrastructure

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:56.280
and on-premises setup that's really deep in Windows, you can use some of your investments

01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:00.760
in scripts to administer your systems, to set up users, to create databases, to set

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.440
up patches.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:06.860
You can start to leverage that time across Linux systems.

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:11.400
And it can be on an Ubuntu, a SUSE, Fedora, CentOS machine.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:15.520
And the name attached to it, the brand attached to it, is Microsoft.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.560
Which is about as damn good as Google, Apple, and Microsoft.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.200
And then whether you need new infrastructure, be it Linux or Windows, you'll reach for their

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.200
cloud.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.580
I'm not sure where I sit with all of this, but I do recognize from a position of somebody

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:32.100
who was in the trenches trying to implement this stuff and when somebody would come at

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:36.040
you with, well, this is IBM Tivoli backup.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.680
It's made by IBM.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.780
So we should implement this.

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:40.780
And then we did it.

01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:44.260
And it was the worst freaking backup system we'd ever used.

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:49.080
And then later on down the road, well, Microsoft recommends that you should upgrade an NT4

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.400
network to Windows 2000 and definitely don't use this Linux thing.

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.840
And then that all of a sudden became a benchmark in which we were judged by.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:00.600
And it was this, you couldn't avoid the brand.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.880
Well now that brand can be used to manage Linux systems.

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:05.040
And they can be on-premises.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.440
They can be in Azure cloud.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.920
They can be on digital ocean.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.400
It doesn't matter.

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.400
And they don't care.

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:12.400
They don't care.

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.700
They legitimately don't seem to care.

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:18.280
If you want to run it on an Ubuntu box and you don't have any Windows systems on-premises,

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.920
but you want to use PowerShell, they're happy.

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:20.920
Go for it.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:21.920
Yeah.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.920
They're good with it.

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:23.920
Like, okay, we'll be there.

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.160
We're Ambi at Microsoft now.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.160
It's really something.

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.160
Just like the rain, man.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.160
Just like the rain.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.160
I don't know what to make of it.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.160
Yeah.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:35.000
They're basically taking the Pacific Northwest weather patterns and applying it to...

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.840
It's an interesting structure, too, for the business.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:44.760
Instead of building what the salesmen sell, the salesmen are selling what you create.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:49.120
It also leads to better products and all that from Microsoft.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:56.960
With regards to the Microsoft Garage experimenting on Android and iOS with many of their apps,

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:03.960
this idea sort of stemmed from their mobile give-up of Windows Mobile, I would say.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.160
Yeah.

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:10.480
I think after Windows Mobile kind of failed and Windows RT and all that stuff, and then

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:16.040
Satya Nadella takes over, there's just sort of this, all right, we'll figure out how to

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.560
make money at doing this.

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.880
That's just sort of been the drive.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.000
So I have a question.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.620
I'm actually seeing Microsoft moving away from providing an ecosystem with their operating

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:35.160
system to more something like providing infrastructure and projects regarding software that runs

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.160
maybe everywhere.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.160
Yeah.

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.160
Right.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.160
I would agree with that sort of summarization.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.160
Yes.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.160
Okay.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:47.040
But what about all the legacy software that is out there that relies on the Microsoft

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.040
Windows 10 code base?

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.040
Yeah.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.520
Then they're happy to keep making money from that, too.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.520
Yeah, sure.

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.240
But that's definitely not something that will change in a few years.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.240
No, I think that's...

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.240
That's not going away that quickly.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.240
I think that's why they're more than happy for the situation.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.240
That exact reason.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.240
Right.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.240
Yeah.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.240
And there's also the bridges such as...

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:05.240
Wait.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.240
Hold on.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.240
Let Producer Michael go.

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.240
Sorry.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.040
I was just going to say that Microsoft is compartmentalized.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:13.600
So yeah, this one group might be...

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.120
We want PowerShell to be everywhere.

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:19.960
We want Azure to have Linux and.NET is open source and all that stuff.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:20.960
Yeah.

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:23.440
But the other side is making Windows 10 and they're locking everything down.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:24.440
Yeah.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:25.440
There's different...

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:29.440
There's different priorities, there's different fiefdoms.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:37.880
However, I did genuinely get the sense that what they're cooking, everybody else is smelling.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:42.000
It starts with one or two projects and then it's something else in the company, then something

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.360
else and it does seem to be a bit of a snowball effect.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.920
But I'm not going to say you're going to tell you that they're going to open source Microsoft

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:48.920
Office.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.920
Right.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.920
But the autonomy is interesting, too, right?

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:51.920
It's more about...

01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.920
In some ways, it's about they weren't told no.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:57.160
It's like, oh, you want to make VS Code an Electron multi-platform and you're not using

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.340
Windows technology?

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:00.340
Not a problem.

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:02.840
And so that just gets fed back into the company.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:03.840
Yeah.

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:10.040
And now when they write the debugger for.NET Core, instead of it being a Visual Studio

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:15.020
only thing, it's something that they just sort of like open sourced and there's like

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:16.680
an Emacs plug-in.

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:20.680
You can do it in Vim, you can do it in Visual Studio Code, you can do it in Atom.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.680
It's just this...

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:22.680
All right.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:26.120
So they're going to see this approach and I think it's going to make them just a crap

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:27.120
ton of money.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.120
Yeah.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.120
Yeah.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.120
Yeah, it is.

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:31.120
It is.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:32.120
And they're going to get rich.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.120
They're going to make...

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:34.120
They're going to be...

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:38.260
They're going to be one of the biggest money makers off of open source.

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:40.640
Isn't that something?

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:43.280
They've gone from cancer to this.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.760
I mean, it was deep and, I mean, think about this.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.760
We need to move on.

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.760
But think about this.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.640
It was in the DNA of this company.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.840
Like Bill Gates goes to one of the computer clubs and says, you're devaluing software

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:56.840
by giving it away.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.840
He writes him...

01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.680
He writes this letter, a manifesto and says, we've got to stop giving away software.

01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.680
We've got to charge for it.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.440
I mean, it's in the DNA of the company.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:09.800
And then Bill Gates moves on, he goes and becomes whatever he is now.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:15.280
And Balmer takes over and it's all about Windows everywhere.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:19.560
It's all about Windows everywhere, Windows first.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.040
And now here we are, and Linux is a cancer when Balmer's running.

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.920
And now here we are with Saatchi and the people that have sort of been reshuffled underneath

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:30.480
Saatchi three or four years later, definitely feels like a different message.

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.480
What were you going to say?

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.480
Yeah.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.320
So it seems like Microsoft has got the Linux chemo in now.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.760
Yeah, right.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.760
They did, right?

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:39.760
Yeah.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:40.760
Nice.

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:45.940
I mean, wherever we're at, I think one of the bigger commentaries is the Linux Foundation

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:56.800
now will sell you a $300 course, a $300 course on administering Linux on Azure, LFS 205.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.060
It is a course from the Linux Foundation on using Linux on Azure.

01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:07.160
That's where we're at in 2018, is the Linux Foundation is selling you a $300 course on

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.160
that.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.160
I'm signing up right now.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:13.960
I mean, if that doesn't tell you where things have gotten in the last few years.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:16.080
So everybody's waiting around for it.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.720
I appreciate all you guys waiting.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.800
We're going to do our plasma check-in.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.800
You're running it.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.800
Yeah.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:22.800
I'm running it.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.800
I've been updating like crazy.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:24.800
Like crazy.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:25.800
Yeah.

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:26.800
You even did too.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.800
I thought you weren't going to update this.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:28.800
I don't know.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.360
For some reason, I thought you were on a different version or something.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.680
I thought I was too, but no, I've been keeping up better than I realized.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.200
Look at me.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.720
You know what, Wes?

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:38.720
This is what happens.

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:43.520
Wes either manages all his systems with this centralized management platform that can handle

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:49.320
millions of systems or he's just app get updating like a maniac and then a little upgrade here

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.360
and there and who cares, right?

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.360
You know it.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.360
I like how you roll, Wes.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:15:00.120
Well, so I've been trying out KDE Neon User Edition and other folks like, I think, Popey

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:05.840
and I know Noah have been trying out KDE Neon LTS Edition.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:15.440
Well, those evil planning sneaky jerks over at the Neon Project who have been setting

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:23.680
all of you LTS users up for ages, preparing you for a big, big trick, have pulled out

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:31.020
the rug from underneath you and devastated your lives by hiding the Neon LTS Edition.

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:36.160
So I gotta tell you, so every week, there's a couple of stories that I get a bunch of

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.440
feedback on or like links.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:42.720
And I actually am not saying this to stop any of it because sometimes it's actually

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.260
a very valuable data signal.

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:48.940
So I'm not disparaging those of you who did this, but I got a lot of telegrams and tweets

01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:54.720
and emails this week about, hey, Chris, did you see what they're doing?

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.340
Hey, did you see what they're doing, Chris?

01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.240
And they would send me the link to this blog post.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:04.880
It's short, it's one paragraph, it's one dense paragraph by Jonathan Riddle over at the Neon

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:05.880
blog.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:12.160
And it says this, with the new Plasma LTS came an update to KDE Neon LTS Edition and

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.960
lots of people asking which edition to use and what the difference is.

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:23.160
I'll say this too, by the way, once we announced the KDE Neon Plasma Challenge, the number

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:29.200
one question without any kind of like close competitor, the number one question that we

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:34.120
got was, are you doing the user edition or the LTS edition?

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.120
And what's the difference?

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:38.600
In fact, I would be willing to bet, producer Michael, is that not one of the number one

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:42.360
questions that's in the telegram group and then the community is, what's the difference

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:46.360
between the LTS edition and the user edition, yes?

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:52.280
That's the number one question I get every time someone ever mentions Neon at all.

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.920
And so I'm not surprised when I read that that was the number one question that came

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.320
into the project.

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.640
And so they say this caused us to review the purpose of the LTS and as a result, we've

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:05.880
just hidden it from the download page.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:09.880
So I wanna dig a little bit into this for a second because it has caused some people

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.160
to say, what's going on?

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.200
Why is the project abandoning their LTS?

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.200
What's going on with?

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.200
I don't know.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.200
Figure it out.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.720
Well, you know what we have figured it out.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.860
We have, and we'll tell you more about it here in just a moment.

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:27.440
But first, as we do here on the show, we gotta pay the bills, we gotta thank Linux Academy

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:32.000
and I gotta thank everybody for signing up at Linux Academy.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.400
You might notice that we have the same sponsors here on the show from time to time.

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:36.920
I don't know if you've noticed that or not.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:37.920
Have you noticed that?

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:38.920
Not at all.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.560
Yeah, I appreciate that a lot, Wes.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.560
No problem.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.560
I got your back.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.560
Yeah.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.560
Just like Linux Academy.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:46.720
Yeah, they do, don't they?

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.480
And here's why.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:55.240
We could spend our time researching show topics, contacting guests, building community, trying

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.640
out different infrastructure items.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:01.860
Or I could spend my time selling the show to different advertisers.

01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:03.840
And I could have mattresses on here.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:04.840
I could have food.

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:05.840
All the mattresses.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.840
Hey, what about HelloFresh?

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.200
Would you like to have some sleep?

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.200
That does sound fresh.

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.200
Yeah.

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.200
Well, there you go.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:15.040
And what I've decided to do instead is I've decided to invest in certain sponsors that

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.280
are genuine fits for our audience.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.640
Like Linux Academy.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:24.320
I honestly know that all of us can use this service.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.420
I'm a subscriber, so I can say that with confidence.

01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:32.200
They give you advanced training tools to increase your skills and encourage critical thinking

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.640
around everything about Linux.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:37.000
So think about that for a moment.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.020
That's where they start, right?

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:40.020
That's where they start.

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:42.640
So that's going to make you super competitive in the industry.

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.720
And then they give you the tools to accomplish this, like hands-on labs, scenario-based labs.

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:50.640
They'll spin up virtual machines if it's AWS or if it's a local Linux box.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.120
You can SSH into that and get a hands-on experience.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.840
They have human beings, actual instructors that can help you whenever you get stuck.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:01.000
They have self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux, cloud, and DevOps topic.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.200
And my favorite freaking feature about Linux Academy is their course scheduler.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:13.200
Because I've got three kids, I run my own business, and I fancy myself a road tripper.

01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:16.200
So when the hell am I going to get any kind of studying done?

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.000
When am I ever going to learn about new things?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.680
Well, my friends, Linux Academy has a course scheduler.

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:24.840
You pick what she wants to do.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:27.160
You set your time frames, and they'll help you stick to it.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:30.920
If you want reminders or goals, you want to download the study guides, they'll help you

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.640
do all of that.

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:36.280
And then when you're ready to take the exam, they've got testing for that too.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.360
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:42.000
Go there, sign up for a free seven-day trial and support the show.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.600
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.600
And a big thank you to Linux...

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.600
I know, right?

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:51.400
A big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.400
Okay.

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.560
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:58.040
So guys, let's do our plasma updates.

01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:00.740
Let's do our plasma check-in.

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:04.960
Because I thought this would be like a big production, because we made a big deal about

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.560
it last week.

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:11.120
And now that we're here, I just have a big...

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.200
This is what I'm doing now.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.120
This is how I'm doing it from now on.

01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.080
It's just sort of now my life.

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:19.960
I don't have like a, oh man, plasma totally failed me story.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.680
I don't have anything like that.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.260
It's just a big, this has been great.

01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:29.320
And I would say I like it better today than I did the week before and the week before

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.320
that.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.320
Is that right?

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.320
Yeah.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.320
Why?

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:37.060
Well, the 5.12 upgrade was solid for me.

01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:39.600
And I think you experienced this today too.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:45.440
When I move between machines, and then I open up console, and it's been like a week since

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:50.200
I've opened up console, and that son of a bitch opens up in the same exact place that

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:51.200
I opened...

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:52.200
You know what I'm talking about.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.200
I sure do, yes.

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.200
It opens up in West.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.200
It's just right there.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.200
Right where I left it.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:20:59.080
Right where my memory goes, where my muscle memory goes.

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:01.440
It's like super small stuff like that.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.120
I mean, it's that times a thousand.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:08.360
I know that seems stupid and small, but if you added up to all of the stuff, like the

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:13.600
quadrant tiling, when I'm moving my windows around, and the way it snaps, then I can resize,

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:16.440
it just works so damn fast and efficient.

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.560
I can't even help myself.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:20.680
You feel like you're coming home a little bit more?

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:21.680
Yeah.

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:22.680
It's like mom's cooking.

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:26.280
It was nice, but it was more like I was using a public terminal and I kind of spun up a

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:27.280
new shelf.

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:28.280
You know what?

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.280
Here's what it is, West.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.760
Gnome is like me living out in the city.

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:33.320
I'm out living in the city.

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.480
It's clean.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.840
There's a lot of different delivery services.

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.480
It's kind of got like a coldness to it.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.700
That's gnome.

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:41.700
That's gnome.

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:47.480
But like plasma, plasma is like coming home to mom's cooking.

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:48.680
Get it out of here.

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.600
And it just is delicious.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.540
It just works the way I want it every time I come back to it.

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:57.200
You know, it's just the same thing mom's been making me for the last three weeks.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.200
And if it's-

01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.400
Cheesy goodness right there on top.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:04.960
And if I haven't gotten, I'm going to underball this.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:06.460
Everybody likes to exaggerate on the internet.

01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:08.920
I'm going to under exaggerate here for a second.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:16.480
I've gotten a hundred different tweets and telegrams and emails and I'm under exaggerating.

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:21.080
And I would say eight out of 10 are switching.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.080
Wow.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.080
Yeah.

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:26.080
I would say there's a couple that are like not working for me.

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:31.480
In fact, the number one thing I think I've heard because it's about five of them is they're

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.480
going back to cinnamon.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.480
Cinnamon.

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:35.480
Interesting.

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:36.480
Cinnamon.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.480
Cinnamon.

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:38.480
I know.

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.480
Right?

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:40.480
Okay.

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.480
I know.

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.480
I mean, I've enjoyed cinnamon a lot.

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.480
Me too.

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.480
Me too.

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.480
Me too.

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.480
Me too.

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.480
Me too.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.480
It's just funny though.

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.480
It is funny, right?

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:50.480
Okay.

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:51.480
I'm not trying to laugh at them.

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:52.480
No, no, no, no, no.

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.480
I'm not.

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:54.480
I'm not.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:55.480
I'm not.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:56.480
Because I've been there.

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.480
But it is like a weird one.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.480
Cinnamon.

01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.480
Anyways.

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:11.080
You said them like a mate link at the end.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:15.480
So I want to go around the horn here and I want to start with Mr. Neonpoby because I've

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.280
gotten a lot of different people interested in this.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:21.120
But the one I'm most curious in is, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, Poby.

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:26.480
But I think you and I were both like Unity 7 for life before this experiment.

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.480
Correct?

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:31.760
Yeah, I'm not a distro hopper by any stretch.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:34.960
Like I've used Unity for years and years and before that I used Nome 2.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:40.640
I've used Ubuntu forever since it's existed and before that Debian and before that Red

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.640
Hat.

01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:42.640
So we're talking a very, very long time ago.

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.320
So I just don't switch distro at all.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:50.160
And that's not because I'm employed by Canonical, but I didn't switch before I started working

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.160
at Canonical.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.840
That's a big waste of work and time.

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:53.840
Like that stuff.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:54.840
Right.

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.840
It's getting used to new stuff.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:56.840
You got kids.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:01.360
It's like, you know, that whole question about why do you use what you use, it's because

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.360
I like it.

01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:07.400
It's not because the competition is terrible or because other things, you know, have awful

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.400
workflows.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.400
It's just I like the workflow that I have.

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:13.520
So everyone else who hates it, fair enough, use something else.

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:14.520
I like this.

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.520
Yeah.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.520
Well said.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.520
I like Unity 7.

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:22.680
So yes, I have been, you know, Unity 7 for life, Unity 7 Master Race and all that stuff.

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:29.280
But you suggested KDE Neon, so I thought I'd give it a go.

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:31.600
Now here we are.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.000
You and I are over two weeks, really, in how long we've been using this, but it's a solid

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.400
two weeks.

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.400
What is your thoughts?

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:45.960
If you don't count the faffing around on the plane, yeah, I'm still using it.

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:50.160
I'm talking to you now from a mumble snap on KDE Neon like I was last week.

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.160
Still works.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:55.600
I don't even think I've rebooted since last week, I don't know.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.880
But yeah, it just works.

01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:03.640
It wakes up super fast when I open the lid and all my windows refresh and like you said,

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:10.020
you open console and it opens in exactly the same place, the same size, same font size.

01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:12.560
Everything just remembered where it was.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:15.000
Yeah, everything seems to be working.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.480
I didn't have quite as smooth experience as you did with the upgrade to 5.12.

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.480
Really?

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.980
You went from 5.8 to 5.12.

01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:26.840
You got it the day before I did.

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.840
I went from 5.11.

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.640
No, that's not why.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:36.120
So you did it the day before I did and I got it pretty soon after the next day.

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:41.680
The problem I had was their server went down while I was midway through an upgrade or they

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:47.600
rebooted it or it had an outage or it was just, let's be favorable and say it was super

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:54.160
popular because there were lots of people joining us on this journey and lots of people

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.600
are upgrading at the same time.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.600
Could be.

01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:01.720
That's entirely plausible and so I got network disconnections connecting to their server.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.200
We unplugged them.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.200
Oh.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.200
Yeah.

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.040
But all I did was wait a little while and restart the upgrade and it carried on fine.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.080
So no problem.

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.040
I've upgraded to 5.12 and everything seems ticky-dee-boo.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.040
Yeah.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:20.720
So they're hiding the LTS version and my sense of it, and producer Michael, I'd like to hear

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:26.120
your take on it because I know you've been watching the situation, is my sense of, well,

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:31.600
there was some bugs in the LTS version specifically around Discover software that we just didn't

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.560
catch because nobody on the team is using it so we don't really want to put it forward.

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:40.680
The LTS version is still going to exist, the repositories are still getting updated.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:46.280
The main difference between the LTS version and the user edition is that the LTS version

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:49.560
ships plasma LTS.

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:55.280
User edition ships current plasma with the current Ubuntu LTS.

01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:00.360
But wasn't there some sort of issue with Discover that sort of brought all of this to a front?

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.480
It's an issue with Discover every time they make a new version.

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:04.480
Is there really?

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:05.480
See, I didn't know that.

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.160
Is this like a common thing?

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:08.160
Discover is a...

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.040
I mean, someone who's a plasma fan, Discover is annoying.

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:12.040
Yeah.

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:15.600
I mean, it's one of those features that's really kind of nebulous because it's built

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.800
for this supposed new user, right?

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:18.800
I mean...

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:24.480
Discover has amazing ideas and concepts, it's just they're not fully flushed out yet.

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:29.040
So there's a lot of annoyances in that case.

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:34.560
But as far as this goes, it's really a Discover problem.

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:36.520
The main thing is that there's people not using it.

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:42.160
The developers don't use it, so they put so little attention into it, it doesn't really

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.160
make sense for them to do it.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.160
Bugs slip in there.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.120
Honestly, I never thought they should have done it in the first place because it defeats

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.120
the point of neon.

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:49.120
Right.

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:50.120
Yeah.

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:54.600
Because if you're going to roll your entire stack on top of a LTS base, why make part

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:57.120
of that stack stop rolling for some reason?

01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:05.680
I'd say I haven't had any issues with Discover and I almost never open it.

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:10.120
As I mentioned last week, I installed half a dozen snaps and I'm done.

01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.460
I've got every application I need on this system and anything, any additional libraries

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:17.700
or command line tools, I'll use AppGet to install.

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:23.940
The only time I've opened Discover is when I saw a notification that told me I had some

01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:24.940
updates to do.

01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:29.520
So I clicked it and Discover opened and I pressed apply and they ran and then I closed

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.760
the window and it went away and I was perfectly fine.

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:35.960
Discover 5.12 is 10 times better than 5.11.

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:36.960
Oh, nice.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:37.960
Oh, really?

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:38.960
Yeah.

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.640
It's just that some people who are using the older versions, if you did a full upgrade

01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:47.980
from Discover 5.11 or 5.8, it might not go as smoothly.

01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:51.480
But if you use 5.12 to do any updates, it's perfectly fine.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:56.200
I've done updates with Discover just to test it to see if it would do the full thing and

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.820
it most of the time works.

01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:01.040
But when it fails, it fails badly.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.000
That's why it's not reliable.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.000
I would just say it's like, well, 5.12 is so far.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.980
I just don't think people should use the super old stuff anyway.

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:16.560
That's why I never really liked the plasma LTS anyway.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.560
And they're not getting rid of it, right?

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.200
Yeah, because they're still testing against it.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:21.200
Yeah.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:22.320
They still use it for development.

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:28.720
When I did the plasma video, I had to do some benchmarking so that was perfect that they

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:30.960
had it so I could use 5.8.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:37.340
But other than that, I mean, I wouldn't bother with it because the fact that you get the

01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:41.840
stable upgrades from all the different plasma versions is great.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.660
I've done multiple tests, multiple machines.

01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:50.000
Plasma never crashes on any updates from any version, so there's no reason not to just

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.480
use the regular Neon.

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:56.320
Yeah, I actually agree, especially from an end user standpoint.

01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:01.280
I'll tell you where I can see the purpose of an LTS version of plasma, and that's when

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:03.040
it comes to enterprise distros.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:08.840
Now, take that for a second and then let's sort of zoom out.

01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:12.840
A lot of the people that are talking here have been using desktop Linux for longer than

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:15.520
15 years.

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:18.600
So we all kind of have some standing in this area.

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.760
Popi, were you going to say something?

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:21.760
No.

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:30.880
No, and we're all saying this is working for us, and we're all saying this seems to use

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:36.440
less resources despite the plasma is bloated myth.

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:38.920
It seems to be waking from sleep faster.

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:40.440
It seems to be more stable.

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.080
It remembers my settings and it crashes less.

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:47.920
And like in Popi's case, he doesn't even think he's had to reboot in the last week.

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.040
I don't think any of us are saying it's perfect.

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:53.320
I don't think any of us are saying it doesn't have about a thousand defaults you might have

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.320
to change.

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:57.320
Yeah, I just checked.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:01.840
I've got an uptime of six days and 13 hours.

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.160
So no, I haven't updated since last week's show.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:06.160
Yeah.

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:07.160
And you know, let me see.

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:10.600
So this machine here that I do every single show for Jupiter broadcasting on currently

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:16.400
has, yeah, this has an uptime of five days with three users.

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:20.040
And I think that's only because I updated, I rebooted after I updated at 512 five days

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.040
ago.

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:22.880
And this is like a common thing I do.

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:26.200
I tend to leave my, I like leaving all my windows open.

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:30.320
I just slam the lid shut, open it up when I want to carry on.

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:36.280
And I like, I quite like having quite long uptimes and I like systems that are robust

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:37.720
that can cope with that.

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:40.960
This is the fricking elephant in the room and we have to go cause ask Noah's coming

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:41.960
up.

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:49.440
And I'm like, you guys, like, so why is Gnome the desktop, the shipping on all of the enterprise

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:54.400
distros that are going to be supported until the middle of the 2025s or whatever?

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.400
What is it?

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.680
Why is it on plasma?

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.380
Legacy and branding.

01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:04.960
People have known about Gnome for so long that just it has the market share, it has

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:11.680
the recognition, the whole KDE's bloated thing that's been going around for years, which

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:15.400
has never been true at all at any point.

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:25.400
And like people just kept saying it, there was one bug in 4.3 no 4.2 of plasma that made

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:31.400
it sluggish for about four weeks until they replaced it, replaced it with 4.3 and at that

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:33.320
point forward it was fine.

01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:38.840
But that one thing just created this weird onslaught of just bad reputation for KDE,

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:46.040
bad reputation and it doesn't make any sense other than weird legacy, weird reputation

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:52.560
and kind of bad branding because KDE isn't the name of the desktop and that's it's still

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:56.360
the most common phrase describing the desktop.

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:59.200
So they need to fix their branding.

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:08.260
I'd say probably the reason why people choose or projects have chosen Gnome is probably

01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:13.040
because there's a billion dollar company behind it.

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:19.880
Like most of the, if you ask any person in the street who's behind Gnome, they'd say

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:20.880
Red Hat.

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:26.720
They wouldn't say a community of developers, which they might say for KDE or plasma, they'd

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:34.400
say there's a community, nobody knows who Blue Systems are or how much money they have

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:39.880
in the bank, but Red Hat are a well-known company, long established, well-respected

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:43.600
company who are behind the Gnome project.

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:46.880
So I think that's a reasonable reason why people choose Gnome.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.680
Yeah, I think that's it and that seems pretty reasonable to me.

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:56.280
The only problem is that we are heading full head, full steam ahead into Gnome.

01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:00.600
Even though a lot of us in this room who've had a lot of years doing this are saying maybe

01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:04.320
and I think that's why we see a lot of projects like Solus and elementary OS that are trying

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:08.520
something a little different to try to strike that difference and Ubuntu MATE and the MATE

01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:09.520
project itself.

01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:14.360
Also, I bet you something to do as far as like the technical aspects, there's been a

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.680
longer thing about of Qt.

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:19.720
People had a problem with Qt licensing and stuff and they didn't want to deal with that

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:20.720
maybe.

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:21.720
True.

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:22.720
Yeah, that's a good point.

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.720
Yeah, that didn't help.

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:24.720
I don't know.

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:26.320
It's not a zero sum game.

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:28.480
For KDE to be good, Gnome doesn't have to be bad.

01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:29.480
Yeah, exactly.

01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:31.600
For Gnome to be good, KDE doesn't have to be bad.

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.280
They can both be good in their own right.

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:34.280
Absolutely, 100%.

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.600
It just happens to be that Plasma is good and Gnome is bad.

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:37.600
Oh, no, no.

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.600
Come on.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:39.600
It was so good there.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.680
It could have been the perfect ending and then you took it from us.

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:44.960
But I actually, I want to echo that point.

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.440
I think Popeye is completely right.

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:50.560
And it may be that they excel at different things and that the mass market perhaps Gnome

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:54.440
works well and KDE works better when you have a foot in the game a little bit more.

01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.440
Yeah.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:59.100
Either way, I think a lot of us are sticking around on the Plasma desktop, which is pretty

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.200
awesome if you think about it.

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.640
That's going to be, I don't know.

01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.840
It's a big switch for a lot of us.

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:05.840
A new era.

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:32.840
It is a new era.
