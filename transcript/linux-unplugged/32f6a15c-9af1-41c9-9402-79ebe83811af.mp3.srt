1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
anybody had a chance to catch my new video series you guys seen the new the

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,360
new video series I launched I think I've done three videos three videos are out

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,960
now we're just now getting to Berkeley and at meet BSD so I've got a question

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,160
for you sir and what why have you struck out with your own individual YouTube

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,960
track channel excuse me well because it's a couple of things is I have good

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:26,380
question I have been I've been over the last year I've become more of a YouTube

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,640
content consumer you know I've always just sort of viewed YouTube as the place

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
that is it's like another RSS feed we just dump we give it we put another dump

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,720
of our stuff on YouTube and I haven't given a lot of thought to how people

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,280
actually watch content on YouTube and so as I started watching more and more my

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,600
content on YouTube because I don't have any other really great way to watch

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,200
current daily television and I got the Android TV and it just sort of changed

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,960
how how I how I consume YouTube and I realized that I don't like the channels

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,240
that post all kinds of stuff political stuff development stuff tech news stuff

15
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,880
Linux stuff it's like it's too much it's I when I sit down and watch the

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,360
television I like I'm kind of an eminent I'm gonna track I have something I want

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,240
to watch and so because this wasn't technical it's not really about Linux

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,400
it's not about information security or networking it's it's just it's really

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,240
more about me and it gets more personal as it goes on it sort of felt like I

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,040
would be disrespecting the subscribers of the Jupiter broadcasting channel

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,540
because I was sort of dumping something in their feed that wasn't why they

22
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,440
subscribe to Jupiter broadcasting they subscribe for technical content oh and

23
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,040
here's ten videos which are tangently connected to technical content but only

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,120
for a small percentage of them enjoy it just but people like it and so it just

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,920
felt like it was probably more appropriate to do something that was

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,920
like this on my own channel and and then if there is probably I don't know yet

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,720
but long term if there seems to be a lot of interest and it's worth a lot of

28
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,680
effort on my part I would probably continue to produce it as a side channel

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:15,120
to Jupiter broadcasting that's more like this the show behind the shows this is

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,360
Lennox Unplugged episode 173 for November 29th 2016

31
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,880
Oh welcome to Lennox Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's got a random craving

32
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,760
for curry and beer my name is Chris my name is Wes hello Wes yeah you've got me

33
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,400
hungry let's be honest Wes we have a newspack show and and Chris has been

34
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,760
complaining for the last few weeks hasn't he yes it's the dearth of the

35
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,400
news what's going on but now we've got it's back I guess everybody was just on

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,600
Halloween break I'm not sure what Thanksgiving break now they've got their

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,560
food they've got fresh energy they're making they're all back and they're

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,180
making tons of open source updates we're gonna cover a lot of them coming up on

39
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,280
this week's show we're gonna start with like the only non Linux stuff that's

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,720
worth talking about just right here at the top we're gonna take our medicine

41
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,400
and then moving on into the show did you hear about the core VLC developer who

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,800
says no one cares about Linux that hurts it did hurt and apparently it hurt him

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,040
too just as much we'll tell you why plus Debian is making a big change Ubuntu is

44
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,960
gonna go with a rolling hardware kernel what is that really what's happening

45
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,840
we'll tell you about that snaps have some nice updates coming along we'll get

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,360
a little state of the snap the new XPS is out but there could be some big

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,000
limitations and then we're gonna get super nerdy with Wes we're gonna talk

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,200
about net data net data back ends data miner DB and all the crazy stuff he's

49
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,000
been working on in his day job recently you know what I'm really looking forward

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,820
to this because Wes you know we don't I don't know if it comes up in the show

51
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,080
very much but you are heads down in this stuff all the time and you're working on

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,080
some of the most buzzword heavy stuff that we talk about ain't that it is

53
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,120
actually your day job so we're gonna talk a little bit about that then also

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,560
just sort of a heads up for noobs on managing devices in Linux and then last

55
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,720
but not least I'd like to round out the show with a classic conversation it came

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,640
up in light of the fedora 25 review we did and that is upgrade versus nuke and

57
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,680
pave when you're doing a new install or like a new release or etc etc so

58
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,920
obviously if you just watch this week's episode Linux action show I'm referring

59
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,040
to my upgrade from fedora 24 to 25 I've gotten a ton of feedback and by feedback

60
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,920
I mean extreme criticism one nice probing like hey Chris why did you

61
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,280
choose to do it this way and about 95 you moron so we're gonna we're gonna

62
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,320
talk about those and talk about upgrade versus a new campaign because I think

63
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,080
that's sort of a classic that we really haven't tackled much on this show so

64
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,440
there's a ton of stuff to get into I did mention we have some veggies so to help

65
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,040
us chew on these let's bring in that virtual lug timer appropriate greetings

66
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:06,000
mumble room sandwich in there and I am hungry I don't know I don't know you

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,680
know I get some child Chris I do you're right I oh well Wes has helped hooking me

68
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,760
up though he brought in like this cozy sweater brew which is from Iron Horse

69
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,120
brewery which that sounds kind of interesting cozy sweater a vanilla milk

70
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,840
stout it's rich it's not too heavy I think where's this one from here canned

71
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:34,760
and brewed by Iron Horse brewery in Washington hey Ellensburg you have yet

72
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,320
to bring something outside the Pacific Northwest there was one the the Melvin

73
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,480
but wasn't in the Pacific Northwest all right I won't but that was a really good

74
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,760
beer so there has to be an exception so I'm gonna give it a go I'm gonna give it

75
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:55,280
a hold on survey says beer is delicious that's a great beer that's quite tasty I

76
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,520
might say that beer is tasty Wes thank you very much cheers to Linux so this

77
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,160
headline is a little revolting this I I'm not gonna do I'm not gonna decry

78
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,960
fake news but this headlines a little much Microsoft is telling developers

79
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,440
whatever you're doing in Linux soon Windows 10 will do it and better

80
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,840
whatever Linux can do we can do better the tech giant Nick Heath writes lays

81
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,920
out its plans for the future of Ubuntu and bash on Windows 10 there's a couple

82
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,880
of interesting little tidbits in here I thought we might cover mm-hmm it's laced

83
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,200
with this language that I find myself exhausted by and I'm really hoping as we

84
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,720
move on people can stop speaking and writing like this and you know it's

85
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,840
sentences like this the firm recently updated Windows 10 to let users run a

86
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,700
range of Linux tools from inside the OS the firm the firm being yet another way

87
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,880
to refer to the tech giant which is another way to refer to the company in

88
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,400
Redmond which is another way to refer to Microsoft I'm so sick of it and then it

89
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,880
goes into this this sentence structure that implies that Microsoft were the

90
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,360
ones to create this Windows 10 runtime that Microsoft did the development work

91
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,960
when it was canonical that did the heavy lifting there Microsoft did the kernel

92
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,400
enablements but that stuff was there for other compatibility layers they've had

93
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,240
in the years past and the previous version of this sentence it wrote the

94
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,260
firm quietly updated Windows 10 to let users run quietly updated and they

95
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,160
removed the quietly since since we first started and it's just kind of that's

96
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,640
that's obnoxious but they say whatever this is a quote from a Microsoft

97
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,560
representative whatever it is that you normally do on Linux to build an

98
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,520
application whether it's in go Erlang or in C whatever you use please give it a

99
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,200
try on bash on Windows and they also want you to file bugs they say you know

100
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,320
it's a big part of it the article goes on to say forthcoming updates some of

101
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,220
which already available to those using the early builds of Windows 10 under the

102
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,320
insider program includes support for Ubuntu 1604 hey more Linux tools like

103
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,160
IF config and ping so you can which is really nice because there's a lot of

104
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,000
tools that rely on IF config to get information so if you don't have IF

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,920
config a lot of other tools don't work the other major new addition will be

106
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,640
increased interoperability between bash and Windows environments effectively

107
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,920
this will let developers call Windows applications from within bash well

108
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,720
allowing them to write a bash script to automate complex builds that include

109
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,120
Windows applications and to invoke bash applications from Windows PowerShell

110
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,000
this all makes me feel very funny inside Chris so all of this is moderately nice

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,800
right good for them at one point is Microsoft advocating that you stop using

112
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,120
Linux and switch to Windows because the headline says Microsoft tells devs

113
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,520
whatever you're doing in Linux Windows 10 will do soon too the tech giant lays

114
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,080
out his plans for the future of Ubuntu on bash on Windows 10 the only thing the

115
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,600
guy said is whatever it is that you normally do on Linux to build an

116
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,240
application whether it's in go Erlang or C whatever you use please he says please

117
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,360
comma give it a try on bash on Windows that's that's a very that's right it

118
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,640
seems like really they just want users and they want to make it better which I

119
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,080
mean yeah perhaps with no ill intent I mean were you gonna say something I was

120
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,760
gonna say Windows does it better except for running dotnet and SQL Server Linux

121
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,120
apparently does that call out to a Linux action show story week yeah dotnet got

122
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,160
that dotnet team was starting to run stuff on Linux and was surprised by 2x

123
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,880
performance improvement before the identity optimization this is another

124
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,440
kind of story like I said we just got a couple of non-linux stories that are

125
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,080
kind of Linux related here at the top can I just say yeah good I am sick of

126
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,960
them calling it bash for Windows when they implemented the Linux kernel

127
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,080
compatibility layer and they're still just calling it bash it just seems so

128
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,600
weird do you think they should be calling it for Linux when should they

129
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,840
call for Ubuntu on Linux I don't know it depends on what their ultimate goal is

130
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,640
yeah they might just want to call it like a Linux compat layer because that's

131
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,480
exactly what it is the technology is called Windows subsystem for Linux yeah

132
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,600
that's its actual name I'm just it's the people calling it bash for Windows but

133
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,400
actual Microsoft representatives are saying bash on window a better say bash

134
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,840
on WSL or something like that they say bash on Ubuntu on Windows that's how

135
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,520
it's pitched not in that article though all the ZS users really hurt I do

136
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,560
actually feel like Ubuntu should get more prominence not only because it's a

137
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,600
name brand that people recognize but also because it is the Ubuntu user land

138
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,960
you're using and they did a lot of the work to you know help make this happen

139
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,480
seems weird to lean on to leave it's not like I mean I've seen arch running on

140
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,320
there but I'm not seeing I'm not seeing a lot of people running anything but a

141
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,240
boot to at this point and if you're doing anything in production you're

142
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,120
gonna be using the official image from Microsoft like bootstraps the Ubuntu

143
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,360
image and gets apt working everything whereas like getting another environment

144
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,280
working is incredibly painful the way they've set it up so far so there was a

145
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:54,200
bug on Azure that specifically affected Red Hat instances did you see this mm-hmm

146
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,280
this is a thing that I guess Amazon had probably engineered around because of

147
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,880
their long experience but every now then you know I mean as you're in some senses

148
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,360
is a newer platform right and the vulnerability was discovered by an Irish

149
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,560
software engineer called Ian Duffy Ian Duffy I'm sorry I bet how how how how

150
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,000
great would have been if it was I key right I mean how good that would have

151
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,920
been amazing that would 100% anyway so I key discovered and reported on my to

152
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,760
Microsoft as part of its bug program I key discovered that the glitch while

153
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,160
working a while that while working on a hardened Red Hat Enterprise Linux for

154
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,520
use on both Amazon Web Services and Azure now here's what it was kind of

155
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,720
interesting is because part of the spec you should have operated under a

156
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,440
metered billing pricing model consuming software updates from a local Red Hat

157
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,200
Enterprise Linux repository owned and managed by Azure or Amazon depending on

158
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,760
what you're using mm-hmm both AWS and Azure utilize deployment of the Red Hat

159
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,000
update infrastructure places super boring I'm sorry anyways he noticed that

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
some Red Hat packages RPMs contained client configurations for each reason

161
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,160
region on Azure from this he was able to discover all the URLs for all of the

162
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,760
regional reddit update applications on Azure and obtain access to archives

163
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,080
containing log files configuration files and SSL updates and they could be used

164
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,960
to gain full administrative access to the update appliances he said that

165
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,640
despite the applications requiring usings and password-based authentication

166
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,440
it was possible to execute and run their back-end log collector on a specified

167
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,080
content delivery server when the collector service completed the

168
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,520
application supplied URLs to archives which would then contain multiple logs

169
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,560
and configuration files from the servers he said it might have also been able to

170
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,400
get access to the storage accounts because he was able to read all of the

171
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,000
information in those logs Microsoft has since taken action to prevent public

172
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,920
access to log monitoring application and the Red Hat update appliances but it's

173
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,560
not really known if anybody ever exploited these particular vulnerabilities

174
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,920
in the wild so he's looking around seeing these RPMs these RPMs have all of

175
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,760
the source URLs for the main servers he then goes to the main servers discovers

176
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,120
the logs are available from by reading the law you can just grab those files he

177
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,920
gets the whole map of the Azure Network and starts getting access to the systems

178
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,680
it's probably pretty hard to run a cloud it's like they're getting better at it

179
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,040
but there's always these little problems you know what else is hard and that like

180
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,000
I said just we're just gonna talk about a couple of these we're not gonna spend

181
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,200
a lot of time on this but damn it this pisses me off so much this pisses me off

182
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,480
so damn much Android is hard especially the security on it and this is an

183
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,920
article that is probably worth your time and the you may have seen the headline

184
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,440
floating around Android security in 2016 is a mess he points out the obvious

185
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,120
vendors like LG Samsung you know me etc after selling you the phone have no

186
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,080
incentive to keep your phone software up to date with Google's fixes and

187
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,840
everybody knows this and he goes in and makes some really brilliant points in

188
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,680
here this talks out it talks about the media tech and blue phones that were

189
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,760
available on Amazon they were uploading all of your information oh right I goes

190
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,400
into how the A-list phone makers manage he talks about how Google's incentives

191
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,640
don't really stack up either and then when we get to the what can we do

192
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:59,920
segment of the article he says if money is no object my only sound advice can be

193
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,680
to buy an iPhone Apple is still shipping security updates albeit iOS 9 for the

194
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,400
iPhone 4s which was released in 2011 that's five years ago kids the iPhone

195
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,720
5 is still being kept up to date with iOS 10 furthermore then you look at the

196
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:21,240
things like encryption implementations iOS 4 released six years ago was already

197
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,400
more advanced than the encryption in Android 7 Nougat released in August of

198
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,880
this year in short already Apple has made better choices and how exactly

199
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,680
different files are encrypted while Android went for a whole disk

200
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,560
encryption which tanked battery life tanked CPU performance nobody used it

201
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,440
all the OEMs disabled it yeah exactly and Android's finally gone its file

202
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,320
base but they're actually not even doing that and they're not encrypting

203
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,360
important parts of users data which is detailed in another blog post so he says

204
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,440
if you're gonna go Android if you're gonna stick with Android you got to go

205
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:05,840
pixel or Nexus so mr. pixel um why didn't you get an iPhone you know I've

206
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,320
had an iPhone before I had an iPhone 4 for quite some time and it wasn't bad

207
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:18,320
but it's just so it iOS just feels like a different abstraction than a

208
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,840
traditional computer or a computer that I recognize and know how to use well

209
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,640
that's a great way to put it and so it's not bad and I can see how other people

210
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,840
might like it they've done a lot of very you're never gonna get access to the

211
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,280
file system you'll never understand the structure of it you don't have an

212
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,240
understanding of how applications can actually communicate with each other

213
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,120
yeah you have no visibility over the processes on the machine I'm also

214
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,800
someone you know who falls into weird little niches and I like to do weird

215
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,840
things like try to run tink on my phone or whatever and so it's just without

216
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,000
jailbreaking and then breaking a lot of the you know security that iOS has I

217
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,440
don't really have no way to do that boy that is a that is a great point

218
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,040
William did you specifically have I know you and I kind of talked about this

219
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,760
before do you have any thoughts on this particular topic I'm so frustrated by

220
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,120
the iPhone but it's so much better than my Android experience I think overall

221
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,760
that I stick with it what frustrated I'm frustrated that like a lot of

222
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,320
applications won't run in the background all the time and so you know like sync

223
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,440
clients and things which I have three of I have to open manually when I want them

224
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,320
to sync yeah yeah that is so frustrating and technically is infrastructure to get

225
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,640
that working but none of them have it working so I don't know what the deal is

226
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,120
yeah yeah they can't check to see if you're plugged in or on battery which I

227
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,640
think is frustrating like I know sync thing on Android is super nice because

228
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,280
you can set it so that it only activates when it's plugged in and it only

229
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,200
activates on Wi-Fi and then you know you're not gonna drain your battery by

230
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,720
connecting to sync thing but it was when you I were talking about this in

231
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,200
pre-production I was like well what do we have anything new to really add to

232
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,320
this conversation I mean you've got the pixel so you've made your choice there I

233
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,600
have the iPhone 7 specifically because of this reason this was the thing that

234
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:56,600
pushed me over that and application stability but your mom she's on an older

235
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,900
she's on an older phone yeah she's got the Nexus 5 not no longer getting the

236
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,600
new new updates does that as a geek does that bother you a little bit yeah you

237
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,800
feel like gosh maybe I should get mom a new phone for Christmas yeah you know it

238
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,680
makes me yeah it makes me think about that like should I have just told her to

239
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,120
buy you know buy the book at the iPhone even if it was expensive mm-hmm and I

240
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,360
wish I could give her more but you know there's just nothing I can do to help

241
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,240
her and she's not gonna buy a pixel that's just she doesn't need a phone

242
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,880
she doesn't use it to that capability she just needs a smartphone for the base

243
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,200
stuff you know wimpy is in there with the the Ubuntu touch you know that's

244
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,400
right so he's like a whole nother level when it comes to this because even when

245
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,120
you're on the iPhone you know you really you're putting your trust and faith in

246
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,280
Apple not to screw something up or not to work with somebody or etc etc so

247
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,280
I feel like wimpy he's like he's like the prepper you know like the crazy

248
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,000
prepper who's got like the bunker that's filled with all of the stuff for y2k

249
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,680
that's wimpy right now I don't want to be that might wake you up really what

250
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,880
are your thoughts on this it was security one of the things that moved

251
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,680
you towards the Ubuntu mobile platform or was it what what not not security so

252
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:10,280
much as just the data pooling and you know in light of oh yeah that's right

253
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,240
the Google aspect of which we're not we haven't even broadened the conversation

254
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,960
yeah point and not just not just the Google aspect but now I don't know if

255
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:25,600
this is being publicized in the US but the Investigatory Powers Bill has now

256
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,760
passed as law yeah you can I've done a little bit of following yeah replacing a

257
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,480
something that was declared unlawful by the courts last year and was due to

258
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,600
expire at the end of this year so fortunately for the government they must

259
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,920
be so pleased this new law has been passed and enacted that now makes the

260
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:54,320
previously unlawful thing lawful which is just terrific so yeah so you know

261
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,240
with those sorts of things and therefore you know companies like Google who

262
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,440
obviously got access to a lot of data they now become the government's best

263
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,480
friend when they're looking to mine information and it's not so much about

264
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,920
my own personal data because it's all in aggregate it's how the we were talking

265
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:20,160
about YouTube incorrectly content IDing stuff earlier I think you know a trend

266
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,000
that we will start to see is data mining for particular keywords and you know

267
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,040
photo image analysis that incorrectly indicates that people are subject to or

268
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,200
should be subject further deeper investigation in error is going to be

269
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,720
something you know maybe a nightmare scenario would be let's say you're using

270
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:54,040
Google Allo for your text messaging and you know you you have young kids and

271
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,800
sometimes you you you would pass photos back and forth as the kids those would

272
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:04,160
be those would be indexed but then also you know sometimes like you know I don't

273
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,040
know I'm this hypothetical but like maybe I'd put a joke in there about oh

274
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,160
I'm so sick of the kids let's put them on the street corner and see if we can

275
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,120
sell them for 50 bucks mm-hmm you know or some joke like that that is an in

276
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,640
joke between two people that know it's an absolute joke but now what happens if

277
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,920
the government gets access to that data and can index all of it and build a

278
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,200
personality profile about you or something creepy like that and the other

279
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,600
example I've used in the past is that being in a family where there are lots

280
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,440
of young children and as I've explained and any father will know young

281
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,640
children have a predisposition to take off all of their clothes and run around

282
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:48,480
but naked or or as near as when when photographs of taken of your children in

283
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,960
those situations and you happen to have cloud-sinking services turned on the

284
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,160
flesh tone analysis algorithms that can run over those photographs aren't

285
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,120
associating you as the parent of that child and the innocence of the situation

286
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:10,120
it's just a whether this is a suspicious image or not and and if that then gets

287
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,560
flagged up as you are now a person of interest you know that's not what you

288
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,840
want so that these are where my concerns it's not about my individual data it's

289
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,040
about how that can be I think even if you don't have a specific scenario even

290
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,560
if it's not about kids because that's sort of hard to connect for people that

291
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,560
aren't parents I think where my where my concern lies is if we're if we're

292
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,560
monitoring collecting and storing the date the data and records today what

293
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,240
information will they be able to generate and suss out you know years

294
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,560
down the road because once you have it stored what you can analyze and look at

295
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,880
that data it's endless right and as we know there are so many laws that it's

296
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,440
easy to violate even unintentionally or you know what that means true so I

297
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,080
William I heard you sign is there anybody else that wants to jump on

298
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:07,560
before we move on jump on jump on you know no okay oh well I got that took a

299
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,800
weird turn that took a weird turn I got weird you know we started I came in no

300
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,840
it's good it's good I just how have you been liking the pixel let me pick it up

301
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,640
you've been liking it oh you let me hold it again yeah sure so you're right now

302
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,640
two weeks into it yeah I still need to get a case and protect I'll probably

303
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,320
order that tonight yeah what I have what have you what have you thought so far

304
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,320
I'm liking it a lot it's a I haven't I haven't done much I haven't like

305
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,320
customized it very much or used it but obviously I'm enjoying USB C that's very

306
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,560
nice it does charge fast as advertised I am liking the camera there's some

307
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,000
differences I did like some things about my previous phone as well but I'm having

308
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,840
a good time with it and the battery life has been great so I feels like I'm on

309
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,680
like a modern platform I'm getting I'm you know I've got the updates from

310
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,080
Google yes I feels like it's a phone I can use and like not have to think

311
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,040
about I do agree with the author that if you're on the Nexus line if you're on

312
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:02,760
the pixel line you're in a much better position that is I do feel like I if you

313
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,360
set aside the other Google privacy aspects and you just go for the OS we

314
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,800
all know we all know this stuff needs patches constantly I mean if they're

315
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,440
running with Linux kernel in there you know you know there's not only them not

316
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,840
only is their own their own software have vulnerabilities in it but there's

317
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,620
just core fundamental vulnerabilities in the underlying kernel and so getting

318
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,840
those security updates for me was sort of like a baseline and I I'm not trying

319
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,160
to be fancy about it I'm not trying to say like oh you can I'm not trying to be

320
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,880
like some like Android master race user that says you can only buy pixel or

321
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,560
Nexus I'm saying really like if if you care at all about like the security of

322
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,520
your laptop or your servers or your desktop you should honestly really care

323
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,480
about the security of your phone and I think that's why I talk about this

324
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,920
because there is such a mindset out there and I don't mean to call anybody

325
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,320
out but you know I go to these meetups and I see people and they pull out their

326
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,240
old Android phones and I'm not trying to shame them but they're really old and

327
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,800
insecure and I understand absolutely when it's a when it's a budget thing but

328
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,480
you know even a 5x would be still getting updates and you can pick it up

329
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,760
for fairly cheap definitely so I don't know it's oh I really would like people

330
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,280
to to to think about this I would really like people to to walk around devices

331
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,760
that are getting updates just simply for not just them but for the rest of the

332
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,520
network yeah exactly it's a community thing well speaking of networks let's

333
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,360
let's stop right here and we've been talking about mobile let's talk about

334
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,320
our first sponsor that's this week this fit it all in let's bring it all

335
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,960
together that'd be ting go over to linux.ting.com to get $25 off your first

336
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,280
device or $25 in service credit ting is a great solution to this if you have a

337
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,160
Nexus or a pixel device they don't have like an agenda to get you to install

338
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,400
their version of a launcher or their skin there's nothing there's nothing

339
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,440
about that experience that ting uses to monetize the user that requires they

340
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,960
stay on the way of the updates it's it's totally opposite of their business model

341
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,200
ting does not get in the way of the updates from the upstream OEM if you

342
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,240
have a Nexus device you get the monthly updates if you have a Samsung device when

343
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,720
Samsung ships an update you get a day of on the ting network there's no there's

344
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,000
no incentive for ting to delay it and that's the business model you want now

345
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,400
that's that's sort of just a side ting is just great all around also because if

346
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,760
you only pay for what you use wireless it's six dollars for a line so if you

347
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,400
want a couple of phones if you have a Nexus 6p and you have an iPhone 7 like I

348
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,320
do because I'm working on both two lines six dollars a month

349
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,720
Rekai upstairs he's over he's working up he's working in the upstairs basement

350
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,920
right now editing this show as we go and I'll tell you what it would be extremely

351
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,160
expensive for Jupiter broadcasting to pay for a traditional phone line like a

352
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,840
giant family plan because he's he doesn't you know he talks to friends and

353
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,520
family over Skype isn't they all do Skype he's on Telegram all the time and

354
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:58,040
when he's here which is most of the time he's on Wi-Fi yeah and so why would I

355
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,520
pay for like even a hundred minutes he doesn't use it why would I do that it's

356
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,560
so great because I can give him total mobile freedom if he wants to go outside

357
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,360
the studio and go do stuff he's got data he's got cellular he's good to go from

358
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,560
a business perspective you can communicate with him as you need to

359
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,480
exactly otherwise when he's here I'm only paying for what he uses six dollars

360
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,920
for the line I think it's so great so go to Linux dot ting comm to support the

361
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,400
show and get a twenty five dollar discount they have a Black Friday sale

362
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,240
and I think maybe ting forgot to check their calendar I think some of these

363
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,240
devices are still on sale yeah like you can get the LG tribute 5 for 50 bucks

364
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,120
Wow and look at this you can also get the tin tell it I don't know it any tell

365
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,160
I don't even know what this is a wearable phone and GPS tracker for 150

366
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,680
bucks plus 50 and ting credit look at that it's like a that is so cool it's

367
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,920
like a little tracker runner thing that has a CDMA yeah and ting is great for

368
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,040
that things you just need a data connection for you know I know because

369
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,880
you can get just the GSM you only pay for when you use it look at this thing

370
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,360
has GPS you can track it on a map that's pretty cool pretty cool and it has a

371
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,960
phone too that's amazing for 150 bucks Wow I never even seen it that's that is

372
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,200
the greatest check them out linux.com mobile that makes sense shake up the

373
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,120
mobile industry and get your patches don't let your mobile carrier stand in

374
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:28,200
your way linux.com let's move into some more updates now we have things that are

375
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,880
a little more controversial you might have seen the headline core VLC

376
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,680
developer says no one cares about Linux and open HMD is a joke oh my gosh over

377
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:45,040
at VR on linux.com this is a spicy post an email exchange between Norbert and

378
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,960
one of the core developers of VLC and always in gadget do you remember the

379
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,840
details on this I can't remember the details it was very heated it was

380
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,800
very the video land dev said this is well let's get to the because this

381
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,880
actually doesn't really matter because this is the part that just caused

382
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,080
everybody get upset right the video land developer said that no one cares about

383
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:10,680
Linux and the VR has no shot on Linux mostly it's a driver issue and this got

384
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,960
a lot of attention today and it's kind of disappointing because when the story

385
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,480
was posted to r slash Linux JB stopped by and answered and said hey I'm I'm the

386
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,040
guy that was being interviewed in this email exchange here and I never said

387
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,000
that about Linux that's not what I said now it's not clear exactly what how that

388
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,600
happened right yeah but I want to get into the quotes I want to get into what

389
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:41,720
he says actually happened but before we do that this is all sort of gotten the

390
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:48,400
ball started got rolling here when VLC announced 360 degree view in the Windows

391
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,400
and Mac OS versions of VLC but not in the Linux version so the website VR and

392
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,760
Linux decided to reach out to the VLC project find out what what would the

393
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,640
deal was hey guys how come we don't have 360 degree video in VLC and as wimpy

394
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,600
will often advocate this is a core feature that we absolutely have to have

395
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:14,040
on the Linux desktop is 360 degree VR video and so I believe I believe no okay

396
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:22,080
so the VR on Linux site reached out and got kind of I don't know a snappish back

397
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,880
and forth there was a bit of a culture clash he goes into their IRC they start

398
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,040
making some typical jokes about Linux in their IRC that everybody kind of knows

399
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,200
are just jokes this journalist supposedly quote-unquote

400
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,280
journalist this person that runs the website supposedly takes these quotes

401
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,720
out of context and then creates the headline VLC developer says no one cares

402
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:45,360
about Linux that's the background so here is what that VLC developer actually

403
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,160
says he says the issue on VR is that there are a very large number of

404
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,600
headsets and that all of them require some different drivers and different

405
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,000
API's to work with them even on Windows it's not very stable and unfortunately

406
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,840
the people riding the drivers do not care about Linux hence the quote but the

407
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,200
very very very three varies large majority of developers of VLC are using

408
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,400
Linux because it's the only same system you can use to base your work on

409
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:22,200
therefore I have never ever ever said no one cares about Linux this is the most

410
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:30,120
stupid thing I have ever seen especially outside the VR context but yes so far

411
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,120
very few people care about Linux VR the drivers are very bad compared to Windows

412
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,280
and the gamers using VR are very few on Linux seems pretty fair yeah very few

413
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,960
anywhere aren't they mm-hmm right well maybe we'll see there's a Star Trek game

414
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:53,360
coming out that might get me to get a PlayStation if I could I would I had a

415
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,640
prediction on that other podcast you know the other one for this year which

416
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:03,720
was that VR would continue to lack adoption and I found some figures to

417
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,120
demonstrate what the market thought the VR adoption would be this year oh and

418
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:18,240
what the adoption has actually been and it is abysmally below target by millions

419
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,480
and millions and millions of units so I don't think calling out Linux for poor

420
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,560
VR support is an issue because there's very little VR support and what VR

421
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:35,960
support exists is beyond the means of most people anyway unless you have an S6

422
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,520
or S7 and that I say that because I was at a Thanksgiving event over the

423
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:46,440
holiday and one of our family friends was there with a Samsung s7 and the new

424
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,320
VR headset and it was here how much does an S how much does an S7 and the

425
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,340
matching headset cost you know the S7 out the same as a VR gaming PC and you

426
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:02,400
know what it's it's so bad it is so worse than even the oculus than the

427
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:10,040
5 it is it is it is it is baby VR it's baby VR with a diaper on it and with a

428
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,520
with a stinker in the diaper and it's going around telling everybody it's VR

429
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:19,200
and it I you know I watched everybody there try it on and that was their first

430
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,760
VR experience and I went home yeah you can look at a dinosaur yeah you can you

431
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,160
can look at the up to the Jeeps over there and you can look at a dinosaur

432
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,080
that's VR all right it is very disappointing it's very expensive the

433
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,240
hardware requirements are ridiculous the headsets are not standardized the all of

434
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,520
it is just it's a total it's a total doesn't give a good approximation of

435
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,120
what like the most exciting aspects of VR at least like the good ones are at

436
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,440
least looking from the outside and I got it I will I will admit I am NOT a VR

437
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,120
enthusiast I do not follow it super closely but at least looking from the

438
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:58,160
outside it does look like it is stacked for failure core companies haven't come

439
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,400
together like I would have expected them by now there's no standardizations like

440
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,400
I would have expected by now big companies that I would have thought

441
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,680
would be in it are not in it right now it's still kind of small there's not a

442
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,760
solution for the cable problem right now we haven't seen like 2017 you know

443
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,520
concept models of VR headsets that are totally wireless what we're seeing

444
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,720
instead are backpack PCs that have huge power cords coming off of them this is

445
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,080
this is not looking good so maybe Linux not being on the forefront of it isn't

446
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,400
the biggest deal yeah I guess I'd love to be wrong because I really felt like

447
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,800
my experience with the oculus was sort of revolutionary yeah I know a lot of

448
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,720
people who like the vibe a lot yeah I heard good things do you have any

449
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,280
thoughts on Debian putting everything in slash user screw it we're just gonna put

450
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,960
everything all of the things no that's not actually quite true but there is

451
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,240
evidence of a shift that can be found in the bootstrap option that has arrived in

452
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,000
the latest unstable branch where Debian developer has posted news in the mailing

453
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,480
list as well saying that if you use Deb bootstrapping with a certain command you

454
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,860
can now merge slash user with slash bin s bin and lib they'll be they'll put

455
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,160
symlinks in their former positions or something to that effect do I have that

456
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,760
right mm-hmm you know and there's consolidation like Arches done is that

457
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,760
what you're gonna say would be I was gonna say exactly the same thing isn't

458
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,480
this what fedora and arch have done several years ago yep yeah I think I

459
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,400
mean it's it's funny in the historical sense that now like everything is under

460
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,980
slash user you know given like it's like some of its original purposes and just

461
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,280
like it's we could just have those things under you know just under the

462
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,800
root directory perhaps but I think practically you know we have the file

463
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,760
system we have we have the you know legacy and dependencies on the file

464
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,600
system structure so this seems like a very practical thing to do I was looking

465
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,520
it looks like arch did this back in 2013 mm-hmm which means I've been using

466
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,280
that's when I switch I switch to arch right as the systems I just first set up

467
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,080
we're switching over and then the systems I set up slightly after already

468
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,960
had this transition said it so that's that's my milestone was this big switch

469
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,320
that arch did that's a long time anyways if you're curious the new option is sort

470
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,160
of it's sort of nice one of the reasons for the change that the current hierarchy

471
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,880
creates busywork for developers they have said like back in January developers

472
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,780
were talking about the change would mean that we don't have to try to harass a

473
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:19,240
thousand package maintainers into doing essentially on untestable busywork to

474
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,660
move things around between slash user slash business live to support a tiny

475
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:27,160
handful of systems for which other approaches are available and they also

476
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,480
say another good reason for doing this it greatly simplifies the creation of

477
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,640
read-only file systems which are useful for things like USB Linux distros and

478
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,520
secure environments transaction updates things like that

479
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,440
hey sounds like a good thing not a big deal really

480
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,480
Debbie and just sort of coming in line with changes but I guess this means that

481
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,600
Ubuntu will also be making this change that I guess is newsworthy too and I

482
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,880
don't really think it's gonna cuz with symlinks left in place it almost don't

483
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,480
imagine the majority of people will see this I was like I would like them to say

484
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,260
hey no symlinks nice and clean you know what that breaks though there's a there

485
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,440
are distros there are distros out there that have radically different file

486
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,840
systems mobile can any of you be my external brain what's the one I'm

487
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,400
thinking of that has a totally different file system hierarchy that makes a lot

488
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,720
more sense that they're the only distro bow Linux maybe I think that's it yeah

489
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,480
gobo was posted there nixos also does something yeah every package is stored

490
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,840
individually every single build hey you 1604 users would you like in a little

491
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:34,680
hwe huh huh you want a little hwe yes I do a little hardware enablement that's

492
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:41,320
right sick starting with Ubuntu 16.04.2 and beyond you're gonna get hardware

493
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,800
enabling hardware enablement kernels which are backported from newer Ubuntu

494
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,840
releases in order to allow new hardware to work on the older LTS release that's

495
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:56,400
not new that's not all of that interesting but what is new is they're

496
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,560
calling this new version a rolling hardware enablement kernel a rolling hwe

497
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:06,360
kernel essentially consumers of an hwe kernel will automatically be upgraded to

498
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,720
the next kernel offered in the subsequent point releases until reaching

499
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,720
the final kernel offered in 16.04.5 so it's not like true rolling it's just

500
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,040
that you automatically get your kernel upgraded to the next hardware enablement

501
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,880
kernel with future LTS point releases I think I'm getting that right I mean

502
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,840
perhaps a more yeah not quite rolling but at least more frequent I like that

503
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,680
though approximately I was talking with mr. Tonell there in the in the Mamba

504
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,680
room about neon and neon is based on 1604 and if I do decide to try out the

505
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,800
plasma desktop again I think I'm gonna do it on neon and I like the idea that

506
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,480
I'll get a modern neon desktop right LTS 1604 that gets hardware enabled

507
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,960
kernels which means newer laptops will be supported and whatnot so hopefully a

508
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,440
very stable system that's not gonna you know you get new things but it's not

509
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,280
gonna break on you yeah yeah that is that is particularly appealing to me you

510
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,920
know kinds oh yeah oh you are what do you think about this as somebody who's

511
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,200
kind of doing that very approach do you care about news like this is this seem

512
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,320
like this is gonna be kind of a compelling feature to what you're now

513
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,120
using as your standard desktop this is great for future proofing stuff I mean

514
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,840
even though it's not really a thing but it's more like my hardware is fine I

515
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,200
don't have a problem with it but the the fact that this they're using a 1604 and

516
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,720
their their goal for neon is to always be LTS so in a year or two oh well not

517
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,240
two but a year and a year and a half it'll be more of a problem that is it's

518
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,360
based on 1604 just like every district that's our ever been LTS based that you

519
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,000
know 1404 like elementary or mint or whatever they always had the same kind

520
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,760
of problems with hardware support and stuff like that so this kind of yeah

521
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,520
that was very nice provides a benefit to that too and also because the church of

522
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:00,160
neon maybe can I pick on you do you know does this mean like if I'm running an

523
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:05,560
1604 install will I have a newer version of the kernel will it be like version

524
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:11,280
4.8 or is it stuff that actually gets back ported to the 1604 kernel that

525
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,080
shipped every right so this this isn't so different from what's been done in

526
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,800
previous year or previous LTS is so the point to release is always the release

527
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:30,320
where the hardware enablement kernel first lands and traditionally that has

528
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:37,040
been named after the current interim release kernel that's out so at the

529
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:44,240
moment that's Yakety that's from 1610 so the 1610 kernel will get back ported

530
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,040
into 1604 and traditionally it's not just the kernel it's also the graphics

531
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,000
stack comes along with it as well oh right I remember that yeah that is kind

532
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,520
of a big deal too but the names of the packages were always named after the

533
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,480
interim release so they were something something hyphen Yakety and I think

534
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,880
what's happening this time round is that that naming convention will be dropped

535
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,880
so that once you opt in to the hardware enablement kernel which you have to

536
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,120
manually do it via updates if you're running 1604 dot one or earlier or will

537
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:27,840
be embedded by default in the 1604 dot two ISOs once you've opted into that

538
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:34,400
you will get the subsequent releases for zesty and whatever a and B might be

539
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,840
automatically through updates once you've opted into the hardware

540
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:45,880
enablement kernel that's pretty neat you and do you know if this is changed all

541
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,800
if I've also opted into the live patching service or can I have my cake

542
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:57,280
and eat it too you know I don't know the details on that I will imagine that the

543
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,760
live patch will work but I tell you what why don't we discuss that next week and

544
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,720
I'll get an answer from an authoritative source I guess I'm sort of fantasizing

545
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,200
about like a 1604 machine with a current desktop environment a hardware

546
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,200
enablement kernel that continues to give back ports and live patches that's

547
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,240
sounding like a great workstation it really does yeah exactly I was about to

548
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,780
say perfect work so this the only thing that's changed here though is that in

549
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:27,140
the past you would choose to opt into a particular right kernel release it

550
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,640
sounds more like how I'd want to be stacked whereas this time it will now

551
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,200
move with each of the interim releases automatically which seems ideal really

552
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,160
yeah and and sort of playing into this sort of making that the ideal

553
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,280
workstation is I saw a really popular story today on Twitter was actually from

554
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,080
OMG Ubuntu about I think it was five applications I already snapped up that

555
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,080
you can install right now and of course one of them was telegram which is of

556
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,000
course they're gonna get you up the top of my list and I it seems to be there's

557
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,640
some serious movement happening around snaps so I kind of wanted to pick

558
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,000
wimpy's brain if we go a little bit further and and talk about this story I

559
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,360
saw on softpedia this is now you can package your apps as snaps without

560
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:13,040
bundling their dependencies which I would think would make these snaps

561
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,760
significantly smaller but I but at the same time that feels like it's sort of

562
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,280
defeating the entire purpose I thought the whole point was that I download this

563
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,480
one thing and everything runs what's going on with me well this is utilizing

564
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:36,000
the content sharing interface which was tabled at the snappy sprint in the

565
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,560
summer which was the sprint that all the community people were invited to so the

566
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,000
likes of the elementary project and the KDE team via blue systems and myself

567
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,600
then as well so this is when we first heard about this content sharing

568
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:56,800
interface and the idea here is that if you have got a common platform that lots

569
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:04,280
of applications target then that platform can be snapped and it can share

570
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,360
its assets so that applications can connect to them so for example in this

571
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,360
in this case the the article in question is talking about the Ubuntu app

572
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:21,080
platform which is essentially Qt based applications so those that you will find

573
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:29,280
in Unity 8 for example so here you now have a platform snap for Qt and you can

574
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:38,640
now elect to connect to those assets in that common platform for your Qt based

575
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,200
snap so does that mean the client is aware when I install something that says

576
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,200
hey I've already got all of the Qt dependencies and since that's that's

577
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,600
something that's so specifically these are not dependencies this is a word you

578
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,480
absolutely have to avoid this is this is a either a bunch of libraries or a bunch

579
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,240
of assets but it essentially a collection of files that another snap

580
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,900
can connect to and behind the scenes they're effectively being bind mounted

581
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:14,580
into your application at runtime oh okay so so if another application I've

582
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:20,880
installed has those libraries the new application I install will mount that

583
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,880
image connect to the and use the libraries in that image yeah yeah

584
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,360
exactly so so how does that affect like updates like if I update one snap but

585
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,560
the other snap doesn't get updated but it's dependent I'm not depending but

586
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,160
linking in order to control that there's a mechanism called assertions that make

587
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,680
sure that you can ensure that this particular platform snap can is

588
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,600
compatible with this particular application snap and and and the those

589
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,880
those connections won't be broken in any way how does that avoid be feeling like

590
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,560
dependencies though because it doesn't that sound like okay would that then

591
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:03,120
prevent one snap from getting updated if another snap is using its libraries not

592
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,200
necessarily because the platform snaps can be versioned independently so in the

593
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:15,040
GTK parlance you could have a GTK 318 platform snap and a GTK 320 platform

594
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:22,600
snap and a GTK 322 snap okay and within the application that you're creating so

595
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:29,640
let's choose get it you can define in the get it snap which which version of

596
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,480
the platform snap it requires I see okay it seems like it's like a handy option

597
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,300
where like you then you know if you don't want to depend on one of those you

598
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,720
still have all this capability and roll your bring your dependencies with you

599
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,200
exactly and and you know there are some big wins here so the sizes of the

600
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,520
individual application snaps come down considerably sure yeah the example of

601
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,280
these cute applications they were looking at individual applications using about

602
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:03,020
86 Meg and coming down to about 1.3 Meg by using content sharing and also the

603
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,520
build time reduces as well it doesn't have to pull in all of that stuff so the

604
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,840
build time plummets considerably from you know close to 1 minute 50 down to a

605
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:17,600
few seconds so those those are all those are all good wins for sure and it's not

606
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:23,440
just it's not just the Ubuntu platform snap that's available in this fashion

607
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:30,260
the KDE team have been working towards snapping KDE 5 and the plasma

608
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:35,640
frameworks and they've been using this technique for some weeks now and have

609
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,000
demonstrated significant gain so I think their platform snap is like a hundred

610
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,920
and sixty or a hundred and eighty megabytes and if you repeat that many

611
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,560
times over for each of the individual applications that obviously you know

612
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,360
doesn't scale very well but they they create this platform snap and then the

613
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,960
individual application snaps are you know measured in one or two megabytes

614
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:06,120
or smaller so you know it works 300k 300k yeah and there was a great

615
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:12,600
introduction to this given by Harold sitter who works for blue systems on KDE

616
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:18,320
at the Ubuntu online summit a couple of weeks ago so if you go to summit.ubuntu.com

617
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:23,500
and look up the the KDE presentation which I think was on the

618
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:29,320
Wednesday he gives a good introduction to how and also actually shows the code

619
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:33,760
behind so shows the snapcraft.yaml behind the scenes in terms of the

620
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,060
platform snaps and the individual application snaps and demonstrates how

621
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,720
they're connected and how they work so he did a great job of actually sort of

622
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,520
showing this you know in real terms and how it's benefiting the KDE team he's

623
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,200
also involved in developing neon so in him most of the guys in blue systems are

624
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,280
yeah you're making me you're making me you know you're making me want to use

625
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:05,960
neon I gotta say rotten dang it you'll find out on a future show maybe so yeah

626
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,140
well how hey rotten what do you do to mount Samba shares what do you do how

627
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:14,200
does that ever something you do oh yeah just auto mount what do you mean well

628
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,620
okay so you're doing it like when you boot up or you're doing it so like what

629
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:22,600
I was one of the things I love about one of the things I love about Nautilus is I

630
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:27,560
can show up at a network I joined I joined the wireless network I hit browse

631
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:32,960
for other locations all of the different Samba shares and AFP shares and SSH

632
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,160
servers show up I can double click an SSH a server I can double click a Samba

633
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,120
server I can double click an AFP server and it mounts using the gnome virtual

634
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:49,760
file system as an actual folder on my file system which we're gonna get to in

635
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,280
a little bit why that's a big deal and for me the fact that dolphin can connect

636
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,640
but when you double click a file it has to download the file to your local hard

637
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,600
drive and then open up the associated application like that doesn't work when

638
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:09,440
you're looking at a 20 gigabyte MKV file right it's rough that is rough yeah and

639
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,480
that explore ability especially if you're you know you're roving around

640
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,400
you're taking your laptop to different networks so you use a like you use like

641
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,000
you just you just mountain to the file system rotten that's what you know I'm

642
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,640
mounted as a network share I'm tempted I'm gonna do it I think you've talked me

643
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,520
into it I'm going to I'm going to install the plasma meta package I will

644
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:35,600
point out one thing what while neon and arch are both currently up-to-date neon

645
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:40,200
gets the newest release the same day arch is like a couple weeks at the most

646
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,760
it's like a week we can be two weeks maybe but neon is day of within hours

647
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,760
that would be nice and I think here's what I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm gonna

648
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,980
install it right now while we're doing the show we'll see how what happens at

649
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,760
the end of the show I'll log out and see if I can use if we have a show still

650
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,160
yeah but here's my thinking if I like it then maybe I would go neon but I might

651
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:04,200
as well dip my toes here I love I love the arch package management tools I love

652
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,320
just getting in there and installing things from the AUR like an animal all

653
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:12,400
of that so I'm gonna do it right now I'm gonna do it like a like a like a just an

654
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:20,320
animal do it do it live on the show I'm gonna put in my s right here hmm 426

655
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:26,280
packages it's only gonna download isn't that interesting 154 I like it yeah I'm

656
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,800
really excited to see how this goes so as of recording it looks like I'm seeing

657
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,880
a lot of plasma 5.8.4.1 packages 5.8.4 seems to be the first time installing

658
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:45,000
as we record so I'm gonna say yes to this and we are off to the races it is

659
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,040
West it is super satisfying you know that reminds me of that same satisfying

660
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,920
feeling when I install packages over a digital ocean for serious digital ocean

661
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,920
if you want to have a great package experience install them on a digital

662
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,720
ocean droplet what's a droplet a droplet is an all SSD powered Linux rig

663
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,600
or free BSD over at digital ocean comm in fact if you use our promo code of

664
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,320
power did you hear that it's on paper you know what that means it's official

665
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:14,840
because a tree died fitness right here you hear that you can't make those sound

666
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,960
effects up you can't put that in the sound board nope you can't find that on

667
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,080
freesound.org can't do that it's right in house special effects do unplugged

668
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,920
all one word lowercase you create an account you put that in there you apply

669
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,160
it you get $10 you can go spin up a Linux rig and guess what Wes they're not

670
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:36,600
sitting around over digital ocean they're now offering fedora 25 over a

671
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:41,000
digital ocean comm so you can spin up a four door 25 server of course they've

672
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,400
got the Ubuntu's they've got the Debbie ins I got the core OS sent OS and free

673
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,600
BSD and they have data centers in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam

674
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:53,160
London Toronto Germany the pricing is great five dollars a month for a basic

675
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:58,200
rig but you can also do hourly I've been getting a rig now that's like it's like

676
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,120
three cents an hour it's great so reasonable it's so nice and the

677
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:07,120
interface is perfect I could perfect balance of powerful but easy to use and

678
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:12,360
their documentation is top-notch they just published on the 1st of November a

679
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,840
guide on configuring next cloud on Ubuntu 1604 so if you've been thinking

680
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,880
about setting up next cloud want to roll your own cloud you want to have some of

681
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,560
the services and what's really nice too is you can set this up on Android and

682
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,040
iOS to sync with the next cloud instance and it's your own and you manage it at

683
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,960
digital ocean comm use our promo code you can get it for two months for free

684
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,320
just got to use that promo code do unplugged one word and apply it to your

685
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,000
account over digital ocean comm and you can dig around in their tutorials and

686
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,560
there's all kinds of handy information in there and now you can deploy fedora

687
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:49,840
25 fresh look at that that's pretty cool and you know it's nice how much they

688
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,360
keep up with you know various Linux communities it shows could very much

689
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,400
what's also super nice about it is they're working upstream they're working

690
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,520
with the projects it's not like they're just going off and taking the ISOs and

691
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,280
like they're communicating with the projects they're setting up channels for

692
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,160
updates and patches so everything's handled super smoothly great

693
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,280
relationships yeah digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplugged and a

694
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:17,680
big thank you digital ocean for sponsoring the um so I think this is a

695
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,120
good sign now there's some concerns I have with this but I think this is a

696
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:27,480
good sign the XPS 13 the Sputnik that's been been sort of like a trial balloon

697
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,760
by Dell right is getting another update sort of right right on the nose I

698
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,000
believe it's right on the anniversary of the Sputnik launch too which is kind of

699
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,480
funny the 59th anniversary there's a new version of Dell's and they call it like

700
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:45,080
a developer laptop right yeah it's not I don't really even know if there it's I

701
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,120
don't even know if project Sputnik is the right term anymore but that's what

702
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,600
everybody knows it by so they have a new XPS 13 developer edition that's what

703
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,280
they call it developer edition laptop it's got seventh generation Intel core

704
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:02,060
processors it ships with Ubuntu 1604 preloaded the killer wireless card which

705
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:07,640
are the rebranding of Qualcomm a Theros and infinity edge display either 1080p

706
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:13,240
or in their 4k version so it's a slight bump from what we're familiar with and

707
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,760
it starts at nine hundred and fifty bucks under a grand yeah that's nice

708
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:23,040
for an i5 8 gigs and of RAM and 120 gigabyte 128 gigabyte flash goes all

709
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:29,200
the way up to an i7 apparently they say with 16 gigs of RAM and 512 gig SSD

710
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,520
however when I tried to configure one out of out of just curiosity I couldn't

711
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,920
get it above 8 gigs so I don't know if maybe it was just Dell's horrible

712
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:45,120
horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible bad website or if you really

713
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,980
can't get it in more than 8 gigs but it does seem to be encouraging that Dell is

714
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,280
continuing to update it now the commenters on Hacker News say it's not

715
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:59,480
all roses the battery lasts for 13 hours under Linux which I guess is less than

716
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,840
expected seems alright he said that I'm like good

717
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:09,040
god man that sounds great the headphone port is very noisy with Linux and not

718
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:13,120
noisy with Windows I have I have personally experienced that a lot with

719
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:18,880
different machines Wi-Fi Wi-Fi that's the that's Wi-Fi the Wi-Fi performance

720
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,680
is I guess horrible under Linux and supposedly fine under Windows just in

721
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,960
you know I don't know that I that feel this I don't know the HDMI port I guess

722
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,520
does not work under Linux correctly so there could be a couple of things that

723
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,040
maybe are not perfect yet maybe if you ran arch you wouldn't have that that's a

724
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,720
good question as well there's not a lot of details there but I think this is a

725
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,880
good sign I think this is a good sign from Dell that they're continuing to

726
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,640
build this thing and I look at a lot of the options out there and I still think

727
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:52,600
the XPS is a very competitive offering I love mine I love mine and my drive

728
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:56,480
just died last week I was I was reviewing fedora 25 that my hard drive

729
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,320
died so that's like the Mac right you can't service it at all no I can pop the

730
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,880
bottom off and I can replace it it's just kind of a bummer that I've got

731
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:08,680
terrible I have lost yet another you burn through those things Brandon you

732
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:15,120
just ordered next ps13 yeah I did well congratulations the mr. new owner do you

733
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,980
have it yet no not yet oh well I would love placing my

734
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:28,160
MacBook Pro oh dang what was running on the MacBook Pro Mac OS this is a big

735
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,200
this is Brandon this seems like a big deal to me am I am I right this seems

736
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:40,480
like a big deal well I switched to Mac OS and from Linux in 2008 so yeah this

737
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,240
is a big deal for me well I'm gonna be really curious to hear how it goes will

738
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,080
you come back and let us know and give us an update on on the transition yeah

739
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:53,320
interesting okay so wimpy you have the 15 and the 13

740
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:57,800
XPS models what are your thoughts about this continued revisioning even though

741
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:02,860
it's not a very exciting one from Dell well it's good because you know the new

742
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:07,240
new line of processors have just come out and they've immediately revved those

743
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,860
two models with the latest stuff so that's really good to see because they

744
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:17,320
are I mean I don't know this but it outwardly it looks like Dell are trying

745
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,480
to compete with Mac in terms of developer mindshare and high-end

746
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,360
machines for developers yeah high-resolution screen seventh

747
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:31,800
generation Intel processors yeah and on the XPS 15 dedicated graphics as well

748
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:37,320
and yeah you know HDMI ports and multiple USB ports is that 15 is that a

749
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:42,240
Linux pre-loaded machine or is that something you put Linux on I put Linux

750
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:50,840
on the 15 the XPS 13 came pre-loaded yeah yep my my lady friend just loves

751
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:56,200
the XPS 13 she for her it's gorgeous it is that that that edge-to-edge display

752
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,840
beautiful it's sitting in the lab she's doing NaNoWriMo it's got a decent

753
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,980
keyboard on it she can do a lot of typing for her it's like a great machine

754
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,760
so it was a real bummer when the hard drive died makes me it makes me want to

755
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:12,360
just I mean I I I've now lost a hard drive in my Apollo I've lost the hard

756
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:15,320
drive in the Librem and now I've lost the drive in the explicit what what the

757
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:19,640
only thing I do that's the only thing I actually whether when I when I replace

758
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,820
them I replace them with Samsung's off of Newegg so that's kind of a common

759
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:28,000
theme but they're all you know whatever the OEM ships them with the only thing

760
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
I do a lot is I reload distros on them constantly that's the only thing I'm

761
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,120
doing that's unusual I don't I don't notice that I mean I'm I'm loading

762
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:42,720
distros on my machines like every day I wouldn't think it would cause any action

763
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:47,760
no no the right endurance on modern SSDs now is is pretty significant you're not

764
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,040
gonna be those concerns about or am I gonna you know burn through the right

765
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:56,560
cycles on the SSD is pretty much a thing of the past now I should get a hold of

766
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:00,000
Dell and tell them to send me one of these new ones for testing yeah because

767
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,760
I've got my mind's like two years mine's like two models behind it's like three

768
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,680
years old two miles behind but it looks the same as the current model right it

769
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:11,320
does it's gorgeous that screen is gorgeous that by the build is perfect I

770
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,560
really like the overall feel of it in the hand it's a great little machine

771
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,480
laptop to be proud of it's just a little underpowered and so I don't use it for

772
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,760
anything serious other than when we're watching TV and we want to browse the

773
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,680
web together that's what and it's got a touchscreen so when you're sharing when

774
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,240
you're sharing a computer you know she can she can touch the link and move the

775
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,480
screen and I can move it so it's it's a really nice like shared experience

776
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,840
computer yeah and it sits right there and the battery lasts forever that's all

777
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:42,680
really nice but because it's a it's a two core slow yeah I don't use it for

778
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,280
you don't use it for any production work yeah I see not anymore but I do use it

779
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,000
for testing high DPI and it's great for that that's green yeah I love testing I

780
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,680
love testing high DPI next it looks good and so recently I've been testing high

781
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:02,720
DPI on the MacBook retina 2013 and the which is a 15 inch screen and on the XPS

782
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,880
13 which is a 13 inch screen and it's you really I didn't realize this and it

783
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,960
seems obvious I mean it's gonna sound stupid when I say this out loud but I

784
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,800
didn't realize that high DPI made such a difference on different sized screens I

785
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:19,440
know that sounds so stupid to say out loud but I just thought like high DPI

786
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,000
was high DPI but there is a significant difference to look at a desktop

787
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,920
environment on a 15 inch high DPI screen versus a 13 inch high DPI screen

788
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,360
yeah well you can see that like right you know your phone may have a very high

789
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,640
DPI screen but to see that on the 15 inch screen yeah something else yeah it

790
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,960
was it seems stupid to say it out loud but when I actually started testing this

791
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,240
is this is something to happen a while ago when I started testing the different

792
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,200
distros on different screens and just getting blown away by how gorgeous some

793
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,920
of these things can look so yeah so let's talk about something that sort of

794
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,680
blows my mind away and that's net data so net data is getting support for

795
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:55,120
backend so let's back up what is net data and why do I want a backend on it

796
01:00:55,120 --> 01:01:00,840
net data is a very handy utility written by the same person who has written the

797
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,400
firehole IP tables manager that we've covered a little bit before yeah I use

798
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,600
personally and to great effect and so you know in his operational life

799
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:12,440
managing service etc he really wanted a something that he could just look at to

800
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,080
give him the real-time performance information quickly assess you know

801
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,240
what's the state of the server you know not like a huge history but look you

802
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,160
know see like absolutely what is it doing right now yeah snapshots type

803
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,400
type stuff what's going on yeah so so net data implements that it's a you know

804
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,920
just a tiny little binary that you run they've done I think pretty good work

805
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,600
continually making it so the overhead on the host is less and less you know I

806
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:36,480
think we've talked about it a little bit on last before too it's a really neat

807
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,280
tool yeah and it's nice because you just you just throw it right on the server

808
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:45,120
yeah and then and then it pops up a nice web interface that you go to it all you

809
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,360
know it uses the dynamically updates you kind of have live real-time information

810
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:52,720
right there in the browser graphs and all of that yeah yep yep and so like in a

811
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,680
larger picture it's it's useful it's especially useful if you have a couple

812
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,880
machines I use it on a lot of my machines you know just start the service

813
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,240
and go but it becomes harder when you really want to you know do you want to

814
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,720
have historical information or you want to aggregate this information and so you

815
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,120
can look across your entire fleet and they have added some support so that

816
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,240
like one net data interface can look at other net datas which is really nice

817
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,560
that's huge ah so this is we start recording on a back end this is where

818
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,240
you started working on like multiple machines and historical stuff yeah so

819
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,240
like so that works it's kind of new but a lot of places will already have had

820
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,740
some sort of time series database a popular one is graphite which was open

821
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:33,400
sourced by orbits right and so you know and and so now net data can interface

822
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:38,280
with that they support both graphite and open tstb which are two big players in

823
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:42,240
that space and both have protocols that other players support and so this just

824
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,760
means that like you know either you can use net data as part of your solution if

825
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,760
you already have this infrastructure or it just makes it really easy to connect

826
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,460
and then you have the the real-time information of net data and the

827
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:54,280
historical trending and other stuff that works with like graphite which has a

828
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:58,440
huge community of tools and other stuff to work on hmm so how are you using this

829
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,880
because I know you started that you're starting to poke at this right yeah I

830
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,600
have poked at it you know right now I'm just using it for a personal use and

831
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:10,280
that's mostly because it didn't have this you know back end stuff and so for

832
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:14,480
working on the things we already have graphite infrastructure so this we need

833
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,600
something that would play along and in the graphite world you have collectors

834
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:22,200
that kind of sit on the host in every X intervals collect information send it to

835
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,520
graphite and then it stores it and gives you graphs right so net data does the

836
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,440
same thing but before it was kind of its own system often its own which worked

837
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,360
really well for small deployments really well for you just want to drop something

838
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,320
you don't want a lot of configuration you just want boom you have graphs it

839
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,240
can do some like minimal alerting stuff like hey send me an email when my disk

840
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:44,160
is over 90% or whatever so I think now like I'm I may not actually use it at

841
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:48,040
work but I think that for a lot of maybe smaller companies middle-sized things

842
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:53,120
people who are building a new monitoring stack it seems like a great tool no

843
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,920
kidding no kidding man if you were building something today this would be

844
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,880
such a great way to go and if you look at the the github there's like a pretty

845
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,960
good amount of activity people are adding plugins so that you can have it

846
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:10,160
monitor other things besides just that's cool that's very nice and Wes has some

847
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:14,440
additional information and links in the show notes you know we should mention

848
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,880
this if anything we just said went over your head at all if you're not sure

849
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,880
about anything or if you're just sort of lost maybe things feel a little weird

850
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,840
right now you got a little upset about that you got a little clamp like I did

851
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:32,640
Linux Academy Linux Academy comm slash unplug go there to support the show and

852
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:36,600
send it for a free seven-day free trial this we can learn all of the basics but

853
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,040
also all the really cool stuff coming down the pipe the stuff that people are

854
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,960
making money on basing their careers on getting jobs getting contracts and now

855
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,960
with Linux Academy's public profiles you can brag about what you've done but

856
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,920
really can also show your employer or your client what you've achieved Linux

857
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:54,560
Academy is a platform to learn more about Linux if you're an expert or a

858
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:59,760
total noob they got stuff for you video courses self-paced in-depth video courses

859
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,960
on every freaking Linux cloud and DevOps topic labs that give you hands-on real

860
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:08,960
experience instructor mentoring when you need that human help learning paths which

861
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,240
are series of courses and content planned by instructors for specific

862
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,760
types of tracks you might be going down or if you're just going for the certs

863
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,400
they got courses specifically to prepare you for exams they got a great

864
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,040
community I can say that cuz it's full of Jupiter broadcasting members and they

865
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:24,280
got note cards that are forked by that community that help you prep and learn

866
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,600
and they have nuggets when you have just a little bit of time available you can

867
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:31,240
just do a deep dive into a single topic and they have a core scheduler to also

868
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:35,400
work with your busy schedule servers that spin up on-demand you need them matching

869
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,920
the distribution you've chosen Linux Academy Linux Academy comm slash

870
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,920
unplugged go there and check them out and a big thank you Linux Academy for

871
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:51,220
sponsoring the unplugged program kind of speaking of the basics there Wes there

872
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:55,440
was a great article over at open source comm by David both I think it is and

873
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:01,960
David wrote managing devices in Linux using the slash dev directory and how

874
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:06,600
the slash dev directory gives you access to your devices this month I cover some

875
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:11,240
fascinating aspects of the slash dev directory now I kind of say in a mocking

876
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:17,960
tone but this is a super useful tool when you switch from Windows and come

877
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:24,520
over to Linux or Unix devices as items on your file system is a mind-blowingly

878
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:30,920
awesome concept paradigm shift it is a total total paradigm shift so I want to

879
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:35,080
put this officially in the show notes for episode 173 for all of your friends

880
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,040
that you have switching over to Linux that are a little bit savvy with Windows

881
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,880
or the Mac and they don't understand how this works give them this article this

882
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,560
is a great article and I feel like most of time you like you know you interface

883
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:48,680
you like with slash dev slash SDA what a you know SDA one that kind of stuff

884
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,960
right but that's as far as most people go you don't get into the details these

885
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,920
days you dev like auto populate slash dev anyway so yeah you don't you know

886
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,520
most people don't have to deal with this or make you know use make node or

887
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:03,920
anything like that so I found it helpful I think a lot of new users will find it

888
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,680
helpful too yeah and it's it's well structured with visual guides and all of

889
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,880
that too so you can find that over there we'll have it linked in the show notes

890
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:16,400
but it was at open source comm and it's managing device limit under Linux but I

891
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:22,800
just I remember I remember when I wrap my head around that how awesome I

892
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,960
thought that idea was and how cool it was the way the kernel does that and all

893
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,040
of that was it's such exemplified the difference where like Windows you know

894
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:33,200
you would anything you'd learned you felt like you would just kind of scrape

895
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,880
together hack-and-claw to just try to pry this information from this black box

896
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,680
and there's Linux is just like but you're like boom here's everything that I

897
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:46,200
know about so I got a lot of crap this I mean it's only Tuesday and I have I

898
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:51,040
have I have taken a beating on this particular topic already so yesterday

899
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:56,920
no two days ago we reviewed Fedora 25 on the Linux action show and in Fedora 25 I

900
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:02,280
talked about my upgrade from Fedora 24 different toward 25 and I just want to

901
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:07,040
play a little bit of that moment from the show right don't wait for it right

902
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,960
here just jumped ahead let's see what it says

903
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:17,240
error running transaction on libmpeg123.so from install the mpeg123 conflicting

904
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:23,800
files oh we have file mpeg123 libs conflicts with libmpeg123 wait does that

905
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:30,280
mean my entire installation is done uninstall and move on so am I stuck on

906
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:34,440
Fedora 24 now the struggle is real and I'm pushing on using the terminal I'm

907
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:40,480
gonna do a DNF system upgrade I'm doing dash dash release version 25 and then

908
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:47,360
tack tack allow erasing that should do what I'm hoping is uninstall stuff

909
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:51,120
that's blocking and just move on let's so I want to take a minute and talk

910
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,880
about upgrade versus nuke and pave and so one of the big pieces of feedback I

911
01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:00,440
got is Chris you damn moron why the hell are you using United RPMs garbage that's

912
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:03,720
trash you should be using RPM fusion apparently the Fedora community feels

913
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,480
extremely strong about this so I just wanted to make it clear that the reason

914
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:14,180
why I was using United RPMs is because we had covered United RPMs as an

915
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:19,040
announcement in the show and they promised that I would use it to follow

916
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:23,520
up on how it went so that's why I was using United RPMs so I got a lot of crap

917
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,160
for that you're espousing or trying to tell the audience what to use but really

918
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:30,240
the whole concept of well that's a third-party repo they got all crazy

919
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:33,880
kinds of applications you don't know what their standards are how could you

920
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:37,520
possibly expect your core distro to upgrade successfully that's that's the

921
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:43,360
core sort of sentiment that I was receiving I don't know really know where

922
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:47,480
to come down on this I used to be a nuke and paver like nobody's business yep all

923
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:51,200
the time sick every six months a nuke and pave nuke and pave runs better cleaner

924
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:56,840
etc etc get to I like resetting things up I enjoyed the process now in the last

925
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:01,720
year or so I've transitioned to I never want to reinstall kind of guy and I the

926
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:05,040
last thing I want to do is set up a new computer I just like it working out of

927
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:09,480
the box where do you fall now with a nuke and pave thing and do you think

928
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:13,220
that I maybe I is this something that distribution should work on this upgrade

929
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:17,280
path or is this something that users should let go of and just nuke and pay

930
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:22,280
you know it it strikes me that it people seem to fall into and very strongly into

931
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:27,120
both camps and I think it depends a lot on how you view your distribution what

932
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:31,000
you get out of it so if it is just a tool you know if it is more you view it

933
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,880
more like a Windows style operating system where you've installed that you

934
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:36,920
just expect it to work you're not necessarily tweaking it a lot or you

935
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,400
have made those tweaks but you really don't want to do it again you didn't

936
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,200
spend if you didn't spend the time necessarily documenting as you set up

937
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:46,280
you just you know installing Linux these days is supposed to be easy you it is

938
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,800
easy you install it it just works so in that regard I think it you know

939
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,520
especially when you feel like that or it's an appliance that you just want to

940
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,640
be able to upgrade it right like you expect you it performs very well it's

941
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,240
very stable you expect that same stability in the upgrade process

942
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:04,880
personally I do like the nuke and pave model I don't have to do that much arch

943
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,240
is nice in that you know I only really do it when I change machines or if I'm

944
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:14,140
doing upgrades or other things but I do think the nuke and pave model helps you

945
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:17,240
track your personal dependencies helps you understand what things you do need

946
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,880
what makes a complete system for you that may not be a journey that every

947
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,400
person wants or needs to go on you know and if you're not changing machines very

948
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,360
often you're not changing setups or you're you're comfortable with you know

949
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,480
it depends you like some people if you're not installing a bunch of weird

950
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:33,020
packages if you're not making dramatic reconfigurations to your system then you

951
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:35,920
may not need to nuke and pave or you may not feel the that you want to nuke and

952
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,520
pave right but yeah sometimes like right now you know I'm downloading in the

953
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,360
background and I'm upgrading to the plasma desktop I'm like yeah maybe this

954
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,680
would be better as a nuke and pave this might be better as a nuke and pave but and if I

955
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,480
if I decide I want to switch to the plasma desktop for a little extended

956
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,280
period of time I probably would nuke and pave and something that I I think the

957
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,400
nuke and pave does help or can help maybe can help is that it can teach you

958
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,180
know like make sure that your data is not local to your system yeah you know

959
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:02,440
that was that was why I was such a big fan of it even like a year ago I was

960
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:06,360
like I'm a nuke and pave every time because if because to me there was a

961
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:11,360
period of time for a long time West like it for you for years where like I could

962
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:15,600
format a computer on a time like if somebody like I got no problem like I

963
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,440
know I knew I knew persistently everything was synced it was all backed

964
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:23,760
up no problem I'll pave it right now and even you know and maybe you use

965
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:28,080
something like ansible or something else or you have like well I didn't have a

966
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,760
bash script that installs all your favorite packages you can that means

967
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,880
that you can go from nothing to yeah you're running just like you were in

968
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:37,240
minutes yeah yeah exactly but that's not for everyone and not everyone needs that

969
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,720
yeah go ahead on our GPU if you nuke and pave when you use the plasma thing if

970
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:45,640
you install the plasma desktop you could nuke and pave and install the

971
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:50,920
intergos build setup for plasma whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

972
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,480
whoa how come you didn't tell me that what a few minutes ago when I was

973
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,640
installing the plasma desktop what now what can I do what can I do you can

974
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,680
install the intergos build setup for plasma where you get all the all the

975
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,600
modifications well what do I do what how do I do that

976
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,360
intergos dash KDE dash setup are you serious okay I'm gonna try this right

977
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:15,160
now because I have all my packages so I do a kid integrals what okay give me the

978
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:18,440
give me this give me that give me give me the knowledge here rod is a kid

979
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:22,720
integrals dash KD dash setup yeah all one package name all right I'm doing it

980
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:28,600
right now let's do it live on the air let's do it let's do it so we'll do okay

981
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:34,080
yeah like your color terminal thank you look at all this stuff so what is all of

982
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,280
this rotten what is all I'm sorry mr. to know what is all this and it's all the

983
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:45,200
modifications for all the stuff that you do k3b if you install the key if you

984
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:50,160
choose KDE and the install for the in century it gives you this this looks

985
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,360
like a bunch of stuff I would have wanted installed this looks like stuff

986
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:58,920
why I installed plasma dash meta right like for example how is KDE base dash

987
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:04,120
lib not installed how is Kate that how is Kate not installed like what the hell

988
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,800
did I install plasma dash plasma dash metaphor if this crap isn't installed

989
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:12,160
will you ask for the dependencies of everything that's plasma console not

990
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:16,360
everything that's KDE console was not installed by the plasma dash meta

991
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:22,840
package console right yeah that's unbelievable it's it's understandable

992
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,600
because that's what it's for it's a DE you want the entire KD stack that's a

993
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:30,880
totally different thing so what should I if I wanted to use console and Kate what

994
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,160
should I have installed because I thought installing plasma meta would

995
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:38,960
sort of cover me there's not really there's there's not arch doesn't have a

996
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,840
solution for that ah install it like it is big list of installation stuff that's

997
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,640
that's some horseshit I got to be honest with you that's that's really

998
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,440
disappointing because that makes it seem like the only way I so that so that's

999
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,760
sort of the way to do it that's sort of the way to do it isn't it is install

1000
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:56,840
that anagros stuff I mean if people want literally everything and they want it

1001
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:01,480
come modified by the well not literally everything that's that's exaggeration

1002
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:06,040
you want a lot of the vast majority of the KD stack and you want the

1003
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,440
modifications that integrus does with the theming and stuff like that then

1004
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,200
yeah you could use the integrus package content and it is kind of the integrus

1005
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,560
value add on top of arch right like they're picking your defaults you don't

1006
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:19,560
need to go find all the KDE package right I might want right so it looks

1007
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,760
like it's up and oh it's already it already feels fast I've got it and I've

1008
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:29,200
got it up installed right now it it it feels oh geez oh geez the multi monitor

1009
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:33,080
setup it's no good West it's no good didn't pick the right default for you

1010
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:36,760
no it did not but this is exciting so I'm gonna play with this a little bit I

1011
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,840
have a feeling this might develop into a show I could have a show I've now lost

1012
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:47,120
all of my notes yep yep I've lost everything but I do have the plasma

1013
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,720
desktop and what's funny seeing that in the on the video version there you can

1014
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:54,280
see the windows that I can't see I don't have those on my desktop so those are on

1015
01:15:54,280 --> 01:16:00,560
the monitor across the room from me and I can't I can't you guys can see windows

1016
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,720
on the video version of the show right now that I can't see how funny is that

1017
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:08,280
how can I move okay now I'm gonna try I'm moving it yeah uh-huh where is it oh

1018
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:15,040
haha it's back I got it snake you know this is this is pretty nice this is

1019
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:19,320
feeling pretty slick you know like not like in terms of like how it's handling

1020
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:23,560
my dual monitors but it's feeling slick in terms of like how smooth everything's

1021
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:28,800
moving across the screen which is which is kind of done arch and plasma before

1022
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,320
oh yeah oh it's been a while right and every single time I do it I spend the

1023
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:37,640
first three days thinking about how much I love Kaywin that's really like every

1024
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:42,440
time every single time and then it's great it is really good but then then I

1025
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,160
miss know after a little after a little while okay I'm gonna try unifying

1026
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:50,520
outputs I'm hitting apply and let's see survey says hey look at that beautiful

1027
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:54,920
now I have dual monitor setup and so now I've got mirrored monitor setup under

1028
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:58,720
Katie I'm pretty much good to go the world just changed and look I've got

1029
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:04,240
quake still which nice yeah so I'm pretty much I'm pretty much set I think

1030
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:08,240
you'll totally switch to your quake eventually yeah or or you yeah you wake

1031
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:12,520
yeah well let's see so here's the question will I well while I have it

1032
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:15,880
installed right now and I suspect I'll have it installed for the next few days

1033
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:21,400
will I have it installed by Sunday's Linux action show and will I still have

1034
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:26,440
it installed by episode 174 that's the big question we will see if you if you

1035
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:32,480
experience all the greatness that is Katie yes thank you mr. to know wow

1036
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:36,360
that's an endorsement right there and now let's see let's get it working on

1037
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,640
Wayland let's just go all in West what do you say yeah let's do it

1038
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,520

1042
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:57,800
meat BSD I've left like two weeks ago remember when I was gone that was

1043
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,160

1046
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:55,840
oh I'm already setting up a K wallet which is the most obnoxious thing ever

1047
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,240
as soon as I have one of Google Chrome and Google Chrome doesn't look right

1048
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:02,440
that doesn't look good it's got it doesn't it doesn't look like if it

1049
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:05,560
doesn't look like it belongs on the frickin plasma desktop look at that look

1050
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:09,160
how crappy that wasn't really look like it belongs and oh wow even worse though

1051
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:13,080
yeah boy sure feels good though look at that look how good that moves that does

1052
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:17,720
feel that that's like that's like KY jelly on your screen right there that's

1053
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:23,640
nice I like that oh oh does it have that option to use like yeah yeah let's go

1054
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,280
there let's do that I think if you right-click on the top maybe or

1055
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:33,160
somewhere JB titles calm JB titles calm now we go boat now where do I go to do

1056
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:36,360
that settings instinctually go to bank suggest calm but it's still that hover

1057
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:43,040
landing page and it makes me sad oh use system titles that seems like oh okay

1058
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:47,200
that's that's better that's better it doesn't look like it belongs but that's

1059
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:55,200
better there's the if you get the GTK breezed theme it'll blend perfectly

1060
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:00,440
mm-hmm okay GTK breeze thing mr. tunnel is also there's also breeze dart for GTK

1061
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:06,840
as well I'm gonna go down the deep end will you if you have any like it tips

1062
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:09,320
for me and you want to drop them in the slack that'd be good because I kind of

1063
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:13,000
think I might want to do a lass on this and I'd like to give people tips for I'm

1064
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,200
kind of thinking I'm trying it too the first tip is to explore the wonders of

1065
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:23,360
window rules window rules yeah this is what makes K when the best people talk

1066
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:28,880
about how with you know gnome like you it'll remember where you where you have

1067
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:33,440
your window and bigger area and the size and stuff like that it doesn't remember

1068
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:41,480
workspaces unless you you know install that extension port but there's window

1069
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:47,760
rules allows you to have a whole load more control hmm that does kind of sound

1070
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,400
appealing so like I can set every time so I could say every time mpv opens up

1071
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:57,160
do this or what is it what it was it that it does for me

1072
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:06,240
I think he's I think he laughed it looked like he was he's uh he's red and

1073
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:10,240
mumble is he talking oh sorry dude oh sorry rotten there was a there was a

1074
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:14,920
rogue muting of the soundboard go ahead sorry but your answer got cut off no

1075
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:18,480
problem so basically what it does is you take

1076
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:24,880
mpv and it would say load mpv on this with size this position this when

1077
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:30,280
workspace this monitor whether it has window decorations or not whatever what

1078
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:35,280
gravity level you want of whether it has it's above all applications or only in

1079
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:42,880
a particular priority whether it has a specific shortcut associated to it let's

1080
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,520
see you can I can be great for playing clips on a filter I remember Dolph there

1081
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,240
was a problem like Dolph there's something wrong with Dolphin versus not

1082
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:52,160
a lot I can't remember but we thought with playing clips you also choose

1083
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:56,440
opacity of the window I've done like a little bit of that stuff with like when

1084
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:02,240
I was using awesome a lot but that sounds very nice to have in is that

1085
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:07,440
with with plasma with K when you set the window this like how you want it like

1086
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:12,000
the size the location the monitor blah blah and then you just go into you just

1087
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,320
start you activate the window rolls on that window and you go in and check the

1088
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:20,920
boxes like okay remember this and we're done nice that's cool all right so I'm

1089
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:25,520
gonna play with that that's a good one West you see any titles that are like a

1090
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:32,400
super awesome latest Linux updates is kind of has a nice ring to it state of

1091
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:38,920
the snaps it's a snap to run Linux the latest Linux updates it's not bad it's

1092
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:47,920
not great though well Chris get plasma burns oh shoot it's not bad oh great I

1093
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,200
don't want you to get plasma burns oh man we got to do a user error cuz Rekai

1094
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:57,800
tried out this plasma desktop on his new machine oh really oh I wish I had more

1095
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:01,820
time to do user error because that would be a great you know the people crave it

1096
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:06,040
you know what I mean it's just it's busy these days West it's busy these days

1097
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:11,120
with the holidays and the the double recordings and yeah there's actually

1098
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:19,080
something that KDE does that even gnome can't do GTK like specifically a GTK

1099
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:26,800
thing okay so if you and if you have a program that has weird like let's say for

1100
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:31,120
example you want to do dark thing like a global dark thing like I like you know

1101
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:36,680
you're gonna do probably yeah yeah there's there are some side effects and

1102
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:40,120
some applications that where you have like some things that are dark that

1103
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:44,760
shouldn't be and the biggest one of the most obvious examples is a Firefox and

1104
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:49,000
Thunderbird do it mmm yeah no is rare that I don't use I don't use Firefox or

1105
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,440
Thunderbird anymore but no it has run into that well I I've figured out the

1106
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:58,320
best option I'm actually going to make like a tutorial about it but there is a

1107
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:04,800
an environmental variable that allows you to invoke the system T said it's the

1108
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,280
text boxes and that's the biggest problem with that they're all forms

1109
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:11,760
basically you and you invoke this environment environmental variable for

1110
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:16,080
GTK and you can tell it to load a different theme than your degree global

1111
01:24:16,080 --> 01:24:22,320
settings just for that one application hmm so you can fix it by making it

1112
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:28,440
ignore the the globalization of it hmm so do you set that in the in the desktop

1113
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:34,720
file then yeah you do yeah okay so let's see I'm gonna go to audio volume

1114
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:39,600
settings the reason it's it's what the reason I brought it up is because that

1115
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:46,560
if GTK 2 has that environmental variables function and also GTK 3 but

1116
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:52,240
when gnome introduced GTK 3 support for it they broke GTK 2 support so KD is

1117
01:24:52,240 --> 01:25:00,280
the only one that actually still has both hey let's see if audio works you

1118
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:03,440
want to see yeah oh yeah you want to see you have to see you want to do a little

1119
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:09,160
little little little test because these what you got this is chrome alright I am

1120
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,280
unmuting the computer's channel we'll see if we have audio right now I have a

1121
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:21,800
YouTube video playing in Chrome at this moment yeah so I got audio working I

1122
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,640
was you know what actually in some ways I like the way the plasma desktop

1123
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:29,440
displays my desktop little notification tray items better than gnome does I'm

1124
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:33,680
sick of that little sweat out tray mm-hmm I'm done with it I'm gonna play

1125
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:37,920
I'm gonna play around with Crusader and then I'm gonna I don't know we'll see

1126
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:41,160
what we'll see if I can if I can reproduce some of my workflow stuff yeah

1127
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:44,800
see if it's production ready for for what you're doing yeah I'm kind of

1128
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,160
looking forward to this I'm gonna I'm gonna put on this I'm gonna put it

1129
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:52,600
upstairs on my machine KD the Chris last homecoming
