WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
We've been kind of scratching our heads like what is a great task match application because we've been trying to do this

00:04.800 --> 00:07.820
but that's not open source and task warrior is

00:08.800 --> 00:15.200
Complicated. I don't know why task warrior is disqualified and it just doesn't work to sort of manually sync paper notes between us all and matrix

00:15.200 --> 00:18.320
Every morning like that's not gonna cut it. Yeah, but if there's like one

00:18.840 --> 00:23.860
Universal law that seems to be just more and more true these days in free software. You're always

00:24.480 --> 00:29.140
Three solutions away from next cloud, you know, it's like you start talking about a problem

00:29.140 --> 00:30.420
two

00:30.420 --> 00:34.940
Or three other applications get mentioned and then you always inevitably end up on next cloud

00:34.940 --> 00:38.900
Of course, we were looking at next cloud tasks, which is one of their featured apps

00:39.460 --> 00:42.180
And I'm kind of impressed if you look at it

00:42.180 --> 00:45.340
It's got a great UI and then it supports caldev export

00:45.340 --> 00:50.080
So when you schedule your tasks, you could you know evolution Thunderbird?

00:51.060 --> 00:54.500
ICAO, I don't know what you use but anything that supports caldev. You could just import the dates

00:55.140 --> 00:57.540
From your task app and next cloud into your calendar

00:57.540 --> 00:59.540
That's kind of slick

01:00.180 --> 01:06.200
but you know, I sort of feel like next cloud is going through this transition and I'm curious if you guys agree, but

01:07.300 --> 01:10.760
next cloud just recently announced next cloud hub 3 and

01:11.260 --> 01:14.780
It is like a collaboration suite to the extreme next cloud

01:14.780 --> 01:20.260
Chat is more like slack now and you could share documents and preview widgets in there

01:20.260 --> 01:25.380
It's like this whole team style collaboration that has its own file system behind it, too

01:25.380 --> 01:29.580
And then they have these task systems with group collaboration

01:30.060 --> 01:36.000
They have a new mail app a new mail 2.0 app. That is a lot more advanced for a mail application

01:36.540 --> 01:38.540
It kind of feels like they're trying to build

01:39.100 --> 01:44.740
The next version of exchange but the free software version like they're really going for a collaboration suite

01:44.740 --> 01:49.120
I just found here in the apps library. There's a SharePoint back end. No

01:49.120 --> 01:55.000
Oh, it's the SharePoint killer was

02:06.760 --> 02:11.760
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris

02:11.760 --> 02:13.760
My name is Wes and my name is Brent

02:13.760 --> 02:19.720
Hello boys back together again in the studio in the beautiful smoky Pacific Northwest

02:20.000 --> 02:22.280
It's good to be here with you coming up on the show today

02:22.280 --> 02:27.680
we're chatting about a few things going on in the world of Linux that caught our attention during the road trip that we just didn't

02:27.680 --> 02:29.680
get a chance to talk about with the crazy schedule and

02:30.360 --> 02:34.080
There's some doozies in there. So we'll get to that then we'll round it out with a few stories

02:34.480 --> 02:36.640
From our friends and from the meetups out there

02:36.960 --> 02:41.880
Plus, of course, we have some boosts and pics and a lot more so before I go any further

02:41.880 --> 02:48.280
Let's say hello to that virtual log who's here every single Sunday. Hello. Mumble room time appropriate greetings. Hello

02:49.960 --> 02:56.480
Hello, and hello Brent and hello everybody up there in the quiet listening we see you in the what would that be like the lobby?

02:57.560 --> 03:03.080
Like a virtual lobby or uh, you know when they like at big events and they've got these like TV screens for the people

03:03.080 --> 03:09.400
That can't be in that main theater or what if it's more like you're behind it's actually more like you're backstage watching the show

03:09.400 --> 03:12.360
I'm true like our theater techs running everything. Yeah, they're back

03:12.360 --> 03:16.240
They're listening as we're up on stage because we're in there as we're setting up the studio

03:16.240 --> 03:19.400
You know as we're hitting your cousin and fart and stuff. They're listening to all of that

03:19.720 --> 03:21.680
So they're kind of like really behind the scenes

03:21.680 --> 03:27.380
I was gonna make it a little more glamorous if I could but yeah, that's that's basically you're gonna mention the cousin in the fartin

03:27.380 --> 03:31.920
I try not to yeah, we yeah, right theater as a surprise

03:31.920 --> 03:35.580
There's totally no cousin of fartin going on in the studio. Totally not happening

03:35.580 --> 03:43.180
Well, we're back barely perhaps but we're back barely back and I want to start by saying good morning to our friends over at

03:43.180 --> 03:46.500
Tailscale tailscale is a mesh VPN protected by wire guard

03:46.660 --> 03:53.180
We used the absolute crap out of it all of us every single person at the Airbnb

03:53.580 --> 03:58.580
Had tailscale going we were all getting access to our systems behind firewalls not

03:58.580 --> 04:05.900
Open ports for us. No, go try it out at tailscale.com. Go say good morning. Tell him Linux unplugged sent you

04:06.860 --> 04:07.860
tailscale.com

04:07.860 --> 04:13.940
Man, oh man. Okay, so we got back in last night about oh, I don't know 12 hours ago

04:13.940 --> 04:17.860
I think about maybe maybe so maybe 12 hours ago. We got back into town and

04:19.180 --> 04:23.700
The great great part about the return trip so much fun is Wes

04:23.700 --> 04:28.460
You came down to join us in Portland and you caravan back with us. Yeah, I got the full experience this time

04:28.460 --> 04:30.760
And we even got the third walkie-talkie working

04:30.820 --> 04:33.900
So and then you guys like disappeared for a while

04:33.900 --> 04:36.900
But you had what the thing was is like as long as you stay together

04:37.180 --> 04:39.180
We like when you stop to get gas right you stay together

04:39.480 --> 04:42.820
The radio still work like, you know, our radio doesn't work

04:42.820 --> 04:46.100
But you guys can continue to talk and then when you catch back up we can all talk again

04:46.100 --> 04:48.700
That was it's pretty neat how that works. Yeah, it was fun

04:48.700 --> 04:51.140
Like we could tell we're getting close again like oh, that's a dia

04:51.140 --> 04:58.100
Yeah, also dupes is probably I would imagine pretty easy to spot when you're coming up on her. She's sort of

04:58.740 --> 05:03.220
So I was realizing and I felt kind of dumb especially now after that. I've spent the night in dupes

05:03.220 --> 05:05.340
I didn't really know what she looked like from the back

05:05.340 --> 05:08.320
I was like and I could see that there'd be like, you know, especially on a weekend

05:08.540 --> 05:12.940
There could be a lot of rigs on the road sometimes sure. Yeah, and when I first pulled up on you

05:12.940 --> 05:15.720
There was someone kind of tailgating you right behind so that threw me too

05:15.720 --> 05:22.180
I was like who would drive that close to a rig that they're not associated. Oh, they do turns out they love to draft

05:22.420 --> 05:25.660
They draft in me and they get right up in there

05:25.660 --> 05:31.700
And the thing they don't realize is that I can't see them in my mirrors unless they are to the one of the sides

05:31.700 --> 05:35.160
But if they're perfectly centered, I actually can't see them when they're that close

05:35.260 --> 05:40.060
Well, if they're close enough you have that rear facing camera. Yeah, I learned that yeah, but that's dangerous

05:40.700 --> 05:42.700
Yeah, I like to hang out just right

05:42.700 --> 05:46.380
That's how bring kids 50 miles to the gallon and gas

05:47.380 --> 05:53.220
Economy, what if we get you a pie powered home assistant integrated like little like text billboard thing

05:53.220 --> 05:57.780
You know like the programmatic like little text. I like this just back off whatever you want

05:57.780 --> 06:02.740
Yeah, maybe you integrate it with like a little speech to text you so you can sort of shout at something and then just like

06:02.740 --> 06:04.300
Puts it on the back. Oh, I like that

06:04.300 --> 06:08.660
I mean you brought up the whole home assistant raspberry pie thing a little too soon. I'm still grieving but

06:08.660 --> 06:15.860
Yeah, yeah, but I'm for grief. You've got systems to build man. Why are you grieving again? I didn't oh, come on

06:16.500 --> 06:19.980
That's salt in the wound my server and you know now like, you know

06:19.980 --> 06:22.140
Like back home the kids are over and I'm like I got it

06:22.140 --> 06:26.260
I got to explain to the kids it's gonna get a little cold here tonight because there's no system running the heat

06:26.660 --> 06:29.180
Sorry, like, you know, sorry about that everybody

06:29.860 --> 06:33.220
It's embarrassing family fail. We're gonna work on that

06:33.220 --> 06:38.900
We're ripping the whole system out tonight after the show and we're gonna replace it with my home assistant yellow and rebuild

06:39.900 --> 06:42.420
And rebuild eventually, we'll let you know how it goes

06:42.860 --> 06:47.460
So this came up right as we were leaving right as we were hitting the road

06:47.940 --> 06:52.860
Word came down that fedora was dropping a video acceleration

06:53.300 --> 06:59.740
for h264 h265 and VC one codecs due to a legal concern and

06:59.740 --> 07:06.460
It seems that this will primarily affect AMD GPU users using open-source drivers

07:06.700 --> 07:11.140
so if you have done the hard work of switching off in video and

07:12.020 --> 07:15.580
buying AMD pure systems so that way you can have a

07:16.500 --> 07:23.540
3d accelerated environment that is completely open source vote with your wallet. They say you're getting particularly screwed by this

07:23.540 --> 07:30.580
Ironically if you install an NVIDIA graphics card and install their binary proprietary driver

07:31.580 --> 07:37.300
You don't have this problem. You got nothing to worry about so it kind of actually incentivizes using the proprietary driver, which is

07:37.820 --> 07:44.740
Funny how that works out. It also affects any user who uses like any other open-source graphics

07:44.740 --> 07:49.540
Like oh, I don't know Intel graphics users. You also will no longer get

07:50.100 --> 07:52.100
video accelerated decoding

07:52.100 --> 07:59.380
There's been talk about maybe other distributions doing this or not and ultimately it comes down to legal concerns

08:00.100 --> 08:02.100
Red Hat legal is

08:02.340 --> 08:05.060
concerned that they may be exposed to a lawsuit and

08:05.940 --> 08:11.500
when a decision like this is made it actually exposes the real power structure behind fedora and

08:12.300 --> 08:17.580
It's not that fedora isn't a community-run distribution. It absolutely is it's that when?

08:17.580 --> 08:25.780
Red Hat legal gets heartburn about something fedora has to jump into action because if fedora were to become a legal liability for Red Hat

08:25.780 --> 08:32.900
I would imagine the project status would become tenuous. And so the project's incentivized to

08:33.940 --> 08:41.460
Over react to these concerns and as a result they fuck their end users over and over and over again

08:41.460 --> 08:46.660
I was just looking it was like July or June of 2020 where Firefox

08:46.660 --> 08:48.660
finally

08:48.860 --> 08:55.860
Finally got hardware accelerated video playback in Wayland and it was celebrated at the time on fedora finally gets this and

08:56.700 --> 09:01.540
Yet about a year later. Here we are. They now take us away and

09:02.580 --> 09:05.460
Other distributions don't seem to be quite as worried about this

09:05.700 --> 09:12.560
But they don't have this vulnerability that the fedora project has and it's a great project and it's primarily community-run

09:12.560 --> 09:19.720
But this really shows us who's in charge, doesn't it? And I think it's a really kind of unfortunate thing because it's once again end

09:19.920 --> 09:21.920
users that are getting

09:22.280 --> 09:28.280
And it once again shows us why companies like Google have to come along and create a product like Chrome OS to actually make Linux

09:28.280 --> 09:33.560
Usable for end users because we can't count on the distributions that are community-run to actually be able to do these things

09:34.360 --> 09:37.280
It's an interesting time. We live in when Debian can vote to include

09:38.160 --> 09:40.400
Proprietary firmware on their installer all of a sudden

09:40.400 --> 09:44.920
But fedora can't decode that video. They were decoding for you yesterday

09:45.600 --> 09:52.520
it just doesn't make a lot of sense, but in the end it's Linux users who always have to constantly navigate these changing rules and

09:52.880 --> 09:55.800
Once again, it's fedora. That's making a change like this. I

09:56.640 --> 10:01.280
Just find it really disappointing. I understand why they have to do it and you know realistically

10:02.800 --> 10:04.800
We're all gonna be able to figure out how to work around it

10:05.440 --> 10:07.440
It's not gonna be our problem. It's yeah

10:07.440 --> 10:11.520
It's the sort of oh I wanted to give this a shot and I have no idea where to start with

10:11.640 --> 10:16.640
Understanding why this thing that just works. I don't ever have to think about on other systems doesn't over here

10:16.640 --> 10:20.360
Yeah, that's the tragedy of it, and I just took a little look skis before the show

10:20.360 --> 10:22.280
I'm sure this will change with time

10:22.280 --> 10:23.720
But it'll take time

10:23.720 --> 10:28.400
But I just a little look sees before the show and was looking up video acceleration for Firefox

10:28.920 --> 10:35.960
And guess what all the wiki pages all the tutorials all the blog posts all the YouTube videos talk about it

10:35.960 --> 10:37.560
Like it's a working feature

10:37.560 --> 10:39.440
It's something you can do on fedora

10:39.440 --> 10:45.960
so now imagine when you install the next version of fedora and it doesn't work and there just hasn't been enough time for Google and

10:45.960 --> 10:51.480
Everything to re-index and so you go searching for it and all the guides and all the things just talk about it

10:51.480 --> 10:53.480
Like it actually works just fine out of the box

10:54.440 --> 10:57.080
you're gonna get totally gas-lit like what a mind job and

10:57.400 --> 11:01.600
if if all of a sudden could you imagine if all of a sudden

11:01.600 --> 11:06.000
Apple announced that macOS wasn't gonna be able to play back h.264 videos

11:09.120 --> 11:12.240
And I realized fedora is no Apple and they're definitely not but

11:12.760 --> 11:17.440
it does strike me as a decision that was user hostile and

11:17.760 --> 11:23.440
You know, it's kind of unfortunate because fedora has a history of doing this and it's kind of changed my perspective a little bit

11:25.000 --> 11:29.520
And I think it's just sort of the vulnerability that they have as a project and it's just sort of the compromise

11:29.520 --> 11:35.080
We have to accept is that if Red Hat legal has a little bit of heartburn about some concern that might happen to them that

11:35.080 --> 11:40.120
They could just shake off financially like it's no big deal or you know, I don't know. Here's a idea license it

11:40.120 --> 11:46.960
They're rich they could license it but no no instead all users who help us beta test this thing that make our product that actually

11:46.960 --> 11:48.200
Pays the bills

11:48.200 --> 11:53.480
They're the ones that get screwed. It is sort of an interesting. I think maybe it highlights the unique maybe not unique but

11:53.480 --> 11:59.500
Particular situation that have fedora is structured just thinking, you know, we're used to community run distros

11:59.500 --> 12:04.480
No money to tangle in some of these legal things just because like what they they're not gonna pay legal bills or have a lawyer

12:04.480 --> 12:08.480
they have limited funding to begin with and it reminds me of

12:09.800 --> 12:15.120
economicals legal sort of being willing to step out on a limb or what some people thought of a limb with the adding the

12:15.680 --> 12:17.220
CFS module compiled, you know

12:17.220 --> 12:22.320
So in some circumstances having like a corporate sponsor when who's willing to take those risks

12:22.320 --> 12:27.120
It can be something that you know those type of Linux distributions benefit from but that's not really the case

12:27.280 --> 12:30.640
Even though there is somewhat attached it it falls more on that community side

12:30.640 --> 12:33.480
Well, and that is assuming that they could buy a license, you know

12:34.320 --> 12:38.360
What do you want to buy a perpetual license forever for an indefinite amount?

12:38.360 --> 12:40.680
it may be one of these situations where they can't buy it and

12:41.360 --> 12:45.160
It just as a that makes it even more complicated and it doesn't speak to

12:45.840 --> 12:48.680
Linux's ability to compete as a commercial desktop platform

12:48.680 --> 12:54.800
If we can't even get past hurdles like this and I acknowledge it's a tough spot and maybe and I think you might be familiar

12:54.800 --> 12:57.840
with with because this happened a few weeks ago, so I'm starting to get fady on it, but

12:58.360 --> 13:02.440
What happened was a change upstream in Mesa to kind of kick this entire thing off?

13:02.800 --> 13:06.240
That's why all of this came up all of a sudden. That's why there's a change to begin with

13:06.240 --> 13:09.480
I don't know do West you recall what some of those changes were upstream

13:09.760 --> 13:14.560
Straight over a matrix has a nice little summary that before this stuff was kind of just included in Mesa

13:14.560 --> 13:19.360
I guess some thought maybe as an oversight before or at least in the the way that it was getting pulled into fedora

13:19.480 --> 13:23.080
Now you need a build up an explicit build option if you want these codecs

13:23.360 --> 13:29.520
So the non free things can be cut out in a technical sense in a way that before May I think roughly

13:29.960 --> 13:31.720
It was not necessarily easy to do so

13:31.720 --> 13:32.520
I

13:32.520 --> 13:36.960
So now there's a little more scrutiny and if you're gonna have to like when this update comes out you update that and now you have

13:36.960 --> 13:41.360
To explicitly add build flags to enable these non free things that raises a lot of questions

13:41.360 --> 13:45.960
So now you're making a proactive choice, right? You're making this kind of like rolled in with

13:45.960 --> 13:50.800
Yeah, Carl points out to you. There's some trickiness and we can't I think we should talk about just the very unfortunate

13:51.520 --> 13:54.400
This would all be so much easy in a world where we weren't trying to deal with these

13:54.560 --> 13:58.280
You know the horribly licensed codecs like any license that Red Hat

13:58.520 --> 14:01.400
Paid for could result in restrictions on fedora itself

14:01.400 --> 14:05.600
Whereas like because there are restrictions right on these proprietary OS is they want to know when you're installing that you got to get it

14:05.600 --> 14:09.200
From them, whereas we don't think about that in the open source sense

14:09.200 --> 14:14.600
And I guess mpeg la is not really interested in granting unlimited licenses. Anyway. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah

14:14.600 --> 14:15.400
See, that's just what I think

14:15.400 --> 14:19.920
It's just like we're it's such a it's such a tough spot for like what we think of is this basic sort of human, right?

14:19.920 --> 14:23.200
Of like you should have software that makes your machine fully operate

14:23.200 --> 14:27.200
And that's not how a lot of the rest of the structures of society are set up to do

14:27.320 --> 14:32.000
It's one of those things where I get now so a willful choice is being made and that is a legal thing

14:32.000 --> 14:37.240
I get it, but it would be so much nicer if what we could do instead was

14:37.240 --> 14:43.460
Wait for a letter that says hey, we think you're infringing before this change happens, you know before we just throw all these users under the bus or

14:45.720 --> 14:50.600
Wait for a single person to get sued over this in this in this manner like

14:51.920 --> 14:54.120
Not that I'm arguing for reactionary

14:54.120 --> 14:59.280
but at the same time when you make a change like this is the equivalent of removing the ability to do mp3s and

15:00.000 --> 15:03.520
kind of makes me sick that I've been doing this for 15 years and

15:03.520 --> 15:09.000
This is what we were talking about 15 years ago. And here we are 15 effing years later

15:09.000 --> 15:12.880
I mean, it's just yeah, I'm thinking about switching all next minute. I know right mp3s, man

15:12.880 --> 15:18.320
I mean, that's why I meant was a thing right and so that's just sort of wild but I I understand what you're saying

15:18.320 --> 15:23.120
But I'm not totally sure I'm convinced in the business incentives for

15:23.760 --> 15:31.160
The h264 consortium to sue people for using h264 and playing back video because it only broadens their market share

15:31.160 --> 15:35.640
It only increases their monopoly. It only strengthens their position in the market

15:35.640 --> 15:40.920
So it doesn't seem like they're very incentivized to go after people that are using consuming

15:41.440 --> 15:43.360
distributing h264

15:43.360 --> 15:48.360
It seems like you know, probably they're going after set-top box manufacturers

15:48.960 --> 15:50.640
cable providers

15:50.640 --> 15:51.600
televisions

15:51.600 --> 15:57.000
Blu-ray makers that's the kind of people that you know that they can get that they can extract millions out of

15:57.000 --> 16:01.920
But going after somebody like the RIAA did back in the day for pirating mp3s

16:01.920 --> 16:05.680
That's just not the world we live in anymore. It just doesn't make sense. They're never gonna make a dime at that

16:06.400 --> 16:11.920
So I don't really know what the risk factor is. I guarantee that I can't just I know I understand

16:11.920 --> 16:14.400
I can't come here and say guarantee. Well, they're not gonna sue I can't do that

16:14.560 --> 16:18.880
So there so since the risk factor is you know, at least 1% or whatever

16:18.880 --> 16:27.360
They're gonna respond this way and Carl sums it up nicely over in matrix. This whole thing is a mess. Yeah, it is it is

16:27.360 --> 16:27.960
It just you know

16:27.960 --> 16:32.400
and I think what's so upsetting about it at the core of it is it doesn't seem like there's a

16:32.560 --> 16:34.760
right answer for the fedora project and

16:35.280 --> 16:40.000
It seems like it's a tougher question for fedora than it is for every other Linux distribution

16:40.000 --> 16:45.440
and I find that frustrating and then the other thing that I find frustrating is that there is a history of giving and taking a

16:45.640 --> 16:48.120
little bit in features and I find that to be a

16:48.120 --> 16:53.000
little bit aggravating and then it's like we just started to solve the Nvidia driver problem

16:53.000 --> 16:55.840
We just started to get decent flat hub integration

16:55.920 --> 16:59.880
We really started around the corner on codecs and being able to do all this stuff

16:59.880 --> 17:05.120
Like it really was removing some friction and barriers of entry to fedora

17:05.120 --> 17:13.000
And it was really truly making it possible to recommend one of the great distributions to everybody and now those barriers are

17:13.000 --> 17:20.400
Starting to go back up. It is a form of free software gatekeeping and it's happening now at one of the I think most important

17:20.480 --> 17:22.480
Distributions and I'm just sad about it

17:22.480 --> 17:28.020
Yeah, there was kind of this era where like it felt like at least a lot of this sort of commentary layer would advise

17:28.020 --> 17:30.840
You know like well if you're gonna go through you're probably gonna need something like rp infusion

17:30.840 --> 17:32.440
Yeah, I'd have all these work around to that now

17:32.440 --> 17:37.260
But and for a while it felt like we weren't like we'd really gotten to a point that you know for some esoteric use cases

17:37.260 --> 17:38.360
Yeah, you got to figure out some stuff out

17:38.360 --> 17:44.920
But for just normal using a computer stuff fedora had really gotten just installed and forget. Yeah, I agree

17:46.640 --> 17:49.760
And I understand it too doesn't mean I'm not frustrated by it

17:49.760 --> 17:53.620
I'm we're obviously still gonna use an install and love fedora, but yeah

17:54.120 --> 17:58.160
Yeah, it's just now I'm gonna be getting that stuff from I don't know wherever I can get it

17:58.240 --> 18:00.880
You know if I have to go down a shady alley on the internet

18:00.880 --> 18:04.360
Oh, yeah, I've got a sketchily compiled copper that you might want to check out

18:04.360 --> 18:09.020
Maybe fluendo is gonna get another 80 bucks out of me or something. I don't know. That's what I used to have to do

18:09.020 --> 18:13.840
Back in the days to go buy my codecs and I'd put them in my folder so that way I could play my mp3s on

18:13.840 --> 18:15.480
fedora

18:15.480 --> 18:22.320
Alright, so there's another story going on on the internet right now that I thought we should talk about because we just haven't really gotten

18:22.320 --> 18:23.440
a chance and

18:23.440 --> 18:32.440
that is that the internet has discovered through some sleuthing that pop and the cosmic desktop is going to make use of a

18:32.440 --> 18:34.920
rust based toolkit called iced

18:42.800 --> 18:45.600
And they're doing this in place of GTK

18:45.760 --> 18:53.320
So this is a replacement for a GTK and the news here is that cosmic was believed to be a GTK based desktop environment

18:53.320 --> 18:59.080
but it seems that system 76 has evaluated their options and have picked the direction of

18:59.720 --> 19:01.240
iced and

19:01.240 --> 19:05.040
this was noticed by individuals on reddit and

19:06.400 --> 19:10.040
Then a discussion kicked off from there and I thought before we got to the discussion

19:10.040 --> 19:15.680
Maybe we talked a little bit about iced and kind of what it is and what the goals are

19:15.680 --> 19:18.280
So simply as I understand it is a cross-platform

19:18.840 --> 19:25.720
GUI library and it is as you may have noticed written in rust and it has a focus on simplicity and

19:26.040 --> 19:28.240
type safety as many things in rust do and

19:28.240 --> 19:34.700
And Wes you were mentioning that it's been inspired by something that maybe is a pretty good sign for this type of use case

19:34.740 --> 19:36.660
Yeah, it's inspired by Elm

19:36.660 --> 19:43.980
which is a front-end framework and and language but heavily inspired by functional reactive programming and functional programming in general and

19:44.620 --> 19:49.740
it's a different model of how you think about modeling UIs and states and

19:50.260 --> 19:54.300
Instead of sort of the older style that that GTK definitely is this promotes like you're separating

19:54.300 --> 19:59.980
The things that implement how your stuff gets rendered from the data that describes the tree that you are rendering

19:59.980 --> 20:03.580
And so you can kind of operate in a style where you describe what you want it

20:03.580 --> 20:08.740
It's a it's a more declarative approach where you say like I need I want it to look like this and the underlying engine can

20:08.740 --> 20:12.740
Figure out how do I take what we've got now and make it there instead of a much more

20:13.000 --> 20:17.580
Imperative sort of procedural style that a lot of traditional UI programming has been right

20:17.580 --> 20:22.860
But it would seem like the the mobile operating systems have been making a steady march towards declarative UI design and which

20:22.860 --> 20:27.360
Accommodates a lot of different mobile use cases and size screen sizes and whatnot, right?

20:27.360 --> 20:27.900
Well, I mean, yeah

20:27.900 --> 20:31.460
You saw it in the front end and react has some of this at some of its underlying principles

20:31.460 --> 20:36.620
Elm really defined the like that the data flow model in one way data flows and you sort of update your data and then that

20:36.620 --> 20:41.340
Sort of can reactively cascade and then update the parts of the UI that need to get updated without you having to sort of

20:41.780 --> 20:43.780
explicitly say that and

20:44.020 --> 20:47.020
It turns out people like that approach or similar approaches

20:47.100 --> 20:52.420
Especially if you can get the efficiency, right which seems like rust has a lot of opportunities to do that

20:52.420 --> 20:57.020
But you've seen like Swift UI is an example of adopting some of that compared to the you know

20:57.020 --> 21:01.100
the older objective C standards Swift UI is embracing some of the same thing, so I

21:01.860 --> 21:03.460
Don't know how I've never used ice

21:03.460 --> 21:08.740
I can't say how knife is experience it is but I think if you're trying to target developers who do

21:08.860 --> 21:10.860
UI work in the modern world

21:10.980 --> 21:13.060
They'll have heard about maybe they haven't used down

21:13.060 --> 21:18.300
But this is a model that they're gonna be familiar with and I don't know. I still haven't really learned how to use GTK

21:18.300 --> 21:21.780
And yeah, I mean GTK is certainly popular

21:21.780 --> 21:26.800
But it doesn't seem like it's lit the world on fire and there's a lot of momentum around rust based of it

21:26.800 --> 21:28.300
There's that element of it

21:28.300 --> 21:30.400
And I don't know if I could really you know

21:30.900 --> 21:32.780
Declare which one has more technical merits

21:32.780 --> 21:38.300
But it seems the team at system 76 really likes what ice has to offer for what they want to build and obviously it seems

21:38.300 --> 21:41.780
I mean, it's obviously new right system 76 as well. We'll get into here

21:41.780 --> 21:47.740
There's gonna be need to be contributions to make iced fully functional GTK right is has a lot of functionality

21:47.740 --> 21:50.540
I think no, we're not trying to say this could be directly comparable

21:50.540 --> 21:51.940
Yeah, it's not feature to feature for sure

21:51.940 --> 21:56.580
But there are some reasons why just used to GTK maybe isn't interesting to all developers

21:56.700 --> 22:02.220
Do we know of any other projects using ice at this point or any projects we can look at to see maybe its capabilities?

22:02.500 --> 22:05.260
We were taking a look earlier today at the iced toolkit

22:06.120 --> 22:08.420
Which we will have a link to in the show notes

22:08.420 --> 22:12.620
And so you might be able to from there figure out who else is using this they have a lot of examples

22:12.940 --> 22:16.540
So I would like to try some software that's using this that might be something we tracked down

22:16.540 --> 22:21.020
It is they do note on their github that it's currently experimental. So who knows things may change

22:21.020 --> 22:26.860
I don't we'll get into this too, but it didn't seem like, you know system 76 weren't really coming out and

22:28.060 --> 22:30.060
announcing a bunch of this

22:30.420 --> 22:36.940
Maybe we should also view some of this as like exploring. Oh, hey, we're we know that they've heavily adopted rust internally

22:36.940 --> 22:39.340
They've got people there who are comfortable using it like using it

22:39.340 --> 22:44.260
And so if you did see like oh, there's a new approach to doing cross-platform GUI stuff

22:44.260 --> 22:47.580
I wonder if this could work for some of our some of our software

22:47.580 --> 22:47.900
Yeah

22:47.900 --> 22:52.860
That was the sense I got is they were building widgets internally that kind of reached a point where like we got to decide and what?

22:52.860 --> 22:55.600
We're gonna do here and ice just seemed like the way they wanted to go

22:56.100 --> 22:59.260
they want to say this is our GUI toolkit for cosmic and

22:59.860 --> 23:02.740
They said they deliberated about it a lot and decided to go with iced

23:03.420 --> 23:05.100
and I I

23:05.100 --> 23:07.300
Have seen the reaction to this and we'll get to that a moment

23:07.980 --> 23:13.060
But my general take on this is that we'll see we'll see where they go

23:13.060 --> 23:18.020
we'll see if they get the accessibility stuff added I think they've got the motivation and the determination to do it and

23:19.060 --> 23:22.220
Pop is a reasonably sized distribution

23:22.220 --> 23:28.580
But it isn't the largest player out there and it seems to me that it's in that in that almost perfect market position

23:29.020 --> 23:33.240
To experiment with this kind of stuff where they'll get a good user base

23:33.240 --> 23:38.420
They'll get a really good amount of varied feedback because they have a diverse user set they have feedback channels, right?

23:38.420 --> 23:43.340
I mean they have they have short lines and sure it does seem like they have conversations with their user base to some extent

23:43.340 --> 23:46.660
So yeah, they absolutely will get support tickets to when things don't work

23:46.660 --> 23:50.280
There's that element because they're selling a product that runs this stuff too. So they get that channel

23:50.280 --> 23:52.580
It's not getting thrown into the void. Really? That's what I'm trying to say

23:52.580 --> 23:52.820
Yeah

23:52.820 --> 23:58.020
I think that's probably a fair assessment and I think it's a good size to experiment and see how things go and

23:58.100 --> 24:02.380
It's not like they're creating a bunch of proprietary code. That's only gonna work on cosmic

24:02.380 --> 24:09.500
So if they build something that seems pretty reasonable, well, then maybe the folks over at mint can take a look at it

24:09.500 --> 24:11.300
You know something something like that

24:11.300 --> 24:16.980
So I feel like they're kind of in the perfect position to be an R&D lab for this type of endeavor

24:16.980 --> 24:21.060
I think that's just fine because if it goes horribly wrong

24:21.060 --> 24:27.020
It doesn't really hurt the rest of the Linux desktop in the upstream projects and if it goes tremendously well

24:27.460 --> 24:31.260
Then that's free software that anybody can adapt and use if they want to

24:31.260 --> 24:34.460
Will they that's the other question

24:35.540 --> 24:38.620
the as they say bad blood here is

24:39.260 --> 24:41.860
I think getting to an impasse and

24:42.700 --> 24:45.800
This time around as Cassidy put it on Twitter

24:46.420 --> 24:50.900
The annual flare-up was kicked off based on a comment

24:51.340 --> 24:56.140
Made by a different system system 76 engineer in my opinion

24:56.260 --> 25:00.740
It basically was just stating kind of matter of the fact why GTK wasn't working for them

25:00.740 --> 25:01.900
and

25:01.900 --> 25:05.860
I think you could argue the original iteration of the post wasn't

25:07.020 --> 25:12.580
Probably as delicate as it could have been but it wasn't really necessarily hostile either. It was just matter of fact

25:13.340 --> 25:19.380
And it essentially said that GTK just wasn't the best choice for the job and they preferred iced and kind of went to some reasons

25:19.420 --> 25:26.180
But the way that GTK was described I think kicked off a whole new round of online battles

25:26.180 --> 25:31.060
Just has been a mess since then. Mm-hmm, and it can be tough sometimes when you're looking, you know

25:31.060 --> 25:34.500
And especially in various community forums. What's the scope?

25:34.500 --> 25:39.820
Do you interpret this as a statement of fact from someone who's trying to assert a position or is it a more of a like?

25:39.820 --> 25:45.500
An you know, IMO this is how I view this and think about it for my use cases. I don't know

25:45.500 --> 25:49.660
you never say those things so they just sort of implicit in yeah, they're stated as an implicit statement and

25:49.660 --> 25:55.420
We'll have links to all of some of this all of some of this in the show notes

25:55.420 --> 26:00.020
It's kind of ridiculous for the most part a brief summary. I would describe it as I

26:00.820 --> 26:02.380
think

26:02.380 --> 26:05.100
the gnome team has been

26:05.900 --> 26:09.460
sensitive about comments made by engineers at system 76 and

26:09.900 --> 26:15.460
I think they've transitioned from being sensitive about those comments to being sensitive about the fact that

26:15.460 --> 26:22.820
Something hasn't happened to those employees to penalize them for those statements or prevent them from making future statements

26:22.820 --> 26:24.820
And so now it's kind of become

26:26.260 --> 26:28.260
Gnome camp against system 76

26:28.900 --> 26:34.500
which of course creates a hostile work environment and they throw shade back and forth at each other and

26:35.100 --> 26:41.200
if you think that one side is has the moral high ground here, then you're probably not familiar with the argument because

26:41.200 --> 26:48.000
there is I think a point on both sides and it's one of these things that I think also in my personal opinion is

26:48.800 --> 26:54.840
Spurred on by the fact that there may be a bit of concern that iced once it's been properly

26:55.520 --> 27:01.800
Contributed to and has enough features may be a genuine alternative to something like GTK and perhaps

27:01.800 --> 27:05.280
It's created a little bit of defensiveness from the gnome side. Yeah, it may not be true

27:05.280 --> 27:07.280
But that is how it's kind of coming across

27:07.280 --> 27:12.040
Especially when you see the discussions that are going on in their matrix chat room, and I think we've all been in places

27:12.040 --> 27:14.360
rightfully, or wrong only, you know when we see

27:15.360 --> 27:17.200
ambitious or not new

27:17.200 --> 27:21.520
Approaches in the Linux community. I think we're sensitive to like another one of those, you know

27:21.520 --> 27:27.960
We have several cross-platform gooey toolkits like yeah, right or we have a package manager like that. I know you have your own ideas

27:27.960 --> 27:32.960
I I don't think you know we get we're allowed to have those thoughts. We should be careful. Maybe how we articulate them because

27:32.960 --> 27:38.720
That's always gonna happen. That's what happens in our free software world, right? Things things change new stuff. Get it opposite it wins

27:39.560 --> 27:45.040
Contests either on merits or just on popularity. I the other part of this I found interesting though was

27:45.560 --> 27:47.320
When cosmic was sort of first launched

27:47.320 --> 27:51.960
We weren't sure what it was cuz it's kind of like a collection of plugins and is it like is it really just you know

27:51.960 --> 27:57.160
Is it just you know? Yeah, so this to me signals like there might be a lot more interesting to watch in the cosmic space

27:57.160 --> 28:01.040
Generally, right that's kind of how I see it. It's like, okay. Well now we all of a sudden have ourselves

28:01.040 --> 28:06.920
A genuine new contribution here. That's actually based on some technologies that you know

28:06.920 --> 28:10.480
If you're just looking at things from the surface level and you're like I I would like my

28:10.800 --> 28:13.240
Desktop to be built with these tools or these tools

28:13.240 --> 28:17.160
I would actually if I was just hitting the reset button, I would also probably pick iced

28:17.160 --> 28:19.240
I mean look at it. It looks pretty great

28:19.240 --> 28:23.200
And then Jeremy's got I mean the team does but I think Jeremy's been primarily updating it

28:23.200 --> 28:29.240
He's got a checklist going which I have linked in the show notes about things that are going into iced for cosmic about accessibility

28:29.240 --> 28:35.320
Features and font and issues and they have identified a lot of things that they want to contribute upstream and they have been I

28:35.320 --> 28:39.320
Found at least three and there may be more but I found I think at least three

28:39.320 --> 28:42.280
Contributions from the system 76 team to iced upstream

28:42.280 --> 28:48.280
So there the work is going in and this is just beginning and I think you're right. Let them experiment. I feel like they need a summit

28:48.800 --> 28:53.920
Like they need a Switzerland to come in and and a gnome system 76 summit

28:53.920 --> 29:00.520
If I were Carl, I would be considering maybe flying out some of the gnome team to system 76 and just showing them what you're doing

29:00.520 --> 29:04.920
Showing them your team meeting the team in person because that's always a different experience

29:05.400 --> 29:07.400
Taking them out treating them

29:07.560 --> 29:10.760
thanking them for their contributions for what you can build on top of and

29:11.080 --> 29:16.920
And recognizing that stuff and celebrating that stuff and seeing if that doesn't create some kind of bridge because when I watch the discourse

29:17.720 --> 29:19.720
this time around I

29:19.720 --> 29:23.560
Feel like the fouls may be on the gnome side and I grant that

29:24.400 --> 29:30.600
Initial language could have been a little more diplomatic, but the reaction the plotting all of that

29:30.600 --> 29:32.600
that's really on the gnome side and

29:33.760 --> 29:38.840
Unfortunately, I still think it's on system 76 to fix it. You know the gnome sides volunteers

29:38.840 --> 29:44.560
They're people scratching an itch system 76 side their employees people building a product

29:45.120 --> 29:48.120
Trying to make money. Maybe I don't want to make money

29:48.120 --> 29:53.120
Trying to make money. Maybe I have a stronger notion of a sort of collective representation that you know

29:53.120 --> 29:58.200
Folks don't you know can be tough to interpret to like a speaking as a person in the project or just as a person in your

29:58.200 --> 30:01.240
Own who has your own opinions about these things and the people involved and yeah

30:01.240 --> 30:06.680
I don't think this situation gets better until some side just puts their hands up does the mea culpa and just

30:06.920 --> 30:12.640
Bears and grins it and I think I mean, right? Yeah, I mean I respect really all the people involved

30:12.640 --> 30:17.480
There's a lot of important work happening. I use all of this software and I want to continue to do so

30:17.480 --> 30:19.480
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I hope I hope it gets worked out

30:19.480 --> 30:20.840
I really do and

30:20.840 --> 30:26.920
I'm also very interested to see what gets built and if any of any new ideas can get explored from this so stay tuned

30:26.920 --> 30:28.920
We'll let you know

30:30.640 --> 30:35.520
Linode comm slash unplugged go there to get a hundred dollars and 60-day credit on a new account

30:35.520 --> 30:39.000
And what a great way to support the show because you try out something fantastic like Linode

30:39.640 --> 30:44.760
And you support the show Linode makes cloud computing simple affordable and accessible

30:44.760 --> 30:49.680
They're 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the hyperscalers that want to lock you into their crazy platforms

30:50.000 --> 30:54.800
They also have fantastic support and the thing you guys know, I always care about performance

30:55.480 --> 31:01.200
In my opinion, it's the best and it's just not something I just randomly came to I tried them all

31:01.960 --> 31:07.480
I've tried them all and nothing's as good as Linode. Let me tell you and I'm not the only one that says that

31:07.960 --> 31:12.720
There are independent studies that verify that as well, you know, it's it's kind of a simple math

31:12.720 --> 31:15.200
Really they started about 19 years ago

31:15.320 --> 31:21.680
they had to be really good to survive especially when businesses that started as bookstores came along and realized they had a bunch of

31:22.160 --> 31:27.640
Extra infrastructure they could sell and make even more money and then other cloud providers got in the game because they realized hey

31:27.640 --> 31:31.500
There's this cloud thing and we can call stuff whatever we want and charge whatever we want. It's great

31:31.500 --> 31:35.000
It's just so great. And so they invested from their other products

31:35.000 --> 31:40.320
Maybe their operating system market or their book sales or maybe some VC guys just can't work out

31:40.320 --> 31:42.520
Just came in and just started dumping money in there

31:43.280 --> 31:45.280
Linode had to compete with all of that

31:45.400 --> 31:50.560
While just building a good product to do it. So that means they've got fantastic dedicated support

31:50.560 --> 31:57.640
That means they have the best performance. They've got 11 data centers today. That's fantastic and they are their own ISP, but coming soon

31:58.400 --> 32:01.300
There's gonna be more than a dozen new Linode data centers

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
They're turning it up past 11

32:04.600 --> 32:08.200
2023 is gonna be such a great year for Linode and that's kind of the point

32:08.200 --> 32:15.420
I think I would just want to leave with you when I'm deploying infrastructure. I want something I can just leave running for three five

32:15.920 --> 32:19.840
Maybe even longer, you know years. I'd love to have something that's up there eight years

32:19.840 --> 32:21.840
You know if we could keep it up to date maintain it. I

32:22.240 --> 32:24.120
Don't want to have to rebuild and move this stuff

32:24.120 --> 32:29.720
So that's one of the big calculus is that goes into who I pick as my cloud infrastructure provider

32:29.720 --> 32:34.320
And that's why when I just look at all of the things it's Linode every single time

32:34.320 --> 32:38.240
And that's why they're willing to give you $100 so you can try it yourself

32:39.120 --> 32:43.760
You can form a complete opinion because $100 at their pricing means you can really try things out

32:44.160 --> 32:50.400
So go support the show and grab that $100 and try out Linode. It's Linode.com slash unplugged you go there

32:50.400 --> 32:53.860
You support the show. It's a great way to thank them for supporting our road trip

32:54.360 --> 33:01.240
Making the West Coast tour possible as well as checking out their service and kicking the tires Linode.com slash

33:01.240 --> 33:05.240
unplugged

33:05.640 --> 33:08.960
We do have some things to chat about here in the housekeeping

33:08.960 --> 33:15.720
I want to give a big old plug skis for the matrix room any of them Jupiter broadcasting.com slash matrix join our decentralized chat

33:15.720 --> 33:20.080
It's pretty simple to go create yourself a matrix.org account or set up a home server

33:20.160 --> 33:22.400
Not as simple that way but you can do that as well

33:22.840 --> 33:24.320
You come in here and you join us

33:24.320 --> 33:29.120
we're gonna keep our West Coast crew room going because we're gonna have future West Coast trips and as we

33:29.120 --> 33:33.480
Expand out and do our next future thing. We'll set up chat rooms

33:33.560 --> 33:41.200
In fact, there's a petition going around around right now to create a Portland specific chat room. Yeah, I may may have made some promises and

33:42.440 --> 33:46.560
Actually, I'm I guess I'm making promises for you Chris because you're the one who ultimately makes the room

33:46.560 --> 33:50.920
So I guess I couldn't I forgot about that. I thought West had to do all things like that

33:51.280 --> 33:53.280
But it turns out I do have the power

33:53.280 --> 33:58.440
Yeah, and I also I want to just put on your radar for all things open coming up

33:58.440 --> 34:00.560
I know Alex from self-hosted is gonna be there

34:00.560 --> 34:04.040
There's gonna be some other community members that are making it to all things open

34:04.080 --> 34:09.040
But we don't have any current meetups to plug. That's it for right now. We'll find out about future events pretty soon

34:09.800 --> 34:13.440
But doesn't that feel kind of weird? I've got a few in the works that I yeah

34:13.960 --> 34:17.720
May not have well, you know shower thoughts, but Wes and I may have one coming up

34:17.720 --> 34:19.760
But we don't quite want to announce it just wow

34:19.800 --> 34:23.480
So you guys are gonna just hold your own little private meetup without me. Is that what's happening?

34:23.480 --> 34:25.480
Oh

34:25.760 --> 34:30.880
My god audience Chris's are fine audience right right just not this one. Yeah, cuz I got you

34:30.880 --> 34:35.320
Well, you'll be busy with some other things that we're cooking up. This is a interesting

34:38.220 --> 34:44.320
We do have some baller boosts to get to we like to feature the high amount boosts that came into the show to really support

34:44.320 --> 34:49.360
the production each episode and the first one this week came Zins from

34:49.360 --> 34:54.740
What what came Zin it came Zins from sir lurks a lot

34:56.680 --> 35:02.520
52,118 sets the truth is you bought him because you like them. They have value to you. That's what matters

35:03.440 --> 35:09.240
He says I listened to the double live stream on my last day off and these stats reflect the duration five hours

35:09.400 --> 35:15.700
21 minutes and 18 seconds. That's crazy. That was a long one. I'll be crazy including user lurks a lot

35:15.700 --> 35:17.720
No wonder why we are exhausted when we hit the road

35:17.720 --> 35:23.600
This is I hope you enjoy the sats as much as I enjoyed the show now boo CLI does not support the raw

35:23.920 --> 35:29.520
Linux unplugged RSS feed. Oh, it's like if you just go to our website, really? Yeah, that's embarrassing

35:29.520 --> 35:34.160
Well, it's because we don't generate that. Yeah, it keeps coming up, doesn't it? Yeah, that's the thing for the future

35:34.680 --> 35:35.920
Talk about that in the future

35:35.920 --> 35:42.840
But if you do grab the feed from podcast index, you can put you can point you can point you can point

35:42.840 --> 35:48.400
Boo see like that. I can barely talk. You're trying to get some boost the first place to start podcast index

35:48.640 --> 35:53.200
But so when boo CLI fails it gives you a broken heart emoji as the error message

35:53.680 --> 36:00.740
If that's not a reason to get boo CLI installed. What is lurks a lot came in though with pod verse and Albie to the rescue

36:00.960 --> 36:05.720
He says you sure did tout boo CLI as the leap man's boost a gram which got me to figure it out

36:05.720 --> 36:10.940
It worked for office hours. Okay good it is I honestly if you get boost a gram working

36:10.940 --> 36:15.840
It's sort of like a Littman's test of just like a certain level of technical excellence that you must hold

36:16.080 --> 36:22.640
Yeah, boo CLI requires a domain of knowledge multiple domains of knowledge

36:22.640 --> 36:28.640
So I feel like if you get boo CLI going well, then I we should be sending use it. Yeah, really?

36:28.640 --> 36:29.040
Yeah

36:29.040 --> 36:35.960
we should maybe that's something we should think about actually if people include like a lightning address or something or an invoice and their boost or

36:35.960 --> 36:43.560
Like they're boost for boost lightning URL. We should boost them back some sats if they use boo CLI and thus declare them the master of their

36:43.560 --> 36:45.560
own domain

36:48.600 --> 36:53.440
John a comes in again, is this is this six is this might be six? This is insane

36:53.440 --> 36:59.240
I wonder how long can this be kept up? We need a counter John a says well now I'm just trying to keep my streak alive

36:59.240 --> 37:07.940
Maybe we can get like a JB website subdomain like, you know, yeah a John a streaks

37:07.940 --> 37:13.120
Is it is it broken yet sort of thing, right? That's an interesting idea is John a still a baller.com

37:16.480 --> 37:19.040
Then we just need a little way on github where we can just flip it yes

37:19.040 --> 37:24.000
No, and then the action made that stuff, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I love it. I love it

37:24.000 --> 37:26.400
Thank you, John a for your support also sir looks a lot

37:26.400 --> 37:30.360
We have some more boosts that will be in the show in just a little bit

37:30.360 --> 37:35.480
We really appreciate you guys for supporting us ask not what your podcast can boost for you

37:36.160 --> 37:38.960
But what you can boost for your podcast?

37:40.240 --> 37:44.240
So since we got together last week, we had one last meetup

37:44.240 --> 37:51.140
We had a few things we wanted to chat about but we also have major breaking news on the show

37:51.140 --> 37:56.140
The Pasadena geocache has been located brum brum brum

37:56.620 --> 38:00.500
Tell us Brent. What are the details live on the scene in the studio? What are you learning Brent?

38:02.420 --> 38:04.180
I'm here on locations a little rainy

38:04.180 --> 38:11.500
But I did discover an email this morning that suggested that listener JD found the geocache

38:12.500 --> 38:18.380
They write as luck would have it. I was at a nearby doctor's appointment while listening to Linux. I plugged on Monday morning

38:18.380 --> 38:25.620
Amazing, which is literally the morning it aired the advantages to listening when it's just been published. That's right

38:25.620 --> 38:31.700
I went to the park immediately after and honestly found it in the very first tree. I searched. Okay, that's great

38:31.700 --> 38:34.500
There are a lot of trees in that park. Yeah, and it took you guys

38:35.060 --> 38:40.140
Forever to find it. They give a little bit more information just for our sakes

38:40.140 --> 38:45.380
I'm a recent listener having just started sometime after the JPL signups. Whoa, that's great

38:45.380 --> 38:50.740
Otherwise, I would have loved to have put my name in the hat. I'm new to Linux in general last year

38:50.740 --> 38:56.580
I installed Ubuntu then docker just to run a minecraft server for my son and his friends. Oh, yeah

38:56.580 --> 38:59.660
I've also just started testing paperless NGX. Oh

39:01.260 --> 39:04.500
Thanks for all that you do and feel free to leave more caches in Pasadena

39:04.500 --> 39:07.620
Yeah, we'd had a good time doing that

39:07.620 --> 39:09.620
I think that's something we could do more often because

39:09.940 --> 39:14.260
We could come up with like a perpetual cache to one that's like designed to like have a note

39:14.260 --> 39:17.740
You leave something take something. We could have a special

39:18.460 --> 39:22.100
Matrix room for people who found the cache, you know with the URL

39:23.500 --> 39:28.460
Oh, that's a fun idea see what when you can build your own rooms at willy-nilly styles

39:29.100 --> 39:34.380
You can do all kinds of things. That's great. I am so glad that they found that if you found we have another geocache

39:35.180 --> 39:37.180
we have one in Sacramento and

39:37.180 --> 39:43.900
And there's another oh, yeah, the near grants pass near great in grants pass southern, Oregon area

39:44.500 --> 39:52.220
We also failed to drop one near Portland. I think we meant to yesterday and we had a lot of things

39:52.860 --> 39:58.740
So I may just grab it on my way home and drop it off somewhere in the mountains. Yeah, so we're up there in, Canada

39:59.060 --> 40:02.800
Well, it could be in the US version. We'll see. Oh, no, I say do, Canada

40:02.800 --> 40:06.980
All right, if you can that makes it a cross-border. Oh, I guess the problem is there's nobody up there

40:06.980 --> 40:11.180
Well, the 16 of us can go searching for yeah, it might take a while. Let's get a sealant and syrup

40:11.180 --> 40:14.980
It's a whole thing. Yeah. Yeah, you got it like bait them in. That's how it works

40:15.420 --> 40:20.680
So since our last show we had the Portland meetup, which was our last meetup on our way north

40:20.860 --> 40:27.420
We had we just have never stopped in Portland for a meetup because we're always blasting through to get home and we felt like we owed

40:27.420 --> 40:29.060
this audience

40:29.060 --> 40:34.300
You know a little bit of a get-together, you know for how much we talk about Seattle Portland's a special place

40:34.300 --> 40:39.900
And you know, we gotta treat it right and it's not that far away. So Wes came down like a legend

40:39.900 --> 40:44.460
He showed up during just just like, you know, like like like a like a total boss

40:44.460 --> 40:47.940
He shows up about a half hour after it started. So of course, he has a grand entrance

40:47.940 --> 40:50.380
Every everybody's sitting down. So when Wes comes in

40:59.020 --> 41:00.180
And that was really great

41:00.180 --> 41:03.900
I thought it was a highlight of the night that you made it down and it made it so much fun and then afterwards

41:03.900 --> 41:05.020
um

41:05.020 --> 41:10.620
You got to carpool with or I guess caravan with us for a bit and stay in lady jupes

41:10.620 --> 41:13.620
You got your first night and lady. I know I mean, how long have I known you?

41:13.620 --> 41:17.780
Yeah, and this is my first time I couldn't believe that was your first time. I mean, I've stayed there

41:17.780 --> 41:19.780
What like 40 nights or something?

41:21.820 --> 41:26.140
I'm sorry, you had to be there when the automation systems were down. I just felt very embarrassed about that

41:26.180 --> 41:30.020
It's kind of nice actually because I think the next time you know next time I stay a night there

41:30.020 --> 41:36.540
It's gonna be all the slides will be working. It'll be top-notch. That's true. I have a modern ZigBee setup. You're right

41:36.540 --> 41:40.580
I'll be able yeah. Yeah, that's a good point. I'll be able to top the current one

41:40.580 --> 41:45.180
Whereas if everything was working it would have peaked. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna see a huge improvement

41:45.180 --> 41:49.400
I'm excited for right at least now the pressures on a plus you got a little time with Levi

41:49.400 --> 41:54.220
Oh, yeah, I got some morning snuggles with that cute dog. Yeah, he's a good boy about that

41:54.820 --> 41:57.900
these were great meetups that we went to and the

41:57.900 --> 41:59.900
amazing thing is

42:01.100 --> 42:02.780
every single

42:02.780 --> 42:08.820
location was sourced and ID'd by our audience by our listeners like

42:09.140 --> 42:13.520
Micah, I'm wearing a NASA t-shirt in honor of the occasion the road trip

42:14.180 --> 42:20.780
Very very thoughtful and did you come up with this place if I remember correctly? I did suggest it

42:21.300 --> 42:24.500
I've eaten here before I live about ten blocks away. So

42:24.500 --> 42:29.100
So you just wanted it to be convenient for you. Is that it? Well, it worked, didn't it?

42:29.660 --> 42:32.940
And I noticed you grabbed a bunch of swag and stuff

42:32.940 --> 42:35.980
Is it nice to hang out with a bunch of like-minded people here?

42:35.980 --> 42:39.860
Yeah, it's great because you know, my wife is a very intelligent person

42:39.860 --> 42:44.380
But her eyes glaze over when I start talking about Linux and she wishes I would change the subject

42:44.380 --> 42:48.220
So it's fun to be around people who are interested in this stuff

42:48.220 --> 42:51.100
And is this your first JB meetup?

42:51.100 --> 42:56.540
It is not. I went to Chris's birthday bash in January.

42:58.380 --> 43:02.260
I wanted to be there, but I couldn't be there. How was it? It was great

43:02.260 --> 43:05.780
I thought I was gonna have the record for coming the farthest

43:05.780 --> 43:12.140
But there was actually a listener there from Puerto Rico who happened to be in town on business. So I lost that contest

43:13.420 --> 43:16.500
Of course, well you were second best that's good enough

43:16.500 --> 43:22.700
Yes, it's funny how at these meetups like there's always the okay who came the furthest. Yeah, it's always shocking

43:22.740 --> 43:29.020
It's shocking how far people come for these meetups. You know, that was listener Jose who showed up both in, Colorado

43:29.020 --> 43:34.300
Do you remember that? Yeah, of course here at the studio and I was half expecting him to also show up at one of our meetups

43:34.300 --> 43:37.700
I know I always do now. I always think about Jose. You're always welcome

43:38.220 --> 43:44.060
Yeah, he's always welcome. They're really all great. The Portland one felt really easy

43:44.060 --> 43:48.380
it just felt like just clicking and talking to old friends and there was such a a

43:49.140 --> 43:52.820
broad range of topics at the entire table and

43:53.300 --> 43:57.180
It was a long table. They they gave us basically one end of the building

43:57.180 --> 44:01.500
Which was great because we needed that space and they were very accommodating

44:01.500 --> 44:07.140
All of these breweries were so super chill and so accommodating. Yeah, that's what's nice

44:07.140 --> 44:11.380
It's like you can have a kind of a really mixed group. It's not super crowded. There's a lot of nice space

44:11.380 --> 44:16.300
There's you know, there's non-alcoholic drinks alcoholic drinks different types. There's stuff Brent can have

44:16.300 --> 44:17.820
There's usually a pretty good food menu

44:17.820 --> 44:22.580
Yeah, and just the general general vibe is you know come as you are and hang out for as long as you want

44:22.580 --> 44:26.180
yeah, and just you know make for great conversation and

44:26.660 --> 44:32.060
Listener Nick and listener Joel put some of the best things about these meetups into their own words. That's been great

44:32.060 --> 44:37.140
we've had some wonderful cold beer here from migration brewing and

44:37.140 --> 44:42.580
a lot of good people fun people and it's just good to sit and talk with people about

44:43.460 --> 44:44.820
self-hosting and

44:44.820 --> 44:49.580
Linux and and you know, yeah not get the glossed over stairs

44:49.580 --> 44:55.660
And and so a lot of really good conversation tonight and was that your experience as well?

44:55.980 --> 44:57.980
Yeah, the meetup has been a lot of fun

44:58.060 --> 45:02.740
we've been able to talk about all kinds of topics from Linux related to

45:02.740 --> 45:07.460
You know jogging or running or TV shows or

45:08.100 --> 45:10.100
every everybody's

45:10.180 --> 45:15.220
Familiar with ads and ad blockers and so that's been a common topic as well

45:16.020 --> 45:20.700
For techies and non techies alike. So yeah, there's plenty to talk about. It's been wonderful

45:21.060 --> 45:27.140
Yeah, I agree and at our end of the table we were talking about like no-till farming and all sorts of things

45:27.140 --> 45:29.140
so it's like amazing to me the

45:29.140 --> 45:35.220
breadth of topics that we can just connect on really easily and that's what I find about these meetups is it's just

45:35.500 --> 45:39.900
Great fun and people that you could just become friends with really easily. So thank you both for being here

45:39.900 --> 45:42.480
Yeah, thanks for having us and putting all this together

45:42.500 --> 45:48.100
it's it's been great and it's great to put faces to your guys's voices and and

45:49.220 --> 45:54.260
Get some great swag here from Linode and thank you as well. Thank you

45:54.260 --> 46:00.860
Yeah, it's been great to chat with people all kinds of interesting conversation and like you said putting names to faces. It's been great

46:00.860 --> 46:06.820
Thank you. You know, the real trick is once they see our faces do they keep listening? Yeah, that is we'll find out, right?

46:06.820 --> 46:08.820
I think we have a good shot because

46:09.860 --> 46:11.860
Several of these meetups that we went to

46:12.180 --> 46:15.220
Afterwards there's talk about they want to organize their own event

46:15.220 --> 46:19.980
They want to keep it going even if the JB crew can't be there. They want to be there big meetup energy

46:19.980 --> 46:22.460
Yeah, there is a lot of big meetup energy and I always think man

46:22.460 --> 46:25.180
I just wish we had a website we could tell them to go to and self organize

46:25.180 --> 46:31.780
I want to build a self-hosted meetup site that the audience can use to self-organize. I think they'd use that

46:31.780 --> 46:35.020
I will said there's some cool energy at the meetups as well

46:35.020 --> 46:42.020
Like SUCD at the Portland meetup just gave us some gifts like some weird 3d printed. What would you call them Chris?

46:42.220 --> 46:46.360
Fidget spinners kind of I mean they were really neat though. We sure fidgeted with them

46:46.360 --> 46:49.420
Yeah, the kids are fidgeting with them right now. Yeah, that was really great

46:49.420 --> 46:54.580
And other folks brought other gifts at the other meetups. So everyone who gave us all sorts of things. Thank you very much

46:54.780 --> 46:58.460
Yeah, very nice audience. So generous. So nice. So too good too good

46:58.700 --> 47:02.900
We should probably just fold in fold the cards close up shop and it right now

47:03.260 --> 47:06.780
Ended on a high note because I mean just always so nice when you go see these people

47:06.780 --> 47:09.780
How could it ever be any better? How could you ask for anything more when you're doing these shows?

47:09.780 --> 47:15.120
I was chatting with someone at the Portland meetup and they put they put a nice contrast on it

47:15.120 --> 47:19.000
This gentleman went to a fair number of regular sort of tech meetups

47:19.000 --> 47:22.680
I think you know did sort of DevOps things professionally which many, you know

47:22.680 --> 47:25.460
Many of our audience or developers or do full-time tech stuff

47:26.120 --> 47:32.880
But that's really all you get at those sort of tech, you know, right focused meetups and a lot of these JB meetups

47:32.880 --> 47:37.060
It's it's just such a nice mix of people who do it for work. Yeah, but

47:37.720 --> 47:42.440
Not the people who only do it for work occasionally, but it's it's enthusiast, right?

47:42.440 --> 47:46.480
And it can be like you're just doing home automation at home a lot of self strong self-hosted showing

47:46.480 --> 47:48.320
I think in Portland or you know

47:48.320 --> 47:52.320
You just like this stuff at work and you want to learn you you're so interested like I think you know

47:52.320 --> 47:54.520
We have been that you just want more of it

47:54.680 --> 47:59.280
So it's an interesting thing because you know Brent had a chance to chat with a few people and I was listening back to the audio

47:59.280 --> 48:02.660
This morning and just based on the conversations I had had to

48:03.840 --> 48:08.720
Yeah, not everybody is doing Linux as their day job that comes to these meetups and some of them

48:08.720 --> 48:14.200
They're just people who like to geek out and go deep into topics and Linux is one of the topics

48:14.200 --> 48:16.600
They're going deep into and I think they're just looking for content

48:16.880 --> 48:21.480
That has you know high production standards that they want to listen to that digs into this kind of stuff

48:21.480 --> 48:23.480
and so they begin to build a

48:23.640 --> 48:29.320
whole set of knowledge around this topic by listening to the show and then by checking out the things we talked about because they're

48:29.320 --> 48:33.240
Just intellectually curious and then they take it to the next level and actually go to these meetups

48:33.240 --> 48:36.520
And I think these people are better than me because I just don't think I'd ever take it to that next level

48:36.520 --> 48:41.640
But they do two things. I love about that is one. Yeah, right that they can take it to levels

48:41.640 --> 48:48.440
I don't have because I think there's a there's an enthusiasm that sometimes you know the professionals you get a bit tired and jaded

48:50.320 --> 48:53.960
Stuff when you gotta make it work and you have to get up at 9 a.m. And like do the thing

48:54.080 --> 48:58.920
But like when it's when it's the when it's your release when it's a something you're genuinely excited about

48:59.440 --> 49:03.200
It's good to have that energy. Yeah, and then the other part is once you've got the Linux bridge

49:03.200 --> 49:06.960
Yeah, like for folks with so many different backgrounds. It's a chance for us to really learn a lot

49:07.200 --> 49:13.400
Although I got to say some of my favorite conversations are the jaded professionals that have like, you know what I'm talking about

49:13.400 --> 49:19.920
Those are great conversations. We always we always have a good chuckle with those ones too because yeah, we know we've been there

49:19.920 --> 49:21.920
We feel we're part of that set. Yeah, I

49:22.760 --> 49:28.660
Think it's probably also important to note that West the only reason you and I are here from from a bunch of JB meetups

49:28.760 --> 49:30.760
It's right. Oh weird, right

49:30.760 --> 49:38.760
Yeah, the meetups are us and we are in the meetups. Whoa, we are made on the meetups the drop. Yeah, it's crazy

49:39.040 --> 49:43.800
Thank you to Linode too. If you're thinking about getting some hosting seriously, check out Linode, you know

49:43.800 --> 49:46.880
They they invest in these kind of meetups so that way our community can connect

49:47.480 --> 49:54.180
Professionals can talk to other professionals. They can network. I overheard people, you know exchanging details for jobs for you know

49:54.180 --> 49:57.880
Contact us for getting a job like that kind of stuff was going down Linode, you know

49:57.880 --> 50:05.280
They're investing long-term in the community and that I think is a particularly keen insight into how they think about this stuff

50:05.280 --> 50:07.560
and how they try to support it at a real like

50:08.320 --> 50:14.720
Grassroots level so Linode comm slash unplugged. Yeah, we had plenty of tech failures, but none of that was Linode's fault

50:14.720 --> 50:16.720
I don't know the stuff we hosted on the node that just works

50:19.720 --> 50:23.680
Bit warden comm slash Linux bit warden is my password manager

50:23.680 --> 50:30.960
It's West's password manager and they have been just going at full speed. They recently announced fast mail email alias integration

50:31.120 --> 50:38.320
They have great new features for your vault a browser extension that has been turned up to I'm gonna say 13 not even 11 and

50:39.240 --> 50:42.480
They've even been giving love to their command-line interface. Yeah bit warden

50:42.480 --> 50:44.540
I don't talk about it, but they have a command-line interface as well

50:44.540 --> 50:46.040
They have a flat pack app too

50:46.040 --> 50:52.660
Which is like the first thing I install now on my genome desktop and bit warden wants to remind everyone that October is cyber security

50:52.660 --> 50:59.860
Awareness month. So this is something just as a moment as just say, you know, if you've been trying to bring up that conversation

50:59.860 --> 51:02.340
This is something you can do to kind of put your foot in the door

51:02.340 --> 51:07.780
It's cyber security awareness month and using a strong password is like number one with a bullet

51:07.780 --> 51:11.780
Which you can do to protect yourself online and bit warden can generate and store strong passwords for you

51:11.780 --> 51:17.460
it's easy to enable multi-factor authentication. It's also recommended you keep your software up to date and

51:17.460 --> 51:23.000
Honestly, you should be aware if your passwords are being used online and watch out for phishing as well

51:23.100 --> 51:25.100
These are all things along with a great password

51:25.820 --> 51:30.060
Keeping your credentials unique across your websites and your services. You can do to really protect yourself online

51:30.940 --> 51:37.340
As bit warden would like to tell you and I would like to remind you there's really nothing better you can do than just having

51:37.340 --> 51:42.700
A great place to store your secrets and share them privately and securely because these are things you're gonna have to have

51:42.700 --> 51:45.300
You're gonna have logins. You're gonna have two-factor codes

51:45.300 --> 51:51.780
You're gonna have secret information like passphrases or maybe bank account information those types of things for families

51:52.500 --> 51:56.200
Bit warden can be the place to store that you're gonna have that kind of information just happens. It's life

51:57.460 --> 52:02.540
And multi-factor authentication is a great way to add a little extra security to your accounts there, too

52:02.540 --> 52:06.340
And enabling two-step login on bit warden improves the security of your password vault

52:06.420 --> 52:11.220
You've got options like verification through email or authenticator app or Fido to our Yubikey

52:11.220 --> 52:18.660
You could also do that and premium subscribers can also have bit warden generate time-based one-time password authentication codes for your accounts

52:18.660 --> 52:20.380
Which adds a little bit of strength there, doesn't it?

52:20.380 --> 52:26.120
All of this added together makes bit warden a fantastic and incredible maybe even the best I'd say tool

52:26.660 --> 52:32.700
To protect yourself online bit warden support security for all with fully featured free accounts available to everyone as well

52:33.020 --> 52:40.360
So this cyber security awareness month protect yourself and help protect the loved ones around you your friends your family by educating them on password security

52:40.360 --> 52:46.120
They probably already think of you as the tech person. They know this is a great opportunity to use that influence for good

52:46.480 --> 52:48.480
And send them to bit warden.com

52:48.960 --> 52:56.520
Slash Linux go get started with a free trial for teams or an individual plan right now at bit warden.com slash Linux

52:59.880 --> 53:01.600
As always we got some great feedback

53:01.600 --> 53:07.380
Thank you everyone for sending that in Paul wrote in and writes I want to thank you for introducing me to silver blue

53:07.380 --> 53:13.280
For the first time I don't want to throw my ancient HP stream laptop into the trash every time I use it

53:13.620 --> 53:18.400
This distro seems to run crazy fast compared to kabuntu running on the exact same system

53:18.400 --> 53:21.980
And it's not nearly as glitchy with the suspend and resume

53:22.580 --> 53:28.260
It's the first time I've used redhat and fedora anything and so far. I gotta say I'm impressed

53:29.140 --> 53:33.280
hmm, you know, I didn't say which version of kabuntu he was

53:33.280 --> 53:39.080
Switching from but some of this I don't know. What do you think West but couldn't some of this just be explained by a new

53:39.080 --> 53:40.000
colonel

53:40.000 --> 53:44.760
Well a new colonel is always a nice upgrade. Yeah, I mean especially you're talking like like a big jump

53:44.760 --> 53:50.400
Yeah performance improvements sleep suspend improvements. There also could be something about Wayland

53:50.400 --> 53:54.860
I notice a general smoothness with Wayland that I don't get on x11

53:54.860 --> 54:00.680
So if you're coming from kabuntu using X you go over to your silver blues using the Wayland's

54:00.680 --> 54:03.000
It's gonna be a smooth experience there, too

54:03.000 --> 54:04.820
And I don't even know if we need a dissect it

54:04.820 --> 54:07.880
I think we can just be happy like people live in that silver blue lifestyle

54:07.880 --> 54:12.920
Like it's true right like silver blue works for people. It's not a you might expect sort of the reverse, right?

54:12.920 --> 54:16.560
You're like, oh, well, I did silver blue it all of these weird exceptions. I had to figure out

54:16.560 --> 54:20.240
That's not what Paul's writing it about. No, you know what the kids say. They say glow on

54:21.000 --> 54:23.680
Glow on and they're really into a mutability

54:24.320 --> 54:28.480
Ian has a pretty close to home request here for meetups

54:28.480 --> 54:35.360
Ian writes when is JB coming to the East Coast like East Coast of Canada surely, you know

54:35.360 --> 54:42.440
There's a big audience here in Toronto a big audience in Toronto. You say well, I believe that leads us right in teleboosts

54:44.160 --> 54:49.760
And now it is time for the boost Sam's quanch boosts in with

54:51.760 --> 54:53.760
16,180

54:53.760 --> 54:58.320
You guys ever plan to come up to BC for stuff

54:58.320 --> 55:02.480
I mean Vancouver and Victoria are pretty large tech communities these days

55:03.280 --> 55:07.040
Thanks and keep up the great work. Also Sam's quanch here reveals that

55:07.840 --> 55:10.840
16180 first five digits of the golden ratio nice

55:12.640 --> 55:17.480
But I think here we have to defer to our local Canadian, right I think we should well

55:17.480 --> 55:21.440
I think one thing that's fascinating about where we're sitting exactly right now geographically is

55:21.440 --> 55:27.760
Sam's quanch here says when you're coming up to Victoria and it turns out it's kind of at the same latitude

55:27.760 --> 55:32.360
I think so that's a fascinating thing about Canada. There's one tip for you

55:35.520 --> 55:40.480
Mention maple syrup. Yeah, I would actually love to see a Canadian road trip

55:40.480 --> 55:46.840
Although I feel like that's maybe a little bit more of a dedication than what we just did on the west coast here

55:46.840 --> 55:51.800
But certainly there are a few locations that would be great to do a small little thing Chris

55:52.280 --> 55:57.680
Vancouver's not even that far for you. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely want to make it up there gosh

55:57.680 --> 55:58.920
I mean

55:58.920 --> 56:03.960
It's hard to talk about it right now when I'm feeling like I never want to do another road trip for the rest of my life

56:03.960 --> 56:07.200
And I live in an RV. So that really tells you how hard it was

56:08.040 --> 56:10.800
Earlier you said you didn't want to do an American road trip. Oh

56:12.040 --> 56:15.640
Right. No, actually I really would like to do it. I wonder I know

56:15.640 --> 56:19.040
There is a season of life that I am in now

56:19.480 --> 56:24.520
where it is really hard to travel and so I just kind of like cram it in there like a maniac and then just sort

56:24.520 --> 56:25.760
of like

56:25.760 --> 56:32.100
Chaos ensues hate yourself a little. Yeah, but I feel like there will be a season of life

56:32.640 --> 56:38.920
Where dad is not as interesting and then maybe dad will travel more, you know, I'm saying I'm not saying I'm your dad

56:38.920 --> 56:41.600
I'm saying I'm literally my kid's dad, you know get right you get where I'm going with this

56:41.600 --> 56:45.800
And so maybe I'll travel more, but I don't want to wait that long at the same time. So

56:46.880 --> 56:48.480
Well, I'll just you know what?

56:48.480 --> 56:50.240
This is just the booster is listening now

56:50.240 --> 56:56.940
So I'll get into it if you are in a city that has a venue that would be willing to host a couple of crazy

56:57.240 --> 57:01.520
Podcasters and host, you know 30 40 60 of our closest friends

57:01.880 --> 57:08.160
Get in contact with us if we could start finding venues in these areas where when we get there we can produce a show

57:08.360 --> 57:10.360
because I'll tell you what happens friends is

57:10.360 --> 57:16.600
We kill ourselves get into these places holding these meetups doing the driving and then we don't have any show afterwards

57:16.600 --> 57:19.880
We don't actually record a show there and then you didn't because you're driving

57:19.880 --> 57:24.300
It's hard to find the time to do the work to figure out the plan the show

57:24.300 --> 57:27.220
Yeah, we're doing seven-hour drive days. Then we're prepping for a show

57:27.220 --> 57:30.000
Then I'm waking up at six in the morning four in the morning

57:30.000 --> 57:34.840
Whatever it is to drive or do a show and I'm either driving or I'm doing a show and I just realized that's crazy

57:34.840 --> 57:41.040
So instead let's go to a location. We'll do a show there. We'll do it live and you know

57:41.040 --> 57:44.860
Maybe moderate like ticket something cheap something that's affordable

57:44.860 --> 57:47.640
But maybe we could pay for our tickets to fly in or something like that

57:48.120 --> 57:52.540
So if you're in an area like Vancouver or I don't care, Ohio

57:52.540 --> 57:58.440
I don't care if you got a venue they got food I can eat and they can host some of our friends and the three

57:58.440 --> 58:04.600
Of us they're willing to watch some buffoons make a podcast in real time. Let us know Chris at Jupiter broadcasting calm

58:04.600 --> 58:07.320
We're better yet. If you really want me to see it boost it in. Oh

58:08.140 --> 58:12.480
Speaking of boosts a young dookie boosts in with four thousand and forty eight sets

58:13.480 --> 58:18.720
I wanted to point out three projects that helped me mapping location searches on

58:19.440 --> 58:22.520
Android I use an app called a castus photon

58:22.640 --> 58:28.280
Which you can use to search for points of interest and then it lets you open the result in whatever your map or navigation tool

58:28.280 --> 58:33.120
Of choice by default it uses the photon project public instance

58:33.120 --> 58:39.040
But can be self-hosted. Ah, alternatively you can use the polis project polis.io

58:39.280 --> 58:44.280
Which which can also be self-hosted via g code earth safe travels

58:44.600 --> 58:51.640
So the mapping situation on Android is an interesting one. I've been running graphing since the road trip was like a

58:52.760 --> 59:00.080
Weekend to the road trip. I started using graphing and I quickly realized that I still was I kind of ended up needing to use

59:00.080 --> 59:04.880
Google Maps, but this is not a lot of great mapping options when you really are like

59:05.440 --> 59:07.480
Really depending on this thing

59:07.480 --> 59:09.480
like I need because I also I

59:09.720 --> 59:14.920
Need satellite images to check out gas stations to see if they can fit tubes to make sure I can get in and out

59:15.240 --> 59:18.960
And man Google makes that really crazy easy. And if you don't have Apple Maps

59:19.640 --> 59:24.480
Which I didn't done graph, you know us I kind of ended up falling back to Google Maps, which kind of stunk

59:24.840 --> 59:29.280
I'm sure I could figure out a better solution. I'd love to hear what people do for like the satellite images

59:29.280 --> 59:33.000
I don't necessarily need it for navigation, but I needed to review an area

59:33.000 --> 59:36.560
I need to be able to plug in an address or GPS coordinates, you know to me

59:37.360 --> 59:41.160
Let me know Michael B. Boos in with 3000 cents

59:42.800 --> 59:47.880
Chris I would love to hear which of the GNOME workflows you learned

59:48.360 --> 59:51.440
GNOME workflows have been a very popular topic on

59:52.480 --> 59:54.480
Like just I don't know every

59:54.480 --> 59:59.320
Morning or every like constantly Brenner talking about this because he's been trying out pop OS

59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.840
You're trying to get him to fundamentally change how he uses a computer. That's true. And

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.720
So workflows have been coming up a lot

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:10.000
I'll tell you here's a real quick rundown of how I've used GNOME and I found it really effective

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.520
It's very first thing I did around the GNOME 312 era

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:18.640
But I think you could do it anytime is I just decided to spend a month each day

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.880
Or each week or whatever I needed at the time learning the GNOME way of doing things

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:27.600
So I just decided well if GNOME doesn't want me to use minimize and maximize

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:29.760
I'll try without that for a bit

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.120
I didn't always stick with it like that one I I didn't stick with

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:38.000
but some of them I did and one of the things I adopted that I find to be pretty effective on GNOME especially now with

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.800
Horizontal or workspaces on laptops is I full screen a couple of apps

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.680
But I do that thing where I put two apps together

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.440
So maybe like one screen will be element

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:54.120
It'll be big and wide and then I'll have like a small version of telegram on that same desktop

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.280
And that is always desktop too. And then I I use an extension

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.600
I think it's called like auto window or something like that or there's an extension that will automatically

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:09.200
We'll find it for the show notes right Wes. Oh surely. Yeah, sure that automatically opens applications on specific workspaces

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:15.360
So desktop one is always my web browsers desktop two is always my primary chat applications

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:21.520
desktop three is gonna be steam and desktop four is usually just like a catch-all where I just put all kinds of stuff on there and

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:27.200
The console kind of just floats between the desktops where I need a console. I also have a drop-down console

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.000
I think it's called D term

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.840
But there's a few options that I like a lot and I combine all of that

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.600
Along with a couple of essential extensions like I like to see a workspace indicator

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:42.080
I like to have a few more system tray icons than you get by default. So I combine all that together

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:47.640
Auto move windows you already found it and it is in the show notes and that will automatically put

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:52.760
Certain windows and certain virtual desktop spaces and I find that to be an essential way to use

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:58.120
GNOME and Chris do you use a different workflow depending on whether you have three monitors or not?

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:04.160
More or less mostly with GNOME if I have a if I have multiple monitors I leave

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:11.020
The external monitors on a static workspace and I just switch the main monitor workspace most the time

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.020
not always

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:14.780
most of the time

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.780
We got a boost in from user

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.900
6475 just 64 humble sets

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:26.020
B-o-o-s-t coming in with my little fountain FM boost. I wanted to say thank you and keep up the great show

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.180
I'm curious though

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:34.100
Are there fewer emails to read on the show because people have moved to boosting or have those been getting put to the side?

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.780
Podcasting to know seems like a great way to support creators

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:42.340
But I don't want to see those who haven't come over being left behind kind of like the boosts

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:45.860
and we do the same thing with emails where we select for content and

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:50.660
There's definitely been less emails now that there's more boosts

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:57.500
But you also get more boosts because the lengths are shorter than probably 80% of the emails that we get

01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:58.060
Yeah

01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.220
It makes them very easy to select them because they're already

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:03.860
Essentially cut for the show and so you can get to more of them as well

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:09.780
But there has been a shift which has been interesting also seeing that on Kota radio not a huge shift not like a ginormous

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.900
shift but a noticeable difference as

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:17.500
And that's fine in a lot of ways. These are easy to process too. So that works for us

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:24.300
What I've noticed is actually the emails tend to be the long-form ideas that are sort of deep dives

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:30.860
if you will and the boost seems to be the place where all the the quick ideas or the just quick questions come in and

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:36.220
They're not lesser either way, but they've just evolved. I think yeah different things

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:40.300
And kind of what but each is best for I suppose

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:47.540
Cyprus boosted in with 1200 sats. Hey guys, have you thought of doing an osint? I guess that's like a

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:56.580
Open source intelligence episode. I've only just discovered a Loki net which looks like Tor but seems to use blockchain behind it

01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:01.340
So I went and looked at Loki net have either one of you guys seen this? No. Oh, man

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.340
I don't know if this is anything actually worth totally trusting

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:09.780
But they sure make a cool-looking website totally like know their demo is

01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:16.220
Oh, I better check that but when you scroll down look at that black hole animation they have on there

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:21.220
That's how you know, it must be high-quality software. It's got a black hole animation. You see that? Okay

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:27.420
It is it does seem to be GPL 3. Yeah, I actually I mean I joke but here's what they pitch

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:34.700
Decentralized network onion routed traffic and no IP address looking at hides your IP that you're connecting from and to

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:41.980
Your location and identity are unknown. All traffic is onion routed. Your browsing is private secure and anonymous

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:48.940
L-ok I net org if you want to check it out. Yeah, they do seem to have a fairly extensive FAQ there

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:54.580
I kind of I kind of minute. I actually kind of interested you started talking blockchain for this kind of thing

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.780
And I'm a little skeptical

01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:02.780
Blockchain hasn't been great for much other than as a distributed ledger for Bitcoin

01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:08.780
Maybe we'll see something else. I'm kind of impressed by hive. So maybe they're on to something

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:14.140
We shall see if you guys want to check it out. I'd be down if anybody actually let's start with this

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:21.740
If you've tried Loki net let us know give us your first impressions your thoughts and if you get us interested

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:24.780
Maybe we'll check it out. Yeah. Why is it worth spending time on? Yeah

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:29.340
Why that over tour because tour seems like it's got the network effect, but maybe I'm wrong on this kind of thing

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:33.340
But I don't have cool graphics. Oh, yeah tour doesn't have a black hole do they Wes?

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:39.140
I'm not that not last I checked I hadn't checked today. So yeah, we'll have to check back. Maybe they will

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:43.780
So true grits boosts in with the traditional Trek boost

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.580
So I had been asking

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:50.980
just to get an update on how far behind people tend to fall from time to time and then they're

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:56.300
They've been boosting in to let us know and true grit says I got about a month behind on all the podcast

01:05:56.300 --> 01:06:01.260
But I'm glad to say I'm officially caught up now and thanks for the exclusive member feed bonus last week

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:04.460
Well, you're welcome. Yeah, we didn't have a traditional live show

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:11.260
but we had something we want to turn around for the audience because you know what we love our members and so we wanted to

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:17.420
Get them something even if we weren't live and we have a boost from bronzewing this week 9001 sats over 9000

01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:27.380
Okay, so this is really awesome we mentioned that JPL used to use Solaris well bronzewing writes in

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:34.380
that the shadow UAV the drone that the US Army uses is currently in its second version and

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:43.380
The first version didn't use rail use Solaris, but the second version of the shadow UAV is running rail

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:49.380
They run rail on the stations to control it and they run Red Hat Enterprise Linux on the actual drone

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:53.380
Wow that the US Army uses that's pretty wild

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:59.380
Also bronze we wanted to say that fountain FM now has carplay support nice update

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:04.380
And so he can now earn sats while he drives glad you guys had a great time at JPL

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:09.380
Hoping maybe you guys can swing by Boise sometime. Thanks for the show boost you later

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:15.380
Yeah, we got to get to Eastern Washington. We got to get to Boise little Spokane Boise. Yeah, that'd be fun

01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:17.380
Yeah, I'm not taking the RV though

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.380
Parking that thing

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:25.380
Never do another road trip again. Oh, yeah, just a car caravan this time. Yeah, why not? Why not? It's a race you say

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.380
I love a race. So let's go

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:32.380
But I mean that sounds a lot of fun. But no actually one day we'll road trip again

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.380
But in the meantime, I'm taking a break

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:38.380
Soltros boosted in with 11,000 sets

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.380
The coolest thing about stadia was its portability

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:50.380
I have a really nice gaming rig with Ryzen 5600 X a ton of RAM and an RTX 3060

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:56.380
But I also enjoyed gaming like destiny 2 on my phone. Oh destiny 2 is a great game

01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:03.380
I know it had its issues, but it was just so ahead technologically compared to things like Amazon Luna Xbox xCloud

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:08.380
Etc. It's a shame to see it go. I agree. It was technically better

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:13.380
So for example, the NVIDIA GeForce streaming stuff is pretty great for a Linux user

01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:15.380
Because you can import your Steam library

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:21.380
So if you bought a game on Steam, you can stream it on GeForce. Now stadia didn't get that stadia

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:24.380
You had to buy the game, but it was like a headless game

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:30.380
You would hit play and it would launch you like way into the game into like the menu of the game

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:33.380
But on things like GeForce now

01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:41.380
You actually like remote desktoping into a Windows virtual desktop is renting yourself like a temporary Windows VM to game on and then it starts

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:46.380
Steam.exe and you sign into your Steam account including like you got to go do the two-factor stuff

01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:52.380
And then like it's got to like super fast download the game which works pretty good because they got fast internet connections

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:56.380
But it downloads the game and installs it on the Windows VM then launches the game

01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:59.380
And then you're playing the game and you go through the first time setup for all the game stuff

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:03.380
And while it detects your hardware right stadia didn't have any of that. I

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.380
Talk about like it's already gone

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:10.380
Marcel wrote in with 3000 sets

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.380
stadia is a self-fulfilling prophecy

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:21.380
Everyone knew Google would cancel it at some point just like they cancel everything. So nobody used it. So Google had to cancel it

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:25.380
It can't be Linux's fault alone the stadia failed

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:31.380
It's the old-school thinking of game publishers even a Windows VM would trip up anti-cheat

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:39.380
They were referring to Marcel's referring to the verge kind of pin some of this on the fact that you had to target Linux and Vulcan

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:43.380
Which is funny because I'm sure the same verge would be happy to run a piece about what a hit the deck is

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:48.380
Just so backwards for 12 Linux boosted in with

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:59.380
What do you call that two megs of sats?

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:01.380
Thanks for the shootout last week

01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:07.380
I didn't purchase a stadia because I didn't trust Google to keep the service operational and leave me hung up to dry

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:11.380
When money is tight, it's hard to gamble on these types of devices

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:15.380
Perhaps if they stayed at launch they would keep it operational for a certain number of years

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:20.380
The reception would have been a bit better. Thanks for the quality content and great job everyone

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:23.380
So this makes me wonder I have a question for both of you

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:28.380
What does Google have to do in the future now to get you to think their next product? They're going to launch

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:34.380
Maybe it has a subscription. Maybe it doesn't what do they have to do to convince you to actually try it would something

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:41.380
Like a minimum years like 412 Linux is suggesting like we guarantee this will exist for five years

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:48.380
Would that get you to try it or is that ship sailed because of the privacy concerns like what?

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:53.380
What does Google have to do comprehensively to get you to trust their next product boy?

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:58.380
I mean on the face of it that sort of guarantee sounds nice, but can you really trust that guarantee?

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:02.380
You know like there's the question of that because like four years in they're just like wow

01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:07.380
I know we said that we're gonna do the same thing where we refund you so we're not really like breaking our promise in that way

01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:15.380
Yeah, I think I'd need to hear you know, I mean if they just had a product that legitimately went well and that I wasn't interested in

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:19.380
But there was like, you know, I would could get over that hump to the next phase that could do it barring that

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:25.380
I feel like I I would want to either understand how it was connected to their sort of core ad business

01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:31.380
That could maybe justify like okay if I can understand how this is like directly in that bottom line then like a type of transparency almost

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:37.380
Yeah, maybe I could understand like do they have strong incentives to keep it working because it is part of their business

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:44.380
Otherwise, I think I'd want to hear more from ex Googlers or like some more of the culture

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:50.380
Because we just hear so much about like how segmented everything is sometimes internally how there's this sort of like

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:57.380
Launch a product to get promoted and then you know, you move off that team and go do some other things until that changes

01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:02.380
Are there some kind of inkling that they have more of an overall holistic organizational focus?

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:07.380
I don't be hard to trust anything Brett. What if they guaranteed that?

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:15.380
Everything they do for this product if they ever shut it down will be GPL. Does that change the calculus for you?

01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:22.380
This is such a hard question. I think I think that would at least get me really looking but then it becomes almost like

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:29.380
Very different than everything else they've done. So is it just a new business is interesting question. I feel like

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:37.380
Surely there are certainly some wonderfully intelligent people working there who are just like us and like the people who showed up at our meetups

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:43.380
And I want to get to know those people but Google as a huge massive business

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:49.380
Has always tripped me up and I've I don't I actually don't think they can really do anything

01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:56.380
Get me signed up. I wonder if that's how I'm wondering if that's that's how most the audience is feeling to let us know what you think out there

01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:00.380
What would Google have to do or could they do anything to convince you?

01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:01.380
And I mean think about it

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:09.380
Like if there was some sort of transparency approach like Wes is talking about and some sort of commitment to a time and maybe a release of code

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:12.380
Maybe transparency on privacy. What would it take?

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:18.380
Let us know boostin or linuxunplug.com slash contact because I'm wondering if it's just they're too far gone as a brand

01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:22.380
Could you imagine if they released stadia's source code just be like, oh we're shutting it down

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:26.380
But you guys can well the issue is and I'm wondering I'd like to hear somebody address this is

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:29.380
How do you solve the infrastructure aspect of something like that?

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:35.380
I like I mean the only way I can think of it is if they had some sort of portable self-hostable version of stadia that they let you download or something as a talker container

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:39.380
But the pie can't do it. Yeah, right

01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:46.380
I mean, that's just I'm wondering I'd love to hear the audience feedback on that one. We got a thousand stats from happy listener

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:53.380
I thought y'all should get a boost for recognizing the fact that you maintained a really high audio quality standard even went on the road

01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:58.380
I'm impressed. Oh, you should see what we had to do to make that possible

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:05.380
I don't know. We want to admit on air. We might get in trouble by Airbnb, but we had to make modifications temporary modifications

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:08.380
But I'll just say this turns out beds

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:14.380
Mattresses sheets blankets. They all make for good temporary sound 60 pillows too is yeah

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:18.380
What are you more useful for podcast any of what you usually use it for?

01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:20.380
I wanted to say to happy listener

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:23.380
Thank you for recognizing that kind of value and then returning that value to the show

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:26.380
That's exactly the kind of value for value exchange

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:29.380
We're talking about or like how listeners that helped us source great locations

01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.380
For breweries or listeners that show up to the mumble room or participate in the community

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:36.380
Those are types of a value for value exchange that we also really appreciate

01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:40.380
So when you recognize something you appreciate we appreciate about the shows and you boost in to recognize it

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:45.380
It means a lot to us. Also. I think we should give a special shout out to our editor drew

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:48.380
Who did extra work to make sure that we sounded as best as possible?

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:52.380
No matter what we throw at him. Yeah, and also when we had technical difficulties

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:58.380
That meant that we recorded what like three hours later than we were expecting right still got through it, right?

01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:02.380
That is very true. That really was pretty flexible and pretty awesome of drew

01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:08.380
So thank you to drew for making it sound as good as it possibly could too and then last boost of the show goes to

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.380
Mr. Rustic cast of Versa

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:15.380
Comes in with a thousand sats

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:22.380
I've been a listener of JB for a decade. You spoiled my ears with amazing audio quality. Stop it you guys. Oh my gosh

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:26.380
JB is the best in the biz when it comes to high quality consistent audio

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:32.380
I hope to try out RoboSats soon the reason I actually included this boost right here. I hope to try out RoboSats soon

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:37.380
And I hope to have time to spend in the matrix channel and have someone hold my hand as well

01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:40.380
lol RoboSats is a great way to get

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:46.380
Anonymous Bitcoin really simply through a system that I think is a great experience and

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:51.380
See, I was hoping I could buy robots with sats. You could probably one day probably

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:54.380
I mean, I don't know how you do us could try it

01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:57.380
And I do have a few thank yous out there

01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:02.380
We got 2600 sats from grounded grid suggesting that we try out software to find radio

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:05.380
We heard that at the meetups too. So something will be playing around with

01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:11.380
10,000 sats from Deleted who is testing out his new breeze install because he don't want to switch podcast apps

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:14.380
We got a 500 sats from DM Marowski

01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:21.380
Not sure about that. I don't think so the Marowski. All right with their first boost and a shout out to real maple syrup

01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:27.380
Yeah, one of your brethren. Uh-huh one of 16 good and we got a thousand sats from couch Fox

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:33.380
Which is a great username who is a member and also boosted in and would like to have the member feed boostable

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:38.380
We do have member feed upgrade scheduled as one of our next projects and then bend

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:44.380
I boosted in with leet sat saying they're also looking forward to those member feed upgrades. Okay, okay got we got it

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:50.380
We got no bad coder or nomadic order five boosted in 557 sats. Just great to see you guys in Pasadena

01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:53.380
Cheers, sir. That was so much fun

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:54.380
It was yeah

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:59.380
If you'd like to support the show get a new podcast app and get all the new podcasting features like chapters

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:07.380
Host info sat streaming search and boosts. Well, then you need a new podcast app new podcast apps comm go get a podcasting

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:11.380
2.0 compatible app or if you want to nerd out and go with boost CLI

01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:18.380
You absolutely can and if you don't want to switch apps Albee alby something worth checking out and so is breeze

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:20.380
be our easy

01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:25.380
Technology if you're interested in more of our back that behind the scenes adventures

01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:31.380
Office hours this week is gonna have some pretty juicy content. I think we ran into let's just say a

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:38.380
Few little issues and so stay tuned for that one office hours 14 coming up and also

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:43.380
we'd love to hear from you if you have any ideas on how we might have done the trip a little differently or

01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:46.380
Ideas on maybe a pic since we're missing one this week

01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:53.380
Please hit us up Linux unplug comm slash contact. Yes, and it's a pics. Let's get some audience pics coming in

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:58.380
I like that. Remember if it's a certain language then it gets a standpoint clip

01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:03.380
You're invited to hang out with us for the live stream as well. We do it every single Sunday

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:08.380
We and we don't have technical issues at Jupiter tube at noon Pacific 3 p.m

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:14.380
Eastern generally, but we'll convert it to your local time at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.380
if you're in the industry

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:19.380
you owe it to yourself to check out Linux action news or if you just want to

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:25.380
Stay apprised of all the things going on in the world of Linux and open source that really impact the industry Linux action news

01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:31.380
Comm it's really a companion to this show wouldn't you say? Oh, yeah, I would say I mean we're on it

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:35.380
So we might be biased. No, I think so, too. Yeah. Okay Brent's not on the show

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:41.380
We can't fit all the news in this show because we have like, you know stuff to talk about projects to update

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:44.380
Ridiculous servers to update live on the show

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:50.880
The news goes in the section is that's right links to everything we talked about today. Well, that's over at Linux unplugged comm slash

01:18:50.880 --> 01:19:17.880
479 thanks for joining us. We'll see you right back here next Sunday

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.880
I

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.080
Have a little update that I think I should probably share well ain't honest

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.720
Well, as you know Chris intimately, I've been using the dev one the whole trip

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.080
Yeah

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:47.640
And we decided to leave my x250 here at the studio a big moment

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.120
The trusty ThinkPad was left behind for the newly deployed

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.880
dev one with

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:57.280
Cosmic not with plasma and I you know

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:00.320
Despite some listeners at some of the meetups trying to convince me

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:06.880
Otherwise I did stick with cosmic the whole time you did I did and I even resisted adding

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:09.640
13 extensions to make it look like Chris's setups

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.840
Yeah, I kept trying to tempt you

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:20.120
but I'm curious did you stick with it because you were committed to sticking with cosmic or did you stick with it because

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:27.760
The schedule was so unrelenting. We didn't even get five minutes to install packages. Let alone switch a desktop environment

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.160
Yeah, you know I

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:33.200
It's both. I certainly haven't updated since we left the studio

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:37.360
So I feel like yeah

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:42.840
The schedule was tricky in the sense that we were just moving constantly at every hour of the day

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.280
But now that we're stead now that we're staying put now that we're now that we're in the studio

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.280
What happens next this plasma go on there? Well, I don't know

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:55.000
I feel like maybe you know, we've got what an hour before our dinners ready

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
I feel like we can come up with something more adventurous

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:05.880
And I just want to take a nap
