00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
You guys follow Lifehacker right? Hey Noah's in studio by the way. Hello. Hey you follow Lifehacker right?

00:05.760 --> 00:09.180
Did you know that they do these Linux packs? Have you seen these these here Linux packs?

00:09.180 --> 00:14.040
No. Yeah, they do these Linux packs of every year and Winston Gordon did one this year

00:14.040 --> 00:16.440
And I wanted to go through a couple of the apps with you guys

00:16.880 --> 00:21.000
And I think some of them have been app picks on the last but not all of them

00:21.000 --> 00:26.360
So I thought maybe we'd go through a couple of them and see what we thought and then it's you know

00:26.360 --> 00:27.400
It's like pre-show stuff

00:27.400 --> 00:29.920
I don't think it's main show stuff, but we'll take a look at it and see what we get

00:29.920 --> 00:31.920
So here's a couple of the apps they picked okay?

00:32.440 --> 00:36.880
For productivity Matt you might like this one. They thought the best launcher was synapse

00:37.720 --> 00:42.940
Not knowing nice. Yeah, they say app launchers bring a lot to your workflow now

00:42.940 --> 00:46.680
They both note that unfortunately app launchers are in a weird spot in the Linux world

00:46.680 --> 00:50.560
Noam do hasn't had any major update since 2009 and synapse

00:50.560 --> 00:57.880
Also doesn't appear to be all but abandoned now, so I guess it's probably because a lot of desktops just build that in these days

00:57.880 --> 01:01.200
I think it's gonna take it all broken for anything to actually happen with it

01:01.200 --> 01:05.000
I think that's what will have to happen. Yeah. Yeah, okay. You ready for the text editor

01:05.600 --> 01:10.720
All right, Kate from KDE and genie which genie has been a pick before on the Linux action show

01:10.720 --> 01:16.400
I guess I don't know I supply him text to made a mate. They gave it a mention, but I

01:16.400 --> 01:20.920
Like Kate kind of you know it's great. If you're a KDE person. I don't know

01:22.520 --> 01:27.080
That's fine. It's kind of like saying yeah, it's great. If you're a good own person or a no person

01:27.080 --> 01:32.200
Yeah, I mean whatever. I want something a little sexier more exciting G. Okay. That's cool. Yeah, he's all right

01:32.200 --> 01:38.120
No is that I got it. I am oh, yeah, you know why did you do you know that or you know?

01:38.120 --> 01:47.080
I'm guessing I knew well you use Fedora, so it right well Red Hat is what it comes from oh, yeah

01:48.960 --> 01:53.480
Well here's the thing at Red Hat if you take any Red Hat course you'll be so sick of

01:54.000 --> 01:56.640
Knowing you have to do everything in vim basically

01:56.640 --> 02:00.760
It's all the courseware and everything for it you don't but the instructor will come up and go well

02:00.760 --> 02:01.840
I don't know how to oh yeah, you do

02:01.840 --> 02:05.600
Oh, you don't because when I was looking at it you did oh it was all oh in fact

02:05.600 --> 02:09.400
You know what when I was doing the Red Hat course the guy next to me couldn't remember how to get

02:09.640 --> 02:14.240
Repo configured and he broke into the oh no copy the RPMs off installed

02:15.360 --> 02:21.360
Instructor comes over calls Red Hat and they go did he use the internet no did he bring an outside material no he passes

02:21.360 --> 02:24.640
No, they don't care. They don't care how you get the objectives. No. I know that part

02:24.640 --> 02:28.440
Yeah, I know, but like like the culture of it's all it's gotta be inside. That's right. Yeah, yes

02:29.040 --> 02:33.660
Okay, they said best office editor Libre office all right. We can give them that best web browser, okay?

02:33.660 --> 02:37.600
Let's see here. The problem is it's negative in the freedom

02:38.280 --> 02:42.420
Dimension gave it to Chrome. They gave it to Chrome. It's not that's totally really. Yeah, it's not necessarily

02:42.420 --> 02:47.100
That's actually my next article topic. That's really funny really okay, and then email interesting, okay?

02:47.100 --> 02:52.760
I got a I got a I got a Thunderbird problem. There's definitely an advantage to Chrome in that it's getting

02:53.960 --> 03:00.240
Capsicum support even on Linux yeah, Chrome is you know I mean I keep trying to switch back to Firefox and Chrome keeps pulling me

03:00.240 --> 03:04.680
Back for a few reasons. I'd like my fire box. Yeah, especially under Linux

03:04.680 --> 03:09.520
Are you saying Thunderbird because that's what I could probably argue with you about they say Thunderbird development is slowed down

03:09.520 --> 03:12.280
But there's still their favorite desktop email client well

03:12.280 --> 03:16.600
Yes, there's no more development to do because it works perfectly fine stop breaking it

03:20.380 --> 03:24.320
The last couple times they've tried to do stuff to Thunderbird all they've done is made it worse

03:24.320 --> 03:30.680
So if they're just gonna stop and just do maintenance on it. I am a very happy badger. Yeah, I agree. I agree

03:30.680 --> 03:32.460
I think the pimification of it

03:32.460 --> 03:34.320
You know the personal information manager

03:34.320 --> 03:40.080
Effication of the Thunderbird was probably where they really went south so I think by sticking to just being an email client doing that well

03:40.080 --> 03:42.600
Oh, yeah, that's cool for me. It was mostly when they moved buttons

03:44.200 --> 03:47.440
Yeah, they did do a big redesign semi-recently

03:47.440 --> 03:53.240
And I like it now having tabs is very useful being able to keep all my sense stuff open in a second tab

03:53.240 --> 04:00.080
It's actually very useful. It's just every time they moved the buttons it messes up my entire flow man workflow. You got a flow

04:00.080 --> 04:04.000
I appreciate that because that's exactly how I am about I'm having I was gonna

04:04.000 --> 04:05.720
I was gonna bring this up in the post show

04:05.720 --> 04:10.040
But I'm having in fact I will remind me to I have a Thunderbolt like it's like a UI

04:10.240 --> 04:15.240
Wiggly issue that I thought I had solved a long time ago, and now I can't fix it, but

04:15.840 --> 04:18.920
Let's move on in the list, and then we'll wrap up because it's not too too amazing

04:18.920 --> 04:23.320
Now pigeon came in for the best instant messaging client they gave mention to empathy

04:23.920 --> 04:28.640
VLC for best video they gave mention to a few others Plex beat XBMC

04:29.480 --> 04:35.640
Which I thought was interesting those two they're kind of different though, right? Yeah, like ones for one thing and ones for another

04:35.640 --> 04:41.520
I Spotify for music wow

04:43.520 --> 04:49.720
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that just hit 50 and never looked better

04:50.320 --> 04:52.280
My name is Chris

04:52.280 --> 04:59.000
Hey, Matt. Hello welcome to episode 50 buddy. All right already. I know can you believe it?

04:59.040 --> 05:03.400
Can you but it's crazy, and you know what it's a special episode too because we're packing up

05:03.400 --> 05:08.640
We're getting ready to go down to OS con and so Noah mr. Colonel Linux himself has joined us

05:08.640 --> 05:13.240
I have in studio Noah welcome to life some plug. Thanks for having me good to have you here in meat space

05:13.840 --> 05:17.880
It's nice. I like the Google you were still rocking the Google glass have you been recording this whole thing I?

05:18.400 --> 05:23.380
Actually, I did record the intro just a little bit. Okay good good. How's the fedora install going absolutely well actually

05:23.380 --> 05:27.660
I'm just in a terminal in the IRC so I haven't really played with it, okay

05:27.660 --> 05:29.800
Yeah, I loaded him up a box with fedora 21

05:29.800 --> 05:34.720
So he'd feel right at home because he's a fedora guy he shows up with an arch box man and set it right on your desk

05:34.720 --> 05:40.700
Wow, yeah, you know respect a curveball curveball. Well. We got some good stuff to get into today

05:40.700 --> 05:46.020
We're also joined of course by our virtual lug over there the mumble room glad to have them along. Hey. Oh everybody

05:46.320 --> 05:51.400
Hey, I wanted to start with some feedback like we often do there was some pics

05:51.400 --> 05:54.240
We had on Linux action show for bandwidth monitoring

05:54.240 --> 06:00.120
I think it was MBW Mon on Sunday, and we ended up getting a note in from a plasma widget author named Rob

06:00.120 --> 06:03.480
And he wrote and he said hey Chris and Matt on the last show you were discussing

06:03.800 --> 06:08.000
Your appreciation for a simple bandwidth monitor at the risk of tooting my own horn

06:08.000 --> 06:11.220
I wanted to add a quick plug for my own project socket sentry

06:11.220 --> 06:15.060
Which is my favorite bandwidth monitor on the KD desktop, so it's awesome to hear from him

06:15.060 --> 06:20.400
He says it's a bandwidth monitor in KD plasma widget that you can leave on your desktop or dock as a panel icon

06:20.400 --> 06:26.280
What sets it apart from similar tools though is that it breaks down bandwidth per process or program?

06:26.280 --> 06:31.720
So you can quickly see whether your network slowdown is caused by Firefox or SFTP for example

06:31.720 --> 06:37.480
It uses lib pcap under the hood so you can filter the traffic at monitors using the same expression language and tools like TCP

06:37.480 --> 06:44.360
Dump a wireshark and also goes easy on the CPU in fact when it's hidden in your panel as an icon it stops monitoring until

06:44.360 --> 06:46.940
You pop it up, so there's no overhead when you don't need it

06:46.940 --> 06:52.980
It's in the AUR as KD plasma dash applets dash sock century or socket century

06:52.980 --> 06:54.920
I haven't updated in a few years

06:54.920 --> 06:59.160
But that's mainly because it does everything it needs to do and it works under modern versions of KD

06:59.160 --> 07:01.220
So I'd love to know what you think and thanks. Give up the great work

07:01.220 --> 07:04.480
Well, I've already tried it out before every time I set up KD. I set this thing up

07:04.480 --> 07:07.120
Are you like this I know with your do you have like?

07:07.720 --> 07:12.680
Conky and bandwidth monitors on your desktop, so here's the thing I test out a lot of different laptops

07:12.960 --> 07:15.980
To see how they're gonna work and how they're gonna work in specific circumstances

07:15.980 --> 07:19.280
So I switch like I have a different machine now than then when you saw me a couple months ago

07:19.280 --> 07:21.640
Yeah, because of that I try and keep it

07:21.640 --> 07:25.040
I change things as I go along it starts out sucking that when something bugs me

07:25.040 --> 07:28.600
Then I'll add it in that is that is exactly how I do it especially like right now

07:28.600 --> 07:33.200
We've been moving hardware around. I'm not even like using the same computer week to week anymore right so

07:33.960 --> 07:38.440
Having the ability to just keep it as close to stock means that I can get up and working a little bit faster

07:38.440 --> 07:42.060
And then the longer I use a machine the more I bring it under my control mm-hmm

07:42.060 --> 07:46.780
What about you Matt are you a tweaker with your like do you have a CPU monitor on your desktop and all that stuff?

07:46.780 --> 07:49.900
I do I generally prefer to kind of go with a gooey option

07:49.900 --> 07:53.820
I usually I'll have it something that can kind of peek at although recently I found myself

07:54.220 --> 07:56.900
Kind of removing myself from using that more

07:56.900 --> 08:01.580
And I'm almost just kind of trusting what I don't know because I find that my OCD tends to yeah

08:01.900 --> 08:06.340
Yeah, I can it can be distracting can it too like it can like you can be like what's going on up there

08:06.340 --> 08:12.140
And it really let's be honest computers are powerful enough and Linux is good enough and managing processes that it's not really necessary

08:12.140 --> 08:14.140
You know what I mean, so especially

08:15.700 --> 08:17.780
Killing it anyway, so whatever yeah

08:18.600 --> 08:19.900
Go ahead Alan

08:19.900 --> 08:20.420
Yeah

08:20.420 --> 08:26.620
Well you have eight processors the percent CPU load actually can matter less and then a widget can't be big enough to

08:26.980 --> 08:30.940
Display all eight threads on your CPU right it might be showing one core in the widget

08:30.940 --> 08:37.580
And you have seven other cores that are idle yeah, you know if you have eight cores then each one's like 13% or whatever and so

08:38.200 --> 08:43.020
when your CPU usage you can't actually tell that some program is actually pegged on one CPU and

08:43.340 --> 08:49.940
Would be going faster if it was multi threaded or whatever so I don't know I don't ever see the my desktop

08:49.940 --> 08:52.900
I always have whatever I'm working on like I might have multiple windows

08:53.020 --> 08:59.860
But I never see what's in the background like my desktop wallpaper or any and we just have it up and put there

08:59.860 --> 09:03.060
Yeah, yeah, if you're saying your desktop. You're not working on

09:04.900 --> 09:09.500
Sounds like he's saying hey guys. You know while you're looking at your desktops and making them pretty I'm getting work done

09:11.260 --> 09:16.740
What if you're like me and you just have a monitor just for all your crap like I have a crap monitor sometimes in some

09:16.740 --> 09:18.140
Of my setups. I'm a bad person

09:18.140 --> 09:24.260
Yeah, in fact that brings us to our next email from steve-o now unfortunately q5 sis who rocks a six monitor Linux setup

09:24.260 --> 09:26.260
Didn't join us today because he's working late

09:26.260 --> 09:31.100
But maybe he'll be able to chime in those chime in on this feedback style, but steve-o writes, and he says hey guys

09:31.660 --> 09:33.500
I've been researching

09:33.500 --> 09:38.620
Possible multi monitor setups for gaming under Linux and there seems to be a lot of conflicting information

09:38.620 --> 09:44.140
I found a reddit post talking about how difficult it is to set up particularly with two video cards on the other hand

09:44.140 --> 09:49.900
I found posted for Onyx any links to a for Onyx quad monitor review which seems to indicate. It's fairly easy

09:49.900 --> 09:54.700
I'm a Linux admin by trade, and I've been using Linux on my desktop since 2006 however

09:54.700 --> 09:57.780
This will be my first time really considering more than two monitors for my home setup

09:58.220 --> 10:03.740
Ideally I'd like to get a six monitor setup going cheers. I know right

10:04.860 --> 10:08.300
Anybody tried a multi monitor setup with gaming is it get weird

10:09.100 --> 10:13.100
You ever tried it Noah. Nope. I have multi monitors, but I don't use it for gaming. Yeah

10:13.100 --> 10:18.380
well, I bet I go ahead I've tried it for I've tried it for like flight simulation and

10:18.380 --> 10:24.180
It works kind of but that was also like back in

10:24.460 --> 10:27.300
2004 when it didn't really work as well as it does now

10:27.300 --> 10:32.780
I'm not sure about now Riley now a lot of times it comes down to whether the game supports it or not sure yeah

10:32.780 --> 10:37.460
If the game isn't meant to be split then you end up with like an after screen on one monitor and half on the other

10:37.460 --> 10:39.780
Monitor in this and under the Linux to that

10:39.780 --> 10:45.580
There's a bit of an extra like what toolkit or whatever did they write it towards like are they using SDL or whatnot Riley thinks?

10:45.580 --> 11:00.980
Riley you think this is a case for awesome? I think I remember q5 saying he uses open box

11:00.980 --> 11:06.420
You remember what he says he uses for his setup. What's the default in in puppy? I don't know well except

11:06.420 --> 11:12.380
He doesn't use his open box. He's crazy. Does he he's crazy using puppy, but anyways

11:12.380 --> 11:16.100
We'd love to get your inputs because I mean I you know what I just got X plane on Steam

11:16.100 --> 11:23.700
It was it was not cheap either, but yeah, well that's on my wish list X plane is have you played it? Yeah, it's amazing

11:23.740 --> 11:30.660
Yeah, you know they have actually hardware devices you can bring in and have like the full experience. Yeah, yeah

11:30.660 --> 11:37.020
I mean they're crazy expensive. Yeah. Yeah, I looked at the only computer-based flight simulator that is certified by the FAA

11:37.340 --> 11:42.020
Right or actually doing stuff from getting time. Yeah, you can log hours. What's amazing?

11:42.020 --> 11:47.340
Yeah is ours you can take off right here at our local Arlington Airport and or SeaTac

11:47.380 --> 11:49.740
So I was just blown away by it

11:49.740 --> 11:55.740
So I I I could see where steve-o is coming from here because I'm looking at the I'm looking at X plane

11:55.740 --> 11:58.300
And I'm thinking I had a few monitors this would be kind of amazing

11:58.740 --> 12:03.740
And I'd love to hear how it works out for you Steve and if anybody out there has any advice or feedback

12:03.740 --> 12:06.540
You can drop us a line in the Linux unplugged

12:06.540 --> 12:11.780
feedback thread over at linuxactionshow.reddit.com or go to Jupiter broadcasting.com slash contact and

12:12.020 --> 12:18.060
Shoot us an email with your thoughts on what Steve could do to win with six monitors and video games

12:19.620 --> 12:23.320
Yeah, that sounds like that could be a bumpy ride right I'm thinking zone minder

12:23.320 --> 12:28.340
That's the first thing that comes to my mind is is to have a compound and to have zone minders and gun turrets you got

12:28.340 --> 12:30.180
to have gun turrets I

12:30.180 --> 12:35.520
Want high-caliber gun turrets. I'm talking about like full. You know set them up on raspberry pies. They motion sensing

12:35.520 --> 12:40.620
I'm talking the whole package. I like this now. This is this is like the zombie apocalypse bunker

12:40.620 --> 12:41.740
That's powered by Linux

12:41.740 --> 12:45.780
And I think there's a I think there's a role to play in there for some raspberry pie devices, too

12:45.780 --> 12:51.180
And you know Matt before that zombie apocalypse hits you might want to get yourself a digital ocean droplet

12:51.180 --> 12:56.060
So that way you can back up your data and protect it from those zombies go over to digital ocean comm and use the promo

12:56.060 --> 13:00.920
Code get ready for this because July is almost over. It's your last chance to use it unplug July

13:00.920 --> 13:07.600
How about that unplugged July when you check out over digital ocean comm that's gonna give you ten dollars towards a digital ocean droplet

13:07.600 --> 13:13.900
Run that sucker for two months why because for five dollars you can create a cloud server in 55 seconds and pricing plans are

13:14.320 --> 13:17.680
Straightforward you start the five dollar mark, and then you'll work your way up at each incarnation

13:17.760 --> 13:22.280
You get something really great more storage more bandwidth more CPU really straightforward

13:22.280 --> 13:26.600
But here's what you get for five dollars you get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte

13:26.600 --> 13:31.600
SSD one blazing fast CPU and a terabyte of transfer all at a fixed cost for five dollars

13:31.600 --> 13:35.440
So you know exactly how much you're gonna pay and I want to underscore that I don't want you to go out there and get

13:35.440 --> 13:39.960
A cloud system where you get oh, here's my CPU bill. Here's my transfer bill. Oh, it's a $200 bill

13:39.960 --> 13:44.880
That's actually happened to me, and it's a painful process. I had to explain it to my boss, and it was very awkward

13:44.880 --> 13:49.440
I is like hey boss. Sorry. Yeah, I put that on the card. I hope you don't mind look

13:49.440 --> 13:50.880
That's what I love about digital ocean

13:50.880 --> 13:55.000
It's a fixed cost which also means that as a contractor if I was gonna resell it it makes it super easy if I'm building

13:55.000 --> 13:57.800
An open source project or I'm using it as a back end for an app

13:57.800 --> 14:01.520
I know exactly what my run cost is gonna be and digital ocean is so simple

14:01.520 --> 14:05.600
They're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy to spin up cloud service you get root access

14:05.760 --> 14:10.620
We've had users out there. They've done it under 31 seconds. It's unbelievable how fast you can do it

14:10.620 --> 14:13.000
And they've got a brand new London data center

14:13.000 --> 14:17.960
They just spun up the new London data center pretty cool and some of the audience members have been jumping on that

14:18.520 --> 14:22.980
They also have data center locations in New York San Francisco Singapore and Amsterdam

14:22.980 --> 14:29.780
their interface is simple and their control panel is incredibly intuitive and power users can replicate that control panel on a much larger scale with

14:29.780 --> 14:31.780
their straightforward API which is

14:32.100 --> 14:36.060
Gorgeous now. I'm not one to just talk chauvinistically about API's

14:36.060 --> 14:39.460
But as far as good-looking API's go this digital ocean one is good-looking

14:39.460 --> 14:40.140
I've heard good things

14:40.140 --> 14:42.560
And that's why you're seeing really great apps in the community prop up

14:42.660 --> 14:48.700
Apps that integrate with the Ubuntu desktop the Mac desktop Windows desktop you can manage your droplet right from your desktop check on its status

14:48.700 --> 14:52.540
Get its IP and then when you need to go to the digital ocean website their interface is incredible

14:52.540 --> 14:54.540
their interface sets the bar it

14:54.820 --> 14:59.380
utilizes the power of Linux KVM connected to tier 1 bandwidth and data centers all over the world and

14:59.420 --> 15:02.540
Gives you access to do all of that in a matter of seconds

15:02.540 --> 15:08.380
Go create yourself a droplet right now and use the code unplugged July when you check out to get a $10 credit

15:08.380 --> 15:14.380
You can use that $5 rig for two months for absolutely free and a big thanks to digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplugged

15:15.380 --> 15:19.020
Yeah, man. I tell you what we just spun up a new one here for a little secret project

15:19.020 --> 15:23.180
We're working on in the skunk works laboratory over Jupiter broadcasting comm

15:23.580 --> 15:28.380
All right, I got what we're kind of a follow-up email from jay-z a longtime viewer of the Linux action show

15:28.860 --> 15:31.860
He writes in on encapsulated Linux applications. We've been talking about

15:32.740 --> 15:37.260
Container izing applications on the Linux desktop quad X next week. That's the gnome developer conference

15:37.940 --> 15:41.540
That's gonna be a huge topic there. Yeah, maybe the main topic

15:41.540 --> 15:45.260
I don't know I'm just guessing but it's gonna be big so jay-z a writes in it says hey

15:45.260 --> 15:49.220
I wondered why you haven't talked much about Linux portable apps. It's a really great

15:49.220 --> 15:53.580
It's really great for users that don't deal with dependencies on different distros and such

15:53.820 --> 15:58.100
Even the portable Linux games is awesome since games are non-standard on Linux installs

15:58.100 --> 16:02.700
And he links us to portable Linux games org. He says let us let me know what you think and check it out

16:02.700 --> 16:08.020
Have you seen this man? No, no, I haven't you're probably familiar with the whole portable apps concept on

16:09.100 --> 16:13.900
Winders, have you seen the portable? Yeah, it's really kind of cool. I'll tell you a little bit

16:13.900 --> 16:20.780
It's it's based around this technology called app image kit and app image kit is a format

16:20.780 --> 16:24.300
That is it lets you have that if you're watching the video version here

16:24.300 --> 16:29.420
I've I've brought up a little bit of a diagram and you can see it's essentially a self-contained image file

16:29.420 --> 16:34.620
You've got an executable in there that could be 32-bit or 64-bit and then you've got a directory structure

16:34.620 --> 16:38.860
That sort of replicates slash user slash bin slash lib and slash share

16:38.860 --> 16:44.780
So everything lives in this single image kit file and then you can move this around and it can link to

16:45.380 --> 16:50.420
Libraries outside the image kit file or you can have everything statically linked self-contained in there. I basically got it, right?

16:50.420 --> 16:51.300
Yeah, that's it

16:51.300 --> 16:58.300
And so the portable Linux games site has taken this technology and applied it to video games and essentially

16:58.460 --> 17:00.920
Some of these are just a simple download and run

17:01.040 --> 17:06.760
Some of them are a quick download you run the shell script or the pearl script and then you have a completely containerized

17:06.760 --> 17:11.840
Application that you can put on pretty much any Linux box and just distribute as an HTTP download. It's pretty cool

17:12.600 --> 17:18.000
Interesting. Yeah, and I think it's something I want to play a little bit with I've heard of it never used it

17:18.000 --> 17:21.480
I don't know how I don't know if it works out of the box on arch or what, right?

17:24.400 --> 17:30.160
To say but I think that's how the PDI system that the new version is is going to work is kind of the same idea

17:30.160 --> 17:34.400
Is it the app is in this like virtual file system and self-contained so you just move it around

17:34.400 --> 17:37.400
And I don't want to be the guy to say but I think this is how the Mac does it, too

17:37.400 --> 17:41.920
Oh, really? I think it is. Yes. I think that's been done at least a couple of times before

17:42.840 --> 17:47.680
So how does this compare to say the old click click project?

17:47.680 --> 17:49.960
I mean, it seems like there's a little bit of a correlation there

17:49.960 --> 17:54.200
Yeah, I'm not sure like how they distributed it on like how they did the libraries and things like that

17:54.200 --> 17:58.820
I don't know if there's a correlation there or if it's more just similar and functionality and concept

17:59.200 --> 18:03.560
Okay, it's not here to talk about it. Oh that poppy go figure, right?

18:03.560 --> 18:07.660
He's probably doing something Ubuntu ish. You can find a chicken. Yeah

18:09.760 --> 18:10.680
Yes

18:10.680 --> 18:12.680
Poppy chasing the chicken is the thing

18:12.680 --> 18:18.540
The app image kit is up on github and they're working on it and the Linux portable game guys are working with them, too

18:18.540 --> 18:20.600
Oh, hi there. Hey chrome. How you doing? And

18:21.640 --> 18:23.640
They got a lot of good games from quake

18:24.200 --> 18:28.040
She's look at all this stuff. You just have a crap ton you guys star conflicts up there, too

18:28.480 --> 18:31.480
Wow Z NES the emulator is up there

18:31.480 --> 18:37.360
Zero AD is on the site. Look at all this stuff abuse pioneer flare. I got to check this out

18:37.360 --> 18:40.640
I think I'm gonna try this maybe on my train ride. Yeah, what all right

18:40.640 --> 18:43.520
As long as that Wi-Fi connections working just do a little download

18:43.520 --> 18:48.120
I'd be really curious to see if it just works and I guess it's supposed to support 64-bit or 32-bit

18:48.680 --> 18:52.320
So jza sent that in it. So just for some of the details the app image

18:52.320 --> 18:56.000
This is something that's already out there. That's why I find this fascinating since this is becoming such a big topic

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Yeah, I'm app image is an ISO

18:58.000 --> 19:04.080
966 oh file the contents of the file can be compressed with the ZF so you can even make it smaller and the standard supports that

19:04.360 --> 19:08.680
The after contains one desktop file per the free desktop or dot org spec

19:08.680 --> 19:12.920
So any desktop that implements that dot desktop file, which is all of them

19:13.240 --> 19:18.200
Will be able to read the file and just add a menu entry to your desktop to KDE or GNOME

19:18.200 --> 19:20.520
So it even works in with your integrated

19:21.400 --> 19:25.760
Desktop menu system. Now. Do you think this could larger scale become a

19:25.760 --> 19:31.840
Larger scale become a unit a way to bring a unified installer to Linux. Yeah, I do

19:31.840 --> 19:36.360
I mean, I think it is actually I think it's offering that today. I think that's exactly what it's offering today

19:36.360 --> 19:40.920
It's just not widespread. Do you think it'll become I guess culturally accepted? No, I

19:41.480 --> 19:45.460
Think this is one of those things where something this scale

19:46.520 --> 19:52.920
It almost has to come from somebody with the appropriate weight to move it. Oh, you know what I mean?

19:52.920 --> 19:57.680
I'm kind of saying I'm kind of saying Red Hat. Yeah, that's kind of working on it. Cool. Well, you don't think so

19:57.680 --> 20:03.620
No, I think no. No, I I I yeah, I mean come on Sousa

20:05.020 --> 20:09.120
No, I'm serious like I mean I you guys know, I mean just over the record

20:09.340 --> 20:15.280
We know people we like people who work for Sousa. I used to deploy Sousa Enterprise Linux as part of my job

20:15.280 --> 20:17.460
I thought it was the best Enterprise Linux

20:17.460 --> 20:22.460
I was a hat. So how how I mean, how is Sousa stain relevant these days?

20:22.460 --> 20:25.220
I love what they're working on too, which is the shame of it

20:25.220 --> 20:28.320
I love the evergreen cons or the whatever the evergreen concept they have

20:28.320 --> 20:30.500
I love the build service all of that the studio

20:30.500 --> 20:37.740
But so what do you go to when you want a when you want a desktop environment that that's commercially supported CentOS

20:37.900 --> 20:42.560
Well, yeah, but that's not I mean that's you can buy support for yeah, but it's meant more towards servers though, right?

20:42.560 --> 20:47.980
I mean, you're not gonna sit there. You're not gonna have somebody do realistically Chrome OS. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's yeah

20:47.980 --> 20:53.540
Yeah, I mean that's what's unfortunate right is now that CentOS is a legitimate Red Hat project

20:54.940 --> 21:00.900
That's and then you have Ubuntu who's rocking it on the cloud space to that markets really getting tied up, right?

21:00.900 --> 21:06.540
I think in the back end. Yes, but I don't I don't see too many people sitting down at their workstations and using CentOS to

21:07.580 --> 21:11.620
Yeah, I don't think there's I don't think people are really competing right there right now

21:11.620 --> 21:17.020
I mean, I think the only person really competing there is Google sure. I mean I'm canonical sure

21:17.020 --> 21:21.540
I mean you're seeing a lot of LTS deployments there, but I think that's despite their efforts. Mm-hmm. I

21:22.300 --> 21:26.380
Don't know. I don't mean to dog on openSUSE, but I've been it's just actually something

21:26.380 --> 21:27.980
I've been thinking a lot about off airs

21:27.980 --> 21:33.420
Where do they really fit in in the political structure now for Linux and when you think about moving something like this app image

21:33.420 --> 21:35.420
kit format forward

21:35.420 --> 21:40.360
I I mean, okay. Let's this isn't as big but it's almost as big as like system D

21:40.360 --> 21:45.760
Almost could you picture system D succeeding if it was an openSUSE effort or a SUSE effort? No

21:46.220 --> 21:48.740
Could you see it succeeding if it was anybody but right now?

21:48.740 --> 21:54.760
But I say that primarily based on the fact that upstart was so heavily backed by canonical and canonical had so much

21:54.900 --> 21:57.100
Driving force behind it behind upstart already

21:57.340 --> 22:03.680
So you have to come to the table with something that offers a lot more and be backed by someone that's as big or bigger

22:03.680 --> 22:06.460
Right. Yeah, Riley makes a good point. Go ahead Riley

22:15.100 --> 22:19.540
Yeah, I will no I think it's a really well engineered high quality distribution

22:19.540 --> 22:24.140
I think it may be sometimes people find the package management with zipper and stuff is a little foreign still

22:24.140 --> 22:27.340
It's maybe not quite as tight as they want and you tied in

22:27.340 --> 22:34.420
As far as a nice Nome or a nice KDE implementation goes openSUSE or 13.1 is great. Mm-hmm

22:34.420 --> 22:36.420
Mm-hmm. Yeah another really good. I

22:36.860 --> 22:42.100
Thought the point of SUSE was basically to be the alternative to Red Hat for enterprises

22:42.100 --> 22:47.640
But I don't know if anybody really wants an alternative. Well, I think it's I think it's Ubuntu LTS. Unfortunately

22:47.700 --> 22:50.500
Yeah, I mean you really is you've got existing market moment

22:51.220 --> 22:55.740
I guess you've been to good works on servers, doesn't it? I think I think they've I think they've pretty

22:55.740 --> 23:00.460
Handsomely surpassed the SUSE's installation base Google. Yeah, they have a specific

23:01.180 --> 23:03.940
Download for installing on servers, right?

23:03.940 --> 23:09.500
I've seen that and on easy to when I guess when Google went to dump a lot of the Red Hat servers

23:09.500 --> 23:13.060
They went to Ubuntu. So yeah, tell you yeah

23:13.740 --> 23:20.020
Yeah, well on to actually and it wasn't it just was it just Spotify who just publicly announced they're switching from Debian to Ubuntu

23:20.140 --> 23:22.060
Yeah, that's right. That's right

23:22.060 --> 23:27.580
And and the reason is is because they just get a slightly better mixture of packages and they like the LTS schedule that they can

23:27.580 --> 23:29.460
Set their IT clock to

23:29.460 --> 23:32.060
And I well, I want to make sure I'm being clear

23:32.060 --> 23:36.540
I don't I'm not dogging on the quality of SUSE the people who work on SUSE or what SUSE it does

23:36.540 --> 23:40.920
I think he asked is great. I think it's still one of the most well thought out distributions from top to bottom

23:41.140 --> 23:44.260
It has saved my ass several times. They have like recovery modes

23:44.260 --> 23:47.740
You can go into that literally got us back up and working. I'm not saying any of that

23:47.740 --> 23:50.100
I'm saying the market seems to be deciding these things

23:50.100 --> 23:51.340
Mm-hmm

23:51.340 --> 23:55.620
Despite their best intentions and efforts and so when I look at this app image kit

23:55.620 --> 23:57.620
It feels like you know

23:57.620 --> 24:03.260
Red Hat and fedora and Ubuntu would all and Debian really together would all have to get behind it to really make it work

24:03.260 --> 24:06.340
But it has to start with somebody that has the ability to push it

24:06.340 --> 24:07.860
It can't just you know what I mean?

24:07.860 --> 24:09.860
Like eventually there has to be an entire

24:10.180 --> 24:15.460
Consensus consensus like we saw with system D eventually and it was awful and embarrassing but we got there

24:15.580 --> 24:17.580
We're still kind of not there, but we got there

24:17.580 --> 24:24.300
The same thing would have to happen with this right and it has to be started off by somebody who can just you know champion

24:24.300 --> 24:31.500
I mean would system D have been successful if it wasn't for Lenart out there taking on every criticism or responding with massively detailed technical

24:31.580 --> 24:33.900
Explanations explaining why things are the way they are

24:33.900 --> 24:41.220
I don't look Lenart was the person who you could probably attribute a lot of publicly pushing system D through

24:41.380 --> 24:43.260
Who's gonna do this for the standard right?

24:43.260 --> 24:48.260
But if you have the gnome group working on desktop container ization you get some of those same people now

24:48.260 --> 24:51.140
They're gonna be pushing that standard right and that might have the momentum

24:51.660 --> 24:55.100
All you need is just a couple distributions to latch on so that it becomes

24:55.620 --> 24:58.620
You're the you're the you're the you're the ugly red stepchild

24:58.700 --> 25:03.060
Yeah, if if you don't follow that standard right once you can establish that right then everything else

25:03.060 --> 25:03.900
What's your odd man out?

25:03.900 --> 25:08.540
It's actually harder to work on your system because you don't do something right even if Ubuntu and Red Hat

25:08.540 --> 25:12.140
You know you get like two or three of them that had a standardized package installer

25:12.140 --> 25:17.020
I think everything else would follow yeah, maybe not everything I mean you're always gonna have yeah like you arch people or slack

25:17.020 --> 25:22.980
Yeah, something like that. Yeah, I'm sorry fedora guy couldn't hear you over the sound of your fedora still installing all right

25:22.980 --> 25:24.980
Well, I wanted to move us to us

25:24.980 --> 25:30.220
Something kind of cool that we have coming up get your nostalgia hats on everybody

25:30.860 --> 25:33.540
You know we're gonna go back in time here in a few minutes

25:33.820 --> 25:37.060
Q5 system been working on a way back machine for the Linux unplugged show

25:37.300 --> 25:41.180
Something kind of we've all been running some of us been running links for a long time some of us are new

25:41.180 --> 25:44.460
But I think it's always good to go back and see where we come from before we do that

25:44.460 --> 25:50.860
I want to thank this week's sponsor ting go over to Linux dot ting.com why because it's got Linux in the URL

25:51.340 --> 25:55.940
Seriously Linux dot ting.com that also lets them know you appreciate them sponsored Linux unplugged show

25:55.940 --> 26:01.340
But unless you check out ting what is ting ting is mobile that makes sense my mobile service fighter and Matt's mobile service fighter in

26:01.340 --> 26:07.360
fact right well over a year now and ting rocks because it's only a flat six dollars per month and just your usage on top

26:07.360 --> 26:13.340
Of that no contract no early termination fee, and I gotta tell you that's very handy as I'm going out on a trip

26:13.340 --> 26:16.420
I don't have to worry about any of that stuff. Yeah, I'm gonna be using my phone a lot more

26:16.420 --> 26:18.420
I'll just pay for what I use easy-peasy

26:18.500 --> 26:23.260
No problemo if I get to a spot where I need hotspot or tethering I just check the box in the OS

26:23.260 --> 26:25.940
I don't have to be part of some sort of mobile family share program

26:25.940 --> 26:29.540
I don't have to pay some certain amount of data just in case I use a gigabyte

26:29.540 --> 26:32.620
I just pay for what I use and I use the features built into the operating system

26:32.620 --> 26:37.740
You want to use ting as a mobile ISP do it they like it. They don't care. They like it plus

26:37.740 --> 26:42.380
They've got no whole customer service you call them a 1 8 5 5 ting FTW anytime between 8 a.m.. Or 8 p.m.. Boom

26:42.860 --> 26:49.340
A real person answers the phone. I know it's crazy your mobile phone operator can actually help you because they've empowered their support staff

26:49.420 --> 26:55.200
What a concept plus they have an incredible dashboard over to the last or linux.com don't go to last.com Noah

26:55.580 --> 26:58.300
Except on Sundays well, that's true. That's true

26:58.300 --> 27:02.780
Yeah, you know what you know what you know the last time I went to linux.com was

27:03.340 --> 27:05.340
30 seconds ago well no

27:05.540 --> 27:12.540
But but last right before I left I had this problem I the my wife helps me answer the phone for our company

27:12.540 --> 27:15.900
Oh great. Yeah, well. She's with me. So she's gonna be hard to answer the phone right?

27:15.900 --> 27:19.980
Yeah, so I hired a girl that was gonna answer the phone at the times that she wasn't gonna be available

27:19.980 --> 27:22.860
Yeah, well now she has to have a phone right, but I can't give her a cell phone

27:22.860 --> 27:26.580
I don't have an extra two hundred dollars to spend on a cell phone right and then I'd have nothing to do with it

27:26.580 --> 27:31.300
Afterwards right so they have this home connect thing that I bought for like $30 off of eBay

27:31.300 --> 27:34.100
Yeah, and with the BYOD bring it over I activate it

27:34.100 --> 27:37.540
I plug a phone in and now she's got a phone in her apartment and a laptop six dollars month

27:37.540 --> 27:41.060
That's right easy peasy. Yeah, and you can you can go in the dashboard. You can set alerts

27:41.060 --> 27:46.220
Yeah, we we've hired a part-time nanny which turned out to be even cheaper than daycare which is great

27:46.260 --> 27:48.800
But her phone service is super spotty well

27:48.800 --> 27:53.060
She's got our kids sometimes so we want to have really make sure that she we can always send her a message always get her on

27:53.060 --> 27:56.980
The phone so we're just gonna get her a great device from ting because then it's only six dollars a month

27:56.980 --> 27:59.580
And it's just gonna be super cheap for text messaging it

27:59.580 --> 28:02.740
There's all kinds of opportunities and possibilities go to linux.ting.com

28:03.260 --> 28:07.220
That'll take $25 off your first device if you've got a device compatible with the ting network

28:07.340 --> 28:12.180
I'll give you a $25 credit if you're like me that lasted more than my first month of service

28:12.180 --> 28:15.620
I'll tell you what the first time I ever had a total free month of cell phone service

28:15.900 --> 28:17.580
That was a special moment in my life

28:17.580 --> 28:19.180
I will never forget that

28:19.180 --> 28:23.260
Linux.ting.com go get a special moment in your life and see why I switched a ting

28:23.260 --> 28:26.540
They've also got early termination relief programs if you're stuck in one of those

28:26.980 --> 28:31.020
contracts linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring

28:31.740 --> 28:33.400
Linux unplugged

28:33.400 --> 28:37.120
Okay, let's go back in time five years ago July 2009

28:37.340 --> 28:42.100
That's not too long, but it's a long time in computer history right mm-hmm especially in internet time

28:42.100 --> 28:45.260
You know here's a couple of things that happened in the Linux world

28:45.260 --> 28:49.180
And then you guys jump in at any point if there's anything you want to nostalgia ties about

28:49.740 --> 28:56.120
But let's talk about probably the one that just is the most relevant to the conversation. We're just having in July

28:56.780 --> 29:01.260
2009 Google officially announced Google Chrome OS

29:01.340 --> 29:04.380
They say we've designed Google Chrome for people who live on the web

29:04.700 --> 29:09.660
Searching information checking email catching up on the news and shopping or just staying in touch with friends however

29:09.660 --> 29:17.480
The operating system the browsers on the people browse on we're not designed in an era where there was a web so today

29:17.620 --> 29:23.060
We're announcing a new project. That's a natural extension of Google Chrome the Google Chrome

29:23.700 --> 29:30.620
Operating system in our attempt to rethink what an operating system should be so there you go five years ago

29:30.620 --> 29:34.660
Google Chrome was born this month. Do you feel it does it feel like it was five years ago to you

29:34.660 --> 29:39.580
Does you know I seem to remember all the going back and forth about how it's all well?

29:39.580 --> 29:44.900
It's never gonna happen or you know the Google's never gonna actually do this sort of thing then it happened and everybody seemed to be

29:44.900 --> 29:46.900
Almost in denial about there was a lot of room

29:47.460 --> 29:51.340
Last Microsoft will squish them. You know no big deal five years ago

29:51.340 --> 29:56.180
I don't think living in the cloud was as feasible as it is today, right? It's more crazy didn't it?

29:56.180 --> 29:58.260
Yeah, I wasn't started

29:58.260 --> 30:04.560
I was just starting a university at the time and then when they announced Chrome OS to actually be or Chrome

30:05.020 --> 30:07.020
to be released I

30:07.660 --> 30:11.180
Predicted they will make a friggin operating system based on Chrome

30:11.180 --> 30:16.160
And that was right when they released Chrome when I first started University when they started Chrome OS

30:16.160 --> 30:19.400
I was like yes, no I have don't have to build this damn thing on my own

30:19.580 --> 30:20.980
They're gonna build it for me

30:20.980 --> 30:25.540
Yeah, it was like gubuntu like a lot of people thought there'd be gu linux like they thought they were gonna do something

30:25.540 --> 30:29.500
I'm going to call it talks box. I will admit this Joe's name

30:29.500 --> 30:34.580
I don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure I was a naysayer about because I just thought this was a dumb idea well

30:34.580 --> 30:36.620
To me it seemed like netbooks reheated

30:36.620 --> 30:43.460
I still think it's a dumb idea, but I think it's I think it's a dumb idea because I can't like I bought a pixel

30:43.460 --> 30:48.860
I bought the nicest Chromebook money can buy right yeah, you did and I left Chrome on there for almost 30 seconds

30:48.860 --> 30:50.860
Yeah, I tried yeah, yeah

30:50.860 --> 30:56.060
It just doesn't I can't I can't live. I'm a I'm a traditional right word mouse right

30:56.060 --> 31:01.220
Yeah, you ever just use Chrome OS like you have it on there you ever go back literally the first 30 seconds

31:01.220 --> 31:03.580
I tried it just to see what it was like and then I

31:04.180 --> 31:06.820
Went oh, I plugged in my thumb drive where I have all my files

31:06.820 --> 31:10.300
Yeah, but they're encrypted with Lux so I couldn't get to them right and that was the end of Chrome OS

31:10.300 --> 31:11.620
You know that's so funny

31:11.620 --> 31:17.060
You say that because my experience with my c720 was I basically gave it about a minute 30 and at the end of that

31:17.060 --> 31:20.860
I was like okay. Well. I can't get to this. I can't get to that all right time for arch. That was it

31:21.260 --> 31:25.380
and I kind of regret it a little bit because I feel like maybe I should have given it a go because

31:26.020 --> 31:29.260
Now that that was over a year ago now here

31:29.260 --> 31:31.900
We are and now I'm going between the studio and the house all the time

31:31.900 --> 31:32.660
mm-hmm and

31:32.660 --> 31:38.740
There are there are more days than not that I just don't bring a computer with me when I move between places and I just have

31:38.740 --> 31:40.780
Everything synchronized between the two locations

31:40.780 --> 31:46.220
And I sit down here at a computer and I sit down there at a computer at the house and everything's there and some of that

31:46.220 --> 31:48.980
Is because of Google Docs and Google Chrome sync and stuff right?

31:48.980 --> 31:54.660
But the problem is you're gonna have to make significant compromises in the Fort Fisher project to be able to make that happen, right?

31:54.660 --> 31:56.660
I got yeah, I know that's why

31:56.980 --> 32:01.760
The good opportunity or advantage of Chrome OS is that you cannot have to worry about getting binary

32:02.300 --> 32:07.360
updates from whoever gives you your updates you can patch or check at the source code or the

32:07.420 --> 32:12.900
Freaking code and fix the problem yourself on the Chromebook if you really want to instead of needing binary packages all the time

32:13.460 --> 32:14.860
Riley do you think this?

32:14.860 --> 32:17.460
this last five years has been a hit to privacy I

32:23.020 --> 32:26.260
Don't think it's actually a joke I would say this last five years has been I

32:26.860 --> 32:30.300
Think unequivocally privacy out of all things that suffered the most in the last five years

32:30.300 --> 32:31.740
So but you have to pray easily

32:31.740 --> 32:37.060
You have to prioritize all right like if our goal as Linux users is to switch as many people as we can to Linux

32:37.060 --> 32:42.100
But the I know that the fact runs in Linux and now everyone's going to stick us

32:42.100 --> 32:45.140
Let's face it. You're only moving more and more towards browser-based application

32:45.140 --> 32:50.500
The fact that Google Docs works as absolutely as well as it does under Windows or Mac is a huge win for your Linux

32:50.500 --> 32:53.740
I had to ask myself a couple months ago when Matt back in the predictions Matt

32:53.820 --> 32:57.080
Made the prediction that Chrome OS would be the new face of Linux, right?

32:57.080 --> 33:01.580
And yeah, my I had to sit down and ask myself. Am I okay with it?

33:01.580 --> 33:04.020
Would I be okay if when everyone thought of Linux?

33:04.500 --> 33:10.180
They thought of Chrome OS and I'm okay with that up to the extent that things start happening for Chrome OS that don't translate to

33:10.180 --> 33:15.380
Yeah, Netflix, right? Like why does Netflix work in Chrome when it's on a Chrome OS?

33:15.380 --> 33:20.420
But if I install Chrome on my house, but then I know if that becomes more prolific then we have a problem

33:20.420 --> 33:21.700
Then we're right back to where we started

33:21.700 --> 33:25.620
Well, and you are starting to see that because now you're gonna have things like Evernote run under Chrome OS

33:25.620 --> 33:30.620
But there's no Evernote for Linux. See that's bad. Yeah, that's really bad. That's actually worse than we were before

33:30.760 --> 33:35.180
Yeah, because everyone hated Microsoft Windows. I don't think everyone's gonna hate Chrome because it won't hang up all the time

33:35.180 --> 33:40.060
And it doesn't cost as much as well now, I mean if it's in Chrome

33:40.380 --> 33:45.860
Theoretically anything they add to Chrome OS if it's actually in the Chrome browser could come to regular Linux eventually, right?

33:45.900 --> 33:50.860
Well to kind of update the whole prediction thing here today and I forget exactly where I saw it

33:50.860 --> 33:54.780
But basically there's a news article talking about how the it's actually up

33:55.260 --> 34:02.780
250% as far as how they're selling and then the same comparable notebooks for Microsoft are just at a standstill

34:02.780 --> 34:10.420
Yeah, so, you know the market's speaking loud and clear Microsoft's is they're gonna have a $99 Windows competitor by holidays

34:10.420 --> 34:15.460
They have to they look at look at what the majority of home users are doing. They go on Facebook. They write letters

34:15.460 --> 34:20.300
They check email. Yeah, they go on Spotify. They you know, and so if if those are the things that you're doing

34:20.300 --> 34:23.580
Yeah, you can do that in a Chromebook. So why would you spend more than $200?

34:23.580 --> 34:28.340
I say Microsoft should bring it because think about you know what those are all gonna become cheap Linux boxes

34:28.340 --> 34:34.780
Most of them are gonna write eventually you become a Linux box make a $99 laptop. I'll run Linux on that. It won't take that long

34:35.300 --> 34:37.300
All right

34:37.620 --> 34:41.580
Yeah, exactly that's exactly what I would be thanks for the nice hardware Microsoft. Yeah

34:42.980 --> 34:44.820
Let me let me just put Linux on that

34:44.820 --> 34:45.140
All right

34:45.140 --> 34:48.620
So also in July open SUSE 11.2 got firmed up

34:48.940 --> 34:53.140
Sabi and 4.2 rocking it five years ago. In fact, there was a review of it

34:53.140 --> 34:58.460
People thought it was maybe one of the best gnome desktops if you wanted comp is fusion

35:00.860 --> 35:06.440
Yeah, crunch bang version 9.04 came out I don't let's go take a look

35:06.440 --> 35:11.000
I q5 got us a little time machine link here. Let's go see what crunch bang was doing five years ago

35:12.260 --> 35:17.460
Much improved boop. Oh, yeah boot time. Everybody was talking about boot time five years ago

35:17.460 --> 35:23.340
Every distro was talking about boot time and that's when we were seeing upstart make its way throughout Linux

35:23.660 --> 35:29.420
This transition over to transmission open box and GTK themes are now installed. You know made basic stuff

35:29.420 --> 35:33.660
It's curious. It's curious to me to see which distros were we're still releasing back. Oh, we still talk

35:36.700 --> 35:39.380
Right gotta have a JPEG turbo in there. Hey

35:40.220 --> 35:44.380
Mozilla just announced their version of JPEG turbo that makes smaller. Yes. Yes

35:44.380 --> 35:49.460
Yeah, and there was a there was an article at top of tech meme today about WebP from Google about why they want

35:49.460 --> 35:51.460
WebP to take off

35:52.220 --> 35:54.780
Hey Alan, you'll like this one five years ago

35:56.020 --> 35:59.580
2009 PC BSD seven dot one dot one was released

36:00.020 --> 36:04.860
This version was a maintenance release that they said this is the gale the gala gay

36:04.860 --> 36:11.460
Oh, why can't I say Galileo Galileo version of PC BSD is the most stable release yet is what they said

36:11.460 --> 36:16.700
It was seven dot one ten dot one is going to be amazeballs though. Oh, yeah

36:18.180 --> 36:20.180
Is that when the new desktop

36:21.060 --> 36:24.460
You can use the new desktop on ten dot o dot one as a beta

36:24.460 --> 36:29.860
But I doubt it'll be ready in time ten dot one is like three months away at most. Oh, man

36:29.860 --> 36:33.940
I'm it'll come out. It'll come out probably around the end of October beginning in November

36:33.940 --> 36:38.020
I'm pretty interested to see what they do with that. It's all QT based you talked to

36:38.020 --> 36:40.020
I

36:46.820 --> 36:53.340
Think it's a little fancier. I think it's a little smoother Q5 sis was talking about it when he went to self. Okay

36:56.100 --> 36:59.160
Yeah, he talked to Chris's brother who's working on it and it's all QT

36:59.780 --> 37:04.060
Sounds from what I've heard and I don't know. I think I might have saw a little tease of it

37:04.060 --> 37:09.140
It looked pretty impressive like way more polished than I was expecting for something this early on

37:09.700 --> 37:16.180
Imagine PCB SD man, it lands with ZFS out of the box. This brand new QT desktop is pretty it's pretty nice

37:16.180 --> 37:18.240
Right like PBI system

37:18.860 --> 37:19.900
Starting to get pretty serious

37:19.900 --> 37:26.580
You you won't really need the PB eyes unless you specifically want portable apps because the package manager in previous D has gotten so awesome

37:26.580 --> 37:29.260
Now that you just use it. Well, there you go

37:29.260 --> 37:36.460
But that's why PBI has been reformatted to be more like the Apple dmg's because the need for them is basically been supplanted by

37:36.660 --> 37:40.540
The awesome work and now you know what Chris needs to do Chris Moore

37:40.540 --> 37:46.080
He needs to mail Gabe at valve a PCB SD rig with a nice video card in it so we can get native. Yes

37:46.460 --> 37:51.900
Yeah, yeah, we're working with the 64-bit Linux you later to be able to just run the Linux version. Yeah

37:52.540 --> 37:54.540
There you go. Yeah

37:54.540 --> 37:59.500
Already have better than make some video drivers. Oh snaps. Here we go. So

38:00.340 --> 38:07.380
Speaking of snaps. Do you guys remember one of the early canonical controversies before the dashboard before unity?

38:08.100 --> 38:12.960
Before buttons got moved to the left. Do you remember what we used to always get on canonical sack about?

38:12.960 --> 38:18.880
Do you remember what the big controversy was what fucking Brown? Well the brown? Yeah, that's true. That is one of them

38:18.880 --> 38:24.600
What could brown do for you? Yeah, no, but no actual controversial like canonical hates freedom because of they're doing this

38:24.680 --> 38:27.040
It was a big upset. You ready anybody?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.320
I'll give you a hint

38:29.320 --> 38:36.200
It's something that the canonical project uses that no other open source project used at the time, but now it's a little more popular. Oh

38:37.360 --> 38:41.560
What is it? I don't want to say launchpad. No, you're close those landscape

38:43.120 --> 38:46.860
Landscape yeah landscape was the big upset. Well five years ago

38:46.860 --> 38:51.940
I landscape this it's sort of like it's a bug tracker. It's a forum. It's a issue

38:51.940 --> 38:55.460
It's all this stuff in one, you know, like go here. Here's the public

38:55.460 --> 38:59.660
It's sort of like a everything host, you know, it's much better than all of that that we're moving towards

39:00.820 --> 39:02.820
fabricator

39:04.340 --> 39:08.420
It actually came out of Facebook, but the guy that created at Facebook spun it off in its own company

39:09.060 --> 39:10.980
We're still using we just moved to bugzilla

39:10.980 --> 39:16.260
So we're not gonna adopt it but it's a code review tool that also has bug tracker and a wiki and community and all this

39:16.260 --> 39:21.940
Cool stuff, but just the way it handles code review and stuff makes it very very valuable for any open source project

39:23.580 --> 39:29.820
So the they actually open sourced the code five years ago. They were under a free software. Actually, let's go

39:29.820 --> 39:32.940
Look at that announcement q5 is by the way, a lot of the stuff we're talking about. Mr

39:32.940 --> 39:34.940
Sis has linked us up in the show notes

39:35.060 --> 39:37.900
So I was trying to remember I don't think they did GPL though

39:38.060 --> 39:43.580
So it was still kind of an upset on this article doesn't say what the license was. That's too bad. That's too bad

39:43.580 --> 39:49.580
It links to something else, but I do remember that being a big moment. Okay, moving on you ready for this one?

39:50.820 --> 39:56.460
Amazon fails in its irony detection. I thought this is interesting as Linux users and polls George R

39:56.540 --> 39:57.580
Orwell's

39:57.580 --> 40:03.780
1984 directly out of Kindle ebooks that readers already had purchased you remember when they did this I wasn't a kid

40:03.780 --> 40:07.100
I'm still not a Kindle user really but it was a big controversy. Yeah

40:07.100 --> 40:12.220
Well, it was the publisher that made them do it for a reason wasn't I forget? Yeah. Yeah

40:12.220 --> 40:14.420
Yeah, but they were getting sued but yes

40:14.420 --> 40:17.540
It kind of it showed that you could buy something and then have it unbought

40:17.540 --> 40:22.660
Well, and the thing was in the Linux community back then we were really grappling with DRM

40:22.660 --> 40:24.860
What did all this DRM mean for Linux users?

40:25.140 --> 40:28.540
should we as Linux users reject all things DRM and

40:29.140 --> 40:31.140
this was sort of the

40:31.580 --> 40:36.860
Like the key thing that all the anti DRM group which obviously it doesn't take much of the anti DRM

40:36.860 --> 40:43.580
that that group would say look this is the perfect example of why DRM is a bad thing and the free software foundation jumped on

40:43.580 --> 40:48.680
It and then you started to hear the swindle. That's where swindle came from was after this. That's where they coined the swindle term

40:49.660 --> 40:50.580
It was huge

40:50.580 --> 40:55.940
We talked about on the Linux action show even though it's not particularly Linux related because Linux users were so impacted by it

40:55.940 --> 41:03.140
Mm-hmm, which I thought was I don't know. I I yeah, I remember that I remember going yeah, and I went back to reading my Kindle

41:03.140 --> 41:05.140
Yeah

41:05.140 --> 41:10.020
Like yeah, well, you know that sucks, but I mean it didn't affect me personally. I'm really selfish that way

41:10.020 --> 41:14.500
I don't know why but it's like wow, it's not affecting me directly. I I just don't care

41:14.500 --> 41:18.880
I I'm not really I'm not feeling the pain point that the other folks are feeling I guess well and also

41:18.980 --> 41:24.680
You know you and I come down to it now because this the debate has been sort of reignited with steam games having DRM in

41:24.680 --> 41:31.080
Them and well and Netflix if you want Netflix, it's gonna be HTML 5 a DRM, right, right and to me all of these things

41:31.080 --> 41:38.480
They they fall into a category of like casual entertainment like as much as right like the same category that going to a movie

41:38.860 --> 41:42.880
Falls into I don't get all worked up that I only go to see a movie once

41:42.880 --> 41:45.560
But I still have pain like 30 bucks when I go to the theater to me

41:45.560 --> 41:47.820
It is you know if you want it well

41:47.820 --> 41:50.880
Well if you try to bring a backpack and they say well yeah

41:50.880 --> 41:53.660
I feel differently sure they want to make sure that you don't record it

41:54.000 --> 41:58.740
Listen the monkey wants to punch a button and have his entertainment and if they want to charge me a certain amount that is fair

41:58.740 --> 42:03.520
Then the monkey will pay that amount and if the monkeys entertainment is wrapped up in a controlling scheme

42:03.520 --> 42:06.960
It doesn't really matter because to be honest with you the monkey has a short attention span

42:06.960 --> 42:12.440
And he's gonna move on to something else anyways and just because the monkey has a predilection to collect everything and hoard everything

42:12.560 --> 42:14.880
Like some sort of squirrel preparing for the winter

42:14.880 --> 42:21.240
It doesn't necessarily actually mean that is the thing you should be doing and perhaps maybe not having so much digital clutter is actually a good

42:21.240 --> 42:23.460
Thing that's what the monkey thinks at least here's the other thing to you

42:23.460 --> 42:29.000
So your your end goal or the the end goal or the the end idea would be that we'd all be able to use games

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
On any platform we wanted and they would all years

42:31.000 --> 42:33.200
I could shut down ten years and they would all be there

42:33.200 --> 42:35.200
I'm free but the reality is in order to get there

42:35.200 --> 42:41.840
We have to take small bites small steps and the first step is to be able to actually run the games on Linux later after

42:41.840 --> 42:46.640
We have all the software working and Linux becomes a usable platform for the majority of people then we can worry about

42:47.360 --> 42:52.660
Finding better solutions that are more free, but at this point. I feel like the fact that steams on Linux at all yeah

42:52.660 --> 42:56.780
Let's stop there. That's a huge right that for a year or two before we start complaining. Yeah

42:56.780 --> 42:58.860
I think you know we're talking about five years ago. You go back five years

42:59.700 --> 43:04.320
Nobody would have believed where I gave me now nobody it's unbelievable where we're at now

43:04.320 --> 43:07.820
I mean just the fact we're talking about x-plane. I'm playing freaking x-plane, and it's awesome

43:07.820 --> 43:12.740
I think x-plane I could be wrong on this, but I think x-plane actually had stronger Linux support

43:12.740 --> 43:15.100
Yeah, because the flight schools all run Linux no

43:15.100 --> 43:18.460
I know, but I'm just saying like there's these quality of games now right except five years ago

43:18.460 --> 43:23.880
I'll just blow my mind that we have now. I remember like when y'all were making fun of her on it

43:23.880 --> 43:26.060
We're always recording on being coming to run it

43:27.220 --> 43:29.220
This will never happen

43:29.660 --> 43:34.500
Actually, I think I actually kind of gave him a little I was coming down on the bit of I might believe it

43:34.500 --> 43:38.540
I was starting after a while. There's a saying in the news business where there's enough smoke

43:38.540 --> 43:40.900
There's probably a fire and it started to see like there's a lot of smoke

43:40.900 --> 43:45.300
Here's something like Veronica like a report something like nobody would believe it

43:45.800 --> 43:46.440
Well, yeah

43:46.440 --> 43:52.800
Cuz they were pulling what he was doing early on where Michael got onto it early on this is probably about two three years ago

43:53.320 --> 43:59.120
Was he was finding like like screenshots or something in the windows binary or something like he was taking stuff apart

43:59.280 --> 44:02.200
Or like the installer and finding references to Linux

44:02.200 --> 44:06.960
That's how it started and everybody was like they just explained it away as oh that was just for some testing stuff

44:06.960 --> 44:11.080
I don't pay any attention to that valve doesn't even have a Linux developer on staff

44:11.080 --> 44:13.740
That's what everybody was saying. They don't even have any developers in staff

44:22.840 --> 44:25.080
Sorry go no you go you go

44:26.000 --> 44:29.640
I was gonna say I'm sure there was a period where Michael was saying that he was

44:29.920 --> 44:32.640
Going into valves offices and talking to them about it

44:32.640 --> 44:40.720
But that he wasn't allowed to relay exactly what he was talking about, you know to anyone but just simply going it is happening

44:40.720 --> 44:45.560
I promise you I've gone in and seen it, but I can't show you any kind of real proof or anything like that

44:46.120 --> 44:52.580
Right. Yeah, that's always people, you know, then that depends on your reputation and everybody has a different interpretation of that

44:52.760 --> 44:57.320
Hey, so we're working on more retro look back. So we're just getting started. This is just a new concept

44:57.320 --> 45:02.800
We came up with our episode 50. Let's let's celebrate our 50th episode by doing just a little look back over

45:02.960 --> 45:05.480
The history of Linux and we want to do one next month too

45:05.480 --> 45:11.080
So if something happened a few years ago in August that you thinks was a sentimental moment or maybe even not just something that's fun

45:11.080 --> 45:13.080
To talk about in the Linux space

45:13.280 --> 45:17.840
Email us go over to Jupiter broadcasting comm click the contact link and send it into Linux unplugged

45:17.840 --> 45:20.480
You might see it in next month's retro look back

45:20.480 --> 45:22.600
We're gonna try to do this from time to time if you guys like it

45:22.600 --> 45:24.800
So you got to let us know because you're the boss

45:24.800 --> 45:30.120
Hey before we get to the end of the show and I got I got a little question and maybe a problem the audience can

45:30.120 --> 45:33.120
Help me solve. I know our audience. I know somebody out

45:33.120 --> 45:38.560
There is a Thunderbird user who is empowered to solve my problem and it's a big problem. What's the problem?

45:38.560 --> 45:43.360
Well, I'm gonna tell you after the ad spot cuz first I'm gonna talk about Linux Academy another problem that Linux Academy solves

45:43.560 --> 45:48.880
Are you busy? Are you a busy person like me and are you sometimes wondering if you're in the right groove?

45:48.880 --> 45:52.240
Are you working on the right product? Are you doing the right type of technology?

45:52.240 --> 45:56.640
Do you should get into web services should you get into OpenStack or virtualization?

45:56.960 --> 46:01.840
Do you want to just kind of see how other distributions work or do you want to take your skills to the next level?

46:01.840 --> 46:03.840
Well, then go over to linuxacademy.com

46:04.240 --> 46:06.880
Unplugged that'll get you the summer of learning discount

46:06.880 --> 46:11.040
This is a great opportunity to take your skills to the next level make you more employable

46:11.360 --> 46:18.760
Make that next review have an extra checkmark that said you accomplish this thing or give yourself the opportunity to expand your skills

46:18.760 --> 46:23.760
Like take Noah here. He's a Red Hat guy. Let's say he got thrust into the Ubuntu world

46:23.760 --> 46:31.600
Well, one of the great things about linuxacademy.com is you have seven plus Linux distributions to choose from whichever distribution you choose the courseware

46:31.760 --> 46:38.560
Automatically adjust to that distribution. They have comprehensive study guides that you can download mp3s video. They have self-paced courses

46:38.560 --> 46:39.560
You see exactly where you at

46:39.560 --> 46:41.200
So if you you work for maybe a half hour

46:41.200 --> 46:44.200
You'll log off for the night you come back a couple of days later

46:44.200 --> 46:47.640
You can resume right where you're at you see your percentage if you feel like you need to double-check yourself

46:47.640 --> 46:51.360
They have self-testing a community that will keep you motivated and on the right track

46:51.360 --> 46:56.640
And if you go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you'll get that 33% discount

46:56.640 --> 47:01.400
That's $50 a quarter and they're adding new stuff every single week new AWS courses

47:01.400 --> 47:07.360
If you got an AWS gig coming up go do a scenario based lesson on it learn by actually deploying a web-based

47:07.800 --> 47:12.400
AWS application and on the back end they'll spin up the virtual machines for you. Now. Here's a question

47:12.400 --> 47:15.000
Do they have instructors that you can ask questions? Oh, yeah

47:15.000 --> 47:19.360
They've got they've got a full crew and they've also started recently doing like live sessions

47:19.360 --> 47:24.280
So you can go there and ask questions and interact with them and then they'll make the video available if you weren't able to attend

47:24.280 --> 47:28.720
The live session later on so it's a really cool like back and forth and it gives you an opportunity to ask because they're real

47:28.720 --> 47:29.000
You know

47:29.000 --> 47:32.640
They're educators when I when I first started when I first started doing professional training

47:32.640 --> 47:37.360
One of the things that really bothered me was I had to block off an entire week of work

47:37.520 --> 47:38.560
To go do this

47:38.560 --> 47:42.120
And then the other thing was to is because you were in a classroom full of other students

47:42.120 --> 47:47.400
You would ask the structure a question and he would tell you, you know, go grow up a man page. That's not really helpful

47:47.400 --> 47:49.400
No, it's not is it?

47:49.400 --> 47:51.320
No, I can do that at home and send it

47:51.320 --> 47:56.040
You know an email in and then get a response and then read that when I have time and move on that's appealing one

47:56.040 --> 47:59.580
Of the things I found that I've really liked with my subscription is I hear about something new and it's like well

47:59.580 --> 48:04.640
Why don't I just go jump in for a half hour and see how much of this technology I grok and see if I have an

48:04.640 --> 48:09.680
Innate talent for it and it's really cool because I don't have to spend the time of setting up the VM

48:09.680 --> 48:13.720
Loading the software stack and all that's like when I just I just go through the course material

48:13.720 --> 48:15.720
I get the fundamentals and when it comes to that spot

48:15.880 --> 48:19.580
They manage that part for me and what's awesome is if that's on AWS

48:19.640 --> 48:24.160
They're covering all the cost of that too. So I'm not paying out of pocket while I'm learning AWS

48:24.160 --> 48:28.160
I just go right over to linuxacademy.com slash dumb plug get the summer of learning discount

48:28.160 --> 48:30.320
This is a great sponsor for our network

48:30.320 --> 48:32.320
I'd love to have you guys support them because I

48:32.560 --> 48:38.040
They're an independent team who have built this system from scratch and we're an independent team who have built our system from scratch

48:38.040 --> 48:43.760
and it's really cool for us to be able to connect together and work together in a common area like this linuxacademy.com slash

48:45.360 --> 48:52.200
Well Noah you're here and you sent in that awesome runs Linux from the radio station. I'm glad you enjoyed it

48:52.200 --> 48:54.900
It's at the benchmark man. You set the benchmark, you know

48:54.900 --> 48:59.040
I've been making a call to have people send in their runs Linux like a YouTube you did a perfect

48:59.040 --> 49:05.280
Yeah, you took the YouTube you took a video you uploaded it to YouTube sent in the link and or you submitted to the subreddit

49:05.280 --> 49:08.200
I did. Yeah, even better because I'm more likely to see it than email. Yeah

49:08.760 --> 49:14.200
That worked really well. Honestly, I didn't I've given up with you an email and I like completely yeah, totally

49:14.200 --> 49:16.200
That's right. You've got other methods

49:24.480 --> 49:26.480
I'm trying to help after all

49:27.160 --> 49:31.600
I don't know. I think I mentioned in the show, but did you edit that on your pixel?

49:31.600 --> 49:36.300
Uh, no, okay. I have a production rig, but you know on Ubuntu though. Yes. Yep

49:40.880 --> 49:44.800
No, but everything everything from start to finish was done on Linux

49:45.120 --> 49:51.120
Even even even the glass that everyone likes so much even that at its core is technically running Linux. That's true. That's true

49:51.720 --> 49:56.120
Very nice. How is it working with light words? I know you've been doing it more and more. Yeah, it's we actually switch

49:56.120 --> 49:59.520
So we do professional video editing and we actually we just switched

49:59.520 --> 50:04.600
Well, actually a couple months ago, but we switched to all light works based and on Linux. So yeah

50:05.360 --> 50:11.200
There's no longer any proprietary. Well proprietary operating systems running. Yeah, they call it open source, but it's really not

50:12.000 --> 50:16.840
It's a very liberal, but you get to use it on top of Linux. Yeah, which is what I care about, right? Yeah

50:16.920 --> 50:21.680
Yeah, I've got light works installed here on the bonobo and I've been doing a couple of custom projects here and there on it

50:21.680 --> 50:25.160
But I just haven't gotten enough time in it. It's a pretty big change up from what I'm used to

50:25.160 --> 50:30.680
I'm come from a previous editor. I did I so when I went when I went to school for for for broadcasting

50:30.680 --> 50:33.200
We used obviously Final Cut. Yeah, and then when I was done

50:33.200 --> 50:36.960
I spent half my time in Adobe Premiere and half my time in Sony Vegas and

50:37.560 --> 50:39.560
Between the two I didn't really have

50:39.680 --> 50:44.920
And when I went to light works it like I swear some developer at edit share sat down where they're like

50:45.160 --> 50:48.200
What is the most confusing way we could lay out a GUI?

50:48.200 --> 50:52.520
Yeah people to use and then right they made it a little more complicated and then that's what they went with because it doesn't work

50:52.520 --> 50:59.520
Like any other NLE out there. No, but once you get in the way of light works editing, I wouldn't go back really

50:59.520 --> 51:03.760
Oh, absolutely. Oh that gives me some encouragement. It's I look at it almost like an operating system

51:03.760 --> 51:08.480
Well, it's neat is because it like takes over your screen. Yeah, it doesn't matter if you're using it on Windows Mac or Linux

51:09.120 --> 51:10.720
Everything else that applies

51:10.720 --> 51:16.240
Dig that thing is for me is it's so different and I don't necessarily think it's different in a good way

51:16.240 --> 51:19.000
Yeah, it was hard for me. Yeah, it was one of those things too

51:19.000 --> 51:23.640
I walked away from the computer two or three times and I went that's it. I'm done. Never going back. I'm not using this

51:23.640 --> 51:28.200
Really? Yeah, it took a while. Oh, man. Yeah, I'm a little conflicted

51:28.200 --> 51:32.240
But I'm gonna what I figure is I'll just keep working on like little projects that I just don't like it's not critical that

51:32.240 --> 51:36.120
if things go wrong and that's fine, and I'll just keep poking away at it over time and

51:36.920 --> 51:39.840
We'll see I'll give you guys a report. Maybe I'll do a review soon

51:39.840 --> 51:44.320
Hey before we wrap I wanted to ask and I'll ask the mumble room in the post show

51:44.320 --> 51:46.320
But I wanted to ask you out there in the audience

51:46.320 --> 51:48.960
What are your tricks to work with Thunderbird?

51:48.960 --> 51:49.760
Because you know

51:49.760 --> 51:54.600
I am serious about this fortress Chris and I think one of the things is when I move off of Google apps for Jupiter broadcasting

51:54.600 --> 51:56.880
I'm probably gonna be using Thunderbird primarily

51:56.960 --> 52:01.200
The other reason I want to use Thunderbird is I really dig the GPG encryption

52:01.440 --> 52:04.880
Plugin tools and I want to get more into that too. And so the two go hand in hand

52:05.560 --> 52:10.680
But there's a few things I have that bother me about Thunderbird and you got to keep in mind

52:10.680 --> 52:17.680
I'm trying to use it at a scale where maybe each inbox is getting 50 to 120 emails a day

52:17.680 --> 52:22.040
And maybe there's four or five inboxes. So it's it's it's at a scale where you need to build a process

52:22.040 --> 52:24.040
So my question for the audience is is what?

52:24.400 --> 52:29.640
Extensions what tips and tricks do you have themes anything to make Thunderbird rock?

52:29.640 --> 52:33.120
And I know some of you're gonna be like Thunderbird rock that doesn't even make any sense

52:33.120 --> 52:35.640
But if you're using it, you know what I mean? What do you do to make a rock?

52:35.640 --> 52:39.100
Do you have any do you use Thunderbird anything? Oh, yeah, that's all yeah

52:39.100 --> 52:43.120
That's my email flight what them I'll tell you the main bugaboo and I'll ask the mumble post show

52:43.120 --> 52:50.680
But the main bugaboo for me, this is huge dude for me is in Gmail and outlook you get in the actual message list

52:50.680 --> 52:52.960
I'm not talking the preview box. I'm talking in the message list

52:52.960 --> 52:55.540
You get like a one or three line preview of the email

52:55.540 --> 52:56.040
Sure

52:56.040 --> 53:01.600
and the reason why that's critical is because you can get a quick sense of what the email might be about without clicking it and

53:01.600 --> 53:06.840
Thus marking it red because of course my system is if it's red that's processed if it's unread it's not processed

53:06.840 --> 53:10.920
So if I click something just to get a sense of what it's about and I don't want to respond to at that moment

53:10.920 --> 53:13.600
I will never go back to it again because it's now marked red. Mm-hmm

53:13.600 --> 53:17.240
I swear there used to be a way in Thunderbird to get that preview

53:17.240 --> 53:18.160
I swear

53:18.160 --> 53:22.680
So I just want to get tips and tricks and I might do like a little collection on the Linux action show of things

53:22.680 --> 53:25.040
I did to make Thunderbird work well for me going back

53:25.040 --> 53:30.520
So snake doc says that Thunderbirds capable of it. I know yeah, I think so too, but I can't figure out how well

53:30.520 --> 53:33.720
Apparently snake doc does know how well snake doc smarter than I am. Yeah

53:33.720 --> 53:39.460
Yeah, maybe you could do a team viewer sessions and and and system administrate your computer. That'd be a great idea

53:39.560 --> 53:41.560
What could go wrong with that, right?

53:42.360 --> 53:43.440
Hey

53:43.440 --> 53:49.320
So I I'm gonna be out at OSCON well with Noah and Eric and while I'm gone Tuesday and Wednesday

53:49.320 --> 53:53.460
I've I've pre-taped two episodes of tech talk today Tuesday's episode is great

53:53.460 --> 53:55.440
We've got some Tesla security information in there

53:55.440 --> 54:02.200
Which is actually Linux related and some really deep dive into like the dirty details of some of the Google quarterly results

54:02.200 --> 54:07.840
But on Wednesday, this is the one you guys are gonna want to tune into tech talk today on Wednesday is a retrospective

54:07.840 --> 54:15.480
look back at the birth the humble beginnings of the internet and from ARPANET up to the proto podcaster we take about a

54:15.960 --> 54:20.520
About a 15 year span of the early humble beginnings of the internet and just go deep dive into that

54:20.520 --> 54:23.320
It turned out to be such a fun episode. That'll be out on Wednesday

54:23.320 --> 54:28.500
I think it's gonna be episode 31 of tech talk today. So go check that out. I think you guys really like it

55:06.400 --> 55:08.160
We want to chew on it spit it up

55:08.160 --> 55:12.560
Gurgitate it and then put it back into your ear hole kind of like a mom to her baby birds

55:12.560 --> 55:14.560
But instead of their mouth their ear holes

55:15.520 --> 55:17.520
Yeah, it's an interesting analogy. Yeah

55:22.080 --> 55:27.280
All right, well I know thanks for joining us in studio today thanks for having it was it was great having you here

55:27.280 --> 55:31.160

55:31.160 --> 55:35.720
I'll have OSCON stories for you. Okay, sweet. All right. I'll see you then all right everyone

55:35.720 --> 56:05.040
Thanks so much for to this week's episode of Linux unplugged. We'll see you right back here next Tuesday

56:05.720 --> 56:07.720
I

56:26.320 --> 56:30.360
Already got a tip from the chat room about the fun the Thunderbird thing, but it didn't work

56:30.360 --> 56:34.640
I went to the message pane and I checked the message message pane thing layout

56:34.640 --> 56:37.760
It's I hear I'll show you here's what my Thunderbird inbox looks like right now

56:37.760 --> 56:43.560
So if you're watching this, this is my Thunderbird inbox and see what I want is in the list here in this list

56:43.560 --> 56:44.880
I want it's like a three

56:44.880 --> 56:49.800
I want each basically each mail item to take up an extra couple of rows and give me inline previews a little bit

56:49.800 --> 56:51.800
That's what I want

56:52.160 --> 56:57.640
Like gmail does gmail does I swear Thunderbird used to do that guy's email doesn't do that sure it does yeah

56:57.640 --> 57:04.640
I know but what I would say there is a couple things. Um, I do you like the wide

57:05.480 --> 57:10.760
I'm sure I was trying it. Yeah, I bounce around the wide one is just for people that were coming from I look

57:11.680 --> 57:12.520
Yeah, yeah

57:12.520 --> 57:15.680
I just was trying it to see if I turned it on because I know outlook has that mode

57:16.120 --> 57:22.280
Like I used the threaded thing instead and you know when I like half my screen is a message preview

57:22.280 --> 57:27.280
Although I I work the same way you do with the market is red except I have my setting is don't mark

57:27.280 --> 57:31.100
The email is red until I actually mark it mark it that might be a way to do it

57:31.100 --> 57:35.960
I suppose there's also an option to just say don't mark it in red unless I've read it for at least 30 seconds

57:37.080 --> 57:43.280
Yeah, maybe that's why I hate that setting sometimes because sometimes I don't but sometimes I want to just click it

57:43.280 --> 57:46.120
And I also want to mark it red really but I could just do the markers red button

57:46.120 --> 57:48.120
I might try just change it up like that

57:48.120 --> 57:51.120
What I do is your screens not so

57:53.560 --> 57:56.680
But on mine in the list of messages

57:56.680 --> 58:02.600
There's a little green circle a little green light beside each message and if you just click the light it marks it. Yeah, that's true

58:02.600 --> 58:08.480
Yeah, I can turn that you know what I like about you over over users that I support is when you say I have problem

58:08.480 --> 58:09.480
a if I go

58:09.480 --> 58:13.600
We'll change your workflow to be and then you'll be able to do that. You're not like well, that's not what I asked you to fix

58:13.600 --> 58:18.320
I don't mind changing. Yeah, that's really helpful
