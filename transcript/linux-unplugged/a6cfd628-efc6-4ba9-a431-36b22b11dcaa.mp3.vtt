WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
Did you share those notes today there, Mr. Chris?

00:03.400 --> 00:04.400
Now, okay.

00:04.400 --> 00:05.400
What?

00:05.400 --> 00:06.400
There are no notes?

00:06.400 --> 00:07.400
Oh, beautiful.

00:07.400 --> 00:08.400
Beautiful.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.400
That's a good part to start the show right there then.

00:09.400 --> 00:26.680
This is Linux Unplugged episode 176 for December 20th, 2016.

00:26.680 --> 00:31.120
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's currently celebrating its

00:31.120 --> 00:33.680
last live production of the year.

00:33.680 --> 00:34.680
My name is Chris.

00:34.680 --> 00:35.680
My name is Wes.

00:35.680 --> 00:36.680
Hello, Wes.

00:36.680 --> 00:40.660
There is a tradition on the Jupiter Broadcasting Network that we don't always choose to take

00:40.660 --> 00:44.000
advantage of, but from time to time, and I feel like this is the year we're going to

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
do it.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh, yeah.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.800
No rules shows, the last live show.

00:47.800 --> 00:48.800
Anything could happen.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.800
These are probably going to be awful, and so it's why we never do it like this.

00:51.800 --> 00:57.040
We never do it like this, but if there was any show to go, no rules, no prep, it's this

00:57.040 --> 00:58.040
show.

00:58.040 --> 01:03.000
And it kind of worked out, because I have this debilitating carpal tunnel in both my

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
hands right now.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Oh, no.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.140
I don't mean to be laughing.

01:06.140 --> 01:07.140
It's the worst thing ever.

01:07.140 --> 01:08.140
The only way to deal.

01:08.140 --> 01:09.140
Yeah, it is.

01:09.140 --> 01:13.120
I can't even lift up the bowl of cereal or put my seatbelt on.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.600
So I thought, well, what a great day not to have to put a dock together.

01:15.600 --> 01:16.600
Yeah, right?

01:16.600 --> 01:17.600
No typing.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.720
What a great excuse to just not worry about it.

01:19.720 --> 01:23.760
So coming up on this week's episode, we're going to throw out the playbook.

01:23.760 --> 01:26.340
We're going to look at the worst of 2016.

01:26.340 --> 01:28.280
What was the worst in Linux in 2016?

01:28.280 --> 01:30.560
We're going to talk about some of that.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.040
Then we're going to look forward to 2017.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.200
Jack Wallins got an article that actually got me thinking about what might be coming

01:35.200 --> 01:36.240
down the pipe.

01:36.240 --> 01:40.480
Not a full-fledged predictions episode, but I want to give the virtual lug a chance to

01:40.480 --> 01:44.200
chime in before we sail into 2017.

01:44.200 --> 01:50.980
And then, at the end of the show, like a maniac, I'm going to hand the reins over to Noah,

01:50.980 --> 01:56.520
and he's going to answer some calls and chat small business and GNU slash Linux.

01:56.520 --> 01:57.520
I've heard of that.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.520
Yeah, it's new.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.520
And they're going to talk about it on the phone.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.080
You can just get in there and take calls.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.880
So why don't we get started by bringing in that virtual lug?

02:04.880 --> 02:06.880
Hello, Mama Robe.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.880
Hello, hello.

02:08.880 --> 02:12.040
Hello, hello, hello.

02:12.040 --> 02:17.560
And hey, guys, thanks for being here on our last episode of the year.

02:17.560 --> 02:23.240
It's not really the last one, because tomorrow or next Tuesday, we'll have a clip show of

02:23.240 --> 02:26.240
all the different stuff throughout the year, which is a great one, by the way.

02:26.240 --> 02:30.880
If you want to spread Linux Unplugged for the holidays, toss them a clip show.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
You know it's going to be good.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.280
It's all your favorite moments.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.920
It's going to be passable, though.

02:34.920 --> 02:35.920
I'm kidding.

02:35.920 --> 02:36.920
It's going to be good.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.040
You won't hate yourself after.

02:38.040 --> 02:42.200
The beard's been sprinkling his beard magic all over it.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.360
Yeah, so I didn't want to have any rules.

02:44.360 --> 02:49.440
I wanted to let the mumble room and the conversation go any direction it goes.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.800
So I thought I'd kind of cue us up with a couple of things.

02:51.800 --> 02:55.660
And then I'm going to do the reads for all the sponsors here in a minute.

02:55.660 --> 02:57.360
Just do them all right here at the top of the show.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.360
All right.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.360
And we're just going to do them.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.680
And then however long the show goes, it goes.

03:01.680 --> 03:02.680
And we're going to call it good.

03:02.680 --> 03:03.680
We're going to call it good.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.200
Hey, check in with Grand Forks, North Dakota.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.200
Noah, are you on the line?

03:06.200 --> 03:07.200
Are you there?

03:07.200 --> 03:08.200
Yes, sir.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.200
Over.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.200
Over.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.200
Mr. Chris.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.200
That might be a bit excessive.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.400
I may be on my phone, but I don't think we have to I don't think we have to have like

03:14.400 --> 03:16.800
a transition of speaking and thinking.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.440
I think we can handle that.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.440
Over.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.440
10-4 good, buddy.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.440
Yeah.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.440
10-4, Noah.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.440
Get out the telegraph.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.440
Get out the telegraph.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.440
Come on, Noah.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.440
So what's going on over there?

03:26.440 --> 03:28.800
Are you are you getting set up to take calls here in a little bit on the show?

03:28.800 --> 03:33.200
Well, I spent I spent a little bit of time getting some levels tweaked and getting some

03:33.200 --> 03:34.200
equipment set up.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.760
I'm actually on my phone because I've used up all of my audio interfaces in the studio

03:36.760 --> 03:39.520
and I don't want to monkey with any of the levels, but.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.520
Oh, my God.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.520
Okay.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.520
All right.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.520
Good.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.520
Well, it's setting the bar high.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.240
So what we're going to do is we're going to shut down production at some point and then

03:47.240 --> 03:51.720
do a quick little swap-a-roo and bring up Grand Forks.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.720
Hold on a second.

03:52.720 --> 03:53.720
Where's my here?

03:53.720 --> 03:57.600
Let's this is just something that I just so we have the context in which Noah is working

03:57.600 --> 03:58.600
right now.

03:58.600 --> 04:02.520
I feel like it'd be useful for us to know what's the temperature in Grand Forks, North

04:02.520 --> 04:04.080
Dakota right now.

04:04.080 --> 04:09.200
It's twenty nine degrees in Grand Forks right now.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.200
Not bad.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.200
No.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.200
No.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.200
Geez.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.200
Congratulations.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.400
No, I'm really happy for you, man.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.400
That's some good news.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.400
So, yeah.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.400
Okay.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.400
Good.

04:19.400 --> 04:20.400
I feel like we got a good show.

04:20.400 --> 04:21.400
We got a good show on our hands here today.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.480
I'm ready to dive into the worst of 2016.

04:23.480 --> 04:29.560
And I thought I had I had like I think what I want to do is I wanted I want to set the

04:29.560 --> 04:34.160
bar as to what I think was the worst thing that could have happened to a tech company

04:34.160 --> 04:35.160
in 2016.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.520
And then we want to talk within the context of Linux about that.

04:37.520 --> 04:41.600
So I've got a couple of ideas, but I feel like once we really get the ball rolling,

04:41.600 --> 04:42.600
that's when we're going to get some stuff.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.640
So that'll probably be thanks to the Mumble Room.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.760
They'll probably be doing some of the heavy lifting there.

04:46.760 --> 04:47.760
But why don't we.

04:47.760 --> 04:48.760
So let's do this.

04:48.760 --> 04:49.760
Are you ready, Wes?

04:49.760 --> 04:50.760
Oh, I'm ready.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.840
Do you feel like you've bought you prepared your body for this?

04:52.840 --> 04:53.840
Well, we'll see.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.160
Well, there's only one way to find out.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.160
That's by doing.

04:56.160 --> 05:00.480
So let's thank the folks that sponsored this show all year long.

05:00.480 --> 05:04.080
And I really appreciate Linux Academy and I appreciate those of you who visited Linux

05:04.080 --> 05:08.980
Academy dot com slash unplugged this year or those of you who plan to soon Linux Academy

05:08.980 --> 05:10.780
dot com slash unplugged.

05:10.780 --> 05:15.000
That's where you go to sign up for a platform to train you all about Linux.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.880
And when you go to Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged, you can get a seven day free trial.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.200
Courseware is great.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.280
It's constantly being improved.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.520
The virtualization system is slick.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.920
They spin up these systems on demand when you need them.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.900
The servers match the distributions you've chosen for the courseware automatically.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.240
They have content availability planning.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.920
They have instructors you can speak to when you need actual human help.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.840
But hot off the presses right here, Wes.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.320
This week, got an email.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.080
I mean, I got a press announcement.

05:45.080 --> 05:48.900
No, it's just an email I got here from Anthony and he says, here's a couple of new courses

05:48.900 --> 05:51.960
we've got working on over at Linux Academy.

05:51.960 --> 05:55.080
Machine learning with Azure, PowerShell Essentials.

05:55.080 --> 05:59.640
Now this, these two first ones right here are fascinating to me because they are on

05:59.640 --> 06:02.440
Linux Academy's Linux platform.

06:02.440 --> 06:06.360
It's using these tools in combination with Linux, which that really, if that doesn't

06:06.360 --> 06:08.200
tell you 2016, right?

06:08.200 --> 06:09.680
It doesn't that the fact that Linux Academy.

06:09.680 --> 06:10.680
PowerShell on Linux.

06:10.680 --> 06:11.680
On Linux Academy.

06:11.680 --> 06:15.040
This is really, I mean, when I saw this, I thought, wow, Linux.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.880
And it also tells you how they stay up to date with what stuff people are actually looking

06:17.880 --> 06:18.880
for to learn.

06:18.880 --> 06:19.880
Right on the bulls.

06:19.880 --> 06:24.280
They also have launched their iOS and Android apps this year, which is a great way to train

06:24.280 --> 06:25.880
when you're on the go.

06:25.880 --> 06:29.120
And they're launching serverless concepts, which was cool because they started with a

06:29.120 --> 06:33.000
live stream where you can join the instructors from Linux Academy, a couple of different

06:33.000 --> 06:36.680
ones, as they discuss serverless concepts and get you started with that.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.640
They have new live labs to get you started with AWS.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.200
This is one of the things I think is really great because it's not just the essentials.

06:42.200 --> 06:46.440
It's like the stuff that is really big high level services stuff like AWS and Azure and

06:46.440 --> 06:51.040
OpenStack and Docker and the things that, you know, look really great on a resume too.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.480
And they help you get those certifications you might need as well.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.840
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

06:55.840 --> 07:00.100
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.800
Also thank you to Ting for sponsoring the show this year.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.800
Wow.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.800
Linux.ting.com.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.800
I love being able to say that.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.800
Go there and save.

07:06.800 --> 07:11.080
You know, the reason why Ting has been a sponsor for so long on the show now is really simple

07:11.080 --> 07:14.480
economics.

07:14.480 --> 07:19.740
This kind of mobile model makes a lot of sense and our audience gets it.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.980
And so they keep going to Ting because it saves them money.

07:22.980 --> 07:26.520
And so because Ting keeps getting customers, they keep sponsoring us.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.000
Linux.ting.com.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.320
It's a great relationship because what we're trying to tell you about here isn't something

07:31.320 --> 07:32.360
that's some big scam.

07:32.360 --> 07:37.040
It's not some big complicated system or it's not some sort of incentive program where I

07:37.040 --> 07:40.640
undermine net neutrality but I do it with a leather jacket so I tell you it's cool.

07:40.640 --> 07:45.360
It is a really good mobile carrier that has CDMA and GSM networks.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.520
You pick which one works better for you and you pay for what you use.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.480
Minutes, messages, megabytes.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.480
Whatever you use, that's all you owe.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.840
And six dollars for the line plus Uncle Sam's take.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.360
Uncle Sam's got to have a little percentage.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.360
It varies in your area.

07:58.360 --> 07:59.520
He's got his hands in your pockets.

07:59.520 --> 08:03.140
But for me, it's usually almost always under 40 bucks.

08:03.140 --> 08:04.240
Almost always.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.960
Every now and then, like when I'm on the road or something like that, it might go up to

08:06.960 --> 08:10.280
55, 60 bucks for three phones.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.080
For three phones with no contract.

08:12.080 --> 08:13.080
I love it.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.120
You can bring a device or you can go grab one.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.600
Go to Linux.ting.com and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring.

08:18.600 --> 08:23.520
You see, when I say it like that, it changes it up.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.320
It's like a fresh new code.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.360
And if you weren't a long time listener, you might not have any idea what I'm saying.

08:29.360 --> 08:31.200
So it's only for the people in the know.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.480
Alright, and then our last sponsor and one that's also been with us all year and I'm

08:34.480 --> 08:37.440
super, super thankful to DigitalOcean.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.800
Now DigitalOcean, the one thing that you can really tell about DigitalOcean is it's just

08:41.800 --> 08:44.680
about everybody in our audience has a reason to use DigitalOcean.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.040
Charem's always talking about it.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.200
People write in the emails.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.960
We're not only reading the emails that talk about DigitalOcean or something like that.

08:49.960 --> 08:54.720
It's just what people are using because it's such a simple and fast and easy way to spin

08:54.720 --> 08:59.840
up a Linux system on their great infrastructure in less than 55 seconds.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.920
All SSDs for the storage, 40 gigabit e-connections to the hypervisors.

09:03.920 --> 09:04.920
They run Linux, of course.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.120
It's KVM for the virtualizer.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.400
I love that.

09:07.400 --> 09:13.920
And if you've ever wanted to see what a real nice web application can be to manage actual

09:13.920 --> 09:18.560
really high end server type things, DigitalOcean's got the proto example.

09:18.560 --> 09:22.680
You go there, it's like, oh, oh, they managed to put Johnny Ive in a box.

09:22.680 --> 09:25.920
They put Johnny Ive in a box and he spit out this interface and that's why Apple hasn't

09:25.920 --> 09:30.200
gotten anything for years now out of him because he's too busy working for DigitalOcean.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.040
It's the only thing that makes sense.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.440
Plus their API is built for humans.

09:34.440 --> 09:38.320
They really did something good here and there's so much crazy great open source built around

09:38.320 --> 09:39.720
that.

09:39.720 --> 09:40.720
Go check them out.

09:40.720 --> 09:45.120
DigitalOcean.com, just use a promo code from us for you.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.120
D-O-Unplugged.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.680
One word, lowercase, apply to your account after you get started or even if you had an

09:49.680 --> 09:54.320
account for a while, you get $10 credit.

09:54.320 --> 09:58.520
DigitalOcean.com, thanks for using the promo code D-O-Unplugged.

09:58.520 --> 10:06.140
Okay, now the rest of the show is open for however the conversation goes.

10:06.140 --> 10:10.080
So let's start talking about the worst of 2016.

10:10.080 --> 10:15.520
Now this next example is not Linux specific but I thought it set such a good benchmark.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.920
Like it can't get worse than this.

10:16.920 --> 10:21.280
So this is the worst, this is the very worst of 2016.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.280
Now the what?

10:22.280 --> 10:23.280
Go.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.280
I said go.

10:24.280 --> 10:25.280
Frightening headline about your smartphone.

10:25.280 --> 10:29.920
Samsung delaying shipments of its Galaxy Note 7 amid reports of exploding batteries and

10:29.920 --> 10:32.120
that announcement sending their stock plummeting.

10:32.120 --> 10:34.480
ABC's Rebecca Jarvis is here with the latest.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.480
Good morning, Rebecca.

10:35.480 --> 10:36.480
Good morning, Amy.

10:36.480 --> 10:41.040
Multiple consumers have now complained of explosions of their Galaxy Note 7 devices.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.040
Take a look at this.

10:42.040 --> 10:46.000
Some are sharing these pictures of their burnt out phones online.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.920
Samsung says that shipments are being delayed due to additional tests being conducted for

10:49.920 --> 10:54.480
product quality and there's no word on exactly what caused the problems.

10:54.480 --> 10:58.960
When you go to the airport today still, you hear warnings about how you can't bring a

10:58.960 --> 11:04.920
Note 7, a Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on the plane and it's played over the loudspeaker at the

11:04.920 --> 11:06.320
entire airport.

11:06.320 --> 11:07.320
That is embarrassing.

11:07.320 --> 11:11.200
There's no, I mean, Apple had a bad MacBook.

11:11.200 --> 11:15.400
There's a lot of stuff that hasn't come out of Google that we were hoping for.

11:15.400 --> 11:19.600
But nobody really had products that were blown up in your pockets like Samsung did.

11:19.600 --> 11:23.120
And what's interesting now is we do have kind of a picture of what happened.

11:23.120 --> 11:24.120
Did you hear about this?

11:24.120 --> 11:25.120
No.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.120
I'm behind the times.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.320
A third party contractor was brought in by Samsung to investigate what was causing the

11:29.320 --> 11:34.560
explosions and their analysis was is that Samsung left insufficient room for battery

11:34.560 --> 11:39.160
growth when the battery heats up, it expands and when the battery cools, it contracts.

11:39.160 --> 11:42.560
But when it's doing that super fast charging, it expands because it gets hot.

11:42.560 --> 11:46.920
And when it, I guess, part of what caused the problem is it would expand, breach, some

11:46.920 --> 11:51.020
sort of rupture happened and then I don't know, maybe, I don't know what happens from

11:51.020 --> 11:53.280
there that causes it to explode, but that was the core issue.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.280
Undefined behavior.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.280
Woo.

11:55.280 --> 11:58.720
And you know, Samsung, they just really didn't have a response out of the gate.

11:58.720 --> 11:59.720
No.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.720
No.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.760
It really did not feel like they were, you know, they didn't embrace it.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.520
They weren't out there already with the report.

12:04.520 --> 12:08.800
It took a long time to feel like they were really responding or trying to respond.

12:08.800 --> 12:09.800
Yeah.

12:09.800 --> 12:15.400
I tell you, that is, that is a, that is the worst case for a company like Samsung.

12:15.400 --> 12:21.980
And it, it allowed for like the Apple iPhone to essentially be totally lackluster without

12:21.980 --> 12:27.000
a headphone jack and still do very well because people are like, well, I'm done.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
I'm done with this.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
I'm sure Google was happy about that.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Yeah.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
The Pixel release.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.760
William just randomly wanted to jump in there and say hi, I think.

12:32.760 --> 12:33.760
So are you there, William?

12:33.760 --> 12:34.760
Are you good?

12:34.760 --> 12:35.760
Are you okay?

12:35.760 --> 12:36.760
Are you all right?

12:36.760 --> 12:37.760
I think something happened.

12:37.760 --> 12:38.760
We need you in 2017.

12:38.760 --> 12:39.760
Don't hurt yourself.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.760
I think something happened.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.760
I think somebody just busted in William's house.

12:41.760 --> 12:42.760
Are you okay?

12:42.760 --> 12:43.760
Are you all right?

12:43.760 --> 12:44.920
It was a Samsung Galaxy, though.

12:44.920 --> 12:45.920
I think so.

12:45.920 --> 12:46.920
Yep.

12:46.920 --> 12:47.920
Just exploded right there.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.920
Jeez.

12:48.920 --> 12:49.920
What a shame.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.360
So I want to transition from general technology and I want to, I don't really, it's not, I'm

12:52.360 --> 12:53.680
not here to talk about Samsung.

12:53.680 --> 12:54.680
You killed that show this year.

12:54.680 --> 12:55.680
Remember?

12:55.680 --> 12:56.680
That's right.

12:56.680 --> 12:57.680
Hey, where's the bell?

12:57.680 --> 12:58.680
Where are you?

12:58.680 --> 12:59.680
Come on, Wes.

12:59.680 --> 13:00.680
That's a...

13:00.680 --> 13:01.680
You're right.

13:01.680 --> 13:02.680
Bell worthy.

13:02.680 --> 13:03.680
That was bell worthy.

13:03.680 --> 13:07.120
Okay, I thought maybe we'd stop, we'd just stop right there and just talk Linux and talk

13:07.120 --> 13:09.480
worst of 2016.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.640
And I don't, I don't want this to be a bitch fest.

13:11.640 --> 13:15.700
This is just like, you know, this is in, this is kind of in good fun, really.

13:15.700 --> 13:16.700
It's in good fun.

13:16.700 --> 13:19.000
And there's, there are a few that we could start with.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.400
And I thought maybe to do that, we'd look at the 2017 list that Jack Wallen put together.

13:25.400 --> 13:29.640
Because this one jumped out at me right at the top.

13:29.640 --> 13:33.320
Canonical finally exits the phone market.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.440
He just went right for it.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.440
Wow.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.440
He says, I give Canonical credit.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.440
They tried hard.

13:37.440 --> 13:41.000
Unfortunately, Ubuntu phone missed the mark on nearly every possible level.

13:41.000 --> 13:45.080
The idea for interface was the idea for the interface was doomed from the beginning, speaking

13:45.080 --> 13:46.080
in past tense.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.080
Wow, yeah.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.080
In past tense here.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.800
And it couldn't gain any traction in the already saturated market.

13:50.800 --> 13:54.080
However, I do believe their dream of convergence can be fixed.

13:54.080 --> 13:58.200
And it begins with Android instead of focusing so much effort on getting Ubuntu phone in

13:58.200 --> 14:01.320
a position where it can make the convergence between desktop and mobile.

14:01.320 --> 14:05.360
Canonical might well sell their sites or I'm sorry, set their sites on integrating this

14:05.360 --> 14:08.600
functionality into Android.

14:08.600 --> 14:13.680
Regardless of what happens with convergence in 2017, we will see Canonical return their

14:13.680 --> 14:19.320
focus to what they do best the desktop and server market.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.560
What do you think of that?

14:20.560 --> 14:21.560
Is that too strong?

14:21.560 --> 14:22.560
Or do you?

14:22.560 --> 14:23.960
Boy, I don't know.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.240
It's not original, is it?

14:25.240 --> 14:29.120
This is not the first journalist in the Linux and open source.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.480
I think I saw these written in 2015.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.100
About 2016 to definitely, yeah.

14:34.100 --> 14:38.320
And I've seen other journalists say it for next year as well.

14:38.320 --> 14:43.320
And to some extent, it's true, because it's been announced that, you know, Canonical are

14:43.320 --> 14:48.560
stepping back from working on mobile devices to consolidate all of the work that's been

14:48.560 --> 14:51.300
done on unity eight around the desktop.

14:51.300 --> 14:54.440
So that will take some time.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.160
Whether or not there's another device this year, I don't know for mobile.

14:58.160 --> 15:02.520
But it's now bringing all of that work that happened in unit unity eight to the desktop.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.720
And everyone's working on that right now.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.720
Yeah.

15:05.720 --> 15:12.880
So to me, it feels a bit hollow, it feels to actually, here's a better way.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.200
But to me, it feels a bit cookie cutter.

15:15.200 --> 15:19.880
Like it's a it's a it's a cookie cutter argument that somebody else has already made a stencil

15:19.880 --> 15:24.040
for and you can stamp it out and you can mold it into your project or your article pretty

15:24.040 --> 15:25.040
easily.

15:25.040 --> 15:28.600
But what I'm trying to get at here is it feels like it sort of it sort of misses the mark

15:28.600 --> 15:32.240
on a couple of things in its analysis.

15:32.240 --> 15:39.720
First of all, it sort of seems to not acknowledge the work that mobile force canonical to think

15:39.720 --> 15:44.800
about like transactional updates, right and snap packages made a lot of the reason for

15:44.800 --> 15:47.680
for mirror right was involved with their mobile stuff.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.440
And also, I think the other thing that if canonical Oh, hold on, I'll come back to that

15:51.440 --> 15:52.440
because that mirror thing is a great point.

15:52.440 --> 15:57.440
I want to the other thing that I think that sort of it underplays is their their total

15:57.440 --> 16:07.480
refocusing and retooling around cutie are cute, which is going to long term make a huge,

16:07.480 --> 16:10.120
huge differentiator for the Unity desktop.

16:10.120 --> 16:14.760
Like it's going to be a it's going to be its own thing that developers will go after.

16:14.760 --> 16:20.920
It's going to be the Unity desktop is going to stand out from gnome and plasma, not because

16:20.920 --> 16:26.020
of the toolkit that it's using, but because it will not be like any other desktop.

16:26.020 --> 16:28.640
Unity seven already stands out as its own unique thing.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.920
But in most cases, it feels like a gnome desktop.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.560
It feels like a GTK environment.

16:32.560 --> 16:36.760
I believe once Unity eight is in a good usable spot on the desktop, and I don't know when

16:36.760 --> 16:37.760
that'll be.

16:37.760 --> 16:42.760
But when it arrives, I believe it will stand out as a completely, totally differentiating

16:42.760 --> 16:43.760
product.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.760
canonical going their own way.

16:44.760 --> 16:45.760
Yeah.

16:45.760 --> 16:46.760
And not in a bad way.

16:46.760 --> 16:47.760
No, not in a bad way.

16:47.760 --> 16:54.760
I think it really undersells the massive tide change that is happening, that it's only happening

16:54.760 --> 16:59.560
because of the work and investment in mobile.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.880
And I don't even think you necessarily kill off mobile, you just make it as part of a

17:02.880 --> 17:03.880
wider strategy.

17:03.880 --> 17:07.800
So you take the crap you've built to support that, and you integrate it with the wider

17:07.800 --> 17:09.900
product strategy.

17:09.900 --> 17:14.680
So that rather than pushing mobile mobile first, it's a hey, also mobile.

17:14.680 --> 17:20.400
It's a it's it's it's this tool set, this platform will work across this device range

17:20.400 --> 17:23.300
this it's because don't even think of it in hardware terms, think of it more in terms

17:23.300 --> 17:24.300
of screen size.

17:24.300 --> 17:28.200
That's what what do you think of that wimpy that way off the mark?

17:28.200 --> 17:30.960
Nope, no, it's not way off the mark at all.

17:30.960 --> 17:31.960
Yeah.

17:31.960 --> 17:32.960
Okay.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.560
So that's so that's the I think it's possible we could say they're exiting the phone market

17:35.560 --> 17:41.160
in terms of additional partnerships with your aggressive making a continuing aggressive

17:41.160 --> 17:42.160
partnerships with hardware.

17:42.160 --> 17:47.280
What to expect in the next I don't know if you can even say that all I know is that engineering

17:47.280 --> 17:52.380
is focused around putting everything that's happened in unity eight to the desktop right

17:52.380 --> 17:53.560
now.

17:53.560 --> 18:00.700
And as far as I know, the work on mobile has just been paused to allow that to happen.

18:00.700 --> 18:03.480
As in mobile software development has been paused.

18:03.480 --> 18:07.480
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that another device manufacturer couldn't come along, want to

18:07.480 --> 18:10.840
do a device and the platforms there and ready to use.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.640
There's been there's been an interesting shift happening.

18:13.640 --> 18:17.720
And I wonder where the market is going to be once unity eight arrives for end users

18:17.720 --> 18:23.920
because in the background, there is there's a big shift happening with the popularity

18:23.920 --> 18:25.400
of Ubuntu Mate.

18:25.400 --> 18:33.200
There is a lot of energy around projects like solace right now and elementary OS.

18:33.200 --> 18:38.840
There is a lot of energy and discussion there where there is some especially in the case

18:38.840 --> 18:43.880
of elementary OS and in the case of Mate there is some there is definitely some direct connections

18:43.880 --> 18:45.440
to Ubuntu.

18:45.440 --> 18:49.480
So they're not totally their own things, but they're kind of gaining speed and popularity

18:49.480 --> 18:56.600
and size as the more more and more the desktops people are interested in what the things people

18:56.600 --> 18:58.800
are talking about things with high momentum.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.880
So where's that going to be once unity eight actually arrives?

19:01.880 --> 19:02.920
Is it going to be too late?

19:02.920 --> 19:07.040
Are people going to have moved on or will it will we all be ready for something fresh

19:07.040 --> 19:08.040
again?

19:08.040 --> 19:09.040
I don't know.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.680
I think it's interesting, too, because last year we were talking about this.

19:11.680 --> 19:12.680
Sorry.

19:12.680 --> 19:13.680
Go on.

19:13.680 --> 19:17.600
I think the community talks about not liking unity, but I think a lot more people actually

19:17.600 --> 19:22.000
use unity than don't overall in the grand scheme of how many people use Ubuntu and don't

19:22.000 --> 19:25.160
care enough to change their D or even if they could.

19:25.160 --> 19:30.960
I think I would argue that I would I would argue that unity has the best multi monitor

19:30.960 --> 19:33.320
sport of any desktop operating system out there.

19:33.320 --> 19:36.760
And this is coming from somebody who just dumped unity for no.

19:36.760 --> 19:37.760
Yeah, there's that.

19:37.760 --> 19:43.920
I would say the only people who don't like unity are fussy Linux users because every

19:43.920 --> 19:47.080
regular person I've ever given it to, they have two impressions.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.080
Yeah, this is great.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.080
It works fine.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.080
Why are you asking?

19:50.080 --> 19:51.080
It's fine.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.080
Right.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.080
They don't have the concept of that.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.080
They really have a choice.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.080
Right.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.080
No, I've had that exact same experience.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.080
Yeah, I just know.

19:57.080 --> 20:01.260
And I just put a Linux box in for Hadia at her clinic and she has an employee that sits

20:01.260 --> 20:02.260
down there.

20:02.260 --> 20:07.720
She sits down there, uses it, literally did not even did not even say anything to her.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.320
She just sits down and uses it.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.240
She sees the icons on the side.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.240
She could do the printing.

20:12.240 --> 20:13.240
She can do the scanning.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.240
She does it.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.240
It's fine.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.240
All the buttons are in the right place.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.240
We've literally never had a conversation.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.560
And then when I finally asked her, how's the computer working?

20:18.560 --> 20:19.560
She's good.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.640
She looks at me like I'm crazy.

20:20.640 --> 20:21.640
It's fine.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.640
Should I do something wrong with it?

20:22.640 --> 20:23.640
Why are you asking?

20:23.640 --> 20:24.640
Yeah.

20:24.640 --> 20:25.640
You know what did not come out of her mouth?

20:25.640 --> 20:27.120
Well, I really can't stand unity.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.320
I really I wish it was known three Katie.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.520
Yeah, that was not what came out of her mouth.

20:31.520 --> 20:36.600
So we definitely live in a bubble when when it comes to these things just a little bit.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.440
The original argument about the guy saying that it's there, it's an exit from it.

20:40.440 --> 20:44.880
You could just say that it's a they're developing a convergence concept because they already

20:44.880 --> 20:50.180
had a desktop environment built and they already had the server infrastructure built.

20:50.180 --> 20:53.120
So in order to do the convergence, they needed to work on the mobile.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.000
So now that they're getting closer and closer to the convergence, they can work less on

20:56.000 --> 20:58.180
mobile and more on the other stuff.

20:58.180 --> 21:02.080
So just make just changing slight direction doesn't mean that they're going to completely

21:02.080 --> 21:03.080
abandon it.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.080
Yeah, I think so.

21:04.080 --> 21:10.760
Interesting, I think we would have talked last year about, you know, how we saw them

21:10.760 --> 21:14.720
focusing on mobile and how we liked what they were doing on the desktop, but they wanted

21:14.720 --> 21:16.000
to see more focus in that area.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.520
So it's almost kind of like an old Intel tick tock kind of thing where, hey, now we're back

21:19.520 --> 21:20.580
on the desktop.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.880
Maybe that means, you know, if it's a bad thing for 2016, maybe it means there'll be

21:23.880 --> 21:27.880
some good things in 2017 to be excited about, you know, and also, we've just watched so

21:27.880 --> 21:34.200
many different vendors or hardware makers or whoever just lose their ass in mobile.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.480
So it just doesn't look as awesome of a market as it used to.

21:36.480 --> 21:41.200
So as a company, they're probably going, well, maybe we'll just let them eat each other.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.760
We've got this cloud thing, desktop thing, enterprise thing.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.440
So what do you think of Jack's next point then?

21:47.440 --> 21:48.440
You ready for this one?

21:48.440 --> 21:49.440
Let's hear it.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.920
Yeah, so I think because, you know, we kind of were hard on that one.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.320
So this one might be a little different.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.120
Elementary OS will gain significant ground.

21:56.120 --> 21:59.400
He says, I'm not trying to be partial here, but I believe partially due to Canonical's

21:59.400 --> 22:03.560
failed foray into the phone space, Elementary OS will become a much bigger player by the

22:03.560 --> 22:05.400
end of 2017.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.400
There's a good reason for that.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.880
Elementary OS has an amazing flavor of Linux.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.000
It's very user friendly.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.960
It's beautifully designed, and it makes working with Linux very easy.

22:14.960 --> 22:18.760
He goes on also to say that Elementary OS currently stands at number five on DistroWatch

22:18.760 --> 22:19.760
with the ranking.

22:19.760 --> 22:26.600
And he says by the end of the year, he believes it will just be a bit number two under Mint.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.600
It's interesting.

22:27.600 --> 22:31.560
I just read another article today too that thinks that part of the reason they... People

22:31.560 --> 22:33.740
were speculating about... Where did I see this?

22:33.740 --> 22:38.040
People were speculating about what will take Linux to get to 5% desktop market share, and

22:38.040 --> 22:45.480
one of the things in that speculation was that Elementary OS would play a significant

22:45.480 --> 22:47.120
part in growth.

22:47.120 --> 22:51.960
This is two people now saying Elementary OS is going to play a significant role in 2017

22:51.960 --> 22:52.960
for growth.

22:52.960 --> 22:55.480
I don't think just Elementary OS either.

22:55.480 --> 23:02.280
I think Elementary OS are doing great things, and they are very squarely focused on the

23:02.280 --> 23:06.600
Windows and Mac users who are looking to switch to Linux.

23:06.600 --> 23:12.080
But I think the other two distributions that will also grow in popularity are going to

23:12.080 --> 23:18.800
be Solus and KDE Neon, but specifically its LTS version that they've just announced.

23:18.800 --> 23:19.800
Really?

23:19.800 --> 23:20.800
You think that?

23:20.800 --> 23:21.800
You think so?

23:21.800 --> 23:22.800
Tell me more why.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.960
Well, those three projects all have something in common.

23:25.960 --> 23:29.360
They've all... Well, Elementary has been around for a long time, but it's really come

23:29.360 --> 23:33.240
of age in this last release that they've put out.

23:33.240 --> 23:36.400
It really felt like it was the whole thing.

23:36.400 --> 23:44.600
But there's a lot of buzz around Solus and KDE Neon, and I think that people are tempted

23:44.600 --> 23:46.640
to those to try them.

23:46.640 --> 23:51.640
And I think what I've seen is a lot of Arch Linux users who are tired of curating their

23:51.640 --> 23:58.220
own system moving to more cutting edge curated desktop operating systems.

23:58.220 --> 24:04.600
So I think Elementary for those people that just want something that works and is stylish

24:04.600 --> 24:12.720
and has got familiar workflows, and Solus and KDE Neon for the enthusiasts, probably

24:12.720 --> 24:18.320
most of our audience, who are looking for something new and shiny that's got all the

24:18.320 --> 24:20.240
bells and whistles.

24:20.240 --> 24:25.880
That's interesting because Neon's been tugging at my distro hopping gene, or whatever it

24:25.880 --> 24:29.500
is in me that makes me want to constantly move around.

24:29.500 --> 24:33.360
It's tugging on that note again saying, hey, come over here to KDE Neon land.

24:33.360 --> 24:40.120
X-Metal in the chat room says, well, what's the difference between Neon LTS and Kibuntu?

24:40.120 --> 24:41.120
Where's the line there?

24:41.120 --> 24:42.120
What do you think, Ron?

24:42.120 --> 24:48.440
Oh, well, the biggest thing about the difference between Kibuntu and Neon is Kibuntu does the

24:48.440 --> 24:50.920
six month thing with Ubuntu.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.960
Neon is based only on the LTS 16.04.

24:54.960 --> 25:02.080
So that's the biggest difference, but also the Plasma desktop updates in Neon the day

25:02.080 --> 25:03.080
it releases.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.520
Kibuntu is months behind, usually.

25:06.520 --> 25:12.080
There was a post recently about how you can get the latest Plasma 5.8 in Ubuntu with

25:12.080 --> 25:13.760
the Kibuntu backports.

25:13.760 --> 25:18.840
If you had Neon, you'd already have it months ago.

25:18.840 --> 25:24.200
The difference between the LTS of Neon, it's kind of weird that they use that term because

25:24.200 --> 25:27.800
Neon LTS, they're both using Ubuntu LTS.

25:27.800 --> 25:34.120
It's just that the Neon version is like Plasma 5.8 is the LTS of Plasma.

25:34.120 --> 25:39.220
So Neon LTS is 5.8 Plasma on top of the LTS Ubuntu.

25:39.220 --> 25:43.240
So if you use the regular Neon and not the LTS Neon, you're going to continue to get

25:43.240 --> 25:44.360
updates to Plasma.

25:44.360 --> 25:45.360
So like 5.9.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.360
Right.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.360
Right.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.360
Right.

25:48.360 --> 25:51.280
But in theory, if you have an LTS desktop environment, an LTS based distro, that could

25:51.280 --> 25:55.420
be a pretty sweet setup for those that are looking for a powerful workstation that lasts

25:55.420 --> 25:56.420
a long time.

25:56.420 --> 25:58.240
And you wanted to add something to that discussion.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.240
Go ahead.

25:59.240 --> 26:02.720
I've heard that kicked around of which one, what's the difference between Kibuntu and

26:02.720 --> 26:03.720
Neon?

26:03.720 --> 26:11.200
Well, Kibuntu is Ubuntu's way of doing KDE and Neon is KDE's way of doing Ubuntu.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.200
And it's much better.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.280
No, because they're both separate.

26:15.280 --> 26:17.960
They're both different community projects.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.940
Canonical and Ubuntu does not work on Kibuntu.

26:20.940 --> 26:26.920
So that's I mean, that's like Kibuntu is more of a full service distro.

26:26.920 --> 26:30.760
It's got all the applications like ocular, PDF viewers and things like that.

26:30.760 --> 26:35.400
And it's all built in for you and it's got like email clients and all this other stuff.

26:35.400 --> 26:40.040
KDE Neon is just the fundamentals of what makes the distro work.

26:40.040 --> 26:41.040
And that's it.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.440
You add everything else yourself.

26:42.440 --> 26:46.080
So it's more of a minimalistic with a rolling on top.

26:46.080 --> 26:55.680
But there's the one thing I would say is that if you want if you want a KDE Ubuntu base

26:55.680 --> 26:59.800
and you don't want to do all the effort of having to like set up things up, Kibuntu is

26:59.800 --> 27:01.240
going to do it more for you.

27:01.240 --> 27:04.320
OK, so it depends on like your preference.

27:04.320 --> 27:08.360
I think what would be said about the enthusiast, Neon is definitely more for the enthusiasts

27:08.360 --> 27:11.740
rather than just give it to me and let it go.

27:11.740 --> 27:18.840
So Wimby, you say you notice a lot of buzz, I have to notice about about Neon, about Solus.

27:18.840 --> 27:22.680
But of course, you're being humble and not mentioning Matei, but I see a lot of buzz

27:22.680 --> 27:25.020
around that, too.

27:25.020 --> 27:26.020
That's interesting.

27:26.020 --> 27:31.280
So elementary OS, in my estimation, is probably going to be an important distribution.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.100
Is it going to be a game changer distribution, though?

27:34.100 --> 27:37.120
And something like what Wimby said, you know, they have been around a while and I feel like

27:37.120 --> 27:39.960
they, you know, it's not that they're not moving, they're doing a lot of cool stuff.

27:39.960 --> 27:44.400
It's just feels like it's a slower wave, a longer period, you know, that like it feels

27:44.400 --> 27:46.880
like it was a long time since I was excited about their last release.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.660
And now there's the newest release.

27:48.660 --> 27:49.800
And I think there's a lot of good things.

27:49.800 --> 27:54.160
But at least in our circles, maybe there's less because it changes slower.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.880
There's less that we have to think about.

27:56.880 --> 28:01.400
I think it's because they feel like they're it feels like they're playing catch up when

28:01.400 --> 28:05.760
other DEs already have like everything you expect.

28:05.760 --> 28:11.200
Like Pantheon for a for a long time, maybe even still, had had no ability to always on

28:11.200 --> 28:15.160
top for a window, which seems like a fundamental in every other DE.

28:15.160 --> 28:19.100
So like but when you when the reason why it's going to be very popular is because it's kind

28:19.100 --> 28:22.240
of like a full cohesive unit of a system.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.240
Right.

28:23.240 --> 28:24.240
Right.

28:24.240 --> 28:28.080
So I guess I wanted to double down on something that Wimpy said that Rotten seemed to jump

28:28.080 --> 28:33.400
in on and it kind of made my head nod, too, was that Wimpy said, I think one of the targets

28:33.400 --> 28:38.160
for Neon will be ARCH users who are sick of curating their own desktop.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.160
And that hit me because I see that sometimes.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.640
And Antigros definitely tries to serve that niche.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.940
But I wonder if that might be a thing over 2017.

28:46.940 --> 28:51.460
Will there be a as these other distributions stand up and get more popular and get more

28:51.460 --> 28:53.960
software available to them and get more momentum?

28:53.960 --> 28:56.080
Will there be a bit of a migration, do you think, Wes?

28:56.080 --> 29:00.200
And like as as rolling becomes more than just the ARCH Gentoo crowd, right.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.280
So it's like suddenly you have options.

29:01.280 --> 29:05.260
If you before, it felt like it was more like, yes, you rolled and you put everything together

29:05.260 --> 29:07.080
yourself and you got this great system.

29:07.080 --> 29:11.000
But it could be there's an audience there that they want the new packages, they want

29:11.000 --> 29:15.080
the fresh stuff, but they don't necessarily need to put it all together if someone else

29:15.080 --> 29:16.080
is glued it in a good way.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.040
You know, so let's talk about that for a second.

29:18.040 --> 29:24.920
So rolling has has changed or not changed, but has seen it sort of become like the buzzword

29:24.920 --> 29:28.080
in some cases for distributions like, yeah, we're going to go rolling, we're going to

29:28.080 --> 29:29.080
go rolling.

29:29.080 --> 29:33.520
We've seen some major refactorings, like on the case of OpenSUSE, you know, not this year,

29:33.520 --> 29:34.860
but just recently.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.280
And Fedora is now talking about that.

29:37.280 --> 29:41.260
It definitely seems to have done something really good for SUSE because it feels like

29:41.260 --> 29:45.040
in our audience, there's more people using it now than there used to be.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.520
It still doesn't feel like one of the major big players that has a lot of the community

29:48.520 --> 29:51.200
excited about it and hasn't taken over the enterprise.

29:51.200 --> 29:55.520
But it feels like it's carving out this this group of users that use it that really like

29:55.520 --> 29:56.520
it.

29:56.520 --> 29:58.560
And that's a good sign that they got they're doing something right there and that they

29:58.560 --> 30:01.000
could be on the precipice of tipping that over.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.560
So that's been interesting to watch SUSE.

30:03.560 --> 30:11.560
I wonder if I wonder if as we go through 2017, if we'll see that them across the door rumors.

30:11.560 --> 30:19.160
And then, my friends, we have Microsoft, oh, oh, Microsoft, oh, Microsoft, you just you

30:19.160 --> 30:21.520
never know what they're going to do anymore.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.800
And Jack thinks they're going to open up Windows.

30:23.800 --> 30:26.840
I wonder if he I wonder if he's bold enough.

30:26.840 --> 30:30.920
Oh, man, I know I wonder if he's bold enough to predict the license.

30:30.920 --> 30:33.840
This might sound crazy, he says, but for this Jack, man, I like you.

30:33.840 --> 30:36.120
But this is almost making me want to throw out this whole list.

30:36.120 --> 30:39.480
He says this might sound crazy, but I think it makes sense.

30:39.480 --> 30:42.560
Microsoft stands to gain far more leverage by opening up the source for their Windows

30:42.560 --> 30:43.560
platform.

30:43.560 --> 30:47.280
Not only would this be a boon for the enterprise, it would also enable a lot of enterprise level

30:47.280 --> 30:49.760
systems and services to better integrate with Windows.

30:49.760 --> 30:53.760
Yeah, because that's well, he says I don't suspect suspect we'll actually see an open

30:53.760 --> 30:55.060
source version of Windows release.

30:55.060 --> 30:58.640
What I do believe is that Microsoft will finally become open to this idea and begin to see

30:58.640 --> 31:03.280
a certain validity to handling over source to their platform specific entities.

31:03.280 --> 31:08.080
I don't I don't follow that at all, even I don't even think they could because of IP

31:08.080 --> 31:09.080
reasons.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.080
Exactly.

31:10.080 --> 31:11.080
This doesn't seem possible.

31:11.080 --> 31:14.280
If you remember the whole open Solaris project and how long it took them to rewrite the parts

31:14.280 --> 31:17.480
they needed to that were, you know, written by some contractor that they couldn't give

31:17.480 --> 31:19.480
out because they didn't have permission.

31:19.480 --> 31:23.000
I can't imagine Microsoft is any different with Windows.

31:23.000 --> 31:27.220
Like I'm sure there's tons of the Windows core that they just didn't even write a permission

31:27.220 --> 31:28.220
to use.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.220
Yeah.

31:29.220 --> 31:37.240
I think that the recent Microsoft partnership with Qualcomm will have more to do with Microsoft's

31:37.240 --> 31:41.720
resurgence than opening up Windows.

31:41.720 --> 31:44.680
So you familiar with this new new arrangement?

31:44.680 --> 31:45.680
No, talk about it.

31:45.680 --> 31:46.680
Please tell us.

31:46.680 --> 31:52.960
So Microsoft and Qualcomm are partnering so that Qualcomm are going to provide chips for

31:52.960 --> 31:58.800
Windows to run on ARM, but it's full blooded Windows desktop on ARM.

31:58.800 --> 32:02.800
And also the ability to run Windows 32 bit Intel binaries.

32:02.800 --> 32:05.280
I was going to say I have seen that platform.

32:05.280 --> 32:09.760
So they're going to do x86 32 bit binary emulation on ARM chips.

32:09.760 --> 32:18.240
Yeah, so that opens up the entire back catalogue of Windows software on this platform on mobile,

32:18.240 --> 32:25.840
which could or could not be either phones, but more likely probably surface type devices.

32:25.840 --> 32:29.040
There's no reason they're going to open up Windows to do that.

32:29.040 --> 32:33.360
No, I can see them doing more open things in their cloud environments and that focus,

32:33.360 --> 32:34.360
you know, new products being open.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.880
But yeah, there's just no reason to go back and do that.

32:36.880 --> 32:41.240
Historically, we can now look back over sort of, you know, 18 months, two years of Microsoft's

32:41.240 --> 32:47.560
behaviour and it's about server and enabling technologies that they've open sourced.

32:47.560 --> 32:51.120
It hasn't been core core products and it certainly hasn't been Windows.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.120
Right.

32:52.120 --> 32:58.800
So this is this has been my thought is if we watch Microsoft specifically now in 2017,

32:58.800 --> 33:03.320
I don't I think them doing much more with Windows.

33:03.320 --> 33:06.760
They're just going to do I think do business as usual with Windows as businesses need Windows

33:06.760 --> 33:08.760
and people they're doing business want Windows.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.640
It's just going to be what they've always done.

33:10.640 --> 33:16.040
I think what we need to watch for is the new Microsoft hardware that comes out in 2017.

33:16.040 --> 33:19.960
Their surface books, their home devices, the stuff that they're really kind of putting

33:19.960 --> 33:23.720
a lot of their intention and energy behind.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.000
How does that interact with Linux?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.480
How locked down is that?

33:26.480 --> 33:28.120
What is this built out of?

33:28.120 --> 33:31.480
What what can I do with this if I don't want to run Windows?

33:31.480 --> 33:33.560
Like what what are the answers to those questions?

33:33.560 --> 33:38.040
And depending on how close it is to well, pretty much whatever you want or anything

33:38.040 --> 33:42.840
that can use the API or well, if you just grab this, if the answer is getting closer

33:42.840 --> 33:45.240
to that, then that shows you what Microsoft's real intent.

33:45.240 --> 33:50.160
If the answer is, well, you need Windows 10 and it has to be activated, then that shows

33:50.160 --> 33:52.480
you where their where their intentions at.

33:52.480 --> 33:56.460
I would predict it's going to be the more open Microsoft.

33:56.460 --> 33:57.460
It's going to be the more.

33:57.460 --> 33:59.840
Oh, they don't really care what the OS is Microsoft.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.720
And I feel like that's the direction they're going in.

34:01.720 --> 34:06.520
And I would just expect more of that for to go as far as open sourcing Windows.

34:06.520 --> 34:07.520
Right.

34:07.520 --> 34:11.280
I think they're playing they're playing making a strong play towards developers, trying to

34:11.280 --> 34:13.840
be friendly towards developers and not put up roadblocks.

34:13.840 --> 34:17.520
And I don't think the Windows angle helps them with that in the same way as the open

34:17.520 --> 34:20.000
cloud API stuff does.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Yeah.

34:21.000 --> 34:26.560
So we've just finished recording the last two episodes of Ubuntu podcast for the year

34:26.560 --> 34:27.560
and also for season nine.

34:27.560 --> 34:28.840
So we now take a break.

34:28.840 --> 34:33.440
So if you're an Ubuntu podcast listener, we're we're off air for two or three months.

34:33.440 --> 34:34.680
That sounds so nice.

34:34.680 --> 34:41.720
And you want to you want to have a listen to what will be episode 44, which is our predictions

34:41.720 --> 34:46.200
episode and what Poppy has to say about Microsoft in 2017.

34:46.200 --> 34:47.800
So there's a tease for you.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.400
I will definitely check that out.

34:50.400 --> 34:55.480
I wonder if you have any thoughts on Chrome OS and Android merging in 2017 and if this

34:55.480 --> 34:57.520
is going to be a problem for Linux desktop.

34:57.520 --> 35:00.160
I don't I hate to be like chicken little.

35:00.160 --> 35:05.260
But when I think about actual competition to Linux, I don't think about Mac OS or Windows.

35:05.260 --> 35:08.200
Not long, long term, not really long term.

35:08.200 --> 35:12.560
When I think of general desktop computing and business computing, people that are task

35:12.560 --> 35:18.120
oriented that are that need this type of interface for the type of work they do, software development,

35:18.120 --> 35:23.640
production, the all there's so many categories of work that will never really work on touch.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.120
Maybe a lot of them always require local applications.

35:26.120 --> 35:30.760
And I just I just really believe that one day these types of computers, these roles

35:30.760 --> 35:37.420
will go towards a more general computing platform like Linux is always what I've hoped.

35:37.420 --> 35:41.000
But I feel like it's very probably going to be Android.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.640
Very likely because the industry is capable of wrapping its head around Android as a thing

35:45.640 --> 35:47.180
that it can build towards.

35:47.180 --> 35:49.840
They understand how to do product testing against it.

35:49.840 --> 35:54.420
They understand how to image and flash gets put in every little place you can imagine.

35:54.420 --> 35:58.540
And if they play ball, they get to take advantage of Google's APIs and services.

35:58.540 --> 36:01.920
And that makes it nice for end users because they don't have to worry about shipping software

36:01.920 --> 36:06.080
that actually is any good because they can just include Google stuff.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.040
So and they can integrate with their Android of things.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.040
Right.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.040
Of course.

36:10.040 --> 36:11.520
I really kind of wonder if they're targeting.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.840
Are they really targeting the same audience, though?

36:13.840 --> 36:17.480
I mean, Android is targeting your everyday, you know, person.

36:17.480 --> 36:21.960
I don't see many guys that are their heart, their developers, their their, you know, web

36:21.960 --> 36:22.960
designers, whatever.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.480
I don't see those guys going over to Android.

36:24.480 --> 36:28.880
And I think that's I think that's a large target audience that Linux could hit pretty

36:28.880 --> 36:29.880
heavily.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.660
If you can get the dev community, you can get the.

36:32.660 --> 36:34.160
Those guys aren't using Chrome OS either.

36:34.160 --> 36:35.160
Yeah.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.160
I know.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.160
That's what I'm saying.

36:37.160 --> 36:38.160
No, I agree.

36:38.160 --> 36:40.920
To be fair, I actually do it work and I use Chrome OS really regularly, but I'm mostly

36:40.920 --> 36:43.120
just SSH ing into a real machine.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.120
So right.

36:44.120 --> 36:48.120
I was just going to say and you also have your company has built you tools that specifically

36:48.120 --> 36:52.860
allow you to use Chrome OS, you know, as as as a method of production.

36:52.860 --> 36:55.360
Most people would not have those resources available.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.360
That's correct.

36:56.360 --> 36:57.480
That could just become a thing, though.

36:57.480 --> 36:58.480
But that could absolutely become a thing.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.480
Yeah, right.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.880
Like Chrome OS is actually really usable because I'm mostly as a staging through it.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.640
And I have a couple of web portals I use in the mail client, the browser and all that

37:04.640 --> 37:05.640
stuff.

37:05.640 --> 37:09.640
Yeah, I can see that unreasonable for a modern company, especially if you use exchange.

37:09.640 --> 37:13.120
You get Office 365 potentially, and that satisfies all your browser needs.

37:13.120 --> 37:16.200
Or you use the Google apps for business or use Google apps for business.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.080
Those two things are so popular now.

37:18.080 --> 37:22.320
Yeah, it seems fairly possible that if your other work can be ported somehow, whatever

37:22.320 --> 37:27.400
it is, you basically just describe the entire computing setup for my kids school.

37:27.400 --> 37:28.400
That's how they do it.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.400
Oh, no, that's not surprising at all.

37:29.400 --> 37:32.200
That would actually be the most poignant case to make is for school.

37:32.200 --> 37:34.360
It's really easy to go with a Chromebook these days.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.400
And that's what schools are going for because they're cheap.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.360
That's what they have done.

37:38.360 --> 37:41.040
Every kid in Dylan's second grade class gets a Chromebook.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.040
Oh, hey.

37:42.040 --> 37:43.040
The teachers are on Chromebooks.

37:43.040 --> 37:45.320
They're on Google apps for business.

37:45.320 --> 37:47.980
It's the whole shebang.

37:47.980 --> 37:49.440
And it's not just his class.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.640
That's how it is for the students there.

37:51.640 --> 37:52.640
And I don't know.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.520
I don't know who's getting that big fat check.

37:54.520 --> 37:55.520
Somebody got a big fat check.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.520
Yeah, definitely.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.520
Wow.

37:57.520 --> 38:01.960
So I could just I just to me this seems like this is going to spread.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.880
They can jump in real quick.

38:03.880 --> 38:04.880
It's free.

38:04.880 --> 38:09.740
I was actually just working with a client and Google actually you can work on a deal

38:09.740 --> 38:10.740
with Google.

38:10.740 --> 38:15.080
They will give you access to the console and Google apps for G Suite.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.260
G Suite is what they're calling it.

38:16.260 --> 38:19.080
But they give it to you for free if you're a school or education institute.

38:19.080 --> 38:27.320
Yeah, you need to be very careful about your definition of free here, because free is basically

38:27.320 --> 38:32.240
hooking a generation of children into the Google ecosystem.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.240
That becomes the new normal.

38:34.240 --> 38:37.080
That becomes what you expect to do.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.320
You thought it was bad when they were given a Macs.

38:39.320 --> 38:40.560
I mean, yeah.

38:40.560 --> 38:44.420
Or Windows computers and you're bringing them up on a closed source operating system.

38:44.420 --> 38:49.160
Now you're bringing them up into, you know, a whole online life.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.240
A privatized spine apparatus.

38:51.240 --> 38:54.280
Yeah, it's just it's just worrying.

38:54.280 --> 39:02.880
But that aside, you know, Chrome Android blended together for, you know, casual desktop use

39:02.880 --> 39:10.500
or maybe most, you know, office based jobs is very compelling.

39:10.500 --> 39:15.720
But like you say, for developer stuff, maybe not so much.

39:15.720 --> 39:22.120
And also Android have just announced their IoT thing, which is kind of just Android at

39:22.120 --> 39:23.120
the moment.

39:23.120 --> 39:28.480
They haven't seemed to announce anything specifically to target it at IoT.

39:28.480 --> 39:34.040
But because of the juggernaut of Android, you can see that that's going to sort of probably

39:34.040 --> 39:41.240
pick up some traction over the over the coming year.

39:41.240 --> 39:48.360
And it'll be interesting to see how people decide to build their IoT devices and platforms

39:48.360 --> 39:54.800
in the backdrop of 2016, which frankly has been a miserable year for IoT in terms of

39:54.800 --> 40:00.560
appalling security and carefree attitude by device manufacturers.

40:00.560 --> 40:08.400
I just want to quickly address kind of what, you know, I agree that there is definitely

40:08.400 --> 40:13.000
some concern and I definitely think that there is that we are paying a price, you know, for

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
the Google infrastructure.

40:14.000 --> 40:18.240
But I got to tell you, Wimpy, I mean, I sat on the other end of a conference call with

40:18.240 --> 40:22.680
three adults that had no idea what they were going to do for this infrastructure problem

40:22.680 --> 40:25.400
because they didn't have the budget, they didn't have the resources, they didn't have

40:25.400 --> 40:26.400
the money.

40:26.400 --> 40:30.680
And when we got a hold of Google and they said, hey, we'll just give you everything

40:30.680 --> 40:31.680
for free.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.800
We'll give you the we'll give you the way to manage the devices and we'll give you email

40:33.800 --> 40:35.400
and we'll give you the software.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.080
Everything when you get all of that.

40:37.080 --> 40:41.320
And then on top of that, on top of that, you have to understand when these kids leave the

40:41.320 --> 40:45.160
education institute, they are not tied to it.

40:45.160 --> 40:48.640
It's not like all of a sudden, like with what Microsoft is doing with their office suite,

40:48.640 --> 40:51.240
after you left the student and teacher version for one hundred and forty dollars, you wanted

40:51.240 --> 40:54.920
to write a resume, then they ding those students because they didn't have the professional

40:54.920 --> 40:56.240
version for five hundred dollars.

40:56.240 --> 40:57.360
It's not it's not like that.

40:57.360 --> 41:01.280
I mean, those students can go create a regular Google account and have access to all of those

41:01.280 --> 41:02.280
same tools.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.280
So, yeah.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.280
Is it in Google's best interest?

41:04.280 --> 41:05.280
Of course.

41:05.280 --> 41:08.680
Is Google taking that information and making money off of it while they say they're not?

41:08.680 --> 41:10.240
But they probably are.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.520
And there is so there is a cost there that's being paid.

41:12.520 --> 41:17.000
But I would think that I would say the real cost is that there's a huge benefit.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
I agree.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.200
There's a huge benefit to put computing in the hands of young children and enable students

41:22.200 --> 41:25.340
to have access to technology that didn't have it before.

41:25.340 --> 41:28.560
And I don't think that it is too expensive of a cost.

41:28.560 --> 41:32.680
I think that is probably the better good overall, especially if a certain percentage of them

41:32.680 --> 41:34.760
become intellectually curious about how it works.

41:34.760 --> 41:40.960
But the thing that does make me concerned is it's essentially the death of desktop software.

41:40.960 --> 41:45.920
What student is going to come up on Google Docs on Google Docs and ever, ever once they

41:45.920 --> 41:51.240
go start a business or they go into school, install LibreOffice and use that?

41:51.240 --> 41:53.200
That is never going to happen.

41:53.200 --> 41:58.360
It is it is guaranteed lock into the Google ecosystem because it'll simply be how they

41:58.360 --> 42:03.360
expect things to work, how they share information using their social network attached to Google.

42:03.360 --> 42:07.520
The way Google Docs works with links and all that you just you will become to depend on

42:07.520 --> 42:12.080
that infrastructure and those expectations and LibreOffice will never have a shot.

42:12.080 --> 42:18.980
In much the same way that Microsoft encouraged students to use Windows products from an early

42:18.980 --> 42:23.720
age throughout their education, all around the world.

42:23.720 --> 42:27.360
And people consequently know that as the de facto standard.

42:27.360 --> 42:32.760
And if you're not studying computer science or software engineering, it's unlikely that

42:32.760 --> 42:38.260
you will ever consider that there is anything else out there available, although most mostly

42:38.260 --> 42:41.920
because of iPhone and iPod, they're aware that Mac exists.

42:41.920 --> 42:42.920
So what do you think?

42:42.920 --> 42:49.960
Be careful what you wish for to two lines from a popular children's novel, eat me, drink

42:49.960 --> 42:52.880
me.

42:52.880 --> 42:56.120
I still think that Windows is so ingrained in the business world before kids get out

42:56.120 --> 42:58.320
of school using it.

42:58.320 --> 43:01.200
Maybe there may be more similar cycle.

43:01.200 --> 43:04.880
It was only what, like 15, 20 years of a life cycle of that stuff.

43:04.880 --> 43:05.880
I don't know.

43:05.880 --> 43:06.880
Microsoft, I don't know.

43:06.880 --> 43:09.120
You know, because it's getting chewed away at both ends because Microsoft themselves

43:09.120 --> 43:11.600
isn't exactly pushing Windows platforms too hard.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.580
They're moving people over to Azure and Office 365 on their end.

43:14.580 --> 43:18.440
So it's kind of getting chewed out from both ends.

43:18.440 --> 43:21.480
I just don't think any of these things last long enough that it's really ever a lock-in

43:21.480 --> 43:24.560
because they end up kind of fading and dying and things change.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.280
And that is good for us running Linux, right?

43:26.280 --> 43:27.280
Yeah.

43:27.280 --> 43:28.280
I mean, on the flip side.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.000
Not the native apps, but at least the base OS.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.320
The platform agnostic aspect that comes as a result of it is good for Linux.

43:35.320 --> 43:38.520
But that might not make Stolman very happy.

43:38.520 --> 43:39.520
Not much does.

43:39.520 --> 43:42.440
And the value of this is negative.

43:42.440 --> 43:45.460
So we're going to switch over to Ask Noah in a bit.

43:45.460 --> 43:48.480
So I probably, before we wrap up, should give you guys a heads up.

43:48.480 --> 43:50.880
I'll plug the phone number right now if you want to call in.

43:50.880 --> 43:55.080
And if you want to talk business, you want to talk Linux with Mr. Noah.

43:55.080 --> 43:58.640
One eight eight three four seven zero zero one one.

43:58.640 --> 44:00.800
One eight eight three four seven zero zero one one.

44:00.800 --> 44:05.520
If you're watching live right now, the last unplugged of the year, at least the last live

44:05.520 --> 44:07.240
one.

44:07.240 --> 44:10.560
And then next Tuesday is the Beard Spectacular Clip Show.

44:10.560 --> 44:13.240
But if you want to call in right now, if you're watching live, if you got a question for Mr.

44:13.240 --> 44:14.240
Noah, do it.

44:14.240 --> 44:15.240
And you should.

44:15.240 --> 44:18.680
One eight eight three four seven zero zero one one.

44:18.680 --> 44:19.680
OK.

44:19.680 --> 44:20.680
So there's one more thing.

44:20.680 --> 44:22.340
And this was sort of the worst of 2016.

44:22.340 --> 44:27.800
So I'm going to get to my what I think was the worst thing in Linux for 2016.

44:27.800 --> 44:29.560
And it was the vulnerabilities.

44:29.560 --> 44:30.560
Because we were.

44:30.560 --> 44:31.560
Oh yeah.

44:31.560 --> 44:32.560
Sorry.

44:32.560 --> 44:33.560
Not only were we not hit with.

44:33.560 --> 44:34.560
I'm sorry.

44:34.560 --> 44:36.200
How should I say this?

44:36.200 --> 44:38.440
Not only did we have a fair amount of vulnerabilities, right?

44:38.440 --> 44:39.440
Fair statement.

44:39.440 --> 44:44.180
But they were like super embarrassing, had been around a really long time and really

44:44.180 --> 44:49.400
hollowed out the argument that thousands of eyes make all bugs shallow.

44:49.400 --> 44:52.880
It really like we took a blow to one of our biggest mantras this year.

44:52.880 --> 44:54.120
And we had dirty cow.

44:54.120 --> 44:58.560
We had we had shell shock and we had just I think all the botnets, right?

44:58.560 --> 44:59.560
They're all made of Linux.

44:59.560 --> 45:00.560
Yeah.

45:00.560 --> 45:04.560
I was just I was gonna say I think we also had what was the was that LibreVault or not

45:04.560 --> 45:05.560
LibreVault?

45:05.560 --> 45:06.560
I can't remember.

45:06.560 --> 45:07.560
So I was was that this year?

45:07.560 --> 45:09.840
I can't remember if the heart bleed if it was heart bleed this year.

45:09.840 --> 45:10.840
Yeah.

45:10.840 --> 45:11.840
I can't call.

45:11.840 --> 45:12.840
It was 2014, man.

45:12.840 --> 45:13.840
Okay.

45:13.840 --> 45:14.840
All right.

45:14.840 --> 45:15.840
It's almost been three years.

45:15.840 --> 45:16.840
It feels like it feels like we had that's that's the reason.

45:16.840 --> 45:17.840
Okay.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.800
This is why because it feels like we had three or four heart bleeds this year.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.760
Like one year we had heart bleed and that was like, God, that was a bad one.

45:22.760 --> 45:23.760
And we all remember it.

45:23.760 --> 45:26.480
But it feels like this year we had like three of them.

45:26.480 --> 45:29.480
And it feels like we're on that we're that bad part of the slope where like we're finding

45:29.480 --> 45:31.760
a lot of these things, but they're we're getting them fixed.

45:31.760 --> 45:34.880
And it's just it's we're so big now.

45:34.880 --> 45:36.480
I'll tell you what the worst thing is.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.480
I mean, it's good.

45:37.480 --> 45:38.680
And I'm very thankful for it.

45:38.680 --> 45:42.360
But the worst thing is, you know, why all of these vulnerabilities are being found because

45:42.360 --> 45:48.320
either somebody is exploiting them or because a huge company that makes a ton of money off

45:48.320 --> 45:54.360
commercial software or stealing people's information and making ad money is doing projects because

45:54.360 --> 45:56.600
they have so much extra cash sitting around.

45:56.600 --> 46:00.880
They have a project to better their own interest in this field and are researching these look

46:00.880 --> 46:06.560
at like Google's Project Zero, Cisco's others, others have things just like this that only

46:06.560 --> 46:12.680
they could sustain because they make so much money that they can fund these things.

46:12.680 --> 46:16.600
It's not the millions of free software developers all around the world.

46:16.600 --> 46:20.200
Now hopefully some of these companies have snatched up some of the best software developers

46:20.200 --> 46:22.280
and that's they just happen to be there.

46:22.280 --> 46:26.980
But that's the other thing I don't really I really kind of wish we hadn't hit that so

46:26.980 --> 46:32.040
hard this year and I really kind of wish that we that it would have been more from the community

46:32.040 --> 46:36.240
would have I would have loved to have been like independent hacker groups on the Internet

46:36.240 --> 46:41.140
that have self-organized as a community and are doing this and solving these problems

46:41.140 --> 46:45.480
and have a name for themselves and are not Project Zero from Google.

46:45.480 --> 46:48.880
It's like just a group of real people that are just out there.

46:48.880 --> 46:49.880
I don't know.

46:49.880 --> 46:52.960
The community making itself better rather than something that feels kind of like outsiders,

46:52.960 --> 46:55.360
even if those people do heavily use open source themselves.

46:55.360 --> 46:58.880
And I'm always very thankful that these companies have these projects and it's like, OK, great.

46:58.880 --> 46:59.880
We found another one.

46:59.880 --> 47:02.160
At the same time, I'm like, I wish we could have caught it ourselves.

47:02.160 --> 47:06.240
Boy, it sure is stressing the no press is bad press, right?

47:06.240 --> 47:09.600
Yeah, just kind of not what the open source developers necessarily want to do.

47:09.600 --> 47:10.600
Right.

47:10.600 --> 47:13.320
Like these people who exist to find these vulnerabilities who love doing this are going

47:13.320 --> 47:14.960
to try to get paid to do it.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.640
And so they're going to join, you know, Project Zero and whatnot.

47:17.640 --> 47:21.820
So if you try if you're going to try to call Talos or whoever they call it, if you're going

47:21.820 --> 47:27.160
to try to call Noah, it's one eight seven seven.

47:27.160 --> 47:28.160
Not eight eight.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.160
I don't know why he said eight eight.

47:29.160 --> 47:31.120
Noah, what the hell, man?

47:31.120 --> 47:32.120
What the hell?

47:32.120 --> 47:33.120
Are you in there?

47:33.120 --> 47:34.120
Are you still in there, Noah?

47:34.120 --> 47:35.360
This guy was about to ask about this.

47:35.360 --> 47:36.360
Look at this.

47:36.360 --> 47:37.360
What does it say?

47:37.360 --> 47:38.360
Can you read that on my screen?

47:38.360 --> 47:39.360
What's that first telegram say?

47:39.360 --> 47:40.360
What was that first?

47:40.360 --> 47:41.360
It says eight seven seven.

47:41.360 --> 47:42.360
Uh huh.

47:42.360 --> 47:43.360
Well, OK.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.360
Now, are you going to make me take a screenshot?

47:44.360 --> 47:45.360
Really?

47:45.360 --> 47:46.360
See, look.

47:46.360 --> 47:47.360
What does that first number say, Wes?

47:47.360 --> 47:48.440
What does it say?

47:48.440 --> 47:49.440
That's all eights.

47:49.440 --> 47:50.440
That's all eights, baby.

47:50.440 --> 47:51.440
That's all eights.

47:51.440 --> 47:52.440
That's all eights.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.440
That's all eights.

47:53.440 --> 47:54.440
And then he sends me a correction.

47:54.440 --> 47:55.440
Hey, jerk.

47:55.440 --> 47:56.440
Hey, jerk.

47:56.440 --> 48:00.160
It's eight seven seven three four seven zero zero one one.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.160
Eight seven seven.

48:01.160 --> 48:03.160
We need an API call to return this.

48:03.160 --> 48:05.800
Three four seven zero zero one one.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.240
That I just can't even with this guy.

48:07.240 --> 48:09.080
I can't even with this guy right now.

48:09.080 --> 48:10.080
We don't know.

48:10.080 --> 48:11.560
But we're going to find out today on Ask Noah.

48:11.560 --> 48:12.840
I said just take Skype calls.

48:12.840 --> 48:13.840
That's what I said.

48:13.840 --> 48:15.080
I just take Skype calls.

48:15.080 --> 48:16.400
That's that's all.

48:16.400 --> 48:20.560
The other thing that I think did kind of start to develop this year is Apple did kind of

48:20.560 --> 48:24.080
have a rough year for the desktops and laptops and enthusiasts, the same people we're just

48:24.080 --> 48:31.960
kind of talking about in some regard are actually there is an uptick.

48:31.960 --> 48:36.280
I think the switch is real based on the feedback we've been getting on Koda radio from Mike

48:36.280 --> 48:37.280
switch.

48:37.280 --> 48:40.400
I feel like people have been following along with him because they're doing it, too.

48:40.400 --> 48:41.400
And they're coming from Max.

48:41.400 --> 48:44.920
And I think that's that's that's been a bigger trend this year than we expected.

48:44.920 --> 48:45.920
Oh, definitely.

48:45.920 --> 48:50.840
I mean, I don't I don't think we expected Apple the alienation to be that real.

48:50.840 --> 48:51.840
Right.

48:51.840 --> 48:52.840
Like there's always going to be some people switching.

48:52.840 --> 48:55.120
There's like that small little right little flow of people.

48:55.120 --> 48:58.720
But I have a lot of people who just there was not the computer that they wanted.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.480
They were really, you know, obviously they had been waiting a long time to buy a new

49:01.480 --> 49:03.440
Apple computer.

49:03.440 --> 49:09.460
It was it was it was an event that I guess what I expected was I expected a slow burn

49:09.460 --> 49:13.580
of boredom and dissatisfaction with a platform that wasn't really serving their needs anymore

49:13.580 --> 49:14.580
or being innovated.

49:14.580 --> 49:18.480
And what Apple did was they dropped this huge doubt bomb.

49:18.480 --> 49:22.960
This this massive doubt bomb that said to the hardcore enthusiasts, I'm not sure there's

49:22.960 --> 49:25.320
actually going to be any better Max.

49:25.320 --> 49:27.140
In fact, this is a Mark Gurman.

49:27.140 --> 49:33.880
For those of you that don't follow Apple News, Mark Gurman is probably the guy that has the

49:33.880 --> 49:38.000
best Apple sources in the tech press.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.040
Mark Gurman is he's he helped start a nine to five Mac.

49:42.040 --> 49:47.120
And then because his sourcing became so good, he was able to build a name for himself.

49:47.120 --> 49:48.480
He's been hired by Bloomberg.

49:48.480 --> 49:52.560
And now he writes for Bloomberg, who is trying to focus even more on technology because it's

49:52.560 --> 49:54.480
a huge part of the stock market.

49:54.480 --> 49:55.860
And that's why Bloomberg cares.

49:55.860 --> 49:57.680
So now Mark Gurman writes for Bloomberg.

49:57.680 --> 50:03.440
And today he wrote to to diehard fans, Apple's Macintosh sometimes seems like an afterthought

50:03.440 --> 50:04.440
these days.

50:04.440 --> 50:09.560
Mac upgrades once frequent frequent ritual are few and far between the Mac Pro.

50:09.560 --> 50:15.940
The Apple's marquee computer hasn't been refreshed since 2013.

50:15.940 --> 50:16.940
That's embarrassing.

50:16.940 --> 50:18.400
Yeah, it is embarrassing.

50:18.400 --> 50:22.440
The affordable and flexible Mac Mini was last upgraded in 2014.

50:22.440 --> 50:26.200
And the new machine when the me and when a new machine does roll out, the results are

50:26.200 --> 50:31.200
sometimes underwhelming, if not infuriating to the devotees.

50:31.200 --> 50:35.680
So he says that he's been interviewing people familiar with Apple's inner workings, and

50:35.680 --> 50:40.640
reveals that the Mac is getting far and far less attention than it once did.

50:40.640 --> 50:46.680
Confirming all these diversities, Gurman sources that the Mac team has lost clout within the

50:46.680 --> 50:51.160
famed industrial design group led by Johnny Ive and the company software team.

50:51.160 --> 50:55.160
They also describe a lack of clear direction from senior management, departures of key

50:55.160 --> 50:59.360
people working on Mac Mac hardware and technical challenges that have delayed the rollout of

50:59.360 --> 51:03.360
new computers.

51:03.360 --> 51:08.180
So there is a real actual lack of focus on the Mac in Apple.

51:08.180 --> 51:09.180
It's true.

51:09.180 --> 51:13.520
The Mac is actually dying in Apple.

51:13.520 --> 51:18.160
Now Tim Cook, they leaked a for an internal forum posting saying they have some great

51:18.160 --> 51:20.520
desktops in the line.

51:20.520 --> 51:21.520
But who knows?

51:21.520 --> 51:23.960
To them, the Mac, the new MacBook Pro is a great machine.

51:23.960 --> 51:24.960
They say it all the time.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.040
It's a great new machine.

51:27.040 --> 51:28.280
So their definition is great.

51:28.280 --> 51:29.280
It varies.

51:29.280 --> 51:34.360
And the Mac generates about 10 percent of Apple sales, which is legitimately big.

51:34.360 --> 51:35.360
That's billions.

51:35.360 --> 51:36.940
So it's bigger than some companies make.

51:36.940 --> 51:40.000
But yeah, that is not good.

51:40.000 --> 51:45.520
That is not good for the for those that are out there hoping to make their living on a

51:45.520 --> 51:46.520
Mac.

51:46.520 --> 51:50.980
I wonder how much this window, the bash on Windows 10 will play into that.

51:50.980 --> 51:55.180
You know, the divergence that we see come into Linux users versus how many developers

51:55.180 --> 51:59.720
will be more happy to stick with Windows if they can get a real Unix shell going.

51:59.720 --> 52:00.720
Yeah.

52:00.720 --> 52:02.720
This is this could be good for Linux, too.

52:02.720 --> 52:03.720
Go ahead.

52:03.720 --> 52:04.720
It could be.

52:04.720 --> 52:07.180
I was saying that I think the Windows people, the people who would stay on Windows because

52:07.180 --> 52:11.600
of the access to Linux are the people who are are you OK with Windows in the first place?

52:11.600 --> 52:15.440
I don't think they're going to leave to go to Mac and instead of going to Mac because

52:15.440 --> 52:20.160
of the new releases of the out of touch bar, they could go to Linux instead.

52:20.160 --> 52:22.360
Here's here's actually what I'm thinking.

52:22.360 --> 52:29.320
I think a lot of high end technical users that switch to Mac did it as a refuge from

52:29.320 --> 52:30.440
Windows.

52:30.440 --> 52:34.480
I think a lot of them were pissed off at Windows at the time and they wanted something else.

52:34.480 --> 52:37.260
And the thing is, is Windows 10 is not good enough.

52:37.260 --> 52:42.540
It is especially if you want like if you have any standards, if you want to have high DPI,

52:42.540 --> 52:46.620
if you want to have consistent interface, if you want normal power management settings,

52:46.620 --> 52:51.900
if you have any like sort of like particular esoteric, you know, hipster standards that

52:51.900 --> 52:56.280
a lot of people like to make fun of as as quaint and not necessary, but things that

52:56.280 --> 52:58.400
people pay attention to stuff notice.

52:58.400 --> 53:02.960
If you are a person that is it pays attention to detail, Windows 10 is infuriating to use.

53:02.960 --> 53:07.760
I mean, it's just it is just an absolute train wreck of a mismatch of UI and a lack of high

53:07.760 --> 53:11.940
DPI support and old routing and typical Windows.

53:11.940 --> 53:16.440
It is everything Windows always has been with some nice stuff on top.

53:16.440 --> 53:20.440
So it's not going to attract Mac users.

53:20.440 --> 53:23.820
They're going to look at Linux.

53:23.820 --> 53:28.640
It's just it's I just I think maybe the reason I feel the most fired up about this because

53:28.640 --> 53:30.760
I've gotten the most emails about this.

53:30.760 --> 53:32.280
We've had people following this.

53:32.280 --> 53:37.220
There's podcasters I listen to that are making a transition right now because it was recommended

53:37.220 --> 53:39.320
to me by audience members like, hey, listen to this guy.

53:39.320 --> 53:40.520
He's doing the same thing.

53:40.520 --> 53:43.000
And it's this person has never heard of the Linux action show.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.080
He doesn't know who I am.

53:44.080 --> 53:48.120
And he is going through a process of switching from a Mac to Linux because he didn't want

53:48.120 --> 53:49.400
to go back to Windows.

53:49.400 --> 53:54.340
And it's it's I tell it is I get enough input now that I feel like this is a thing that

53:54.340 --> 53:57.960
is happening, not saying it's billions of people, but I'm saying it's a category of

53:57.960 --> 53:58.960
users now.

53:58.960 --> 54:00.720
And I love it.

54:00.720 --> 54:01.720
I love it.

54:01.720 --> 54:02.720
It's funny, too.

54:02.720 --> 54:06.540
You kind of see this like like they knew they always knew they could they could do Linux,

54:06.540 --> 54:07.540
you know, but they just didn't.

54:07.540 --> 54:10.000
It wasn't they knew it didn't have the polish they wanted or they didn't think it had the

54:10.000 --> 54:11.000
polish they wanted.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.200
And so now there's this like, well, I'm forced to look and oh, hey, it's really not as bad

54:14.200 --> 54:17.120
or it's better than I thought elementary exists.

54:17.120 --> 54:20.240
You know, you're starting to watch you starting to watch some of the cracks in Mac OS.

54:20.240 --> 54:22.440
You know, the new battery life on the MacBook Pro sucks.

54:22.440 --> 54:25.800
And of course, one of the ways Apple fixes it is they just remove the time estimate from

54:25.800 --> 54:27.880
the battery menu on Mac OS now.

54:27.880 --> 54:30.920
You're starting to see the cracks.

54:30.920 --> 54:34.360
And so it's like, well, yeah, OK, Linux has some problems, but so does Windows and so

54:34.360 --> 54:35.840
does Mac OS.

54:35.840 --> 54:39.360
So which which ones do I want to work with this time?

54:39.360 --> 54:41.360
And then you know, the grass is always greener.

54:41.360 --> 54:42.360
It's right.

54:42.360 --> 54:43.360
Oh, yeah.

54:43.360 --> 54:46.140
So, W.W., you were you were just saying that you knew somebody who made the switch because

54:46.140 --> 54:47.480
of Windows 10 to a Mac.

54:47.480 --> 54:48.480
What happened?

54:48.480 --> 54:56.920
Well, it's actually a family member of mine because all all PCs come with a 5400 RPM drive

54:56.920 --> 55:04.080
and that's what's causing part of it because Windows 10 is so heavy that you're sending

55:04.080 --> 55:11.640
people laptops with a 5400 RPM drive in like 2016 when you should be sending them out with

55:11.640 --> 55:18.120
SSDs and people are having such a poor experience, or at least the people I know, that they rather

55:18.120 --> 55:24.840
go to a Mac, pay the extra money, not have the hassle of the average user and having

55:24.840 --> 55:28.800
to put up with Windows stuff and just have a smooth experience.

55:28.800 --> 55:32.680
They're willing to pay for that smooth experience that they get with Mac.

55:32.680 --> 55:38.680
Now, mind you, they're not the most technical person, but they just want a good UI, stuff

55:38.680 --> 55:44.480
that works and, you know, maybe they'll spend more because of it.

55:44.480 --> 55:47.480
I like that theory.

55:47.480 --> 55:51.680
I think I'm going to just sort of sit back and just sort of keep watching Mike and watch

55:51.680 --> 55:52.680
others.

55:52.680 --> 55:53.680
Mike's also considering doing it now.

55:53.680 --> 55:54.680
He's been doing it on Linux.

55:54.680 --> 55:57.920
He's considering doing a stint on Windows and see if he can get Bash on Windows to work

55:57.920 --> 55:59.760
for him and do that just to give it a fair shake, too.

55:59.760 --> 56:01.640
Yeah, no, that would be actually quite interesting.

56:01.640 --> 56:06.920
You know, I'm not going to do it, but it feels like it's worth looking into.

56:06.920 --> 56:14.760
I did want to just sort of conjecture about one other category that I'm getting sort of

56:14.760 --> 56:18.280
my opinions beginning to change from this is a toy to maybe this is something that's

56:18.280 --> 56:24.520
worth taking seriously, and it's not Linux-related specifically, though I do hope open source

56:24.520 --> 56:28.440
and Linux and the entire ecosystem isn't locked out from this next category in 2017, and I

56:28.440 --> 56:32.400
think it's going to be a tight line.

56:32.400 --> 56:36.760
I really think Amazon's nailed something with the Alexa.

56:36.760 --> 56:40.680
I thought, so I do something with the news is I notice when a new product comes out,

56:40.680 --> 56:41.680
there's a hype cycle.

56:41.680 --> 56:42.680
Oh, yeah.

56:42.680 --> 56:43.880
You know, it starts before the product comes out.

56:43.880 --> 56:44.880
It starts.

56:44.880 --> 56:45.880
Then there's the announcement.

56:45.880 --> 56:46.880
Then there's hype till the release.

56:46.880 --> 56:47.880
Then there's release.

56:47.880 --> 56:52.640
Then there's selective review hype where certain people release the reviews.

56:52.640 --> 56:55.540
Then there's the limited release to the public where you start to actually get the people

56:55.540 --> 56:59.280
that are using it begin to review and comment on it, and then there's folks like me who

56:59.280 --> 57:03.360
like to use it for a while and then give you a review, so those start to pop up for a while,

57:03.360 --> 57:06.720
and then it just sort of drops down, and there's not a lot of people that usually keep talking

57:06.720 --> 57:09.160
about a product after that if it's not successful.

57:09.160 --> 57:12.320
We don't get exact numbers from Amazon, but we know they just kind of churn them out as

57:12.320 --> 57:13.320
they can.

57:13.320 --> 57:17.920
Well, one of the things that I find to be really fascinating when it comes to the Alexa

57:17.920 --> 57:22.720
is there is still a good flow of posts about people talking about things you can do with

57:22.720 --> 57:28.560
it, ways you can integrate it, what an interesting device it is, how reliable it is.

57:28.560 --> 57:32.560
Those things are still being written on a daily basis about the Alexa right now, and

57:32.560 --> 57:35.320
Google's obviously interested in this area.

57:35.320 --> 57:39.000
Microsoft's interested in this area, who knows about Apple, but they've got Siri on the devices.

57:39.000 --> 57:45.160
I wonder if in 2017 if we will be able to be somewhat of a player in this field.

57:45.160 --> 57:50.960
I'm not really even talking Mycroft, I mean just our stuff isn't off on its own island.

57:50.960 --> 57:53.040
We're not completely left out.

57:53.040 --> 57:56.320
We're not completely excluded from playing.

57:56.320 --> 57:58.520
I wonder where this is going to go, and what do you think, Wes?

57:58.520 --> 58:01.240
When I look at things like the Alexa, it seems to be more open.

58:01.240 --> 58:03.680
It seems to be the more successful device.

58:03.680 --> 58:06.400
So I guess I'd say, what do you mean by we, when you ask that question?

58:06.400 --> 58:10.760
Well, when I'm using things like... Well, I like to use Telegram instead of WhatsApp.

58:10.760 --> 58:16.080
I like to use this podcast player instead of... What's the one, the streaming one that

58:16.080 --> 58:18.440
combines all the shows and makes it sound worse?

58:18.440 --> 58:22.400
It's the really popular podcast player that I should know off the top of my head.

58:22.400 --> 58:23.760
I should too, but I don't know.

58:23.760 --> 58:24.840
It's a podcast... Oh, damn it.

58:24.840 --> 58:29.680
It's like it basically makes... Anyways, there is software, there are radio and streaming

58:29.680 --> 58:31.360
services that just work with Alexa.

58:31.360 --> 58:32.360
Work with Alexa, right.

58:32.360 --> 58:38.160
There's stuff that when you're in their ecosystems, you work, but... I guess what I'm talking

58:38.160 --> 58:39.280
about, the things I choose to use.

58:39.280 --> 58:42.520
I choose to use Telegram instead of WhatsApp, or I choose to use...

58:42.520 --> 58:45.320
If you've made niche decisions about the products, maybe they're more open source friendly.

58:45.320 --> 58:47.920
Maybe they're more... Whatever, but they're not the... Yeah.

58:47.920 --> 58:51.280
Or maybe I have my calendar on own cloud instead of Google Calendar, or Nextcloud.

58:51.280 --> 58:54.900
It really does come down to how well do these things play with different APIs.

58:54.900 --> 58:55.900
Is there interop?

58:55.900 --> 58:56.900
Is that the focus?

58:56.900 --> 58:59.880
Because if it is just the three big... And you see that with a lot of things where it's

58:59.880 --> 59:05.280
like, hey, we integrate with your favorite clouds, that means you have Dropbox and iCloud,

59:05.280 --> 59:06.280
and that's it.

59:06.280 --> 59:11.200
But if it's like, hey, you can add whatever here, add your custom drop in a URL for your

59:11.200 --> 59:13.840
calendar files, and here you go, that's a whole different story.

59:13.840 --> 59:17.280
Have you thought about picking up on Alexa?

59:17.280 --> 59:18.340
Or a Google Home?

59:18.340 --> 59:20.180
The Google Home looked a little more interesting.

59:20.180 --> 59:22.320
When Alexa first came out, it was interesting.

59:22.320 --> 59:25.800
I'm very interested in their... It seems like they've done a lot of good work with

59:25.800 --> 59:29.480
the microphones, with actually making it so that it can hear you and process your voice

59:29.480 --> 59:31.240
well, which is interesting.

59:31.240 --> 59:32.240
And I did notice-

59:32.240 --> 59:33.240
Slash creepy.

59:33.240 --> 59:34.240
Slash creepy.

59:34.240 --> 59:38.040
It did also seem that, at least with Alexa, they've kind of... And maybe because it was

59:38.040 --> 59:43.520
from Amazon, who... I think on Coder you were talking about, it's kind of like the

59:43.520 --> 59:44.520
big four.

59:44.520 --> 59:46.740
They kind of get grouped in differently now.

59:46.740 --> 59:47.740
So maybe it was a little more friendly.

59:47.740 --> 59:51.080
But it seemed a lot of people who do value open source or free software had been playing

59:51.080 --> 59:52.180
with the Alexa in a way.

59:52.180 --> 59:56.040
So it does seem like it has some developer mindshare in that respect that maybe other

59:56.040 --> 59:57.040
devices don't.

59:57.040 --> 59:59.640
That's a good way... I think that's what I was trying to say, is the developer mindshare

59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.640
aspect of it.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.640
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:03.880
I don't suppose... I'm going to roll the dice.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.040
I don't know why I'm betting no for some reason.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:09.000
It's not that I think that you guys are all a bunch of haters, but I just... I'm going

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.480
to guess... Does anybody in the Mamba Room have an Alexa or a Google Home?

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.480
Nope.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.480
No.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.480
Yeah.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.480
Anybody considering getting one?

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.480
No.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.480
Maybe.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.480
Oh, okay.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.080
So there is a wide range.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.040
So Wimpy, did you jump in on the IM?

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.040
Yeah.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.320
Oh, all right.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.160
Tell me about this.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.320
I'm tempted to get an Amazon Echo.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.320
So am I.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.720
Why are you?

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:44.600
Because friends of mine that have experimented with it and reading that I've done on the

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:51.820
API, I can see how I can integrate it into projects that I'm working on trivially, more

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:59.520
trivially than the other systems out there of a similar nature.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:05.000
I've been thinking about getting it because there are four... I'm sorry.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
No.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:13.600
There are one, two, three, four, five, six lights in the studio that are Hughes lights

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.680
that are used now in production.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.080
And also there's certain timer aspects that could be really handy and certain other functions

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.720
like J-Bot functions that could be really cool with Alexa.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.120
So I was thinking about maybe not necessarily for my house or my RV.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.120
But for the studio.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.120
For the studs.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120
Hey, that could be fun.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.120
Yeah.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.120
What about... Now, Rod and I hear you jump in.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.120
So you were thinking about it too?

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.120
Yeah.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.120
I'm thinking about it as well.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.780
Mainly because they have the multi-tier options.

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:42.080
So it's not just like one device that you purchase that's $100 or something.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.560
The default Echo is $150.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.560
Oh.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.760
So then if you found it useful, you could slip it in in other places for cheaper.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.760
Yeah.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.840
The Echo Dot, they also have the Echo, the Tap, and the Echo Dot.

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:59.160
The Echo is like $150, the Tap is like $90, and the Dot is only like $50 or $40 depending

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.560
on if it's a discount or not.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.560
Like right now it's only $40.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:02.560
Yeah.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.080
You could get them in a three pack on special offer right now.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.080
Oh.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.080
What?

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.080
The deal.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.080
What?

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.080
Oh no.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.880
Oh, you know, Chris hasn't gotten a Christmas present for himself.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:15.880
Oh.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.880
You deserve it.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.880
You've been a good boy.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.520
Now, does anybody know, will the devices work together?

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.520
Can I set a reminder, say, at home and then show up at the office and have the Echo at

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.960
the office help me?

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.960
Anybody know?

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.960
Yeah.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.160
See, I think it's time I do need to figure these things out.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.160
Yeah.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160
I hate not knowing.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.160
That would be a good point.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.160
Well, so anyways, I think that's going to be an interesting category.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.160
I know there is integration.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:44.400
I saw a video explaining that the integration exists, but I don't know in different locations

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.400
how well it works.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.400
Fascinating.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.440
So I think this is going to be, I think it's going to be a really interesting category.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:54.800
And the thing is, I don't think all of the big players that are going to get in have

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.040
gotten in yet.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.840
I think there's still going to be some interesting entries.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:00.720
So check it out.

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.720
Check it out.

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.680
It's, we'll have the links to the Echo in the show notes and the DOT if you guys are

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.680
curious.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.080
And if you have one, let me know, let me know how that works.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:12.160
There's another thing that you might want people who are like paranoid about and always

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.160
listening.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.400
The tap version doesn't listen to you until you hit the button.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.400
Right.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.400
The DOT is 90 bucks.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:22.120
The DOT is 40 bucks and the big Echo is 140 bucks.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.460
So the DOT and I don't think the DOT is not always listening either, right?

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:26.460
The DOT is.

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.460
Yeah.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:28.460
Oh, it is?

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.460
Yeah.

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.560
You're telling me the DOT does everything the big Echo does.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.200
It's just not a huge speaker.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.200
Yeah.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.480
It doesn't have as big speaker and it doesn't have as like the microphone.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:40.920
That seems obvious then that seems like that for 40 bucks, that's an obvious way to try

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.920
it out.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.920
Try it out.

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.920
Yeah.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.920
See that starts tempting me too.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.920
Like I don't need it in my life.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.920
I don't need those things.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.920
But for 40 bucks, I can-

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.920
It seems like a lot of fun to do it.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920
The category is interesting enough.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.320
No, it's better because it has the aux out and everything so you can hook it up to like

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:53.600
a decent speaker system.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.600
No.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:55.600
That's great.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:56.600
Yeah.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.600
That's the draw to the ones that don't have the speakers is they can be hooked up.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.600
That's pretty clever.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.600
Yeah.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.800
Actually, if you go look on Amazon, go look at the advertising material, it shows it hooked

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800
up to a receiver.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.800
Yeah.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:05.800
I see that.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.800
To like a Pioneer or something.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:08.800
Also it will-

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.800
That's what I've done.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:10.800
Yeah.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.400
It will also connect to the speakers using Bluetooth so I could just pair it to the Bose

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:14.400
Bluetooth speaker.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:15.400
Exactly.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.400
Yeah.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:24.560
So at the Makerspace, we paired an Echo Dot to a Bluetooth speaker to improve its speakers.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:33.560
And during Cyber Dark Black Tuesday, Friday, whatever it's called, they were doing three

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:39.240
Echo Dots for a combined discounted price of like $60 or something.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.240
Wow.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.240
This is a very...

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.240
That's a very compelling that they're having that-

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.240
Are they sending it to the Hue lights?

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.240
Oh, man.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.240
Yeah.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.240
They're sending it to the studio.

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.240
So that just seems like a-

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.240
I just want this in my room so I can be like, hey, turn on my lights when I wake up or hey,

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.120
turn them off at night without having to go hit the switch, which is really far away.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:58.020
That's what I'm interested in because I've identified as a lights project as something

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:05.180
that is going to have wife acceptance factor and also sort of in-law acceptance factor

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:08.360
because they've already got a sort of a lighting system.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:12.920
And I want to experiment with the Dot to do control of lighting.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.480
Yes, for sure.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:19.280
And I wonder, you know, if I got just a couple of smart plugs, I could make all of these

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.280
lights controllable.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:24.700
One thing I noticed in discussion of this is that it seems like busy people or people

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:29.000
with children are very interested in these products, just in the kind of direct accessibility,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.960
the kind of a lot of times in busy situations, you can use your voice when you can't use

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.320
your hands or sit down to do something more complicated.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.120
Like I'm coming in the door at home and my hands are full of my bag for the day and my

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.120
groceries.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.120
It'd be nice to just-

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.120
But you still need information or you want to turn-

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.120
Turn on the lights.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:50.840
For those of you, for those of you that want to do like IoT stuff, but without the development,

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:57.800
Alexa was recently added to IFTTT so you can do if this, then that rules and hook Alexa

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:05.120
up to all the other pipes that IFTTT supports.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:07.800
You know, the only thing I wish, does anybody know-

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.640
Which includes Hue lights and all the rest of it.

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:14.440
So the Echo runs on what, Fire OS?

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.440
What does it do?

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.680
Do we know what the underlying operating system is to the Echo?

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:19.280
Is it Linux?

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.280
You would have to think so.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.280
Probably broken.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.200
It's probably not BSD.

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.840
It's probably Linux.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:26.840
So it's-

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.840
Just based on their other-

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:28.840
Who knows?

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:29.840
It's safe to put in LadyJuice.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:30.840
It's safe.

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:31.840
Well, it's only Linux and LadyJuice.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.840
Right.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:33.840
So that's the thing.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:34.840
Well, okay.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.240
Maybe you have to take it down and see what you can find out.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.960
Well, now that we've all made Chris, boy, I can actually see a pretty cool episode out

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.960
of this too.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:41.960
I could-

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.960
Oh, yeah.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.960
And specifically talking about how to make it work with Linux.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:44.960
Oh my gosh.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.960
Now I'm going to sell it to myself.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.960
I got to stop.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.960
It's happening.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:48.960
It's happening, everyone.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:51.080
Well, I hope you enjoyed this half of the show.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:54.680
I don't know how much more show we have, but I want to now get us ready to transition over

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:57.200
to Grand Forks, North Dakota.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.280
I want to also let you know that coming up on the Linux Action Show, and probably this

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.360
show too, we'll be doing our 2017 predictions soon.

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:07.720
So I'd love to get the conversation rolling on that, linuxactionshow.reddit.com, if you

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:13.360
have thoughts about 2017, you can leave in the comments here, or start a thread, I don't

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.320
give an S, or just tweet them at me, at Chris L-A-S, and we'll start talking about that

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.360
very soon.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.400
So what we're going to do now is a little internet magic.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:26.520
We'll hit pause on our end, and when it comes back, you'll be hearing from Mr. Colonel Linux.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:32.160
Something a little different.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:35.720
Live from Grand Forks, North Dakota, the show that puts you, the listener, in the driver's

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.960
seat because you are the content.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.000
The phone lines are open to be a part of the program.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Give us a call.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:49.320
It's toll free, 1-877-347-0011, and we'll talk about your tech problems, or your business

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.800
and tech problems.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.420
Linux advocate, above all else, small business owner, and now host of the only show that

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:58.960
centered around you, the audience, welcome to Ask Noah.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.520
And as you might have guessed, I am Noah.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:11.000
Now this show, well this particular episode really, was born right at the end of LASS.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.280
Basically Chris said, I want to see, can we get a show up and running in 48 hours?

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.680
And so this is the test of that.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:23.120
The job looks much easier from the outside than it actually is.

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:26.840
To actually get all of the equipment set up, get everything tested, get levels right, get

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.640
the recording set up, get the graphics rolling, all of that, it takes time.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.960
And so I don't have all of the equipment I want.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:37.480
I don't have things set up the way I want it to.

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:42.700
But we're going to try this and see if we can take calls, if this works.

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:48.880
So you call in 1-877-347-0011 and we'll talk.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.880
Ask any question you want, ask it about Linux, ask it about technology in general, or ask

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.720
it about business.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:09:01.440
We're going to start going out to the phones and let's see here, who do we have?

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:08.940
We're going to start with Justin from Boston, Massachusetts.

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:14.000
So there's a little bit of a delay right now for the way that our call system is set up.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.480
Justin will be here with us in a second and I'll take his questions.

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:24.780
I made a post on Reddit a while back about business and how we set everything up and

01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:30.840
how we got things rolling here at AltaSpeed and that post got so many likes and so many

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:32.320
other follow-up questions.

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.060
People sent me emails.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:40.060
People went online and sent in contact forms and got a hold of me.

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:43.400
All sorts of different ways.

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.840
So if you have a business question, you can answer that as well.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.080
So Justin, you're with us and you're here from Boston, Massachusetts I believe.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.080
Hello.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.080
Welcome to Ask Noah.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.080
Hey Noah.

01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.080
How's it going?

01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:03.880
So it's a bit of a complicated setup but it comes down to this.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:11.900
I am looking at building a personal infrastructure for a replacement Google Drive.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:17.420
After some price hikes with Google Drive, some file manipulations on Amazon Drive and

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:22.400
other cloud services, I've gotten really, really tired of trying to put terabytes of

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.280
data somewhere that is not physically at my home.

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.280
Gotcha.

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.280
Okay.

01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:33.960
So I've got this idea of putting together a few boxes, putting NextCloud on these boxes

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.200
and sort of replacing Google Drive with that.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:44.800
However, I've heard you and Chris, among others, have some issues with large amounts of data

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.000
with own cloud and NextCloud being a successor.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.720
I have that same worry but I also wonder about multi-user support and if you guys have had

01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:01.960
experience with that because this is a solution for tens of people and the ability to scale

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.440
this up if need be.

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:08.960
Currently, the plan is two or three machines that are going to be targeted from the desktop

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:14.200
client and then these two or three machines would be essentially their own redundancy.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:18.040
If one goes down, the others pick up the slack and so forth.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.040
Gotcha.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.680
So I'll tell you what my experience has been.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:25.720
I was one of the early adopters of own cloud, Chris was as well, and we used own cloud extensively

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:31.600
and what we found was it worked fine for syncing documents, for syncing pictures.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:37.880
Large amount of files weren't a problem but when you took a 20 or 30 or 40 gigabyte file

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:43.000
and tried to sync that across multiple machines, what we found was you'd get files that were

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.740
corrupted and occasionally you'd have some files that were missed entirely altogether.

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:51.580
I have found that most of those problems have been resolved.

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:55.800
I was on the last version of own cloud before the split and I tried it with some test data

01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.640
and ran that for a while and that seemed to work pretty well.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.280
If you watched the last week's episode of the Linux Action Show, we actually talked

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:09.900
to Joss from the NextCloud project and they have continued to approve upon the technology

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:13.080
and feature set that own cloud left behind.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.940
I have some lingering concerns.

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:17.400
First of all, I have some concerns with the database that they're using.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:22.380
It is possible to swap it out, it's possible to point it to something other than SQLite.

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:26.320
The other thing I have a concern with is with the syncing application, it's using CSYNC

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:34.760
on the backend and the entire workhorse is essentially written in PHP and I'm not a coder

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:38.600
and I don't necessarily claim to understand some of the underpinnings of this but everyone

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:45.880
that is in the know tells me that the choices of technology that they have used are not

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.880
the best.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.480
I'm going between two different options right now.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:55.180
My first option is I'm looking at C file for doing file syncing but I'm actually also looking

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:59.960
at building a file server for our company to sync all of our files and we're still considering

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:00.960
NextCloud.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.360
Joss actually talks about how they actually have deployments of large users, universities

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.360
so to speak.

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.240
If you haven't seen it, I'd suggest you go check out that episode because it does a very

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:14.920
good job of explaining how NextCloud does scale.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.560
I would be willing to give it a shot I think if I were you as in fact I'm going to do the

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.560
same.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:30.960
With that in mind, with your experience, how reliable is it in its rescanning I guess?

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.800
One of my concerns is I've, albeit in a virtual machine network, I have set up a few instances

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:44.440
of on cloud and it's nice to start out by just throwing data into the data directory

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:50.680
itself and letting NextCloud rescan and everything appears really nicely in the web interface

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:56.640
but that isn't always super viable and I've noticed that with the desktop client certain

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.480
folder names will just be ignored.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:07.200
For example, I have a folder called archives and I have to explicitly rescan with that

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.000
folder being an exception list to get that folder to appear in the web archive or pulled

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
down by other users.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.120
Are these the kind of problems that you've had experience with?

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:18.220
Yep, I've experienced almost all of those.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:24.580
I have found that the way to make own cloud the happiest is to install the client, point

01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:28.660
it towards whatever directory you're going to use and then give it a couple of minutes

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:32.760
to kind of sync itself up and then start adding data to that directory.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:37.240
The worst possible thing you can do is climb in under the hood and start moving data around

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.240
on the server.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:43.200
I have destroyed my entire own cloud instance, well my user account anyway, all of my data.

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.960
I've erased all of my data by doing stuff like that.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:53.380
So I would encourage you to be pretty cautious in that regard but I think it's pretty much

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:54.580
ready for prime time.

01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:59.680
I think I would go ahead and give it a shot.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:05.160
And again, I'll be able to tell you more as time goes on because I'm going to be implementing

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.160
this myself.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.120
I'm going to try Nextcloud and see if it works.

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:12.400
I looked into the commercial alternatives like Dropbox and that's kind of the go-to

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.620
if you're in the business world is you sign up for Dropbox for business.

01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:20.680
But they're charging, I think it's something like $9 a user or something.

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:29.160
We have a small team and file syncing is not a central part of our business so the idea

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:35.860
that I would be able to afford that kind of capital stream for the return on the investment

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:36.860
just isn't there.

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:40.040
We're going to head back over to Washington State right where Chris came from.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.040
Sean's joining us.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.040
Hi Sean, how are you?

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.040
Hey Noah.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:44.040
Hey, thanks for joining us.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.040
How can we help today?

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:52.680
So me and a couple of my friends are looking at starting a podcast, just us sitting around

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:58.960
shooting the breeze about technology and we got some mics, we got some computers and not

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.320
really sure where to go there from next.

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.180
Are you guys doing audio only or are you doing audio and video?

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:07.180
Audio only.

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:08.240
Awesome.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.240
So never do video.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:14.480
If you go talk to anyone that's doing video in the podcast, they'll tell you that they

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:19.560
would give, they'd trade their soul to the devil to go back in time and never do video.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.280
Audio is actually pretty easy to do.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:29.000
I have tried, I've used Skype and Mumble side by side and there's a lot of people that will

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.280
tell you that Skype is a very high quality piece of software.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.360
I think Skype works okay.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:43.120
I found that conference calling in Skype can be difficult at best and also I believe it's

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:48.720
Silk, the Kodak or a modified version of Silk that is the Kodak that's being used in Skype.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:56.080
My understanding is that a future version of that or a built upon version of that is

01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:02.240
the Opus Kodak which is what can be used in Mumble and also there is a growing number

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:08.360
of people that are using G.722 or 729, one of the two.

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:14.960
I can double check and get back to you but the G.722 is basically what they've done is

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:20.840
they have built upon what was a phone standard and built it out and so if you look at, I

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:26.920
actually had the opportunity to try some inter-price grade audio connection tools that were basically

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.280
designed to facilitate remote studio connections and they were using the G.722 Kodak.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:38.340
That Kodak is available in software like Zoiper and so you can set up a conference call between

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:42.440
three or four participants or five participants and you could actually use the exact same

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:47.000
Kodak as the industry professionals were using.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.520
If you have mics and you have audio interfaces and you're just looking for the connection

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:51.520
piece, that's an option.

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:54.200
If you want something simpler, Mumble is a great way to go too.

01:17:54.200 --> 01:18:01.720
Yeah, because I'll be doing everything on Linux but the other two guys have, one uses

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.680
Linux and Windows and one uses just Windows, so.

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.680
Okay, great.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:13.520
Well, I really appreciate you taking the time to call in again, 1-877-347-0011.

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:18.900
That's the number and we'll take your calls, we'll answer your questions.

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:23.580
It is really fun to be able to actually do this.

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.960
Every day I'm solving problems on Linux.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.880
I'm going through and trying this stuff.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.560
This Kodak thing was one thing that I was looking at doing because obviously we're looking

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.920
at implementing something like this on JB and so as I have gone through and kind of experimented

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.800
with this, I can't really make an episode about it but Sean calls in from Washington

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:45.600
and says that he wants to facilitate remote connection between him and his friends to

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.600
do a podcast.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.100
Well, now we're talking, right?

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.400
Now that's something that we can do.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:57.280
James, North Carolina, you're calling in about System D. How can we help?

01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:05.200
Oh, yes, I was calling about some, I guess, more general recommendations with Ubuntu and

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:07.640
I primarily use Linux myself.

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:14.520
Switching over to System D from Upstart, a lot of programs that I had used for programming

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:20.800
things like automatic triggers for like green dimming when power disconnects from a laptop

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:26.960
or things like that no longer work with System D. So I was just curious if you guys have

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:32.480
any recommendations of like programs that you can interact with those System D triggers

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.640
to do things.

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.640
That's interesting.

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:43.920
So I have done a number of different upgrades in the last couple of years moving from – to

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.240
the latest version of RHEL which of course uses System D and it's interesting.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:53.240
I have worked with some pretty esoteric pieces of software and I've not run into that issue.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:20:00.080
Most of those calls are set up so that it just translates any of those Upstart commands

01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:07.440
right to System D. It seems like it's pretty smoother, RedSK, System D, but do you have

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.920
some custom stuff that is written in there, custom stuff that it's calling or custom

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.560
things that it's doing?

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.560
No.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.360
Oh, I just remembered the name of it.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.360
It's called Cuttlefish.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:24.320
It was a program that would essentially tie into some of the triggers for things like

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:32.480
when you log on, if you I guess disconnect from your session, if you put the laptop to

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:35.800
sleep, wake it up, that kind of deal.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:41.680
So you could basically connect that to any type of bash script and you could have it

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:47.320
run as triggered or you could have it do a few preset actions as well.

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:52.200
Yeah, so I guess I'll tell you what I'll do.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:57.080
If you head over to jupyterbroadcasting.com, click on the contact link, click on Ask Noah.

01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:01.480
I don't have any great recommendations for you but I know a guy that knows everything

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:10.120
there is to know about moving older init systems to System D and if you send me a contact form,

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:13.080
I'll put you in contact with him and I'll see if you guys can get together and see if

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:18.440
you guys can work something out because I'm sure there's somebody that has run through

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:19.440
this.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:21.000
For me, it has been a marvelous experience.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.400
Moving to System D has been flawless.

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:28.720
In fact, the only thing that I've really noticed is my boot times have gone from like a minute,

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.560
minute and a half down to mere seconds.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:35.360
That's the big difference for me from moving from the older init systems to System D. So

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:40.960
I really don't have any complaints and like I said, I worked with some pretty esoteric

01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:41.960
pieces of software.

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:48.000
I worked with the university on some chemical calculation software that I mean, it was just

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.720
a tiny little company and it's a very, very limited use case and all of that stuff worked

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.960
perfectly right out of the box.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.920
Angela is calling from Washington.

01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:59.280
I have a feeling I might have talked to you before.

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.560
Yeah, it may be possibly.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:08.680
I don't actually have a question but I thought it would be cool to let you know that back

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:17.520
in 2015 at Linux Fest Northwest, my friend Jenny gave you her Mac laptop and asked you

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:25.220
to fix it, which is laughable in its own and you gave her a Linux laptop.

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:30.280
She has been using that for the last year and a half but not like super well and she's

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:34.920
trying to finish up her AA degree, which she only needs about three or four classes to

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:45.920
complete and she is choosing to go back to school and taking CIS 105 intro to Linux with

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:46.920
that laptop.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:53.040
I thought that you should be able to have that credit and know that she is dabbling

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:57.040
now in Linux to a deeper level.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:58.040
That's outstanding.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:03.360
You know what's funny about that is I think I was the only one participating in that conversation.

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.800
I'll leave this out for you guys.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:10.040
So we're at dinner and her friend Jenny is telling me about how her laptop is having

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.440
some troubles not working.

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.800
Turns out like the motherboard was like totally dead and so I said, if I send you a Linux

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:16.800
computer would you use it?

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:21.920
She kind of looks at me like I'm crazy, two eyes, one eye and she's like yeah, I guess

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:25.760
and so I got back to Grand Forks and I set a computer up and I shipped it off to her

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:29.440
and I get a message from, I think it was, I think you Angela actually sent me a message

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.320
and here's a picture of this computer and she's like why did a laptop just arrive at

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.800
our house and what is it for?

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:38.920
I'm like well, it's for Jenny, it's for Jenny and so yeah, so anyway, so that's how she

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.080
wound up with that computer.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:44.720
It's not a, it's not a, it's not a, you know, any terribly nice computer but it's something

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:48.400
that if you're just using daily stuff I think it gets you along, it gets her along just

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.400
fine, right?

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.400
Yep, it does.

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:55.240
It does and now she's just going to be more confident in it and gosh, I feel like she's

01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:58.680
going to know more about Linux than I will after taking this course.

01:23:58.680 --> 01:23:59.680
Well that's awesome.

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:05.680
Thank you very much for the update and please make sure to give Jenny the number 1-877-3400-11.

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:13.200
I have to memorize my own number.

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:23.640
That would be good, 1-877-3400-11, 1-877-3400-11, someday I'll have that totally memorized and

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.080
I won't have that issue.

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:31.160
I love giving Linux to people that don't have a predisposition to it.

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:34.720
I love giving Linux to people that don't already have it made up in their mind that

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:37.880
they're going to like Linux or they're going to hate Linux, Linux is going to work, Linux

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.600
is not going to work.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.960
The people that can just evaluate it from the standpoint of I have a need, I have a

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:47.960
task, I want to get that task done, how do I do that task?

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:49.680
That's where Linux is going to succeed.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:53.520
Really that's where any operating system succeeds because if you take me as a Linux

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:58.080
user and put me on a Windows environment or a Mac environment, I'm going to have a tough

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.080
time too.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.920
The inspiration for this show is pretty simple.

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:07.280
My company, AltaSpeed Technologies, we've spent the last couple of years perfecting

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:11.560
providing creative cost saving solutions to our customers without sacrificing quality

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.880
using open source software.

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:20.000
We go into a place, to a business that their budget is they spend $500 per workstation

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000
for an office week.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.640
We tell them we're going to provide that to them at nothing.

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.760
They're just going to pay us for their time.

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:31.360
They say that they're paying X amount of thousands of dollars to hire this in-house mail administrator

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:35.920
guy that is going to work on this crappy exchange server that works less than 50% of the time.

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:39.400
We show them other solutions and we're going to take that knowledge and we are going to

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:45.280
morph that into a show and provide those answers to you not at our billing rate of $75 an hour

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:49.040
but we're going to give that to you for free just by calling the number.

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.520
I think this has the potential to morph into a really successful show.

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:58.040
I hope it morphs into a really successful show and so I want to thank everyone for taking

01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.280
the time to be here, for being on the phone lines, waiting on hold, particularly those

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.280
of you that are calling internationally.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:10.600
It is a toll free call though, 1-877-347-0011 so I would never be worried about calling.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.480
It won't cost you anything.

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.840
That will bring us to the end of this week's test episode.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:19.200
Keep that number guys, 1-877-347-0011.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.480
We'll be back with you soon for another couple of test episodes and of course finally the

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:25.120
official launch of the YAS NOAH program.

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.520
Now if you want to support this program as well as the rest of the network, head over

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:29.760
to patreon.com slash today.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.520
You can directly participate in getting this program off the ground.

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:37.320
Special thanks to Sarah, our producer, Ham Radio, our call screener and of course Rekai,

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:40.020
our editor and resident wizard.

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.720

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:46.400
slash calendar and a big thank you to Chris and Wes for giving us this time slot.

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.400
Make sure to tune in next week for their clip segment.

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.320
Have a merry Christmas, a happy new year and I'll see all of you guys on Sunday for our

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:54.840
predictions episode in the next two weeks.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:19.880
You guys have a great night.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:25.440
We have, who do we have here, Ryan, Portland, Port Orchard, Washington.

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.440
Welcome to YAS NOAH.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.440
Hey, how's it going?

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:28.440
Excellent.

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:31.840
How can we help today?

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:38.760
So you mentioned on an episode of last recently that you switched over to ARCH on all your

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:44.200
boxes because you're kind of like little things like functioning network manager and all.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.280
Right, yeah, I'm weird like that.

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.240
I really prefer my wireless to work, yeah.

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.160
What are you trying to live in the future or something?

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:51.160
Come on, man.

01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.160
I know it's crazy.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.320
I'm a whore for the details.

01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:00.720
So I was wondering what made you choose ARCH specifically over something like Ubuntu Mate

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:06.760
which doesn't seem to have all the same issues as standard Ubuntu.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:07.760
A couple of things.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:13.600
The first and foremost factor that really led me to ARCH was these days I move more

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:18.520
and I'm spending more and more time doing things for Jupiter Broadcasting and so it

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:23.600
makes a lot of sense to use the same environment stuff that the other people you're interfacing

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:24.600
with do, right?

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.160
And that was one of the reasons that drew me to Fedora early on is because I was dealing

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:32.560
with so much Red Hat that it just made sense to have Fedora on my desktop and these days

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:35.720
every Sunday at least I'm doing something and if there's an app pic that we're doing

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:40.880
that week it's really nice to be able to have access to the same applications as everyone

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:41.880
else.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:46.880
The other side of it too is that I have some ground to step up on and say, okay, I tried

01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:47.880
ARCH.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:48.880
I ran it for X amount of months.

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:53.320
Here's why it didn't end up working for me and then I can put that baby to rest and I

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.360
don't have to constantly – because right now or at least prior to that it was always

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:01.080
well, I'm using Ubuntu and there's all these people out there telling me that there's

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.880
this better Linux experience available.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.640
Really what I found is I have probably the same amount of problems.

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.920
I just – they are more solvable, number one.

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:14.640
Number two, I expect to have to solve them and number three is they're not – well

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.720
that's not entirely true.

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:20.200
Some of them are kind of show stopping problems but so far they've all mostly been solvable

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:24.560
or tolerable and not having wireless in Ubuntu was not that way.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:30.760
Now as for why I didn't choose Ubuntu Mate, the Mate desktop does not offer the ability

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:33.840
at least out of the box, I think they're including it, to launch an application by

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:38.440
hitting the super key and I have – it is so ingrained in my mind when I want Firefox,

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:43.240
I hit super key, F-I-R-E, enter and then I expect Firefox to be on my screen or super

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:47.480
key, T-H-U-N, enter and I expect Thunderbird to be on my screen.

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:52.720
Without those – it's a difference in how I use the computer and I'm really not willing

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:53.720
to make that change.

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:57.000
Other things you can do, you can use Synapsys, in fact I think they're including Elantra

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:03.020
by default but it's – I see Ubuntu Mate as my utilitarian type distro.

01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:07.320
So the computer I'm on right now for example is running Ubuntu Mate because it's just

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:10.680
an appliance, it's a computer that needs to sit there and it doesn't need to be pretty,

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.480
it doesn't need to switch desktops, I just need to open OBS for example and just have

01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.600
it run.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:24.360
That was not the case, that is not the case with my desktop, on my laptop.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:30.720
So that's the short answer why I wound up on Arch.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:35.200
Mostly happy – the latest thing that really bit me that I was super upset about was I

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:41.120
went to open Lightworks to edit a – or not Lightworks, Inkscape to edit a graphic and

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.120
Inkscape just wouldn't load.

01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:43.840
Like I would click on the icon, nothing would happen.

01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:49.280
So I had to drop to the terminal and then I ran the Inkscape command and then it gave

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.460
me some error that I didn't entirely understand, I had to Google the error and then I'm going

01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:55.560
through and I'm going around and somewhere through there I was like, you know, I have

01:30:55.560 --> 01:31:00.480
some tolerance when it's TeamViewer or some other non-proprietary piece of software but

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:05.760
like Inkscape, Inkscape is like a huge vector graphic, open source vector graphic editing

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:06.760
suite for Linux.

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:11.640
How in the world do you get to a point where you can't – where that doesn't work?

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:12.640
How is that a thing?

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:13.800
It doesn't even make sense to me.

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:31.080
So I was a little upset by that but got it to work and I guess it's worked now so far.
