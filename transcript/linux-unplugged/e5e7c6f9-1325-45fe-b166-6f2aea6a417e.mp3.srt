1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
This was a fun tweet that was sent my way if you're stranded in a weird shell and you're only allowed to bring three commands

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,120
Which ones do you choose boy? There's a lot of good choices out there

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,220
You see tons of folks answering with you know, you need an editor of some type or maybe I'll just bring see

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,500
My favorite answer it was just give me common lisp. Okay. All right. What about you cheese?

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
What would your if you had you could bring up to three commands with you? Which one did you bring?

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,720
probably

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,720
pseudo

8
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,300
Less and

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,960
LS sure, come on. Where's the netcat?

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,640
What about you drew which three commands would you bring

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,640
Probably cat echo and LS our case. He says I'd bring Hollywood. That'd be good. You know that that

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,540
You're not gonna get much work done, but you'll be entertained. How come no one has said apt

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,280
It feels like that's the obvious choice or whatever your package manager of choice is DNF

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,040
Well, if you have a netcat you can just you know bring the archives across and I see you need to live archiver untar

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,160
Or whatever isn't the real answer Emacs. It's got a package manager built

16
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,620
Hello friends and welcome into your friendly Linux weekly talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hi Wes Payne. Hello

17
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,980
Welcome into 353 sir. Oh, I like that number. I know feel so official. Well, we have a really great episode

18
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,220
It's something we've wanted to touch on for weeks and that is your feedback

19
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,740
We got a whole batch of listener feedback this week also have our thoughts on the new pop OS

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:48,300
2004 we've been kicking that around and we'll give you our take on that and we have a new machine that just arrived in the

21
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,740
Studio still in the box. We'll take that out and tell you what laptop we're reviewing next

22
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,940
Plus we have a bunch of community news and so much more to get into so first

23
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:03,900
Let's start by saying hello to the gentleman on the over the internet mic line. Hello cheesy and drew

24
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:09,980
Good to have you guys on board. Hello guys. Hello. Hello. Hello and hello to our

25
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,180
Virtual lug time appropriate greetings mumble room. Hello. Hello

26
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,060
So, let's start with some community news

27
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,940
there's a story that I wanted to bring up to the top of the show sort of flag it to everyone's attention if you have

28
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:32,740
recently installed Ubuntu 20.04 server and chose the encrypted storage option it is possible that that

29
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,940
password you chose for encryption was

30
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,540
Stored in plain text in a log file. Oh

31
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,300
so the fix is out fixes in Wes and

32
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,700
If you grab the most recent

33
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:53,060
20.05.2 dash 1 8 7 4 of this sub equity. I think it's what it's called package

34
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,700
It will fix the problem. It's an installer issue. Just a bit of an oversight. I guess oopsie doodles

35
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,820
Yeah, one of those rather big oopsie doodles actually and it wasn't an intentional thing

36
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,360
It wasn't like some breach or anything about you back door and there's as far as we know

37
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,620
No examples of this information being used in the wild

38
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,300
It was caught during a check and then submitted as a bug and then of course canonical jumped on it

39
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,140
I might have the timing wrong, but I think they went from discovery to fix took them 17 hours or so

40
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,580
I'm not be able to you might be able to check Wes in the launchpad bug. Oh, yeah

41
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,060
It looks like it was reported here 18 hours ago 19 hours ago and the fix was in five hours ago

42
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,860
So that's some 14-ish hours Wow, even better than what I was told clearly something they're taking seriously

43
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,420
Yeah, you know so very good. But just so you know, that is pretty critical. You should probably get that updated

44
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,420
now

45
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,580
Go check if you've already got your system installed

46
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,700
Maybe just go and see if those log files are hanging around and remove them. Hello to Alan Jude

47
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,480
It's good to have you back on the show, sir. Hello

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,180
Hello

49
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,820
Was just saying on the pre show before we actually hit the record button that I've been really enjoying two and a half admins

50
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:04,000
Which is a new podcast with Alan Jim Salter and Joe Resington at two dot five admins comm is that what it is?

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,440
Yep, that's that's our clever domain hack

52
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,860
So clever really good show. It's great to have you and Jim on the same show

53
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:18,060
And I've been enjoying the first two episodes. Let's go check that out. Definitely don't mention ZFS at all. No that never comes up. I

54
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,980
Love it

55
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,100
you know like always Alan you do a great job of explaining the stuff that people are the most interested to know and sort of

56
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,300
Deliver it in a great in the way

57
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,940
You've always done a great job of delivering it since early days of tech snap clear clear breakdown

58
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,740
I love it

59
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,100
And so you then you add that with Jim in there and then Joe has the perspective that maybe a lot of people in the audience

60
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,120
Have which is they haven't yet learned about this. You need someone to ask the questions

61
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,540
Yeah, he's the dot five and the two admins right there. If you didn't catch it. I craves EFS. There you go

62
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,500
So go check that out. It's good to have you here

63
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,020
We have a whole bunch of a whole bunch of people in the virtual leg over 30 people in there today

64
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,560
Which is really cool. Maybe the best one yet. If you'd like to join us, it's at Tuesday

65
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:02,860
It's on Tuesday at noon Pacific over JB life TV and then there's instructions if you just google search

66
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,540
Jupiter colony mumble mumble Jupiter broadcasting. Okay. Okay. Thank you

67
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,860
So it's mumble dot Jupiter broadcasting org and that has the setup guide the trickiest thing about our mumble server is

68
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,140
It's using the old default port not the new default port and if you aren't going to join

69
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,220
Maybe just show up a little bit early make sure you can get your mic checked out get through all of our staging

70
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,460
It's great to see not a guy at work back in there because that's one of my favorite nicks of all

71
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,020
Not a guy at work totally innocent

72
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:35,980
One of the things that got us chatting in our back channels just between Wes I and cheese and drew and everybody else on the team

73
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,300
Was this sort of bold statement made by fedora?

74
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,140
I guess I guess you could attribute it to a statement on fedora's part

75
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,860
This kind of came out. Well not kind of it did come out of a fedora AMA that was conducted on

76
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,980
Telegram and ask me anything where a question was asked

77
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,060
Why is gnome shell the default for fedora workstation?

78
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,740
And then I guess after some reflection they realized, you know

79
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:09,020
We didn't really challenge that underlying assumption and so then a post was created saying that gnome is not the default for fedora workstation

80
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,220
No, it's not the default Wes. Whoa, that's news to me

81
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,220
But let's dig into what they're actually trying to say here

82
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,440
I get it, but I think it will provoke a conversation that I'd like us to get into what they're essentially

83
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:28,340
Asserting is that fedora workstation isn't a box of parts where you choose default options and then blast it onto the hard drive

84
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,140
They say no instead. It's a carefully procured

85
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:38,780
Assemblement of an operating system aimed at developers sysadmins and makers in general if you replace one or more parts of it

86
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,120
Then it stops being fedora workstation

87
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,800
It's not the thing they've created anymore and it starts being a build your own operating system and that's okay

88
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,540
But it's not fedora workstation, right? Then they say this is an important distinction to make

89
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:56,980
It's not that they have some specific goal of creating this exact gnome experience so much as it is an entire

90
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:04,740
Workstation product that is tightly integrated that they test as a whole and it's developed as a whole

91
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,620
It's a mindset of how they create the distribution how they test the distribution how they verify the distribution

92
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,140
Yeah, this post is over on Christian Schaller's blog and you know

93
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,420
He writes having been in the game of trying to provide a high quality desktop experience both

94
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,560
Commercially in the form of rel and through the community efforts around fedora workstation

95
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:29,020
I have seen and experienced firsthand the problems that the mindset of interchangeable desktop creates

96
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,780
For instance before we switch to the fedora workstation branding and it was all just fedora

97
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,580
I experienced reviewers complaining about missing features

98
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:44,360
Features that we'd actually spent serious effort implementing because the reviewer decided to review a different spin of fedora that can know

99
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,060
Mmm other cases. I remember our customers trying to fix a problem by switching desktops

100
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,780
Only to discover that while the initial issue they wanted fixed got resolved now that they've switched

101
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,120
Well, they have a whole bunch of problems and never saw the fix to the first one

102
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,020
yeah, and so for now rel only offers gnome as the default desktop and the same is true in fedora workstation and that's not because

103
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,940
They don't understand that people enjoy experimenting with other desktops

104
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,100
but because it allows them to work with their customers and users and

105
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:18,740
And hardware partners on fixing the issues they have with their entire operating system

106
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,380
Because it's a clearly defined entity and adding features

107
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:29,380
Needed going forward and properly supporting hardware and vendors going forward as opposed to spreading themselves thin

108
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:35,260
They say this is their take on it and just run around putting band-aids on problems that have been reported

109
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:35,700
Yeah

110
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,940
And maybe in the long run this is actually beneficial for people who do want to end up

111
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,080
Customizing their operating system because the team is just focused on you know

112
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,540
A narrow set of things like high TPI support getting wayland ready for the desktop

113
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,700
That's what we talk about all the time or making Thunderbolt work properly on Linux

114
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,720
And when you do have this giant mass of things to focus on it's not just not the same as having a you know

115
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,300
A precise goal that you're trying to polish and get ready to ship as fedora workstation

116
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:07,480
Yeah, and you see this manifest in fedora almost in every release in some way like a recent example

117
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,380
I think has been how they use a system D for the terminal sessions in gnome terminal

118
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,420
No, yeah, which is that's a that's a clear from the GUI all the way down to the low levels of the OS

119
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,740
Integration and there's been other things they when they rolled out like the example

120
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:29,520
He makes Christian makes here is Thunderbolt support when bolt and Thunderbolt D and all of the security stuff rolled out for fedora

121
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:36,600
There was a user facing GUI component in gnome system settings. There was a user daemon

122
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,040
In the lower levels of Linux and there was even some hardware firmware changes for some vendors

123
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,700
It was literally like he's speaking to here hardware vendor

124
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:53,260
assistance lower-level Linux cooperation and GUI implementation and it was executed as a whole

125
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,480
Singular product right and without that. I mean, it's kind of the Linux curse in many ways because we have all these interchangeable parts

126
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,160
Yeah, sure

127
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,200
You know the bolt daemon gets created but you're left on the own for the desktops and well

128
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,720
Maybe eventually plasma does it and who knows who spares the effort on the gnome side to do it?

129
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,000
But when you think of it as a shippable product in this big vertical stack

130
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,880
You're like, well, no

131
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,720
We need to we need to make this work from the bottom on up seems obvious

132
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,480
But it's not generally how we assemble something of a bunch of different parts

133
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,680
And so I guess I can see their point that if you go with this spin of fedora, it's not so much this default

134
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,160
It's that's how that spin is developed. I guess I can get that and it's not like they're not making the plasma spin or other

135
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,120
Spins available. Those are still perfectly easily valid options

136
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,320
But there was something that came up and this is really hard to quantify and I almost debated not even saying it on air

137
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,800
Because it's so silly but in our love plug. We were talking about how when you use

138
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,000
fedora

139
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,460
You can kind of perceive that it's one cohesive product if there's something about it that makes it

140
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,580
Feel like gnome is part of the whole system where most the time when I use gnome or any other desktop on any other distribution

141
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,020
It's like I can perceive there's a separation between gooey and lower level, right?

142
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,540
I mean compared to like a fedora install to just installing, you know an arch. It's not the same

143
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,180
It's not the same. You could put the same theme on there

144
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,860
You can have the same version of gnome shell

145
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,900
You can have the same version of the kernel and the same version of system D

146
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,420
And it still somehow doesn't feel like it's all a single product

147
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,220
that's why I debated not even mentioning it because I

148
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:31,660
I can't really even describe what that experience is but I bring it up because others also felt like they noticed it in the in the

149
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,140
Lug hangout and I thought okay, so it's not just me

150
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,100
It's not crazy Chris right and we talked so much about all the great work that fedora does sort of you know

151
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,220
Shepherding changes in from upstream and taking them together. I think it'd be easy to forget that there is this holistic approach that's going on

152
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,220
Fedora 32 it's so good. Just if you haven't tried it yet

153
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,980
I'll give that a spin because it's a great release

154
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:56,060
maybe you can tell what we're talking about here that that sort of full cohesive product experience now something that was going to be a

155
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,020
Cohesive product that is completely dissolved is ton or ton. I think it's ton

156
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,260
Which was the whole crypto?

157
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,980
Currency experiment the telegram was hurtling towards for the last two and a half years

158
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,300
They write on their blog our best engineers have been working on the next generation blockchain

159
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,420
platform

160
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,380
Called ton right? It was telegram open network, right?

161
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,380
Yeah, a cryptocurrency that they were also going to go with that was going to be grand

162
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,300
so you have the blockchain component ton and then you had Graham the coin and

163
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:36,620
That grand plan for telegram is now over and I think this is really noteworthy because the Linux community is pretty large on

164
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,620
telegram and

165
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:44,060
For the last two and a half years the best engineers as they put it on their very own blog

166
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,660
Have been focused on a cryptocurrency that by all outside accounts was never going to go anywhere

167
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:57,620
anyways, why do so many of the messaging apps seem to want to have a cryptocurrency like I remember was it keybase has been working on

168
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,580
one and

169
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:05,300
Making pop-ups in the app and annoying people that didn't care about cryptocurrencies about it. Although they just got bought by zoom. So who knows? Oh

170
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,540
That hurts so bad I know yeah

171
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,740
um, the other one that gets me and it's also widely embraced by our community is

172
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:22,460
Library or Libri or whatever library their whole system is really it comes down to a coin and when you cash out that coin it

173
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,820
Impacts negatively your search results on library

174
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:33,260
Look this one up go look up how you exchange the library coin. It's cute. You basically have to sell it to a completely

175
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:41,580
Other cryptocurrency something like aetherium or something something that's more widely traded that you can actually then trade elsewhere and it bitcoins too expensive

176
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,200
So go screw yourself. You better go with one of the lower tier priced

177
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,940
Cryptocurrencies then if you're if you're lucky you can either sell that directly into your currency

178
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,840
But more likely what you'll have to do is then sell that

179
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,540
cryptocurrency to buy Bitcoin and then you will have to sell the Bitcoin to actually cash out from library and

180
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,900
This was the same direction Telegram was going down

181
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:10,460
But unfortunately for them, but maybe fortunately for the users the US court decided that grams couldn't be distributed

182
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,100
not only in the US but

183
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,780
globally

184
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,340
Because they said it's possible US citizens would just find another way of accessing the platform after it launched

185
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,540
so to prevent that grams will not be allowed to be distributed anywhere in the world and

186
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:32,340
And while it seems like an excessive extreme overreach that the US law could somehow block

187
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,180
free cryptocurrency trade in other countries

188
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,960
There is a pretty established network of interest that is going to enforce that ruling

189
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,580
Yeah

190
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:46,460
It turns out the dollar is still pretty important as are all the financial institutions here in the States and the way they write about this

191
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,100
Kind of I think betrays where they were going with this

192
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
They write about it like

193
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,340
Yeah, like we found a gold mine and

194
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,740
We were gonna start letting people into our gold mine

195
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,120
He says this is a quote from the blog if this doesn't make sense to you

196
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,580
You're not alone, but this is exactly what's happened with ton the mine, which is ton the blockchain

197
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,180
It's investors and grams, which is the gold a judge used this reason

198
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,660
He'd tell people that they should not be allowed to buy or sell grams like they can buy or sell Bitcoin

199
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,500
They look at this as a gold mine

200
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,460
He writes many people invested in the gold mine because they were looking for profits

201
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,420
They didn't want that gold for the gold themselves. They wanted to sell it to other people because of this

202
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,420
You're not allowed to give them the gold

203
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,100
That's how he's thinking about this. That's that's from him interesting this cryptocurrency thing, which is kind of cool

204
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,500
But there was the peak hype when this launched

205
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:47,540
Was maybe seen as this path to monetization that so many projects seem to be struggling to look for clearly is not gonna happen for Telegram

206
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:52,780
We're writing this post to officially announce that telegrams active involvement with ton is over

207
00:15:53,300 --> 00:16:01,180
You may see or may have already seen sites using the name or the telegram brand or the ton abbreviation to promote their projects

208
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,260
Don't trust them with your money or data course, of course

209
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,700
There's a sketchy

210
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,460
Stealing your money angle to this whole thing to block chain, man

211
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,560
Is there any cryptocurrency that doesn't have a sketchy angle truth that might just be true of currencies

212
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,480
I think about it. Hey when we when you put money on the line, I mean, there's a lot of incentives

213
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,480
Mm-hmm. That's how you know that Bitcoin is like real money because there's just as many scams around

214
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,960
That's very true

215
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,680
Yeah, it is very true. We got to get to the unboxing here in a moment

216
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,440
But I wanted to talk about a little discovery

217
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,400
I had over the weekend

218
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,760
Thanks to mini Mac and Jill in the love plug this Sunday and also a news item that we thought we could cover here

219
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,660
So you remember the Enlightenment desktop right everyone enlightenment, of course. Oh, yeah, it is still going and

220
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,600
Just this week. They launched a new set of their frameworks

221
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,240
EFL think of it as like their version perhaps of GTK

222
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,120
But they would argue quicker better faster and better looking and they've released a new set of their core libraries

223
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,280
We thought well, what a great opportunity to kind of just take a look at

224
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,600
At enlightenment and I was chatting with a love plug like I was saying and I was I was kind of praising

225
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,000
how the things I love about plasma are some of the Kaywin window rules and telling windows to go exactly at this desktop exactly in

226
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
this space every time I open it and

227
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,480
Mini Mac and Jill were nodding. Yep

228
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:30,160
enlightenment can do that enlightenment can do that and then Jill you shared with me one of the features that you found enlightenment to be

229
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,120
Just maybe tops as far as Linux desktops go for all of them is the monitor management

230
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,840
Oh, yeah, they they've been far ahead in that in that area

231
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,800
They have a wonderful screen utility your monitors come up out of the box

232
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:51,300
And this was like ten years ago before distros multi monitor worked really well on distros

233
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,600
Right now I have three monitors one

234
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:02,200
43 inch ultra HD and then two 30 inch monitors on the side in portrait mode and

235
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,000
Enlightenment I've got it all configured in enlightenment and it works just beautifully out of the box

236
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,160
Hmm. I think you mean you need a little more screen real estate there Jill

237
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,200
That's great. Next up. She'll be full VR. That sounds like a brilliant setup

238
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,400
But it must get tricky when doing gaming and stuff, you know, I'm a big gamer

239
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,440
I like to game spanning the three monitors. So it's it's a it's a big deal for that to work because most window managers

240
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
that does not work out of the box and

241
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,600
With with enlightenment it does that's so cool and mini Mac

242
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:41,400
There's a performance aspect to it too. That seems to be super palatable even in a VM. I lose enlightenment as Jill

243
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,420
I lose it on all my multi screen environments, but also on computers that have low specs

244
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,820
So enlightenment comes handy because not only does it use quite?

245
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,680
a small amount of one so my system now on that Toshiba has about a hundred megs of ROM

246
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,980
It's using and enlightenment is so scalable. You can use it on that

247
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:11,980
1024 to 600 pixel laptop and you can use it on a huge machine with like four screens a

248
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,100
Little tidbit you shared with me is there's a reason why themes are slightly trickier on enlightenment

249
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:23,980
But the net result is much better performance. There is a very very special thing that the themes are in fact binary

250
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,900
So that has a very positive aspect. So the whole thing is really

251
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:35,200
Really bleeding fast, but it also has a negative aspect that you don't have so

252
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:42,360
Much themes available for now. You have a an official arc theme that I use that is pretty good

253
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:50,080
Pretty stable. Yeah arcs great. I love arc, but you have you don't have all these fancy teams that you can use without a desktop

254
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:57,840
But these themes that you have are binary and they are bleeding fast and you can use them and it's a breeze to use

255
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,520
It it's really a breeze

256
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,560
Computer could you have a question that I bet is on the mind of a lot of people there?

257
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,880
They're a little skeptical of enlightenment. How would it stack up speed wise to something like i3?

258
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,760
As I never use some tiling window managers. I can't really tell you what I can tell you

259
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,920
It's bleeding fast

260
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,080
and when we talk about tiling managers you have a module in enlightenment where you can

261
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,440
Use a tiling options and the coolest cutest thing is you can in fact define

262
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,340
Virtual desktop to use tiling functions and others use not so we can say

263
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,960
My left monitor using tiling functions and my right monitor does not use tiling functions

264
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,060
Oh snap, that's awesome. So you can see my virtual desktop on screen one

265
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:49,200
Uses tiling functions and my my right screen doesn't so you have

266
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:57,360
Possibilities you can't even imagine you can choose for every application you use you can choose if yes or no you want the window

267
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,540
Decoration then you can use stacking so you can have like an RC

268
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:09,940
IRC terminal open remove the window decoration and put it just on always low

269
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,480
So you have like a living background and you have all the other windows

270
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,840
That you can over your living background and you can roll in windows

271
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,400
So you don't have to minimize them you go into Windows title and you roll up your window mouse and you just see the title

272
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,860
Bar or window shading as it is on plasma. Do you have so many options?

273
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:37,580
You really have to discover and you have to be ready to really crawl to through all the settings

274
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,580
but there's a lot of it and

275
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,720
some of the

276
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Possibilities you have are rather cryptic you get you really have to work

277
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,600
Yourself through the settings, but once you have your setting you will never change it and you will love it

278
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,280
So this is where e live came in

279
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,840
It was recommended to me by you and Jill and you can find it at e live CD org

280
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,480
It is a Debian based preset up enlightenment environment

281
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,840
There's a stable version which I believe uses enlightenment 17 and a beta version which uses enlightenment 16 think and

282
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,880
You can throw it on a VM or on a box and try it out immediately and it's a pre-configured

283
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:23,000
with a nice theme some default options and it walks you through the basics of using the environment with a

284
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,000
with a help walkthrough and it is a

285
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,240
a blast to try this distribution out and I say this in the

286
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,640
Like the most affectionate way it in some ways reminds me of an older era of Linux setups

287
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,600
Yes

288
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,880
That where they really kind of they let you sort of set a lot of options at install

289
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,960
But then nailed the experience when you do it just right so I'm I'm installing it right now

290
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,800
I have it up right here on this computer

291
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:55,440
And it's asking if I'd like the compositor if I'd like conky for the for the resources embedded in the desktop

292
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,640
If I'd like a dock and you walk through these kinds of questions about package sets, would you like chrome chromium Firefox?

293
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,640
Hey, I've detected that this thing supports open GL

294
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,440
Would you like me to turn that on some of these things are just killer for new users?

295
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,520
Yeah, I would have never known how to go figure that out

296
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,220
But I used to love that stuff and now Linux distributions

297
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,920
They just they just do it all for you without even asking really but when I install this I was like, you know

298
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,080
Maybe maybe I will try pale moon this time

299
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,680
I will try and I just checked that box instead of Firefox and it was a really fun

300
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,720
experience because it reminded of the way it used to be installed distributions and at the end you end up with something kind of a

301
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
little bit unique for you and

302
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,520
It was so fast. So Wes and I were playing with this. You got a chance to try it

303
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,520
I did. Yeah, Wes and I were very impressed by it and I thought for myself

304
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,280
I know immediately where I would use this on a daily basis if they made an arm image for the raspberry

305
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
I knew that's what you were

306
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,080
Really would be I mean it makes you

307
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,800
Reconsider like how what you can get out of a machine because like it feels

308
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,280
Pretty modern right and it has a lot of features. It's got the nice dock right on the bottom tons of configurability

309
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,680
Yeah, like this thing right here low resource

310
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,160
Yeah

311
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,920
This thing right here with I have a web browser open in a PDF viewer and it's using 300 megabytes of RAM with the entire

312
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,440
Thing the whole whole thing loaded. That's not bad because it's and it's been sitting there for I don't know a couple hours

313
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,240
So it's not bad and it can scale down below that if you look at some of the screenshots

314
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,720
They've got yeah, and it's one of those. It's one of those desktops that works

315
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,920
Brilliantly, it sounds like if you have multiple monitors, but I've been really impressed a single screen on a laptop, too

316
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,100
So we reached out to the developer of e live thaner to mesas

317
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,320
I think is how you say it. I get that right nicely done thana termesis not easy for me

318
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,500
I had to write it down right here

319
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:44,000
But I wanted to get it right because this is an individual who is working on this distribution by themselves since 2005

320
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,600
I believe and it really showcases what is I think such a classic story in open source where there is

321
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,880
Really really great software out there that does amazing things, but there's no marketing team

322
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,040
There's nobody that's pushing it in any particular channel and it just goes undiscovered

323
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:08,840
That's the enlightenment desktop and the enlightenment libraries which are used by people in the industry who know like

324
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,120
You know embedded markets, but outside of that it doesn't have a lot of general user adoption or knowledge

325
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:21,480
And so something like e live comes along and it showcases this brilliant work, which in itself is also a brilliant work

326
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,960
So I thought maybe I'd share a little bit of the email exchange

327
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,960
he wrote back to us and gave us some inside information about the project and

328
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,920
Than it to mesas writes

329
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,800
It is developed by a single person me and it sometimes receives a bit of help from volunteers in the past

330
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,080
I was able to pay someone, you know a little extra for some development help

331
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,960
But at the moment I'm alone and donations are not enough to pay anyone extra help

332
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,120
and it's the reasons why donations are so

333
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,720
Crucial for the survival of the project and you'll notice that when you go to the download page is it's almost like an elementary OS

334
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,520
Style approach that really asks you to download they have some free options or maybe wait a little while to get the ISO if you

335
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,080
Don't can't donate. Yeah, that's one. That's an interesting approach is

336
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,860
Donate to get the ISO now or give us your email and you'll get an link in an hour and on the beta side

337
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,260
32 bits are free, but the 64 bits version is a donation

338
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,120
But I think this is actually better right then the more insidious ways

339
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:23,120
The distributions could try to make money with tracking built-in advertising god forbid some sort of cockamamie crypto scheme

340
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,560
This I think is a more direct user supported approach

341
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:34,320
But I think he's gotten a lot of pushback on this and people don't really seem to care a lot when you look at the numbers

342
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,120
Of donations that he's getting it's really kind of too bad because I think this is close to his full-time job

343
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,520
It's just trying to keep this thing going. It takes quite a bit of work

344
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,520
It's hard to position a specific role for you life to since it it aims to be better every single release. He writes

345
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,880
This of course doesn't mean that it is the distro to pick for use for maybe developing no JS or to use to deploy

346
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,160
Kubernetes, but since it's based on Debian with good customization and compatibility

347
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,920
You can still use it for any purpose or transform it in to other things. Yeah, and I think that's true

348
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,700
There's actually a Linux insider review just recently in May to quote them

349
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,480
Elive is one of the most multi-purpose and different Linux distributions

350
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,760
You are likely to encounter and it does seem you know, there's all kinds of interesting things out there

351
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:22,480
He mentioned specifically the very powerful customizations to the terminal, which I've not had a chance to try yet

352
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,600
But definitely piqued my interest if you type el underscore and press tab

353
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,000
You'll see a ton of functions that can turn your shell into a powerful framework for development

354
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,200
And I think he uses that to actually develop the operating system itself

355
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,080
And also neat of him is customized right out of the box to be a full IDE suite

356
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,520
As it should be and then like like I was saying sort of more in the era of classic distributions

357
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,640
But in a good way when you're doing the installation towards the end you get asked

358
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,920
You want to install extra drivers and stuff, you know?

359
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
You're kind of familiar with some of these some districts still ask you that stuff

360
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,800
And when specific hardware is detected check this out

361
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,520
It will automatically configure the font sizes based on your screen

362
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:10,320
resolution a dynamic installer of the distro that optimizes for lightness and low-end computers oral enable extra features if it detects the other more

363
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,160
powerful computer and its own persistent system that saves different desktop settings per each different computer detected and

364
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,960
And there's some default customizations for apps and ad blockers

365
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,040
included by default in the browser with tools to automatically fix things like

366
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,680
running out of space and watching for that a possible stuck process and

367
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,600
Detectors for hard disk errors and strong shakings of the computer

368
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,700
There's a good multimedia support optimized video playback based on your graphics card as well

369
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,840
He says I'm sure there's more stuff, but that's some of the highlights. That's a lot of stuff

370
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,600
At

371
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,920
The moment we have the stable and beta versions. They're really different in many senses

372
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:56,360
For example, the stable version is very old but offers the best user experience intuitiveness beautiful and features

373
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,960
Included in the enlightenment 17 desktop. Yeah, that's where it got a little confusing for me

374
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,240
Is the stable version actually has enlightenment 17 and the beta version I guess trying to work on all the underpinnings that's using

375
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
enlightenment 16 for now. Yeah

376
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,040
Enlightenment 16 is loved by many people and deserves a good try for those who've never tried it before

377
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,720
You could see there's so much pride in this work

378
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,200
Absolutely a little bit of defenseness about the donations which seems to be very common in open source projects

379
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,680
but the end result is something that's brilliant and beautiful to use and feels like a

380
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:33,000
Desktop that is different and modern and the funny thing is it's been that way for quite a while, right Jill

381
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,920
Yeah, enlightenment was the first kind of eye candy OS

382
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,780
It was the most beautiful desktop ever created at the time

383
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,640
Yeah, like you were saying, you know

384
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,760
it lives in that world between a lighter X window manager like flexbox and window maker and

385
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,920
Xfce so it lives in that space between memory wise but it's so

386
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,720
Fast and beautiful even though it's not one of the heavier desktop environments

387
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,280
I mean if you've been running genome and you can't stand that there's JavaScript involved at all

388
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,660
Yeah, go for your binary themes and I remember talking about

389
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:15,040
Enlightenment back during Linux action show and I think I had a bias set in and I'm gonna admit it right here

390
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,840
it was simply I

391
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,400
Figured by now that stuff would have broken like it was really good with the software

392
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,160
Compositor and the monitor support back when I was doing Linux action show with Brian

393
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,000
Like that's the last time I probably really looked at it. Seriously, and I thought to myself

394
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,680
Well, I'm sure it's just bit rot over time and that stuff still can't be good turns out

395
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,160
Like they kept with it. That's kind of the amazing thing is I mean

396
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:42,440
Not many other communities. Would you see this sort of its own little ecosystem that can just continue to flourish?

397
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,880
I mean doesn't matter if any anyone's talking about it on podcasts or folks know about it

398
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,440
If it has a dedicated set of users who care about it and get great use out of it. That's enough

399
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,080
Yeah

400
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,240
You got users like mini Mac and Jill who become advocates for because they know it's like there's this really great thing over here

401
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:03,200
That happened so often open source when you got to think too that they also offer for free the 32-bit version

402
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,560
Which if you have an older machine, you know an old netbook or something like that

403
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,700
This would be perfect for it as well. Whereas a lot of distros are dropping that 32-bit support

404
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,200
So it made me want to fire up man Jaro on a pi 4 like a minimal man

405
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,040
Jaro install and then just build my way up to enlightenment

406
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,740
but I know I wouldn't be able to create an experience as good as I witnessed with e live because

407
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,700
Thanatomysus has been working at that for very long time and

408
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,680
Really knows how to work the back-end configuration of enlightenment

409
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,180
but I really want it on a Raspberry Pi because it is in that sweet spot of

410
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,860
like Jill was saying of sort of where XFCE is

411
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,940
Including sort of a slower release cadence, but it's a slow but steady improvement cycle

412
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,800
Do you end up using predominantly GTK?

413
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,540
Applications you mix it mix it all up. Is there is there one?

414
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:59,620
Desktop tool get like cute apps or GTK apps that work better or look better under enlightenment

415
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:05,580
I've had it installed alongside Gnome and KDE as well and haven't really noticed a difference

416
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,700
I mean I run Kdenlive in it without any issues

417
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,060
Theming's not weird or anything?

418
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,580
No

419
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,100
No

420
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:16,740
The only thing that happens is when you boot into it like I have it installed on Ubuntu

421
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,620
Mate too and when you you boot into it, you know all your icons from Gnome come in

422
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,620
but other than that

423
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,560
No, it, you know kind of exists on its own same experience for you essentially MiniMac

424
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:35,100
I on my laptops normally I use Gnome. So I'm pretty used to the GTK environment

425
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:41,900
a cool thing about at least the latest versions of enlightenment is that you don't have a problem with a

426
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,720
Double title bar. So enlightenment can very good adopt right now to the new inline

427
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:54,040
Decorations of the GTK applications fancy you don't face a problem that some QT users

428
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,080
complain that you have to title boys and then you have to work through the problems to

429
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,720
Eliminate one of them. We're all a bunch of filthy multiple desktop users

430
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,180
So ridiculous

431
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,680
well

432
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:14,540
Thank you to the Thanatomysus for taking the time to respond to my questions and if this is all piqued your interest go check out

433
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:19,260
Elive, elivecd.org and if you like what he's doing there kick him a few bucks

434
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,500
I think it's a great example of an open source project showcasing other great open source work

435
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,700
And it really is on the users to make that thing possible. Exactly. So that's pretty great

436
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,220
All right, Wes. What do you say we do a little housekeeping housekeeping? All right, bring it in bring it in. Oh

437
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,620
Yes

438
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,780
You heard us mention that we're live. You heard us mention the lup lug

439
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:44,620
Let's just kind of explain what those are because we're just tossing them around like maniacs

440
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,060
We are live on Tuesdays mentioned that earlier noon Pacific

441
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:53,380
but you can get it converted at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar you go to jblive.tv to watch it and

442
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,300
That's the that's the gist of it. Although

443
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,140
More and more people are really figuring it out

444
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,460
We have a quiet listening section in our mumble room

445
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,700
Which is pretty good audio quality and like the lowest latency you're gonna get it's like you're sitting right here in the studio with us

446
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,220
It's true. So that's another way you can tune in live and it's low bandwidth as well. So that's nice

447
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,580
There's so many ways

448
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,900
But we just love to have you here

449
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:20,640
We have a great chat room going to a bunch of people in there IRC that geek shed net pound at Jupiter broadcasting. Okay

450
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:27,620
That's the live stream. Now. Let's talk about that lup lug lup lug that's happening on Sundays same bat time

451
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:32,580
We do this show on Tuesday. So noon Pacific in the same mumble room just up in the lobby

452
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,980
We get together we hang out for a few hours

453
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:40,540
We get Chris to try enlightenment and it's it's a rather good time. We really enjoy it

454
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,460
So we'd love to have you join us. It's just a way for people to hang out and actually

455
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:48,740
Chat with other Linux users can be refreshing if you don't get an opportunity to do that very much

456
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,300
So that's the lup lug and you just got to get in that mumble room to join us and there is an IRC room as well

457
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,920
We can get details IRC that geek shed net and that is pound

458
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,580
Love lug, it's just nice to have a casual chat, you know, it's no pressure

459
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:07,220
It's not live or anything, but you'll be surrounded by people who also want to talk about Linux. That's right

460
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:13,760
That's right. And then Drew's here with the news on the infinite escape room for Linux. What's this? What is this?

461
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:14,940
What is this?

462
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,940
This is a podcast that

463
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:24,020
Reached out to us on Twitter and they asked for some help getting up and running with Reaper on Linux for their editing

464
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,940
So I talked with them a little bit over Twitter DMS and got them up and running with you know

465
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,500
some Lin VST and some wine and

466
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:41,140
Really just getting them where they needed to be to do their audio editing on Linux and it sounds like they're there

467
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:46,580
They've got it running and everything is good. So I just wanted to give them a shout out and say hey

468
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,580
Congrats guys for moving to Linux

469
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,360
That's amazing. Super cool. I did see that Twitter thread go by and that's super cool that you helped them and I

470
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:59,520
I presume since it's you they were speaking to they're now using Reaper. That is correct. Yes

471
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,720
That is our recording tool of choice for the Linux platform

472
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,760
I mean big props though

473
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,720
It's not easy to go, you know

474
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:11,000
Especially when you're focused on the content to go change up all the tooling that you're using and I know from experience they get into

475
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,480
Working on Linux while it works. Great can be a bit of an adventure

476
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:21,040
So especially if a few of your favorite plugins are Windows based plugin, right now we have a bit of it's a change

477
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,700
But not really one that will really affect the show very much, but I'm excited to announce that mr

478
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,240
Wes Payne ladies and gentlemen has a new day gig

479
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,760
West congratulations

480
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,640
But not much is changing for the show really is it no not at all

481
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,280
I'm going back to the world of software development full-time

482
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,920
So I'll be leaving a cloud guru as an employee

483
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,160
But I'm certainly not leaving the Jupiter broadcasting community and definitely not the show now

484
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,040
I'm really glad that you were able to continue staying here for the show because

485
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:55,360
Since episode 100 it's kind of become a thing with I know I can't quit it. No, you can't I noticed you got these shackles installed

486
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,920
Yeah, if you just sit right there forever just so I can make sure you won't go anywhere

487
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,640
No, no, no, it's we we've chatted about it. I think it's gonna work out pretty good. I'm very happy for you

488
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,240
I'm glad you're able to get a new gig that's back in the software development field

489
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
And I think you're gonna enjoy it quite a bit

490
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,160
but it does bring up a rather particular challenge and

491
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,640
That is you got to give back that laptop

492
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,720
So let's talk about that, but that right there. We'll leave that for the housekeeping

493
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,320
That's officially the housekeeping this week

494
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,400
but let's talk about what we're gonna do about this think pad because that is a work machine and

495
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,760
That's got to go back. I miss it already. But wouldn't you know it?

496
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,560
We got something new that just came into the studio this week

497
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:38,960
So sent in by Dell go ahead and take it out of the box there Wes and tell me tell me what we got there

498
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,680
There you go. Oh, yeah open it up here. Oh, it's very silver. It is very silver

499
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:51,480
Mm-hmm. This looks like the latest new model of the XPS. Oh, it is indeed Wes. It is the new XPS 13

500
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,660
It's got one finger open kind of sort of

501
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,800
And look at that screen so that's got the new edge to edge screen and the edge to edge keyboard

502
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,460
So it's just nothing but laptop and the new fingerprint reader up in the top corner

503
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,960
Which looks really nice same carbon fiber feel to it, but even more metal now

504
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,280
I mean, they've got these fancy chamfered edges. Yeah, isn't that looking super? Wow. Yeah

505
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,400
It looks like a really high-end product now with those shiny edges

506
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,320
So Wes Payne

507
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:26,440
What good timing for you to review a new laptop and tell us what it's like to set it up for a software development job

508
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,680
And maybe a little casual gaming. What do you say? I think that sounds like a challenge. I'm ready to take on there

509
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,760
You have it. So we'll either have it next week or shortly thereafter the West Payne take on the new XPS

510
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,600
13 so that should be really cool coming with me buddy getting used and abused Wow

511
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,920
Look how much put that next to the ThinkPad there. Look how much thinner that is

512
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,840
Holy smokes that XPS is almost just the size of the top of the ThinkPad

513
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,200
It's that's wild and it's like 75% in the just in the area of the thing

514
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:02,760
So the ThinkPad is a 14 inch. Yeah, so it's a slightly slightly bigger screen, but no question about it

515
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,160
Just even from across the table here. I can tell you that XPS 13 screen is way better. Hey better

516
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,420
Yeah, we'll find out about onboard sound and things like that. You know, that'll be in the testing

517
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,760
Yeah, I'll be curious on the whole West Payne tank take because that's got the 10th gen

518
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:24,100
Intel processor which people are claiming has a decent as far as decent in integrated graphics goes has decent performance

519
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,260
You've been playing on the ThinkPad with seventh generation, right? Is that what it is? Yeah, so this should be a big GPU

520
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:34,520
I'm excited to give it a try. Mm-hmm curious to know how all the setup goes for the new gig and all that

521
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,000
Of course, eventually we'll have to send it back, but we'll wipe it. We'll wipe it

522
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,080
Just a great opportunity to do really give that. Yeah

523
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,520
I mean I keep watching these things evolve and of course I had XPS way back when yep

524
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,360
So I know it's been a good line

525
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,600
I'm seeing you know what it work is my day today. Was it the first model XPS?

526
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,920
It was yeah the first model says this is gonna be really interesting to get your take on this one stuff

527
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,760
Cool, so we'll have that in a future show, but now

528
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,520
What do you say? We talk a little pop OS 2004. Oh, it's beyond time for that now

529
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,160
I was a little spoiled because I got to play with it on the new lemur pro

530
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,480
So I really got to see it in its prime when it's on system 76 hardware

531
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,140
But I think that's worth talking about for a moment

532
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,880
So there's a couple of standout features that I think you guys will probably also echo

533
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,340
But I'd like to just give a little attention to here off the top and that is the new pop shell tiling tool

534
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:29,100
you heard us talk about it we were the first to interview system 76 and get information out there about it and

535
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:35,780
Turns out it's totally rad. It's rad and how it's been created to they're using typescript to write this thing

536
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,400
Which means in theory, I think a lot tighter safer JavaScript on the end. Yeah, right

537
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,640
I mean in a nice first-class development experience

538
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:49,000
Absolutely, and that feature alone is implemented in a really slick way that just makes it worth trying out

539
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,200
even if you just get a the latest version of gnome shell and install this extension, it's it's really neat because it's

540
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:02,000
Integrated in the top menu. Yeah, click that little sucker and then there's just one button toggle on one button toggle off

541
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,440
Yeah, just says tile windows. And there you go that one simple obvious

542
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,200
Fantastic feature is what makes this a totally actual

543
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,220
Usable feature for me that I will really use because there's certain workflows where I want free-floating windows

544
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:21,800
And I want control over everything where it's positioned and there's other times where it's just a keyboard day

545
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,160
My hands not coming off the keyboard go ahead and tile it for me. So I've got it right here

546
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:30,040
I've been using it while we're doing the show and I was using a note-taking application that had a little sub menu that just was

547
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,660
Not playing nicely with tiling super simple to go pop that off get my work done when I'm done with that app pop tiling back

548
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:40,800
On and I'm set up in show mode that feature alone is worth trying even if you're familiar with tiling window managers and whatnot

549
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,100
It's just fun to see how they implemented that and I think they're gonna just add more to it

550
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:51,320
It's got absolutely plus you can configure the spacing around the windows and especially with some of the just as a contrast to some

551
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:56,160
Of the more, you know low-level tiling window managers where you're customizing it in Lua or you know

552
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,880
Something that takes a lot more learning. This is just an easy mouse click away to configure about how you like

553
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,160
Yeah, and you're still a num shell too

554
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,640
So there's that's a lot more appealing to a lot of people other things in there are really nice to have

555
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:14,800
I feel like 2004 Ubuntu 2004 is just a really great release, but there's still some differentiation there with pop pop shop

556
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,800
I think stands out as

557
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,200
What seems to be maybe another round of thought and pass that went into the default selection of apps?

558
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
When I open up pop shop

559
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,160
Literally, probably three out of the five top apps

560
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,360
I have to install immediately to make this a work machine are right there

561
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,840
And then after I have those installed what it replaces them with completes the picture

562
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,600
it's pretty rare and it includes proprietary stuff and open source stuff and

563
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,880
They've really gone all-in on flat packs, but the way it's implemented the user never really has to be concerned with it

564
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,520
You know, honestly so far, you know

565
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,380
We've just been doing just stock 24 and fedora like the pump shop. It's been the best experience by far

566
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:58,840
No, it doesn't feel slow. There's no random sluggishness things queue up in a very natural way and all the software

567
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,240
You want is right there

568
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,960
Normally I give up and just use that back on the command line

569
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,120
But I didn't have to and just flat hub being installed by default is a nice touch

570
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,480
It makes it a little bit quicker to get running the other thing

571
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,880
I really appreciate that I implement on every desktop environment today except for plasma and gnome

572
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,720
now is they included a pretty great launcher super key plus forward slash and

573
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,720
It launches a quick responsive launcher that is definitely faster than stuff built into gnome

574
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,280
I think I'm probably just gonna stick with gnome at this point

575
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,400
I've built that muscle memory, but that's the kind of little stuff

576
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,680
They're adding that I think really shows you system 76 is thinking a little bit deeper about a particular niche

577
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,720
Jack Wallen has a take that will link in the show notes and in there he writes system 76

578
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,520
Understands that their target audience wants to keep their fingers and hands at the keyboard

579
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,600
Why it's more efficient instead of shifting from the keyboard to the mouse and back again

580
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:58,000
Things go much more smoothly when you can keep those digits pounding and he's right

581
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,480
You're seeing features like the tiling like the launcher

582
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,520
Not everyone likes that but they're kind of being bold here in a way

583
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:12,240
They're going particularly add a certain demo of users in an aggressive way that I like to see and I think adds genuine

584
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,720
differentiation between stock Ubuntu and

585
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,560
Long-term I think could potentially be great for main

586
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,760
Ubuntu mainline Ubuntu because they could Sherlock the crap out of this stuff

587
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,520
They can sit here and watch system 76 essentially market test this stuff in a particular niche

588
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,880
That's tolerant to these types of tests and watch what does well

589
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,600
And then just nab that feature and roll it into mainline Ubuntu that's called Sherlocking

590
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:45,000
Which is a term that's been coined because Apple does that with Mac OS and iOS they watch what independent developers create

591
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,200
They take the most successful ideas and then they just incorporate into their own OS and they make it part of the platform

592
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,600
Canonical has that opportunity here with the innovations that are happening in pop and pop shell etc

593
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,440
They can watch that and say, you know what things like game remote. Maybe we should ship that by default

594
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:05,240
Yeah, very true. I've also just been impressed with how accessible it is for tiling in general

595
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:10,440
It doesn't feel like some obscure super user type thing. It's just another way to interface with your desktop

596
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,880
That's a really good way to put it. It doesn't feel like you're all of a sudden becoming an elite hacker. Exactly cheesy

597
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,360
I know you've spent a lot of time with pop. I'd like to hear your thoughts on the 2004 release

598
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,520
I spent a considerable amount of time with it

599
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,960
Been living with it on the ThinkPad now for a couple of weeks to two and a half weeks something like that

600
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:32,680
Also living with it on the Thalia that I was gifted from system 76. So that upgrade process was painless

601
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,680
Tiling extension the pop shell is great. And I think it's a great

602
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,740
Entry level for someone who doesn't know if they want a tiling window manager doesn't want to necessarily go full i3

603
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,320
Maybe just wants to experience it first all the keyboard shortcuts are sane

604
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:55,760
And there's nothing just super crazy in the keyboard shortcuts. The terminal is added to your favorites by default. Thank you

605
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,800
Nice, the dot matrix wallpaper is super cool

606
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:04,400
I love it one of the cool things that I really like about pop and it makes sense to me

607
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,480
Because of the market that they're delivering these machines to is that it's an opt-in

608
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,000
Kind of disk encryption on the installer

609
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,920
You can opt out of it by hitting a checkbox, but by default

610
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,700
Disk encryption is turned on. This is where you need to be people

611
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,760
you need to be encrypting your your drives and obviously if they're selling to

612
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,640
People that are developing equipment for space or whatever that you know

613
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:37,560
You would want to have that disk encrypted in case that machine was ever lost for some reason a couple things

614
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:42,220
It didn't really care about and you know, it's just personal preference sort of thing

615
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:46,860
It doesn't default to detailed view. It's still icon view in

616
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:52,500
Gnome files. Oh, I hate that. That's where it always goes first right whenever I open up gnome files

617
00:46:53,260 --> 00:47:00,740
There are still a few issues, you know with pop shell and I expected it to be that way if you're resizing windows splitting windows

618
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:06,340
And those sorts of things you'll run into issues where certain applications don't tile properly

619
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:11,900
So you'll kind of have to you know mess around with it a little bit to find that happy medium for you

620
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:18,660
Obviously if you've got a large 4k screen, it does help out with the screen real estate. So you're not crunching down

621
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:23,740
Gnome files to a you know, super small tile and the you know

622
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:28,540
Making it basically impossible to navigate through files, but overall it's it's really a solid

623
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,820
Distribution it makes sense that they would

624
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,380
Do what they've done with pop shell

625
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,580
For the for the audience that they're targeting with their hardware

626
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:42,060
So I think they've done a great job and it's built on top of 2004

627
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,100
Which as you mentioned has been a rock-solid release

628
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:51,260
So I've been thrilled with it and it's gonna remain on my Thalia and it's gonna remain on my laptop for quite a while

629
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,860
That's the ultimate testament is if you stick with it

630
00:47:54,100 --> 00:48:00,260
And I don't I don't know for me because where pop sort of seems to be

631
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:06,500
Landing in my spectrum of distros is right where I have Manjaro right now. That makes sense

632
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,060
I think pop has a better out-of-box experience

633
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,660
but in

634
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:17,300
Three months. I know I'll be happier on Manjaro just because all the little things hooked on rolling and

635
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:22,860
You know with with an AUR wrapper. You can really just install anything under the Sun. I I

636
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,300
Was spending 10 minutes like a dope over the weekend

637
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:33,580
Googling for a Cups PPD file for my brother laser printer when it dawned on me that of course

638
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,100
It's in the AUR

639
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:40,580
Everything's in the AUR and I just installed it and I was ready to go and I got right to printing which was like the first

640
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:42,540
Time I'd print it in two years. I think you animal

641
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,340
Well, it should be said too that on the other drive in the ThinkPad there is Manjaro

642
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,540
You know, it's like West always says it's not the distro. It's how you use it. I

643
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,060
Do think you're right about the pop out-of-box experience

644
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,940
I was especially impressed with the installation. It just felt super friendly streamlined

645
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:03,940
Honestly, I think it's like my favorite install experience on any OS so far fair point

646
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:09,940
It has the best installer the best art. It looks the best it has the most consistent look and feel

647
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:16,740
You can really tell that they have talented people on their team and they're pointing some of them at this thing and saying or them

648
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:23,700
And saying make it consistent make it a product and it feels like it much like fedora does

649
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,340
I just in a different kind of branded way, right?

650
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:30,780
I think we were a little skeptical at first pop was announced like what where's the value add white?

651
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:35,000
But it's exactly that sort of focusing on it as a product combined with some of their hardware

652
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:41,040
Yeah, it's there and then lastly I'll just add with the the lemur Pro the most direct experience

653
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:46,920
I had being benefit that it was a pop OS install on system 76 hardware with the lemur was

654
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,460
The firmware update they needed to issue

655
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:54,340
Early into the review cycle of the machine that changed the fan curve

656
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:59,980
That was a very cohesive experience. It felt top-grade

657
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:05,740
I mean it felt just as good as anything you would experience from any vendor that has been doing this for 15 years already

658
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:11,380
During the flashing process that came up with a graphical system 76 screen with a console output

659
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:16,700
It wasn't just like some UEFI output on this on the command line. We had

660
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,940
Jeremy on last week

661
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:22,620
talking about the the lemur and we kind of briefly

662
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:28,000
Touched on the the keyboard and a lot of these keyboard shortcuts for pop shell

663
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:32,220
Kind of play into this new keyboard that they're manufacturing as well

664
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,420
So I'll be interested to see you know

665
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,220
how that all

666
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:40,000
Turns out and I'm sure I'll be the proud owner of one of those keyboards whenever they do start to ship too

667
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,940
So I think if you you know, if it works for you, it's a great one

668
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,700
I think for me, I'll probably stick on Manjaro

669
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:51,740
But keep a close eye on what pops doing to now. I really have like just have all the choices

670
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,900
So I'm doing good. We got a feedback in you want to switch to feedback West. It's

671
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,660
It's apropos as they say indeed says hello guys. I was just listening to episode

672
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:09,140
343 what Linux is best at the pop OS tiling window manager extension chapter made me wonder if you'd come across to paper

673
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:15,740
WM or paper whim it's a gnome extension that provides a decent tiling window manager experience

674
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,940
I've been using it daily for a few weeks

675
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,980
It works well on pretty much stock Ubuntu 1910 installation in my case and looks like it's under heavy development

676
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:31,260
Richard also wrote in on gnome and tiling says I just wanted to say that I was listening to the one-click trap episode and you

677
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:35,140
Mentioned a tiling window manager for gnome shell. I think we've been talking about this

678
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:42,700
I'm getting the sense. So this is a topic system 76 isn't the only one out there and some of them are really polished such as

679
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,180
paper WM and

680
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:52,100
Mosaic a new contender enters the ring West mosaic. You should check them out and review the gnome shell extensions

681
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:56,500
You know when we got these feedback actually did go and install paper WM because why not, you know

682
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:01,420
You just go clone their repository run the install script and it'll install for you. And yeah, it looks pretty nice

683
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:07,900
Maybe a little less user friendly than than the pop shell is but if you want perhaps a little more full featured tiling

684
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,180
Definitely worth a try. Ah

685
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:13,660
So if you are even hardcore on the tiling side of things, but don't want to step away from you know

686
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:18,400
That's a weird use case. Who is that user? Yeah, I took it. These people are

687
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,380
Richard and Chris are so then we have gammas dot file tool

688
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:26,300
Which I thought would be a cool one to kind of cap us off today. You ready for this one?

689
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:32,700
Yeah, if you're like me and use git for version control and sharing your dots you probably have a few things you want to keep

690
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,220
Private nearly everyone has an SSH config and a lot of people here need their mumble.com

691
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,860
Great point. Oh boy

692
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,460
We just always delete it but that's not the right

693
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:47,700
It's not which is one of the reasons it has your private cert in there

694
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:52,220
Which was what all of the permissions for mumble once you've been verified and like voice or you know

695
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:56,860
A mic check and all of that your certificate says you're good and then when you delete that config you lose that

696
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:02,020
He uses get crypt it uses gets filter attribute to encrypt

697
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:09,140
Transparently so you can host all of your dot files in one public repo without worrying about people stealing your sensitive data

698
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:13,300
if someone checks out the repo the encrypted files are simply checked out and

699
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:19,800
Encrypted unless they have the key and the git crypt unlock and then git crypt unlock the repo

700
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,120
Do you have you looked at this? No, you know, I've seen it floating around there

701
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,320
But I've never actually used it in any of my workflows and it does seem like a nice way to do it

702
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:32,120
You know if you don't have ways to separate that stuff fully out there or you have to compose them together when you you know

703
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,040
Reinstall stuff just leave it right there and then get handle it

704
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,880
I wonder if I was going to use get say to back up my configs and my dot files

705
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:45,200
I think that might be where I drew the line and just did a little self hosted git lab and

706
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:51,240
And I suppose I'd still care about security, but I just don't know if I want to put that stuff on a public

707
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:57,760
Yeah, I suppose it depends on the line two of which configs do you need secrets in and which do you really feel value and sharing?

708
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,600
You know if you've got a lot of

709
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,400
Customizations or nice hacks to your VM RC that you want to share with folks out there

710
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,440
Versus something maybe like mumble comp where it really is just one of your personal details

711
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,440
I think if I was doing a general dot file backup like that

712
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:14,240
I would be concerned that eventually something would end up in there sort of like we started the show with that

713
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:21,680
Installer error that wrote by mistake the encryption password in plain text like you just sometimes it's easy to have happened to even experienced users

714
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,680
You don't know what's going in there like sometimes applications. Just put something dumb in there

715
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,000
I think I'd want it encrypted, too

716
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,480
So I think this is a great a great tip by a gamma so gamma

717
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,800
Thank you for saying that along and again

718
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,200
It's git crypt this seems like another opportunity for folks to give some feedback to us to you know

719
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:40,200
This is a common problem if you're not using git crypt. What are you using? Yeah?

720
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:45,840
How are you doing this and is it necessary to use git for this or would our sync?

721
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,580
Just do the job and to like say a sync thing directory is that crazy

722
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,240
That just seems like maybe a simpler approach

723
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,740
Yeah, I mean, I think there's a forget users folks who already work with git every day

724
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,100
There is sort of a you know when you have this hammer

725
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:05,400
Then probably what you just said is it because I probably use our sync more than I use git right and git has you know

726
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,640
Versioning baked into it right yeah, that seems like the big advantage

727
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,760
Yeah, for sure interesting Linux unplug calm slash contact for how you do it or anything else

728
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:20,240
We've talked about recently that you'd like to chime in on including any questions you have for that XPS 13 that vessel

729
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,240
Oh, please do let me know yeah, putting it through the ringer probably another way to let you know is on Twitter

730
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,200
Yeah, that's right at Westpain, and I'm at Chris las you can go check me out over there

731
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,040
Let me know what's up check out my website Chris last calm. That's happening, too. I don't know maybe there's something going on

732
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,920
There you didn't know about I don't know there's only one way to find out. I'm not the boss of you not yet

733
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,200
That's right. That's right

734
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:48,960
Well congratulations again to you sir. Thank you. I am looking forward to hearing your takes on that XPS 13 as well as more feedback

735
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,800
I love doing that so please get all that sent in we have links to just about every dang thing

736
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,360
We talked about today at Linux unplug calm slash

737
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:03,880
353 that's this episode and of course I encourage you to subscribe at Linux unplug calm slash subscribe

739
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:34,360
It's new. I think you're really gonna like it check it out Linux unplug calm subscribe. There's only a little bit of XML

740
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,800
I

741
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,160
Thought it was gonna be an Oprah moment there whenever you let Wes unbox the XPS

742
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,920
I thought you're gonna be like, you know, you get a laptop you get a laptop, you know

743
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,480
If I could afford I'd get him a laptop

744
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,480
