WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
So this is one of those weeks where all three of us

00:02.000 --> 00:03.840
have kind of fallen in love with a new distro.

00:03.840 --> 00:06.240
We're all feeling that new distro energy right now.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.360
Yeah, I'll admit it.

00:07.360 --> 00:08.320
Thanks, Chris.

00:08.320 --> 00:09.600
I can totally tell Brent's feeling it

00:09.600 --> 00:12.120
because it's been like link after link after link

00:12.120 --> 00:13.400
this morning.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.680
And he, well, he told us that, too.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.360
He's actually even making songs.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.360
He's made songs to honor his new distro

00:19.360 --> 00:20.600
that he's fell in love with.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.160
Well, when I listen to any music now,

00:22.160 --> 00:24.680
I just can't stop thinking of my new love, you know?

00:24.680 --> 00:26.400
You just can't stop that feeling, Brent?

00:26.400 --> 00:27.260
Is that what it is?

00:27.260 --> 00:28.560
I'm hooked on a feeling, Chris.

00:28.560 --> 00:29.320
I'm hooked.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.960
Oh, you're hooked on a feeling.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.440
Ha, ha, ha.

00:32.440 --> 00:43.360
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk

00:43.360 --> 00:43.640
show.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.440
My name is Chris.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.520
My name is Wes.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.480
And my name is Brent.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.680
Hello, guys.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.520
Thanks for joining me on what is going to be an adventure,

00:50.520 --> 00:53.880
a discovery, if you will, an emotional journey

00:53.880 --> 00:54.920
into a new distro.

00:54.920 --> 00:56.120
OK, maybe not quite.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.560
Maybe we're oversold a little bit.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.320
But we have met a new distro.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.920
And it's no average Linux distribution.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.800
This week, we're going to announce the Nyx challenge.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.960
We'll have details on that in just a little bit.

01:06.960 --> 01:08.840
And we're going to give a go at explaining why

01:08.840 --> 01:11.000
we think Nyx is interesting.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.080
And even if you never plan to use it,

01:13.080 --> 01:15.600
maybe just try to give you a mental framework

01:15.600 --> 01:18.160
to think about why people find it interesting.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.880
And then we'll round it out with some great boost, maybe

01:20.880 --> 01:23.000
some picks, maybe some more.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.600
So before we go any further, before we

01:24.600 --> 01:25.960
get into any of that, let's bring

01:25.960 --> 01:28.240
the virtual lug that is packed today.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.000
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.480
Hello, hello.

01:30.480 --> 01:31.160
Hello, hello.

01:31.160 --> 01:31.880
Hello, Brent.

01:31.880 --> 01:32.400
Hello, Wes.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.080
Hello.

01:33.080 --> 01:33.640
Howdy.

01:33.640 --> 01:34.280
Hello.

01:34.280 --> 01:34.800
Hello.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.760
Hello.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.720
Hello, thank you in there, everybody, for joining us.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.200
Can you feel it in the air?

01:40.200 --> 01:42.520
It's fresh distro season.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.400
GNOME 42 is officially out.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.120
New things are happening.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.480
It's like springtime.

01:48.480 --> 01:53.000
Everybody's planting their open-source gardens right now.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.800
I guess I'm in a good mood, I guess.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.080
Yeah, I mean, well, you should be.

01:57.080 --> 02:00.600
It's been one of those weeks where, behind the scenes,

02:00.600 --> 02:03.800
we've just been really nerding out super hard.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.560
So it's like, we finally get to come on air

02:05.560 --> 02:07.020
and talk about the thing that we've

02:07.020 --> 02:08.640
been enjoying all week long.

02:08.640 --> 02:09.960
But where do we start?

02:09.960 --> 02:11.680
And the other thing that we've been waiting

02:11.680 --> 02:14.960
to do since last episode is give another go

02:14.960 --> 02:18.480
at getting Linux on the M1 MacBook Max.

02:18.480 --> 02:20.960
This is a decked-out MacBook Max.

02:20.960 --> 02:24.320
And last week, we attempted to install the Asahi Linux

02:24.320 --> 02:25.080
Alpha.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.200
We really did.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.480
But there was a file system corruption issue.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.240
Yeah, I don't know what you've been doing with this thing,

02:30.240 --> 02:32.200
buddy, but actually, no.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.320
Apparently, at least as Hector Martin tells it,

02:35.320 --> 02:38.080
this is more common than we might have thought with APFS,

02:38.080 --> 02:39.400
which is too bad.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, he kind of tweeted that right after the show came out,

02:42.000 --> 02:44.520
that, yeah, we're hearing this from several people.

02:44.520 --> 02:47.120
And we actually got that file system issue

02:47.120 --> 02:48.880
resolved right after the show.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.280
But we decided to hold up.

02:50.280 --> 02:51.560
We just hold up right there.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.580
We're not going to go any further.

02:52.580 --> 02:55.400
We would wait till we were recording again to resume.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.700
So Wes Payne, brace yourself, because it

02:57.700 --> 03:03.080
is time to install Linux on the MacBook Max.

03:03.080 --> 03:03.760
Here I go.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.160
How are you feeling about it this week?

03:05.160 --> 03:06.360
I think you're probably feeling better, aren't you?

03:06.360 --> 03:06.680
Yeah, good.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.360
I mean, I'm hopeful there won't be any booting into recovery

03:09.360 --> 03:12.440
and having to learn, refresh myself on disk util

03:12.440 --> 03:14.040
like last week.

03:14.040 --> 03:14.560
We'll see.

03:14.560 --> 03:18.360
I mean, the APFS FSEC did complete.

03:18.360 --> 03:21.160
And the installer now walked in just enough

03:21.160 --> 03:23.200
to see that it sees the new free space and partition

03:23.200 --> 03:24.080
we were able to do.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.180
So I don't know.

03:25.180 --> 03:27.240
There could still be more dragons lurking here.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.920
So how much disk space are you given the Linux install?

03:30.920 --> 03:33.720
What have you decided to allocate to it, do you recall?

03:33.720 --> 03:36.040
Because I think we have about 1.5 terabytes

03:36.040 --> 03:40.400
free on the internal disk on that thing, which, you know,

03:40.400 --> 03:42.520
there's no upgrade in that storage.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.160
Yeah, we have 1.9 terabytes.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.880
I gave it 80 gigs.

03:46.880 --> 03:47.480
Oh, OK.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.880
I was just being, I wasn't sure.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.120
Yeah, no, that's fine.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.160
We can always massage, too.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.160
All right.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.680
So we've been looking at our different options.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.320
We think we're going to go with, what, maybe the minimum?

03:58.320 --> 04:00.000
Or are you going to try to go all the way up to the desktop?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.560
You're going to go for desktop?

04:01.560 --> 04:02.240
I think you probably should.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.640
We should probably go for desktop, right?

04:03.640 --> 04:03.920
Yeah.

04:03.920 --> 04:05.560
I was thinking minimum, because that's

04:05.560 --> 04:06.920
how I think I'm going to be using this,

04:06.920 --> 04:07.880
is like a headless setup.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.320
But you might still want the desktop for troubleshooting,

04:10.320 --> 04:11.000
or, you know.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.560
I think we should go desktop.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.320
All right.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.240
OK, Wes Payne, we'll check back in with you momentarily.

04:16.240 --> 04:22.720
So he'll have that going during the show.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.040
We'll check back in to see if we manage to get Asahi Linux

04:25.040 --> 04:25.800
on that sucker.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.600
And it's funny, because back in the day,

04:27.600 --> 04:30.760
you might go buy yourself a big ThinkPad, or Dell,

04:30.760 --> 04:33.440
or maybe even a System 76, and your goal

04:33.440 --> 04:36.240
would be to dual boot Windows and Linux on there

04:36.240 --> 04:38.600
for those few things you still needed Windows for.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.600
And now here we are in 2022, and the situation

04:41.600 --> 04:42.360
is sort of flipped.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.880
It's now you can dual boot Mac OS and Linux,

04:45.880 --> 04:48.280
which I could see that working for a lot of people.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.920
And then you also can at least have

04:50.920 --> 04:52.800
the option of Apple's hardware.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.320
Although I'm not convinced yet.

04:55.320 --> 04:59.680
It's still the values there for Linux users, but we'll see.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.800
I want to mention that we have a meetup just

05:01.800 --> 05:05.160
around the corner on April 9 in Raleigh, North Carolina.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.040
Details at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.160
It's just outside Raleigh.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.040
There's going to be a park that we'll meet at,

05:11.040 --> 05:14.280
and there is a barbecue joint and a brewery there.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.960
What more could you ask for?

05:15.960 --> 05:17.000
There's a lot of people.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.600
So Brent is booked.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.600
He's official, Wesley.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.760
Now you've got to get yourself.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.920
Oh, I'm booked too.

05:21.920 --> 05:22.640
What?

05:22.640 --> 05:24.800
Congratulations, gentlemen.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.160
How exciting is that?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.680
That's really fun.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.400
Wow, it's going to be a good showing,

05:31.400 --> 05:36.320
because I think we have already something like 70 people,

05:36.320 --> 05:37.720
72 people on the meetup.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.440
Yeah, I mean, it'd be rude not to go, right?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.600
So we're getting to the point where

05:40.600 --> 05:43.560
if you think you can make it, do sign up to the meetup.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.440
I know it's a pain in the butt, but please do.

05:45.440 --> 05:49.560
So that way, we can give the barbecue place a heads up,

05:49.560 --> 05:52.680
because there's a lot of meat that's going to be required.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.240
And Brent's going to help you out.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.920
He's going to skip meat for that night just for you

05:56.920 --> 05:57.800
guys out there.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.080
We're still going to need better numbers.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.080
Yeah, thank you, Brent.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.000
Thank you for doing that.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.040
So meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.240
I'm looking forward to it, because Alex and I

06:06.240 --> 06:08.560
are going to try to record a self-hosted in person.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.600
Ooh, a rare treat.

06:10.600 --> 06:14.080
And if we got the opportunity, I think

06:14.080 --> 06:16.240
he has enough microphones that we could all

06:16.240 --> 06:18.160
kind of sit down all the Friday stream

06:18.160 --> 06:19.800
and record something too, possibly.

06:19.800 --> 06:20.720
Oh.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.600
So anything like that would probably end up on the extras,

06:23.600 --> 06:25.840
extras.show, I would think.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.320
So even if you can't make it, maybe

06:27.320 --> 06:28.760
we'll try to get some of the content published

06:28.760 --> 06:29.600
over there or something.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.600
We don't have any specific plans at this point.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.400
There's even an RSS for it.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.160
If you can't make it to that meetup,

06:35.160 --> 06:36.600
we do have something even sooner.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.560
It's the week this episode is airing, just a couple of days.

06:39.560 --> 06:43.880
March 31, I am holding a live stream at jblive.tv.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.120
It's an opportunity to just sort of do an AMA

06:46.120 --> 06:48.960
if you've got any questions related to the shows

06:48.960 --> 06:50.400
or to the network.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.240
That's a Thursday.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.080
What time is it?

06:52.080 --> 06:56.080
4 PM in Seattle, 7 PM in New York, 11 PM in London.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.880
And I'll also be giving away some Bitcoin

06:58.880 --> 07:01.320
to help people get their lightning wallet set up

07:01.320 --> 07:03.400
so that way they can participate in the booths.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.040
A little Bitcoin booth.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.560
Yeah, so that'll be at jblive.tv on March 31.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.560
I got to get that on the calendar.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.640
Got to get that on the calendar.

07:10.640 --> 07:11.280
After the show.

07:11.280 --> 07:12.120
Yeah, right.

07:12.120 --> 07:15.440
Yeah, I'll write down calendar.

07:15.440 --> 07:18.000
Brent, will you write it down too so then you remember?

07:18.000 --> 07:19.200
That way we can actually get it.

07:19.200 --> 07:19.560
Oh, yeah.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.440
I've already been doing that.

07:20.440 --> 07:20.960
Yeah.

07:20.960 --> 07:21.800
All right, thank you.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.880
I like that you're just sort of using Brent as your memory

07:23.880 --> 07:24.400
bank now.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.000
That's great.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.160
Because I don't know if he writes it down,

07:26.160 --> 07:27.600
he'll remember, you know?

07:27.600 --> 07:29.880
Chris and I actually call it his memory palace,

07:29.880 --> 07:30.720
thank you very much.

07:30.720 --> 07:31.220
Yeah.

07:31.220 --> 07:31.720
Yeah.

07:31.720 --> 07:32.220
Yeah.

07:32.220 --> 07:34.320
Yeah.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.360
OK, Wes, how are we doing over there?

07:37.360 --> 07:38.440
Anything?

07:38.440 --> 07:40.120
Stub OS installation complete.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.520
We set up a pre-boot volume.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.640
We set up a recovery volume.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.320
We've collected some firmware now.

07:46.320 --> 07:47.400
Is this all happening?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.720
We're installing the OS.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.360
Is this all happening in Mac OS?

07:50.360 --> 07:50.880
Yeah.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.000
Let me see the screen there.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.560
Let me tilt it over here so I can.

07:54.560 --> 07:57.720
So this is actually, what's kind of noteworthy about this

07:57.720 --> 07:59.320
is this installer script that they've

07:59.320 --> 08:02.520
built that you're running is running in a terminal window

08:02.520 --> 08:04.880
right along your web browser inside Mac OS.

08:04.880 --> 08:05.880
Yeah.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.160
That is really cool.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.480
It's actually running in the fish shell

08:08.480 --> 08:10.760
that I installed under Nix, but that's a separate story.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.000
We'll get to that, Wes.

08:12.000 --> 08:12.600
All right.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.840
I am feeling pretty good about this.

08:13.840 --> 08:14.920
We will check back in.

08:14.920 --> 08:23.340
So this week, we want to announce a Nix challenge

08:23.340 --> 08:26.160
that we're going to run for the month of April.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.800
Now, this is not a big deal.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.320
It's going to be a low-key thing.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.960
We may end up being, I would imagine,

08:33.960 --> 08:36.680
a topic of conversation at the meetup.

08:36.680 --> 08:38.680
But here's what we're thinking is

08:38.680 --> 08:40.960
you could join at any point in the month of April.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.760
We're going to have this challenge running

08:42.760 --> 08:43.920
for the whole month.

08:43.920 --> 08:45.620
And I hope that the goals are totally

08:45.620 --> 08:48.680
achievable for anybody that's got a few hours over that month

08:48.680 --> 08:50.640
period they can invest into this.

08:50.640 --> 08:54.680
So one of the top goals, this is particularly personal for me,

08:54.680 --> 08:57.480
is I need to study the Nix expression language

08:57.480 --> 08:59.020
so I understand what I'm getting into.

08:59.020 --> 09:01.520
And we're going to explain more of this, so don't worry.

09:01.520 --> 09:03.920
We're going to set some of this up for you.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.840
You've got to set up at least one Nix system.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.360
It doesn't have to be anything super complicated.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.600
You have to be able to install HTOP.

09:10.600 --> 09:14.240
And you need to join the Nix Nerds Matrix

09:14.240 --> 09:16.520
room that I set up on the Jupyter Broadcasting Matrix

09:16.520 --> 09:17.200
server.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.720
Just as a side note here, our Matrix community

09:20.720 --> 09:23.440
is really incredible right now.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.640
It's at that perfect size where there's enough people in there

09:26.640 --> 09:28.360
that we get good, robust conversation,

09:28.360 --> 09:30.240
but everybody's really respectful.

09:30.240 --> 09:33.000
And everybody is sort of helpful to newcomers.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.160
And we just set up this Nix Nerds room.

09:36.160 --> 09:40.520
And I set it up Friday night before I left the studio.

09:40.520 --> 09:41.880
And I just created it.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.400
And I told one person.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.560
I said, hey, I'm going to make this room.

09:45.560 --> 09:46.920
I think maybe this is where we'll

09:46.920 --> 09:49.120
talk about Nix as we start talking about on the shows

09:49.120 --> 09:50.400
more.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.480
I opened up Elements Saturday morning.

09:53.480 --> 09:55.600
And there was already nearly a dozen people

09:55.600 --> 09:57.400
in there nerding out about Nix.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.640
That's how passionate people are.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.920
It just exploded on its own.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.080
Yeah, you were kind enough to invite me to the room.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.640
And I was like, how long has it been?

10:04.640 --> 10:06.120
Have I just missed that this was around?

10:06.120 --> 10:07.600
No, no, it was just created.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.720
It just got started.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.600
And I will put a link in the show notes

10:10.600 --> 10:13.520
because people in there have been so helpful answering

10:13.520 --> 10:15.080
some of my newbie questions.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.520
And it really helped me kind of wrap my head around a few

10:17.520 --> 10:20.000
concepts that I was struggling with.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.400
And they're not pushy.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.080
They're not pushy.

10:23.080 --> 10:27.120
So here's the goals.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.480
Learn a little bit about the Nix language.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.040
Set up at least one system.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.280
Install HTOP.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.560
Join the Nix nerds matrix room.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.480
And then post a screenshot in that channel of your Nix system.

10:38.480 --> 10:39.920
And if you want meaningless points

10:39.920 --> 10:41.680
that won't count towards anything,

10:41.680 --> 10:45.920
post a screenshot of like a full Plasma or Gnome or i3

10:45.920 --> 10:48.400
or whatever floats your boat desktop.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.680
I would also say maybe try setting up a server.

10:51.680 --> 10:55.200
Spin up a Linoad or something and do something

10:55.200 --> 10:59.200
you would have tried in Docker or on your CentOS

10:59.200 --> 11:01.440
or a BungieBox and see if you can get that running with Nix.

11:01.440 --> 11:01.960
Yeah.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.440
It was so much fun.

11:03.440 --> 11:08.280
And each one of us had a little kind of journey of, OK,

11:08.280 --> 11:09.240
I'll give this a go.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.680
We'll take a look at this.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.560
And then as we started looking into it,

11:12.560 --> 11:14.720
we really kind of just started getting super excited.

11:14.720 --> 11:17.240
So I kind of want to cover why we're interested in it

11:17.240 --> 11:21.000
and why we're suggesting that we all do an Arch style Nix

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
challenge from the old days, like bringing that forward now

11:24.000 --> 11:24.480
to Nix.

11:24.480 --> 11:29.280
Because in a lot of ways, Nix feels like an OS

11:29.280 --> 11:34.000
that I may make my future primary distro for a lot

11:34.000 --> 11:34.480
of stuff.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.240
Like I feel like a big shift is happening here.

11:37.240 --> 11:40.160
And I thought I'd kind of get into why a little bit.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.800
So I think it's a fun challenge.

11:41.800 --> 11:42.880
Join us for that.

11:42.880 --> 11:46.360
And here's the sort of overview of what

11:46.360 --> 11:48.680
we are loving about Nix.

11:48.680 --> 11:52.560
In real simple terms, this solves a couple of big problems

11:52.560 --> 11:53.520
that I have.

11:53.520 --> 11:57.440
And one of those is we have a fair amount of infrastructure

11:57.440 --> 11:58.960
that we need to build out, but we

11:58.960 --> 12:01.600
have a very limited amount of time

12:01.600 --> 12:04.560
to actually apply to that effort.

12:04.560 --> 12:07.080
And then additionally, we'll deploy stuff,

12:07.080 --> 12:09.600
and it will remain in production for a year to even,

12:09.600 --> 12:12.480
I mean, in the cases of like J-Bot, a decade.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.400
I don't know, 12 years.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.400
I don't know how long J-Bot's still running, kind of.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.960
And you come back to these projects literally

12:19.960 --> 12:23.240
sometimes five, six, seven years later,

12:23.240 --> 12:25.880
and there isn't appropriate documentation.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.000
It's really not clear what we were attempting to do here.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.800
Don't really understand why it's set up this way.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.800
And I just got to use that.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.320
I got to accept that technical debt,

12:35.320 --> 12:36.800
because I don't have time to solve that,

12:36.800 --> 12:37.920
and I got to move forward.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.560
And then you end up building up a bunch

12:39.560 --> 12:41.520
of technical debt over time.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.560
So Nix, and Nix is a package manager,

12:43.560 --> 12:46.160
and Nix OS is a base, real bare Linux system

12:46.160 --> 12:48.520
that's built using the Nix package system.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.960
It solves that problem, because it documents everything

12:51.960 --> 12:53.600
via its configuration file.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.440
Everything that you put in there, you can read it,

12:55.440 --> 12:57.520
and you understand how the system is set up,

12:57.520 --> 12:59.480
and then it will build that exact system.

12:59.480 --> 13:03.360
So if a system goes out, you reload from that config file,

13:03.360 --> 13:06.320
and it reproduces the exact system as you had it.

13:06.320 --> 13:09.360
And that is really compelling when you think about,

13:09.360 --> 13:12.400
we could create a J-B base Nix config

13:12.400 --> 13:15.400
that had a certain set of users, SSH configuration,

13:15.400 --> 13:17.840
base packages that we use,

13:17.840 --> 13:20.240
maybe tail scales installed by default,

13:20.240 --> 13:22.560
all these kinds of base setups that we could then deploy

13:22.560 --> 13:25.080
on our cloud servers and our local infrastructure,

13:25.960 --> 13:28.000
and it would always be a very common setup.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.840
And you can accomplish a lot of this

13:29.840 --> 13:33.360
through things like Puppet or Chef or Ansible.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.920
There's a lot of Kubernetes, really.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.440
There's a lot of ways to solve this problem,

13:37.440 --> 13:40.120
but Nix is solving it at the system level, right?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.960
It's solving it deep at the base config,

13:42.960 --> 13:44.960
and when you use it with Nix OS,

13:44.960 --> 13:48.280
you can actually build the whole system with this.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.720
But you can also install the Nix Package Manager

13:50.720 --> 13:53.480
on a lot of distributions, and even Mac OS,

13:53.480 --> 13:56.080
and I think maybe Windows, don't know.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.640
But I tried it on CentOS Stream 9, and it was great.

13:58.640 --> 13:59.560
Oh, nice.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.840
It was a real nice combo.

14:02.400 --> 14:06.000
Okay, so I've kind of given why I find it super compelling.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.840
I wonder, Wes, if you could give kind of a overview

14:08.840 --> 14:10.240
of what maybe I've missed

14:10.240 --> 14:12.000
or what you find compelling about Nix.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.240
There's a lot to go into here,

14:13.240 --> 14:15.840
so I'm sure we'll figure out the best ways

14:15.840 --> 14:17.160
to talk about it as we go on.

14:17.160 --> 14:22.160
But there's Nix, the sort of lazy functional language

14:22.400 --> 14:25.960
that you use to describe the system and packages.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.080
And then there's like Nix,

14:27.080 --> 14:28.360
there's a whole bunch of Nix tooling,

14:28.360 --> 14:30.720
and it's a build system that lets you

14:30.720 --> 14:35.040
declaratively build packages in a reproducible fashion

14:35.040 --> 14:38.000
in a way that really understands the graph structure

14:38.000 --> 14:39.880
of how dependencies all relate to each other

14:39.880 --> 14:42.480
in a more sophisticated way than we're kind of used to

14:42.480 --> 14:44.520
from some of the traditional Linux packaging.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.560
Yeah, my understanding too, like in there,

14:46.560 --> 14:47.760
is when it's building software,

14:47.760 --> 14:49.360
it'll actually build it in a sandbox

14:49.360 --> 14:52.520
and really has a genuine map of all of the dependencies,

14:52.520 --> 14:55.240
and that is in part what makes it reproducible.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.440
And say, maybe this is a crazy example

14:57.440 --> 14:59.360
that nobody would ever do,

14:59.360 --> 15:01.360
but say you're a guy or a gal

15:01.360 --> 15:03.000
that likes to run the Plasma desktop,

15:03.000 --> 15:05.400
and you love Plasma, you're all in on Plasma, but then-

15:05.400 --> 15:06.440
I know a few of those.

15:06.440 --> 15:07.880
But, and you're talking about it all the time,

15:07.880 --> 15:08.840
you're talking about how great it is,

15:08.840 --> 15:11.240
and then like the new GNOME 42 comes out

15:11.240 --> 15:16.240
and you're like, that looks great, I'd love to try that,

15:16.240 --> 15:17.280
but I don't want to have

15:17.280 --> 15:19.160
both Plasma and GNOME installed at the same time,

15:19.160 --> 15:21.640
I don't want to have multiple terminal emulators

15:21.640 --> 15:23.680
and file managers and libraries.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.520
What a mess, right?

15:24.520 --> 15:25.360
I don't want that.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.160
Yeah, and I mean, in theory, you know,

15:27.160 --> 15:28.640
you can strip those things.

15:28.640 --> 15:29.480
Oh, sure.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.600
But you kind of got to figure out all the things

15:30.600 --> 15:33.240
that it actually installed, and I never do.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.080
I just always-

15:34.080 --> 15:35.040
It hangs around, yeah.

15:35.040 --> 15:35.880
I just always install the other desktop.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.520
And then whenever you're doing your auto-complete,

15:37.520 --> 15:40.240
you get the wrong terminal, it doesn't match the desktop.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.280
Or like when you're browsing through the menu,

15:42.280 --> 15:45.720
it's like, I've got so many entries in there now.

15:45.720 --> 15:49.000
So in a NIC system, you would go into the configuration

15:49.000 --> 15:51.560
and you'd probably have like a sub-configuration file

15:51.560 --> 15:53.440
just for your graphical environment.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.200
And you could essentially, in there,

15:55.200 --> 15:58.560
change it from a Plasma system to a GNOME system,

15:58.560 --> 16:00.680
and then rebuild that box.

16:00.680 --> 16:03.720
And it would build clean as if it had always been

16:03.720 --> 16:06.800
a GNOME system from the very, very beginning,

16:06.800 --> 16:10.200
as if you installed it straight off the ISO like that.

16:10.200 --> 16:13.560
And what's great is it will test all of that,

16:13.560 --> 16:15.440
it will make sure all of it builds correctly

16:15.440 --> 16:18.320
and works before you actually have to accept the changes

16:18.320 --> 16:20.880
and activate it, which is really powerful too.

16:20.880 --> 16:21.720
All right, so I'm sorry,

16:21.720 --> 16:23.240
I just wanted to make that example, Wes,

16:23.240 --> 16:24.840
but I'm sure there's,

16:24.840 --> 16:26.840
I probably interrupted you right in mid-thought.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.800
Well, yeah, it's just that there's like a lot to NIC.

16:28.800 --> 16:31.840
So you've got this, you've got a language to describe

16:31.840 --> 16:34.400
how to build things, and in the case of NIC's OS,

16:34.400 --> 16:35.880
construct a system.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.280
And then you've got tooling to make that happen.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.520
And then the way it all works with the NIC store,

16:40.520 --> 16:42.920
and there's a lot of details that we probably won't get into

16:42.920 --> 16:45.120
for this episode, but it means that you can have

16:45.120 --> 16:47.400
all these packages safely co-installed

16:47.400 --> 16:49.400
with different versions in a way

16:49.400 --> 16:53.400
that you can go back and roll back at any time.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.960
It also means that you can bring those packages with you.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.440
A lot of the NIC's tooling is set up

16:57.440 --> 17:00.120
so you can just install the NIC's package manager.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.000
If you're on your Mac desktop or it's on a Linux server,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.240
you can do both of those and that'll work just fine.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.560
And then, so there's those things, there's the tooling,

17:07.560 --> 17:10.520
and then there's NIC's packages, which is a repository.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.560
Well, actually, it's really,

17:11.560 --> 17:14.360
you can kind of think of it as a giant NIC's expression

17:14.360 --> 17:17.960
in the NIC's language, but it's a big whole set

17:17.960 --> 17:20.040
of NIC's expressions that describe how to build

17:20.040 --> 17:22.560
a whole bunch of packages that you probably want already.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.120
Yeah, and that could be all kinds of things

17:24.120 --> 17:26.880
from VS Code to Plex, Home Assistant, NGINX.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.960
HTOP, normal Linux stuff.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.680
And then you can just use that to assemble.

17:32.680 --> 17:33.840
It can build it from source

17:33.840 --> 17:36.160
because it has a powerful build tooling built in,

17:36.160 --> 17:37.240
but then there's also a whole bunch

17:37.240 --> 17:39.760
of caching infrastructure that the project maintains,

17:39.760 --> 17:40.740
which is awesome.

17:40.740 --> 17:43.680
So it means if you're on a commonly supported architecture

17:43.680 --> 17:46.360
like x86 Linux, then yeah, you're just gonna,

17:46.360 --> 17:48.580
you're gonna pull down the binary stuff by default.

17:48.580 --> 17:51.360
So it's all surprisingly fast,

17:51.360 --> 17:54.020
which is one aspect of this I didn't really think about.

17:54.020 --> 17:55.920
I talked a little bit in self-hosted this week.

17:55.920 --> 17:57.680
I think it was episode 67.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.800
I've had a lot of success

18:00.800 --> 18:03.240
and we have a lot of applications deployed in productions

18:03.240 --> 18:07.160
that are in containers, Docker and Podman at this point.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.700
But when I look at building a system with NICs,

18:09.700 --> 18:13.360
I actually see a future where maybe I'm not using containers

18:13.360 --> 18:14.960
as much as I thought I was,

18:14.960 --> 18:16.800
and that I'm actually using NICs

18:16.800 --> 18:19.000
to manage most of my software,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
which I think I'll get into in the future,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.420
maybe next week when we actually kick the challenge off.

18:23.420 --> 18:25.120
There's kind of that element of,

18:25.120 --> 18:28.720
because it's also nicely separated out in the NIC store

18:28.720 --> 18:30.840
and isolated from each other.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.400
There is, you know, that initial excitement

18:33.400 --> 18:35.280
when you first got into Linux and you were like,

18:35.280 --> 18:38.200
oh, the package manager, there's all this software.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.920
I can just install, but before you learned

18:39.920 --> 18:42.320
about how like a box that had six dozen things on it,

18:42.320 --> 18:45.400
so that sat for a year, wasn't a great pattern.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.240
Some of that excitement has come back with NICs

18:47.240 --> 18:48.560
where you're just like, oh, but I can do it

18:48.560 --> 18:50.800
in a more maintainable, declarative way,

18:50.800 --> 18:52.400
right out of the box.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.480
I wanna let ETU get in here too,

18:55.480 --> 18:57.000
because I know that you were a contributor

18:57.000 --> 18:58.820
for many years to NICs.

18:58.820 --> 19:01.420
And so maybe you could give us a little more nuance

19:01.420 --> 19:03.360
on how the package manager is working.

19:03.360 --> 19:06.840
It's source, but there's that binary cache, right?

19:06.840 --> 19:08.960
Yeah, so the thing that NICs does

19:08.960 --> 19:13.960
is that it has the NICs package tree definitions

19:14.680 --> 19:16.400
on your local system.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.480
And then it evaluates which packages it needs

19:19.480 --> 19:24.480
and each package will have the set of instructions

19:25.720 --> 19:30.400
for building a package is based upon all dependencies

19:30.400 --> 19:34.880
and the build instructions for that package.

19:34.880 --> 19:39.080
And then we just hash it down to a hash

19:39.080 --> 19:41.600
and then you can ask the binary cache,

19:41.600 --> 19:43.520
do you have this hash?

19:43.520 --> 19:47.200
And then the binary cache can either send,

19:47.200 --> 19:51.180
no, I don't have that hash, or send back a binary.

19:51.180 --> 19:56.180
And then you get that exact software hash back.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.560
I see, and so if it says no, then it just builds it?

19:59.560 --> 20:00.400
Yes.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.360
Aha, that hashing technique is really cool.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.840
Yeah, this also makes it very easy

20:05.840 --> 20:08.040
to patch software locally.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.480
So you can, in your configuration,

20:10.480 --> 20:12.600
just say, I want Mumble,

20:12.600 --> 20:15.560
but with this patch applied to Mumble.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.860
And then it will build Mumble every time you update

20:18.860 --> 20:21.380
because some dependency changed.

20:21.380 --> 20:24.480
But at the same time, if you don't want a patch,

20:24.480 --> 20:27.840
then yeah, then you just get it from the binary cache.

20:27.840 --> 20:30.720
So you have kind of the power of Gen2,

20:30.720 --> 20:34.200
but you can choose to,

20:34.200 --> 20:37.300
when to build or not to build, pretty much.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.400
Yeah.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.560
Brent, this is a pretty different approach

20:40.560 --> 20:42.240
to how a distribution is built.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.400
It's a different way of thinking

20:43.400 --> 20:44.900
about even managing a system.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.200
They call it a declarative configuration.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.160
And I'm curious to know what your take is

20:50.160 --> 20:51.520
coming at something that's probably

20:51.520 --> 20:53.360
a pretty new way of looking at Linux.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.960
Yeah, when you first suggested

20:54.960 --> 20:56.120
that we really dive into this,

20:56.120 --> 20:58.800
which we've been thinking about for months.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.900
We've gotten mail from various listeners.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.040
And for months now,

21:02.040 --> 21:05.060
I've been slowly gathering articles

21:05.060 --> 21:08.000
that describe why we shouldn't do this.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.840
So I was super skeptical to dive in,

21:09.840 --> 21:13.740
especially that this felt kind of, hmm,

21:13.740 --> 21:16.240
like a perfect West way to build a system

21:16.240 --> 21:18.880
and maybe not a perfect Brent way to build a system.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.260
Hey, ouch.

21:20.260 --> 21:21.100
I feel judged over here.

21:21.100 --> 21:21.920
No, no, no, no.

21:21.920 --> 21:22.760
I think it's a compliment actually.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.160
That's a compliment for sure.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.240
More of like a developer's approach.

21:26.240 --> 21:30.000
I've looked at a few accounting softwares

21:30.000 --> 21:30.960
and some of them are user-friendly

21:30.960 --> 21:33.360
and some of them are really developer focused

21:33.360 --> 21:34.320
and they seem really interesting.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.320
And then I start getting into them.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.480
I'm like, I don't have the skills for this.

21:37.480 --> 21:40.360
And so Nix felt like that for me at first.

21:40.360 --> 21:44.920
So I probably spent 80% of the time

21:44.920 --> 21:45.920
we spent doing research,

21:45.920 --> 21:50.480
just trying to understand what this all was

21:50.480 --> 21:52.780
and if I could even get into it.

21:52.780 --> 21:57.160
And it turns out that it takes a bunch of concepts

21:57.160 --> 22:02.020
that we're used to in sort of what I'll call legacy Linux

22:02.020 --> 22:05.800
ways of doing things and sort of flips them

22:05.800 --> 22:07.920
and gives them a whole bunch of features

22:07.920 --> 22:12.920
that I have secretly been trying to learn for a few years.

22:14.160 --> 22:17.520
Places where I think Ansible seems interesting

22:17.520 --> 22:19.600
and I know we'll talk more about that,

22:19.600 --> 22:24.480
but Nix feels like, at least Nix OS feels like a way of,

22:24.480 --> 22:26.680
accomplishing a lot of things all at once

22:26.680 --> 22:28.540
and once you wrap your head around it,

22:29.860 --> 22:32.640
is super user-friendly in a strange kind of way.

22:32.640 --> 22:37.320
So that's what excites me is that the learning curve,

22:37.320 --> 22:39.700
I think for the concepts was like,

22:39.700 --> 22:42.200
oh, this is just a total paradigm shift,

22:42.200 --> 22:45.640
which I think are important to explore

22:45.640 --> 22:48.560
and are worth the time of trying to wrap your head around.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.040
But then the actual implementation,

22:50.040 --> 22:53.520
I found actually surprisingly easy, which is great.

22:53.520 --> 22:57.920
Lino.com slash unplugged,

22:57.920 --> 23:01.240
go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.260
And you go there to support this here show.

23:03.260 --> 23:05.760
That is fast, reliable cloud hosting right there.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.400
Go try it for yourself for a project.

23:07.400 --> 23:09.880
Woo-wee, boy, I just, I slipped right into that.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.640
I apologize, I just get excited about Lino.

23:12.640 --> 23:14.560
You know, and then I get into like a cowboy mode.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.880
Yeah, it's natural.

23:15.880 --> 23:19.200
Did you know I got a CentOS box going on Linode

23:19.200 --> 23:21.600
that has Nix installed on it?

23:21.600 --> 23:22.440
Nice.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.600
And they actually have a guide

23:23.600 --> 23:26.360
if you want to do Nix OS on Linode.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.600
It's a great example of why I love Linode.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.560
They just let you go all the way if you want.

23:30.560 --> 23:34.240
You know, also, I happen to notice that the Linode CLI,

23:34.240 --> 23:37.240
that's packaged in Nix, so even better.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.160
That is, that is so great.

23:39.160 --> 23:42.080
I love that command line tool and they have a great API

23:42.080 --> 23:44.760
and they have fantastic documentation.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.240
You bring all that together, that means

23:46.240 --> 23:48.440
if you get a wild hair or if you have something

23:48.440 --> 23:51.160
you need to build, you're gonna have the support

23:51.160 --> 23:53.520
in both documentation and actual customer support

23:53.520 --> 23:54.440
to pull it off.

23:54.440 --> 23:58.320
They have great 24-7, 365 customer support.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.660
They don't do that escalation thing or none of that.

24:00.660 --> 24:02.600
You just get your problem solved.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.960
And they've been doing this for 19 years

24:03.960 --> 24:05.800
and they've learned they need to constantly invest

24:05.800 --> 24:07.560
in their infrastructure and their tooling.

24:07.560 --> 24:08.400
And so they're doing it.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.060
They just are relentless about that.

24:11.060 --> 24:14.220
Rolling out new hardware and new features all the time.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.320
They always give me something new to talk about

24:16.320 --> 24:17.300
all the time.

24:17.300 --> 24:18.840
You know, like right now they're rolling out

24:18.840 --> 24:22.720
a beta of a database as a service and it's so slick.

24:22.720 --> 24:24.880
It's all the great stuff about Linode,

24:24.880 --> 24:27.280
but brought to like managing a database for you.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.920
And they've just got done upgrading their fast rigs

24:29.920 --> 24:33.760
to MVME PCIe storage, so that's always screaming.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.760
And they took the time, they spent the effort.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.040
They did the hard work to make their network connections

24:39.040 --> 24:41.360
as fast as possible and they became their own ISP.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.620
I mean, I could go on and on and on.

24:43.620 --> 24:45.400
So just go try it yourself.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.760
Go give them the unplugged boost to go say hello

24:47.760 --> 24:50.600
and thanks for supporting by going to linode.com

24:50.600 --> 24:52.000
slash unplugged.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.960
Get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account

24:54.960 --> 24:56.220
and you support the show.

24:56.220 --> 24:59.040
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.680
All right, Wes Payne, let's check in over there

25:04.680 --> 25:06.400
on the M1 Linux install.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.240
How are we doing?

25:07.240 --> 25:09.560
Oh, we're doing well so far.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.240
I've proceeded through a prompt

25:11.240 --> 25:15.520
where I was quite carefully warned to read carefully

25:15.520 --> 25:18.040
lest I leave the system in an unbootable state.

25:18.040 --> 25:19.520
So you just skip right past that.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.640
Yep, skip right past that.

25:20.640 --> 25:23.400
I've now shut the system down as instructed.

25:23.400 --> 25:27.000
And I think we're getting ready to reboot into Asahi.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.160
Yeah, things have been extracted and installed.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.840
So it's off right now and you're gonna power it up.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.440
Yeah, we had to wait 15 seconds

25:34.440 --> 25:36.480
for the system to fully shut down.

25:36.480 --> 25:39.060
It's important that the system be fully powered off

25:39.060 --> 25:39.920
before this step.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.600
So does that imply that when you turn a Mac off,

25:41.600 --> 25:43.360
it's actually still on for 15 seconds?

25:43.360 --> 25:44.560
Kind of does, yeah, doesn't it?

25:44.560 --> 25:46.840
Huh, that's an interesting little discovery.

25:46.840 --> 25:47.680
All right, well, let's turn it on.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.280
Let's see here.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.280
Do you have to hold down a button?

25:51.280 --> 25:54.840
I do, yeah, press and hold the power button.

25:54.840 --> 25:56.880
All right, then you'll get a boot menu.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.960
Loading startup options.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.120
Okay.

26:03.120 --> 26:06.760
Once I see a spinner or it says entering startup options,

26:06.760 --> 26:11.760
I'm supposed to release, okay.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.880
Got some options, spinning.

26:14.880 --> 26:15.840
You do, you got a spinner?

26:15.840 --> 26:17.240
Yeah, here you go, take a look.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.440
Oh, and hey.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.000
Look at that, there's an Asahi Linux boot entry.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.640
They even have their logo on there.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.160
That looks good.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.560
Click that, Wes, click it.

26:26.560 --> 26:27.680
Let's see what we get.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.800
All right, booting up.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.920
But why is it the Mac OS booting?

26:36.920 --> 26:40.760
It said that you might see a recovery screen for a second.

26:40.760 --> 26:43.480
You will briefly see a Mac OS recovery dialogue.

26:43.480 --> 26:44.320
Okay.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.960
Sometimes you might be asked to select a volume to recover.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.000
Choose your normal Mac OS volume.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.680
Oh, yep, okay, I bet I can do this.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.760
I made Wes's user avatar poo.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.080
So he's the poo emoji.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.520
It's appropriate.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.480
I'm an adult, I'm an adult.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.680
All right, should we check back in

27:05.680 --> 27:07.440
or do you think it's gonna go quick?

27:09.120 --> 27:12.040
We'll see, I'm just about to, the installer popped up here.

27:12.040 --> 27:14.040
So we're running some recovery installer scripts.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.720
So like we gotta fix something on the main Mac install?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.440
No, I think it's just using this environment

27:19.440 --> 27:20.840
to help bootstrap itself.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.400
Oh, interesting.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.760
So if you were gonna do Nix or Fedora,

27:25.760 --> 27:27.480
you'd still have to go through this part, wouldn't you?

27:27.480 --> 27:29.400
Yeah, they do have an option when you're installing it.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.560
Like you could do the desktop Asahi Linux install

27:32.560 --> 27:37.440
or a minimal sort of install, which is Arch Linux arm.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.400
But then they also had one that just sort of bootstrap

27:39.400 --> 27:41.480
the Linux environment and UEFI.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.600
And I think from there you can install other stuff.

27:44.600 --> 27:47.720
I think that's the base that the OpenBSD early support

27:47.720 --> 27:48.920
goes off of as well.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.320
Local policy update is in progress.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.320
Oh, we're getting updates.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.240
It's asking if I'm sure we wanna do something.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.320
I don't really know what it says.

27:59.320 --> 28:00.160
I'm gonna hit yes.

28:00.160 --> 28:01.480
Go for it.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.520
YOLO, Wes.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.320
YOLO, mom, you only MacBook once.

28:06.320 --> 28:07.880
But no, that's not quite right.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.200
Yeah, this wasn't an expensive machine at all.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.000
So it doesn't matter if we break it.

28:16.240 --> 28:18.000
I feel like we'll have to come back.

28:18.000 --> 28:18.840
Yeah.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.040
Cause you know, I've kinda, I wanna,

28:20.040 --> 28:21.800
I got more Nix stuff to talk about.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.280
All right, come back to me.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.880
All right, you give me a, give me a, boy.

28:24.880 --> 28:25.800
Installation complete.

28:25.800 --> 28:26.640
Press enter to reboot.

28:26.640 --> 28:27.480
Okay, okay, hold on now.

28:27.480 --> 28:29.280
We can't go, we can't go.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.680
We gotta finish this up now.

28:31.720 --> 28:32.840
Oh, boy.

28:37.320 --> 28:38.400
Let's see, Wes.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.760
All right, don't you have to hold down the power button

28:39.760 --> 28:40.880
or else it's gonna go into macOS?

28:40.880 --> 28:41.720
I don't know.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.920
It just said press enter to reboot.

28:42.920 --> 28:43.760
I think you gotta.

28:43.760 --> 28:44.600
Oh, no.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.440
Oh.

28:45.440 --> 28:46.680
Asahi is the default.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.880
Asahi logo, U-boot logo.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.120
Oh, it's going, Wes.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.880
Oh, that's a good sign.

28:53.880 --> 28:54.720
Grub.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.120
We got grub.

28:56.120 --> 28:56.960
What are you doing?

28:56.960 --> 28:57.800
Press enter.

28:57.800 --> 28:58.640
Come on, let's go.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.440
What's it doing?

29:01.440 --> 29:02.400
What's it doing?

29:02.400 --> 29:03.600
Holy shit.

29:03.600 --> 29:04.960
That was fast.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.280
Whoa.

29:08.960 --> 29:09.800
Whoa, Wes.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.360
That's a win right there though.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.440
Holy crap.

29:13.440 --> 29:15.840
Yeah, we got a plasma setup going on.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.160
Holy crap.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.280
So, so well, here's what happened in studio

29:25.280 --> 29:27.880
is I was like, come on, Wes, hit enter on the grub

29:27.880 --> 29:29.960
and Wes hit enter and then the next thing

29:29.960 --> 29:32.320
that flashed on the screen was the plasma desktop.

29:32.320 --> 29:34.120
It was that fast.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.040
It was remarkable.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.000
That was really great.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.200
So that's fun.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.080
So now we have a plasma desktop going on the M1 Max.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.760
We're gonna give that a go.

29:42.760 --> 29:44.520
Ha ha, look at that, Wes.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.080
Nicely done.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.240
Now, gentlemen, I know we've been playing with this

29:48.240 --> 29:51.360
for a few days now, but I want you to go into details.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.360
Chris, what did you do that got you so excited?

29:54.360 --> 29:55.560
You know, we all took different routes.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.760
Tell me about yours.

29:56.760 --> 29:59.040
Mine started when I was thinking about my home setup.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.640
I talked about this recently on the show.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.960
I'm thinking about redoing everything.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.040
And I was thinking about these problems I want to solve

30:05.040 --> 30:08.000
about trying to understand how I put a system together

30:08.000 --> 30:10.240
after I look at it a year later,

30:10.240 --> 30:12.600
trying to make it really simple to recover during an outage

30:12.600 --> 30:14.480
because I don't necessarily just have a few days

30:14.480 --> 30:16.200
set aside to fix something

30:16.200 --> 30:18.320
and trying to solve for these problems.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.800
Essentially, it all started for me when Home Assistant

30:20.800 --> 30:22.880
decided they needed to upgrade their Python version

30:22.880 --> 30:25.440
where dropping support for my Z-Wave integration

30:25.440 --> 30:28.840
and I realized I had to redo my whole setup.

30:28.840 --> 30:31.520
Python version upgrades.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.800
It's such a reasonable thing.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.800
I totally understand it from a project standpoint,

30:34.800 --> 30:38.280
but it causes me such a huge amount of work

30:38.280 --> 30:40.120
that I just decided, well, I'm going to use this

30:40.120 --> 30:44.400
as an opportunity to just rebuild my entire home network.

30:44.400 --> 30:45.680
And now my thinking is,

30:45.680 --> 30:48.080
depending on the status of Asahi Linux,

30:48.080 --> 30:51.520
I think instead of using a couple of Raspberry Pis

30:51.520 --> 30:54.560
as my home servers, I'm considering doing Asahi Linux

30:54.560 --> 30:56.600
on an M1 Mac Mini.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.400
Oh, consolidating down from the Pis

30:58.400 --> 31:01.280
onto one beefy M1 system.

31:01.280 --> 31:02.640
Running Nix.

31:02.640 --> 31:03.480
Oh.

31:03.480 --> 31:04.440
Yeah, yeah.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.320
So that's the connection here.

31:06.320 --> 31:09.360
Yeah, and I think I would run a lot of this stuff

31:10.400 --> 31:13.440
natively in Nix and not in containers.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.360
I'm not totally sure about Home Assistant yet,

31:15.360 --> 31:16.320
but I have to test it.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.600
So my journey was just that, Brent.

31:18.600 --> 31:22.040
I started essentially building a parallel version

31:22.040 --> 31:26.320
of my home server in a Nix VM.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.640
Jup's network 2.0.

31:27.640 --> 31:29.560
Yeah, yeah, and just to see

31:29.560 --> 31:31.880
what are the pros and cons of doing this.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.880
And that's when I realized, oh, geez,

31:34.880 --> 31:37.880
this is a game changer in how I'm going to manage my systems.

31:37.880 --> 31:41.280
And I don't really see me using anything else

31:41.280 --> 31:44.520
because you really just have to figure out

31:44.520 --> 31:46.640
that Nix language and how to structure that.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.760
And then once you have that problem solved,

31:48.760 --> 31:51.720
you can just read the config as documentation,

31:51.720 --> 31:54.800
it self-documents, it's so simple to deploy.

31:54.800 --> 31:58.560
And I can run it on an M1, I can run it on an x86 box,

31:58.560 --> 32:01.200
I can run it on a Raspberry Pi, like it's flexible.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.320
And it's very simple.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.600
Sort of one of the things that appeals to me

32:05.600 --> 32:08.800
about an Arch system is that it's a bare system

32:08.800 --> 32:11.120
that I build up, as opposed to maybe

32:11.120 --> 32:14.840
a more traditional distro that you kind of pare down,

32:14.840 --> 32:16.720
perhaps secure with AppArm or SE Linux

32:16.720 --> 32:18.840
and you kind of pare it down.

32:18.840 --> 32:23.000
Much like Arch, Nix OS is very bare and you build up.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.200
And while initially that often comes

32:25.200 --> 32:28.560
with some additional setup overhead as you're getting going

32:28.560 --> 32:31.440
and more things that need to be tweaked initially,

32:31.440 --> 32:33.760
it has sort of been a universal truth

32:33.760 --> 32:37.880
that the simpler the system, the longer it is maintainable,

32:37.880 --> 32:39.240
the simpler it is to update,

32:39.240 --> 32:42.480
the less problems it tends to have, et cetera, et cetera.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.680
And so I find that to be really super compelling as well.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.480
And it solves all these problems.

32:47.480 --> 32:51.040
I was thinking like, do I go Proxmox and set up like a NUC

32:51.040 --> 32:53.600
and maybe I just do everything as VM.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.880
Like it just, all of that goes away, it all melts away

32:56.880 --> 32:59.440
when I look at the way Nick solves it for me.

32:59.440 --> 33:00.920
It too has some advice there.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.560
Maybe Home Assistant stays in Docker,

33:03.560 --> 33:05.120
but it's interesting that you have the option.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.400
Yeah, so it sounds like that's sort of not

33:07.400 --> 33:08.880
like a great experience.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.320
I saw somewhere on the website,

33:10.320 --> 33:13.520
I think it's like 70% supported or something like that.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.200
At least they give you a number.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.040
Yeah.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.040
But Wes, I wondered,

33:17.040 --> 33:19.600
I think you were playing with a few containers and such.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.880
So I wondered if you had some insights in this

33:21.880 --> 33:24.960
or at least tell me what avenue you went down.

33:24.960 --> 33:25.800
Yeah, well, okay.

33:25.800 --> 33:28.040
So to start, one thing that you pointed out

33:28.040 --> 33:31.600
in the excellent NixOS manual was I mentioned that

33:31.600 --> 33:34.200
because it's really easy to get Nix bootstrapped,

33:34.200 --> 33:36.480
Nix the package manager bootstrapped on systems,

33:36.480 --> 33:39.480
you can kind of install it in interesting ways.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.880
And from the Arch side of things,

33:41.880 --> 33:44.200
I've always loved that you can bootstrap Arch systems

33:44.200 --> 33:46.400
from existing Linux and you can do the same thing with Nix

33:46.400 --> 33:48.680
and it's so much simpler.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.600
I was really impressed by that.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.480
So I spun up a Alma Linux box

33:53.480 --> 33:56.680
and that was working fine, got it up to date.

33:56.680 --> 33:59.520
And you just install Nix like the normal way

33:59.520 --> 34:00.800
and you run a couple of commands.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.760
There's a command to generate the new NixOS system,

34:03.760 --> 34:06.000
Nix expression config,

34:06.000 --> 34:10.080
and then it can generate all the new boot stuff for you.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.560
And you move your old boot out of the way and you reboot

34:12.560 --> 34:14.360
and then it's smart enough to go figure out

34:14.360 --> 34:16.640
all the stuff under your old root.

34:16.640 --> 34:17.800
It'll just move out of the way,

34:17.800 --> 34:20.360
set up the new Nix environment for you, boot into it.

34:20.360 --> 34:24.720
And then you can preload it with SSH keys

34:24.720 --> 34:28.480
and even like a hash of what you want the password to be.

34:28.480 --> 34:32.000
So it was kind of just like run a couple of commands,

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
edit the config a little bit to configure the system

34:34.000 --> 34:36.320
I wanted it to be, reboot,

34:36.320 --> 34:39.000
and then I was able to just SSH with my SSH key

34:39.000 --> 34:41.480
like into the new system and it was an Xbox.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.760
That's so rad.

34:42.760 --> 34:44.440
Doesn't that feel kind of magical?

34:44.440 --> 34:45.640
And then you can actually roll back

34:45.640 --> 34:47.240
to the old system if you want,

34:47.240 --> 34:52.240
or you just rm, rf slash old root and it's gone.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.120
That is, that's fun.

34:55.120 --> 34:57.760
You've assimilated that machine, that's what you've done.

34:57.760 --> 35:00.560
Whenever you go into one of these alternative systems,

35:00.560 --> 35:03.120
I think some of the docs even say like random stuff

35:03.120 --> 35:04.600
like reboot, download, or binaries,

35:04.600 --> 35:06.160
like they're probably not going to work on Nix

35:06.160 --> 35:07.920
just because of how different like the Nix OS

35:07.920 --> 35:12.000
and the Nix store setup is from traditional Linux systems.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.360
So you have to wonder like, okay,

35:13.360 --> 35:16.000
why am I going to have all the apps that I need?

35:16.000 --> 35:17.760
What kind of escape hatches do I have?

35:17.760 --> 35:19.760
And so I wanted to explore a little bit like,

35:19.760 --> 35:21.000
well, what would it look like?

35:21.000 --> 35:21.960
We run a lot of our stuff

35:21.960 --> 35:23.960
in kind of simple container setups right now.

35:23.960 --> 35:26.440
What does that look like on Nix OS?

35:26.440 --> 35:30.960
So I got traffic installed, but just in Nix,

35:30.960 --> 35:33.960
Nix OS set up in the config, you just kind of say services,

35:33.960 --> 35:35.400
traffic enabled equals true,

35:35.400 --> 35:38.000
and you can set everything up with let's encrypt,

35:38.000 --> 35:42.360
just you specify the traffic config in your Nix right there,

35:42.360 --> 35:43.200
which was really neat.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.680
And then I tried a tool I'd seen mentioned

35:45.680 --> 35:48.560
in some of the community called Arian,

35:48.560 --> 35:51.800
which is sort of like a Nix wrapper

35:51.800 --> 35:54.040
on top of Docker compose.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.880
And so you can use the Nix language and you can specify,

35:56.880 --> 35:57.800
and then it's a separate tool.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.680
You can integrate it directly into Nix if you want,

35:59.680 --> 36:02.120
or it can kind of run on its own.

36:02.120 --> 36:05.040
And then that used the built-in Nix OS support

36:05.040 --> 36:09.480
for running containers, either with Podman or Docker,

36:09.480 --> 36:10.800
or I'm sure there's other run times too.

36:10.800 --> 36:11.720
Those are the two I played with.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.120
Right, right, right.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.320
Well, that does sound like a blast.

36:15.320 --> 36:16.760
I think it's one of those,

36:16.760 --> 36:20.520
I was talking to the matrix in the matrix Nix nerds room.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.560
It's like one of those things where I've been looking at it

36:22.560 --> 36:24.920
almost solely as a server platform.

36:24.920 --> 36:26.640
And people in there were like, oh, no, no, no,

36:26.640 --> 36:28.160
it also makes for a great desktop.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.480
And I just haven't made that connection yet,

36:30.480 --> 36:33.040
but I could kind of see it here in like a studio environment

36:33.040 --> 36:37.880
where we want really predictable, solid Linux workstations.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.520
I could kind of see it, Wes.

36:39.520 --> 36:42.000
So it depended on the way that this challenge goes

36:42.000 --> 36:43.400
in the month of April,

36:43.400 --> 36:46.120
we may end up deciding to actually use Nix OS

36:46.120 --> 36:48.040
on our studio recording systems, I think.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.160
I think that's gonna be the determining factor out there.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.000
What do you think?

36:51.000 --> 36:51.840
You down?

36:51.840 --> 36:53.920
Yeah, I'm down.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.160
Oh, it's exciting.

36:55.160 --> 36:58.480
It feels to me like much how we use scripts to set up

36:58.480 --> 37:00.200
sort of the environment on top of the OS

37:00.200 --> 37:01.360
on some of the studio machines.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.720
Now you're using sort of a script

37:03.720 --> 37:05.760
to just define the entire system.

37:05.760 --> 37:08.080
And so it's really just a progression

37:08.080 --> 37:10.520
of what we've already been doing in a really beautiful way.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.160
You know, when I started looking at this too,

37:12.160 --> 37:17.160
I was very much in the head space of Nix versus Ansible,

37:18.080 --> 37:21.160
because we were trying to solve multiple problems

37:21.160 --> 37:22.000
and we were starting to think,

37:22.000 --> 37:23.080
well, maybe the way to do all of this

37:23.080 --> 37:26.160
would just be to manage our infrastructure with Ansible.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.040
And then I started looking at Nix and I thought,

37:28.040 --> 37:29.920
oh, well, no, screw Ansible.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.240
We're gonna do everything with Nix

37:31.240 --> 37:33.200
and it's just Nix for everything.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.200
And as we've talked and as we've looked at it,

37:36.200 --> 37:38.320
I don't actually think the two are mutually exclusive.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.840
And so I kind of want to encourage people

37:39.840 --> 37:41.720
not to kind of get hung up on the whole,

37:41.720 --> 37:45.320
like there's a lot of ways to manage

37:45.320 --> 37:47.800
and define a system aspect of it.

37:47.800 --> 37:50.360
I mean, it's definitely a part of the discussion,

37:50.360 --> 37:53.400
but I think there's a lot of compelling good stuff

37:53.400 --> 37:54.640
in here to look at.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.840
And I would like us not to get too hung up

37:56.840 --> 37:58.640
on that particular aspect.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.200
Yeah, and just like that those two tools

38:01.200 --> 38:02.280
and all the tools in the space,

38:02.280 --> 38:03.360
like there's a lot of overlap

38:03.360 --> 38:05.480
and then there's parts that they address entirely different

38:05.480 --> 38:07.280
or don't necessarily compete on as well,

38:07.280 --> 38:09.520
so that they can all be useful.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.400
Yeah, it's gonna be an interesting future

38:11.400 --> 38:16.320
because I tried to do it on SUSE and I ran into problems.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.760
And I don't know what this means,

38:17.760 --> 38:20.200
because I know we promised to run OpenSUSE

38:20.200 --> 38:23.960
on our server, but if we kind of are redefining everything

38:23.960 --> 38:25.240
and we end up wanting to go with Nix,

38:25.240 --> 38:27.840
I don't wanna like rule it out,

38:27.840 --> 38:31.000
but that's an awkward thing we're gonna have to resolve.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.040
So that's, but we have until the end of the challenge,

38:33.040 --> 38:36.360
I feel like until, because it may very well be

38:36.360 --> 38:37.200
that we get to the end of the challenge

38:37.200 --> 38:39.800
and we decide not to, I don't know.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.000
We're just really at the very beginning of this.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.240
Yeah, okay, so we both went down kind of the server route,

38:45.240 --> 38:48.840
but Brent, you braved NixOS in the desktop, right?

38:48.840 --> 38:52.080
You say brave, but it seemed like the thing to do.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.760
Mostly because I felt like it solves one of the problems

38:56.760 --> 38:58.320
I've been trying to solve for years too.

38:58.320 --> 39:01.200
And so it seems to me like that's what defined

39:01.200 --> 39:03.680
each direction that we went into.

39:03.680 --> 39:07.120
But I decided, yeah, the desktop feels like

39:07.120 --> 39:08.920
mostly what I use on a daily basis.

39:08.920 --> 39:11.120
And it feels like over a few years,

39:11.120 --> 39:15.000
any OS I've tried always gets kind of crafty

39:15.000 --> 39:17.920
and things start to like fall apart

39:17.920 --> 39:21.000
at about the like two or three year mark.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.280
And I don't know, maybe it's just a feeling,

39:22.280 --> 39:24.480
but this seemed like, oh, maybe this is a way

39:24.480 --> 39:27.360
to not ever get that, which was very interesting to me.

39:27.360 --> 39:31.720
So I booted up the NixOS Plasma ISO,

39:31.720 --> 39:33.160
of course I went Plasma.

39:33.160 --> 39:36.840
And I thought, okay, well, one of our challenge objectives,

39:36.840 --> 39:38.800
you know, one of our goals that we're putting out there

39:38.800 --> 39:40.520
is to install the desktop.

39:40.520 --> 39:43.840
And I'm surprised neither of you went that direction,

39:43.840 --> 39:45.160
but I sure did.

39:45.160 --> 39:49.360
And it was fascinating because it forced me

39:49.360 --> 39:53.880
to change the way I see a desktop system.

39:53.880 --> 39:57.880
So for instance, installing was almost exactly

39:57.880 --> 39:59.360
how Wes described, you know,

39:59.360 --> 40:04.320
I used the seemingly wonderful NixOS Generate Config

40:04.320 --> 40:06.920
to just kind of grab the current system

40:06.920 --> 40:11.280
and make a configuration template out of that,

40:11.280 --> 40:12.640
which I thought was really magical

40:12.640 --> 40:15.400
and made it so easy to just dive in.

40:15.400 --> 40:16.680
So I enabled a few things in there,

40:16.680 --> 40:19.240
but upon rebooting, I learned a lot of things.

40:19.240 --> 40:22.960
So I rebooted into the installed system,

40:22.960 --> 40:25.080
which was fast and great.

40:25.080 --> 40:28.640
And then I realized that none of the changes

40:28.640 --> 40:31.320
that I was making, so for instance,

40:31.320 --> 40:34.640
dark themes and like, you know, bookmarks in Firefox,

40:34.640 --> 40:36.640
or even just history, like bash history,

40:36.640 --> 40:39.520
none of that was persisting across reboots.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.120
What you'd kind of like, right?

40:41.120 --> 40:42.680
Well, I thought that was essential

40:42.680 --> 40:45.800
for being a usable desktop environment.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.920
And then I just reminded myself

40:47.920 --> 40:51.520
that the system gets sort of erased

40:51.520 --> 40:54.320
and regenerated on every reboot,

40:54.320 --> 40:58.160
which is a new concept to throw your head around,

40:58.160 --> 40:59.320
and yet one of its strengths.

40:59.320 --> 41:02.400
So I had to actually add a home directory

41:02.400 --> 41:05.200
to my user in the config, which seemed like the thing,

41:05.200 --> 41:07.520
because my home directory was getting recreated

41:07.520 --> 41:10.560
on every reboot, so of course nothing was persisting.

41:10.560 --> 41:14.280
So as soon as I added that, that solved the problem,

41:14.280 --> 41:16.000
but it really, that was one of the moments

41:16.000 --> 41:18.600
that really solidified to me

41:18.600 --> 41:21.280
also some of the strengths of this approach,

41:21.280 --> 41:25.480
which is that everything you want or have defined

41:25.480 --> 41:28.960
is there when you reboot every time,

41:28.960 --> 41:31.120
and the cruft kind of goes away on every reboot,

41:31.120 --> 41:32.720
which is really fascinating.

41:32.720 --> 41:36.320
And another thing, Chris, that I've only got interested in,

41:36.320 --> 41:38.440
but I know you played with was

41:38.440 --> 41:42.680
that there's some modularity to the config file,

41:42.680 --> 41:44.600
which I thought was really fascinating.

41:44.600 --> 41:47.040
Yeah, back in my day, we called them includes, right?

41:47.040 --> 41:49.640
But they're just essentially sub-configuration files.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.320
And so I have like a vpn.nix

41:52.320 --> 41:56.800
that I can put on all of my Nix boxes, and I have,

41:56.800 --> 41:58.520
and it just defines everything

41:58.520 --> 42:00.960
to install and connect to tail scale,

42:00.960 --> 42:03.480
right as I build the system, it's so great.

42:03.480 --> 42:07.120
And Nev, I noticed something you said in the chat room,

42:07.120 --> 42:09.040
maybe you could mention here in the Mumba room,

42:09.040 --> 42:11.680
it kind of changes the way maybe you view a Linux box,

42:11.680 --> 42:13.120
and depending on your perspective,

42:13.120 --> 42:15.000
it seems pretty practical.

42:15.000 --> 42:19.080
Yes, as like the home labber,

42:19.080 --> 42:22.560
or like the last 12, 13, 14 years,

42:22.560 --> 42:26.400
I've ultimately learned that every Linux distribution

42:26.400 --> 42:29.640
that I've ever installed on a client system,

42:29.640 --> 42:32.440
I've always just learned to treat that as install

42:32.440 --> 42:33.960
as disposable.

42:33.960 --> 42:36.760
Right, I was just saying to Wes before the show too,

42:36.760 --> 42:40.120
it's like, it's a difference between a toy and a tool.

42:40.120 --> 42:42.680
NixOS feels very much like a tool.

42:42.680 --> 42:46.600
And if you take what Linux is really great at,

42:46.600 --> 42:48.160
and you turn it up to 11,

42:48.160 --> 42:50.480
I think it really exemplifies a lot of that.

42:50.480 --> 42:53.520
And I think it would make for a really good

42:53.520 --> 42:55.440
rock solid workstation for somebody like Brent.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.520
I think Brent, you'd be,

42:56.520 --> 42:58.320
I think once you wrapped your head around it,

42:58.320 --> 43:00.480
you'd have something that's super reliable for you,

43:00.480 --> 43:02.480
and probably safe and secure too.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.080
You know, something gets weird, you just reboot.

43:05.080 --> 43:05.920
That's nice.

43:05.920 --> 43:08.240
Well, and the rollback features too, seem really great,

43:08.240 --> 43:09.760
cause you can try something new for a little bit,

43:09.760 --> 43:11.080
and then roll back to them.

43:11.080 --> 43:15.360
So it integrates, I think, some modern technologies

43:15.360 --> 43:16.560
that I've been craving.

43:16.560 --> 43:20.560
So I, you might have tempted me, Chris.

43:20.560 --> 43:21.720
No, I do think it means, you know,

43:21.720 --> 43:23.600
you're kind of committing to staying

43:23.600 --> 43:26.000
at least a little bit engaged with the,

43:26.000 --> 43:27.200
you know, the Nix language,

43:27.200 --> 43:29.240
and understanding how Nix works a little bit,

43:29.240 --> 43:31.280
if you're gonna base all your systems around it.

43:31.280 --> 43:32.120
Yeah.

43:32.120 --> 43:33.960
So that's, you know, that's one thing to,

43:33.960 --> 43:36.240
similar with other like configuration management systems,

43:36.240 --> 43:38.720
where, you know, you gotta learn the language

43:38.720 --> 43:39.760
of the system that you're using.

43:39.760 --> 43:41.040
But if you're willing to do that,

43:41.040 --> 43:42.480
and that's where I'm kind of fascinated

43:42.480 --> 43:44.000
about this challenge to see,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.640
cause for me, you know, I'm a software developer by day,

43:46.640 --> 43:49.400
so kind of used to reading new programming languages,

43:49.400 --> 43:51.240
but I'm curious to see, and this is a, you know,

43:51.240 --> 43:55.960
sort of ML inspired, functional, pure, lazy.

43:55.960 --> 43:57.760
It's probably different than languages

43:57.760 --> 43:58.840
you guys have seen before.

43:58.840 --> 44:00.160
So I'm gonna be fascinated to see

44:00.160 --> 44:01.640
how you guys get on with it.

44:01.640 --> 44:05.920
I will totally admit upfront, full disclosure here,

44:05.920 --> 44:09.240
this aspect of Nix is probably why I have put this off

44:09.240 --> 44:10.560
for as long as I have,

44:10.560 --> 44:12.640
because the audience has been asking us

44:12.640 --> 44:16.560
to talk about Nix years, since like 2004.

44:16.560 --> 44:21.560
Well, but you know, the truth of the matter was,

44:21.920 --> 44:23.720
is I just felt like,

44:23.720 --> 44:27.400
is it worth learning something so specific and unique?

44:27.400 --> 44:30.280
But what I have realized is, and this is,

44:30.280 --> 44:32.240
I'm sure a lot of you out there can relate to this

44:32.240 --> 44:34.640
because you've probably experienced this.

44:34.640 --> 44:36.320
You maybe are like aware of something

44:36.320 --> 44:37.920
and then you begin to look into it

44:37.920 --> 44:40.120
and you begin to learn more about it

44:40.120 --> 44:43.800
and you discover it is an entire world unto itself

44:43.800 --> 44:48.160
that has a ginormous community with passionate contributors.

44:48.160 --> 44:50.760
And you just kind of, sometimes you just stumble

44:50.760 --> 44:52.840
across these kinds of things every now and then.

44:52.840 --> 44:54.680
You're like, oh, there's something wonderful here.

44:54.680 --> 44:55.600
That's Nix.

44:55.600 --> 44:58.360
And you realize this is worth investing in

44:58.360 --> 45:02.400
because this community and the available packages

45:02.400 --> 45:07.320
and everything is so rich, the payoff is obvious

45:07.320 --> 45:10.400
once you understand the depth of it.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.520
So that is a transition for me

45:12.520 --> 45:15.400
because I didn't really wanna have to take a,

45:15.400 --> 45:16.680
I didn't wanna have to go to school

45:16.680 --> 45:18.840
to figure out how to install my software.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.760
But now that I realize it's gonna help me solve

45:20.760 --> 45:23.160
these problems that I've been recently,

45:23.160 --> 45:24.400
I've had a mind shift change.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.480
And you guys have probably noticed a lot

45:26.480 --> 45:28.200
that we've talked more about Bitcoin,

45:28.200 --> 45:30.120
we've talked more about Boost,

45:30.120 --> 45:32.120
we've talked more about decentralized services

45:32.120 --> 45:33.560
like Matrix, we've been talking more

45:33.560 --> 45:36.600
about this kind of stuff because I've kind of recently,

45:36.600 --> 45:38.480
I don't know, maybe it's because I've turned 40,

45:38.480 --> 45:41.720
maybe that, maybe it's just because I've hit

45:41.720 --> 45:44.160
like the 15 year mark of doing podcasts

45:44.160 --> 45:46.880
and that kind of feels like a point to reflect.

45:46.880 --> 45:50.520
And I've been thinking about how I wanna build things

45:50.520 --> 45:53.920
for JB over the next couple of years.

45:53.920 --> 45:56.880
So that way it sort of just can run itself

45:56.880 --> 45:59.240
after a certain sustainable as possible.

45:59.240 --> 46:01.560
Yeah, and so that come,

46:01.560 --> 46:03.040
and that's been a full spectrum thing

46:03.040 --> 46:04.880
like how we distribute the shows,

46:04.880 --> 46:08.200
the backend infrastructure, the front end infrastructure,

46:08.200 --> 46:11.000
how we monetize the shows, all of that, right?

46:11.000 --> 46:11.900
That's all been in here.

46:11.900 --> 46:16.900
And so to come across Nix kind of during this time

46:17.440 --> 46:19.880
and seeing how it can solve some of the problems

46:19.880 --> 46:21.460
that I'm facing, that's a huge deal.

46:21.460 --> 46:23.760
And it reminds me very, very much

46:23.760 --> 46:26.600
of why I even started the Linux Action Show to begin with

46:26.600 --> 46:30.640
is I was in IT and I was crazy excited

46:30.640 --> 46:33.040
about the problems I was solving with Linux.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.900
And I just felt this undeniable urge.

46:35.900 --> 46:37.360
I just couldn't stop myself.

46:37.360 --> 46:39.040
I had to talk about it.

46:39.040 --> 46:40.920
I'm still that way today.

46:40.920 --> 46:44.280
And that was really my motivation for starting the show.

46:44.280 --> 46:46.800
And it was the problems that it was solving for me

46:46.800 --> 46:48.280
that I felt like I needed to tell people

46:48.280 --> 46:50.920
you could solve these problems with Linux.

46:50.920 --> 46:53.360
And like, it was things like Samba and NFS

46:53.360 --> 46:55.160
and Squid and Apache.

46:55.160 --> 46:57.560
And I just felt like the world 15 years ago

46:57.560 --> 47:00.400
it needed to know you could solve problems.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.480
And I feel like we're arriving at another precipice

47:03.480 --> 47:08.020
where Nix is solving some serious problems.

47:08.020 --> 47:09.440
And I'm really excited about that.

47:09.440 --> 47:13.360
And value for value models and lightning network payments

47:13.360 --> 47:15.760
and boosts are solving some real problems.

47:15.760 --> 47:17.440
And I'm very excited about that.

47:17.440 --> 47:19.820
And I just wanna pull on a conversation

47:19.820 --> 47:23.480
that I had with my co-host Mike and Coder 458.

47:23.480 --> 47:28.120
So we get into it more there, but a group

47:28.120 --> 47:33.120
that does studies of the podcast industry, Edison Research,

47:33.840 --> 47:36.160
recently published their latest version,

47:36.160 --> 47:37.280
they do one every year,

47:37.280 --> 47:40.040
of kind of a state of the podcasting industry.

47:41.080 --> 47:43.360
And last year when they did their report,

47:43.360 --> 47:45.080
if you wanted to reach 50%

47:45.080 --> 47:46.680
of all weekly podcast listeners.

47:46.680 --> 47:48.440
So if you're a, I'm talking about you,

47:48.440 --> 47:50.420
if you're a weekly podcast listener,

47:50.420 --> 47:54.540
and if you wanted to reach them as an advertiser,

47:54.540 --> 47:57.540
you targeted like the top seven podcast networks

47:57.540 --> 47:58.460
and platforms.

47:59.680 --> 48:01.560
But one year later now,

48:01.560 --> 48:03.920
there has been considerable acquisitions

48:03.920 --> 48:08.060
of independent shows and in just 12 months,

48:08.060 --> 48:10.500
now to get 50% of those weekly listeners,

48:10.500 --> 48:14.620
you only need to buy advertising on four podcast networks.

48:14.620 --> 48:16.800
So in one year, we went from seven to four,

48:16.800 --> 48:21.320
Spotify, iHeartRadio, NPR, SXM Media,

48:21.320 --> 48:22.460
these are the main platforms

48:22.460 --> 48:24.220
where people are consolidating to.

48:24.220 --> 48:27.180
And Edison Research ends with this quote,

48:27.180 --> 48:30.840
they say, if indie podcasters don't find a way

48:30.840 --> 48:33.460
to organize and consolidate their buying power,

48:33.460 --> 48:36.100
some monetization options are just not going

48:36.100 --> 48:38.380
to be available for them, for you.

48:39.980 --> 48:41.440
And I think what they're saying there

48:41.440 --> 48:43.300
is there's gonna be less and less advertisers

48:43.300 --> 48:45.740
because between platforms like YouTube

48:45.740 --> 48:47.500
and the fact that you can go to Spotify

48:47.500 --> 48:50.980
and iHeartRadio and NPR and get 50% of all listeners,

48:50.980 --> 48:53.380
why would you spend three to six months

48:53.380 --> 48:55.900
creating an ad deal with some, you know.

48:55.900 --> 48:58.100
Smalls and twos and, right.

48:58.100 --> 48:59.380
This is a dramatic problem.

48:59.380 --> 49:00.260
And I think recently I said,

49:00.260 --> 49:01.540
I think we have three to five years.

49:01.540 --> 49:03.980
I think we probably have two years at best.

49:03.980 --> 49:06.500
And this is something that I've kind of thought

49:06.500 --> 49:07.460
was coming for a while.

49:07.460 --> 49:10.180
That's why we launched the membership programs.

49:10.180 --> 49:12.080
That's why we have the Unplugged Core contributors.

49:12.080 --> 49:12.920
Thank you so much.

49:12.920 --> 49:14.780
And we also have the Jupiter Party.

49:14.780 --> 49:16.660
Like this has been part of hedging

49:16.660 --> 49:18.260
for the direction this is going.

49:18.260 --> 49:21.100
And we knew, I could tell personally,

49:21.100 --> 49:22.100
I could tell just maybe,

49:22.100 --> 49:24.340
I don't know if it was just the economy,

49:24.340 --> 49:26.460
if it was just, I don't know, the shift from work.

49:26.460 --> 49:29.660
Something changed in the advertising business

49:29.660 --> 49:32.100
and I could tell that we needed more runway.

49:32.100 --> 49:33.260
We needed more flexibility.

49:33.260 --> 49:34.900
I needed to be able to say no

49:34.900 --> 49:36.260
because we get all kinds of people

49:36.260 --> 49:38.280
that want to sell scams on air.

49:38.280 --> 49:40.900
They really just, all kinds of scammy stuff.

49:40.900 --> 49:42.700
And I have to be able to say no to that kind of stuff.

49:42.700 --> 49:46.020
And the membership programs have really been key to that.

49:46.020 --> 49:49.540
But it's like it can't be the only solution.

49:49.540 --> 49:52.900
So that's why we've been talking more about boosts

49:52.900 --> 49:56.940
and the podcasting 2.0 movement and value for value.

49:57.860 --> 49:59.940
And so that's why, again, I want to mention

49:59.940 --> 50:02.260
I'm having a live stream on March 31st.

50:02.260 --> 50:03.580
I'm going to give away some Bitcoin

50:03.580 --> 50:06.340
to help you load up a lightning wallet.

50:06.340 --> 50:09.100
I like Fountain FM as an app, Cast-O-Matic is a great app,

50:09.100 --> 50:11.500
but just go to newpodcastapps.com.

50:11.500 --> 50:13.700
There's always new apps getting added there.

50:13.700 --> 50:17.460
Anything that supports value for value and boosts will work.

50:17.460 --> 50:19.140
And you get that set up,

50:19.140 --> 50:21.140
we'll have all the details on the live stream.

50:21.140 --> 50:22.780
I'll help everybody kind of get started on that

50:22.780 --> 50:26.580
because my thinking here is that

50:26.580 --> 50:29.700
if we get some of the podcast listeners on this network

50:30.580 --> 50:33.500
and then an open source project comes online,

50:33.500 --> 50:35.500
they already have a network of listeners

50:35.500 --> 50:37.980
that are just ready and willing to support.

50:37.980 --> 50:40.580
So I'm not going to go on about this every episode.

50:40.580 --> 50:41.980
I really am not.

50:41.980 --> 50:45.620
But it is sort of, there is kind of this coming together

50:45.620 --> 50:50.500
of all of these almost kind of movements in history.

50:50.500 --> 50:53.220
And I want to just talk for a moment about it

50:53.220 --> 50:55.460
and then this will be the episode we address it

50:55.460 --> 50:57.700
and then we don't have to keep talking about it all the time.

50:57.700 --> 50:59.820
So I want to talk a little bit briefly

50:59.820 --> 51:01.620
about value for value

51:01.620 --> 51:04.060
because I think it applies to free software

51:04.060 --> 51:06.940
and I think it applies to content creation.

51:06.940 --> 51:08.180
And I think there's a lot of reasons

51:08.180 --> 51:10.780
why we should pay attention to these kinds of things.

51:11.740 --> 51:14.300
So Boost, Lightning and value for value

51:14.300 --> 51:16.500
are not all the same thing.

51:16.500 --> 51:18.300
We talk about them all a lot together

51:18.300 --> 51:20.100
but they are not the same thing.

51:20.100 --> 51:23.100
Value for value is a support and content model.

51:23.100 --> 51:25.460
It was pioneered by Adam Curry and John C. Dvorak

51:25.460 --> 51:27.580
about 15, 14 years ago.

51:28.460 --> 51:30.380
And as time has gone on,

51:30.380 --> 51:31.780
it has sort of continued to prove out

51:31.780 --> 51:34.460
for various different reasons that that model

51:34.460 --> 51:36.460
is likely the most sustainable model

51:36.460 --> 51:38.420
for independent content.

51:38.420 --> 51:43.420
And the idea is very simply as the name implies,

51:44.300 --> 51:47.420
we, Jupiter Broadcasting, all of us here,

51:47.420 --> 51:48.740
all of us on the show,

51:48.740 --> 51:50.340
we put our value into the show,

51:50.340 --> 51:53.380
our time, our talent and our treasure.

51:53.380 --> 51:55.540
The audience gives value in return,

51:55.540 --> 51:57.780
your time, your talent or your treasure.

51:57.780 --> 52:00.340
Your time can be maybe helping out in the JB community

52:00.340 --> 52:01.980
like so many people do.

52:01.980 --> 52:04.220
Maybe you're like Cole or New West,

52:04.220 --> 52:06.220
you come up to the studio or the RV

52:06.220 --> 52:08.580
or maybe you just take your time

52:08.580 --> 52:10.700
to introduce someone to the show, right?

52:10.700 --> 52:12.580
That is a contribution,

52:12.580 --> 52:14.860
that is value given back to the show.

52:14.860 --> 52:17.980
Your talent could maybe be helping out JB

52:17.980 --> 52:19.820
with something that's social.

52:19.820 --> 52:23.100
Maybe it's code, maybe it's mechanical, right?

52:23.100 --> 52:26.100
It's something you're taking your unique talent

52:26.100 --> 52:29.860
and you're helping contribute value back using that talent.

52:29.860 --> 52:31.620
And of course, treasure is really straightforward

52:31.620 --> 52:34.900
and it's often the most available to anybody who's busy,

52:34.900 --> 52:36.620
has a lot going on.

52:36.620 --> 52:38.700
It's, you're often in a position

52:38.700 --> 52:42.580
where you don't have time to contribute your talent,

52:42.580 --> 52:44.140
your skills, you've got a lot going on.

52:44.140 --> 52:47.260
So value is the most straightforward way to contribute.

52:47.260 --> 52:48.780
And the Lightning Network

52:49.980 --> 52:52.460
is a free software peer-to-peer payment network

52:52.460 --> 52:54.420
that enables sending fractions of a penny

52:54.420 --> 52:58.180
for stupid cheap fees to send that value.

52:58.180 --> 53:02.140
Boosts are a brand new way to send messages into the show

53:02.140 --> 53:04.740
along with a contribution of value

53:04.740 --> 53:06.700
which is sent over that peer-to-peer

53:06.700 --> 53:08.300
free software Lightning Network.

53:09.420 --> 53:11.460
And to give the boosters value back,

53:11.460 --> 53:14.300
we try to read as many of those boosts here on the show

53:14.300 --> 53:15.820
as we can,

53:15.820 --> 53:17.580
because that's kind of the content aspect,

53:17.580 --> 53:20.540
one of the content aspects of the value for value model.

53:20.540 --> 53:23.660
If you send us a boost as a thank you in return for value,

53:23.660 --> 53:25.500
we try to read that on the show.

53:25.500 --> 53:27.940
This model, if you think about what I'm talking about here

53:27.940 --> 53:31.020
and you remove the technologies like Lightning or PayPal

53:31.020 --> 53:32.220
or whatever it might be,

53:32.220 --> 53:34.300
this is a platform agnostic model

53:34.300 --> 53:36.700
that can be applied to whatever model works for your business.

53:36.700 --> 53:40.260
So in our case, it's a combination of memberships,

53:40.260 --> 53:42.940
direct value for value, treasure contributions,

53:42.940 --> 53:45.980
and more and more limited sponsorships, right?

53:45.980 --> 53:49.300
It's kind of like a basket of these revenue sources.

53:49.300 --> 53:53.660
It is a model that can be resistant to content censorship

53:53.660 --> 53:56.020
because the advertisers are just part of that basket.

53:56.020 --> 53:58.740
We could, in theory, eliminate them.

53:58.740 --> 54:01.820
And because it is not necessarily dependent on people,

54:01.820 --> 54:05.420
dependent on a PayPal or a Stripe or a Patreon,

54:05.420 --> 54:07.980
it is a sustainable platform.

54:07.980 --> 54:10.940
So not only is it resistant to censorship,

54:10.940 --> 54:14.740
but it's a sustainable platform for the next 15 years of JB.

54:14.740 --> 54:17.740
And the way we're using it with Lightning Payments,

54:17.740 --> 54:21.100
the entire stack is built on free software

54:21.100 --> 54:24.140
and runs on Linux, the entire stack.

54:24.140 --> 54:27.660
For the first time ever in the history of my business,

54:27.660 --> 54:29.820
the payment stuff is now running on Linux.

54:29.820 --> 54:31.340
This is huge, right?

54:31.340 --> 54:33.620
Completely self-hostable.

54:33.620 --> 54:36.620
And because the actual value side of it,

54:36.620 --> 54:39.340
the monetary side of it in the value for value system

54:39.340 --> 54:41.020
comes from the audience,

54:41.020 --> 54:43.660
it's as sustainable as there is an audience.

54:43.660 --> 54:45.340
It's powered by the audience.

54:45.340 --> 54:47.860
So this is a 15-year solution.

54:47.860 --> 54:51.900
And it's a strategy that aligns completely with JB's values.

54:51.900 --> 54:53.660
Like this makes a lot of sense.

54:53.660 --> 54:55.660
It's using free software.

54:55.660 --> 54:57.900
It's orienting our primary focus towards the audience

54:57.900 --> 54:59.300
as our main customer.

54:59.300 --> 55:01.500
And I think we're figuring all of this out

55:01.500 --> 55:04.900
at a critical moment in podcasting and mark my words,

55:04.900 --> 55:07.340
this is a path that we are going down

55:07.340 --> 55:10.180
that other podcasters are going to follow.

55:10.180 --> 55:13.460
And eventually I think free software projects will follow.

55:13.460 --> 55:15.140
This I think has a lot of potential.

55:15.140 --> 55:17.140
And so that's why it's been brought up more on here

55:17.140 --> 55:18.460
because it's just,

55:18.460 --> 55:20.820
it's like a matrix of all this stuff coming together, Wes.

55:20.820 --> 55:22.660
Yeah, there's a lot going on right now.

55:22.660 --> 55:24.820
Yeah, there is a lot going on right now.

55:24.820 --> 55:28.180
And so that's just sort of the phase of the time

55:28.180 --> 55:29.060
that this show is in.

55:29.060 --> 55:30.820
This show has done this before.

55:30.820 --> 55:32.540
Like I've said before,

55:32.540 --> 55:34.260
you have your Star Trek The Next Generation,

55:34.260 --> 55:36.380
which is Planet Monster of the Week.

55:36.380 --> 55:38.740
Great show, really good show, right?

55:38.740 --> 55:40.540
That's Linux action news, right?

55:40.540 --> 55:42.380
That's Linux action news.

55:42.380 --> 55:44.380
And then you got your Deep Space Nine

55:44.380 --> 55:46.100
where you got your character development,

55:46.100 --> 55:48.860
you got your story arcs that go over a whole season.

55:48.860 --> 55:50.500
Surprising betrayals.

55:50.500 --> 55:54.700
Don't even get me started on Kai Win and Golda Khan.

55:54.700 --> 55:56.300
But you know, that's what this show is, right?

55:56.300 --> 55:58.380
And this is that phase.

55:58.380 --> 56:00.940
And you can probably feel it, I would imagine.

56:00.940 --> 56:02.460
If you've been listening for a while,

56:02.460 --> 56:03.500
you can probably tell.

56:04.380 --> 56:07.420
And if you're savvy enough in this particular area,

56:07.420 --> 56:09.940
you can probably get a sense that I might be right,

56:10.820 --> 56:13.140
but the implications are a little scary

56:13.140 --> 56:15.700
and the details seem a little difficult.

56:15.700 --> 56:18.420
And I acknowledge I have gotten really passionate

56:18.420 --> 56:19.740
about this.

56:19.740 --> 56:22.180
You know, I've jabbed ribs when I didn't really need to

56:22.180 --> 56:26.060
because this is my baby, right?

56:26.060 --> 56:30.020
These shows, podcasting, it's my life's work at this point.

56:30.020 --> 56:31.980
I've been making podcasts since listeners

56:31.980 --> 56:34.220
were burning them to CDs

56:34.220 --> 56:36.860
and listening to Linux action show

56:36.860 --> 56:39.980
and cast a blast on their CDs in their car.

56:39.980 --> 56:41.740
Pretty sure you've been making this kind of stuff

56:41.740 --> 56:43.780
before I knew what Linux was.

56:43.780 --> 56:47.460
And so it's really at a fragile,

56:47.460 --> 56:49.420
interesting inflection point.

56:49.420 --> 56:52.740
And to see research that sort of really demonstrates that,

56:52.740 --> 56:54.340
even though I knew it already,

56:54.340 --> 56:56.700
it kind of does make it a little more alarming.

56:56.700 --> 56:58.660
And it seems like we have an opportunity here

56:58.660 --> 57:00.420
to build a network.

57:00.420 --> 57:02.300
And the great thing about it is like,

57:02.300 --> 57:05.140
it's not super easy to get started today.

57:05.140 --> 57:07.980
I admit the onboarding is a pain in the ass right now.

57:07.980 --> 57:10.020
And by the way, if you're in the US,

57:10.020 --> 57:12.260
the easy way is just to get the Strike app.

57:12.260 --> 57:14.660
It's really low fees, it's a good team,

57:14.660 --> 57:15.900
it's a good simple app.

57:15.900 --> 57:18.580
You can buy just a small, tiny amount,

57:18.580 --> 57:20.700
a couple of bucks worth of Bitcoin

57:20.700 --> 57:24.060
and you can send it via lightning to your podcast app.

57:24.060 --> 57:26.220
The Strike app, get a little bit in there,

57:26.220 --> 57:28.020
you send it to your podcast app, you're done.

57:28.020 --> 57:28.940
It takes minutes.

57:28.940 --> 57:30.620
It's really nice.

57:30.620 --> 57:33.140
If you're outside the US or even in the US,

57:33.140 --> 57:37.380
Blue Wallet is a really good, safe, trustworthy

57:37.380 --> 57:40.300
mobile wallet for Android and iOS

57:40.300 --> 57:43.780
that has in-app purchases for Bitcoin

57:43.780 --> 57:47.380
that you can then send over lightning to your podcast app.

57:47.380 --> 57:50.460
And I am risking pissing off a lot of my audience

57:50.460 --> 57:52.660
by talking about this so much.

57:52.660 --> 57:54.220
That's a real problem we have.

57:54.220 --> 57:56.820
People are sick and tired of hearing about this.

57:56.820 --> 57:58.380
But what would you do?

57:58.380 --> 58:01.220
What would you do if you help pioneer a medium

58:01.220 --> 58:04.420
and you have worked your ass off for 15 years full time

58:04.420 --> 58:06.420
to make that medium possible

58:06.420 --> 58:09.460
and now you see something that is an existential threat to it

58:09.460 --> 58:14.460
and you see something that has a real possible solution,

58:15.020 --> 58:17.140
a real network effect is being built here.

58:17.140 --> 58:18.100
And the great thing is,

58:18.100 --> 58:20.540
is while onboarding is a pain in the ass today,

58:20.540 --> 58:23.500
there's a lot of companies working on that, right?

58:23.500 --> 58:25.580
This is a problem because it's an open network.

58:25.580 --> 58:27.260
It's like SMTP.

58:27.260 --> 58:29.060
It's like POP3.

58:29.060 --> 58:30.780
Other people are building solutions

58:30.780 --> 58:34.020
on top of this open network and they're solving problems

58:34.020 --> 58:35.220
and they're making it easier.

58:35.220 --> 58:38.300
So today, yeah, it's a pain in the butt

58:38.300 --> 58:39.380
and it seems kind of hard.

58:39.380 --> 58:41.620
You gotta, like for the podcast hosts,

58:41.620 --> 58:43.580
you gotta get this umbral thing

58:43.580 --> 58:46.060
and then you gotta go figure out what the podcast index is

58:46.060 --> 58:48.180
and then you gotta figure out how to embed a value tag.

58:48.180 --> 58:50.020
I mean, that just all sounds really complicated.

58:50.020 --> 58:51.740
You gotta do it on all of your feeds.

58:51.740 --> 58:53.780
Right, and then as the audience,

58:53.780 --> 58:55.700
you gotta figure out how to get your hands on,

58:55.700 --> 58:58.180
it doesn't have to be a lot of Bitcoin, but a few,

58:58.180 --> 58:59.660
like a few pennies worth

58:59.660 --> 59:01.140
and you gotta figure out how to then put that in a wallet

59:01.140 --> 59:03.380
and it's all very complicated today.

59:03.380 --> 59:04.300
But let me tell you,

59:04.300 --> 59:07.260
I've been talking about this for 12 years, Bitcoin

59:07.260 --> 59:12.260
and it is so much easier today than it was 12 years ago

59:13.060 --> 59:15.300
to get your hands on this safely

59:15.300 --> 59:18.060
and to just have a really slick experience.

59:18.060 --> 59:20.260
It's like, it's like Linux.

59:20.260 --> 59:21.460
It just keeps getting better.

59:21.460 --> 59:22.940
The experience just keeps getting better.

59:22.940 --> 59:24.580
People keep building on top of it

59:24.580 --> 59:27.660
and when you revisit it, you realize, wow,

59:27.660 --> 59:29.540
something has really changed here.

59:29.540 --> 59:31.500
It's that same kind of effect.

59:31.500 --> 59:33.580
So that's my end of my soapbox.

59:33.580 --> 59:34.420
It's done.

59:34.420 --> 59:36.620
I'm really gonna try not to talk about it anymore.

59:36.620 --> 59:38.540
In part, this comes up because the live stream

59:38.540 --> 59:39.820
is March 31st.

59:39.820 --> 59:42.140
That's sort of the apex of all of this.

59:42.140 --> 59:44.260
After we give the Bitcoin away

59:44.260 --> 59:46.700
and we get people loaded up with their wallets,

59:46.700 --> 59:47.940
we'll be done talking about it.

59:47.940 --> 59:50.420
And I do wanna mention,

59:50.420 --> 59:51.940
because I think this is noteworthy

59:51.940 --> 59:53.740
and I think it's really awesome,

59:53.740 --> 59:55.580
Bearded Tech, who is a listener,

59:55.580 --> 01:00:00.580
who is working on an open source project called Fever,

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.980
which is a Frigate event video recorder.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:06.580
It works alongside the Frigate video recording system

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.620
that works with Home Assistant

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:09.380
that you can plug your cameras into.

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.580
Yeah, this just looks great.

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.020
Yeah, it's like a free self-hosted camera viewing app.

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.780
It's really nice.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:17.420
And he's built some really cool features in Fever

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.700
and he's just a few days away

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.620
from putting his project on the Lightning Network

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:24.500
to take contributions as a value for value model

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.060
and to take that value over Lightning.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:30.780
He will be one, but the next person will start a trend

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.220
and it just kind of grows from there.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:35.140
And what an opportunity we have right now.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.540
So of course I have to talk about it.

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:41.140
It's almost negligent because quite frankly,

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:43.260
I think most of my peer group

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.540
doesn't even understand what the hell I'm talking about.

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:47.340
And so they're not gonna talk about it

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:50.420
because it's so damn complicated

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.660
and there's scams around every corner.

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:54.700
They don't wanna go on air and tell you guys

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.580
to do something that's gonna get you scammed

01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:57.420
or something like that.

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.100
Like they're just gonna sit this out for a bit.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:01.140
Let Chris figure it out.

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:01.980
You know what?

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.020
He figured out a lot of this stuff first, right?

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:05.540
Let him figure this one out.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:08.860
He can burn his ass on this, piss everybody off.

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.740
And then if it actually works out,

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.100
then I'll sign up and we'll get it working.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:12.940
It'll be fine, right?

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:14.700
Like that's the state of things.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.020
So that's what we're doing here right now.

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.860
That's the stage we're in, but it's moving quick.

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:23.420
So anyways, join me for the apex of it on March 31st.

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.660
And before we get out of here,

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:27.980
why don't we do some boosts?

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.980
And now as the French say, it is time for the boost.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:38.140
Well, Jay wrote in two days ago.

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.180
Thanks Jay.

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:42.300
He says, you convinced me boosts.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.220
I'm already a fan of the brave browser

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.180
and its model to use attention tokens

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.380
to give back to creators.

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:53.380
Longtime Linux user, first distro was MCC Linux in 1994.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.660
Once a career and now a hobby again,

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.860
I've become a system admin of humans

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:00.860
rather than machines, IES psychologist.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:02.780
And that's why it's fun again.

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:03.820
Love your podcasts.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.420
A sys admin of humans.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:06.500
That's amazing.

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.220
Isn't that great?

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:09.140
I like brave.

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:12.020
I'm still figuring out if I like the bat tokens.

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.020
I think I get it, you know,

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.500
but I'm still, I'd love people's input on that too.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.020
Send us a boost and let us know what you think about that.

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:22.860
The coin lizard also wrote in with 25,000 sats.

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.220
Chris, I've been listening to you

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.460
since roughly episode 60 of Linux action show.

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.300
Wow.

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.820
Yeah, I know.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:31.900
I took my first hard look at Bitcoin

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.300
as a result of your podcast plan B.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.860
Do you remember that?

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:39.060
I'm happy to see you promoting the value for value model

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.260
from the lightning networks.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.980
It's truly powerful to be able to support content creators

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:46.540
in an uncensorable way.

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:48.100
Thank you for the amazing content

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.020
that you've provided for the last 15 years.

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.260
We don't have to read that part.

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:52.100
Don't read, that's embarrassing.

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:52.940
Well, I don't know.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.660
It seems kind of nice, but all right.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.700
Thank you Bitcoin lizard for sending that in.

01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.980
I hope you made a good chunk of money.

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:01.900
Cause if you've been listening since plan B,

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:04.660
I looked at the last recorded episode of plan B

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:08.740
and I think the price of Bitcoin at that time was $124.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.860
A different era.

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:15.300
NorCalGeek boosts in with 5,000 sets.

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:19.460
Commenting on Linux Unplugged 450 went real bad.

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:23.220
I enjoyed the GNOME 42 review slash preview.

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.820
Looking forward to getting it at Fedora 36.

01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:27.300
Yeah, us too.

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:28.860
Keep up the great work.

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:30.420
I appreciate your honesty.

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:32.020
Ah, thank you NorCal.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:32.860
Miss you.

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:34.580
It's been a while since we've been able to meet up with him.

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:35.860
Yeah, no kidding.

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:37.980
By the way, I saw that OpenSUSE at Tumbleweed

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.660
shipped 42 this week.

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.580
So they technically, they got it first.

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.020
We got to give them credit.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.500
Also Clear Linux shipped it.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:49.660
So got to give a Clear Linux some credit too.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.540
Go get that GNOME 42, however you have to get it.

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:56.020
Remaking Eden wrote in three days ago with a thousand sets

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.860
also in response to episode 450 said,

01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:59.980
I really hope that the value for value movement

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:01.620
gathers momentum.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:03.540
It's the first so-called web three project

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:06.900
I felt like I can get behind and we'll do some good.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.620
I'd hate for Spotify to gobble up something as important

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:11.540
as podcasts.

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:13.500
Web three is kind of a nebulous term,

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:18.500
which I guess can encompass anything that has blockchain.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:19.940
Value for value itself, again,

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:23.140
that's a content and monetization model.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:26.420
Lightning is the payment network, right?

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.180
And Bitcoin is the form of payment.

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:30.340
Does that make sense?

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:31.180
Yeah, right.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.900
And you can use those things to implement something

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.660
in the value for value system.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:36.780
You got it, you got it, you got it.

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:40.500
Matthew wrote in 5,000 sats four days ago.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.220
He says, hi, thanks for the show.

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:46.620
Do you know when Fountain will support Apple CarPlay?

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.700
That's the only thing that keeps me on Apple podcasts.

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.820
Fountain, yes, does not yet support Android auto

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:57.340
or CarPlay, but I happen to have it from a reliable source

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.300
that it is the number one requested feature

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:02.380
and that it is going to be released soon.

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:03.220
Thanks.

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.060
Yeah.

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.420
Eric Padre writes in four days ago with 2,000 sats.

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.100
Let's go Linux community and lightning.

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.980
Let's bootstrap this fantastic idea.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.900
And that was it.

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:14.740
That's it.

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:15.580
That's a short one.

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:16.420
I expected there to be more,

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:18.220
but then I realized the other bullet points

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.420
were just notes to ourselves.

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.260
You know, there's a character maximum,

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:23.740
not a character minimum, Chris.

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:24.580
You know what?

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:25.580
I like the short ones actually.

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.420
Thank you everybody.

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:27.740
Thank you for sending those in.

01:05:27.740 --> 01:05:28.940
So the way you send in a boost

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.260
is you go to newpodcastapps.com.

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.860
You get an app that supports boost like Fountain.

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.500
You charge up that lightning wallet

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.820
and then you send one in.

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:37.940
Boost to grand.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.540
Yeah, that's great.

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:40.540
That's, I don't know.

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:44.340
I feel like I've officially got it out of my system

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:47.060
and this live stream thing's happening this Thursday.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.460
I hope you'll join us.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.100
We have a special guest that's gonna join us

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:51.700
and do a brief interview.

01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.060
We're gonna do the Bitcoin giveaway.

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.700
Of course, we're also gonna help you get Matrix set up.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.780
And last but not least, of course,

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.140
somebody, a friend, maybe Wes, is gonna join me.

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:01.980
We'll chat.

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.820
I don't know.

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:03.660
I feel like there's something else I'm forgetting

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:04.580
that's gonna be on the live stream,

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:05.620
but we have a good show planned.

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:07.580
Said special guest, right?

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.140
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:10.180
Bitcoin giveaway.

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:11.020
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:11.860
Matrix set up.

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:12.700
Ask Chris anything.

01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:14.660
The AMA stuff, that's what I was forgetting.

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:16.860
Oh, I thought you were gonna say Levi there for a sec.

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:18.420
Maybe he could make a special appearance.

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.620
I mean, he's kinda, you know, he's hard to get.

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:21.780
Yeah. He's booked out.

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:22.620
That's true.

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.060
If you'd like to get more show,

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:26.060
go check out linuxactionnews.com.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:29.100
Wes took the week off, but he'll be back this week, right?

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:29.940
Yeah. Right?

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.540
Of course. Of course.

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.380
We cover the tech news, what's going on.

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:37.460
Don't miss a single episode, linuxactionnews.com.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:41.580
It's like, we should probably consider a combo feed.

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.300
Now that I think about it.

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.140
Whoa.

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:45.420
We have the all shows feed, but we should-

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.260
Right.

01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:47.380
We should, if people be interested,

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:48.700
send us a boost, tell us that.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.500
Yeah. Arbitrary feed remixes?

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.340
Yeah.

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:55.340
And also you can always join us on Sunday at jblive.tv.

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.460
We do the show at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.180
We got the mumble room going.

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.060
That's always a lot of fun.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.180
We got the chat room going.

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.740
We don't have the JBLive FM stream going at the moment,

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:07.460
but we will be working on that.

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:08.460
We will.

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.540
That is in the plans.

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:10.380
Just went out, okay?

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.020
But links to everything we talked about today

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.700
are at linuxunplug.com slash 451.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.180
The show's RSS feeds are over there.

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:19.140
If you'd like to send it to somebody,

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:20.940
recommend your favorite episode and send them a link.

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.780
We appreciate that a whole bunch.

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:25.860
And of course, join us on our matrix.

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.460
Details on our website.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.940
Thanks so much for joining this week's episode

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:29.980
of the Unplugged program.

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.940
See you right back here next Sunday.

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.340
We'll be right back.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:08:03.300
The Unplugged program is brought to you by

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:13.540
All right, JBtitles.com, let's go title this thing.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.380
It's worth mentioning before we get out of here,

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:17.860
we talked all about NICs this week,

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:22.980
but Fedora 36 and Ubuntu 2204 have their betas coming out.

01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:26.140
And both these are big releases because 36 has that nice,

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:29.340
beautiful upstream GNOME 42.

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:34.060
And of course, 2204, it's gonna be an LTS.

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.340
So that's also one that really could have some value

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:39.140
to get as much testing as possible,

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.900
because that just has a lot of long-term benefits

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:43.420
for the Ubuntu community.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.660
So that's exciting.

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:45.740
It's a busy week.

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.980
Get out there and get your beta.

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:50.220
Yeah, right.

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:53.540
Which, you know, I gotta get 2204 going again,

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.220
because I got 36 installed right now.

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.060
Same, yeah.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:59.100
Hmm, but I feel like I need to give 2204

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.580
a couple of weeks.

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:02.660
There's a lot going on.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:03.220
There's too much.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.420
And we got the NICs challenge.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:07.300
Plus then, during the middle of April,

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.140
we're traveling, or the early part of April.

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:11.580
So that's kind of one of the reasons

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.500
why I wanted to make the NICs challenge a month long,

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.860
is because I wanted to give people who are busy

01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:18.020
a chance to participate.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:18.820
Smart.

01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:21.340
Yeah, and also, since all of us are

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:25.580
traveling to North Carolina in a couple of weeks,

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.900
I don't think there'll be a lot of NICs testing going on that

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:29.220
week for the JV crew.

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:32.140
So I wanted to give us a little extra time in there.

01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:33.780
We have some pretty long flight rides,

01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:35.780
so I feel like there might be NICs in the air.

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:37.380
Hadea and I are already talking, though,

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:39.780
about maybe watching a new TV series during that time.

01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:41.980
So that time may already be claimed.

01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:43.860
You know, that's the debate right now.

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:45.380
I was thinking of Wes, really.

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:45.940
Come on.

01:09:45.940 --> 01:09:46.820
Oh, yeah.

01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.380
Wes will probably spend his entire time

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.820
just trying to hack the in-flight Wi-Fi

01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.700
to get free internet.

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:51.700
That's always so fun.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:58.060
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
