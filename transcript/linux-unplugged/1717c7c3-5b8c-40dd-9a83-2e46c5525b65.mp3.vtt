00:00.000 --> 00:08.080
Over at the Minimalists, if you can say it, Minimalists.com, here's a post about killing

00:08.080 --> 00:12.280
my home internet is the most productive thing I've ever done.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.920
Earlier this year, I made the conscious decision to remove all internet service from my home.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.760
It ended up being the best productivity decision I've ever made.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.400
I was not content with the time I was wasting.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.320
I felt I could do more purposeful things with my time than spend it on the internet.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.300
This doesn't mean I think the internet is evil, bad, or wrong.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.300
It's not.

00:28.300 --> 00:31.340
Internet is an amazing tool, one that changed my life for the better.

00:31.340 --> 00:32.680
But you run a popular website.

00:32.680 --> 00:36.700
How could you possibly go without internet service at home, you might ask?

00:36.700 --> 00:38.280
My answer is easy.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.920
I plan my internet use.

00:39.920 --> 00:41.680
I don't do so in a regimented way.

00:41.680 --> 00:45.300
It's not like I say, okay, I'll be on Twitter from two to four next Thursday.

00:45.300 --> 00:48.440
If I see something I want to research on the internet, I write it down and use that list

00:48.440 --> 00:50.640
when I have internet access.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.160
So I thought that was a really interesting approach.

00:52.160 --> 00:56.880
I know I've certainly had times where, you know, even if I am being productive, it's

00:56.880 --> 00:58.320
very easy to get distracted.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.480
You're on the Linux subreddit or Hacker News or a million other places, or you put on a

01:01.480 --> 01:04.280
J.B. show.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.480
Does anyone else have, like, productivity tips?

01:06.480 --> 01:07.480
Does anyone else do this?

01:07.480 --> 01:10.560
It kind of reminds me of Stallman's practice of, you know, getting online, syncing all

01:10.560 --> 01:14.320
this stuff, writing offline replies, and then syncing back up with the internet.

01:14.320 --> 01:19.120
I don't think it's something I would want to do in my day-to-day life, but it does make

01:19.120 --> 01:24.380
me think about how I think about my internet access and how I plan my time.

01:24.380 --> 01:41.720
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 192, for April 11, 2017.

01:41.720 --> 01:45.660
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's kidnapped the host of Ask

01:45.660 --> 01:50.060
Noah and we're forcing him to answer all our toughest Linux questions.

01:50.060 --> 01:51.520
My name is Wes.

01:51.520 --> 01:52.520
My name is Noah.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.520
Hey, welcome to the show, Noah.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.120
Thank you for joining us this week.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.120
We very much appreciate it.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.120
How are you doing?

01:57.120 --> 01:58.120
Happy, happy, happy to be kidnapped.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.120
Excellent.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.240
Well, we've got an excellent show today, jam-packed.

02:02.240 --> 02:05.200
Starting out, we've got some new projects we're going to highlight, some updates on

02:05.200 --> 02:07.920
all of our favorite open source projects.

02:07.920 --> 02:11.720
And then with the end of the Linux action show coming up, I thought it might be fun.

02:11.720 --> 02:15.200
You know, Linux Unplugged started out as a follow-up show to the Linux action show, kind

02:15.200 --> 02:18.040
of as a way for the community to engage with the topics.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.880
Since then, we've kind of gone our own way, diverged a bit.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.540
We frequently talk about different topics.

02:22.540 --> 02:25.480
But since the Linux action show is going away, I thought it might be fun this time.

02:25.480 --> 02:30.080
And since that last Linux action show, boy, howdy, that was a powerful show.

02:30.080 --> 02:34.920
I thought it'd be fun maybe if we returned in spirit to the origins of Linux Unplugged.

02:34.920 --> 02:38.260
So if people have questions for Noah and they want to talk a little bit about the Dell stuff

02:38.260 --> 02:40.720
or know if there's anything that you want to talk about that you didn't get time to

02:40.720 --> 02:42.620
talk about on the show, we can do that.

02:42.620 --> 02:46.400
And of course, we need to talk about the big news, the news everyone's talking about.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.400
That's right.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.720
Ubuntu, dropping mirror, going to GNOME.

02:50.720 --> 02:56.320
So I think to do that, we really need the people that make this show what it is, our

02:56.320 --> 02:58.240
mumble room.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.840
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.760
Greetings, appropriate greetings.

03:03.760 --> 03:04.760
Hello.

03:04.760 --> 03:08.520
How's everyone doing today?

03:08.520 --> 03:10.960
It's Biffy.

03:10.960 --> 03:11.960
Excellent.

03:11.960 --> 03:12.960
Excellent.

03:12.960 --> 03:20.360
Okay, so starting out today, I thought we'd talk about something.

03:20.360 --> 03:25.080
We've talked about a little bit before, we've definitely covered it, and it's the Pinebook.

03:25.080 --> 03:29.360
I just saw this update here that says the Pinebook Linux laptop is ready to ship for

03:29.360 --> 03:31.920
$89 and up, plus shipping, of course.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.400
So we've talked about it a little bit before, but not with our friend Noah.

03:35.400 --> 03:39.400
So the Pinebook is a cheap, low-power laptop with an ARM-based processor.

03:39.400 --> 03:43.340
First unveiled in November, the Pinebook comes from the makers of the Pine A64 single-board

03:43.340 --> 03:47.120
computer and uses the same processor as that tiny desktop.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.920
Now the company is getting ready to begin shipping laptops to customers.

03:49.920 --> 03:55.480
Prices start at just $89 for a model with an 11.6-inch display, or $99 for a 14-inch

03:55.480 --> 03:56.480
version.

03:56.480 --> 04:00.760
But shipping from Hong Kong can add as much as $37 to the price, depending on where you

04:00.760 --> 04:01.760
live.

04:01.760 --> 04:05.480
It's available through a build-to-order system, so you enter your email address and choose

04:05.480 --> 04:08.640
a screen size and then wait for the sales team to contact you.

04:08.640 --> 04:14.560
It's got a 64-bit all-winner A64 ARM Cortex-A53 quad-core processor, two gigabytes of RAM,

04:14.560 --> 04:22.400
16 gigabytes of eMMC storage, BGN Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, some USB 2.0 parts, a microSD card slot, headphone

04:22.400 --> 04:24.160
jack, and a mini HDMI port.

04:24.160 --> 04:27.600
Is this something that you might be interested in there, Mr. Noah?

04:27.600 --> 04:28.920
Very much so, for a number of reasons.

04:28.920 --> 04:33.560
The first is I think that it's important to acknowledge that we now live in a world where

04:33.560 --> 04:35.280
the laptop is predominant, right?

04:35.280 --> 04:39.400
You know, in the past, people would build their desktops, people had powerful workstations.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.320
These days, if you go to the Googles, if you go to the Amazon, certainly during my time

04:43.320 --> 04:47.760
at Dell, there are not a lot of people working on desktops, and the people that do work on

04:47.760 --> 04:51.520
quote-unquote desktops, if you look at them carefully, they're not desktops.

04:51.520 --> 04:55.880
They're desktop screens, desktop keyboards and mice connected to docking stations.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.000
They're actually working on laptops.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.020
I think that's the first thing to point out, that the world is transitioning towards a

05:00.020 --> 05:01.020
world of laptops.

05:01.020 --> 05:02.920
Yeah, I think that's a good point.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.460
And then I'd add to that that I think that the ARM platform is particularly compelling

05:06.460 --> 05:11.040
for those of us that like Linux because really, we dominate that space.

05:11.040 --> 05:16.080
You know, Windows is not competitive on the ARM platform, to say the least.

05:16.080 --> 05:21.400
Mac OS is not competitive on the ARM platform, to say the least, at least as a desktop platform

05:21.400 --> 05:22.400
goes.

05:22.400 --> 05:28.040
So I think that the more competition we have in the processor architecture space, the better

05:28.040 --> 05:32.120
chance we have for Linux to take off as a desktop platform.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.560
Yeah, I think that's definitely a good point.

05:35.560 --> 05:39.520
It's somewhere where we maybe even have a little bit of an advantage, you know, especially

05:39.520 --> 05:42.280
from the open source side of things, it's really easy to get things to work.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.280
Sure, there's some differences.

05:43.280 --> 05:46.640
But if you have access to the source code, it's really easy to start pointing those things

05:46.640 --> 05:49.920
to different architectures.

05:49.920 --> 05:50.920
What about you guys?

05:50.920 --> 05:53.360
Anyone interested in something like this?

05:53.360 --> 05:57.960
Well, I would be, I don't like the fact that it's all winter.

05:57.960 --> 06:01.840
But other than that, it's interesting as far as like the price goes.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.840
I don't think it even ships with an operating system, does it?

06:04.840 --> 06:06.200
You know, that's a good question.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.200
I'm not sure.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.800
Yeah, I'm kind of wondering if they're pushing Android for this just because that's what

06:10.800 --> 06:13.320
they were pushing for the Pine 64 in the first place.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.320
Oh, yeah.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.680
It generically says Linux or optional Android.

06:17.680 --> 06:22.320
Yeah, I feel like it really means Android because the upstream main line Linux support

06:22.320 --> 06:24.880
is pretty terrible on the Pine 64 still.

06:24.880 --> 06:25.880
Really?

06:25.880 --> 06:27.760
Yeah, it's really unfortunate.

06:27.760 --> 06:31.440
I actually have a bunch of Pine 64s and I'm a little disappointed with how poorly supported

06:31.440 --> 06:34.480
that CPU is, or the SoC that is.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.840
How is the GPU?

06:37.840 --> 06:40.200
The GPU is non-existent in open source.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.800
You have to run, I think, their kernel and their U-boot.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.520
That's always a problem with these AMD boards.

06:46.520 --> 06:47.520
It's not AMD.

06:47.520 --> 06:48.520
It's all winter.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.520
It's all winter.

06:49.520 --> 06:50.520
Sorry.

06:50.520 --> 06:51.520
Yeah.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.520
ARM, I think.

06:52.520 --> 06:56.360
The problem is that the GPU often is not well supported only for Android, but not for the

06:56.360 --> 06:57.360
Linux kernel.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.560
Well, but you do have the standouts like the Raspberry Pi where everything is open now.

07:01.560 --> 07:07.000
That is one of the advantages of using something like a Raspberry Pi over a Pine 64.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.680
But you remember the first versions of the Raspberry Pi, how bad the GPU was supported.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.320
Oh, yeah.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.800
Oh, yeah.

07:17.800 --> 07:18.800
What was that?

07:18.800 --> 07:21.800
Are you talking to me?

07:21.800 --> 07:24.080
Hold on.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.440
I think Noah got dropped out of the on-air room.

07:26.440 --> 07:27.440
Oh, no.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.080
We've got production problems.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.080
All right.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.080
That's fine.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.080
I'll be right back.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.080
There we go.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.080
Okay.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.080
Well, yeah.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.800
I think they don't know that I'm me.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.800
I think that's the problem.

07:37.800 --> 07:43.600
I think what happened was because I just basically smashed my face into the keyboard when I was

07:43.600 --> 07:44.600
coming up with my name.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.680
And then additionally, because I'm connected to you via Skype, I'm not connected to you

07:47.680 --> 07:50.960
via the Mumble Room.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.880
I think I've confused the Mumble admins.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.360
That's what makes this show very special.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.360
Exactly.

07:58.360 --> 07:59.360
Okay.

07:59.360 --> 08:02.720
So, following up then, we are on to our next story.

08:02.720 --> 08:10.040
OpenELEC 8.0 Linux OS officially out with Raspberry Pi Zero support and Kodi 17.1.

08:10.040 --> 08:14.040
It's based on the latest Kodi 17.1 Krypton open source and cross-platform media center

08:14.040 --> 08:15.040
software.

08:15.040 --> 08:18.600
OpenELEC 8 is here with a lot of updated internals as well as support for new platforms such

08:18.600 --> 08:23.440
as the recently launched Raspberry Pi Zero W single board computer, the Witek Hub, and

08:23.440 --> 08:24.440
the Witek Play 2.

08:24.440 --> 08:28.920
I'm not familiar with those two, but they say Witek Play 2 brings endless entertainment

08:28.920 --> 08:29.920
to your living room.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.720
Enjoy the latest movies and series in 4K UHD.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.620
So it sounds like they've got some new devices.

08:34.620 --> 08:39.960
Other new stuff includes Linux 4.9 kernel, numerous updated components along with new

08:39.960 --> 08:43.760
XOR system D. So they've bumped provisions on a lot of the system software, including

08:43.760 --> 08:47.340
FFmpeg, which I imagine will be at least somewhat important.

08:47.340 --> 08:52.560
Plus there's no longer going to support iSCSI along with NFS.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.480
And they also no longer support HFS or HFS plus file systems.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.200
Hey, I can understand that as well.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.640
Lerk, Linux infrared remote control support, got removed from OpenELEC 8 as well.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.360
So if you guys are using that, watch out.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.360
That's a big change.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.520
They say it was mostly used only for older IR hardware.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.240
So hopefully that doesn't bite anyone.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.320
I've tried OpenELEC a little bit myself.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.320
I liked it.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.420
It was fun.

09:16.420 --> 09:17.420
It was neat.

09:17.420 --> 09:18.420
It was easy to set up.

09:18.420 --> 09:23.840
But for my needs, at least on the device that I was using, it was a little bit easier for

09:23.840 --> 09:28.280
me to just install Kodi on top of an existing platform where I had a little more control

09:28.280 --> 09:29.720
and a little more familiarity.

09:29.720 --> 09:33.480
But I could see this being a huge win for people who just, you know, they're not super

09:33.480 --> 09:37.240
experienced with Linux, or they just want to get up and go and have this going and just

09:37.240 --> 09:40.440
have it work in a consistent way.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.440
What do you use?

09:41.440 --> 09:44.280
You're talking about how you use offline media, Noah.

09:44.280 --> 09:47.640
Do you have any Kodi in your life or is it all different things?

09:47.640 --> 09:51.680
Yeah, so actually, I had a really rough start with OpenELEC.

09:51.680 --> 09:57.160
Basically, we went to review the latest version of Kodi on the Linux Action Show, and I was

09:57.160 --> 10:02.400
under the impression that Kodi was an appliance that you installed on your computer and then

10:02.400 --> 10:04.000
you could turn your computer into a media center, right?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
That's not what it is.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.080
It's an application, and I wasn't aware of that.

10:07.080 --> 10:10.960
And in my ignorance, we go on the air, we start talking about this, and I start talking

10:10.960 --> 10:14.600
about how there's no utility to configure the network.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.640
I always have to get out of Kodi to go manage my network interface and how silly that is

10:18.640 --> 10:21.960
and how that would never work in an actual media environment.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.880
All these people in the chat room are going, use OpenELEC, use OpenELEC.

10:24.880 --> 10:25.880
Have you heard of OpenELEC?

10:25.880 --> 10:26.880
Try OpenELEC.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.760
You don't know what you're talking about.

10:29.760 --> 10:34.480
That was my first clue that the chat room is always smarter than you are.

10:34.480 --> 10:37.560
The chat room is telling you something, you need to listen to them.

10:37.560 --> 10:41.720
This is before I learned that lesson, so I learned it in a very hard way.

10:41.720 --> 10:46.120
I get off the air and I go, okay, what is this OpenELEC thing they're talking about?

10:46.120 --> 10:51.240
That's the appliance thing that turns Kodi the application into an appliance.

10:51.240 --> 10:54.480
And so then I was like, oh yeah, that was a huge embarrassing thing I did on the air,

10:54.480 --> 10:55.560
so I didn't really want to play with it.

10:55.560 --> 11:00.400
And after I got over that, then I actually built my first OpenELEC box, and it was incredible

11:00.400 --> 11:02.240
everything I wanted it to do.

11:02.240 --> 11:06.160
And I started slowly deciding that this could replace my current media player, which is

11:06.160 --> 11:07.160
the Western Digital TV Live.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.820
I mentioned that numerous times, I'm a big fan of them.

11:09.820 --> 11:15.720
And what I found was the fall through with me anyway, was I have these universal remotes

11:15.720 --> 11:19.320
that communicate RF, and they tie into all the home automation stuff, and the way they

11:19.320 --> 11:21.280
do that was with little IR blasters.

11:21.280 --> 11:25.960
And so I needed to be able to put the IR blasters on the OpenELEC box, and so I didn't have

11:25.960 --> 11:27.480
an IR receiver.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.800
So I bought one, but it was like that was an additional USB port, it just got to be

11:30.800 --> 11:31.800
a pain.

11:31.800 --> 11:38.480
So I eventually wound up with a box that runs Kodi, but it is the Android-based boxes called,

11:38.480 --> 11:40.320
I believe it's a Matrix.

11:40.320 --> 11:44.440
And we've done a review on it on the Linux Action Show, and you can find notes to it.

11:44.440 --> 11:49.160
But I have one of my OpenELEC boxes left, and that's downstairs in my lab.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.360
That's what I watch media on downstairs, so there's definitely Kodi in my life.

11:52.360 --> 11:56.520
I am slowly transitioning the Western Digital TV Lives over to those Matrix boxes because

11:56.520 --> 12:02.760
they run Android with Kodi, and that runs all of my local ISO media just fine, and all

12:02.760 --> 12:06.320
the stuff I download on YouTube deal runs all of that just fine.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.320
Nice.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.320
That's awesome.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.960
Yeah, see, that seems exactly like what it was useful for.

12:10.960 --> 12:15.240
In my case, I was kind of bundling a box together that had, it was going to perform more than

12:15.240 --> 12:20.040
one function there, so after trying it out, it was just a little bit too much of a pain

12:20.040 --> 12:21.920
to get other software installed.

12:21.920 --> 12:25.960
So I ended up going with Bantu Mate, which worked really nicely, and then a couple little,

12:25.960 --> 12:29.320
you know, like a system B thing to start Kodi.

12:29.320 --> 12:34.680
But I think you're right, though, that like if you need it to be an appliance or, you

12:34.680 --> 12:38.240
know, something that can be standalone, something that a user can interact with in a consistent

12:38.240 --> 12:41.200
way, you really do want something like OpenELEC.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.200
Exactly.

12:42.200 --> 12:47.120
Mumbo Room, do you guys have any thoughts on this, anyone using it or anyone not using

12:47.120 --> 12:48.120
it?

12:48.120 --> 12:54.360
I'm not using it, and to be honest, I always get surprised that there's so many people

12:54.360 --> 12:58.880
interested in media centers because I really don't see them useful.

12:58.880 --> 12:59.880
They're need anymore, really.

12:59.880 --> 13:00.880
Okay, hold on.

13:00.880 --> 13:01.880
Hold on.

13:01.880 --> 13:02.880
Hold on.

13:02.880 --> 13:03.880
Let's talk about it.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.680
Let's talk about that for a second.

13:05.680 --> 13:12.200
Are you a single male that is living either by yourself or your entertainment is controlled

13:12.200 --> 13:14.160
solely by you?

13:14.160 --> 13:22.400
That's not what I mean, because I have other people living with me, non-technical people,

13:22.400 --> 13:27.840
so I can see the appeal to them, but again, I guess maybe it's also because of the discrepancy

13:27.840 --> 13:33.200
in my country, like what the media services also come with the TV cable provider, tend

13:33.200 --> 13:37.480
to be already pre-immersive and combined with all of the rest of your network.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.840
Nobody really feels the need of, you know, I'm going to actually make this extra box

13:40.840 --> 13:41.840
in here.

13:41.840 --> 13:42.840
I think we should.

13:42.840 --> 13:43.840
I think we should break that down.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.040
You usually have that box out.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.960
I feel like we need to break this down a little bit.

13:47.960 --> 13:51.580
So you're saying that you don't see the need for a media center because the cable company

13:51.580 --> 13:52.580
is providing it to you.

13:52.580 --> 13:54.680
Is that, am I understanding that correctly?

13:54.680 --> 14:01.120
Well, I'm saying that along, like having actually the need of an extra media center or want

14:01.120 --> 14:06.040
something that will be providing extra features, like these extra features don't seem anybody

14:06.040 --> 14:07.920
really asking for them.

14:07.920 --> 14:13.120
I'm saying personally, I always get impressed and surprised at the quantity of people interested

14:13.120 --> 14:14.120
on the topic personally.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.120
Well, let me ask you this.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.120
Do you own movies?

14:16.120 --> 14:17.120
Yes.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.120
How do you play them?

14:18.120 --> 14:30.120
Well, do you already have either your PlayStation or you have your DVD?

14:30.120 --> 14:38.360
If you have a media center, this is the other thing that I was saying, the box, the default

14:38.360 --> 14:43.800
box, just to access your channels connects to your home network and can access any computer

14:43.800 --> 14:49.760
as long as you basically enable the permission on the computer, basically one click away

14:49.760 --> 14:53.120
and all of a sudden your hard drive is displayed in that box.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.120
Right.

14:54.120 --> 14:58.040
Though I guess my point is that first of all, I need a box that can play the media that

14:58.040 --> 15:00.720
is stored on my hard drive one click away.

15:00.720 --> 15:06.480
But more importantly, that the optical media thing works if you have five, 10, 20, 50,

15:06.480 --> 15:07.960
maybe a hundred movies.

15:07.960 --> 15:12.960
But I have something like 7,000 DVDs in my collection.

15:12.960 --> 15:19.160
Do you know what a task it would be just to find a given movie, let alone organize and

15:19.160 --> 15:23.080
store all of those movies if I had to physically store them all here at the house and have

15:23.080 --> 15:24.640
them available so that I can watch them?

15:24.640 --> 15:30.480
I mean, at some point it becomes a scale factor and it just becomes untenable, right?

15:30.480 --> 15:34.240
My NAS, I have something like 64 terabytes of storage on my NAS.

15:34.240 --> 15:39.000
My NAS, I can store as many movies as I want and I never really have to think about it

15:39.000 --> 15:42.440
or worry about it because I just click on it, they're all alphabetized.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.440
Sure.

15:43.440 --> 15:47.320
Realistically, how many people have 7,000 movies though too?

15:47.320 --> 15:53.400
Well, I don't know exactly and that's a combination that's movies and then TV shows too, right?

15:53.400 --> 15:59.000
Because every TV show is, one season is 24 different video files.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.960
I shouldn't say movies, I should say video files.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.680
But one season can be up to 24 video files in the case of 24, right?

16:04.680 --> 16:05.680
And then there's eight seasons.

16:05.680 --> 16:06.680
So that's how many-

16:06.680 --> 16:07.680
Multiple seasons.

16:07.680 --> 16:08.680
Yeah, sure.

16:08.680 --> 16:09.680
Right.

16:09.680 --> 16:13.400
So I mean, I'm just saying that the media center to me, it makes a lot of sense if you

16:13.400 --> 16:14.880
want to organize local media.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.800
Now I could see the argument if you said, I don't care about local media, I'm just going

16:17.800 --> 16:20.640
to stream everything or I'm going to do everything off my cable provider.

16:20.640 --> 16:24.640
Okay, very good, but then we're relying on services, right?

16:24.640 --> 16:29.580
And oftentimes not only relying on services, we are also having to pay for those services.

16:29.580 --> 16:34.160
And so I don't know what it's like over in your part of the world, but over here, cable

16:34.160 --> 16:37.400
starts at like $50 a month and then it goes up from there.

16:37.400 --> 16:42.240
And my sister, I think her cable package is like $300 by the time she gets done adding

16:42.240 --> 16:43.800
all this stuff, she needs a month.

16:43.800 --> 16:44.800
Yeah.

16:44.800 --> 16:45.800
Well, it's great.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.200
And she has access to like everything under the sun, but that's a reoccurring cost.

16:48.200 --> 16:53.640
You know how many, you know how much content I can purchase with $3,000 a year, well, really

16:53.640 --> 16:54.640
$3,600 a year.

16:54.640 --> 17:00.520
I mean, that's a lot of content if you start looking, if you start doing the math.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.520
Yeah, that's true.

17:01.520 --> 17:09.800
So the price might be actually a great point here because we started like 20 euros.

17:09.800 --> 17:14.940
It's basically not 22 bucks a month and you have the channels and you have the recording

17:14.940 --> 17:17.360
and you have the streaming and all of that is included.

17:17.360 --> 17:19.920
You have all that as long as you continue to pay the ransom fee.

17:19.920 --> 17:20.920
Right.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.400
I think it comes down to people's priorities.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.400
Well, it's not really a ransom fee.

17:23.400 --> 17:27.320
By the way, it's not a ransom fee because you actually own the box that it's in your

17:27.320 --> 17:28.720
home and that hard drive.

17:28.720 --> 17:33.520
So if you'd low load to have it locally, it's locally available even if you close the service.

17:33.520 --> 17:36.280
So if I cancel the service, I still have access to that content?

17:36.280 --> 17:37.280
Yes.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.120
See, that's a big difference.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.120
You download it to your box.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.120
Right.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.560
That's a big difference in the way it works here in the U.S. Here in the U.S. if you pay

17:43.560 --> 17:48.320
like you use like the hopper and direct TV, if you cancel the service, all of that prerecorded

17:48.320 --> 17:49.320
content is gone.

17:49.320 --> 17:55.880
In fact, and this is a big thing for cloud connected Chris, if he were to get a direct

17:55.880 --> 18:01.020
TV subscription and he wants to take it in his RV, he has to leave that direct TV box

18:01.020 --> 18:04.840
powered up because if he doesn't have access to the direct TV satellites, he can't even

18:04.840 --> 18:08.620
watch his prerecorded content even if the subscription is active because it has to verify

18:08.620 --> 18:12.160
that before you can play, you know, prerecorded content.

18:12.160 --> 18:16.280
So it may be somewhat different from the way it works here in the U.S. That may be partly

18:16.280 --> 18:18.080
why we have such different beliefs.

18:18.080 --> 18:21.840
Yeah, I think that sounds about right.

18:21.840 --> 18:26.080
So Ryan, you wanted to talk a little bit about your use case for Kodi.

18:26.080 --> 18:33.000
Yeah, my wife and I use a Kodi box and we also have RetroPie installed on it.

18:33.000 --> 18:39.960
And I think that for the longest time, we had a Plex server and we're using our TV's

18:39.960 --> 18:45.480
built in app in order to connect to it because I had a built in Plex app.

18:45.480 --> 18:54.280
But media playback for really, really big content like 4K, you know, content was not

18:54.280 --> 18:59.340
the best and that was partly because of the server was not the newest.

18:59.340 --> 19:09.160
So we just got a new, I work at System76, we got a Meerkat with, you know, an i5 and

19:09.160 --> 19:10.960
connected it to our television.

19:10.960 --> 19:15.840
Now we can do 4K playback no problem.

19:15.840 --> 19:21.040
And we just moved all of our content locally to that box.

19:21.040 --> 19:28.440
And she really likes it because we have a couple of controllers, Super Nintendo like

19:28.440 --> 19:36.120
USB controllers, and she likes to pop open RetroPie, which like Kodi, you know, that's

19:36.120 --> 19:43.120
local content, you know, that you own on the box and play games on it.

19:43.120 --> 19:50.160
But she's not non-technical but as a less technical user loves Kodi and it didn't take

19:50.160 --> 19:57.440
any time at all to, you know, for her to get started in using it.

19:57.440 --> 20:05.960
And we moved all, like Noah, not 7000 videos, but we moved a lot of content there.

20:05.960 --> 20:11.160
And it's nice to have it local because during peak hours here, you know, the internet streaming

20:11.160 --> 20:16.760
can sometimes get really crappy, especially with high DPI or high, you're really high

20:16.760 --> 20:18.260
def media.

20:18.260 --> 20:24.000
But if it's just local on your box, you don't have to worry about, you know, what your neighbor's

20:24.000 --> 20:27.960
pulling down, you know, and how stressed the pipe is.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.080
Yeah, that's a good point.

20:31.080 --> 20:34.280
Not everyone has, especially if you live in a place where you don't always have good internet

20:34.280 --> 20:37.040
connectivity or you just, you know, you share an apartment building with a bunch of other

20:37.040 --> 20:42.200
nerds who want to use internet all the time, it can give you a lot of flexibility.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.680
Okay, so Mr. Tennell, you also wanted to chime in here.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.680
I know you're...

20:45.680 --> 20:51.120
Yeah, I wanted to talk about something else, but this topic kind of also wanted to address

20:51.120 --> 20:56.400
the, like Kodi's not just local though, like, yeah, local, the Kodi is great because you

20:56.400 --> 21:01.280
can do both and that you can do local if you want to, which is, you know, all the benefits

21:01.280 --> 21:05.000
of using that, but it's not like you're required to do local media.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.720
You can watch YouTube videos.

21:06.720 --> 21:13.800
You can watch live streams of ESPN, all kinds of stuff on Kodi, and there's even now a plug-in

21:13.800 --> 21:14.800
being made for Netflix.

21:14.800 --> 21:15.800
Right?

21:15.800 --> 21:16.800
That's a good point.

21:16.800 --> 21:22.000
Also, you have the ability to use most of the streaming stuff you want, well, soon,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.680
with Netflix, but it's not like...

21:24.680 --> 21:29.240
It's an interface where you can have both and it's more of a convenience interface and

21:29.240 --> 21:35.360
also you can deploy it on, like, a TV for your family members or maybe in, like, a lobby

21:35.360 --> 21:37.520
of a business or something.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.700
That's a good point.

21:38.700 --> 21:39.960
There are a couple of apps on there.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.280
I just wanted to make a point.

21:41.280 --> 21:47.240
There are a couple of plug-ins that are better on Kodi than their apps on, you know, the

21:47.240 --> 21:55.820
Samsung Smart TV, which is what I switched to recently, and the interface is better,

21:55.820 --> 22:01.000
the ease of use is easier, and there are some apps that exist on Kodi that simply don't

22:01.000 --> 22:03.040
exist on that platform.

22:03.040 --> 22:04.560
So I think everyone...

22:04.560 --> 22:09.560
I've made myself pretty clear numerous times what I think of, you know, local content versus

22:09.560 --> 22:15.360
streaming content, but just for the purpose of an exercise, I'll take Devil's Advocate

22:15.360 --> 22:17.800
and I'll play the other side here for a moment.

22:17.800 --> 22:21.760
Why Kodi over just buying a Roku or an Amazon Fire Stick?

22:21.760 --> 22:24.880
I mean, why would I use Kodi if I'm going to stream everything?

22:24.880 --> 22:28.520
Because here's the thing, the streaming apps, the YouTube and Netflix and stuff, that stuff

22:28.520 --> 22:30.680
is amazing on those things.

22:30.680 --> 22:34.080
In fact, spending time with Chris in the RV, I mean, that's his primary source of entertainment

22:34.080 --> 22:36.680
is the NVIDIA Shield with a YouTube app.

22:36.680 --> 22:42.120
Well, I mean, my opinion, the reason why is not necessarily...

22:42.120 --> 22:48.000
If your sole purpose is to only ever stream, Roku is fine, but Kodi is great because you

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
can do both.

22:49.000 --> 22:54.040
Like, if someone wants to do local as their primary, like yourself, but then occasionally

22:54.040 --> 22:57.080
maybe Netflix, Kodi's perfect.

22:57.080 --> 23:01.880
Like you have all the benefits that you want for both sides without having to worry about,

23:01.880 --> 23:05.540
you know, does this device have a specific channel?

23:05.540 --> 23:09.040
Like Roku, you're only able to watch certain things based on whether someone has made a

23:09.040 --> 23:10.040
channel for it.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.040
That makes sense.

23:11.040 --> 23:16.860
Kits and Kitty is telling me in the chat room that DirecTV has actually updated their policies

23:16.860 --> 23:22.040
for playing local content and they now have specific provisions for people that are in

23:22.040 --> 23:23.040
RVs.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.040
Kits and Kitty.

23:24.040 --> 23:27.480
I used to work for the parent company of DirecTV.

23:27.480 --> 23:32.480
So you actually need special equipment and special flags on your account to do this.

23:32.480 --> 23:34.660
This has kind of always been the case.

23:34.660 --> 23:40.720
You can't really pack up your equipment, put it on your RV and then go because there's

23:40.720 --> 23:48.240
location-based sensors inside the satellite equipment to prevent pirating and satellite

23:48.240 --> 23:49.240
theft.

23:49.240 --> 23:50.240
Fair enough.

23:50.240 --> 23:54.160
And I should point out, Chris does not have DirecTV.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.160
He does.

23:55.160 --> 23:58.120
I mean, as an independent content creator, that would be kind of weird, right?

23:58.120 --> 24:04.520
But just people like him in his position that are in RVs, that is a popular thing.

24:04.520 --> 24:08.560
Nomadic fanatic, somebody who both Chris and I follow, he went through that about.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.480
So I should make that clarification.

24:10.480 --> 24:13.860
He doesn't have it as just using him as an example as somebody who may be interested

24:13.860 --> 24:14.860
in it.

24:14.860 --> 24:18.940
And that's very interesting, Kits and Kitty, that they've actually updated that.

24:18.940 --> 24:20.840
It's actually not something that was updated.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.520
It's something that's kind of always been there.

24:23.520 --> 24:29.840
It's just a lot of people haven't had the need for it and everything.

24:29.840 --> 24:37.520
So one more thing, regarding the OpenELEC news, I would suggest people take out LibreELEC

24:37.520 --> 24:43.080
instead of OpenELEC, mainly because LibreELEC is a forked version of OpenELEC.

24:43.080 --> 24:49.000
There was basically, like last year, they had a falling out between a lot of the developers

24:49.000 --> 24:52.160
on OpenELEC, so they branched out and made their own.

24:52.160 --> 24:56.800
And I would say that the reason why you would look at it is because they are much more up

24:56.800 --> 25:02.360
to date with Kodi and they're basically on the same line of when Kodi updates, LibreELEC

25:02.360 --> 25:03.420
updates.

25:03.420 --> 25:11.960
So you'll see that version 8.0, first version of Kodi 17 being available in OpenELEC was

25:11.960 --> 25:13.920
released a couple of days ago.

25:13.920 --> 25:20.520
The first version of LibreELEC with version 17 of Kodi was a month and a half ago.

25:20.520 --> 25:25.520
They are way more up to date and way more attentive to everything.

25:25.520 --> 25:32.860
And you could actually, I've been using the beta of Krypton or Kodi 17 for months now

25:32.860 --> 25:37.800
thanks to LibreELEC's consistently updating through the beta program so you can actually

25:37.800 --> 25:39.320
just keep trying it the whole time.

25:39.320 --> 25:44.120
There's a new beta for Kodi, there's a new beta for LibreELEC.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.480
What are you using it on?

25:46.480 --> 25:48.680
What hardware are you using LibreELEC on?

25:48.680 --> 25:56.720
I tried to install OpenELEC on the Meerkat and it didn't really like it and I never troubleshot

25:56.720 --> 26:01.940
it through enough to figure out why it wouldn't install, but it wasn't just a straightforward

26:01.940 --> 26:03.960
install and run.

26:03.960 --> 26:11.800
I've used it on a Pi, I've used it on a laptop, and I've used it on like a spare desktop computer.

26:11.800 --> 26:16.960
Okay, so that seems like a perfect opportunity to segue into our next topic.

26:16.960 --> 26:20.520
If you do have kind of trouble installing these things, here's an update from one of

26:20.520 --> 26:25.120
our favorite projects, which is Snaps.

26:25.120 --> 26:30.600
So Snaps support has landed in Fedora 24, 25, and 26.

26:30.600 --> 26:35.480
David Callier on the Ubuntu blog writes, as part of our mission to get Snaps running everywhere,

26:35.480 --> 26:39.600
we are pleased to announce that support for Snaps has now officially landed in Fedora,

26:39.600 --> 26:41.900
starting with Fedora 24 and up.

26:41.900 --> 26:46.960
Big thanks to Neil Gompa, who has been instrumental in landing SnapD packages in the Fedora archive.

26:46.960 --> 26:50.800
So then they kind of go through some steps, you know, sudo dnf install SnapD, which is

26:50.800 --> 26:51.800
kind of fun just to see.

26:51.800 --> 26:58.760
They've got a little provisos here and there for if you're running on Fedora 24, but you

26:58.760 --> 27:02.080
know, if you if you're hearing all the Ubuntu news, you're thinking, well, you know, even

27:02.080 --> 27:05.160
with no Ubuntu, maybe I still really like Fedora, this kind of goes a little bit of

27:05.160 --> 27:09.640
the way to bridging the gap between the systems and might make it a little bit easier to install

27:09.640 --> 27:15.760
some of your favorite software that might not be in the Fedora repos.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.760
What do you guys think?

27:16.760 --> 27:18.840
Is this something that you guys would actually use?

27:18.840 --> 27:22.040
Or is it just a novelty?

27:22.040 --> 27:23.040
Use Fedora.

27:23.040 --> 27:29.420
Well, as someone who was, to be honest, really against the whole idea of these containerizing

27:29.420 --> 27:33.880
of apps, Snap has gotten really great.

27:33.880 --> 27:37.280
And it just works TM a lot.

27:37.280 --> 27:42.720
So this as far as I'm concerned, I'm really looking forward to it being available there

27:42.720 --> 27:47.360
because you know, a lot of people go and say, oh, you know, snap, it's just a new Ubuntu

27:47.360 --> 27:48.360
thing.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.680
It's only really works there.

27:49.680 --> 27:53.480
So as it actually moves out and people like see it, I think that it's going to have a

27:53.480 --> 27:59.880
lot stronger standing, especially dealing with, you know, its competitors.

27:59.880 --> 28:05.220
Snaps are available on a lot of distros now and the only holdout was really Fedora.

28:05.220 --> 28:08.560
So now that it's on there, it's fantastic.

28:08.560 --> 28:12.400
I've been using snaps for quite a lot and I think snaps are going to be so far, they

28:12.400 --> 28:16.400
seem to be the most potential against the other ones.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.400
Yeah.

28:17.400 --> 28:24.640
I wanted to point out I did some snap packaging of a couple of apps and I noticed that they

28:24.640 --> 28:33.960
actually, the desktop apps I packaged, respect my desktop settings like themes and so on

28:33.960 --> 28:41.200
more than Flatpak, even though I'm using Ubuntu Gnome now.

28:41.200 --> 28:51.120
So they just like Wizard pointed out, they just work a lot of the times and that's really,

28:51.120 --> 28:55.320
you don't want to think about how something is packaged when you use it, you just want

28:55.320 --> 28:56.320
to use it.

28:56.320 --> 28:57.320
Right.

28:57.320 --> 28:58.320
Yeah.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.520
There's definitely a lot of places where you're just like, okay, I need to get this thing

28:59.520 --> 29:00.520
done.

29:00.520 --> 29:01.520
Let me install it.

29:01.520 --> 29:02.520
How can I install it?

29:02.520 --> 29:03.520
Oh no, library problems.

29:03.520 --> 29:06.320
And if the snap works, then you're like, okay, great, now it works.

29:06.320 --> 29:11.040
The Flatpaks don't have support for themes and fonts because they just don't have any

29:11.040 --> 29:12.840
connections to the desktop.

29:12.840 --> 29:19.960
Whereas the snaps have a specific snap app desktop package where it's specifically for

29:19.960 --> 29:24.840
if you include that as a dependency of your snap, it will be able to detect whatever settings

29:24.840 --> 29:25.840
you have.

29:25.840 --> 29:26.840
Naive.

29:26.840 --> 29:32.420
Also, I've been working on doing snaps and stuff and I've been working on all of it,

29:32.420 --> 29:39.120
but I noticed one of my favorite things about snap is that I can have my project on GitHub

29:39.120 --> 29:43.640
and then I can just mirror everything I do onto Launchpad and the Launchpad will automatically

29:43.640 --> 29:47.880
make a snap every time I change something in my commits.

29:47.880 --> 29:52.520
Kits and Kitty brings up an interesting point and I have asked this question before.

29:52.520 --> 29:56.480
Kits and Kitty, do you want to ask your question about the difference between dev, rpm, and

29:56.480 --> 29:57.480
snaps?

29:57.480 --> 29:58.480
Yeah.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.840
I mean, we already have a universal package format.

30:00.840 --> 30:06.000
It's called rpm, dev, tar, gz, Flatpak, app image.

30:06.000 --> 30:12.400
I mean, every one of these try to, at some point, be the universal standard and it's

30:12.400 --> 30:14.720
just one more thing that we have to support.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.000
Okay, so that's the question.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.880
Michael, do you want to see, can you address that for us?

30:18.880 --> 30:21.600
RPMs and devs have never been universal.

30:21.600 --> 30:26.360
They're not only very specific to distros, they're specific to distro versions.

30:26.360 --> 30:33.640
And when you say that we already had Flatpaks and app images, yes, we had app images first.

30:33.640 --> 30:38.720
Flatpaks are actually older or they were made after snaps.

30:38.720 --> 30:43.720
Snaps were beat Flatpaks by like three weeks or something.

30:43.720 --> 30:49.360
There isn't actually a universal app format yet and all of the devs and RPMs are not,

30:49.360 --> 30:51.120
that's not even what they're meant to be doing.

30:51.120 --> 30:56.020
Now what do you prefer, Michael, from the standpoint of a universal package?

30:56.020 --> 30:57.240
Do you think Flatpaks are better?

30:57.240 --> 30:58.560
Do you think snaps are better?

30:58.560 --> 31:02.000
And then my second part of that question is, regardless of what you think is technically

31:02.000 --> 31:05.440
superior, which one do you think we're going to wind up on?

31:05.440 --> 31:08.940
I think technically superior is snaps.

31:08.940 --> 31:14.180
But I think as far as usability wise now, app images are much more usable because they're

31:14.180 --> 31:18.360
easily accessible, whereas snaps still have work to do.

31:18.360 --> 31:22.360
So like I think in the long run, snaps are going to win.

31:22.360 --> 31:28.680
But I think app images are going to get a large chunk really early because you can just

31:28.680 --> 31:31.040
create an app image right now and run it.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.040
That makes a lot of sense.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.040
Wes, what do you think?

31:33.040 --> 31:36.040
Yeah, you know, I'm definitely interested in it.

31:36.040 --> 31:43.320
I've played a lot more with things like Docker in this space for server side apps.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.320
That's one thing.

31:44.320 --> 31:49.440
But I was looking, you know, deploying software is an interesting problem.

31:49.440 --> 31:53.100
I think there's different angles from the server side and the desktop side.

31:53.100 --> 31:59.120
And that's one thing like I really like kind of the things that snap, some of the abstractions

31:59.120 --> 32:00.120
that they're using.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.120
I've really thought about these things.

32:01.120 --> 32:05.880
And whether or not you want the sandboxing or not, the way that they've kind of described

32:05.880 --> 32:09.160
here's the ways that you can connect their like ports and sockets, what do they call

32:09.160 --> 32:10.160
it?

32:10.160 --> 32:11.160
Something like that.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.560
I think it makes it very useful.

32:13.560 --> 32:18.600
And I'm excited for a world where I'm hopeful that some of these splits can make it a little

32:18.600 --> 32:23.200
bit easier where we can focus like our package, the package management standards that we have

32:23.200 --> 32:28.300
now that work really well with open source software, software or things that work really

32:28.300 --> 32:29.960
well as libraries or system things.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.120
And I'm really hopeful that that will let us focus there.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.120
I completely agree.

32:33.120 --> 32:37.200
And one of the things is being able to test all of this stuff on various distros.

32:37.200 --> 32:40.920
And you know, a great way to do that is if you have access to simultaneous machines,

32:40.920 --> 32:41.960
you can kind of compare.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.160
This is how this works on Ubuntu.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.480
This is how this works on CentOS.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.400
Are you following me?

32:46.400 --> 32:48.480
That's kind of that really starts to bring it home.

32:48.480 --> 32:51.720
And so one of the things that's been really helpful to me and I don't know about you Wes

32:51.720 --> 32:53.560
is, you know, DigitalOcean.

32:53.560 --> 32:58.200
That's a great way where I can spin up four or five different servers running four or

32:58.200 --> 33:02.400
five different distros and I can see, okay, Snaps works really well on Ubuntu.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.400
Okay.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.400
But does it work on CentOS?

33:04.400 --> 33:05.400
Yeah.

33:05.400 --> 33:06.400
We can get it to work.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.400
We just have to, you know, tweak this or tweak that.

33:07.400 --> 33:08.400
Okay.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.400
How about Flatback?

33:09.400 --> 33:10.400
Does that work on this distro or that distro?

33:10.400 --> 33:11.400
Have you found that to be the case, Wes?

33:11.400 --> 33:12.400
Oh yeah.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.400
No, I think, I think that's exactly the case.

33:13.400 --> 33:17.280
It makes it so, DigitalOcean just makes it so easy to get started.

33:17.280 --> 33:18.280
Right?

33:18.280 --> 33:21.760
I mean, you just, you just go over to DigitalOcean.com, you use our promo code D-O unplugged.

33:21.760 --> 33:23.820
That gets you a $10 credit.

33:23.820 --> 33:28.860
And when you find out that it starts at $5 a month, yeah, $5 a month, you can spin up

33:28.860 --> 33:32.720
one of these awesome droplets in under 55 seconds and then bam, you just have a throwaway

33:32.720 --> 33:36.640
disposable system, whatever Linux, pretty much whatever Linux system you want.

33:36.640 --> 33:41.280
They've got all the best ones and because it's a real KVM hypervisor, you can install

33:41.280 --> 33:42.280
whatever Linux you want.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.440
There's some instructions.

33:43.440 --> 33:46.680
It'll probably take your Linux game to the next level, but that's the thing, DigitalOcean,

33:46.680 --> 33:47.680
that's what they want.

33:47.680 --> 33:48.680
They support that.

33:48.680 --> 33:49.680
So just get started.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.000
You get a $10 credit.

33:51.000 --> 33:57.000
If you start with the $5 plan, you get like 512 MB of RAM, 20 gigs of SSD drive, a CPU

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
and a terabyte of transfer.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.200
One of the things I love about DigitalOcean, it's that transfer.

34:02.200 --> 34:06.720
They really make sure that you have the bandwidth and the networking capability that you need.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.080
And that is not true of all cloud providers.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.220
So it makes it like a go-to for me.

34:10.220 --> 34:12.520
Like there's a lot of times, you know, we were talking earlier about like when you have

34:12.520 --> 34:15.080
bandwidth problems or connection problems.

34:15.080 --> 34:18.600
I've had to talk with some servers like in Europe, say, and a lot of like the residential

34:18.600 --> 34:19.600
ISPs.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.800
Sure, you know, you got good connectivity, you want to go talk to a server in California,

34:22.800 --> 34:23.800
fine.

34:23.800 --> 34:27.200
But they don't always have the best connections across the Atlantic or to Europe.

34:27.200 --> 34:28.700
DigitalOcean has great peering.

34:28.700 --> 34:29.880
They have great networks.

34:29.880 --> 34:33.920
So I'll just proxy some of my connections through DigitalOcean and they'll like instantly

34:33.920 --> 34:37.800
be faster, even though I'm adding another hop to the path.

34:37.800 --> 34:38.880
It's just better.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.780
So some other things you might really like about DigitalOcean, they have data center

34:41.780 --> 34:43.520
locations all over the world.

34:43.520 --> 34:48.000
New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, Frankfurt, these are all

34:48.000 --> 34:52.040
places one, I'd like to visit and then two, these are great data center locations.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.600
They understand how these work.

34:53.600 --> 35:00.840
They've got great peering, 40 gigabit right into that hypervisor and, and they have really

35:00.840 --> 35:03.700
ramped up their game in terms of competing with some of their competitors.

35:03.700 --> 35:07.840
They've got monitoring, they've got load balancing, they've got private networking.

35:07.840 --> 35:12.720
If you have droplets in the same data center, DigitalOcean has just been killing it and

35:12.720 --> 35:14.660
now is like the best time to go try it.

35:14.660 --> 35:19.240
So just head on over to DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUG, that lets DigitalOcean

35:19.240 --> 35:23.600
know that you appreciate them sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program and then you can come

35:23.600 --> 35:27.400
back next week and tell us about all the awesome things you've been doing with our friends

35:27.400 --> 35:29.400
over at DigitalOcean.

35:29.400 --> 35:37.000
Okay, so after that, DigitalOcean is an awesome platform for getting stuff done.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.880
So I just wanted to kind of like rapid fire, there's still a discussion topic I really

35:39.880 --> 35:43.720
want to get to, but before we get there, I just wanted to highlight a couple projects

35:43.720 --> 35:47.040
I saw this week that I thought would be interesting and then I'm just going to run through these

35:47.040 --> 35:48.040
and then we can kind of talk about them.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.360
Noah, I want to get your input.

35:49.360 --> 35:50.360
Absolutely.

35:50.360 --> 35:54.320
First up, it's kind of an older project, it hasn't seen a ton of use, but I thought it

35:54.320 --> 35:55.480
might be interesting.

35:55.480 --> 36:00.220
It's called journal trigger D and it runs a trigger on systems D journal messages.

36:00.220 --> 36:05.920
So it kind of hooks up to the journal, waits for messages, and then you can kind of define

36:05.920 --> 36:06.920
it as a script runner, right?

36:06.920 --> 36:09.120
So you're like, oh, well, when I see this log line, right?

36:09.120 --> 36:12.800
Or maybe, you know, I'm running fail to ban or something elsewhere.

36:12.800 --> 36:16.280
Stop putting things to the journal, something happens, and then this is able to parse it,

36:16.280 --> 36:19.080
you can kind of configure things so that then it will launch whatever program you want.

36:19.080 --> 36:23.320
Maybe that's to send you a text message, or that's to restart a service.

36:23.320 --> 36:24.320
So that's just one thing.

36:24.320 --> 36:27.800
I think system D adds a lot of that nice format, right?

36:27.800 --> 36:31.320
Like the journal does a really good job of capturing input and output to programs.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.620
It does a good job of like, you can express it in JSON if you want.

36:34.620 --> 36:36.820
So if you want to have it machine readable.

36:36.820 --> 36:37.820
So I just thought that was neat.

36:37.820 --> 36:40.600
I wonder if anyone would be would find that useful.

36:40.600 --> 36:45.320
Next up, here is something from Mark Kolich.

36:45.320 --> 36:50.340
He's a software engineer, and he has a nice blog post about how to manually throttle the

36:50.340 --> 36:52.880
bandwidth of a Linux network interface.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.200
So this is something I've run into.

36:54.200 --> 36:58.120
I know at least a couple times at work, I was doing backups or other things that I accidentally

36:58.120 --> 37:02.520
triggered an alarm where, ooh, I'm using like a whole bunch of the traffic through the switch

37:02.520 --> 37:04.540
or something like that.

37:04.540 --> 37:10.120
I was using pipe viewer PV, so it was pretty easy to throttle it that way.

37:10.120 --> 37:14.720
But it made me curious about like, well, you know, what is the best way to do that?

37:14.720 --> 37:18.200
If I want to say that this application can only get this much bandwidth or partition

37:18.200 --> 37:22.240
things or say like, you know, traffic on this port should only use this much.

37:22.240 --> 37:28.840
On Linux, in the new IP route 2 package, there is the TC command, which is traffic control.

37:28.840 --> 37:34.780
But it's very poorly documented by like a lot of things, unfortunately, in that package.

37:34.780 --> 37:36.800
And it's rather confusing to use.

37:36.800 --> 37:41.440
So I thought this was a really good blog post just as an introduction about like, you know,

37:41.440 --> 37:47.660
how you might do that if you need to do traffic shaping, traffic control, anything like that.

37:47.660 --> 37:51.160
This gives you something of a starting point where you can kind of get a grip on this very

37:51.160 --> 37:52.280
complicated topic.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.680
Because once you use it, it works very nicely.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.500
It works very effectively, efficiently.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.160
It's just a little hard to get started with.

37:58.160 --> 37:59.160
And...

37:59.160 --> 38:00.160
I think that...

38:00.160 --> 38:01.160
Oh, go on.

38:01.160 --> 38:02.160
No, that's okay.

38:02.160 --> 38:05.800
I just was going to stop you for a second and just say the interesting thing, and I've

38:05.800 --> 38:09.640
seen this transition in the industry, I'd be curious, because I know you work in industry

38:09.640 --> 38:14.560
as well, to see if you've seen the same thing, and that is that they are trying to bring

38:14.560 --> 38:17.240
together the networking side and the server side.

38:17.240 --> 38:21.240
And I think the rationale behind that is if you train a bunch of people that are system

38:21.240 --> 38:24.700
administrators and know how to administrate the Linux system, and if we can take those

38:24.700 --> 38:29.420
skills and use them to administrate the network side, now as a company, we don't have to employ

38:29.420 --> 38:31.880
system administrators and network engineers.

38:31.880 --> 38:34.280
We can just let the system administrators deal with all this stuff.

38:34.280 --> 38:39.480
Do you kind of see that same trend, and do you see these new tools in Linux going to

38:39.480 --> 38:40.480
that end?

38:40.480 --> 38:41.480
You know, I do.

38:41.480 --> 38:42.480
I think...

38:42.480 --> 38:45.440
I'm not sure that that's exactly where it's going to go, but I do think we've seen a lot

38:45.440 --> 38:50.560
of developments, like Ansible in particular has been targeting switch platforms, router

38:50.560 --> 38:55.320
platforms, because we want to be able to use these same kinds of tools to...

38:55.320 --> 38:59.120
Tools that sys admins already understand for managing the servers to be able to manage

38:59.120 --> 39:00.120
the network hardware.

39:00.120 --> 39:05.520
And in kind of the opposite way, one of the projects I've been following is Cumulus Linux.

39:05.520 --> 39:09.440
I would love to have a Cumulus Linux switch in my house, but there's like really no options

39:09.440 --> 39:11.200
under a grand right now.

39:11.200 --> 39:17.880
But what they do is they use these like Broadcom switch fabrics to do software-defined networking,

39:17.880 --> 39:21.360
but they have implemented basically a kernel module that implements all those standard

39:21.360 --> 39:27.280
Linux IP table stuff, but accelerated with this proprietary Broadcom SDK.

39:27.280 --> 39:32.080
So that lets you use all your standard commands, but on this actual hardware that has full

39:32.080 --> 39:34.320
networking support where you can get real performance.

39:34.320 --> 39:40.640
So I think you're dead on about that, especially in a world where you have these proprietary

39:40.640 --> 39:44.120
networking devices that have different command lines, different configurations, they're all

39:44.120 --> 39:49.400
kind of similar, but all kind of different.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.880
That makes a lot of sense.

39:50.880 --> 39:57.200
Okay, so one more thing I'd like to highlight really quick here is Hashicorp Packer has

39:57.200 --> 39:59.160
hit their 1.0 release.

39:59.160 --> 40:05.200
So Hashicorp is a neat thing, they're the people behind Vagrant and a few other tools

40:05.200 --> 40:09.880
that you might be familiar if you do any sort of development or sysadmin or DevOps, if you

40:09.880 --> 40:10.880
will.

40:10.880 --> 40:14.840
So they're proud to announce that Hashicorp Packer 1.0 has been released.

40:14.840 --> 40:19.040
Packer is a tool for building images for cloud platforms, virtual machines, containers and

40:19.040 --> 40:21.860
more from a single source configuration.

40:21.860 --> 40:24.620
They say that Packer 1.0 is a significant milestone.

40:24.620 --> 40:28.560
It's a powerful and full-featured tool to create cloud images and application packages.

40:28.560 --> 40:33.000
So if you're not familiar with it, that's exactly what it does.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.480
So you can kind of define your configuration, how you want it to look, what distribution

40:36.480 --> 40:41.800
it is, and then it handles all of the details about packing that into the right format.

40:41.800 --> 40:46.440
So whether you want a QCOW image or you want an AMI or you want something that can run

40:46.440 --> 40:50.840
on a DigitalOcean droplet or you just want something that can run on Libvert, it does

40:50.840 --> 40:51.840
it all.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.600
It'll even do bare metal images, that kind of thing.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.840
So I know we've used it at work.

40:55.840 --> 41:00.360
I've seen other projects and companies that use it, and I just thought it'd be good to

41:00.360 --> 41:01.360
mention it.

41:01.360 --> 41:04.920
Noah, do you use anything like this at alt speed to kind of like, you know, if you need

41:04.920 --> 41:08.320
to build a bunch of images before you, you know, pixie-boot them or images to deploy

41:08.320 --> 41:11.740
at customer spaces, do you guys use any tools?

41:11.740 --> 41:12.740
We do use tools.

41:12.740 --> 41:17.800
We've never used that specifically, but what we've done is we actually have a server where

41:17.800 --> 41:23.960
we still use plain old, what's the name of it, Clonzilla, plain old Clonzilla.

41:23.960 --> 41:24.960
And you know, it's great.

41:24.960 --> 41:25.960
Here's what we've done.

41:25.960 --> 41:29.200
We've gotten to a point now where we have a Clonzilla image server where we keep images.

41:29.200 --> 41:34.120
So like when the new Optiplex 3020 comes out, we'll install Ubuntu 16.04 and we'll configure

41:34.120 --> 41:37.920
it and we'll put the, you know, Adobe Reader and the Flash Player and all the junk that

41:37.920 --> 41:40.960
none of us really want on our computers, but we have to have them to make them useful.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.820
Then we make an image of that machine.

41:42.820 --> 41:44.100
We store that on our image server.

41:44.100 --> 41:48.720
And what we've started doing lately is we've started syncing the most commonly used images

41:48.720 --> 41:55.120
down to a small 2.5 inch USB drives, SSD, and we take that into this little backpack

41:55.120 --> 41:58.960
sling that we have along with the USB copy of Clonzilla so that we can go on site to

41:58.960 --> 42:02.400
a customer's premise and say, okay, we need to redo this machine.

42:02.400 --> 42:03.400
Okay.

42:03.400 --> 42:04.400
We'll go ahead and take this USB key.

42:04.400 --> 42:05.400
We'll stick it in.

42:05.400 --> 42:06.400
We plug the USB drive in.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.400
Then we re-image the machine.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.440
That's been absolutely fantastic.

42:08.440 --> 42:13.220
And I'll tell you, you know, you brought up pixie-boot and that just kind of sent, it

42:13.220 --> 42:17.540
just kind of made me, I have PTSD there for a second.

42:17.540 --> 42:21.680
If you've set up a pixie-boot server, then you'll understand why I have PTSD.

42:21.680 --> 42:24.880
And if you haven't set up a pixie-boot server, I highly recommend it.

42:24.880 --> 42:28.320
It's a great, great opportunity to realize how little you know.

42:28.320 --> 42:29.320
Yes.

42:29.320 --> 42:32.920
And to learn something about the Linux boot process and all of the mysteries and vagaries

42:32.920 --> 42:34.880
that are contained within.

42:34.880 --> 42:36.760
And if you're going to do it, try iPixie.

42:36.760 --> 42:37.760
It's fantastic.

42:37.760 --> 42:40.400
Great open source project for managing all that stuff.

42:40.400 --> 42:41.400
Yeah.

42:41.400 --> 42:42.400
That's a good point.

42:42.400 --> 42:44.480
It was like, it used to be gpixie or something.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.560
Did they change their name at one point, if I recall?

42:46.560 --> 42:48.460
It's possible they did.

42:48.460 --> 42:49.800
But either way, they have a lot of great support.

42:49.800 --> 42:53.320
You can both run it, you know, you can like chain load into it, or they have some versions

42:53.320 --> 42:55.320
that you can flash onto like a pixie rom.

42:55.320 --> 42:57.680
Chain loading is really popular because people don't want to flash their roms on all their

42:57.680 --> 43:01.560
disparate machines, and it's pretty easy to push a config that just loads this binary

43:01.560 --> 43:02.560
up off the network.

43:02.560 --> 43:03.560
Yes.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.960
I mean, I think even like Arch Linux provides one of those, right?

43:05.960 --> 43:09.360
So you chain load into it and it automatically goes and grabs the latest images from their

43:09.360 --> 43:12.360
servers, which, hey, that's, that's pretty slick.

43:12.360 --> 43:19.320
So speaking of things that are slick, let's just let's just do we all love them.

43:19.320 --> 43:22.280
Let's jump over to our next sponsor this week.

43:22.280 --> 43:24.480
That's our friends over at Ting.

43:24.480 --> 43:25.480
What is Ting?

43:25.480 --> 43:28.320
Ting is the mobile service provider that just, it just makes sense.

43:28.320 --> 43:30.200
They make mobile make sense.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.200
And that's their mission.

43:31.200 --> 43:34.760
And that's what you'll find about Ting, things that you really love.

43:34.760 --> 43:35.760
They have a mission, right?

43:35.760 --> 43:38.400
They're just not I mean, obviously, they're business, they want to make money, but they

43:38.400 --> 43:39.400
have a mission.

43:39.400 --> 43:42.960
They are they are passionate people, and that is, that is to change mobile.

43:42.960 --> 43:44.840
So they, they resell, right?

43:44.840 --> 43:46.880
So they have they have both CDMA and GSM.

43:46.880 --> 43:49.960
And that I think really is one of the factors that's defined Ting.

43:49.960 --> 43:54.480
And it lets them it lets them change the way that the game that mobile is played, right?

43:54.480 --> 43:55.880
So they can focus on their customers.

43:55.880 --> 43:57.560
And that it's amazing.

43:57.560 --> 44:01.480
So whether you're using their app, which is great, whether using your web, their website,

44:01.480 --> 44:05.960
which is great, or you're actually calling in, and you get to talk to a real human, which

44:05.960 --> 44:09.640
you will, you'll find that there's some of the friendliest people, and they had some

44:09.640 --> 44:12.900
of the best customer service in the entire mobile industry.

44:12.900 --> 44:18.400
Beyond that, they have no contracts, no early termination fees, and you just pay for what

44:18.400 --> 44:19.400
you use.

44:19.400 --> 44:20.400
Yeah, that's right.

44:20.400 --> 44:25.200
Minutes, messages, megabytes, doesn't matter pay for what you use, and make it really easy

44:25.200 --> 44:26.640
to find out how much you'll save as well.

44:26.640 --> 44:28.560
So just head on over to ting.com, right?

44:28.560 --> 44:33.960
That's linux.ting.com, hit this, what would you save button, and there you'll find this

44:33.960 --> 44:36.920
wonderful rate chart, it's like, it's honestly, it's one of my favorite things.

44:36.920 --> 44:39.980
I kind of come here, even in my spare time, I just kind of click around.

44:39.980 --> 44:44.640
It's fun to just estimate, like, lines start at $6 a month.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.360
So whether you need it just as a backup cell phone that you keep in the truck for when

44:47.360 --> 44:51.420
you're out in the country, or if you use it as a backup data connection to your home server,

44:51.420 --> 44:52.420
it doesn't matter.

44:52.420 --> 44:54.720
It's $6 a month, you can kind of just forget about it.

44:54.720 --> 44:58.920
You buy one less coffee or one less hamburger, and then you have a whole ting line.

44:58.920 --> 45:02.520
And then you just kind of click around like, yeah, you know, someone might call me.

45:02.520 --> 45:06.880
So let's say I have 100 minutes, no one ever texts me, and I love it.

45:06.880 --> 45:07.880
So that's zero.

45:07.880 --> 45:10.520
And then all the rest of that, I can just spend on my data.

45:10.520 --> 45:14.960
And even if I use a gig of data, like, what happened, I lost my Wi Fi connection, I don't

45:14.960 --> 45:21.280
know, my monthly bill, yeah, that's right, $25 a month, and that number, that number,

45:21.280 --> 45:28.480
my friends, if you head over to linux.ting.com, you are going to get a $25 service credit.

45:28.480 --> 45:32.720
So as you can see, that will probably pay for your entire first month's bill, if not

45:32.720 --> 45:33.720
more.

45:33.720 --> 45:38.640
Or, or let's say you don't have a cell phone that you love, just pop on over to the Ting

45:38.640 --> 45:43.120
store, they've got an awesome selection of phones, they start at super reasonable prices.

45:43.120 --> 45:46.680
And if you want to, not on the necessarily, you know, you can't use it on the Alcatel

45:46.680 --> 45:47.680
one touch fling.

45:47.680 --> 45:51.480
But if you're if you're buying a nice new phone, you know, like this, Motorola Moto

45:51.480 --> 45:54.760
g4 play, that service credit can apply there too.

45:54.760 --> 45:56.880
Plus, they have a lot of stuff, you know, they understand that you might just want to

45:56.880 --> 46:00.000
use them as we were talking about the beginning of the show, you know, you might just want

46:00.000 --> 46:02.640
to use them as an LT connection to your house.

46:02.640 --> 46:06.600
If that's the case, they've got this home connect device, they've got a ton of options,

46:06.600 --> 46:08.340
they really make it easy.

46:08.340 --> 46:13.440
And you know what, on Ting, it really is mobile plans for adults, right on Ting, you don't

46:13.440 --> 46:16.160
you don't have to pay more for extra services, right?

46:16.160 --> 46:19.680
There's no, there's no contracts, there's no early termination fees, there's no add

46:19.680 --> 46:20.680
on charges.

46:20.680 --> 46:25.120
So voicemail, caller ID, tethering, hotspot, three way calling, call forwarding, all of

46:25.120 --> 46:28.280
these just come right with your service.

46:28.280 --> 46:31.920
So if you're unhappy with your mobile service plan, just go to linux.ting.com.

46:31.920 --> 46:36.800
Wes, can I tell you how Ting is going to be working with AskNoah?

46:36.800 --> 46:37.800
Please do.

46:37.800 --> 46:42.720
Not like the company Ting is going to be working officially with, not that, not that.

46:42.720 --> 46:46.200
But I'm going to activate a SIM and I have a product here and I'm throwing a link in

46:46.200 --> 46:47.200
the chat room.

46:47.200 --> 46:52.200
But basically, what this thing does is it gives me a public address, a public IP on

46:52.200 --> 46:53.520
Ting's LTE network.

46:53.520 --> 47:00.800
So the advantage is, what I can do is I can purchase this device and put a Ting LTE chip

47:00.800 --> 47:01.800
in it.

47:01.800 --> 47:05.200
And then I have a public address and I can plug that into this new remote broadcast system

47:05.200 --> 47:06.200
that we have.

47:06.200 --> 47:12.840
So I will be able to do AskNoah from anywhere as long as I have this device and a Ting GSM

47:12.840 --> 47:13.840
card.

47:13.840 --> 47:16.400
Of course, because it's only $6 a month, that's, that's all I have to pay.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.720
If I don't, you do a remote broadcast, oh, well, six bucks a month.

47:18.720 --> 47:23.120
And if I do a remote broadcast, I only pay for the data that I use.

47:23.120 --> 47:27.560
It really is, it really is great and it makes it very easy exactly for those kinds of use

47:27.560 --> 47:33.120
cases where you just want to plug and play, fit it into your workflow and it just works.

47:33.120 --> 47:40.240
So go over to linux.ting.com today and start saving on your monthly cell phone plan.

47:40.240 --> 47:50.600
Okay, so speaking of things that are maybe less efficient than our friends over at Ting,

47:50.600 --> 47:54.040
here's our goal, I just thought, no, no, it seemed kind of interesting to me just as a,

47:54.040 --> 47:57.440
just as a news update.

47:57.440 --> 48:03.200
Banks scramble to fix old systems as IT cowboys ride into the sunset.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.880
Oh, boy.

48:04.880 --> 48:07.520
Bill Hinshaw is not a typical 75 year old.

48:07.520 --> 48:11.440
He divides his time between his family, he has 32 grandchildren and great grandchildren,

48:11.440 --> 48:15.000
oh my, and helping US companies over crippling computer meltdowns.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.760
Hinshaw, who got into programming in the 1960s when computers took up entire rooms and programmers

48:19.760 --> 48:24.520
used punch cards, is a member of a dwindling community of IT veterans who specialize in

48:24.520 --> 48:27.520
a vintage programming language called COBOL.

48:27.520 --> 48:31.360
The common business oriented language developed nearly 60 years ago and has been gradually

48:31.360 --> 48:35.280
replaced by newer, more versatile languages such as Java, C and Python.

48:35.280 --> 48:39.320
Although few universities still offer COBOL courses, the language remains crucial to businesses

48:39.320 --> 48:43.280
and institutions around the world.

48:43.280 --> 48:47.640
In 2013, Hinshaw launched a new company, COBOL Cowboys, which connects companies to programmers

48:47.640 --> 48:48.820
like himself.

48:48.820 --> 48:51.360
So they're really, I love this quote here.

48:51.360 --> 48:55.420
Of the 20 cowboys that work as part time consultants, many have reached retirement age, though there

48:55.420 --> 48:57.840
are some youngsters, Hinshaw said.

48:57.840 --> 49:02.480
Well, I call them youngsters, but they're in their 40s, early 50s.

49:02.480 --> 49:05.360
Experienced COBOL programmers can earn more than $100 an hour when they get called in

49:05.360 --> 49:11.120
to patch up glitches, rewriting coding manuals, or making new systems work with the old.

49:11.120 --> 49:14.360
This seems to me like something that's going to keep happening as some of these really

49:14.360 --> 49:19.200
big companies kind of phase out into new systems.

49:19.200 --> 49:23.180
And I wonder, Noah, if you've seen any of this over at Autospeed or, you know, is this

49:23.180 --> 49:27.600
an area where Linux can really, you know, the flexibility of Linux, the open source,

49:27.600 --> 49:31.320
and just the ease of deployment and the, you know, it can really, it can fit in so many

49:31.320 --> 49:33.560
different use cases.

49:33.560 --> 49:37.000
Is this something that you have encountered or you see like a real opportunity for Linux

49:37.000 --> 49:38.840
to gain traction?

49:38.840 --> 49:40.680
I definitely see the opportunity for it.

49:40.680 --> 49:45.720
I can't say that we have, we have, we have executed on that opportunity at Autospeed.

49:45.720 --> 49:48.840
I know that's not very helpful to you.

49:48.840 --> 49:51.920
No, no, we've not really, we've not really taken that opportunity.

49:51.920 --> 49:52.920
Yeah.

49:52.920 --> 49:53.920
Okay.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.520
So Wizard, what would you like to say about that?

49:55.520 --> 49:58.640
Yeah, Noah, it's actually a legitimate problem.

49:58.640 --> 50:05.280
One of the big things, at least where I am right now, is so many old businesses just

50:05.280 --> 50:09.800
basically went off of COBOL and many old systems still rely on it.

50:09.800 --> 50:14.120
And there's just, you know, there's not a whole lot of places that teach it.

50:14.120 --> 50:18.360
And to be honest, you know, it's one of those things that a lot of, you know, university

50:18.360 --> 50:21.480
colleges, et cetera, will try and give us an option to students.

50:21.480 --> 50:22.480
But it's not fun.

50:22.480 --> 50:28.200
You know, it's not something that is used and can easily branch into other languages.

50:28.200 --> 50:34.280
Just because of really what COBOL is, it really is something that was used in the seventies

50:34.280 --> 50:38.120
and designed in the sixties and it doesn't translate well to other languages.

50:38.120 --> 50:42.800
So it's almost a disservice to teach it to people because it's like, okay, we'll teach

50:42.800 --> 50:47.680
you COBOL, but if you want to go and learn Java, Python, whatever, it's just, you know,

50:47.680 --> 50:50.280
it's almost, you've lost a full semester.

50:50.280 --> 50:53.200
It's kind of kicking the can down the road, so to speak.

50:53.200 --> 50:54.200
Exactly.

50:54.200 --> 50:55.200
Yeah.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.680
You know, it's not helpful.

50:56.680 --> 51:02.240
And this is the thing, like so many banks and I'm not kidding, like I bet you, I would

51:02.240 --> 51:07.160
say over probably 60% of all banks in the US and Canada and probably just North America

51:07.160 --> 51:11.080
in general, all use COBOL.

51:11.080 --> 51:16.280
It's just, it's there, it's omnipresent and everyone in the back rooms are panicking because

51:16.280 --> 51:22.360
like even, you know, where I work, we have COBOL programs and we're not even in the financial

51:22.360 --> 51:25.220
sector, which is where it was huge.

51:25.220 --> 51:27.600
So it touches everything.

51:27.600 --> 51:28.840
Yep.

51:28.840 --> 51:33.560
I think that's exactly right.

51:33.560 --> 51:37.280
And it's one of those areas like, you know, you're just stuck in the past, you know, you

51:37.280 --> 51:39.960
maybe need like specific mainframes to run it on.

51:39.960 --> 51:42.700
You have these systems that are business critical where you really, you know, your business

51:42.700 --> 51:47.400
depends on not having downtime, having the systems work and maybe you just, you know,

51:47.400 --> 51:50.120
you don't have experts left.

51:50.120 --> 51:54.640
IBM Systems E series is completely, almost completely funded just by COBOL.

51:54.640 --> 51:55.640
Wow.

51:55.640 --> 51:56.640
Hugely.

51:56.640 --> 52:02.480
So you go in and you see the S396 package, you'll sometimes see in distro packages and

52:02.480 --> 52:06.000
things like that and you're like, that's kind of odd, I don't remember that being that.

52:06.000 --> 52:11.720
That's the IBM Systems E system and that's almost all funded by COBOL.

52:11.720 --> 52:12.720
Interesting.

52:12.720 --> 52:13.720
Oh, okay.

52:13.720 --> 52:20.080
Well, so I think that's a good segue to transition to something a little more modern and that

52:20.080 --> 52:21.120
is Pinterest.

52:21.120 --> 52:26.720
So Linux.com has been having a neat series about the companies that support Linux and

52:26.720 --> 52:31.580
open source and this week they'd like to hire, they'd like to, you know, they'd like to talk

52:31.580 --> 52:32.580
about Pinterest.

52:32.580 --> 52:35.920
So I thought this was kind of interesting just as someone, you know, who's very interested

52:35.920 --> 52:36.920
in open source.

52:36.920 --> 52:40.360
I think we all are attached to it as a platform and see that it, you know, it should be used

52:40.360 --> 52:43.340
and supported by these big internet companies.

52:43.340 --> 52:49.220
So Libby Clark here talks with John Price over the technical architecture lead and open

52:49.220 --> 52:52.800
source program lead over at Pinterest and I just thought this was like a really interesting

52:52.800 --> 52:56.540
article kind of just about, one, if you don't know what Pinterest is, not that I use it,

52:56.540 --> 53:00.840
but just as an example of one of these popular websites whose user base doesn't use Linux

53:00.840 --> 53:06.440
isn't aware of Linux really maybe, I mean some are sure, but where a lot of that, you

53:06.440 --> 53:09.920
know, all that technology on the background is powered by it.

53:09.920 --> 53:15.300
So, you know, part of the stuff here is they ask how and why do you use Linux in open source?

53:15.300 --> 53:19.600
And he answers, Pinterest is built on open source from our first lines of Django code

53:19.600 --> 53:24.680
over six years ago to the release of Ruxplicator, our latest open source project, we've directly

53:24.680 --> 53:28.360
benefited from open source projects and the support of communities surrounding them.

53:28.360 --> 53:32.120
In turn, we've made significant contributions to the open source technologies we use and

53:32.120 --> 53:34.680
have pushed the limits of technologies like HBase.

53:34.680 --> 53:37.960
Internally, open source is part of a product cycle.

53:37.960 --> 53:39.720
I think that's a key thing.

53:39.720 --> 53:43.880
We frequently open source the technologies we build as both a way to give back to the

53:43.880 --> 53:47.400
communities and because it's the right thing to do.

53:47.400 --> 53:49.440
So they've recently joined the Linux Foundation.

53:49.440 --> 53:50.440
I think that's neat.

53:50.440 --> 53:54.600
And they talk about how the Linux Foundation is home to Linux, it's home to Node.js and

53:54.600 --> 53:59.200
other mission critical projects that form the backbone of modern internet services,

53:59.200 --> 54:02.200
such as people like, like Pinterest.

54:02.200 --> 54:06.860
I just thought this was like a neat article kind of highlighting like, how, how useful

54:06.860 --> 54:11.200
open source is and one of the good guys because we see a lot of companies that use open source,

54:11.200 --> 54:14.640
but might not be very active in supporting it might not be give back might not open source

54:14.640 --> 54:15.640
their own tools.

54:15.640 --> 54:16.640
Not that they have to, right?

54:16.640 --> 54:19.620
I mean, if they modify a GPL code, yes, they do.

54:19.620 --> 54:23.320
But for a lot of these, you know, that's not the license or they're not redistributing

54:23.320 --> 54:24.320
it.

54:24.320 --> 54:29.680
So it's really nice to see kind of how people in these key positions at these companies

54:29.680 --> 54:33.200
are able to give back or how they see open source as part of their workflow, how it can

54:33.200 --> 54:38.880
make them make their jobs easier and help them, you know, be a successful business.

54:38.880 --> 54:39.880
I agree.

54:39.880 --> 54:45.120
And I also think it's very interesting that you, you are now seeing these large companies,

54:45.120 --> 54:48.880
you know, and I saw this a lot with Dell, where they're not just interested in making

54:48.880 --> 54:50.520
a buck off the back of open source.

54:50.520 --> 54:52.800
They're genuinely interested in contributing upstream.

54:52.800 --> 54:56.660
They're genuinely interested in being a valuable resource to the community, becoming a part

54:56.660 --> 55:01.680
of the community and growing with the community rather than stomping at the backs of the community

55:01.680 --> 55:02.680
to make their money.

55:02.680 --> 55:03.680
Right?

55:03.680 --> 55:04.680
Right.

55:04.680 --> 55:05.680
Yes, exactly.

55:05.680 --> 55:06.680
And it's not, you know, there's nothing wrong with making money.

55:06.680 --> 55:11.440
And in fact, I think we should encourage, you know, people to build profitable businesses

55:11.440 --> 55:12.440
using this.

55:12.440 --> 55:15.720
But that's where it's awesome to see that like, yeah, we realize and you know, especially

55:15.720 --> 55:18.680
like when you can open source something, a lot of times, you know, especially if you

55:18.680 --> 55:22.280
do a good job, it's not just like, what, you know, throwing it over the wall and forgetting

55:22.280 --> 55:23.280
about it.

55:23.280 --> 55:27.060
But if you can make sure that like, you know, you use the open source app from the public

55:27.060 --> 55:31.920
GitHub internally, then you get to benefit from all the feature, you know, new features,

55:31.920 --> 55:35.440
bug fixes, anything else that the awesome community of open source people are going

55:35.440 --> 55:36.440
to provide for you.

55:36.440 --> 55:41.840
There's also an interesting thing that Pinterest does as far as like the design of their website

55:41.840 --> 55:47.680
was like the first one to do like a fully like a column responsive card based system

55:47.680 --> 55:54.200
that's like constantly adjusting itself for the size of the content.

55:54.200 --> 56:00.560
They release some of their code for the how that works and also an API that explains stuff.

56:00.560 --> 56:04.440
So the documentation was taken to make like, and there's like, probably five or six frameworks

56:04.440 --> 56:07.760
now that are built on top of that, that design structure.

56:07.760 --> 56:12.520
Oh, yeah, that's an interesting, that's an interesting history as you know, as we've

56:12.520 --> 56:17.720
come to this like single page app future that we all live in now.

56:17.720 --> 56:24.560
Okay, so talking about open source thing, open source projects, over at Dave Cheney's

56:24.560 --> 56:28.880
blog, he has a post, something we've touched on a little bit, but I think we've seen this

56:28.880 --> 56:31.760
trend only continue, I wanted to revisit it.

56:31.760 --> 56:37.240
He writes about why slack is inappropriate for open source communications.

56:37.240 --> 56:43.920
He says, Okay, also full disclosure, his employer does make a slack alternative.

56:43.920 --> 56:44.920
So that's something to know.

56:44.920 --> 56:48.680
But he's tweeted a few times about my frustration with the movement of open source projects

56:48.680 --> 56:53.480
from open asynchronous communication tools like forums, mailing lists and issue trackers

56:53.480 --> 56:57.380
to closed synchronous communication services like slack.

56:57.380 --> 56:59.940
This post is a long form version of this gripe.

56:59.940 --> 57:04.320
So he first starts out with what is slack good for?

57:04.320 --> 57:07.040
Before I stick the boot in, let's talk about the good things about synchronous chat applications

57:07.040 --> 57:09.360
like slack, hip chat, and so on.

57:09.360 --> 57:13.160
In a work context, chat applications take place take the place of at staff email blasts

57:13.160 --> 57:16.520
about fire system testing, broken live, blah, blah, you know, all those things.

57:16.520 --> 57:20.940
It's a place where you can, you know, you know that people are, are there and have seen

57:20.940 --> 57:21.940
your messages.

57:21.940 --> 57:25.560
But in the context of an open source project, slack, hip chat, getter, etc, they they provide

57:25.560 --> 57:30.640
a forum for advocacy, gossip, informal discussion and support right in some ways very similar

57:30.640 --> 57:34.480
to what you might find in an IRC room.

57:34.480 --> 57:39.080
These complaints start when slack and friends are promoted as a recommended way to communicate

57:39.080 --> 57:40.560
with the project.

57:40.560 --> 57:45.520
So then he writes, why is slack bad for open source communication?

57:45.520 --> 57:48.640
One slack at all are paid services with closed memberships.

57:48.640 --> 57:52.520
Sure, there are lots of little apps running on heroku dinos that automate the send me

57:52.520 --> 57:53.520
an invite process.

57:53.520 --> 57:56.560
But fundamentally, these are closed systems.

57:56.560 --> 57:59.000
This means that the content inside those systems is closed.

57:59.000 --> 58:01.560
I cannot link to a discussion in a slack channel in a tweet.

58:01.560 --> 58:06.040
I cannot refer to it in an issue report and I cannot cite it in a presentation.

58:06.040 --> 58:09.580
Knowledge is siloed to those who have the time and the ability to participate in chat

58:09.580 --> 58:11.480
services in real time.

58:11.480 --> 58:16.480
And then secondly, slack at all are based on synchronous communication, which discriminates

58:16.480 --> 58:20.960
against those who do not or cannot take part of the conversation in real time.

58:20.960 --> 58:23.940
For example, real time chat discriminates against those who aren't in the same time

58:23.940 --> 58:26.840
zone, you can't fully participate in an open source project.

58:26.840 --> 58:29.560
If all the discussion happens while you're asleep.

58:29.560 --> 58:32.520
And if you are in the same time zone real time chat assumes a privilege that you have

58:32.520 --> 58:36.480
the spare time or employer who doesn't mind you being constantly distracted to be virtually

58:36.480 --> 58:38.380
present in a chat room.

58:38.380 --> 58:41.460
Online chat clients are resource hogs and presume the availability of a fast computer

58:41.460 --> 58:44.240
and ample always on internet connection.

58:44.240 --> 58:48.800
Again, raising the bar for participation.

58:48.800 --> 58:51.320
So yeah, what do you think of that?

58:51.320 --> 58:52.320
Yeah, okay.

58:52.320 --> 58:53.320
So let's start and break this down.

58:53.320 --> 58:57.500
First of all, I don't necessarily agree with this premise that slack is not the best choice

58:57.500 --> 58:58.880
for open source communities.

58:58.880 --> 59:03.720
I I'm having a hard time agreeing with how he arrived at that solution in any way, shape

59:03.720 --> 59:05.640
or form, even stretching my imagination out.

59:05.640 --> 59:08.960
Let me explain why to.

59:08.960 --> 59:13.600
So first of all, this a string in his versus synchronous chat, when I am working particularly

59:13.600 --> 59:19.360
at all to speed, we work with people from all over the country and sometimes from people

59:19.360 --> 59:20.440
outside the country, right?

59:20.440 --> 59:26.440
But I expect those people to deliver on any in a time fashion that is conducive to my

59:26.440 --> 59:27.440
clients, right?

59:27.440 --> 59:32.400
So I don't want to hear, well, it's 5 a.m. my time, so I'm not going to address those

59:32.400 --> 59:34.680
messages or respond to that ticket too bad.

59:34.680 --> 59:35.680
Then don't work for me.

59:35.680 --> 59:40.040
Go work for someone that has your time zone because we have a deadline to meet and you

59:40.040 --> 59:41.280
need to meet those deadlines.

59:41.280 --> 59:46.560
And I'd be happy to take to take your labor and, you know, compensate you for that.

59:46.560 --> 59:49.800
But you need to meet the need to meet the requirements of the business.

59:49.800 --> 59:54.360
So that that to me sounds like a ridiculous premise that we can't have real, we shouldn't

59:54.360 --> 59:57.220
have real time communication because it might exclude some people.

59:57.220 --> 01:00:01.360
Those people need to work when the work is getting done, unless their job like, you know,

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.360
the web guy, right?

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.720
I don't care if the web guy does his job at three in the morning or seven in the morning,

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:06.720
I'll send him requirements.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.720
That's perfectly fine.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:13.800
And there's no reason why he can't use slack to I can put what I want in and he can pick

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.100
that message up when he has time.

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:18.480
I think slack perfectly supports synchronous and asynchronous communication.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.800
So I disagree with this premise there.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:27.600
The the reason that I have a problem with slack is because it's not open source.

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.840
It is tied to a central service.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.880
But the reality that we live in is that people, especially businesses, tend to go with the

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.440
lowest common denominator and they tend to go with the place of the path of least resistance.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.720
And the thing is with slack and I know this just from just from my experience at Jupiter

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.840
Broadcasting.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.080
It's not that we wouldn't want to go to another service.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.960
It's not that we don't want to use something else.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:52.920
But somebody else has to make that product or service available so that I can go to the

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:56.800
website, sign up with my username and password, click on a button and then it's just up and

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:01.080
somebody else has to manage it and update it and maintain it and deal with all of the

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.080
times and stuff.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:06.400
Because frankly, at Jupiter Broadcasting, we just don't have the resources to manage

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.000
every single thing ourselves, even though in an ideal world, even though from an ideological

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.960
standpoint, we acknowledge that that's a better way to go.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.320
It simply isn't cost effective.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.200
It simply isn't practical sometimes.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.200
No, I think that's a really good point.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:23.200
And that's I think that's a lot of how people get hooked in the parts that most resonated

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.200
with me.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:29.360
So I think you're right, like that, you know, it does it does work well for close teams

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.680
or you know, when you have an accountability thing, right, like we're all going to be here.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:34.680
We need to get this done.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:38.600
I expect you to be, you know, responsive to me.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.400
What struck me about it was just the you know, like you can't reference it.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.320
It is close, like you can't, you know, on bug reports or other things.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.640
You can't easily link to a Slack conversation if you don't have an account there.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:51.480
I think the other thing too, is for open source projects, right, like you might be a really

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:54.100
big contributor to a project.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:58.760
But if if you know, most of the core team is in America, and they have a Slack conversation,

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.240
and that is what's considered, like, that's how we decided we were going to do this next

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.640
move or yes, we were going to accept this PR.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.720
You might feel very left out in, you know, if instead it was a mailing list discussion,

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:15.240
or over the course of a couple days, then you, when you were awake, you could respond

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.240
to it.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.960
Now, obviously, that makes a much slower cycle, and that might not work for a lot of people.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:22.040
But I guess I can see where he's coming from.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:29.360
Well, couldn't you argue that, like, I agree that what Noah said about the asynchronous

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.980
versus synchronous, that's not the issue with Slack.

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:39.060
You could argue that the private aspect of Slack is what makes it appealing to companies,

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:44.600
whereas open source projects don't really work that well for any kind of private chat

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.600
like that.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.600
Exactly.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:50.760
But in the sense of the open source software, you wouldn't even need Slack in the first

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:55.000
place, because there are alternatives that provide the exact same functionality, including

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.720
asynchronous and synchronous.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:04.880
So at Intergos, we did a test to see if we could get, basically have an IRC channel that

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:10.400
also has asynchronous chat, so anytime anybody wants to have a conversation about it, they

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.120
can go scroll back up and look at anything.

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.440
And you can do that with Matrix.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:20.960
So if you create a Matrix bridge with IRC channels, you can have the benefits of IRC,

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:27.760
which is real time, and you can have the asynchronous benefits of Matrix, and have the conversation

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.760
completely synced.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.440
So either way, if you're available now or available later, you can still be included

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.400
in the conversation.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.320
I think that's a very good point, and I think the Matrix project is definitely something

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.040
that people, if they aren't familiar with it, that's definitely something that they

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.120
should check out.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.240
So something you said, Noah, that made me think that it's a perfect segue for us.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.600
So you're talking about like, a lot of times we don't have the resources, especially podcasts

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.600
are the first thing.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.800
Content creation is really what Jupyter Broadcasting focuses on, and we don't always have the time

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.720
or extra time to focus on building our own servers, maintaining them.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.020
But something that really helps me when I do need, you know, when we do have business

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:08.480
critical needs, podcast critical needs to get things done, that's our friends over at

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.480
Linux Academy.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:17.040
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged, start, you'll get a seven day free trial, sorry,

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.480
one week free trial to Linux Academy, and believe me, if you're anything like me, you

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.480
will be hooked.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.480
So what is Linux Academy?

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:28.160
Linux Academy, it's the Linux first online training program, right?

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:31.840
This is not like one of those sites where it's, you know, focused on academic courses,

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.160
or it's focused on just teaching you, you know, how to garden, how to knit, oh, yeah,

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.640
and how to install Apache on your server.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.200
No, Linux Academy is built by Linux experts, people who've been using Linux for years who

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.840
use it on the server.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:49.780
They've come together to make this awesome courseware a cohesive program that will teach

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:54.480
you all the skills you need to get your next job in open source, in the private industry,

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.400
wherever you want to go.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.000
Linux Academy, they've really come a long way.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.720
You can run on any of seven plus available Linux distributions, and they customize their

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.080
courseware to make sure that it works for you, right?

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:08.160
So oh, I really need to get, you know, my next, I got a new job.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.680
I've been on Debian for my whole life, but they're using Red Hat.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:14.100
Linux Academy, just turn there, it's the perfect place to go.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.640
They have all these nifty features that really, it really takes them to the next level, right?

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:22.880
There's a lot of online tutorials or resources for learning things, you know, I can go Google

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.720
X tutorial and find something.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:32.360
Linux Academy is not really in that same space because what they provide is up-to-date, maintained,

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:38.280
state-of-the-art interactive courses taught by real instructors with community members.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:42.080
So you have this whole platform of people who are trying to learn the same thing.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:46.800
And what's most helpful to me is they have this, they know how long it's going to take

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.800
you, right?

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.080
So you can, it gives you the ability to estimate, like, I really need to learn Ruby, right?

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.080
I don't know Ruby.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.080
I come from Python.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.960
I need Ruby for my next job.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960
How long it's going to take me?

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.960
How do I learn it?

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.280
You don't have to go struggle and like, oh, do I buy a book?

01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.280
Do I, what do I do?

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.920
No, just go to Linux Academy.

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:05.280
They've got these courses that will one, there's a lot of industry respect for, so it'll, you

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.040
know, your employer will see that and say, look, they've, you know, they can go look

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.080
what these courses are and understand exactly what you've learned and understand that you've

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.480
proven yourself and that what your skill level is at.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:18.520
And two, they give you tools to say like, okay, this is a six-hour class.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.520
This is how long it's going to take.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.520
I can expect that's what it's going to be.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.760
And at the end of it, you have very quantified outcomes about what you're going to know and

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.080
what you're going to be able to do.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.280
And they have a ton of tools to let you keep track of your progress, right?

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:34.760
So you're not like, oh, yeah, last week when I had time, which chapter was I on?

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.760
What was I learning?

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:41.040
Now, Linux Academy, it's very structured so that it gives you, especially for busy professionals,

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.880
busy students, whatever you are, right?

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.960
You're busy with trying to make things and you just need a little bit of help.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:50.920
And Linux Academy is at that perfect level where these are the people, you know, they

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.080
use it every day.

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.080
They've come from this background.

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:55.720
They've built their whole site using Linux, so they really are experts.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.800
They really do dog food it.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:03.360
And if you're in one of those situations where you need to learn AWS or something like that,

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.360
it comes with the server.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.040
You don't have to worry about spinning up a new AWS server and then a year later getting

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.040
a big bill from AWS.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.800
No, Linux Academy takes care of it.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.160
They spin up just the distro that you need.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:17.720
You get your own server to play with so you can interact with the courseware.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:22.440
So if you have some goals, you want to get a new job in DevOps, open source, backend

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:28.580
servers, head over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, start your seven day free trial,

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:32.300
take some courses, try some of their nuggets, which are just, you know, little bite-sized

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:39.080
tasty morsels of learning that really get you started and really get you hooked, linuxacademy.com

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.440
slash unplugged.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:50.880
All right, so I think that brings us to our discussion topic this week.

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:56.600
And that is the big news over at our friends at Ubuntu.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.520
Ubuntu abandoning Unity in favor of GNOME.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:06.440
So on April 5, Canonical announced that they would no longer be developing Unity and they

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:09.040
were going to transition 4.18.04 to GNOME.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:16.200
This also, you know, that's also had implications for their mobile platform as well as, you

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.080
know, the mirror display manager.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.080
There's a lot going on.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.680
It was covered in Linux Action Show.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.160
I just thought this might be a really good platform for the Mumble Room.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.200
I think we were all, you know, it was kind of a surprise.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.720
It was a big surprise in some of the biggest Linux news this year, I would say.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.320
Noah, I'd like to turn it over to you.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:40.760
What were your thoughts as someone who's deployed a lot of Unity desktops and a lot of Ubuntu

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.960
operating systems?

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:47.840
I think that Ubuntu from the start has been marching to the beat of their own drum with

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.160
their own desktop environment.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:53.720
And I think that they have done a lot of really positive things in the space.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.840
In fact, I stand by this.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:02.040
I think they have the best multi-monitor support of any desktop environment, bar none.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.580
Not GNOME, not KDE.

01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:09.200
Unity really perfected the multi-monitor support to the point that I could use six monitors

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.800
flawlessly.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:15.040
And so I have this internal dichotomy.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:20.680
On one hand, I would really like to see, I've really wanted to see Ubuntu working with the

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.740
existing desktop environments that are supported on multiple distros and stuff like that.

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.440
And so we have everyone kind of working on the same page.

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:31.000
And on the other hand, I definitely can see where Unity shines through.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.320
When you sit down at an Ubuntu desktop, it's very, very evident that the desktop environment

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:38.680
is made by the same people that make the operating system and that all of the applications that

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:40.880
run are aware of how the desktop works.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:41.880
So I'll give you an example.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.840
You mean because it's all purple, right?

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:45.840
That's part of it.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.680
The background change, you know, you change the background and then the bar and stuff

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.680
will change to a company.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.680
There's little stuff like that.

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:56.700
But more than that, though, there are so many times in GNOME or GNOME where I will install

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:59.680
an application and it doesn't seem to be aware of an extension.

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:03.560
And the best example I have of that is the dash to dock extension.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.740
So you turn on that extension.

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:08.520
If I maximize a window, it's clearly not aware that there is a dock there and it will extend

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.280
past the dock and I can't click on certain buttons.

01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:14.840
And I've tried the auto hide and, you know, I talked to Chris about this frustration.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.800
His answer was basically, well, just don't use the dock, just get rid, just stop using

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.800
the dock.

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:24.760
And, you know, if there's a feature that I like and it is available, I feel like I should

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:25.760
be able to use it.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.900
But there is no feature inside of Unity that if you turn it on or you enable it, it makes

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:33.040
something else not work correctly, right?

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.500
So it has a very cohesive feel to it and there's a lot of polish to it.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:37.980
And so I commend them for that.

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:45.140
And I hope that they can take that same direction, focus and leadership of polish and bring that

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.600
to the GNOME desktop and tie that back into Ubuntu.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.220
I think that would be really, really great.

01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:55.140
But overall, I have to say, and I know this is a little bit frustrating for the people

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.840
that are really in love with Unity, I think this is the right decision.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.040
I think it's the right decision for a number of reasons.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:03.540
One, because I think that it's going to be a really great thing for Linux as a whole

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:08.040
to have the biggest manufacturers of the desktop Linux operating system, that being Red Hat

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:13.720
and Canonical, both of them working together to form a single desktop environment.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.600
And I think it's going to be really good for the end users because they're going to have

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.920
more freedom to go from one to store the other.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.560
And it's all going to look the same because, hey, they're starting with GNOME.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:27.040
Right, it might also, you know, like there'll be more, perhaps more resources now dedicated

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:31.080
to GNOME or more interest, or we can kind of, you know, focus there and it maybe provides

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:38.440
a little bit more pressure on that to not just be a Fedora, Red Hat style project, but,

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.960
you know, have another really big name in the Linux community throwing their weight

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:42.960
behind it.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.360
Wizard, you had some thoughts about this, especially as it relates to the mobile industry.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:52.280
Yeah, I actually had Amazio Pro 5, which was the Ubuntu phone.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:56.440
I used it every single day from the time I got it.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:07.920
The big thing that I noticed anyway was Ubuntu on mobile, I don't know, as to the OS, there

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.920
was work to be done.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.920
I'll put it that way.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.960
There was a lot of work that needed to be done.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:17.340
But the one thing that was actually like the shining light in everything else was the applications

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.640
that they made for it.

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:25.200
For example, their Deco app, which was the email app for an Ubuntu phone, was excellent.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:29.400
I would love to see that come to the desktop and to see that not die.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.480
Yeah, it's absolutely lovely.

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.480
It's I'm amazed.

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.160
It's also already coming to the desktop right now.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.160
Yeah.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.160
And that's great.

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:40.400
Isn't part of the beauty of open source that if there are enough people like you that really

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:46.480
like the Ubuntu phone, the Unity 8 on Ubuntu phone, isn't it great that there is a there

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:51.640
is a system in which the market can speak and say, we want this project to continue.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:53.880
People can fork it and it will continue outside of Canonical.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.520
Isn't that a great thing?

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.600
And that's the thing.

01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.760
And I would hope that maybe Canonical wouldn't completely throw everything out the window,

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.040
as it seems like everyone is saying they should right now.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:08.440
I would say that maybe with them going to GNOME and that they don't have to pay as much

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:13.920
attention to their own, you know, their own DE, that maybe they can focus instead on the

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:19.160
applications and maybe more of the greatness that I saw in the applications and not have

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:25.400
to worry about, you know, mirror or you know, whatever their back end stuff is with Redhat

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.160
also helping with this now.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.560
Yep, that's a I think that's a good point.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:34.000
Ryan, you want to chime in as a from the perspective of someone who also has you know, you guys

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.160
are shipping a lot of Ubuntu desktops as well.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.840
Yeah, oh, boy.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.840
That was a day.

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.840
I bet.

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.840
Oh, boy.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:52.000
So we were getting ready to go into a meeting with Canonical to discuss something else.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:00.120
And then we see the yes, and I at first it just got shared with me in the System76 Telegram

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.120
chat.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:07.280
And that's just full of, you know, kind of our fans and customers.

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:14.280
And I read it and suddenly that whole day changed.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:19.440
We have a lot of users who work here who who they're Linux enthusiasts, they play with

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:26.880
other desktops, Cassidy here even is one of the main contributors to elementary.

01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.920
So we're very familiar with other desktops.

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:40.640
But it was so out of the blue and it was so I mean, we didn't know.

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.640
Everybody asked, did you guys know?

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.200
We had no idea this was coming.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:52.480
And so we kind of immediately stopped everything that we were doing and started talking about

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:59.120
what implications that had, because a lot of folks don't realize how much work and how

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:05.160
much upstream work we put into making these things, making, you know, Unity 7 work correctly

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.560
on our machine.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:13.920
What specifically is System76 doing to make this easier for their customers?

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:25.080
So earlier today, OMG Ubuntu posted a story that covered kind of our thought process and

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:27.160
what we think about the future.

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:31.400
The first thing I want to say is that the is and I think we should always do this is

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:37.580
that there were there were people who who poured, you know, a ton of years of their

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:46.120
lives into, you know, six, six years into Unity and that converged vision.

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.520
And some of those people don't have jobs today.

01:15:49.520 --> 01:16:03.580
But the but jumping off of that, we we are looking at our taking Gnome and adding our

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:06.000
own touch to it.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.440
So are you are you saying that you're going to take what canonical ships and what Gnome

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.520
is shipping is stock and then System76 is going to modify that and add to that before

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:19.420
they ship it to their customers?

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:20.420
That's correct.

01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:23.120
We are not going to be forking anything.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:30.880
We're not going to be doing anything that that represents, I guess, bloat.

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:35.960
We're just going to be adding nice little touches using extensions that ship with the

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:39.720
desktop and so here's a question for you.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:44.880
I read an article that was that kind of when when when Mark Shuttle work with that was

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:49.400
asked, he said, they asked him, they said, you know, or how do you feel about this?

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.400
What are you going to do?

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:51.400
Are you going to modify Gnome?

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.920
And his answer was, you know, we need to respect the desktop development team.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.560
We need to respect the work that Gnome is doing.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:00.480
And so if Gnome believes that this is the best way to ship a desktop, well, then it

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:03.960
canonical, we're just going to back them and we are going to accept that that is their

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:04.960
design philosophy.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.960
We will.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:09.320
Well, obviously we'll offer input, but at the end of the day, we are going to deliver

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:13.800
the desktop the way that Gnome intends the desktop to be delivered.

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:18.880
Are you saying that that's not System76's view that you guys that that's you're going

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.960
to do something different?

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:26.360
Well, first I want to say that we have been in conversations with the Gnome community

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:32.480
and with, you know, some of the main contributors over there since the announcement, or at least

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:37.080
some of them, some of the people on the board of directors and so on.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:46.200
So I don't think what we're doing will represent a getting away from stock Gnome.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:52.400
I mean, it's just a layer of visual.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.400
Our own design.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.400
Sorry.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.680
I mean, that's what extensions and theming is for is is for we think we want to offer

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:04.440
a System76 experience from the time you buy the machine being on the website and seeing

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:11.000
kind of our design touches and what we think of how how things should look and feel.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.920
And we want the people to have that same experience when they get their box.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.400
Absolutely, you know, that cohesive experience is great.

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.400
Absolutely.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.160
Having been to System76, I have seen you guys do this in person, you know, where you make

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:23.160
these tweaks.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.320
And so I can definitely appreciate that.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:28.280
But at the same time, having been a Gnome user and seeing how these extensions that

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.960
I mean, it's being pointed out to me right in the chat that, you know, a lot of these

01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:36.400
extensions, they really aren't they're really not it's we have to separate an extension

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.040
from actually being part of Gnome.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:41.960
It seems like it would be it would it would provide a better experience if you could get

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:44.500
those changes enacted right at Gnome.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:48.420
If you're working with the Gnome people, why can't why can't those changes be pushed to

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:54.000
Gnome as a whole rather than, you know, System76 specific systems with these?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.040
Oh, oh, really?

01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.960
Yeah, you can look at all the examples of like, the most one of the most basic things

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:03.000
that people want is top icons.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:10.060
And people ask Gnome to include that extension, like five years ago, and Gnome's like, no,

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.060
because we don't want it.

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:13.240
That's not our design vision.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:16.440
And so and so that that's what that's what brings me to this interesting question is

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.280
if Gnome has has made a line in the sand, and they're like, this is not what we want

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.280
to deliver.

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:22.900
This isn't the design vision that we have.

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:25.480
And Canonical is willing to accept that.

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:29.600
Doesn't it seem a little doesn't it seem a little strange that System76 is going to say,

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.440
no, we're we really believe that X is what customers want.

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:36.260
And so we're going to deliver X.

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:41.000
So all of our all of our work will be open source, and we're not going to do anything

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:51.600
that represents that that goes against the I this goals that Gnome is striving for.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:58.840
But top icons is an excellent example of an extension that see that people have an expectation

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:06.840
of, especially our users who who might be moving from Unity and doing a direct upgrade

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:10.280
to a Gnome desktop.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:13.680
You know, this is going to be a big transition for a lot of them.

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:19.280
Of course, we're going to have documentation on how to turn these things off in Gnome tweak.

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.800
It's fairly easy.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:26.960
And if we can get this accepted upstream, which based on my conversations this week,

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:31.760
doesn't seem out of the question, we're going to collaborate with Gnome on that.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:39.680
And hopefully we don't have to ship anything that is that isn't part of the Gnome experience.

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:45.840
The the thing is, is that in my conversations, it seems like the Gnome community is taking

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.840
a look at itself.

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:51.000
And I don't want to speak for them, but it seemed like they were really doing some soul

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.660
searching on on what hills they're willing to die on, you know, in order to accommodate

01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:02.400
the new users who are in the new contributors who are coming to the project.

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.280
And I take them their word on that.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:09.680
I think that they're open to some of these conversations that they've maybe had before

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:14.300
because we're here and we're willing to contribute.

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:18.760
And we already are talking about how we can contribute to Wayland and how we can contribute

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:21.800
to big projects that they're working on.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:29.120
And so I think that I don't know what that looks like, but I but I know some of the things

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:35.520
that we've already identified that seem like no brainers that we would really like to offer

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.520
our customers.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:43.580
We we sat around for a long time and offered Unity 7, which was in maintenance mode and

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:50.320
things that our customers asked for, things that we got feedback from for every day.

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:56.580
We waited on someone else to implement and I'm not sure that we're going to continue

01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:02.560
doing that when our customers provide that type of feedback and they clearly have demands

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.560
and desires.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:09.440
It was actually really funny because I think it should be I think it should.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:13.720
I was just going to say the feedback that they got on Hacker News that Canonical got

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:19.880
on Hacker News, most of that feedback we'd already documented from our own customers,

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:28.400
you know, and so we we were starting to collaborate on Unity 7, you know, doing high DPI support,

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:32.800
doing scaling between monitors, which should be available for our customers here soon and

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:33.800
upstream.

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:40.520
So I think that I think what we're trying to do is create the perfect experience, or

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.920
at least as close as we can get to it.

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:47.640
And if we have to enable some extensions to do that, we're going to do that.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:51.920
I think Rikai asked a really good question here in the IRC room.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:55.600
Was there any consideration of moving to a different Ubuntu official flavor?

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:59.040
Seems like this would be a good time to consider that considering this is kind of a time of

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:02.040
forced change anyway.

01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:11.640
Yeah, everything was on the table when we got the when we read the announcement.

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:14.720
Yeah, that's fair.

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.520
I just want to I just want to say it just so it's said at least once.

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:22.160
You know, the the GNOME team has been doing an excellent job of delivering on a class

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:25.000
A desktop for a long time.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.160
And so as you know, if a distribution and a computer manufacturer wants to take advantage

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:36.040
of all the all the hard work and contribute back to all the hard work that the GNOME team

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:39.380
has done, I think it I think it needs to be at least said once that we need to keep in

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:44.880
mind that this is a team that has a direction that they are they are going and input is

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:45.880
always welcome.

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:49.680
Ultimately, though, I think it's important that, you know, that, you know, your comment

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:53.280
about something that you said, you know, kind of rubbed me and you said something along

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:57.440
the lines of like, now they might be more open because of all these new users that are

01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:58.440
coming there.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:02.920
But those new users and that new user base and all of those projects that, you know,

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:07.120
that are, you know, now coming over to GNOME because of, you know, Canonical's decisions,

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.840
I think they need to come into it with the understanding that, you know, they are already

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:11.840
on this train.

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.840
This train is already moving.

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:16.040
If you'd like to come along for the ride, offer some input, help us steer the train

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.040
fine.

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.600
But we're not going to derail the train, take it a totally different direction just because

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.160
there's more of you on board.

01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:22.160
Right.

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:24.160
Yeah, but that's not what I'm talking about.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:28.800
I'm saying, I'm repeating what they have told me, some members of the community, that they

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.400
recognize that there's a lot of contributors.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:33.640
I don't even want to talk about users actually.

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:38.300
There's a lot of contributors who are coming in who are willing to send code upstream and

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:42.560
willing to participate, including our own engineers here who have been contributing

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.920
a lot to Unity as of late.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:50.400
And we're ready to provide code to solve some of the problems that they want to solve.

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:56.160
And they seem very, very open to working with us to solve what we want to solve.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:03.120
For instance, menus in GNOME, especially in applications, can be a mess.

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:08.200
There can be like three different menus in some applications in order to get to different

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.200
stuff.

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:11.640
This is one of the things that we're talking about addressing.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:18.400
And if we can't address it through GNOME proper, then we'll likely still address it.

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:19.760
Yeah, I agree with you.

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.920
And I think that one of the first things that struck me about using GNOME was finding this

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.480
menu inside of like the dock thing.

01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.640
So you know, that was interesting.

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:30.440
Monkey Comm, you wanted to chime in here.

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:37.080
Yeah, we, my company switched over to System76 systems probably two years ago, and we're

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:44.520
running servals and Meerkats and we're just running the stock System76 systems because

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:48.480
when my guys have problems, they call it System76.

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:56.080
And if they want to modify GNOME, but if they want to modify GNOME so that it makes a better

01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:01.360
presentation to my users and so I'm not having to go over and help them tweak their desktops,

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.120
I'm all on board because that's the whole reason we're using them.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.320
And that's a great point.

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:11.680
However, I have to ask the question, if the entire Linux community, you know, the entire

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:16.280
Linux community, but the major players in Linux being Red Hat, you know, and SUSE has

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:19.440
actually done a lot of contribution to GNOME as well.

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:24.240
So SUSE and Red Hat and Canonical, now they're all on GNOME and Mark Shuttleworth, the guy

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:29.400
with the vision of Unity, is willing to accept GNOME to ship as is.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.600
And what I'm hearing is, and I can't quite get over this, is System76 is now going to

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.680
kind of go out on their own and say, well, we'll make these extensions and kind of modify

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:37.680
and stuff?

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:38.680
Am I?

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:43.320
I like to be devil's advocate in this point, and if you look at it, System76 already went

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:46.560
out on their own with Unity and made modifications and things like that.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:51.960
So it's not like they're changing their MO, but mostly GNOME is designed specifically

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:57.300
to allow extensions, like it is intended to be modified via extensions.

01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:01.680
So even if you do install an extension or you create your own custom extension to modify

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.600
it in some way, are you really going against GNOME's, you know, intent?

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:12.920
Well, I think if GNOME wanted to include, you know, like the menu system, they wanted

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:16.160
to rework that, they wanted to include the minimize and maximize stuff.

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:19.720
I feel like that's something that was pretty simple that the GNOME team could have done

01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:24.460
long before, you know, Ubuntu switched over, System76 offered, you know, their engineers

01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:25.460
and stuff like that.

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:30.000
So I guess I'm just having a little hard time understanding how we are respecting the direction

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.120
that GNOME wants to go and what the decision is going to be if the direction GNOME wants

01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:41.320
to go is a different decision than what System76 feels is best for their customers.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.720
I would like to add two things here.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.840
One, you know, I'm basing this off of conversations with the GNOME guys.

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:51.360
They love the idea of making use of the extensions.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:57.080
Sorry, the GNOME guys I've talked to don't seem to mind the idea of the use of their

01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:02.880
extensions that they put into the desktop environment in order to make the changes that

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:03.880
we want to make.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:09.960
In fact, it seems like that's what they intended it for, was for the last bit, you know, if

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:13.840
it's an OEM or someone who wants to put in their own stuff to do that.

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:19.680
The other thing is we're, so I want everybody to take this with a grain of salt.

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:25.980
We are engineers to Guadec in Manchester this year, you know, that's a big GNOME conference.

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:32.200
And before we implement anything, we're going to be having conversations about, and I'm

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:37.240
fairly optimistic based on my conversations, of course, we made this decision before we

01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:45.600
had all the conversations we've had now, you know, that there's a lot that we can work

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:49.980
out without having to ship extensions.

01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:59.200
But I just, but the thing I'm trying to iterate here is that we are interested in implementing

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:05.080
our customers' feedback and we were waiting for a very long time.

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:09.680
And this is one of the downsides of canonical strategy before this change.

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.880
We were waiting for a long time because Unity 8 was coming and we thought, well, we could

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:18.600
pour all this time and money and resources into Unity 7 only to have it trashed, you

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:27.040
know, and now we realize, well, you know, there are things that our customers want that

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:34.260
ultimately we're going to have to either take into our own hands, you know, or not see them

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:37.920
at all potentially.

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:42.800
And just like I'm sure you listened to customer feedback and implemented it, you know, at

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:48.040
your role, so long as we do it in the right way, I feel like it will be a net positive

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.040
for everyone.

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:54.540
Of course, all this stuff will be made open and we'll provide it in a package that people

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:58.800
can easily install and have all of our extensions there.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:05.840
And we're just interested to really get involved into hacking around with Gnome, you know,

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.200
our new toy and see what we can do.

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:11.800
But all around, we're really excited about this and Gnome community has been fantastic.

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:15.800
Well, Ryan, we really appreciate you stopping by on Linux Unplugged and thanks a lot for

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.440
all you guys are doing at System76.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.360
We wish you the best.

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:23.680
I still have my reservations about how all this is going to play out, but I guess we'll

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:24.680
see.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.920
Wes, what are your thoughts?

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:30.040
You know, I think that's spot on.

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:35.920
I'm hopeful that it's going to be a good move for Linux desktop users overall.

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:39.320
You know, there was Mark Shuttleworth had some comments about what he thought about

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:42.800
the hate on Mir and Unity in general.

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:47.360
I do agree with you as someone who's used it at a work desktop, like I didn't, I did,

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.840
obviously I could change my desktop if I need to.

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:49.840
I didn't go that far.

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:50.840
It worked.

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:51.840
It worked for me.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.680
It wasn't when I chose on my home systems, but it was, you know, it was very functional.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.240
It had a lot of nice features that maybe other things didn't.

01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:01.920
But I'm very hopeful that we can take the energy that was going there, redirect it and

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:07.680
build a better foundation that we can all benefit from.

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:08.680
But we'll see.

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:10.000
I think we're going to have to see.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.960
That seems like a perfect time to end this week's program.

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:17.900
I think it's been a great discussion and something we're going to have to consider.

01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:23.760
So that wraps it up this week, episode 192 of your Linux Unplugged program.

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:27.280
If you'd like to see more, head on over to JupiterBroadcasting.com.

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:30.200
There you can find our reruns, other show reruns.

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.560
Hey, there's a new show called Ask Noah.

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:36.760
You should most certainly check out if you've enjoyed Noah's commentary here today, or if

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:40.240
you didn't because you're just going to get more of that wonderful guy.

01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:43.360
You can find me on Twitter at at Wes Payne.

01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.240
Noah, where are you?

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:50.600
At ColonelLinux at AskNoahShow, AskNoahShow.com for the Ask Noah dashboard.

01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:51.600
Excellent.

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:52.600
Well, thank you very much.

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:55.880
This show wouldn't be the same without all of our Wonder Mumble contributors.

01:31:55.880 --> 01:32:00.200
You can go to JupiterBroadcasting.com if you want to find out more about how to get on

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:02.920
our Mumble Room, or you can join us on our IRC.

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.520
We love having live contributors.

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:07.920
It's what makes this show the virtual mug.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.840
And please stay tuned.

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:39.800
Join us next week.

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:40.920
All right, everybody.

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:45.760
Let's go over to JBedTitles.com and pick our show title.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.560
So I got a bone to pick with something Colonel said.

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:49.560
All right.

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:50.560
Uh-oh.

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.640
That's the perfect opportunity for our post-show discussion.

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.640
Okay.

01:32:53.640 --> 01:33:03.040
So Noah, you mentioned something about developers' intentions and whatnot and the way that distributions

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:05.760
package the desktop environments.

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:12.960
But I always kind of see it as the distro's job to kind of smooth out those rough edges.

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:16.000
And Ubuntu's always done a really good job of that.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:24.560
Like in the past, even when they shipped GNOME 2, they really put a lot of polish on that.

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:25.560
I agree.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:27.040
Adding that top menu and stuff like that.

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:28.040
I agree.

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:33.240
And I think it's one thing for a large software company that ships hundreds of millions of

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:37.120
copies of a software that has 700 employees, offices in multiple locations to make that

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.720
kind of a change.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:43.180
And a computer company in Denver, Colorado that's in a single place, this is not a hit

01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.180
on System76.

01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:48.760
I have given more praise to System76.

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:53.040
They had the most airtime of any segment we did at scale because I was so in love with

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.280
the product that they're doing.

01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:56.560
So this is not a hit on System76.

01:33:56.560 --> 01:34:02.320
But the market confines of the reality that we're living in is that Canonical, a company

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:08.120
many, many times the size of System76 is saying that we think it's a better opportunity to

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:10.920
ship GNOME the way the GNOME team wants to deliver it.

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:14.240
And System76 is saying, no, we don't quite agree with that.

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:17.920
We think that we need to make these changes here, there, and everywhere, and we'll make

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.920
these kind of tweaks.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:21.840
And if we can't get it done through actual GNOME, then we'll just hack on an extension.

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:29.920
And that whole thing starts to make me feel like we are going down a path that I'm not

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:32.440
real comfortable going down.

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.720
If it was a hack on of changing some part of the core or something like that, then I

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.440
would agree with your point.

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:45.920
But the extension system is built by GNOME for this purpose.

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:52.160
The other part that I got from him describing what he was talking about as well is it sounded

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:58.920
like this was more minor tweaks with the extensions and theming, which a lot of OEM manufacturers

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:05.920
for computers, not only do they do that kind of thing, I've seen stuff on computers when

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:10.300
you get them new that you don't want that stuff on your computer.

01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:17.080
And I have more confidence in System76 making small changes than I'd say HP shipping me

01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:18.560
a brand new computer.

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.840
I agree with that.

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:25.520
But when it comes to redoing the menu system, when it comes to modifying the taskbar and

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:30.280
stuff like that, it seems like those are the kind of things that in my personal experience,

01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:33.920
and again, I'm not speaking for everyone, my personal experience, those kinds of things

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:40.560
done with extensions seem to leave little holes in the polish, and again, not to beat

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:41.560
a broken or a dead horse.

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.360
Well, that's because the extensions don't have people backing it.

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.640
They don't have a company backing to make sure that they are polished.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:52.800
And I'm wondering, does System76 have the infrastructure, do they have the capital,

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:57.520
do they have what's necessary to bring that forward?

01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.680
I don't know the answer to that.

01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.680
Maybe they do.

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.800
Maybe I'm solid, I'm short, I don't know.

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.640
So let's actually go and down this route a bit because like, okay, let's say that you're

01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:13.200
right and it leaves holes in the polish, wouldn't they then go and get some complaints and then

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:14.600
maybe they'd fix it?

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.160
I think that this is really not a problem.

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:21.000
I think we're getting hung up on only one stage of the pipeline because we're not looking

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.080
forward enough.

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.920
If there's problems, then people are going to notice it and they're going to complain

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:26.720
to them and they'll fix it.

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:28.600
I'm just looking bigger picture.

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:34.640
Canonical ships, Ubuntu, everyone that's using Ubuntu perfectly happy with Gnome, including

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.560
Mark Shuttleworth himself, and then not quite good enough for a single computer company

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.560
out of Denver.

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.600
I'm having a hard time squaring it in my head.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:45.240
Well, I don't think anyone leaves Gnome stock.

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:48.520
I don't think anyone installs Gnome.

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.820
According to Mark Shuttleworth, OMG Ubuntu ran a piece, they did an interview with him

01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:56.480
and in his words, we believe that the Gnome team is going to take direction.

01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:00.240
We're going to offer some input but ultimately, we're going to let them take the design decision.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:03.800
They will ship Gnome and we will just implement it.

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:06.640
They specifically asked him if he is going to be tweaking the stuff and according to

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.640
him, they're not.

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.640
They're just going to take Gnome.

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:12.360
Yeah, but I think he's out of the desktop business after Unity.

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.360
That's someone who's gone down six years of trying to do something and realize this is

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:19.140
too much of a nut to crack, we're going to go back to Gnome.

01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:20.320
That's really what that is.

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:23.840
It's not him saying that Gnome doesn't need improvement.

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:26.820
He's just saying, we'll let them worry about the desktop.

01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:29.440
We're going to worry about the Ubuntu Chronicle products.

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:32.920
I think this is a good way to segue.

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.280
What a great design idea.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:36.280
Let the Gnome team deal with the desktop.

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:40.520
Let us deal with the backend Ubuntu and I agree with that design philosophy and that

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:44.840
makes it all the more difficult for me to say that this computer company is going to

01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:48.960
say, well, it's good enough for all those people, not quite good enough for our customers.

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:51.960
That is what I have a hard time getting my head wrapped around.

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:56.360
Mostly because I spent the last week getting so excited that all of these companies are

01:37:56.360 --> 01:38:00.600
rallying around a single desktop environment and so that's going to become consistent between

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:04.440
Red Hat, Fedora, Ubuntu, Seuss, all of these companies.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:07.880
Everything is going to be consistent and now I feel like right at the beginning before

01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:13.480
we even have the first version out, we already have one of the biggest supporters of Ubuntu,

01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:17.680
one of the biggest shippers of Ubuntu laptops saying, we're going to go a slightly different

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:18.680
way.

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:20.840
We're going to do some little tweaks, but we're going to go a slightly different way.

01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:21.840
That's what kind of gets me.

01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:26.840
I think that chimes right in with what Rekai was asking.

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:30.280
And Rekai was saying he didn't really get an answer to his question, but did System

01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:36.000
76 really decide, should other companies decide that maybe KDE or Mate?

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.000
How about elementary OS?

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.760
They have one of the elementary OS designers at their company.

01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:46.320
That seems like a direction that could be a good way to go, particularly if they are

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:50.480
concerned that the gnome isn't going to adequately fit their customers.

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:54.520
You want something upstream that they're going to be receptive, especially if you're going

01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:58.160
to be willing to apply extra effort, submit patches, you want an upstream that's going

01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:00.600
to be taking them or iterate on them.

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:06.840
Going to elementary would be like, your argument as having a whole unified approach would be

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.480
the exact opposite.

01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:11.800
Why would you be okay with them choosing elementary versus adding some-

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:12.800
I'm not.

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:16.760
If it were up to me, I would ship stock Ubuntu.

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:19.840
But what I'm saying is if you're going to start making UI tweaks, if you don't feel

01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:24.040
like that's up to the task, and like Rekai correctly points out, they're at a point of

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:25.080
force change anyway.

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:28.600
I think if it were up to System 76, they'd continue shipping Unity because they've been

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.280
selling Unity for seven years.

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:33.280
They've been telling their customers to expect Unity for seven years.

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:37.040
Probably before this announcement was made, they were telling customers, one of the great

01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:39.840
things about it, because I know, because I've been telling my customers this, one of the

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:42.780
great things about Ubuntu is you won't have to worry about the desktop change because

01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:44.280
they don't make those big changes, right?

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:45.880
And then all of a sudden, boom.

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:51.320
Are you bothered by Intergos, Fedora, and SUSE all having different things from the

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:52.320
stock gnome?

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.320
Kind of.

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.320
None of them ship stock gnome.

01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.840
Fedora is pretty darn close.

01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:58.360
I mean, there really is not.

01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:01.120
They're the ones who even make it and they don't ship the stock.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.320
Don't forget to vote, everyone.

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.280
What's modified in Fedora?

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:10.200
They don't even modify the color template of the theme stuff.

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:11.200
That ship stuff.

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:12.200
That's because they designed it.

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.760
Yeah, they designed that part, but they also add extensions.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:18.760
There are official gnome extensions, such as the application menu.

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:24.680
If you don't like the default menu in the overview, gnome provides an extension for

01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:25.680
changing.

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.680
Fair enough.

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:30.820
I have a question here.

01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:37.080
Let's imagine that System76 does some changes and let's imagine they would present some

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:41.860
kind of pop-up menu and they would say, okay, you can do the change with Ubuntu.

01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:48.400
You can switch to gnome 3 or you can have some patch set, some extension set that we

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:54.680
provide for you and that will give some kind of legacy Unity experience for you.

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:56.800
Would that be a solution for you?

01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:57.800
Maybe.

01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:58.800
Maybe.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:06.120
I just, the whole thing is treating gnome like it is some golden goose that obviously

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:11.320
is making all the right design decisions and ultimately, that's the way you're describing

01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:12.320
it.

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:17.400
Here's an issue I have and I'll admit it's kind of a raw spot for me, but I see this

01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:18.560
happen time and time again.

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:22.480
What happens is something really cool starts off and at first, it's a bunch of geeks who

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:26.460
love it and then what happens is it kind of takes off and then they put a marketing term

01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:29.520
on it and then it gets sold to commercial ventures and then everyone jumps on board

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:34.440
and then they take this thing that all of these core geeks really liked and then they

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:38.020
take it in a direction that it was never meant to go in to begin with and I'm having a hard

01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:40.120
time coming up with something off the top of my head.

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:41.120
Home automation.

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.320
Home automation is a great example, right?

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.680
It started out as I had close contacts, I had relays, I owned all the technology, I

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:49.840
could fit all in my house, I could see it all, I could use it all.

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:50.840
Everything was open.

01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:51.840
There was no restrictions.

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:55.740
There was no proprietary stuff and then it got eaten up by these companies who marketize

01:41:55.740 --> 01:42:00.320
it and productize it and now you buy everything from Amazon, you link it to your Amazon account

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.820
with an API key and Amazon controls everything and then now everyone says, oh, I like home

01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:05.820
automation.

01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:06.820
Well, they don't like the home automation.

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:11.080
They like paying for Amazon services and that's what I'm kind of afraid of happening

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.080
to Gnome.

01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:16.440
The Gnome team has been consistently delivering a better and better and better desktop every

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:17.440
time it comes out.

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.440
Is it perfect?

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:19.440
No.

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:20.440
Do I like it for everything?

01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:21.440
Absolutely not.

01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:22.440
Do I have problems with it?

01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:26.400
Of course, but they are going a particular direction and the people that are using Gnome

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:30.080
are very happy with the direction they're going and what concerns me is as we all of

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:33.660
a sudden load up the millions of people that are on Ubuntu and now they're coming back

01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:38.280
into the Gnome projects as we load up these, you know, software, hardware manufacturers

01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:42.220
that are shipping to their end clients and they have to meet a profit line and they have

01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:45.200
to deliver to their customers and their customers' expectations.

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:50.100
My concern is does the direction of Gnome change or is there going to be a lot of undue

01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:53.900
pressure for the direction of Gnome change from all these people that are going to Gnome

01:42:53.900 --> 01:43:09.080
because the desktop they were on, frankly, wasn't good enough for the market.
