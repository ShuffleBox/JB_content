1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
I think we've got to talk about this. A new Dell XPS Ubuntu edition has shipped,

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,280
and I have a ton of respect for what our friends over at Dell have done with the Sputnik line,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,240
and I understand that they're just kind of revalidating and rebadging an existing product.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,600
There is an XPS 13 for Windows, but the XPS 13 Plus Developer Edition

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,160
has what they call a new radical look, and it seems that Dell's design team is about four years

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,040
behind Apple. We've got what is essentially a butterfly chiclet keyboard, the function

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:39,360
row has been replaced by touch LED lights, there's no escape key, and it has two ports, USB-C both.

8
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,120
Why? I think it was well proven that these things were not helpful for anyone.

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,200
I wonder what the meeting room was like that day.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,400
Right, after years of Apple getting grief from MacBook customers about the touch bar

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,880
and getting rid of the escape key, and then them specifically, after years,

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,440
reverting those changes, and just as they do that, Dell comes out with this, and I don't get it,

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,920
because it also feels like now is the worst time to mess this kind of thing up in this product

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,280
category. Dell essentially helped create part of this category with the Sputnik line,

15
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,920
along with others like System76. It was their game to lose. They were the largest

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,360
OEM. They were one of the best options for enterprises that wanted an Ubuntu system.

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,080
And with this, it feels like they're just ceding their market to their competitors with the Dev1

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,760
and the new Lemur and other laptops, like lots of Linux laptops now, some directly from

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,840
distributions. Is this maybe a signal that even with the seemingly good support that the community

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,800
has shown for adopting Sputnik, for doing reviews, for talking about it on entertainment and

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,760
educational shows, that it's still a relatively small signal compared to whatever signals they

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,880
think, you know, the folks who are setting the direction for this whole line are receiving up

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,440
the chain? Because as you say, right, like the good side of this is they're committed to making

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,600
a Linux version of what they're selling. The bad side is it doesn't seem like what Linux users

25
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:29,040
might want is exactly factoring up into what that product looks like. Hello, friends, and welcome

26
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,560
back to your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Les, and my name is Brent.

27
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,920
Hello, gentlemen, coming up on the show today, we're going to take a sleeper distro. Maybe

28
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,000
you've heard of but never really looked at packed full of modern Linux technologies,

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,960
even though it has kind of a more traditional long term support release cycle. And it is also

30
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,600
the final distribution in our summer of a mutable Linux journey. And it is fittingly endless OS.

31
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,720
An old friend is going to join the show in a little bit and go deep into endless OS with us.

32
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,920
Plus, today is the day we are pulling names from our JPL hat to determine who is actually going to

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,160
join us for our JPL tour. Then we'll round out the show with some boosts, some picks,

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,880
and a lot more. So before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to our

35
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,280
virtual lug. Hello, Mumble Room. Good morning. Hello, Chris. Hey, Brent, and hey, Wes.

36
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
Hello, you guys. Hello. Hello.

37
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,920
Great to see you in there. Plus, I think a record setter for our quiet listening room

38
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,960
in weeks as we transition our mainstream over to our PeerTube instance at jupyter.tube. I

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,320
think a lot of people are saying, hey, you know what I want? I want a high quality

40
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,640
Opus stream that's super low latency. And then go get Mumble. And then you have Mumble set up

41
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,680
for other stuff as well. So welcome in, everybody. Also, a big good morning to Tailscale. Our

42
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,720
friends over at tailscale.com have created a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

43
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,000
It's like peak WireGuard implementation, the kind of thing you hope somebody would build when we

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,520
first started talking about WireGuard. It's here, and it's a game changer. Go build a mesh network

45
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,200
just for yourself using Tailscale. Go say good morning and get it for free up to 20 devices

46
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,080
at tailscale.com. So this week, Gnome launched a new telemetry program to help, quote,

47
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,400
improve Gnome. We've talked about data collection before on the show with mixed opinions, I think,

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,600
from the virtual lug and from your hosts. Gnome has created this tool directly. It's not preinstalled

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,280
on any distribution or with any version of Gnome. It collects your Linux distro and its version

50
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,000
obviously, your hardware OEM model CPU, et cetera, that it can kind of grok from the system.

51
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,320
It checks to see if you have Flatpak, and if you do, if FlatHub is enabled.

52
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,720
It looks to see what applications in Gnome are pinned to the dock, you know, your favorites

53
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,600
in Gnome. It checks to see what Gnome extensions you have installed. I think we should come back

54
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,560
to that. And it checks to see what your default browser is. It's called Gnome Info Collect,

55
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
and it's out there right now for anyone who wants to grab it and run it on their own system.

56
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,120
They've got SUSE packages available, Arch package available, Fedora package available,

57
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,200
and a SNAP available. I don't know. I'm curious to know what you think, guys. But this seems to me

58
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,480
like perhaps the best compromise we have seen yet of this information collected. It's voluntary.

59
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,560
You have to go get it yourself in the download page where you go to get it. They tell you what

60
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,520
they're collecting. Wes, you gave it a go before the show. I did, although, you know, I thought

61
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,320
I'd try to be a little bit of a troll and try it out on a plasma system. It was too smart for that,

62
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,520
though. So, yeah, no dice. You got to run it from a Gnome system. But it's super simple. I really

63
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,760
like that. It's just a little Python app. They do ask for some help getting it packaged. So if

64
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,840
those are skills you have, maybe go take a look. But it's really easy to run. It doesn't have a

65
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,960
ton of dependencies. And, of course, it's all open source, seemingly including the bits that

66
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,440
run the server. Oh, that's an interesting observation. I wasn't aware of that. I notice

67
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,160
it's not yet packaged for Nix. Though I think someone in our Nix nerds matrix chat room did

68
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,480
create a flake for it, right? Looking at you, Kenji. That's great, Kenji. Thank you. Brent,

69
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,680
how do you feel about this stuff? I know you're probably one of the more privacy-conscious ones

70
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,400
on the show. This is pretty voluntary. It doesn't come pre-shipped, although I actually think it'd

71
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,080
be more beneficial if it did. And at the end of the Gnome setup wizard, it asks you to collect

72
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,640
this info because you're going to get such a tiny skewed demo that downloads and tries this. But

73
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,600
is this just the compromise we have to make? Well, I think having a choice is actually really

74
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,080
refreshing. We've talked about this several times in the past, I think. But to have it be

75
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,720
written in a language and be open source, so at least if you're really interested, you can go see

76
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,200
what's happening. And that they're so upfront about what's being collected, I think, is really

77
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,200
helpful. And that, to me, even feels like, OK, well, if that's what they're looking for, I could

78
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,120
see from a developer's point of view how useful that might be for them to target certain systems

79
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,000
and certain applications and user interfaces and stuff like that. So I think it's really just the

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,680
transparency that's helpful. If you know what they're collecting and you think it's helpful

81
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,080
and you want to help in that way, and that's a good way for you to help, then I don't see why

82
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,320
this is harmful in any way. So I would say, let it be a choice. And let them be upfront about it

83
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,720
in the installer, too. It's helpful. I am almost hesitating to really say this, but it's happening.

84
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,720
As Gnome becomes feature complete, or they settle on the features they want to support,

85
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,320
doesn't it seem natural that they would look towards extensions and what extensions their

86
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,120
community are using the most and then seeing if they have a way they could just safely build that

87
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,760
into Gnome itself? And so one of the things that jumped out at me on this is they're checking to

88
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,040
see what extensions are installed on a Gnome system. And I think that could be a significant

89
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,360
data point for them. In my personal opinion, I think for a long time, there's been a culture

90
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,880
of underplaying extensions for some of the Gnome developers. And so getting data like this,

91
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,800
where you're going to see there is some consistent extensions, and I can just tell this is, you know,

92
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,920
I've been using Gnome very consistently since Gnome 3.12. I took a break for a little while,

93
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,080
but came back around 3.12. And I've always had it on some of my systems since then. And you can

94
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,440
tell if anybody who's been running it for this long, you can look at the extension page, you can

95
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,600
see what developers update after Gnome release, you can sort by popularity, you get an idea of

96
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,480
which ones are getting feedback. And you can tell some of those extensions are probably on like 80%

97
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,200
of Gnome systems out there. They're just maybe pre-installed by a distro maker. So it'd be great

98
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,040
for them to get that signal. And you got to appreciate that, you know, of course, like all

99
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,840
open source projects, Gnome has limited time and resources. So I like how they framed some of this

100
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,040
data collection around like, how much should we be investing in static workplaces? Are people using

101
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,880
them? Now, obviously, there's some issues around folks with installs that aren't going to configure

102
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,080
this and how this all plays out. But it seems reasonable to sort of say like, hey, this is an

103
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,560
easy way for you to help shape the future of the software you're using. There's also the possibility

104
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,960
that somebody like me who does like static workspace on my secondary screens and a moving

105
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,200
workspace on my main screen, that's been working really well for me. Maybe I'm the only person that

106
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,520
uses that. And so they decide by the data, they're going to take that away and I'll be sad. So I

107
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,880
should prepare myself for that kind of thing. Go install it on more systems, maybe. Yeah, I'll go

108
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,840
spin up 30 VMs. Dan, you were pointing out that Plasma is doing something similar as well, right?

109
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:12,960
Yeah, they have the KUserFeedback thing that is incorporated. So I probably knew that,

110
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,560
but I think I just totally forgot about KUserFeedback. But I'm glad. I'm glad they have it.

111
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,960
Yeah, it's set to disabled by default, but you can increase the amount of information you want

112
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,880
to give them. I'm all for it. Volunteer the information you want on the systems you don't

113
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,360
want on the grid. Don't install these tools. Don't use these tools. It's a really nice compromise.

114
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,680
Kenji brought up another point that's worthwhile, I think maybe is, are we going to get to see these

115
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,000
stats down the road? So like all the stuff to collect it is open, but what kind of is it going

116
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,880
to be just internal to the GNOME team or is it going to be published in some way? I didn't see

117
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,960
any answers about that, although I didn't do a ton of searching admittedly. That's a great question.

118
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,840
I hadn't even thought of that. I'd like to know. Why not? I bet they will. I'll read through,

119
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,600
I'll read through their GitHub post and see if they say it. I actually don't recall them addressing

120
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,760
it, but it looks like, you know, if the backend is open source, they're being really transparent

121
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:10,400
about all of this. I wouldn't be too surprised if we see that. Now we're doing a little cleaning

122
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,880
right here at the top of the show, so we got some housekeeping for you. Big updates for our West

123
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:23,120
Coast meetups. The venues are in and with a little bit of planning, it turned out that we're going to

124
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,160
breweries for all of them. It's a brewery tour and they're all incredible. Every single venue looks

125
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,960
fantastic. And this is a big thank you to our West Coast crew. Our matrix room helped my wife

126
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:45,280
Adia narrow down all of the best possible venues. So if you're in Southern Oregon area, and I hope

127
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,080
even nearby, if you're in the Sacramento area, if you're in the Southern California area, if you're

128
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:56,720
in the Portland area, we've got meetups for you. We've got swag ordered. We have geo caches we'll

129
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,560
be deploying. It's getting really set up, guys. And I've been working for about three weekends straight

130
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,240
on just getting Jup's road ready. She's going to be looking sharp when you see her. She'll be

131
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,240
nearby at some of these places. So go sign up. We need to know if you're coming or not so we can

132
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,560
start telling the venues how many people to expect. Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for that.

133
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:26,960
And then get in that West Coast crew chat room. That's bit.ly slash West Coast crew. It's pretty easy.

134
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,040
I thought it should be West Coast crew with no tea, but you know, I got outvoted. Yeah,

135
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,320
get get the West crew in there. You know, get the West crew representing. I feel like that might be

136
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,800
the the Knicks nerds chat room. I bet they're a bunch of Oh, maybe I bet they're a bunch of West

137
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:49,520
fans. All right, well, so now before we get into our main topic today, we've been waiting weeks

138
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,880
to pull the names out of the hat to see who will go to JPL. Wes has run the scripts.

139
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:06,320
All right, here we go. Coming in right now. We have a chosen few. I'll just I'll say first names,

140
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,920
but we'll be reaching out via email as well. Michael J, you are in. Fern, you are in.

141
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,760
Valdall? Why you gotta do me like that? You're in. AJS, you're in. Greg, you are in. Oliver T is in.

142
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:28,080
Anyone Andrew, you're in. Joshua M is in. Bloodpath, you're in. I look forward to telling JPL that

143
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,600
Bloodpath will be attending. That'll be good. This is what we got when we allowed handles for

144
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:40,160
submissions, but it seems natural for our community. Mikey G, you are in. Tyler L, you are in. Eric P,

145
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,640
you are in. Jonathan M, you are in. David H, you are in. And Mr. Optimus Gray is in.

146
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,280
We have a few others we may be reaching out to directly as well, because I didn't see Jeremy's

147
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,480
name in this list, but we do have a slot for listener Jeremy who wrote in too. Oh yeah,

148
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,200
these were just the ones that were, you know, right. Rando picked right there. Boom. Very good.

149
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Congratulations, everybody. Thank you so much for signing up. We hope to see you there.

150
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,080
Well, you better come because you committed. But you are the chosen few. You check the box. If you

151
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,160
can't just no, no hard feelings. Just let us know as soon as you find that out. We've got some

152
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,720
reserve names that we will draw from in the event that happens. Yep. So if you didn't hear your name

153
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,600
called, you are probably then on the reserve list. That was neat. That worked out really well. Again,

154
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,520
we used our next cloud instance to do this. So it's all using a free software stack. And then

155
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Wes used some tools we'll talk about in a little bit in the show to sort of sort everything out

156
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,280
and parse it. But there you go. Oh, my gosh. That's a big moment. We actually have our list

157
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:47,200
of JPL tour attendees. It's real. It's real now. I got an email from Tim a couple of days ago,

158
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,840
which I got to get back to. It said, hey, what's your schedule?

159
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:56,960
So we had to get we had to get this done, right? We had to figure this out. So we got it figured

160
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,240
out and hopefully we got it with enough time everybody can get their travel plans in. But

161
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,960
like Wes said, if you can't, you can contact the show Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact or

162
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,160
reach out to myself or Wes and let us know when we can slot someone else in on that list.

163
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,320
Leno dot com slash unplugged. Go there to get one hundred dollars and sixty day credit on a

164
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,720
new account and you go there to support the show. Linode makes cloud computing simple, affordable

165
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,160
and accessible. It's fast and reliable. It's the best hosting in the business. Real humans

166
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,840
every day can help you. And it's what we've used for every project we've built and deployed in

167
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:38,080
the cloud for nearly three years now. It's really powerful. It's fast. Eleven data centers around

168
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,800
the world and they have an interface that everyone on our team can interact with at their own skill

169
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,720
level. Like you can use back end automation tools, which I really appreciate, or you can

170
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,520
use their really simple cloud dashboard, their API, their command line tool. There's a lot there

171
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,160
and it's made it really possible for us to work collaboratively on this new website that, yeah,

172
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,160
we're deploying on Linode. Where else would we deploy something like this? And of course,

173
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,520
Linode also has that S3 compatible object storage, that object storage, which I just absolutely

174
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,480
love. You put it all together with the performance, the support, and then it really seals the deal

175
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,320
with the pricing. They're 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there,

176
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,080
but better than that, guys. This is the model you want. This is the model where you get a Linux box

177
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,800
where you can SSH into a Linux box and you actually get root access and you can control

178
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,760
the system, right? The hyperscalers, it's all abstracted away from you with their esoteric

179
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,600
language and their esoteric names and their esoteric interface. And God, I like saying

180
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,760
esoteric because it's so true for those different, I don't know, I'll just call them hyperscalers.

181
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,080
I won't start swearing, but you know how I feel about it. Like that is not the future that I

182
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,000
want to see. I mean, I'm glad that's a product for some people, but I want Linux systems that

183
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,280
I can get access to, I can install the packages, I can manage. That's my infrastructure and that's

184
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,160
the model Linode is continuing to make awesome and excellent. And they're doing it with the

185
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,800
best performance, the best support and 11 data centers for you to choose from. Go build something,

186
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,840
go learn something, try it for yourself and support the show. That $100 really lets you try it.

187
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:14,960
Linode.com slash unplugged. One more time. Go support the show and try it out. Linode.com slash

188
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:23,520
unplugged. Back home baller. Damn straight y'all. Yeah, that's right. It's time for some baller

189
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:32,960
boosts. First up from Tecario with 30,000 Satoshis. Cause I'm a back home baller. If I want

190
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,240
something I just holler. A long time listener crashed your mumble server at one time with

191
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,640
emojis. Hey, ouch. Hey now, but thanks for owning up to it anyway. Just want to say thanks for

192
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,680
putting this together week after week. It's been a great journey and this is the one podcast I have

193
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,360
always looked forward to for years now. Keep it real. Hey, you keep it real Tecario. We really

194
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,520
appreciate you. Yeah, thank you TC. That's amazing. Your baller boost also helped put us on one of

195
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:07,360
the top boosted lists for the Fountain.fm podcast player. So thank you very much. We didn't get a

196
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,960
ton of boosts this week, but this definitely made up for it. So thank you very much.

197
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:21,200
We got the boosts that mattered. Speaking of, here's a boost from our friend Gene Bean with 13,370

198
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,400
Satoshis. Cause I'm a back home baller. Oh, you might be interested in this one Chris. Gene Bean

199
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,120
writes, I think I found a good meetup.com alternative. He does know you can hit him

200
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,520
up on matrix if you want some more details, but the short version I asked around on the

201
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,080
Faustodon Mastodon server and got a lot of good feedback about Mobiles on. I don't know how to

202
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,120
say that. Mobiles on and a few other services though. Mobiles on seem like the best fit for

203
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,920
your guys possible needs. I did a little bit of time looking into this and it looks like it's a

204
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:00,560
free Libre and open source software set maintained by the same folks behind PeerTube from a soft.

205
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,080
What? Really? Oh, lovely. How do we not know about this? I wonder if it's like a play on

206
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,400
mobilization. I think it's French. So I'm sure I A said it wrong and B we're missing

207
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:17,680
several layers of nuance. Mobiles on. Oh, oh, Brent knows it. Yes, I do. I have the French tongue.

208
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,360
I got to say I've legit never heard of this. I've heard of some of the others like get together and

209
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,080
whatnot. Never seen this. So this is super interesting. I really appreciate that. I will

210
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,720
definitely take a look at that. Have you guys ever heard of this one? No, but it's got it's got

211
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,800
a nice website and yeah, it might be might be worth a look. That's great. Well, thank you very much.

212
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,640
If you'd like to send us a boost, you can get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com. What we're

213
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,760
doing now is we're splitting out the the baller boosts from the regular boosts. I guess we

214
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,160
appreciate all of them. But what we're doing is for the last half of the show towards the end of

215
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,920
the show, we're going to pivot to just boost quality. The signal is what we'll choose for

216
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,680
which boosts make it into the show. So we have a special spot to thank the people who are helping

217
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,960
support the show directly with the baller boosts. And then later on in the show for the feedback

218
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,160
section, any boost is welcome. It just has to meet a certain threshold of signal, I suppose.

219
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,760
I don't like that. I don't want to make that sound bad, though. But I hope you get what we mean.

220
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,760
Just trying to keep it tidy. We can only read so many. Thank you, Boost. But they mean a lot to us.

221
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,280
We just have to edit for the show sometimes. That's basically it. We read them all and we

222
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,520
appreciate them all. All right, guys, let's talk about Endless OS. Endless was founded in 2012 in

223
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,720
San Francisco, California, by Matthew Dalio and Marcelo Sampeo. And then in April of 2015,

224
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,000
it probably got on all of our radar. I know we covered it at JV when they launched a Kickstarter.

225
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,440
They raised one hundred and seventy six thousand dollars with one thousand and forty one backers

226
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,320
in less than 30 days. And initially, they were really going to focus on hardware. Over the years,

227
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,120
they've pivoted more to focusing just on the software. On April 1st, 2020, Endless became

228
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:00,160
a nonprofit organization known as the Endless OS Foundation. Endless is based on Debian,

229
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,920
roughly, with a whole lot of customizations. It is an immutable OS based on OS tree

230
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:11,200
and a lot of flat packs. And we wanted to kick the tires and see if this was the implementation

231
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,560
truly designed for a workstation, for end users, maybe for family, for an office setting.

232
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,480
Brent, why don't we start with your experience? Yeah, I was really excited to try Endless. I've

233
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,720
heard about it for years. I think it was back in like 2018. I started poking my eyes on it and

234
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,480
keeping track of it. And they're doing a bunch of really neat stuff around education and outreach

235
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,880
to, you know, countries that don't have super fast Internet. So they've got a bunch of really

236
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,480
neat features around that. So that that's what got me interested at first. And I knew,

237
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,920
oh, I know you too. And I figured you'd focus on the technical bits. So I thought, well,

238
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,280
I'm just going to approach this from a usability and sort of user friendliness standpoint. And

239
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,080
I think you both know I'm pretty good at that. So things were going pretty well. I, unfortunately,

240
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:05,520
though, started running into a few frustrating issues. I'm here testing Endless OS and feeling

241
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:12,720
some frustrations. I really want to like Endless OS. There's some really nice stuff about it and

242
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,320
some well thought out sections. But I'm running into some performance issues, which I never

243
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:27,680
expected. I was originally running it in a virtual machine on my ThinkPad X250. And it was running

244
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,840
kind of slow. And I thought, OK, I'm going to give it a good chance. So I pulled out my workstation

245
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:40,640
and installed it on an SSD, internal SSD, because I thought, I'm going to give it the best chance

246
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:49,280
possible. And I'm running into some issues. So there's, in particular, I think, a great example

247
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,760
of how frustrating this is, is there's one of the 12 icons that appears in the launcher. It's called

248
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,520
system, which is a little bit confusing. I thought it was going to be like system information or

249
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,600
something like that. It ends up being, which I think is also great, ends up being a teaching

250
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:14,880
tool for computer internals. And it's graphically cartoony and looks kind of fun. But it just brings

251
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,960
the entire system to a halt. The graphics are super glitchy. Whenever you move the mouse,

252
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:28,320
one of the cores on my CPU, which has six, it's not a slouch of a computer. I guess it's an AMD

253
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:36,400
Phenom 21075T. Graphics are AMD RS 880. So it's an old thing. It's got eight gigs of RAM. It's an

254
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,200
old thing, but not a slouch by any means. And one of the processors just get pegged whenever you

255
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,520
have this thing open and you're scrolling your mouse around it. But it also just

256
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,280
brings the entire system to a halt, to the point where it feels like I'm running this

257
00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:02,880
on a Raspberry Pi or something. And that is so frustrating. It is like the slowest experience

258
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,040
that I've had in a long time. And maybe it's just that application, but it seems like the whole

259
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:15,040
system just, oh, comes to a halt. Just wasn't performing the way you wanted there, eh, Brent?

260
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:20,000
Yeah. And to be fair, I think it was that particular application that was causing

261
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,160
that issue. Unfortunately, it was the very first icon I clicked on when I, when I booted

262
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,240
endless for the first time. So, uh, because I thought, oh, that looks interesting.

263
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,280
Yeah, I did. I did pretty similar too. And it, it just kills the performance. It's just,

264
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,480
yeah. Yeah. And I don't know why that is because they have another application called hack, which is

265
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:47,120
a teaching tool for coding. And it's, it has a very similar feel to it in terms of like the graphics,

266
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,040
uh, that are presented as a user interface. And yet it seemed to perform perfectly. So there,

267
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,720
there's gotta be something there and maybe it's fairly trivial for them to address that.

268
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,640
And I don't think it's necessarily a perfect representation of the rest of the experience,

269
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,520
but I have to say it took, it took the whole experience down several notches for me because I

270
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,400
just, well, it just, it just wasn't great. But there were some other things that I really loved

271
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,160
like, um, the login screen was super simplistic, but had a ton of accessibility options, like more

272
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,760
than I even knew existed, which I think maybe considering their audience, uh, they're trying

273
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,160
to make it as inclusive as possible. So that was really cool to see, but I did run into a bunch of

274
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,160
other paper cuts and I'll, I'll be curious to hear your experiences. Like, you know, my internet

275
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,760
isn't very fast here in my little cabin. Yes, I'm back home everyone. Hello, Canada. So I thought,

276
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,600
okay, I'm going to try their metered selecting my wifi as a metered connection. I just thought,

277
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,960
well, see what happens. And I got some weird things happening. Like one of the, one of the

278
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,120
things that happened in the software updater was that it suggested it was downloading the newer

279
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,000
version of endless OS. Uh, the installer I had was a little bit of an outdated version. So it

280
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,360
suggested it was downloading, but it never would, nor could I cancel it and nor could I kick it off,

281
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,160
you know, on purpose. And so that was my intention with using the metered connection was like, well,

282
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,920
I don't want things to download in the background because I have some productivity that I want to

283
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,600
get done and downloading huge ISOs or whatever sometimes can take an hour or two here. I'm sure

284
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,480
that's an easy fix as well, but was just another one of those. Oh, it's not quite where I want it

285
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,760
to be. And I ran into something similar to with just trying to set a shortcut key for the terminal.

286
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,280
I was just looking to set a keyboard shortcut and, you know, it acts asks for what the terminal

287
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,640
application name is that you want to run. And so I right clicked on the terminal and went,

288
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,680
Oh, which terminal is this? And, uh, it opened up the software center and just says, Oh, sorry,

289
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,880
there's no details for this application. So there was a bunch of these little things that just

290
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,440
started getting to me. No dark mode. I know, I know it's an old gnome version and I'm sure there's

291
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,720
a, uh, an add on, uh, that I can do to get a dark mode. But that was, uh, hopefully they

292
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:07,200
get that with a newer version of, of gnome when, when they update that. So I think I didn't ever

293
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,320
run into any issues with the underlying OS and the technologies there and updating when I did

294
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,040
happen was super smooth and most of the interface was exactly as you expect. But I, in the end,

295
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,080
found all these little tiny paper cuts just kind of deflated my excitement to try it out,

296
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,240
which I feel is very unfortunate. And I hope maybe in a year or so, maybe that'll be a little

297
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,760
bit different, but I'm curious to hear, uh, what you thought, Chris. So I came at it from a,

298
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:42,640
could this work for my kids standpoint? Because I like the idea of an immutable distro for the kids.

299
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,280
Just the other day, some updates installed on Fedora 36, and now I'm having trouble getting

300
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:55,200
Dylan's Nvidia card to work at all. Oh boy. Like the system, it sees it when I LSPCI and

301
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,000
it's clearly there, but then like nothing I can do now to get the driver to actually work is

302
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,080
happening. And I just think to myself like, well, the primary job of this computer is to play games

303
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,720
for him really. And it'd be nice if I could just have rolled that back. And so an immutable system

304
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,920
does seem really appealing. And I don't think a lot of the stuff that you hit would really bother

305
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,000
him to be honest with you, it would bother my son, Dylan. I think most of that, it would probably

306
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,640
be unnoticed by him. But as I was setting it up, there were a few things I observed that I just

307
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,760
thought were kind of interesting. Like, uh, and I know you saw this one too, but just like one of

308
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,800
the absolutely most unique EULAs I have ever seen in a Linux distro. I don't think the last one's

309
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,000
the last time we commented on the EULA, right? It's true. Yeah. Right. I did read it. I think

310
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,400
you spent half your time with endless just stuck in the EULA Brent. If, uh, if your Slack messages

311
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,600
to me were any cute, that's endless EULA. Yeah. Well, they have like sections highlighted and

312
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,720
stuff like, make sure you see this. I'm like, okay, that's wow. They're really drawing your

313
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,160
attention. And it seems like it's a PDF embedded into the installer too. Yeah. I had a hard time

314
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,200
reading it actually on, on the monitors that I have here, just the way it was scaling the PDF

315
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,840
and then it would bound it as well. So I couldn't zoom in enough to really get it legible in a way

316
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,600
that I was, I wanted it was so it could use a bit of work, I think. But you did click agree,

317
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,160
right? Just so we know if you've, uh, yeah, I read it, I read it first and then, uh,

318
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,200
I read it first and then the three of us had about 30 minutes of conversation back and forth

319
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,560
about it. And then I hit accept. Yeah, we did. We did discuss it quite a bit. Uh, I actually like

320
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,920
the way they've done the primary icons for launcher. It has a very iPad OS kind of feel,

321
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,040
including the folders in which icons, uh, hide out in. So unlike most distros, which are turning

322
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,640
off desktop icons these days, endless comes with hack, which is what Brent was talking about in

323
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,280
sidetrack, which are those interesting heavy apps. And it comes with chromium as its default browser

324
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,080
and an app center and rhythm box, you know, shot well video, bunch of stuff, right? But it's on

325
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,080
the desktop, like spring pad or whatever springboard, they call it on iOS. It looks

326
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,480
like that. And then of course there is more applications installed and it has a launch bar.

327
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,680
It, and as a search to run your thing. So if you want, you can just, and it's a search and enter

328
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:09,200
to launch kind of thing. And I think all of that would work really, really well for most new users.

329
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,960
In fact, I would argue that's probably for, for new users or average users. That's probably the

330
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,760
most accessible desktop launcher setup I've seen in a long time. I think they nailed that. And I

331
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,960
don't think it's how most like a pro Linux users like it. It's clearly not how upstream GNOME does

332
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,520
things, which is interesting considering endless's relationship with GNOME, which we'll get to more,

333
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,080
but yet it's how they're doing things. I think the technological appeal to endless OS

334
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,840
is OS tree. Also they integrate flat packs at a level deeper than I've seen any other distribution.

335
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,120
Like when the system's booting up and you clear the splash screen and you just look at the services

336
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,160
starting, you'll see a ton of stuff is actually flat pack stuff, even at the lower level of the

337
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,840
system. I've never seen it integrated that low before. I'll talk about that more with Cassidy.

338
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,640
And it's hard to mess up because of all of these things, because of the flat pack and because of

339
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,440
the immutable nature. It also means that if it's not right, it's harder to tweak it to make it right.

340
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:12,160
But if it's working out of the box and it works for you, it'll pretty much stay that way. That is

341
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,720
really nice. I think the number one thing I hate is when I give a family member Linux and then they

342
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:23,360
come back to me in about three months and something broke. And I just find that intolerable. And so

343
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,720
I think this would prevent those kinds of things. And then ultimately it's easy to use.

344
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,840
It's obvious. I think anyone who has any familiarity with a computer at all could use

345
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,640
Endless OS. And not all distributions strike that balance. So I don't know if I love it. I think

346
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,840
I prefer seeing what GNOME's doing now. I want the newer stuff now. I already want GNOME 43, right?

347
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,840
So Endless just isn't really a distribution for me. But I don't think Dylan cares what version of

348
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,640
GNOME he gets as long as files works, as long as he can use the system. He doesn't care what version

349
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,560
of GNOME it is. He just wants it to be nice. He wants it to look modern. He wants it to be nice.

350
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,720
He sees dad set up and he wants it to look cool like dad set up. So dark mode would be helpful.

351
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,440
What about you, Wes? A few things stand out from what you guys said. One, yeah, the flat pack

352
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,600
implementation is just really nice. And that, to me, it led me down this train of thought here of

353
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,960
I can't really think of the last time I saw a Linux distribution that felt this productized,

354
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,160
and not in a bad way, just like very thoughtfully designed, clearly that these elements have been

355
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:32,800
selected and worked on and honed over the long number of years now that Endless has been around

356
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,320
to try to get this experience. I think maybe there's some questions around if that's really

357
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,440
the experience like you and I and Brent want for our systems because we're so used to sort of

358
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,680
taking all these bits, especially with something, you know, talking of immutability playing with

359
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:53,200
with Nix, where we're building our own custom systems from whole cloth, basically. Endless is

360
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,840
kind of on the opposite end of the spectrum. But what they've done is it's just really impressive.

361
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,680
And like you're talking about, you know, Dylan, I'm thinking kind of the reverse here. I'm thinking

362
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:07,840
my mom, you know, she's on a older 1804, 20 or four, either way, I need to do some updates,

363
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,080
a Monte system. I think I might just try Endless next for her. I could see that being a pretty

364
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,480
trouble free OS in that situation. I did find it a little funny to get started with. I do want to

365
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,480
give them a lot of credit for having a lot of different images available. I really enjoyed that

366
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,960
they had like a VMDK image. If you just want to try it out in a virtual machine, no fuss. They've

367
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,240
got Raspberry Pi, they've got pine stuff. They've got like a lot of different ARM versions. But

368
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,240
that also means you have a ton of different things to pick from. And you're like, well,

369
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,640
do I want this multi language? And like, they've got these minimal base versions, but then he's

370
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:48,000
also really fat, like 16 gig downloads if you want all the stuff baked in. But unless you spend

371
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,840
enough time sort of reading all the verbiage to understand what those options are and mean,

372
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,400
I don't know, I could I could see not getting the image I want. And then I was also just a

373
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,200
little surprised that you end up getting a dot torrent file instead of your ISO or

374
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,840
IMG. Yeah, I'm fine with that. I'm fine with that. But is the average endless user fine with that?

375
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,080
I don't know. I don't want to presume. But that's the end. That's where I have some questions. I'd

376
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,720
be I'd be real curious to learn more because on one hand, torrent files are kind of, you know,

377
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,520
kind of arcane if you're not a if you're not a nerd, downloading a lot of ISOs or other content.

378
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,960
But at the same time, you could see where you know, some of the use cases that endless is trying

379
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,200
to fit here. Maybe you don't have access to fancy CDNs, but you could see where you could

380
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,280
maybe you don't have access to fancy CDNs. But you do have a local community or a local school

381
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:38,000
or few organizations in a country that have these distributed. And that's where something like

382
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,360
torrents might really shine. Yeah, I could also see though, in school networks torrents being

383
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,240
totally blocked. You know, you just in a university, I could see them blocking torrent downloads.

384
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,880
You know, West to add to your confusion, I found that there were certain downloads of a certain

385
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:59,520
version of endless os at endless os.com. And then there were a few places at endless os.org, where

386
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:07,280
I think more of the development happens where I found more updated versions like 4.0 dot eight,

387
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,880
I think it is is the most recent and I was a little confused. I guess on the homepage, maybe

388
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:18,320
that's their like super stable, you know, 4.0 release. And that's what they're putting out

389
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,040
there. But if you I was trying to get the latest and greatest version, and I, I found like three

390
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,680
different places to get different versions that I thought was a little bit confusing. And the one

391
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,960
that they put it endless.org, they actually lead with a Windows installer version. Oh, that's

392
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,280
fascinating. Yeah, there's a lot more to play with here. I gotta say like, I don't think I've

393
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,880
finished my playing around with endless OS. I mean, as you say, right, they've got this whole

394
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,040
option to like, just install it alongside Windows, I definitely the next time I'm feeling up to

395
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,040
actually doing a fresh Windows install, I'd like to try that alongside. And then as you mentioned,

396
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,280
like they've got Raspberry Pi support. And I just I just want to see how that hangs together.

397
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,720
Yeah, it is it makes for a confusing set of download options. But I guess, you know, it's nice

398
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,600
to have those options. So either way, for an enthusiast, it's fine. I wonder how the cycle

399
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,400
for users are most endless users, you know, sort of setting this up for themselves? Or is it

400
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,120
something, you know, more institutional, where, you know, someone can get these ISO files on the

401
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,000
back end, maybe they're not even a computer expert, but they know enough to sort of get these

402
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,760
files going and start flashing laptops with them and hand them out? Because it seems like once you

403
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,760
get past that first phase, then yeah, I think we've all kind of thought like, Oh, yeah, I'm not

404
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,440
gonna be able to break this very easily. Or at least, you know, less knowledgeable Linux users

405
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,560
certainly won't. I think our buddy Cass will speak to that a bit. But I got a I got a vague sense

406
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,160
when talking to him kind of like, where their market is now for that kind of thing. And I think

407
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,600
it's probably a lot of pre installed, like somebody else's installing it for them. Yeah,

408
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:48,400
that makes sense. And, you know, really here, we're not experts, we're just kind of dabbling,

409
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,640
we've done our whole summer of immutability. Endless is a fascinating, totally different

410
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,920
approach. And I think it also speaks to sort of the usefulness of tools like OS tree and where

411
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,040
those technologies are going. But we wanted, you know, we wanted more details. And thankfully,

412
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,320
our dear friend of the show, Cassidy James Blady was willing to sit down earlier this week with

413
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,520
Chris. He's now working at Endless, and had a bunch of insights to share with us.

414
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,920
So a big welcome back to the show, Cassidy. It has been too long. I think the last time you

415
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,880
and I chatted might have been in person at system 76 last year. Yeah, yeah, it's been a minute.

416
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,040
A lot has changed for you since then. So I know you're now over at Endless,

417
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,040
I think probably last time you're on the show, you're still at elementary. Yeah. So tell us

418
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,160
what you do at Endless and what your title is over there and all that jazz.

419
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,760
At Endless, I'm the partner success engineer. And basically my job, it's funny because it's kind of

420
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,040
this almost, what's the word, amorphous job description. But it's basically like,

421
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:52,160
make sure that our partners are successful and whatever is needed there. And practically,

422
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,800
what that means is I'm a bridge between the engineering team and partner organizations.

423
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:02,400
So there's like other nonprofits, non-governmental organizations, sometimes governments that are

424
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,880
deploying Endless OS in various places around the world. And I help make that happen.

425
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,040
Interesting. Those sound like some pretty heavy hitter clients. It's interesting too,

426
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,560
because knowing what I know about you and your style and your tastes, I think it seems like

427
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,080
Endless is a really good fit because Endless OS itself is one of the most polished Linux

428
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,680
distributions that I've ever used. And there's a lot that goes into making a distribution this

429
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,520
nice, this well put together and this accessible to end users. But yet, I wonder if you agree,

430
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,120
because I know you've been around for a minute in the Linux community. It really doesn't feel like

431
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,160
many people are talking about Endless. Why do you suppose it doesn't quite get the attention,

432
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,240
maybe say a Mint or another distribution that's really desktop focused out there?

433
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:55,600
Yeah. Well, it's funny. It definitely is kind of a sleeper OS in a way, as far as within

434
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:01,520
the Linux community. And I think a big part of that is because the Linux community,

435
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,960
shocker, is not really the target audience of Endless OS. And that's fine. And that's

436
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:13,120
actually pretty cool. The target for Endless OS is these partner organizations and people around

437
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:19,440
the world who need a simple computer. And a lot of times there's a heavy education focus. We work

438
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:25,840
with educational institutions like schools or school districts, and they'll deploy this in a

439
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:31,920
school for kids who have only ever used a smartphone as their computer. And so this is

440
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,760
their first computer, their first real computer. That's a very different audience from what I think

441
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:46,640
most people using Linux Mint or Fedora or whatever are going to be. And that speaks to the diversity

442
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,600
of open source and why I think it's cool. You get a lot of flack sometimes. People say,

443
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,840
oh, why don't all the distros come together and make one super distro? That's recurring,

444
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,520
almost like a meme at this point, right? It's like, why can't we all just make one desktop

445
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,320
environment, one distro, one OS? And while sometimes I do think companies venture out on

446
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,840
their own a little too much and don't kind of work with the rest of the community, I think there's

447
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:17,280
also a place for that. I think there's a place for, we have a target market. We have, I mean,

448
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,040
at Endless, we have a decade of experience working with these organizations and these

449
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,080
deployments around the world. A lot of times it's places with really low power computers

450
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:32,960
with little or no internet or very expensive internet. These are very different users than,

451
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,720
say, a developer running Ubuntu. I think sometimes there's a place for that, for different

452
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,400
solutions for different people. It strikes me, though, that there's a bit of a dichotomy with

453
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,640
this distribution because I think you just really did a really good job defining who the target

454
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,720
user is. But yet, my early investigations into this, it feels like it's built on a lot of advanced

455
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,280
technologies. I feel like I see Flatpaks Incorporated way lower in the system than I've

456
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,800
seen other distributions incorporate Flatpaks. Can you talk about that a little bit?

457
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,160
And I'm actually not super clear on the origin origins of this. Rob McQueen, our CEO, would

458
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,920
actually be the person to dive into the real interesting history here with Collabra and

459
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,720
Lanaro. There was some, the origins of Endless OS comes out of that somehow somewhere. Basically,

460
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,360
it was the first or one of the first image-based Linux operating systems. So we use OS Tree for

461
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:35,360
the operating system at a low level. The whole OS is an OS Tree image and updates come through as

462
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,240
like a diff commits almost like Git. If you're familiar with OS Tree, it's like Git for operating

463
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,960
systems. It's actually the same technology that Flatpak uses under the hood. So the whole operating

464
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:52,400
system's an image and you get updates to it. And then the natural solution for apps on top of that

465
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,360
is Flatpak. Again, similar technology or same technologies under the hood. The biggest thing for

466
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:06,720
us is it has to be bulletproof. It has to just work really well and updates over extremely slow,

467
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,920
extremely expensive data connections. Updates have to come down and they have to be diffs

468
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,280
of the OS. You can't download an entire 100 gigabyte or more image with all the educational

469
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,560
content especially. And you can't download it halfway and then have it fail and download it

470
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,720
again because you're paying per bit. So it has to be bulletproof. On the other side of the keyboard,

471
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,800
on the user side of the keyboard, you have somebody who can't debug it, whether it's a kid

472
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:41,680
at a school or maybe an administrator, a teacher or an administrator at a school who is not an IT

473
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,440
person. The school may not even have an IT department. It's like, it just has to work. It

474
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,080
has to work really well. And so that's really the reasons we use OS3 image-based and Flatpak is. We

475
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,600
can't have package conflicts. We can't have any of that legacy issues that you might have had in

476
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,160
the past on Linux. You know, we've been spending the summer looking at immutable Linux distributions

477
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,480
and Endless feels like the absolute peak implementation where maybe even at first

478
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,720
pass, if you downloaded this and just use it, you wouldn't realize that it's an image-based OS

479
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,240
at all. That's fascinating. And I imagine to pull that off, to integrate Flatpaks like they have,

480
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,560
all of this, there must be a lot of upstream collaboration with the GNOME project and GTK.

481
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,480
And I think this is an area where Endless is probably heavily involved and again,

482
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,720
doesn't get very much attention. Yeah. I love this. Like what I talked to friends about,

483
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,240
they're like, Oh, Endless, I've kind of heard you guys, like heard about you guys. Like,

484
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,000
what do you do? I'm like, well, do you use GNOME software? Do you use Flatpak? Have you ever used

485
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,360
Flathub? Have you ever used the Power Profiles work? Have you ever done anything with Metered

486
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,840
Data? Have you ever, like, if you've done any of that stuff, you've used our software and because

487
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:59,600
we've written it upstream. Even if you've like gone super wild experimental developer, like if

488
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:05,280
you're testing GNOME OS, which is like the open secret GNOME operating system, that's, you know,

489
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,880
just for CI or just, just for testing in CI, not on real hardware, that uses the Endless installer

490
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,520
as its installer. Like we contributed that upstream to GNOME. Much of the work going into

491
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,480
GNOME these days, I don't want to take credit for everything. Like obviously there's so many people

492
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,200
and there's such a diversity of people involved in GNOME, but like much of the work that you don't

493
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:29,440
realize in the GNOME community and the Flatpak community is done by Endless people. I find that

494
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,600
absolutely fascinating. And of course, users get the benefit on all of the distributions, but

495
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,080
it creates this interesting situation where, yeah, Endless isn't necessarily shipping the latest

496
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,440
GNOME base. It's like what, 3.38 or something like that base still, you know, and of course,

497
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,520
GNOME 42 is out and they're working on 43, but yet a lot of the features I'm now enjoying in

498
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,320
current versions of GNOME are actually here in Endless already. Yeah, yeah. The Metered Data is

499
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:03,760
a big example of that. And it was years ago, I went to a hack fest in, I think it was in London

500
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,480
at Red Hat office with a bunch of GNOME people. And I was there, like I was half representing

501
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,080
elementary and half representing System76. Like this is the beauty of open source and all the

502
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:17,360
companies and organizations involved in open source is like, I'm still involved with the exact

503
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,000
same people as when I was working at System76, doing elementary in my free time, and now I'm

504
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,400
working at Endless. But yeah, the focus of that hack fest was Metered Data and Parental Controls.

505
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,240
And those were two features that didn't exist in GNOME and weren't standardized in any way.

506
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,440
They existed in Endless OS downstream and we, Endless sent people to like,

507
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,080
hey, how do we design it in a way that not just works for us and our use cases, we know

508
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:51,200
we have weird use cases for our weird users, you know, compared to the broader Linux community,

509
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,960
but how do we actually do it the right way upstream? And so now that's why Parental

510
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:01,440
Controls is built in. There's a, what's it called? Malkontent, which is a great name for a library.

511
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,960
It's a library for implementing like parental controls and content aware. And it piggybacks

512
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:14,560
on the Flatpak and AppStream data. So like you can restrict your apps that are open based on like

513
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,960
what kind of contents they have. Like there's all these efforts that like we've been kind of had our

514
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,600
fingers in that really make for a really good experience for any general purpose operating

515
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,880
system as well. Yeah. And it makes it safe as a family machine, desktop OS. And that's nice.

516
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,360
And not one you have to tinker with. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. We hear a lot of people who are like,

517
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,560
Hey, I heard this Endless OS thing. Like I'm a developer. It doesn't really make sense for me,

518
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:41,120
which first of all, that's side note. Like I do a lot of development and I use Endless OS,

519
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,480
but I get it. Like maybe, maybe an Ubuntu or Fedora install or something is better for you.

520
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,520
And that's fine. But like, we'll hear from these people. But I bought a laptop for my kid and I

521
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,440
threw Endless OS on it and I just don't have to worry. And it's like, yes, exactly. You don't have

522
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,640
to be an IT person to run it. You don't have to like worry about the content because it has parental

523
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,480
controls built in and it's proven by tens of thousands of active users out there around the

524
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,000
world of like different cultures and different deployments in different countries. So it's a

525
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,760
pretty safe bet. It's maybe one of the lesser known out there, but it should probably get more

526
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,240
attention. I hear from listeners all the time who say, well, I ended up getting a Mac or I switched

527
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,080
to Windows for a bit. I just got too frustrated. And my thought was, is always like, well, you

528
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:29,600
should try something like Endless because you still get to use Linux, you get that environment,

529
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:35,120
but you've got that bulletproof image base, flat packs for the applications. As we kind of

530
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,760
wrap up this little summer journey into immutable Linux, I wonder if you agree that it's going to

531
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:48,720
take a long time, but I could see in five to 10 years, your average users that are getting Linux

532
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,800
systems, maybe they're shipped from a manufacturer for office work and enterprise work and school

533
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,440
work. Doesn't it seem like just the trend is going to be all of those are inevitably going to be

534
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:04,000
immutable based systems, image based systems in some way just because of the problems that solves

535
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,360
for everyday users? It seems inevitable to me. What about to you? Yeah, absolutely. I'm actually

536
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:15,520
more surprised that it's not already happening sooner, if that makes sense. I've been using

537
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:23,120
Silverblue off and on. For a while, it was my way to see what Gnome was up to before I was as deeply

538
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:27,360
involved in the Gnome community, because I just knew I don't really want to fiddle with, honestly,

539
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,120
it was like for me, I wasn't used to Fedora package management. And so I was like, if I just

540
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,080
I can't do Fedora package management with Silverblue, I knew there's RPM, OS3 and stuff.

541
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:43,280
So that was the reason I started on Silverblue and I think it was on Fedora 34. And then that

542
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:49,840
install, I upgraded to 35 and 36. I upgraded to the alpha of 36 and rolled back to 35. And that

543
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:58,080
was flawless. That's what sold me and what blew my mind was like, oh, this is just the way it should

544
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:03,200
be. This is just the right way to do it. And I think all the right people, all the important

545
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:10,080
people working on things know that. I think the hurdles we have to get over is like developer

546
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:15,680
tooling, which I'll say with like with Toolbox and Flatpak Builder and stuff, the developer

547
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,600
experience is actually really good, too. I'm still kind of getting used to doing everything

548
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:25,920
in a toolbox, but it's really nice to have that separation between your host OS and your

549
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,760
development environment. It's a sound concept. Maybe here's my hot take. I would be shocked if

550
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,280
Fedora doesn't switch to Silverblue as the default within the next three years, maybe.

551
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,360
I was going to say five, but I was like, let's be aggressive.

552
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:46,240
Yeah, five was my bet. So three is a little aggressive, but it's wild and I feel like I've

553
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:52,720
had a blind spot on all of this really until about April and then June of this year when I really

554
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,400
started paying attention at the beginning of summer. It's just funny because you look at it

555
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,920
and after you've used it for a bit, you're like, oh, well, clearly this is the way it's going.

556
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:08,320
So it solves so many problems. I was talking with the GNOME design team last week and they're

557
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,200
working on some new features in GNOME software, some new designs, and it's like, you know,

558
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,040
this would just be so much easier if we didn't have to worry about devs and RPMs

559
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,320
and if it was just images for the OS and Flatpaks for the apps. And honestly, that's how I have

560
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,560
Silverblue. That's how Endless OS is set up. It really is nice once you kind of just accept

561
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,840
that's how it works. It's real nice. Yeah, you get that workflow and it functions really good.

562
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:39,680
It's really solid. You have modern applications. You're not stuck to just what's in the repo

563
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,800
and you have that bulletproof reliability. It's such a win. Well, Cassie, it's been really fun

564
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,520
to dig into this. Endless looks like just a beautiful OS. It's just a really great piece

565
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,240
of work and stay in touch. Thanks for coming on and chatting with me and keep up the great work.

566
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:02,640
Sounds good. Thank you. Bitwarden.com slash Linux. Get started with a free trial for yourself

567
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,720
or a team or an enterprise at Bitwarden.com slash Linux. I started as an individual user and now I

568
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,600
use it for my business and Bitwarden makes it really simple all along the way to just have

569
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,400
really great password and security hygiene and store your secrets in a safe place. I imported

570
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,280
from my old password manager years ago and then it was also very simple for others on our team

571
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,520
to import from their password managers and now we can all work collaboratively. And as a team,

572
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,880
we use that daily. But as a business owner, I take some security in knowing that Bitwarden

573
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,600
is open source and it's trusted by millions of individuals in their community. Wes and I use it

574
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,920
every single day personally and for our work stuff. And Bitwarden has been adding features

575
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,600
at an incredible clip. New stuff all the time, like cross domain identity management, of course,

576
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:53,360
username generator, which I think is just brilliant. And they've worked with email relay

577
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:58,960
services. So you could actually even give a unique email, a unique username and a unique password

578
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,320
for every site or service you use. And Bitwarden is the only way I think it's reasonable to stay

579
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,800
secure across mobile and desktop devices. And of course, they have a flat pack app. So it's one of

580
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,720
the very first things I install so I can start authenticating everything because like everything

581
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,960
needs a log in these days. And then, of course, I also have to log in on my mobile device.

582
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,760
And like, am I going to have like this crazy three or four sentence long password that I type in

583
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,480
manually every single time? Of course not. Of course not. And Bitwarden is the best way to

584
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,400
manage that. And it's all your secrets. And you can also put your two factor tokens in there,

585
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,960
which is really convenient. And they make it really simple to manage your personal stuff

586
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,800
and your business stuff. I can attest to that. You can keep them separated, but easily switch

587
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,760
between them. On top of all of that, you can get ease of mind with their vault health reports.

588
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,200
It's so great bringing it all together. And then when you add the new features,

589
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:53,120
just the really smart stuff that they've been like laser accurately adding to Bitwarden.

590
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,520
Oh, it's such a great time to become a Bitwarden user. If maybe you've already done it. You know,

591
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,040
I'd be surprised if you haven't because it is really self-evident. So if you have,

592
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,640
maybe you could suggest this to someone else. It's a great way to support the show as well.

593
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:09,520
Maybe your workplace could use this. We all have a friend or a family member that could probably

594
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,800
do passwords better, better than the sticky under their keyboard. I won't name names,

595
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,480
but I have more than one family member that used to do it that way. I gave the gift of Bitwarden.

596
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,360
You can too. Bitwarden.com slash Linux. One more time to go get it for yourself

597
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:27,920
or for a team. Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

598
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,720
As always, we got some great feedback this week. If you want to send us some,

599
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:41,200
you can go to Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact. Former Gentour sent two ideas I think

600
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:47,440
were worthy of discussion. The first is just a little feedback on Tailscale. They say,

601
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,040
Hey, wonderful team. I've been listening to y'all for a year now, and I'm eternally grateful for

602
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:57,840
Tailscale, which I learned about from you and which I've been using to roll out my own VPN

603
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:02,960
for the family. We're spread out through three continents. I take a good look at every single

604
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,160
one of your software recommendations. Thank you. Isn't that nice? That is nice. That is nice.

605
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,600
We can take full credit for Tailscale. You know, I think the team over there did some of the work

606
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,160
too. We just are standing on the shoulders of giants with Tailscale. We have the easy job of

607
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,760
just being fans. I do like it a lot. It's it's to me, it's the same type of game changer that

608
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:27,360
file sync was and SSH was like it's a it's a whole step change in functionality. And I guess always

609
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:33,360
some some shout outs to old Jason Doenfeld for WarGuard in the fricking first place. Also, another

610
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:38,320
favorite tool of the show is Nebula. It's another really great one that you can completely host

611
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,960
yourself. You need to set it up a little bit more versus Tailscale. It's like, you know, especially

612
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,560
for some of your you know, if you have like staticky backend infrastructure that you have

613
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:51,760
deployed, like Nebula is great and super minimal and fast and clean. If you've got you know, like

614
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,440
a great example would be just a couple of systems or VPS is spread out across a couple of providers

615
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,160
and maybe like the local box and the you're planning to keep them forever. You don't really

616
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:06,080
need mobile a mobile device in there. I think Nebula would work really well for that.

617
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,200
Former Gentooer continued. I haven't heard you mentioned Keybase at all. The client is open

618
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:17,840
source. The server is not ish. It uses GNU PG to implement and an encryption for several sorts of

619
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:23,520
things. Full featured chat, group chat, file sharing, git repos even, and general encryption

620
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:29,360
slash decryption of files. It can even act as a sort of social network where you follow people

621
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:34,720
and can view their public file folders as well as privately chat with them. Works right on Linux,

622
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,160
Mac, Windows, Android, iPhones, and of course it has a pretty capable command line interface as

623
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:46,000
well. The former startup was acquired by Zoom in 2020 after those first security shenanigans,

624
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,320
but everything on the client side still remains open source. Chris, I think you've used Keybase

625
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,480
in the past. Have you not? Or you've explored it? I remember that. Yeah, I guess I still technically

626
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,240
have an active Keybase account. I'm kind of sad Keybase never really took off more. It felt like

627
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,640
it was out of all of like the sort of social things. I think it was a little early. It was

628
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:11,440
a little complicated, but what it really gave you is a way to verify who you are, you know,

629
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,360
because if you go look at like a Keybase profile, you can find mine, keybase.io slash Chris LAS,

630
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,760
I think. And if you go there, you'll see sort of like these ways I've verified this is actually

631
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:29,600
my identity. And that's pretty useful in, you know, the current world that we live in. And so

632
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:35,680
I do that via some, you know, GPG keys. You can do that via Bitcoin addresses. You can do that via

633
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:42,640
by proving a tweet, a GitHub entry, your Reddit account. I also put a file at JupiterBroadcasting.com

634
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,520
that verifies that, you know, just to show that it's me. And I think that's a great concept. And

635
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:52,400
then now they have a Slack-like chat interface. It works on Linux. Yeah, they have built a lot of

636
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,200
kind of cool tools around Keybase. And it does seem like if you've taken the time to kind of set

637
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,400
up your Keybase infrastructure and, you know, verify all these things and connect all your

638
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:05,360
keys and identities, it can be well worth it because it kind of integrates all very nicely

639
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:09,520
in a way that feels a little disparate and thrown out all over the place sometimes with our other

640
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,240
solutions. I think the really the truth is, though, and you just can't overlook it, you can't just

641
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,960
shrug it off, is that Zoom bought them. And I think that just leaves everybody with a little

642
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,560
bit of a bad taste in their mouth. Especially considering the folks who were probably some

643
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,560
of the primary consumers of Keybase, right? Like it was never probably going to be a giant

644
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:30,880
mainstream thing. It was going to be for like privacy folks and tech nerds and all of whom

645
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,760
are a little sketched out by Zoom maybe. I think that's part of it, right? And it's not like they've

646
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,160
messed it up. They've pretty much just left it alone. It really doesn't seem like they've

647
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,680
screwed up the product, but I guess that could change at any point. And I think it's just a

648
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,680
non-starter issue for some people. Like, honestly, if I tried to get you on at Brent and I told you

649
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,280
all about Keybase and then I told you it's owned by Zoom, wouldn't that give you pause? There's a

650
00:56:51,280 --> 00:57:12,400
hesitation for sure. Yeah, I would say so. I've been listening to you for about a year now and

651
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:19,120
a question just crossed my mind. Well, hey, hey, welcome to the show. We're glad to have you.

652
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:25,680
Their question, though. How do you guys all know each other or how did you all meet? That feels

653
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,480
like a big question. I'm kind of glad this came up because it's all starting to fade for me. So

654
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,360
I mean, I remember we tell me always known each other and we've always been doing this show.

655
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:41,680
I don't really remember it before. Right. This is just a side realized last week,

656
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,960
several weeks late, that Linux Unplugged has been running longer than Linux Action Show.

657
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:54,320
Whoa, that is cool. Isn't that mind blowing? I believe Coda Radio has been too. Perhaps not

658
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:59,760
in total years because we took some time off and we did a computer action show. We fooled around

659
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:06,160
for a little bit, tried twice a month for a bit, but yeah, definitely in episode numbers and maybe

660
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:13,040
an actual runtime. So I remember that for episode 100 of the Unplugged program, we did a barbecue

661
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:21,760
meet up. And Wes came with food and commentary, and then I think it's just been every week since

662
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:27,120
then. It's pretty much pretty much we got some like Mexican food and like talked about show

663
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:31,200
stuff at one point, I seem to recall. Oh, OK. And he invited me back like a couple of times,

664
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:35,120
like, hey, you want to come on again? And then at some point I just stopped leaving

665
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,880
where I started. I just started showing up, I guess. I don't know if I was invited or not.

666
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,440
I do like to warm people up with a little El Precios. That's one of my maneuvers.

667
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:50,320
Now that you're talking about it, I sort of recall us revisiting. It might have been for episode 400

668
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,320
that you did a revisit and you had a clip from the barbecue and Wes's first like on the air

669
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:00,400
clip. And I think that was pretty great. And I remember playing it back and it was like,

670
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,680
you'd think Wes had been doing it for 100 episodes. Like he just hit the ground running.

671
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,440
So I was like, well, this guy's got to get on the show. Brent, remind me, how did we meet?

672
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,760
I must have been through the shows Linux Fest. OK. Yeah. What else do you remember?

673
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,680
It's like I say, it's all fate. That's why we got it. It's good. We do this.

674
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:23,920
Yeah, it is. I think Linux Fest is probably a well, both a great place to meet people and

675
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,400
also a place where those memories just get sort of squashed and there's so much happening. And

676
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,240
yeah, this was Linux Northwest. So I think it was must have been.

677
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:38,960
Maybe 2017 would be my best guess. Wow, really? Yeah. And I had planned I was living in Northern

678
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:45,760
Ontario at the time and I had planned to see my brother who was out here in B.C. and also do a

679
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:51,040
little road trip to go to my very first Linux Fest. And that happened to be Linux Fest Northwest.

680
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:59,120
And of course, as a JB fan boy at the time, I wanted to meet all the folks and I ended up

681
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:05,360
driving from B.C. I think. Oh, yeah. Oh, that was what a crazy time. Anyways, I rented a car

682
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:12,880
and drove from B.C. across the border into the US and made my way to the Linux Fest Northwest

683
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,840
parking lot the night before the event started. And it was so late and I didn't have a hotel.

684
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:21,360
I had a tent, but there was nowhere to pitch it. And I was like, OK, I guess I'm going to sleep

685
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:25,440
in the back of this car that I've rented, which is not the first time I've done this.

686
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,080
And you're in a pinch, you know, you're very resourceful. Right. I did bring water and I ended

687
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:35,440
up sort of on campus where they hold Linux Fest Northwest. And I just so happened to find JOOPS.

688
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,880
And I was like, well, I think I'm in the right place. I don't know exactly where to go when the

689
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,000
event starts, but I know at least I'm in the right vicinity. Yeah, we were there overnight

690
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,440
camping as well. So we were there the night before. That's true. We're kind of hard to miss.

691
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,720
Right. And I and then as I was parking, I was like, well, I don't want to park too close to be

692
01:00:52,720 --> 01:01:00,160
like that creep. That's, you know, just within the bounds of the creepy creepiness, but not so far

693
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:05,200
that I don't like. I don't know. So I picked a spot camp there. I think it was like two or three

694
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,400
nights in that car. It's crazy. So I met you at the booth the very first time. You probably met

695
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,960
100 people at that booth. So I don't think you remember. No. Is that true? I thought we met in

696
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,800
the I thought we met in the parking lot in the morning when we let Levi out to go to the bathroom

697
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:23,760
and you were out kind of like waking up and stretching. Oh, yeah. Oh, you're right. I mean,

698
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,560
I'm not a morning person. So you're right. I was like, I don't know, brushing my teeth or something

699
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:34,560
out of a out of a bottle or something. My first thought was, did this guy did he time it so that

700
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,320
way we'd be he'd be out there when we came out? Like, I was wondering, was he waiting for us?

701
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,320
Like, I do remember that night. It rained like crazy, too. And I had my windows open and that

702
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:47,840
caused some issues. Oh, man. Oh, yeah. Good memory. I was like, I don't know. I don't know.

703
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:54,160
Yeah, I was aware that I didn't want to, like, jump you guys at that point and be one of those

704
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:59,760
one of those people. So I was hopefully I left enough space. But, you know, Levi is a

705
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:06,080
conversation starter, and I'm pretty sure we got to talk and and, you know. Yeah. And so thankfully,

706
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:11,920
I that meant, well, you guys were great. You as as all the fans who've met, you know that

707
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:18,480
you just invited me in and gave me a tour of lady jupes. And Levi and I became friends

708
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:27,120
immediately. And I think that just started sort of friendship. And then a few days later, you

709
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:32,720
invited us, of course, to a barbecue at the studio. And I think I never left. I remember

710
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:40,080
sleeping on the floor of the studio one night. And, and I just had a great time post post Linux

711
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:45,600
fest parties at the studio. They got they got out of hand. Yeah. Yeah. Wonderfully so. And

712
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,760
Alan was there and a whole bunch of people. It was a great time. Right. We probably had

713
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:56,320
several projects going on. I'm sure you just got, you know, you know. Yeah. It's funny how those

714
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:01,600
those Linux fest can be life changing. That's exactly what it was. It was like me going to live

715
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:07,840
out a small dream that I had for a few years. And it was even better than I would have expected. And

716
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,640
I remember taking a bunch of photos and being able to share those, which was fun. And that

717
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:19,840
friendship just grew from there. And I was able to actually the way I started with Linux unplugged

718
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:25,200
just by chance was that at that time, I said to you, Hey, if I can help in any way that let me

719
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,840
know. You said, Okay, well, hit me up in like two weeks, because it's kind of insane right now. And

720
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:34,640
so I did. And you were like, Oh, well, actually, Wes is like going to Bali or something. And I

721
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:39,760
need a co host for Linux unplugged for a short time. You want to join me? I was like, sure.

722
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:45,360
Let's see how this goes. I've had that. Yeah, right. That was I was super nervous back then.

723
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:50,160
But you were you were kind enough to give me a try. And then I never left. I bet we talked about

724
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:54,400
digital photography. That was I was fascinated. You know, probably professional photographer

725
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,840
using Linux. It was, you know, I don't see those every day. Bronzewing, thank you for the boost.

726
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:04,880
That was a fun conversation and good refresher. Get all that recalled before we forget it.

727
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:11,760
But the boosts they must go on. Our next one is from solely 86 with 5000 cents.

728
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:18,800
A longtime listener in Australia here. I'm using fountain thanks to JB. So I'm boosting back the

729
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:24,080
free sets I received from them. Well, thank you, silly. Wow, that's a decent return there on the

730
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:29,200
stream of sats 5000 for listening to podcasts. That's a feature in fountain FM is they kind of

731
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:33,680
have like this incentive system. And so we've been getting more boosts from new from new timers who

732
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,200
are just listening to the shows, collecting the sats and then sending them back through boosts.

733
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,640
And I've been doing the same thing. It's been fun. Slowly goes on. I work in it. And of course,

734
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:48,560
we're all Microsoft. I have managed to have most of my workflow in Linux. However, the most

735
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:56,640
important thing is outlook and dot msg files. I like using outlook on the web. However, the business

736
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:03,600
workflow and ticketing system relies on those msg files. Got any ideas on how I can open msg files

737
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:10,720
in Linux without needing to convert the files? Thanks for the great content. The the not needing

738
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:17,920
to convert is tricky. I would say it's worth seeing what evolution can do. I think you'd be really

739
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:22,960
surprised at how easily evolution integrates in with an outlook ecosystem. But it's a lot to

740
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:28,640
install. Personally, I would just make a copy of stuff and I would convert it. I don't know about

741
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,800
us, but that's what my approach would be. Yeah, probably. It sounds like maybe there's some ways

742
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,800
to get Thunderbird to play decently there, too, although I have not tried that. And then as a

743
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:40,960
last resort, we'll have a link to msg convert, which if you have to go to a conversion based

744
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:45,520
workflows, it looks like I think it might even be derived from Thunderbird. And it's a little

745
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:53,040
pearl script to handle msg conversions. I think of it as backup, right? Don't think of it as

746
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:58,080
conversion and duplication. Think of it as backup. Wolfman wrote in with 500 sets,

747
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:04,160
just completed my resume, getting my amateur radio license, and then it occurred to me,

748
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:09,200
does anyone else at JB have their ham license? I've never heard the topic come up on air before

749
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:14,320
something like a DMR repeater or hosting a community DMR server sounds like something

750
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:21,440
the community may get interested in. I kind of agree. We don't talk about ham much. I don't

751
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,320
know much about it, but I think it's super cool. And every time Noah is around, I try to get him

752
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:32,800
to talk about it so I can learn some language. Noah's even left a few devices here, so we

753
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:38,880
technically have devices. I don't know if I'm allowed to use them. I think Cheese was interested

754
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,880
in that stuff too. I remember him doing some like emergency preparedness stuff in his area during,

755
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,800
you know, remember when they got flooded and stuff like that down in Texas. So I think he's got some

756
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,800
experience if I remember. Definitely seems like there's a lot of sort of kindred spirits there,

757
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:57,120
right? Like this sort of self hosting it yourself, learning how this technology works,

758
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:01,360
understanding the physics and computers all involved. Like, yeah, that's some excellent

759
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:09,440
geekery right there. It's the original decentralized. We got a boost 2222 sats row of ducks

760
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,400
from someone named Nix Dash Bitcoin is amazing. I love that. Welcome back. Nix Dash Bitcoin. It's

761
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:21,120
been a bit since we've heard from you. This is what got me into Nix. So nice. I obviously agree.

762
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,920
They're right. Have you considered an AC enclosure in your garage for the server?

763
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:31,120
The enclosure keeps the machines cool and clean. However, if the AC stops running for any reason,

764
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:38,000
then the enclosure will actually turn into a furnace. Chris, I feel like you and I talked

765
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,080
quite a bit about this, I think almost exactly a year ago when we built Oh, no, in January,

766
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:49,040
we built the server rack. And we had many conversations about this. And those were some

767
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:54,720
of the hesitations was like, Okay, well, if we put in some infrastructure, someone has to maintain

768
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:59,520
that infrastructure as well. So how can we do it? I had some ideas about doing it passively. But I

769
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,080
wonder what your thoughts are now that you've been living with the heat again. Of course,

770
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:09,440
I've been all over the spectrum on this. I am beginning to discount colo. We got we got more

771
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,880
boosts that came in just like I want I want a second that the colo stuff. Cool. Cool your role

772
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:19,840
on that. We got some people that that had that opinion. And, you know, we've talked about maybe

773
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:25,200
building a box in the garage. But Jeff and I were talking before the show started. You know, Jeff's

774
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:30,080
been out here he's seen the studio. You think maybe we could do it with some insulation and

775
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:35,360
decent cooling? Or at least we have a shot. Yeah, I think if we insulate the garage attic,

776
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:40,320
because those are typically not insulated at all, maybe double insulate, you know, where it usually

777
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:45,840
is at the barrier of the roof and then up top with the rafters and then definitely insulate the

778
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:51,680
garage door itself. That might be enough with a little you know, a fan a little bit of airflow

779
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,680
doesn't get too hot up there. Yeah. And if it you know, if we kept it somewhere in the 80 degree

780
01:08:55,680 --> 01:09:00,080
range, you know, maybe even a little higher, I'd be fine with that. The servers have survived that,

781
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,880
you know, it's all used gear. Well, I mean, we don't need it to be necessarily perfect uptime,

782
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,320
you know, like if there was okay, there's two heat, we heat waves a year and we shut it down

783
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:12,160
for those. That's at least a lot better than where we're at now. I foresee me being in the

784
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:18,400
attic here in a week or two. I could see that coming. I'll bring a suit. You know, we'll bring

785
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:22,560
Jeff up with us after the road trip, right? And all of us will come up and we'll insulate the

786
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,600
garage. Let's make a plan and I'll take the time off. Let's go. All right. Well, that way,

787
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:34,640
Brent can record up there. Yeah. All right. You're right. That'll be soundproof. Very good.

788
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,040
I think it could work, guys. I think it could work. All right. Then I just have a couple of

789
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:46,160
shout outs. A 50 sats from a VIP torso listening from Finland for over a year,

790
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:51,760
sent in 50 sats. That's like a penny, but it's just amazing that you can do it, right? Like,

791
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:56,400
that's what I think people have to appreciate about Lightning. We got a row of ducks from Mr.

792
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:01,760
Quackers who said he's thinking about changing his name. Whoa. Yeah, he's thinking about changing

793
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:07,840
his name. I would be sad. I like Mr. Quackers. I think we have a really great sound bite that

794
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:13,360
goes with it. Quacka Wacka, it's a treasure. Pick your new name based on sound bite ability.

795
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:22,960
That's all we have. We got 2,000 sats from Trevdev who I said loves GUICs. Geeks. I call it GUICs,

796
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,840
but it's Geeks. I know we're drawing the summer of immutability to a close, but maybe I need to

797
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:34,800
sneak Geeks in there. Good. Now use this scheme. Yeah. There's only so many days in the summer,

798
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:41,600
though. We also got 2,323 sats from Logic. He boosted when we were live, and we were having

799
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,080
some trouble last week, and he was helping troubleshoot, so I'm going to be leaving

800
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,560
Helipad up during live shows. We don't actually have the live tag yet, but some people are still

801
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:52,080
boosting it during the show, so I don't want to miss those. If you'd like to send us a boost,

802
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:58,320
go grab a new podcast app, newpodcastapps.com. Podverse is totally free. It's in F-Droid. It's

803
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:04,080
on iOS. It's in Android, and it's going to be all over our new website. Then you really get the

804
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:10,800
trifecta because the web, the mobile apps, GPL, it's gorgeous. You heard us talk about Fountain.

805
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:16,960
That's one that lets you actually earn sats for listening to podcasts, and Cast-O-Matic is great

806
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,920
on iOS as well. There's a whole bunch over at newpodcastapps.com, including Breeze. You don't

807
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:28,800
have to change your podcast app and boost CLI if you really want to be a Geek. We got a bag of

808
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,360
picks here, and what do you say, Wes? Should we give just a mention to Visi Data? That was one of

809
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:39,680
the many tools that you used to go sort the hat to get our JPL names. Yeah, we definitely should,

810
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:45,360
just because you know how we love dirty command line picks, and this is one that multiple audience

811
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:49,120
members, you know, anytime we talked about fun little command line tools or especially like

812
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:55,680
command line spreadsheets or like data manipulation or charts, Visi Data came up, and I hadn't had a

813
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:59,680
chance to actually play with it until I was kind of going through these CSVs that we got out of

814
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:03,840
our next cloud and thinking, you know, there's got to be a better way. I don't really want to

815
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,800
do this in a browser. I definitely don't need LibreOffice installed on this machine. I have a

816
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,600
terminal. Visi Data was perfect. You can do operations on multiple rows, multiple columns.

817
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,240
You can do pivot tables. You can do charts, and because it's all like powered with Python,

818
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:23,840
you can just run your own Python scripts on the data powered by Visi Data. It's pretty rad.

819
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,240
It was very handy. I think this is probably a tool we'll be going to for these types of things

820
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:35,200
in the future, and I love that it has pivot tables. MiniMech sent in a Google Teller pick.

821
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:39,680
This one's kind of creepy, isn't it, MiniMech? Yeah, that's a really cool one. We will love

822
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:45,200
that one. So, I was reading my favorite news site, which is Der Standard Arteis, an Austrian

823
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:50,160
news site. Give it a try if you're familiar with the German language. So, they wrote an article

824
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:56,000
about that tool, Google Teller, and that is a tool that gives you some feedback from your internal

825
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,200
computer speaker whenever there is some data exchange between your browser and one of the

826
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:07,120
Google servers and services, like Google Search, Google Ads, Google Fonts, YouTube, whatever.

827
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:12,240
So, imagine the situation you have Google Chrome or Chromium open, and you type something in the

828
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:18,160
address bar. In these two browsers, you have the active word prediction active. So, whenever you

829
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:23,200
type a letter in there, your computer starts beeping, and that, in the end effect, means

830
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:28,160
every single address you type in in Google Chrome and Chromium in the address bar gets sent to

831
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:33,680
Google. Everything, everything. Other example, you have an ad blocker. You don't have an ad blocker,

832
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:39,200
and you start loading your favorite news site. Your computer is screaming because of all the

833
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:45,600
Google ads, for example. Interesting fact, you have the whole site loaded, and you start scrolling

834
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:50,800
around, and all of a sudden, you have these beeps again because, I don't know, some cookie sends the

835
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:56,800
exact position you are on that site or some other info to Google. It is really a weird, interesting

836
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:02,240
experience. So, that tool is really worth playing. You will find the code on GitHub. You have to

837
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:07,360
compile it, and it's only working in Linux for now because it works in combination with other

838
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:12,400
IP tables. But, in fact, the installation instructions and usage are well described,

839
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,480
and I guess you will do a link in the show notes. You got it. We will have a link in the show notes.

840
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:22,000
If you want a little audible indication that motivates you to get rid of Google as fast as

841
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:28,640
possible, that's the way to do it. Imagine combining that with a game plan to migrate

842
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:33,280
off Google in one week to just really get you across the finish line. You should treat it maybe

843
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,960
like a radar detection tool, you know, where you hear those little beeps and you worry about your

844
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:43,120
safety. And then, Brett, we have a feedback item that came in. It's a feedback pick. We do. Josh

845
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:48,480
wrote in and suggested Espanso. I think it's probably the best way to say that. It's an

846
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:53,920
open source text expander that has builds for Windows, Linux, and Mac with Wayland and M1

847
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,640
beta support as well. Get out of here. Whoa. Yeah, I know. As you might have expected,

848
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:04,240
it's also written in Rust. Are you serious? That's great.

849
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:12,160
So this is really handy because text expander is one of these independent tools on the Mac. I

850
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:19,280
think it's, I don't know. But you type a sequence of characters, you know, like some sort of short

851
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:23,920
code that you've created, and then it will expand that to a whole set of predefined text that

852
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:30,000
supports variables and whatnot. Super common for just doing rapid replies to emails or some sort

853
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,840
of repetitive thing that you have to type a lot. You add a short code for it, and then it expands

854
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:38,160
it out into a fuller sentence or whatever it might be. Maybe you want to insert your address

855
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:41,760
or your email address and you don't want to type it out every single time or a web address or

856
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:46,320
maybe it's a block of code. And it's a really handy tool. I've tried it. I find it to be really

857
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:50,960
heavy on the Mac and expensive, so I've never really tried it for a prolonged period of time.

858
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:56,800
But the idea that you can get this working on Wayland is huge because I kind of had given up

859
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,160
on this concept. I thought this was going to be something I could only do on X11. So this is a

860
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:06,560
fantastic find. Plus, it looks like it's GPL3. I mean, that's kind of rad and Rust and quick and

861
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:12,320
a really slick little website and a nice little repo and seemingly some good docs. What a find.

862
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:16,560
This is a treat. Like pretty often we've heard of the apps that get sent in, but

863
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:22,160
oh my gosh. And it has packages. Of course, all these things have packages so you can extend it,

864
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:28,240
add more stuff, shell script support, form support. Oh, that's nice. So you can add,

865
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:32,320
you can replace some of the variables. Oh, this is getting installed after the show,

866
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,800
gentlemen. That's what I say. They've got a tab. There's an app image here. Hey, yo. Hey,

867
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:44,000
Wes, see if it's in the next package. Not this problem again. I'm sure it's in there. You are,

868
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,040
dang it. Well, that was great. If you want to send us in something, either a boost or a regular old

869
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:54,240
email, that's just great. You can head over to linuxunplug.com slash contact. I'm curious to

870
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:58,880
know out there if anybody out there has endless OS in production or maybe you've deployed it for

871
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:04,640
somebody. If that's you, send us a boost or send us an email and let us know how you're using it.

872
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:09,440
I'm trying to get a sense of how well it's known in our audience. I guess on that same token,

873
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,280
I would like to know if you'd never heard about it. Let us know that too. I'd like some,

874
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:18,400
just some kind of data points around endless OS and how it's perceived out there or how it's

875
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:23,760
getting used. And if you want to join us live on a Sunday, we do this show over at jupyter.tube

876
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:29,280
at noon Pacific, 3pm Eastern. And something that we do for our members at unpluggedcore.com

877
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:37,200
is we record this live stream, which is huge. It's like two hours and 20 minutes ish. It's

878
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:41,840
getting close to that right now as we go. It's just a lot more show. We have some stuff we're

879
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,320
doing. We got business we're attending to and you get to listen in on all that. See how the podcast

880
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,560
sausage is made. And we also make an ad-free version available as well, if you just prefer

881
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,040
something short, concise and fully produced by our editor, Drew. That's unpluggedcore.com if you'd

882
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:59,120
like to support the show and keep us independent. That's like the turkey bacon to the sausage of

883
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:03,760
the full show. Yeah. And you can get the full, like what would it be when you do the Jupiter

884
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:08,080
party? Would that be like the meat pack or what is that? Like it's a veggie burger stack? Like

885
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:14,160
full English breakfast. Yeah. I get the full English breakfast over at jupyter.party. Support

886
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:18,160
all the shows, get all the features. You pick which shows the blood sausage though.

887
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:26,800
That's right. You had to go there, Wes. No, Wes. No. I'm going to get that visual out of my head.

888
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:31,360
I think I like mashed potatoes. Maybe one of them is mashed potatoes. Maybe one of them is catfish.

889
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:36,960
I don't know. You let me know. I don't know. Don't miss Linux Action News. That's all I know.

890
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:41,280
That's all I know. Linuxactionnews.com. We're covering the stuff that really matters in the

891
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:46,800
world of Linux and open source every single week. We'd love you to catch it. So go grab that. And

892
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:53,280
links to everything we talked about today over at linuxunplug.com 473. You get our mumble info,

893
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:58,240
our matrix info, the contact form, all of it over there. And go check out the new site,

894
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:02,240
new.jupyterbroadcasting.com. Let us know what you think. Thanks for joining us.

895
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:17,520
See you right back here next Sunday.

896
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:43,120
So let's talk about that new website. We're down to the final hours.

897
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,560
Is it hours? I thought we had days.

898
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,600
I think you could measure it in actual hours.

899
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,000
That's right.

900
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,720
It's true. We need a countdown. We need a countdown.

901
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,880
Some say it is the final countdown.

902
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,120
Final countdown.

903
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,000
Yeah, I see it.

904
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
We don't have a license for that. Dang it.

905
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,200
Well, I could just sing it. That's fine. It's definitely the last kind of week for what we

906
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:13,920
have. I had it, so I had to use it.

907
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,480
Well, if you got it, use it if you got it.

908
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:22,640
Yeah, I feel like it's definitely we can say it's the last week for our what we're calling

909
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:28,560
the 1.0 milestone of the website. I think maybe the three of us should have some discussions on

910
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:34,000
whether or not the current website does everything we need on the as far as the back end goes.

911
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:39,200
But as far as front end, I feel like the new website has gotten really far. Chris,

912
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:43,840
I know there's a bunch of like features that have been implemented in the last what week or

913
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:50,480
week and a half that have been helping you quite a bit, like the PeerTube embed and stuff like that.

914
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:55,280
That's my favorite one. Let's be honest. There's so much good work going in. So I don't want to

915
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:01,440
play favorites. I love all my children. But how awesome is this? So I may have mentioned this

916
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:08,560
already, but now when you go to the new new dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com site and you click

917
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:16,080
live, that site will auto embed the current live stream from PeerTube just automatically gives you

918
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:19,120
the current live stream. We don't have to do anything. We don't have to put embed code in

919
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:24,400
there. It just drops it right in there. No updates, no manual stuff. It's awesome.

920
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:28,080
And it's great because it's a static website, too. So the way you really have to do that is you'd

921
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:32,240
have to go edit the site, rebuild the site, redeploy the site. Right. So it's so nice that

922
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:38,320
it just automatically embeds and updates. It's coming along. I think it's getting really close

923
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:42,000
to a one point. I think there's a little few you know, there's a few things like down here we can

924
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,240
still clean up the bottom and stuff like that. But yeah, there's a bit of bit of stuff to do.

925
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:51,760
But I feel like the essentials important part is like all the you know, all the bones, right? All

926
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,080
the pieces that like are hard to figure out or can it work that way? It seems like that is all

927
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:01,760
resolved. And now it's kind of just the polishing layers. And I want to say a huge kudos to everyone

928
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:07,440
who's been helping on this project. I've been super impressed with how many people have been

929
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:13,840
involved in the matrix room, but also the number of people who've been committing ideas and changes

930
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:21,200
and opinions and all of that to the project. So thank you to everyone. And I think it's important

931
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:28,960
to say that Kyle Potts put in quite an amazing PR last week, and it just got merged,

932
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:39,600
I think a day or two ago. They wrote some intent testing via playwright for the site. And I am

933
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:45,760
still on the very edge of beginning to understand what that means. But I think it is it helps us

934
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:51,840
test the the commits that are coming in in a way that emulates browsers, that's going to be super

935
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:56,240
helpful for us not breaking the site in production, which we've done a few times in the last few

936
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:00,560
weeks. So that sounds like an amazing tool. I'm looking forward to learning it. I don't know if

937
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:05,200
either of you played with that, Wes, maybe you have, but we're certainly going to talk more

938
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:10,480
about it in office hours this coming Tuesday. Great office hours dot hair.
