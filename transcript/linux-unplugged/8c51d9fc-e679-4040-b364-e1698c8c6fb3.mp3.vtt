WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
I know you were looking into how to migrate off

00:01.920 --> 00:04.740
of Silverlight, Wes, and I've got great news for you

00:04.740 --> 00:06.760
because a team of experts came together

00:06.760 --> 00:09.000
and created OpenSilver.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.700
Finally, a modern, plugin-free, open-source

00:11.700 --> 00:15.180
re-implementation of Silverlight just in time.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.020
That's great.

00:16.020 --> 00:17.040
I finally don't have to move on

00:17.040 --> 00:20.760
and learn any sort of new HTML5-based technology.

00:20.760 --> 00:32.600
Hello friends, welcome in to Linux Unplugged episode 344.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.440
My name is Chris.

00:33.440 --> 00:34.400
My name is Wes.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.560
Wes, this week, your weekly Linux talk show

00:36.560 --> 00:38.720
ended up running Windows 10.

00:38.720 --> 00:39.720
What?

00:39.720 --> 00:41.000
It's been quite the week.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.400
We figured to round out last week's episode,

00:43.400 --> 00:46.080
it'll only be fair to take a look at Windows 10

00:46.080 --> 00:47.820
and load it up with the latest and greatest

00:47.820 --> 00:49.480
that Microsoft has to offer

00:49.480 --> 00:51.960
and how perfect it happened to coincide

00:51.960 --> 00:56.620
with us both attending the very first WSLConf,

00:56.620 --> 00:58.980
the Windows Subsystem for Linux conference.

00:58.980 --> 01:02.180
It's really showcasing how people can get work done

01:02.180 --> 01:04.500
on Windows in Linux,

01:04.500 --> 01:06.480
or another way to put that is showcasing

01:06.480 --> 01:08.380
some of the work they'll be able to do soon.

01:08.380 --> 01:10.000
We'll tell you a little bit about that

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
and what our experience has been like

01:12.000 --> 01:14.360
at a Linux event that has put together

01:14.360 --> 01:16.960
like a canonical Microsoft joint effort.

01:16.960 --> 01:17.780
It's been something.

01:17.780 --> 01:18.620
Oh yeah.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.460
We've been attending this morning

01:19.460 --> 01:20.720
and we'll tell you all about that.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.240
Of course, we've got community news and some app pics,

01:24.240 --> 01:27.480
but first I've got to say a hearty afternoon to Mr. Bacon.

01:27.480 --> 01:28.320
Hello Cheesy.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.360
Hello there.

01:29.360 --> 01:30.320
How are you?

01:30.320 --> 01:31.280
Oh, you know, pretty good.

01:31.280 --> 01:32.100
Been up early.

01:32.100 --> 01:35.480
We got in at 6 a.m. to do the WSLConf

01:35.480 --> 01:38.520
because even though it was a Pacific Coast event

01:38.520 --> 01:40.560
at Microsoft, once it went virtual,

01:40.560 --> 01:41.520
they opened it up to the world

01:41.520 --> 01:43.160
and so they made it East Coast time.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.900
And so it started really early for us.

01:44.900 --> 01:47.080
At 6 a.m. this morning?

01:47.080 --> 01:49.520
Yeah, your boys have been podcasting since 6 a.m.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.840
Is it still going on?

01:50.840 --> 01:52.040
Yeah, it's still going on right now,

01:52.040 --> 01:55.040
but we hit the old pause button to do this

01:55.040 --> 01:56.440
and then it continues tomorrow

01:56.440 --> 01:57.280
and we'll be attending again.

01:57.280 --> 01:58.680
So definitely still time to catch it,

01:58.680 --> 02:00.560
sign up, go check it out live if you want.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.400
Yeah.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.520
And also a huge time appropriate greetings

02:03.520 --> 02:04.460
to our virtual lug.

02:04.460 --> 02:05.300
Hello Mumble Room.

02:05.300 --> 02:06.140
Hello.

02:06.140 --> 02:06.960
Hey.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.800
Hey.

02:07.800 --> 02:08.640
Hello.

02:08.640 --> 02:09.460
Hello.

02:09.460 --> 02:10.300
Howdy.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.560
Well, howdy to Ace Nomad, Brent, Bight, Carl,

02:12.560 --> 02:16.120
Computer Kid, Frank, Colonel, Neon Popey,

02:16.120 --> 02:21.120
Stefan, Stewin, Tech Mav, Tyler, and Mr. Wimpy.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.160
Hello you all.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.000
It's so good to see you.

02:23.000 --> 02:23.820
Wow, what a crowd.

02:23.820 --> 02:26.340
We've been, have you been WSLing Popey or Wimpy?

02:26.340 --> 02:27.380
I've had it on in the background

02:27.380 --> 02:29.120
while I've been doing my other work, yes.

02:29.120 --> 02:30.200
Yes, yes.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.320
I've actually been sitting here

02:31.320 --> 02:32.980
and paying quite a bit of attention to it

02:32.980 --> 02:34.920
and cutting some clips and whatnot,

02:34.920 --> 02:36.600
which is one of the nice things of it being virtual

02:36.600 --> 02:39.760
is it's actually pretty easy for us to get audio.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.600
A lot less work.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.960
Yeah, probably the easiest conference I have ever attended.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.280
Yeah, but we'll get to that in a moment.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.840
First, I wanna cover something that Jim Salter posted about

02:49.840 --> 02:51.040
over at Ars Technica,

02:51.040 --> 02:53.940
and that is the ZFS Snapshot support

02:53.940 --> 02:57.060
that is landing in Ubuntu 2004.

02:57.060 --> 02:59.160
This is something you and I have been speculating a lot

02:59.160 --> 03:00.520
about where is this gonna go?

03:00.520 --> 03:03.600
And we've gotten some indications over the last few months

03:03.600 --> 03:06.160
about Snapshots getting built

03:06.160 --> 03:09.160
into the package management system of Ubuntu,

03:09.160 --> 03:10.780
so that way when you install a package,

03:10.780 --> 03:12.480
before that package is actually installed

03:12.480 --> 03:14.640
or the change is executed, a Snapshot is taken.

03:14.640 --> 03:15.720
Right, I mean, this is functionality

03:15.720 --> 03:17.000
we've been experimenting with,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.040
totally different world over with ButterFS and Snapper.

03:20.040 --> 03:22.020
It'd be nice to have it just built right in though.

03:22.020 --> 03:23.560
And the user doesn't have to worry about it.

03:23.560 --> 03:24.880
It's invoked by the package manager.

03:24.880 --> 03:25.800
Exactly.

03:25.800 --> 03:29.080
So Jim dug into how this works exactly.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.480
He says when you first get Ubuntu installed,

03:30.480 --> 03:33.300
there aren't any fresh Snapshots on the system yet,

03:33.300 --> 03:37.060
but if you do say apt-get install gimp,

03:37.060 --> 03:39.640
you'll see that ZSys has taken a Snapshot

03:39.640 --> 03:41.960
of every data set present in the R pool,

03:41.960 --> 03:43.120
and there's a lot of data sets.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.280
Oh, yeah.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.920
Thankfully though, having a Snapshot taken

03:45.920 --> 03:48.000
prior to installing any new packages

03:48.000 --> 03:49.760
means that something should go haywire,

03:49.760 --> 03:51.760
which I mean, it doesn't happen that often

03:51.760 --> 03:53.880
on Ubuntu these days, but it certainly can.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.880
You can easily revert the system back to its prior state

03:56.880 --> 03:58.520
before you had that package installed.

03:58.520 --> 03:59.800
Yeah, that's nice.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.840
Carving up the system into so many different data sets

04:01.840 --> 04:04.080
means in turn that we can roll back

04:04.080 --> 04:05.420
only those parts of the system

04:05.420 --> 04:07.120
affected by the package manager.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.520
You don't have to Snapshot your entire root partition

04:09.520 --> 04:11.340
because you've got these data sets parceled out,

04:11.340 --> 04:13.480
and that means you've got a lot more granularity and control.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.960
So it's a little more complicated

04:14.960 --> 04:16.720
by having more data sets,

04:16.720 --> 04:19.800
but it's less complicated from a restoration standpoint.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.460
And the idea in theory is that ZSys

04:22.460 --> 04:23.920
is going to be managing that for you,

04:23.920 --> 04:26.400
so unless something goes really wrong,

04:26.400 --> 04:27.520
you don't have to worry yourself

04:27.520 --> 04:28.880
about how many data sets there are.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.280
Yeah, that's kind of the whole thing that's nice about it

04:31.280 --> 04:34.800
is it's essentially transparent to the user

04:34.800 --> 04:36.480
until they need it,

04:36.480 --> 04:39.340
and Dydrox tweeted back to Jim and said,

04:39.340 --> 04:42.000
by the way, you can actually revert the system state

04:42.000 --> 04:45.400
from grub, too, which is a way for a user

04:45.400 --> 04:47.600
to actually just from a GUI revert back.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.680
Jim had some questions around,

04:48.680 --> 04:50.240
okay, I can see how you can take a Snapshot

04:50.240 --> 04:51.160
and trigger that all to happen,

04:51.160 --> 04:53.660
but how do I actually go back and restore that state

04:53.660 --> 04:55.000
without having to go to the low level

04:55.000 --> 04:57.400
and roll back each data set individually?

04:57.400 --> 04:58.840
Dydrox is sort of explaining,

04:58.840 --> 05:01.420
actually, we're planning to use grub for that.

05:01.420 --> 05:03.120
Pobay, I know you've been playing around with 2004.

05:03.120 --> 05:04.440
Have you played around with any of this stuff?

05:04.440 --> 05:06.860
Did you do the experimental ZFS support,

05:06.860 --> 05:08.580
or did you go extended four?

05:08.580 --> 05:12.920
So I did go ZFS on my main ThinkPad,

05:12.920 --> 05:14.200
so the machine I'm on right now,

05:14.200 --> 05:16.920
and every so often, I apt install something.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.880
Because it's clean, I've got to go through

05:18.880 --> 05:20.880
and install a few things,

05:20.880 --> 05:22.360
and I do that on demand as I need them.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.880
Every time I do that,

05:23.880 --> 05:26.320
I see the little line that says saved system state,

05:26.320 --> 05:28.480
and I'm thinking, ooh, that's nice.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.480
I haven't actually had to revert anything yet,

05:30.480 --> 05:34.360
and I think Dydrox is right to point that out.

05:34.360 --> 05:38.320
The whole grub thing is supposed to be the user-facing part

05:38.320 --> 05:42.000
so that that whole, oh, my system is broken.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.320
What on earth do I do?

05:43.320 --> 05:46.160
Well, you just reboot and choose a different snapshot,

05:46.160 --> 05:47.380
and then you're back in the game.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.220
It's brilliant.

05:48.220 --> 05:49.060
I love it.

05:49.060 --> 05:49.880
Kind of makes sense,

05:49.880 --> 05:50.720
instead of having to troubleshoot

05:50.720 --> 05:51.560
from a possibly broken system.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.280
Yeah, I think Jim's coming across it,

05:54.280 --> 05:58.320
coming to it as someone who is deeply technical

05:58.320 --> 06:00.840
and very much a ZFS expert,

06:00.840 --> 06:02.680
whereas we're trying to pitch it towards people

06:02.680 --> 06:04.840
who don't care about what technology is under the covers.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.120
They just know that if they need to go back in time,

06:07.120 --> 06:07.960
they can do.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.440
Right, they might not even know it's,

06:09.440 --> 06:11.280
or likely don't even know it's ZFS.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.120
Right.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.160
It's just happening.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.960
That's fascinating and totally makes sense

06:14.960 --> 06:16.400
for a broader audience.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.040
Wimpy, I'm kind of curious if you have thoughts

06:18.040 --> 06:20.200
on where the future of this stuff could go?

06:20.200 --> 06:25.200
Well, for 2010, it's going to be all about encrypted ZFS.

06:27.120 --> 06:27.960
Ooh.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.120
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.480
That's great, and of course it would make sense

06:31.480 --> 06:32.960
to do that in the 10 release.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.120
Yeah, that's awesome.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.700
Hmm, I think I'm gonna do it.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.880
So we put Windows 10, I was actually,

06:39.880 --> 06:41.600
so I was gonna go to 2004.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.320
I had already even made the USB drive for you.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.520
Yeah, yeah, like I was gonna do it after the show,

06:45.520 --> 06:47.760
but then we were like, we should really round out

06:47.760 --> 06:49.960
our experiences learned from Mac OS

06:49.960 --> 06:52.240
with our experiences learned from Windows

06:52.240 --> 06:53.580
and give it a real fair shake.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.880
Try to remove as much bias as possible,

06:55.880 --> 06:57.920
try to take our time setting it up right,

06:57.920 --> 06:59.600
use the new Windows subsystem.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.160
Actually try to get work done with it.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.420
Try the new terminal, all that stuff.

07:03.420 --> 07:05.960
And I didn't end up on Ubuntu as a result of that,

07:05.960 --> 07:08.920
but once I take Windows off, and hint, yes,

07:08.920 --> 07:10.400
I will be taking Windows off,

07:11.300 --> 07:13.280
I'm gonna go with 2004, and I think I'm gonna do it.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.400
I'm gonna do the ZFS.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.960
It's neat to see some of this happening too.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.300
I think we all speculated, all right,

07:18.300 --> 07:21.180
is this gonna be an area that Ubuntu explores down the road

07:21.180 --> 07:23.280
when ZFS wasn't announced,

07:23.280 --> 07:25.760
as built right in way back when?

07:25.760 --> 07:28.680
It's finally here, I mean, it's nice to see.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.740
I agree, I agree, and gonna be fun to play around with.

07:31.740 --> 07:33.040
Something to look forward to.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.320
I'm trying to think of ways in which I can break my system

07:35.320 --> 07:36.280
so that I can test this,

07:36.280 --> 07:37.880
because it's pretty boring at the moment.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.800
Nothing's broken, so it's a bit of a challenge

07:40.800 --> 07:42.760
to see if I can exercise this thing.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.000
You just need to write a quick script

07:44.000 --> 07:45.160
that deletes random files,

07:45.160 --> 07:46.740
and you know, share that with everyone.

07:46.740 --> 07:47.580
Yeah, there you go.

07:47.580 --> 07:50.480
I think it's a pretty great idea for a workstation.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.680
I mean, obviously it's good for,

07:51.680 --> 07:52.820
I mean, I think when we talk about this,

07:52.820 --> 07:54.040
we're often talking about servers,

07:54.040 --> 07:55.100
and updates, and stuff like that,

07:55.100 --> 07:57.000
but I think it's really nice

07:57.000 --> 07:58.860
for a peace of mind from a workstation.

07:58.860 --> 08:00.660
Just to be able to roll back, and know like,

08:00.660 --> 08:03.160
okay, maybe I'll go deal with why that upgrade failed later.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.200
Right now I have work to get done.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.280
Yes.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.420
Oh, yeah, you know, like last night.

08:10.760 --> 08:11.920
I should never do this.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.520
Don't do like Chris does.

08:13.520 --> 08:14.360
Oh boy.

08:14.360 --> 08:18.080
But I'm having a problem with my Home Assistant app

08:18.080 --> 08:20.440
on my phone, can't connect to my Home Assistant server.

08:20.440 --> 08:21.800
The webpage works fine,

08:21.800 --> 08:24.640
and the system has needed rebooted recently

08:24.640 --> 08:25.720
a couple of times, so I thought, you know,

08:25.720 --> 08:26.960
I'm just gonna do a full update.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.840
It's been a little while since I've updated

08:28.840 --> 08:31.000
the Raspbian install on this box,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.920
and I'll get the latest Docker image,

08:34.920 --> 08:37.600
and reboot, and see if everything just works.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.300
Maybe I don't need to try much further than that.

08:39.300 --> 08:40.720
You know, just basic troubleshooting stuff.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.880
Right, update and see if it fix it.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.580
Until it's like bedtime, and I'm getting up super early

08:45.580 --> 08:46.940
to get in here to do WSL Conf,

08:46.940 --> 08:48.160
so I'm trying to go to bed early,

08:48.160 --> 08:51.520
and it's still taking forever to write the packages

08:51.520 --> 08:52.840
because of the slow SD card,

08:52.840 --> 08:55.800
and I think to myself, if this breaks,

08:55.800 --> 08:57.280
I'm gonna be up all night fixing this.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.680
Like, it's a very important system.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.160
It's those things where like, I know I shouldn't do it,

09:00.160 --> 09:02.120
but normally it works, so I'm just gonna take the risk

09:02.120 --> 09:03.840
and do it, and then it...

09:03.840 --> 09:04.920
It did work, it did work.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.040
No, everything was fine.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.300
It rebooted, everything was fine,

09:07.300 --> 09:08.740
but the thought I had was,

09:08.740 --> 09:11.040
oh man, I wish I had a snapshot right now.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.660
I wish I would've done, because like last week,

09:12.660 --> 09:13.640
I was talking, or the week before,

09:13.640 --> 09:15.240
I was talking about making an image backup of it,

09:15.240 --> 09:16.600
which I still haven't done.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.360
And I was really regretting it, but everything went fine.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.400
But those snapshots will just give me

09:23.400 --> 09:24.680
a little bit more peace of mind.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.960
All right, you're not allowed to watch anything new on Plex

09:26.960 --> 09:29.040
until you've got those backups.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.040
What about existing shows?

09:30.040 --> 09:32.160
Picard's on, Picard's on.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.640
I gotta watch Picard.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.920
I know, it's ridiculous.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.460
And to make matters worse, I'm heading off to go to Denver,

09:37.460 --> 09:39.640
so it's not like I'm gonna have time to do it anytime soon.

09:39.640 --> 09:40.840
Wait, you're going to Denver?

09:40.840 --> 09:42.660
I'm going to Denver, Wes.

09:42.660 --> 09:46.760
So it's been kind of like one of those,

09:46.760 --> 09:48.280
should I go, should I not go?

09:48.280 --> 09:50.360
But when I saw how successful

09:50.360 --> 09:52.080
the App Center for Everyone campaign was

09:52.080 --> 09:54.920
for the elementary OS guys, 190% funded.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.000
They raised $19,000. Wow.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.120
They're going for 10,000.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.360
And I started thinking about what it is here

10:02.360 --> 10:03.200
that's so appealing.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.000
And I mean, there's the factor of, you know,

10:05.000 --> 10:07.560
elementary OS is a proven project

10:07.560 --> 10:10.400
that has delivered results for years

10:10.400 --> 10:12.920
with a steady progression in improvements,

10:12.920 --> 10:15.560
but they've also delivered on these sprints in the past.

10:15.560 --> 10:16.780
So there's that aspect of it

10:16.780 --> 10:19.120
that makes it pretty much a sure bet.

10:19.120 --> 10:22.680
But my time on the Mac that just wrapped up

10:22.680 --> 10:24.960
was so freaking like perfect

10:24.960 --> 10:28.280
because it showed me how necessary

10:28.280 --> 10:31.680
a healthy third-party app ecosystem really is

10:31.680 --> 10:34.480
and how important developers actually paying to eat

10:34.480 --> 10:37.080
and feed their families actually plays a role

10:37.080 --> 10:40.120
in them staying committed and creating great software.

10:40.120 --> 10:42.060
And I think I was starting to buy into,

10:42.060 --> 10:44.760
well, we can have just everything that's a free ecosystem.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.600
It's a utopia and it's going to be fine.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.200
It'll just take a while.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.840
And then, and then I tried a few apps

10:50.840 --> 10:52.920
that are so far and above better

10:52.920 --> 10:56.160
than anything that I have used in years.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.480
I really had to have a think about it.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.280
And then this thing lands

10:59.280 --> 11:01.560
and it's so outrageously well-funded.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.720
I realized this could be the spark

11:04.720 --> 11:07.160
that sets off a very important fire

11:07.160 --> 11:11.180
because this is a cross distribution payment backend system

11:11.180 --> 11:12.820
done by a proven project.

11:12.820 --> 11:13.960
And if they're successful,

11:13.960 --> 11:16.680
they'll likely be others that crop up to compete with it.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.080
And we'll have multiples in the market,

11:19.080 --> 11:21.120
but somebody has to prove it out that it's worth it.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.680
And somebody has to make something

11:22.680 --> 11:24.840
that is easy for developers to digest.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.240
And these guys also have a track record of doing that.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.640
And I think I want to be there for whatever happens.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.240
If it's a huge success

11:33.240 --> 11:36.420
and it kicks off a new revolution of desktop Linux software,

11:36.420 --> 11:38.160
I want to be there for that moment.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.780
If it's nothing more than just watching

11:39.780 --> 11:41.720
a well-organized project execute

11:41.720 --> 11:44.520
on something that their community finds important,

11:44.520 --> 11:46.480
I want to document that.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.080
And if it's an utter failure,

11:48.080 --> 11:50.280
I'd like to have insights as to why.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.360
So I am packing up lady jupes.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.640
I'm getting out of the COVID-19 hot zone

11:54.640 --> 11:57.360
and I'm heading to Denver to document this thing.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.160
I'm doing it on my own dime.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.800
And I go into the rationale and all of that

12:00.800 --> 12:04.560
in the Chris Last cast, chrislast.com slash nine.

12:04.560 --> 12:05.720
I'm going to go there, I'm going to document it,

12:05.720 --> 12:07.040
I'm going to talk to the guys.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.760
I'm going to wrap my head around what they're doing

12:08.760 --> 12:11.080
because I think, especially after my recent time

12:11.080 --> 12:13.200
visiting the Mac, this is so important.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.680
And this is the first step.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.620
If they're successful, others will follow.

12:16.620 --> 12:20.640
And then we will have ourselves a real functioning system

12:20.640 --> 12:23.520
that it gives developers a path to monetization

12:23.520 --> 12:25.440
to create high quality software

12:25.440 --> 12:28.280
that can run on top of our free operating system.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.480
And I think there's something amazing about that,

12:30.480 --> 12:32.180
that this free operating system

12:32.180 --> 12:34.220
could become a viable economic platform

12:34.220 --> 12:35.720
for people to feed themselves.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.740
I want to see it.

12:37.740 --> 12:39.220
So I'm paying for it myself.

12:39.220 --> 12:40.080
It's not a work function.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.600
It's not really something that I think work

12:41.600 --> 12:42.720
probably is very interested in.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.400
It's not really in the core area of their interest,

12:45.400 --> 12:46.740
but I think it's important.

12:46.740 --> 12:48.920
Hey, I'm glad I'm going to live vicariously through you

12:48.920 --> 12:49.760
because you're right.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.280
I mean, the elementary project and Dan and Cassidy

12:52.280 --> 12:54.400
as developers and creators who, you know,

12:54.400 --> 12:55.840
obviously love the Linux platform

12:55.840 --> 12:57.760
and are trying to build things for it,

12:57.760 --> 13:00.640
they get those problems of, well, how do I get money?

13:00.640 --> 13:02.000
What framework do I target?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.640
How do I even build an app that's going to work

13:03.640 --> 13:05.840
with all the things that I need?

13:05.840 --> 13:07.120
I think they're a great team

13:07.120 --> 13:09.120
to try to take on this challenge.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.680
A hundred percent funded on day four,

13:11.680 --> 13:13.980
619 backers when I checked.

13:14.880 --> 13:15.720
That's pretty big.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.240
And this is the only way we're ever going to beat the Mac.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.520
If you want to be, if you want to become a popular platform

13:20.520 --> 13:23.520
for the average user, you got to get there.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.400
It's, you know, I think it's,

13:25.400 --> 13:28.400
I think it's a cliche to blame marketing.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.400
To say that it's a lack of organized marketing

13:30.400 --> 13:31.440
that has prevented Linux

13:31.440 --> 13:33.320
from getting adopted to the marketplace

13:33.320 --> 13:35.080
is a fundamental misunderstanding

13:35.080 --> 13:37.180
of what makes the market move.

13:37.180 --> 13:40.480
It's wishful thinking that that's all that has to be solved.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.120
The reality is, is this has to be solved first.

13:43.120 --> 13:46.120
Well, and I think that there's a ton of great apps already

13:46.120 --> 13:49.700
available in the App Center that are, in my opinion,

13:49.700 --> 13:51.720
on a different level than a lot of the free apps

13:51.720 --> 13:54.240
that you would get from any other distribution.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.960
Namely like Quilter.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.560
I love, I don't know if you've tried that one or not.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.200
I think the developer is asking like nine bucks for it.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.980
I gave them 10, but it's a Markdown editor.

14:04.980 --> 14:08.280
Super clean, super efficient Markdown editor

14:08.280 --> 14:10.660
with a preview toggle and a Markdown toggle.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.800
I actually picked it up from the JB Telegram.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.560
I was asking for an awesome Markdown editor.

14:17.560 --> 14:22.240
And I think it was Shicken who had suggested it to me.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.360
So I've been using that one.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.960
Cassidy's got some pretty cool apps out there.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.680
Palette is a pretty cool one that he's made.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.400
But there's tons of apps that are already out there

14:31.400 --> 14:32.560
that are excellent.

14:32.560 --> 14:33.400
Really nice.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.520
And I think that going forward,

14:35.520 --> 14:38.960
what they're starting to create is an environment

14:38.960 --> 14:41.080
where I can purchase these apps

14:41.080 --> 14:44.540
and then I can reload my whatever laptop

14:44.540 --> 14:47.440
and download all the apps that I've already purchased.

14:47.440 --> 14:49.920
Previously, I don't mind giving to that developer again,

14:49.920 --> 14:54.380
but if that app ends development,

14:54.380 --> 14:57.300
at least I've already got that purchase locked down.

14:57.300 --> 15:00.520
I try to make some examples of what I think are apps

15:00.520 --> 15:03.840
that just could not be replicated on the Linux side

15:03.840 --> 15:04.880
in that Chris Lastcast.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.200
So if you think I'm wrong,

15:06.200 --> 15:08.980
I first encourage you to check out episode nine,

15:08.980 --> 15:11.040
because I think I make the case of applications

15:11.040 --> 15:14.660
that are the prime example of things that you could only have

15:14.660 --> 15:16.600
if there was a monetization path.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.920
Well, that is the stability too.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.040
It's monetization and knowing that this platform

15:20.040 --> 15:20.880
is going to be around.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.920
I can enter here and I'll get some stuff back.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.520
And it's not all going to change out from under me.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.600
I can build a long-term customer base.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.640
That's really important.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.100
There's a culture shift that has to happen along with that.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.920
And that is that Linux users are willing to pay for software,

15:33.920 --> 15:35.680
but it's a chicken and the egg problem right now.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.600
And the advantage that the elementary OS guys have

15:38.600 --> 15:40.560
that I see over previous projects,

15:40.560 --> 15:42.960
and I'd like to get Popey's take on this here in a second,

15:42.960 --> 15:46.200
is they are well-liked throughout the community.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.920
They have good standing and they're creating something

15:49.920 --> 15:52.000
that is going to be generally available.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.240
It's not just distribution-specific here.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.160
And I think maybe that might be some

15:56.160 --> 15:57.560
of the fundamental difference here.

15:57.560 --> 15:58.760
Popey, what do you think?

15:58.760 --> 16:02.080
Yeah, they also have a solid developer story,

16:02.080 --> 16:06.280
which we've got some experience of making a paid app store

16:06.280 --> 16:08.960
in that we did it back in the 1204 days.

16:08.960 --> 16:12.200
And we didn't have a solid developer story.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.920
It was build a dev of anything and submit it

16:15.920 --> 16:17.320
to the store and we'll review it

16:17.320 --> 16:19.360
and maybe it'll go in, maybe it won't.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.920
And while there were paid apps in there,

16:21.920 --> 16:25.200
it was a mishmash of basically awful applications.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.120
There wasn't anything really compelling.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.520
And I think because the elementary guys

16:29.520 --> 16:33.120
have set their bar quite high for their expectations

16:33.120 --> 16:35.960
and they've set that their documentation is solid

16:35.960 --> 16:38.760
and they've made opinionated choices

16:38.760 --> 16:41.740
about what you need to do in order

16:41.740 --> 16:43.640
to be accepted in the store.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.520
I think they're going to end up with a bunch

16:45.520 --> 16:47.720
of beautiful functional applications

16:47.720 --> 16:49.560
that developers will get paid for.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.160
Whether they get paid enough

16:51.160 --> 16:52.440
and whether they get enough apps

16:52.440 --> 16:55.600
is the thing we can only tell by doing this for years

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
and looking back on it.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.440
I agree.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.840
I think that's the yet to be seen.

16:59.840 --> 17:03.480
And if it will be enough to stop the natural momentum

17:03.480 --> 17:05.480
towards just publishing things

17:05.480 --> 17:07.840
as an electron application,

17:07.840 --> 17:09.800
which seems to be where we're building momentum to

17:09.800 --> 17:12.720
and is functional and will be generally accepted

17:12.720 --> 17:14.240
by those that just need to get work done,

17:14.240 --> 17:16.520
especially those in an enterprise environment,

17:16.520 --> 17:18.440
but it's not ideal in all cases.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.280
I think it's fine for some applications,

17:20.280 --> 17:22.520
but I don't think it's ideal for all applications.

17:22.520 --> 17:23.920
And that's why I really would like to see

17:23.920 --> 17:25.880
a healthy native application ecosystem.

17:25.880 --> 17:30.340
Even if we could only point to a dozen to 30

17:30.340 --> 17:33.480
semi-healthy applications that have been monetized.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.140
Like right now, when I think about applications

17:36.140 --> 17:37.680
that take direct money

17:37.680 --> 17:40.580
in the traditional sales transactional sense,

17:40.580 --> 17:42.140
I know I'm wrong on this,

17:42.140 --> 17:44.880
but the only commercial application I can think of

17:44.880 --> 17:47.680
off the top of my head is Crossover,

17:47.680 --> 17:48.880
where you download it on Linux,

17:48.880 --> 17:49.800
you get a 30-day trial,

17:49.800 --> 17:52.280
and then you pay your 50 bucks or whatever it is.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.700
Well, there are certainly paid apps

17:54.700 --> 17:56.240
in other Linux app stores.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.560
Sure, sure.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.080
The monetization system is something that already existed

18:01.080 --> 18:03.240
that the software vendor has implemented.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.640
It's not implemented in the store.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.240
So you pay a monthly fee for Spotify,

18:07.240 --> 18:11.200
or you pay a fee for Slack or Skype,

18:11.200 --> 18:13.720
but they all have their own ways

18:13.720 --> 18:15.720
of taking their funds out of you,

18:15.720 --> 18:17.440
which doesn't benefit the distro.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.960
Whereas what elementary are doing

18:19.960 --> 18:23.000
ensures that it's sustaining the distro

18:23.000 --> 18:24.520
as well as the developer.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.560
Great point.

18:25.560 --> 18:28.040
Yeah, services have really kind of brought

18:28.040 --> 18:29.880
a whole new wave of applications to Linux

18:29.880 --> 18:32.120
because when you're monetizing as a service,

18:32.120 --> 18:34.040
you want to bring on as many users as you can.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.480
So that that shift in monetization strategy

18:36.480 --> 18:39.480
has actually benefited Linux users to some degree,

18:39.480 --> 18:40.960
but I'm sick and tired of it.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.480
I'm so sick of subscriptions.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.720
I've been thinking like Hediana,

18:44.720 --> 18:45.660
when we get back from Denver,

18:45.660 --> 18:47.360
we're gonna have a calling where we just sit down

18:47.360 --> 18:48.800
and look at all those subscriptions right now

18:48.800 --> 18:49.640
and cancel stuff.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.460
It's like you need some subscription service

18:51.460 --> 18:52.920
to manage all your subscription services.

18:52.920 --> 18:53.800
There is one.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.240
I saw it advertised on Twitter.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.060
There is one.

18:56.060 --> 18:57.520
We'll give that a try.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.800
Yeah, just needs access to everything real quick

19:00.800 --> 19:01.640
to do that.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.680
So no bigs, right?

19:02.680 --> 19:03.880
No bigs.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.760
Anyways, I'm very excited about it.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.680
One of the things that we haven't really talked about

19:07.680 --> 19:09.440
and it's kind of a concern to me

19:09.440 --> 19:12.920
is how the community itself is gonna react.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.480
Obviously, I hope that this is kind of a change

19:16.480 --> 19:19.280
in which the community doesn't always have to

19:19.280 --> 19:21.280
have something that's free,

19:22.200 --> 19:25.040
that they can actually donate to something,

19:25.040 --> 19:27.880
donate to a project and help push these developers forward

19:27.880 --> 19:31.640
and instead of, I guess, expecting it to always be free.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.840
I think there will be a negative reaction though

19:33.840 --> 19:36.600
from a portion of the community.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.460
And I think that's one of the reasons I want to go.

19:38.460 --> 19:41.600
So that way, when I'm having a conversation about it,

19:41.600 --> 19:44.440
I have that on the ground insight into this.

19:45.280 --> 19:48.600
Plus, I think it's just really good to just reestablish

19:48.600 --> 19:51.560
in-person connections with this team

19:51.560 --> 19:54.000
and with all of the events getting canceled.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.480
There won't be an opportunity likely this year

19:55.480 --> 19:58.080
to actually go see Dan and Cassidy.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.200
Get it while you can.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.380
Are you really just going down there

20:00.380 --> 20:02.000
so that you can get your hoodie early?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.960
Yeah, they better have them.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.120
Swag pickup.

20:05.120 --> 20:05.960
Right.

20:05.960 --> 20:09.720
Yeah, I suppose, full disclaimer, I was a backer,

20:09.720 --> 20:12.040
but I think I said that earlier.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.840
So we'll see where it goes.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.480
I think it's still going to be good for me to do it

20:15.480 --> 20:17.280
and I'll talk about it here on the show

20:17.280 --> 20:18.600
and let you guys know how it went.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.080
I'm excited for them though.

20:20.080 --> 20:23.880
I think it's pretty tremendous that they got $19,000

20:23.880 --> 20:26.600
and it didn't quite make their next stretch goal,

20:26.600 --> 20:28.140
but I think they'll still be able to put that money

20:28.140 --> 20:29.000
to really good use.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.800
And one of the things that I think also was a takeaway.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.000
Oh, I want to mention this too.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.160
I know I'm going on about this,

20:34.160 --> 20:36.600
but I think there's a lot to learn here.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.460
I think there's things for other distributions

20:38.460 --> 20:41.200
to pay attention here that are working for them.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.040
Think about this.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.680
How many distributions do we know

20:43.680 --> 20:46.600
that have a couple of full-time staff

20:46.600 --> 20:49.440
and have these successfully community-funded sprints

20:49.440 --> 20:50.760
where they get together as a team

20:50.760 --> 20:52.400
and then produce something?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.480
That sounds like Ubuntu.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.320
It sounds like it's Ubuntu.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.160
Sure does.

20:56.160 --> 20:57.920
Fedora has Flock and there's some,

20:57.920 --> 21:01.120
but they really have figured out a recipe here

21:01.120 --> 21:03.160
that I think other distributions could look at

21:03.160 --> 21:05.040
as a pathway to success.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.160
And part of it is because of their special sauce,

21:07.160 --> 21:09.040
but I think there's things to learn here.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.240
And that's another reason I want to go

21:10.240 --> 21:11.800
is I think there's things for other distributions

21:11.800 --> 21:12.640
to learn here.

21:12.640 --> 21:13.600
And I want to learn what it is.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.840
And you just like Denver.

21:14.840 --> 21:15.780
That's true.

21:15.780 --> 21:16.620
That's true.

21:16.620 --> 21:18.040
Although when I'm going through Wyoming,

21:18.040 --> 21:20.240
it's supposed to get really cold.

21:20.240 --> 21:21.840
We're going to be up at like 8,000 feet

21:21.840 --> 21:23.460
and it's snowing right now.

21:24.620 --> 21:26.040
So I'm really going to be watching the weather

21:26.040 --> 21:27.880
very closely for that.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.960
It's not a great time of the year.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.240
You wanted an adventure, right?

21:31.240 --> 21:33.240
Yeah.

21:33.240 --> 21:37.640
All right, well let's do a little housekeeping.

21:37.640 --> 21:38.680
You know what I just realized?

21:38.680 --> 21:41.440
This is the best turnout we have ever had

21:41.440 --> 21:42.440
after daylight savings.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.480
Fantastic.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.140
You all did a tremendous job.

21:45.140 --> 21:46.800
Usually there's like four of you in here

21:46.800 --> 21:47.640
after daylight savings.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.000
No one's shown up grumpy and confused late in the show.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.060
Yeah, I was going to make a special reminder

21:52.060 --> 21:55.320
about daylight savings has happened now in the US.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.300
And so it'll take a little while

21:57.300 --> 21:58.520
before it changes everywhere else.

21:58.520 --> 22:02.200
And typically it messes up everybody's live schedule,

22:02.200 --> 22:04.400
but look at this rocking,

22:04.400 --> 22:06.080
like it's such a great showing

22:06.080 --> 22:07.040
that I didn't even cross my mind

22:07.040 --> 22:07.920
until we got to the housekeeping.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.080
So thank you everybody.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.500
We do this Tuesdays, jblive.tv.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.600
If all goes as planned,

22:14.880 --> 22:17.620
I'll be live streaming from Denver next week.

22:17.620 --> 22:20.300
I'll be remote at Denver in Lady Joops.

22:21.240 --> 22:25.980
There is an RV park called the Flying Saucer.

22:25.980 --> 22:26.820
I love it.

22:26.820 --> 22:28.920
It's right by where they're having a sprint.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.960
So just park up right there,

22:30.960 --> 22:33.320
do my shows, get my work done,

22:33.320 --> 22:35.040
head over to their place, do interviews.

22:35.040 --> 22:35.880
It's going to be great.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.260
It's just, so it's jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

22:38.260 --> 22:40.320
If you want to watch that train wreck in real time,

22:40.320 --> 22:41.680
because that one's going to be tricky,

22:41.680 --> 22:42.800
show up next week.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.040
Yeah, definitely a live one.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.320
Yeah, jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar

22:46.320 --> 22:47.600
for your local time zone.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.680
So far, still chugging right along.

22:50.680 --> 22:53.820
FOSTOC live June 20th at the Harrison,

22:53.820 --> 22:56.140
which is near King's Cross in London.

22:56.140 --> 22:58.900
Some of your favorite Linuxy podcasters get together

22:58.900 --> 23:00.960
and have themselves a night.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.020
As far as I know, it's a go.

23:02.020 --> 23:03.720
Popeye and Wimpy, I believe you're going to be there.

23:03.720 --> 23:04.880
I don't know otherwise.

23:04.880 --> 23:05.720
Yeah.

23:05.720 --> 23:06.560
It's going to be there.

23:06.560 --> 23:07.380
Yeah.

23:07.380 --> 23:08.220
It may change.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.060
Who knows?

23:09.060 --> 23:10.760
Just need to figure out what the show is going to be.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.760
Small matter of that, but other than that, yeah.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.140
Pandemic pending.

23:14.140 --> 23:15.720
Pandemic pending.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.640
It should be going June 20th.

23:17.640 --> 23:18.600
Tickets are on sale now.

23:18.600 --> 23:20.440
Pay what you want for that.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.800
And I hear that the Ubuntu podcast

23:23.800 --> 23:25.720
is always one to catch live.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.080
Set expectations there.

23:27.080 --> 23:27.920
Thanks.

23:27.920 --> 23:28.760
Yeah.

23:28.760 --> 23:32.600
We've been bumped up the billing list this year.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.320
I hear, Adam, if you can only catch one show in the year,

23:35.320 --> 23:36.140
that's the show.

23:36.140 --> 23:36.980
This is the one.

23:36.980 --> 23:37.800
Oh, no.

23:37.800 --> 23:38.640
And we need everyone to go.

23:38.640 --> 23:40.180
I mean, we can't make it, unfortunately.

23:40.180 --> 23:41.100
So go in our stead.

23:41.100 --> 23:41.940
Go and tell us.

23:41.940 --> 23:44.100
Come back on the Mumble Room, on the podcast,

23:44.100 --> 23:45.880
and give us your full review.

23:48.120 --> 23:51.360
Also, a plug for Linux Headlines, linuxheadlines.show.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.320
Every single weekday, in three minutes or less,

23:53.320 --> 23:55.120
you get the news, and it's great.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.240
It's a great way to stay up to date.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.460
And then last but not least, join us on our Telegram

23:59.460 --> 24:00.920
at telegram.com slash.

24:00.920 --> 24:01.920
No.

24:01.920 --> 24:02.720
No.

24:02.720 --> 24:03.840
It's probably something like that.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.320
But it's Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

24:05.320 --> 24:05.920
Have you heard of that?

24:05.920 --> 24:06.840
Slash Telegram.

24:06.840 --> 24:07.400
Have you heard of that, Wes?

24:07.400 --> 24:08.040
Oh, yeah.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.640
You're familiar with that?

24:09.640 --> 24:10.140
Yeah.

24:10.140 --> 24:11.640
You know, Headlines is no joke.

24:11.640 --> 24:14.200
I try to stay up on the news, but already twice this week,

24:14.200 --> 24:15.320
I've learned things from Headlines.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.040
I know.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.080
It's quite the system.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.120
Things I needed to know.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.920
All right.

24:20.920 --> 24:24.040
So our ThinkPads have Windows 10 installed on them.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.840
Now, you have a dual boot, right?

24:25.840 --> 24:26.320
Oh, yeah.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.160
Of course I do.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.680
I went all in.

24:28.680 --> 24:29.680
I did it 100%.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.680
And then what I was thinking I might do later

24:31.680 --> 24:35.120
is when I go 2004, just resize the main partition

24:35.120 --> 24:36.120
and maybe keep them on there.

24:36.120 --> 24:36.800
It's a nice way to handle, too.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.920
See how Montu's installer does with that.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.120
Yeah, exactly.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.040
And what do I care?

24:41.040 --> 24:42.400
I mean, it'll handle it great, of course.

24:42.400 --> 24:46.520
Well, and if it doesn't, could not care less.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.920
Hey, I installed that.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.480
So I think we should start with WSLconf,

24:50.480 --> 24:52.920
because that's going on right now as we record.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.600
And then we should loop back and, I think,

24:54.600 --> 24:56.840
talk about our Windows 10 experiences,

24:56.840 --> 24:59.640
because a lot of it's centered around WSL, which is, of course,

24:59.640 --> 25:02.400
as you guys probably know, the Windows subsystem for Linux.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.960
And starting with version 2, which

25:03.960 --> 25:05.880
is rolling out on the Insider builds right now.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.920
So if you want to go get all up to date,

25:07.920 --> 25:10.560
you can grab an Insider ISO that is already

25:10.560 --> 25:12.200
at a build number high enough now

25:12.200 --> 25:14.560
that you can just install WSL2.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.600
The key thing, and there's a lot to it,

25:16.600 --> 25:21.640
but the key thing about WSL2 to take away is it's much faster

25:21.640 --> 25:24.560
and it's a proper tiny Hyper-V VM.

25:24.560 --> 25:28.880
And to that end, the different distributions and projects

25:28.880 --> 25:30.720
that ship on WSL have been working

25:30.720 --> 25:33.060
to take advantage of some of these improvements.

25:33.060 --> 25:35.480
And it's in a really good position right now.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.680
And so Wes and I were extremely curious what

25:38.680 --> 25:43.240
it's like to go attend a Linux event at the Redmond campus.

25:43.240 --> 25:47.480
However, because of the current corona concerns,

25:47.480 --> 25:49.840
it transitioned to a virtual event.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.640
And very quickly, which, I mean, that's

25:51.640 --> 25:53.240
difficult for any conference.

25:53.240 --> 25:56.040
Side note, when all of this is over,

25:56.040 --> 25:58.280
I would love to invite Hayden on the show

25:58.280 --> 26:00.440
and get the scoop from him on how the hell he pulled it off.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.360
Because the amount he must be working

26:02.360 --> 26:04.160
and the whole team behind this event because.

26:04.160 --> 26:07.800
Unbelievable to convert a in-person conference

26:07.800 --> 26:10.960
at the Redmond campus into a virtual event

26:10.960 --> 26:13.280
with presentations and hundreds of attendees.

26:13.280 --> 26:16.320
Way more viewers now.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.800
I got to get the story on that.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.960
But I figured I wasn't even going to ask him right now.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.880
Because he's just trying to get through the event.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.480
It's still going on right now.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.440
And I was very impressed because they pulled it off.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.640
And they ended up using Red Hat's blue jeans for it,

26:29.640 --> 26:31.680
which is the first time I'd ever used blue jeans.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.280
And so I get into the studio this morning.

26:33.280 --> 26:34.000
I bring it up here.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.440
And I started recording some clips.

26:35.440 --> 26:38.000
So that way we could share a bit of it with you.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.240
And we start with an introduction and a bit of history

26:40.240 --> 26:41.640
of the subsystem.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.920
OK, we are live.

26:43.920 --> 26:47.600
Welcome, everyone, to the first WSL Conf, now virtual.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.640
Welcome, attendees.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.480
Welcome, speakers who are joining us.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.280
And welcome, our friends from Microsoft.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.280
Thank you for your participation and your support

26:56.280 --> 26:57.200
for this event.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.320
And of course, this is Hayden Barnes from Canonical.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.560
Thank you, attendees, for coming out.

27:02.560 --> 27:06.760
Some of you from very far-flung time zones, we appreciate it.

27:06.760 --> 27:11.000
Speakers who have been flexible with us at this time,

27:11.000 --> 27:15.160
adjusting from in-person to virtual to shifting time zones,

27:15.160 --> 27:18.200
we know it's been a hassle, and we appreciate

27:18.200 --> 27:21.320
what you've done for us to bring us everything

27:21.320 --> 27:23.120
you're going to show us.

27:23.120 --> 27:26.280
Thank you to Canonical for sponsoring this live stream

27:26.280 --> 27:30.440
and to Microsoft for creating the WSL platform

27:30.440 --> 27:33.440
that we build on.

27:33.440 --> 27:37.600
We have come quite a ways on WSL, Windows Subsystem

27:37.600 --> 27:38.960
for Linux.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.160
Those of you may recall, Microsoft first

27:41.160 --> 27:46.760
announced Bash on Ubuntu on Windows in 2016.

27:46.760 --> 27:51.280
And then in 2017, it became Windows Subsystem for Linux,

27:51.280 --> 27:56.680
WSL as we know it today, with a growing ecosystem of distros

27:56.680 --> 27:58.960
on the Microsoft Store.

27:58.960 --> 28:02.680
Two years later, Microsoft announced WSL 2,

28:02.680 --> 28:08.000
and that was the version of WSL with a live Linux kernel.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.880
And we are looking forward to that shipping

28:10.880 --> 28:13.760
in April of 2020.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.560
Just coming up here soon.

28:15.560 --> 28:20.480
Might coincide if we make it with Ubuntu 2004.

28:20.480 --> 28:24.240
Now, of course, when you go from a physical event

28:24.240 --> 28:26.320
to a virtual event, you are still

28:26.320 --> 28:29.240
subject to the very things that many virtual events are

28:29.240 --> 28:32.320
subject to, like microphone issues.

28:32.320 --> 28:35.280
Craig, we're having issues with your audio, I think.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.160
And like so many presentation applications,

28:38.160 --> 28:40.480
they can be buggy, plugins can crash.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.880
Hello, there we go.

28:41.880 --> 28:42.680
Let's try this again.

28:42.680 --> 28:43.800
There we go.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.680
I had a plugin crash.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.040
OK.

28:48.040 --> 28:51.600
So thank you so much, Hayden.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.520
So one of the things, and then he crashed again.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.400
But one of the things, once Craig got going,

28:55.400 --> 28:57.960
he's a program manager for WSL.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.480
And Wes and I had this conversation

28:59.480 --> 29:03.480
about another program manager who also presented,

29:03.480 --> 29:07.800
these individuals at Microsoft really know these products.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.880
I thought when I heard the term program manager,

29:09.880 --> 29:11.760
I thought, oh, that's a fancy PMO.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.880
They probably don't know all the technical details.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.720
No, these individuals, they know the nitty-gritty details.

29:16.720 --> 29:17.360
That's just it.

29:17.360 --> 29:20.080
You can tell that they've worked on computers for a long time.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.720
They understand what the technology is.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.880
It's not just someone who's part of the business

29:23.880 --> 29:25.160
mechanics behind the scenes.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.120
Yeah, and I'm not just trying to blow smoke here.

29:27.120 --> 29:30.280
I have had this impression when I work with Microsoft

29:30.280 --> 29:33.320
individuals a couple of times that these people,

29:33.320 --> 29:34.940
they know their job in a way that is not

29:34.940 --> 29:39.400
typical in corporate America, if I could make that statement.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.640
So somebody that's maybe not actually hands on the code

29:41.640 --> 29:43.600
generally has a pretty high level

29:43.600 --> 29:45.600
abstracted understanding of the product,

29:45.600 --> 29:48.680
whereas these individuals truly understand the product.

29:48.680 --> 29:53.360
And so Craig begins to explain a bit of what he does in WSL.

29:53.360 --> 29:54.960
My name is Craig Lowen.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.720
I am a program manager here at Microsoft

29:57.720 --> 30:00.760
working on the Windows subsystem for Linux.

30:00.760 --> 30:04.120
And I wanted to say welcome on the behalf of the Linux

30:04.120 --> 30:05.880
community here at Microsoft.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.100
We're going to be here.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.200
Did you catch that part?

30:08.200 --> 30:13.760
He says welcome on behalf of the Linux community at Microsoft.

30:13.760 --> 30:15.520
During this presentation, something else

30:15.520 --> 30:17.840
that struck both of us was that some

30:17.840 --> 30:20.840
of the individuals at Microsoft are of an age

30:20.840 --> 30:23.400
where they maybe have not worked there

30:23.400 --> 30:27.480
before Microsoft was all in on both embracing and, I would

30:27.480 --> 30:29.480
say, monetizing open source.

30:29.480 --> 30:33.300
They've only been there since Microsoft existed in the state.

30:33.300 --> 30:34.960
They were not there in the bad old days.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.960
This is the only Microsoft they know.

30:37.960 --> 30:42.800
And there's something just that really strikes me

30:42.800 --> 30:45.240
about that, because it sort of shows

30:45.240 --> 30:47.680
like a new era of people that have entered the company

30:47.680 --> 30:48.720
in the last five years.

30:48.720 --> 30:50.960
Because this has been a, I don't know if we're almost

30:50.960 --> 30:52.600
into an eight, nine year transition now.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.200
And people that have joined in the last five day years

30:55.200 --> 30:57.800
have existed in this giant organization

30:57.800 --> 30:59.320
in its current state.

30:59.320 --> 31:03.000
And Force, and in the chat, as well as listening to you,

31:03.000 --> 31:06.960
if you have any feedback, we are also at linuxatmicrosoft.com.

31:06.960 --> 31:10.640
So you can send us an email there and talk to us.

31:10.640 --> 31:12.400
And thank you so much for coming out.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.360
We're really excited for this event,

31:14.360 --> 31:19.440
barring the technical instructions that we just had.

31:19.440 --> 31:22.120
And we're here to talk about the Windows subsystem

31:22.120 --> 31:24.000
for Linux, WSL.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.480
This is something that I work on directly.

31:26.480 --> 31:31.000
I hand a lot of the feedback and talk about WSL all the time.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.960
So for me personally, it's awesome to be here

31:33.960 --> 31:37.600
and to hear exactly why you're using WSL 4,

31:37.600 --> 31:40.640
what your feedback is, and how we can improve it.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.480
And we're excited to be talking about all the new stuff

31:43.480 --> 31:48.400
coming out with WSL, with WSL 2 coming out soon,

31:48.400 --> 31:50.440
and all of the details with that,

31:50.440 --> 31:54.000
as well as all the exciting new features coming up with WSL.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.520
In fact, as different contributors added,

31:56.520 --> 31:59.080
what they are changing, like Docker, for example,

31:59.080 --> 32:00.720
maybe some of the most significant changes

32:00.720 --> 32:02.000
are coming to Docker.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.480
Docker on Windows is transitioning to using

32:04.480 --> 32:06.280
the kernel that's built in WSL 2,

32:06.280 --> 32:08.360
instead of shipping their own kernel now.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.480
That's massive.

32:09.480 --> 32:10.320
It's a huge reduction.

32:10.320 --> 32:12.000
It's a big architecture change, yeah.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.520
It's a big reduction in complications,

32:13.520 --> 32:15.120
is what I was going to say, but it's also,

32:15.120 --> 32:16.800
it means Docker is no longer responsible

32:16.800 --> 32:17.640
for shipping their own kernel.

32:17.640 --> 32:19.680
They'll use the built-in subsystem stuff,

32:19.680 --> 32:22.080
which will have obvious performance advantages.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.560
As Craig wraps up, he added.

32:23.560 --> 32:27.440
And I kind of wanted to give a Microsoft showcase

32:27.440 --> 32:31.720
or highlight reel of the Linux activity going along

32:31.720 --> 32:34.720
inside of Microsoft besides just WSL.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.480
And he goes off a litany of projects

32:36.480 --> 32:38.200
that they're working on that are open source

32:38.200 --> 32:41.800
and individuals that are using Linux inside Microsoft.

32:41.800 --> 32:44.840
And then he wraps up with a bit of a shout out

32:44.840 --> 32:46.120
to the Linux community.

32:46.120 --> 32:50.640
So that's kind of the Microsoft core ecosystem

32:50.640 --> 32:52.640
of people that are building directly on WSL.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.200
There's also tons of other stuff going on

32:55.200 --> 32:59.600
with the WSL community, beyond just what's going on here

32:59.600 --> 33:01.280
at Microsoft specifically.

33:01.280 --> 33:04.560
There's all the distros that are running on it.

33:04.560 --> 33:07.360
Thank you to all of our distros, like definitely Canonical

33:07.360 --> 33:10.880
as well as OpenSUSE Alpine, Penguin, Debian, and more

33:10.880 --> 33:15.360
who allow all of your Linux binaries to run

33:15.360 --> 33:18.840
on the WSL platform as well, and Kali for sure,

33:18.840 --> 33:21.880
as well as WSL utilities, Docker desktop,

33:21.880 --> 33:24.200
which is building an experimental engine

33:24.200 --> 33:29.200
that uses WSL2 into their Docker desktop for Windows client.

33:29.200 --> 33:33.680
These are all people who are directly innovating on WSL.

33:33.680 --> 33:38.360
Yeah, a lot of software that makes it so simple

33:38.360 --> 33:40.800
to develop software for Linux that you never,

33:40.800 --> 33:42.600
but you never have to leave the Windows environment.

33:42.600 --> 33:46.080
Yeah, it's a little scary, spooky almost.

33:46.080 --> 33:49.040
I mean, we were watching a presentation about C++

33:49.040 --> 33:50.680
where they've just turned Visual Studio

33:50.680 --> 33:53.800
into an integrated GDB enabled debugger.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.600
And it's like the best visual interface

33:55.600 --> 33:56.600
to GDB you could ever want.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.240
Oh, you want to use GCC and CMake?

33:58.240 --> 33:59.760
That's fine, that's no problem.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.840
You're empowered to target Linux

34:01.840 --> 34:03.680
from these very powerful Windows tools.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.320
And you see some of Microsoft's competencies, I think,

34:06.320 --> 34:08.680
that we on the Linux side have kind of,

34:08.680 --> 34:11.080
maybe not ignored, but didn't interface with directly

34:11.080 --> 34:12.600
because that was for building Windows things

34:12.600 --> 34:13.880
that we weren't interested.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.360
And suddenly those are all just unleashed

34:16.360 --> 34:17.600
to target our platform.

34:17.600 --> 34:20.160
What triggered me and really struck me

34:20.160 --> 34:24.040
is when I realized that the example they were given

34:24.040 --> 34:25.760
where they were building an application,

34:25.760 --> 34:28.240
they were building a Linux only application

34:28.240 --> 34:29.320
in Visual Studio.

34:30.200 --> 34:32.640
And then the presenter, she was like,

34:32.640 --> 34:34.640
and then we could also, if we wanted to,

34:34.640 --> 34:36.120
if you wanted to target Windows, you can.

34:36.120 --> 34:38.560
And it's like, wait a minute, wow.

34:38.560 --> 34:41.160
And I thought, well, this just makes it possible

34:41.160 --> 34:42.840
to do all your Linux development

34:42.840 --> 34:45.680
and you never have to run a Linux desktop, ho hum.

34:45.680 --> 34:48.280
But I actually don't think these were ever people

34:48.280 --> 34:50.040
that were likely to switch to the Linux desktop

34:50.040 --> 34:51.440
to begin with.

34:51.440 --> 34:54.000
There is, and we all know this to be true,

34:54.000 --> 34:58.000
an entire world of free software, open source and Linux

34:58.000 --> 35:01.280
that exists that people make lots of money off of

35:01.280 --> 35:03.440
that doesn't involve the desktop world.

35:03.440 --> 35:07.040
You could be employed to write free software

35:07.040 --> 35:08.840
and never run desktop Linux.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.200
In fact, presenters who are contributors

35:11.200 --> 35:14.200
to multiple distributions like Gentoo and Kali Linux

35:14.200 --> 35:16.560
were running Mac OS and they were just running everything

35:16.560 --> 35:18.640
under VMs and Docker containers.

35:18.640 --> 35:19.960
Yeah, I think it's a sort of pragmatism

35:19.960 --> 35:21.440
we need to be more comfortable with.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.040
You know, there's things we kind of want to reactionarily.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.400
There's things we want and there's the way

35:25.400 --> 35:26.440
things actually are.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.000
Right, yeah, exactly.

35:28.000 --> 35:28.840
Here's reality.

35:28.840 --> 35:30.160
And I can also imagine it's useful too,

35:30.160 --> 35:31.680
I mean, just for people that, you know,

35:31.680 --> 35:33.280
you might have Linux at home or you have a Chromebook

35:33.280 --> 35:35.320
that you use on your couch, but your work machine's Windows

35:35.320 --> 35:37.160
because that's what IT provides.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.160
And you just have more abilities now,

35:39.160 --> 35:41.120
regardless of the philosophical implications.

35:41.120 --> 35:42.440
Yeah, you do have.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.960
And for people that were never gonna be able

35:43.960 --> 35:47.280
to switch to Linux, they can now write software for Linux.

35:47.280 --> 35:48.680
And I guess that means we worry

35:48.680 --> 35:50.440
that we lose a little bit of leverage, right?

35:50.440 --> 35:52.400
We have less of a way to say like,

35:52.400 --> 35:53.720
well, you gotta switch to Linux

35:53.720 --> 35:54.880
because we've got all these tools

35:54.880 --> 35:58.480
and now more and more of those are available on Windows.

35:58.480 --> 35:59.320
But you're right.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.520
I don't think that was really that big of a lever

36:01.520 --> 36:02.560
to begin with.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.120
And it's kind of a gross way to do things.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.800
You also saw different projects

36:07.800 --> 36:12.800
trying to tailor their particular project to the subsystem.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.960
So like example, the Penguin folks

36:14.960 --> 36:18.080
seem to be pivoting very hard to graphical environment,

36:18.080 --> 36:21.360
getting X applications and X FCE and Qt applications.

36:21.360 --> 36:22.840
With some impressive results.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.680
Yeah, that seemed to be a big focus for them.

36:25.680 --> 36:28.920
So that's, and then Kali Linux was trying to,

36:28.920 --> 36:31.880
Kali Linux did a presentation about essentially doing

36:31.880 --> 36:34.360
your penetration testing from the subsystem,

36:34.360 --> 36:35.880
from your Windows machine,

36:35.880 --> 36:38.840
which how many corporate guys that are forced to,

36:38.840 --> 36:40.560
and gals that are forced to run Windows.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.520
Right, or you might even wanna run Windows

36:42.520 --> 36:44.000
to run some Windows specific tooling

36:44.000 --> 36:45.760
to target a Windows network.

36:45.760 --> 36:47.120
It might be easier to run the subsystem

36:47.120 --> 36:48.400
than a whole Windows VM.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.520
Obviously this event is about the subsystem,

36:50.520 --> 36:53.600
but there is another star that is shining very bright

36:53.600 --> 36:54.800
in all these conversations.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.400
And it's something Wes and I used the hell out of

36:56.400 --> 36:57.240
in this last week.

36:57.240 --> 36:59.320
And that's the new Windows Terminal.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.160
You've probably heard about

37:00.160 --> 37:01.560
their new open source Windows Terminal.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.760
It's got retro term effects, all of that.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.840
Well, the program manager, Kyla Cinnamon,

37:05.840 --> 37:08.880
joined us to talk a little bit about that.

37:08.880 --> 37:10.280
So just a quick introduction.

37:10.280 --> 37:11.440
My name is Kyla Cinnamon

37:11.440 --> 37:14.320
and I am the program manager on Windows Terminal.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.320
So I work with Terminal every day,

37:16.320 --> 37:18.200
working with the community, working with developers.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.880
And we just wanna make the Terminal

37:19.880 --> 37:22.440
the best command line experience on Windows.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.920
And boy, is it just in every single demo.

37:25.920 --> 37:27.600
And I've been using the crap out of it.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.360
So I wanna talk about your experience

37:29.360 --> 37:30.640
with the Windows Terminal a little bit more.

37:30.640 --> 37:33.420
But it's so obvious how this plays

37:33.420 --> 37:35.840
into their overall strategy for developers now.

37:35.840 --> 37:38.440
It's what they're doing almost wouldn't be possible

37:38.440 --> 37:39.680
without this new Windows Terminal.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.760
It's such a key strategic piece of software

37:41.760 --> 37:44.440
because one of the essential things it does

37:44.440 --> 37:47.360
is this tab system allows you to jump right into a system.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.100
So for example, on my machine,

37:49.100 --> 37:51.640
when I start the Windows Terminal right now,

37:51.640 --> 37:54.200
it starts in an Ubuntu Abash environment,

37:54.200 --> 37:55.580
which is just fantastic.

37:55.580 --> 37:57.920
This is another area where is it suddenly easier

37:57.920 --> 38:00.160
to develop for multiple Linux environments

38:00.160 --> 38:02.040
from Windows than it is on Linux?

38:02.040 --> 38:04.320
I mean, you can set up charutes and all those things,

38:04.320 --> 38:06.060
but this is a tab.

38:06.060 --> 38:07.100
It quite frankly is.

38:07.100 --> 38:10.920
I have three different Linux distributions installed

38:10.920 --> 38:13.200
and I have each one of them in a tab.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.200
I mean, isn't that something?

38:15.200 --> 38:16.660
So Hayden comes back on in a bit

38:16.660 --> 38:18.360
and talks a little more about Ubuntu

38:18.360 --> 38:20.480
on the subsystem in 2020.

38:20.480 --> 38:25.240
On Ubuntu on WSL, we are moving towards Ubuntu 2004,

38:25.240 --> 38:29.320
Focal Fossa, that is the next major Ubuntu LTS,

38:29.320 --> 38:31.340
long-term support release.

38:31.340 --> 38:35.720
And those are the Ubuntu releases we release for WSL.

38:35.720 --> 38:39.240
You've probably seen 16.04, 18.04,

38:39.240 --> 38:43.360
while 20.04 is coming next, that's in April of 2020.

38:43.360 --> 38:47.440
18.04 under WSL 2 is what I was using for this week,

38:47.440 --> 38:50.000
but Hayden shares a little bit of the roadmap

38:50.000 --> 38:53.300
and you can get a feel from his statements here

38:53.300 --> 38:56.140
how seriously Canonical is taking the Windows subsystem

38:56.140 --> 38:59.000
for Linux as a target for Ubuntu.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.120
Ubuntu on WSL is now part

39:02.120 --> 39:04.600
of the official Ubuntu desktop roadmap.

39:04.600 --> 39:08.880
So this is very much part of the fabric of Ubuntu now.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.000
Ubuntu has been staffing up its WSL efforts,

39:12.000 --> 39:17.000
including the addition of Suhini Roy, the product manager,

39:17.480 --> 39:19.960
myself and engineering staff.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.160
Since we had to bail a little early,

39:21.160 --> 39:23.200
I don't feel like I have a complete take on the event

39:23.200 --> 39:25.000
and it's gonna continue tomorrow.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.880
I think overall though, it had less technical issues

39:27.880 --> 39:29.460
than you would expect if you've ever been

39:29.460 --> 39:31.280
in a company meeting where people are sharing

39:31.280 --> 39:32.240
and they have mic issues.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.440
I mean, they changed presentation software

39:34.440 --> 39:36.720
like a day before and it's working.

39:36.720 --> 39:37.560
It did work.

39:37.560 --> 39:41.240
I had to remind myself to participate in the chat

39:41.240 --> 39:42.840
because there was no hallway track.

39:42.840 --> 39:45.220
And I'm typically the guy that just watches

39:45.220 --> 39:46.280
and I never say anything.

39:46.280 --> 39:47.360
I never leave a comment.

39:47.360 --> 39:50.280
I never enter anything in the chat.

39:50.280 --> 39:53.200
And I had to remind myself, you gotta say something

39:53.200 --> 39:54.560
because this is the hallway track.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.800
That's all you're gonna get.

39:55.800 --> 40:00.280
Which I guess I feel like it was a,

40:00.280 --> 40:02.240
the information was conveyed,

40:02.240 --> 40:05.520
but the spirit of the event was a little muted

40:05.520 --> 40:08.960
because it's different when you're presenting

40:08.960 --> 40:11.680
at your computer with a webcam and a headset

40:11.680 --> 40:13.400
than when you're up in front of a room full of people.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.760
You don't have 40 eyes staring at you.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.120
There's a different energy for better or for worse,

40:18.120 --> 40:19.000
quite honestly.

40:19.960 --> 40:22.080
And there's just a different cadence.

40:22.080 --> 40:24.680
Like there maybe was more time in the schedule

40:24.680 --> 40:26.880
than necessary because everybody didn't need

40:26.880 --> 40:29.120
to move around and didn't have to swap out presenters

40:29.120 --> 40:31.480
and set up laptops and get projectors working.

40:31.480 --> 40:33.160
Everybody just pretty much for the most part

40:33.160 --> 40:34.960
just clicked on and started talking,

40:34.960 --> 40:36.320
which was great.

40:36.320 --> 40:38.720
It felt very low key, but very informational.

40:38.720 --> 40:40.600
And it felt like it was definitely targeted

40:40.600 --> 40:41.440
at the right crowd.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.400
People were getting a lot of good stuff

40:43.400 --> 40:45.240
out of every presentation.

40:45.240 --> 40:49.280
And I got a good sense of just how rich this ecosystem is.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.520
I think seeing the demonstration of Kubernetes

40:52.560 --> 40:55.600
and Ansible on WSL, it started like,

40:55.600 --> 40:58.000
oh, this is once this gets on Windows.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.600
And by the way, those demos were on Windows Server.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.480
Once this gets wider deployed on Windows Server,

41:02.480 --> 41:03.320
this could be a big deal.

41:03.320 --> 41:05.360
It's really becoming a legitimate target,

41:05.360 --> 41:06.600
not just for development.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.240
Yeah.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.240
We'll see how tomorrow goes,

41:09.240 --> 41:11.640
but I feel like I've learned a bit.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.960
Now let's talk about having actually used it.

41:13.960 --> 41:16.000
Because having actually used it,

41:16.000 --> 41:18.560
I'm not switching away from Linux anytime soon.

41:18.560 --> 41:21.160
It felt like something I would use

41:21.160 --> 41:22.640
if I didn't have any other option.

41:22.640 --> 41:23.720
I mean, here's the thing.

41:23.720 --> 41:26.120
To use it, you have to first use Windows.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.520
And you can't get around that.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.880
Let's start there.

41:28.880 --> 41:33.160
I didn't enjoy this as much as I was hoping I would.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.960
I thought maybe the time away coming back,

41:34.960 --> 41:36.920
I'd kind of like it a little bit more.

41:37.800 --> 41:38.640
First and foremost,

41:38.640 --> 41:40.320
the first thing that I always have to deal with

41:40.320 --> 41:42.040
on a Windows machine after I set it up

41:42.040 --> 41:45.120
is there's just way too many power options.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.440
Just way too much going on.

41:46.440 --> 41:47.640
The defaults are dumb.

41:47.640 --> 41:49.160
And then there's different sleep modes.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.160
There's sleep, there's hybrid sleep,

41:51.160 --> 41:53.520
there's hibernate, there's suspend.

41:54.360 --> 41:56.560
There's like fake shutdown, fastboot stuff.

41:56.560 --> 41:57.440
Yeah.

41:57.440 --> 41:59.040
It's too much.

41:59.040 --> 42:00.760
And I just hate having to fiddle with it.

42:00.760 --> 42:03.280
And the control panel is a freaking dumpster fire.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.080
However, the search has gotten pretty good.

42:05.080 --> 42:06.920
So if you just search for stuff, you find most of it.

42:06.920 --> 42:08.440
That is a nice surprise really,

42:08.440 --> 42:10.480
is I can just adopt the Linux workflow I have

42:10.480 --> 42:13.520
of Windows key and whatever I want to run.

42:13.520 --> 42:16.440
I was impressed how front and center the Linux stuff was

42:16.440 --> 42:18.280
in the Microsoft store.

42:18.280 --> 42:19.720
There's a whole Linux section.

42:19.720 --> 42:20.760
It's right there.

42:21.640 --> 42:22.480
Linux.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.440
All the Linux stuff.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.640
And I was like, whoa, they got like a big old logo,

42:25.640 --> 42:27.280
a banner for it.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.840
Like they're really embracing it.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.000
They're not hiding it at all.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.640
Right, I mean, you heard in one of those clips,

42:31.640 --> 42:34.000
thanking the distros for showing up.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.600
They're clearly excited about this ecosystem.

42:36.600 --> 42:39.280
If you want to go with WSL2, it's still a little rocky.

42:39.280 --> 42:41.160
It's clearly not fully released yet.

42:41.160 --> 42:43.760
Like I installed Ubuntu, but I didn't have WSL2.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.280
So then it didn't activate properly.

42:45.280 --> 42:46.640
So then I had to install WSL2,

42:46.640 --> 42:49.000
which didn't link me to the right information.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.520
I had to search for it myself.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.720
And then I had to rerun Ubuntu to get it all working.

42:52.720 --> 42:55.160
Had to be pretty dedicated to getting WSL2.

42:55.160 --> 42:56.000
That's basically it.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.400
I was like, okay, I'm really doing this.

42:58.400 --> 43:00.800
But once you have it up and installed,

43:00.800 --> 43:02.600
you got something kind of special.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.200
Like you combine that with the Windows terminal

43:04.200 --> 43:07.000
and you tell it just to jump right into the Ubuntu system.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.760
And the terminal takes longer than I'd like to launch,

43:09.760 --> 43:11.800
but once it's launched, it's fine.

43:11.800 --> 43:13.800
You know, those integrations are impressive

43:13.800 --> 43:15.880
and just something you can do when you control

43:15.880 --> 43:18.160
the whole stack that we don't always see on Linux.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.560
You know, you're just like, oh, right,

43:19.560 --> 43:21.080
you designed both parts.

43:21.080 --> 43:23.160
And so they work really well together.

43:23.160 --> 43:25.080
So I was thinking about why I didn't enjoy it as much.

43:25.080 --> 43:26.840
Because the Mac, I was like, oh, this is kind of fun.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.640
This is better than I expected, right?

43:28.640 --> 43:30.000
And what my experience so far,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.440
although it's been less time with Windows,

43:32.440 --> 43:35.560
has been this is exactly what I expected.

43:35.560 --> 43:37.840
And I had to think about it like I like to do these days.

43:37.840 --> 43:39.760
You know, I was on a walk with the old dog.

43:39.760 --> 43:41.640
Levi helps me work through these things better than you.

43:41.640 --> 43:42.480
It's always good to think about

43:42.480 --> 43:43.800
what you're gonna say before you say it.

43:43.800 --> 43:45.280
It is.

43:45.280 --> 43:46.520
I find that does fun.

43:46.520 --> 43:48.400
And also, Levi's a really good listener.

43:48.400 --> 43:49.800
You know, I get good feedback from him.

43:49.800 --> 43:50.840
Great questions.

43:50.840 --> 43:55.480
So Windows has really good big apps.

43:55.480 --> 43:57.840
You know, big enterprise apps, big commercial apps,

43:57.840 --> 43:58.920
like the Adobe stuff.

43:58.920 --> 44:00.760
It's got all of the standard work apps

44:00.760 --> 44:02.880
you'd need to participate in a workspace.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.680
It's got your Outlooks.

44:04.680 --> 44:07.040
It's got really good big apps.

44:07.040 --> 44:09.800
And I think if that's your need,

44:09.800 --> 44:11.680
it's sort of the, it's the champ there.

44:11.680 --> 44:12.520
And that's just something

44:12.520 --> 44:14.000
that Linux can't compete at right now

44:14.000 --> 44:16.880
because there's just not that same range of apps.

44:16.880 --> 44:21.360
But the fun little third-party tweak at utilities

44:21.360 --> 44:25.600
that I was poppin' like pills on Mac OS

44:25.600 --> 44:28.600
don't really quite exist the same for Windows.

44:28.600 --> 44:32.080
There's some, but they're more like fiddly little odd ones

44:32.080 --> 44:34.400
that look like Windows apps from 100 years ago

44:34.400 --> 44:38.120
or they're laced with totally wicked wild UIs.

44:38.120 --> 44:41.000
And they don't feel so much like clever tools

44:41.000 --> 44:44.360
that take advantage of built-in hidden API features

44:44.360 --> 44:45.800
that are ingrained into the OS.

44:45.800 --> 44:48.200
They feel more like hardcore tweaks

44:48.200 --> 44:49.720
that are altering the way Windows works.

44:49.720 --> 44:50.560
Right, I mean, you're like,

44:50.560 --> 44:52.040
this is kind of a hack, isn't it?

44:52.040 --> 44:53.920
It works, but it's kind of a hack.

44:53.920 --> 44:58.280
And they're just, they're not as fun.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.280
I know that seems silly, but,

45:00.280 --> 45:03.880
so on the Mac, and like it is when I distro hop

45:03.880 --> 45:05.560
every single time, and I think that's one of the reasons

45:05.560 --> 45:08.200
I like it, it's like a fun exploration

45:08.200 --> 45:10.400
of, oh, I can do this, oh, I can do this.

45:10.400 --> 45:13.880
Like every time I switch back to a desktop environment

45:13.880 --> 45:14.960
that I haven't used in years,

45:14.960 --> 45:17.640
when we recently tried Cinnamon, for example,

45:17.640 --> 45:19.120
I was like, oh yeah, I can do this.

45:19.120 --> 45:20.580
Oh, this is great.

45:21.840 --> 45:23.160
That's not how I feel in Windows.

45:23.160 --> 45:24.920
In Windows, it feels like a damn task.

45:24.920 --> 45:26.800
Like, oh, I've got to do this.

45:26.800 --> 45:28.600
Oh, now I've got to do this.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.000
Oh, now I've got to do this.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.720
And then once I get through all that crap, I have it.

45:33.720 --> 45:34.800
And it's okay, it's fine.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.600
It's got multiple virtual desktops now,

45:36.600 --> 45:37.560
which I think is pretty good.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.840
It's got, I could slam Windows into corners

45:39.840 --> 45:41.040
using the keyboard commands.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.680
It's, you know, it's funny enough,

45:43.680 --> 45:45.160
it's pretty good at doing Windows.

45:45.160 --> 45:47.600
Windows are fast, it pops them right up on the screen.

45:47.600 --> 45:50.360
We've had that nice snapping support for a long time now.

45:50.360 --> 45:55.080
Yeah, so once you get through the slog,

45:55.080 --> 45:56.720
well, all right, okay, all right.

45:56.720 --> 45:59.040
I mean, like the updates are still unpleasant.

45:59.040 --> 46:00.040
So much hasn't changed.

46:00.040 --> 46:01.320
And if anything, the settings

46:01.320 --> 46:03.520
and like control panel stuff is worse now.

46:03.520 --> 46:05.360
Yeah, and the file system's underwhelming,

46:05.360 --> 46:06.600
which it does matter to me.

46:06.600 --> 46:09.360
It doesn't matter to most users, but it matters to me.

46:11.480 --> 46:13.320
So I was trying to think of what I could learn.

46:13.320 --> 46:15.300
Like what I learned on the Mac experience

46:15.300 --> 46:18.240
was that Linux needs a healthy third-party app ecosystem

46:18.240 --> 46:20.880
if we want to avoid an Electron future.

46:20.880 --> 46:22.040
And I was trying to think, okay,

46:22.040 --> 46:23.640
well, what am I learning from the Windows experience?

46:23.640 --> 46:25.240
And what I'm learning from the Windows experience

46:25.240 --> 46:27.500
is we need to be a good tool for people.

46:28.580 --> 46:30.280
We need to provide a good utility

46:30.280 --> 46:32.600
that is predictable and reliable.

46:32.600 --> 46:34.360
But I think we're gonna get there in our own way

46:34.360 --> 46:36.280
with things like snapshots

46:36.280 --> 46:38.820
and the different kind of like improvements

46:38.820 --> 46:40.360
that we're seeing to the desktop environments,

46:40.360 --> 46:42.380
especially Gnome Shell and Plasma,

46:42.380 --> 46:44.420
and some of the app picks we're about to talk about.

46:44.420 --> 46:45.560
We're gonna get there,

46:45.560 --> 46:48.600
but we're getting there in sort of the Linux way,

46:48.600 --> 46:50.440
where Windows sort of started from that point.

46:50.440 --> 46:53.240
They started as a business purpose OS.

46:53.240 --> 46:55.000
And when you look at it from that way,

46:55.000 --> 46:58.040
when you look at what the whole point of the NT desktop was,

46:58.040 --> 47:00.120
it was to be a business workstation.

47:00.120 --> 47:01.480
And it makes a little more sense,

47:01.480 --> 47:03.280
especially when you consider the history of XP

47:03.280 --> 47:05.040
and how long it was around.

47:05.040 --> 47:06.960
Yeah, I don't know how we compete with that

47:06.960 --> 47:08.640
other than just trying to make our tools better,

47:08.640 --> 47:10.480
trying to make it a better and better workstation.

47:10.480 --> 47:13.200
Right, and there are those users that see already,

47:13.200 --> 47:14.920
Linux can get out of your way a little bit more

47:14.920 --> 47:18.340
than Windows can, and it might become more popular.

47:18.340 --> 47:21.660
So by then, they have a pretty decent multiple desktop,

47:21.660 --> 47:23.760
virtual desktop implementation, don't they?

47:23.760 --> 47:27.120
Yeah, but I find myself not using it that much.

47:27.120 --> 47:32.120
I'm more a guy of multiple screens and use it that way.

47:33.400 --> 47:34.640
I think when I just use Windows,

47:34.640 --> 47:36.080
I kind of don't think to use it.

47:36.080 --> 47:38.920
So I intentionally put some of my chat applications

47:38.920 --> 47:39.900
on different desktops,

47:39.900 --> 47:41.640
so that way I had to move over to see them.

47:41.640 --> 47:42.480
Get used to it.

47:42.480 --> 47:44.120
Get a terminal on a different one.

47:44.120 --> 47:45.360
So I think I could build the habit up

47:45.360 --> 47:47.320
just like I have on other desktop environments.

47:47.320 --> 47:49.320
And it's nice that it is built in,

47:49.320 --> 47:52.760
and it is a very quick, it's high performance.

47:52.760 --> 47:55.240
They're thinking way back to Windows.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.600
I will say it feels very stable.

47:57.600 --> 47:59.960
There's no weird lag in Explorer anymore,

47:59.960 --> 48:00.800
random problems.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.520
Well, we both are using fresh installs, though.

48:02.520 --> 48:03.400
That's a caveat.

48:03.400 --> 48:04.360
Okay, yeah, true.

48:04.360 --> 48:07.080
One week's not really enough to turn everything up.

48:07.080 --> 48:09.840
If we were doing this, if this was a year-long thing,

48:09.840 --> 48:12.480
which we could not survive, but if it was,

48:12.480 --> 48:15.360
there's no way it'd be as performant as it is, right?

48:15.360 --> 48:17.600
Isn't that just sort of, isn't that still true with Windows?

48:17.600 --> 48:19.640
I guess we're gonna have to find out.

48:19.640 --> 48:21.160
Well, I mean, you'd have to use it.

48:21.160 --> 48:22.000
I don't want to.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.480
I don't really want to.

48:23.480 --> 48:25.480
Do we have any volunteers from the audience?

48:25.480 --> 48:26.640
There must be people out there that,

48:26.640 --> 48:28.840
can you confirm if Windows 10 still suffers from that?

48:28.840 --> 48:29.840
Because I think it's just inherent

48:29.840 --> 48:32.300
to how Windows is designed, but what do I know?

48:34.240 --> 48:36.980
I guess here's another way to reframe

48:36.980 --> 48:39.240
this whole conversation that is also sort of reflective

48:39.240 --> 48:43.640
of my experience of WSL Conf so far.

48:43.640 --> 48:46.020
If you were always gonna be on the Windows platform,

48:46.020 --> 48:48.000
it is a better experience than it's ever been,

48:48.000 --> 48:50.300
and I say that as a bit of a Windows critic,

48:50.300 --> 48:52.380
but when you look at the work they're doing,

48:52.380 --> 48:54.240
their browser is competitive again.

48:54.240 --> 48:56.160
Their terminal is competitive again.

48:56.160 --> 48:57.960
The subsystem for Linux is looking

48:57.960 --> 48:59.600
like a really good piece of kit.

48:59.600 --> 49:02.320
Docker is really working on supporting the hell out of it,

49:02.320 --> 49:04.280
so essentially anything you can run in Docker,

49:04.280 --> 49:05.960
you can run on the subsystem.

49:05.960 --> 49:08.560
Canonical is focusing on it as a primary target

49:08.560 --> 49:10.120
for the Ubuntu platform.

49:10.120 --> 49:13.120
Kali Linux is targeting it as a primary target for them.

49:13.120 --> 49:16.260
It's clear that there is an ecosystem

49:16.260 --> 49:17.800
already building around this thing,

49:17.800 --> 49:20.160
and they haven't even gotten the second version out yet.

49:20.160 --> 49:22.640
So it's better than it's ever been for Windows users,

49:22.640 --> 49:26.780
and I think that's gonna lead to more Linux software.

49:26.780 --> 49:29.200
I think we will actually see more contributors

49:29.200 --> 49:30.600
to open source and free software

49:30.600 --> 49:33.880
because people won't have to leave their comfort zone

49:33.880 --> 49:36.640
or their mandated operating system to contribute now.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.720
I mean, it's gotta be better if more people are aware

49:38.720 --> 49:39.560
of Linux, right?

49:39.560 --> 49:41.680
You know, you start working on these Windows tooling,

49:41.680 --> 49:44.800
Linux is suddenly an easy, available, marketed option

49:44.800 --> 49:47.040
for you, and you're naturally, at some point,

49:47.040 --> 49:49.080
at least gonna wonder, oh, maybe I can use this

49:49.080 --> 49:50.000
in other areas of my life.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.320
Maybe you suddenly deploy a Raspberry Pi running Linux

49:52.320 --> 49:55.280
at home or explore the Linux desktop a little bit

49:55.280 --> 49:56.720
on that spare laptop that you have.

49:56.720 --> 49:58.460
Yeah, and you're already more familiar

49:58.460 --> 50:00.680
with the command line, so you've got an idea

50:00.680 --> 50:01.800
of what some of the commands are.

50:01.800 --> 50:03.240
Colonel, you have real-time follow-up

50:03.240 --> 50:05.400
on the Windows lag issue?

50:05.400 --> 50:08.200
Yeah, so due to college classes,

50:08.200 --> 50:10.760
I'm required to use Windows for certain things.

50:11.600 --> 50:15.760
I keep it in a VM, but even so, every time I run updates,

50:15.760 --> 50:17.760
it just seems to get slower and slower.

50:17.760 --> 50:21.360
I've actually taken to having a gold image

50:21.360 --> 50:25.620
that I then, it's the fresh install,

50:25.620 --> 50:30.000
and I run the updates on that, clone it off, and use it,

50:30.000 --> 50:34.360
and I snapshot that so that every time I go to run updates,

50:34.360 --> 50:36.320
it's coming from a fresh install.

50:36.320 --> 50:39.160
Otherwise, it starts slowing down like crazy.

50:39.160 --> 50:40.440
Interesting, okay.

50:40.440 --> 50:43.600
Yeah, I have a pretty recent build

50:43.600 --> 50:46.420
because I'm on the fast track, and I got the Insider ISO,

50:46.420 --> 50:48.160
so I haven't had to experience a lot of updates

50:48.160 --> 50:50.240
because it came pretty fresh.

50:50.240 --> 50:54.280
I have not this go-around played with Chocolaty,

50:54.280 --> 50:57.960
but Chocolaty is, it is like brute is to the Mac.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.420
It is a package manager for Windows,

51:00.420 --> 51:02.760
and last time around, I did a Windows test

51:02.760 --> 51:05.120
like two, three years ago.

51:06.440 --> 51:08.200
Maybe it wasn't even that long ago.

51:08.200 --> 51:10.040
Maybe a year ago, I tried out Chocolaty,

51:10.040 --> 51:11.200
and I was really impressed by it.

51:11.200 --> 51:12.520
Yeah, I installed it.

51:12.520 --> 51:13.680
I mean, almost just out of habit,

51:13.680 --> 51:15.120
I kind of think to myself, okay, Windows,

51:15.120 --> 51:17.320
let's get a package manager on there.

51:17.320 --> 51:19.680
And is there something like, is there like a go-to package

51:19.680 --> 51:21.200
that you install after you load it,

51:21.200 --> 51:22.760
or is it just you want to have it

51:22.760 --> 51:24.400
because you know you might call upon it?

51:24.400 --> 51:26.480
It just sort of helps complete the picture, you know?

51:26.480 --> 51:28.400
Like, I just expect that to be a part

51:28.400 --> 51:31.880
of an operating system, and I hate the sort of traditional,

51:31.880 --> 51:33.320
like, am I going to go around

51:33.320 --> 51:35.960
and go grab all these things individually?

51:35.960 --> 51:36.840
No, I can't do that.

51:36.840 --> 51:38.040
I'm not going to do that.

51:38.040 --> 51:43.040
And the default command prompt feels so just basic, and-

51:44.160 --> 51:46.720
I mean, they had to, that's why you needed this new terminal.

51:46.720 --> 51:48.480
Yeah, yeah, they really had to do this.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.640
I will say, using the new terminal,

51:50.640 --> 51:51.760
and I was trying to like,

51:51.760 --> 51:53.960
I did play around with the subsystem, obviously,

51:53.960 --> 51:55.440
but I was trying to use PowerShell 2

51:55.440 --> 51:58.320
just because, I mean, we're using Windows, right?

51:58.320 --> 52:00.800
I had to use it a little bit just to get WSL 2 working.

52:00.800 --> 52:04.680
It does, I mean, it's modern, you know?

52:04.680 --> 52:05.840
Even though there is plenty,

52:05.840 --> 52:10.060
especially in parts of the UI that has that Windows legacy,

52:11.120 --> 52:14.160
the command line is starting to feel first class.

52:14.160 --> 52:15.400
Yeah, I agree.

52:15.400 --> 52:18.040
And their new terminal adds, like,

52:18.040 --> 52:21.160
some nice search features that are similar

52:21.160 --> 52:22.800
to how you would search for something in a web browser.

52:22.800 --> 52:25.200
It can search back through your whole command line log.

52:25.200 --> 52:27.040
And then they've added silly things

52:27.040 --> 52:28.600
like the cool retro term.

52:28.600 --> 52:30.120
And then, of course, you can open up a terminal

52:30.120 --> 52:31.440
and have a tab that's in Ubuntu,

52:31.440 --> 52:33.640
a tab that's in Debian, and a tab that's in OpenSUSE,

52:33.640 --> 52:34.480
and a tab that's in Kali Linux,

52:34.480 --> 52:36.160
and a tab that's on the Windows command line,

52:36.160 --> 52:38.160
and a tab that's in PowerShell.

52:38.160 --> 52:39.160
It's pretty crazy.

52:39.160 --> 52:41.080
You could be running three or four Linux distros

52:41.080 --> 52:43.120
simultaneously.

52:43.120 --> 52:44.600
And you sit there and go, wow,

52:44.600 --> 52:46.760
that's something that's even hard to do on Linux itself.

52:46.760 --> 52:49.600
And look at Microsoft shipping it.

52:49.600 --> 52:52.520
Didn't really kind of make me go,

52:52.520 --> 52:54.600
well, all right, I'm done with Linux then.

52:54.600 --> 52:55.840
I'm gonna switch this.

52:55.840 --> 52:57.600
I'll do all, I love the Linux command line.

52:57.600 --> 52:59.320
I'll run it here, and I'll use the Windows UI

52:59.320 --> 53:00.680
and have all my Steam games.

53:00.680 --> 53:03.400
I thought like there was a risk of that for me

53:03.400 --> 53:05.600
because it'd be kind of nice to, you know,

53:05.600 --> 53:08.680
just have a really great desktop that has a,

53:08.680 --> 53:09.880
everybody talks about the Mac,

53:09.880 --> 53:11.080
how it's a great desktop

53:11.080 --> 53:13.320
with a real Unix terminal underneath.

53:13.320 --> 53:15.880
Well, here's a desktop with a Linux terminal underneath.

53:15.880 --> 53:18.160
No, no, it just still doesn't do it for me.

53:18.160 --> 53:19.280
It's the whole package.

53:19.280 --> 53:21.280
There's still too much Windows,

53:21.280 --> 53:24.560
and there is still weird Windows cruft lurking.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.920
You didn't have to go through the installation part,

53:26.920 --> 53:28.320
but I did.

53:28.320 --> 53:29.680
I mean, that's just unpleasant.

53:29.680 --> 53:32.600
The weird magic, the strange GUIDs everywhere.

53:32.600 --> 53:34.960
It's just such a foreign ecosystem,

53:34.960 --> 53:37.840
and I'm really grateful I don't need it.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.000
I'm glad that it's becoming more useful.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.440
That just seems like a good thing.

53:42.440 --> 53:44.600
But the dynamic is clear

53:44.600 --> 53:47.040
because we're Linux users coming to Windows,

53:47.040 --> 53:49.440
and we're going, oh, this stuff's all different.

53:49.440 --> 53:51.280
But if the situation was reversed

53:51.280 --> 53:55.120
and we were Windows users first coming to Linux,

53:55.120 --> 53:58.040
what they have now is so much more functional

53:58.040 --> 54:00.120
and it would be so much more appealing to me.

54:00.120 --> 54:03.240
I think for their customer base,

54:03.240 --> 54:06.760
for what they're targeting, they have fricking nailed it.

54:06.760 --> 54:09.080
And I'm not worried about it taking away Linux users

54:09.080 --> 54:10.720
because I think ultimately it'll make people

54:10.720 --> 54:12.640
more familiar with the Linux command line,

54:12.640 --> 54:16.520
and it will result in more people contributing to software.

54:16.520 --> 54:19.360
And I think ultimately it will lead to more Linux users

54:19.360 --> 54:21.720
because the Windows experience is still very much Windows,

54:21.720 --> 54:22.560
but this just shows you

54:22.560 --> 54:24.200
how much more power there is out there.

54:24.200 --> 54:25.560
And when you can tap into that,

54:25.560 --> 54:28.040
when you get involved in the communities,

54:28.040 --> 54:29.680
it's actually, it's just gonna be one more thing

54:29.680 --> 54:31.080
that draws people in.

54:31.080 --> 54:33.160
Kind of actually think it's a great thing overall.

54:33.160 --> 54:36.520
And I had a note that I wrote down like I do now

54:36.520 --> 54:39.220
on my old paper tab here, and I thought to myself,

54:41.120 --> 54:44.480
the way to explain what Microsoft is doing here

54:44.480 --> 54:49.480
is they say they love Linux and they love open source.

54:50.160 --> 54:51.600
But what it is is as a business,

54:51.600 --> 54:54.360
they've come up with a very clever way to monetize.

54:54.360 --> 54:57.920
Just like it's a cliche thing, but when this,

54:57.920 --> 55:00.500
if you wanna understand Microsoft's motivation,

55:00.500 --> 55:04.720
it comes down to one classic American cliche.

55:04.720 --> 55:08.000
And that is they are selling the picks, axes, and shovels

55:08.000 --> 55:09.720
to the gold miners.

55:09.720 --> 55:10.560
That's what they're doing.

55:10.560 --> 55:13.640
That's what Azure is, that's what VS Code is,

55:13.640 --> 55:15.280
that's what WSL is.

55:15.280 --> 55:19.380
They are tools for people that are in the gold rush,

55:19.380 --> 55:21.340
which is writing web applications

55:21.340 --> 55:23.240
in modern open source software.

55:23.240 --> 55:25.260
They are providing the tools.

55:25.260 --> 55:26.240
It's a brilliant strategy.

55:26.240 --> 55:27.080
It really is.

55:27.080 --> 55:29.960
And the whole thing, especially attending WSL Conf,

55:29.960 --> 55:32.840
is there wasn't a lot of discussion about licenses

55:32.840 --> 55:36.040
or philosophy, it's a pragmatic attitude.

55:36.040 --> 55:38.280
And sort of the change at Microsoft was dropping

55:38.280 --> 55:41.660
that anti-Linux philosophy and just realizing

55:41.660 --> 55:43.120
if we support more platforms,

55:43.120 --> 55:44.880
that's more places to sell our languages

55:44.880 --> 55:47.560
and our tooling and enterprise support contracts.

55:47.560 --> 55:49.600
And that's what they've done, and it's been very successful.

55:49.600 --> 55:53.240
Yes, and so their motivation is to continue this.

55:53.240 --> 55:57.160
That's their, and that's why it's not some secret plan

55:57.160 --> 56:01.000
to take over the Linux desktop and lock down everything.

56:01.000 --> 56:04.420
It's simply they wanna sell as many shovels as they can

56:04.420 --> 56:06.040
while the gold rush is in full swing,

56:06.040 --> 56:07.800
and they wanna capture that market.

56:07.800 --> 56:10.880
And by the way, have you tried Azure?

56:10.880 --> 56:12.940
Because there's some long-term revenue possibilities there,

56:12.940 --> 56:15.680
and it just, all this just plugs in real nice.

56:15.680 --> 56:16.760
I think it's a good strategy,

56:16.760 --> 56:18.280
and I think it's pretty easy to understand.

56:18.280 --> 56:20.360
And I think really the conversation

56:20.360 --> 56:22.000
around what's Microsoft's motivation

56:22.000 --> 56:24.280
and why are they doing this needs to come to an end.

56:24.280 --> 56:26.240
We just need to, we need to move past this

56:26.240 --> 56:28.000
and realize this is the new reality,

56:28.000 --> 56:31.400
because there are individuals that work at Microsoft now

56:31.400 --> 56:34.560
that have only ever worked there since it's been this way.

56:34.560 --> 56:35.840
Think about how that will over time

56:35.840 --> 56:37.100
change a company culture.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.360
It's pretty wild.

56:39.360 --> 56:41.760
It, for me, I mean, maybe I'm getting old,

56:41.760 --> 56:44.880
but I just, I remember visiting the Microsoft campus

56:44.880 --> 56:48.440
back in the late 80s, right after Windows 98 was released,

56:48.440 --> 56:49.620
things were on fire,

56:49.620 --> 56:51.840
and Microsoft was on top of the world.

56:51.840 --> 56:55.420
And they are now in a totally different position,

56:55.420 --> 56:58.320
and they've really figured out how to make it work for them.

56:59.480 --> 57:02.280
I'm looking forward to see what WSL day two has.

57:02.280 --> 57:03.680
Oh, yeah, I think there's a lot more to come

57:03.680 --> 57:06.880
out of this conference and the Microsoft and Linux ecosystem.

57:06.880 --> 57:09.080
Yeah, and in the meantime, in the meantime,

57:09.080 --> 57:10.040
I'm just gonna take advantage

57:10.040 --> 57:12.000
of all the great new software that'll run on Linux

57:12.000 --> 57:13.520
and be grateful for that.

57:13.520 --> 57:15.840
And when I do have to run Windows,

57:15.840 --> 57:17.760
first thing I do is get the subsystem going

57:17.760 --> 57:20.560
and get the latest Ubuntu environment installed.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.800
And I'm sitting there doing a Hapt update.

57:22.800 --> 57:23.640
And you know what?

57:23.640 --> 57:24.680
I can tell it's a little slower.

57:24.680 --> 57:26.280
It is a little bit slower, isn't it, Wes?

57:26.280 --> 57:27.560
Did you notice it's a little slower?

57:27.560 --> 57:28.400
Yeah, okay, a little bit.

57:28.400 --> 57:30.640
Yeah, it is a little bit slower, but it's there.

57:30.640 --> 57:32.280
That's how you tell it's not real.

57:32.280 --> 57:37.280
I'm curious of the overall impact on the Windows host

57:37.960 --> 57:42.400
when you're running all of these WSL environments

57:42.400 --> 57:44.560
in the new terminal, like you were talking about,

57:44.560 --> 57:47.520
you were running Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE,

57:48.600 --> 57:49.840
and all these distributions.

57:49.840 --> 57:53.440
How does that impact the system itself?

57:53.440 --> 57:55.480
Do you notice a significant slowdown?

57:55.480 --> 57:59.120
Do you notice some herky-jerky action going on there?

57:59.120 --> 58:01.480
So when they're just sitting there idle,

58:01.480 --> 58:02.320
and Kelly was the other one,

58:02.320 --> 58:03.640
when they're just sitting there idle,

58:03.640 --> 58:06.280
it's pretty much just whatever memory bash takes.

58:06.280 --> 58:08.240
It's very, very low impact.

58:08.240 --> 58:10.120
If you start doing a lot of things,

58:10.120 --> 58:12.760
like you start spinning up environments inside there,

58:12.760 --> 58:14.880
you start actually adding a lot of software

58:14.880 --> 58:15.720
and things like that,

58:15.720 --> 58:17.480
it seems like the performance

58:17.480 --> 58:20.080
kind of starts to drop off a cliff a little bit,

58:20.080 --> 58:21.640
and that was definitely prevalent

58:21.640 --> 58:23.280
in the demonstrations we saw today too.

58:23.280 --> 58:25.880
Like when they were spinning up Kubernetes clusters

58:25.880 --> 58:28.800
inside WSL, things definitely slowed down.

58:28.800 --> 58:33.320
Right, or if you launched all of those WSL environments

58:33.320 --> 58:35.240
and updated each one at the same time,

58:35.240 --> 58:37.480
I'm sure that would significantly impact the host.

58:37.480 --> 58:39.720
But to that end, like when I launched the terminal

58:39.720 --> 58:41.080
and those tabs preload,

58:41.080 --> 58:42.760
it just almost happens immediately.

58:42.760 --> 58:44.280
It's not like you're sitting there

58:44.280 --> 58:45.800
waiting for them to spin up.

58:45.800 --> 58:47.080
And I know Microsoft's done a lot of work

58:47.080 --> 58:49.000
to sort of craft a well-integrated

58:49.000 --> 58:52.240
and super minimal sort of Hyper-V setup for WSL too.

58:52.240 --> 58:53.240
Yeah, yeah.

58:53.240 --> 58:55.880
And I think you're gonna see a lot of projects

58:55.880 --> 58:57.520
that will shift support over for it

58:57.520 --> 58:58.720
and get serious about it.

58:58.720 --> 59:01.000
I mean, Docker Desktop looked really good,

59:01.000 --> 59:02.480
and Penguin, for example,

59:02.480 --> 59:05.000
making it super easy with an end curses.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.640
So it starts, you get in the Penguin environment,

59:06.640 --> 59:09.160
there's an end curses prompt to get X11 working,

59:09.160 --> 59:11.680
and you can get a full Qt development environment going

59:11.680 --> 59:16.560
with X11, XFCE, it's pretty nice.

59:16.560 --> 59:19.240
And it's all just walks you right through it.

59:19.240 --> 59:21.600
You don't have to be an expert on getting that stuff going.

59:21.600 --> 59:24.360
And I'm very impressed by what the different projects

59:24.360 --> 59:25.680
are doing to stay competitive.

59:25.680 --> 59:29.360
I think I heard that Ubuntu will officially support

59:29.360 --> 59:31.440
their distro for WSL too.

59:31.440 --> 59:32.960
Yeah, that was something Hayden touched on.

59:32.960 --> 59:36.280
It's on their roadmap now, and it's an official target.

59:36.280 --> 59:38.000
Speaking of which, I need to get Ubuntu installed

59:38.000 --> 59:39.600
on this laptop now.

59:39.600 --> 59:41.040
Maybe rather fast too.

59:41.040 --> 59:43.880
Yeah, we've got some work for after the show.

59:43.880 --> 59:46.920
Okay, so we have two pics to cover before we go.

59:46.920 --> 59:49.520
Number one is if you have been lured

59:49.520 --> 59:51.000
into using Google Photos,

59:51.000 --> 59:55.360
that handy, super useful, incredible tool

59:55.360 --> 59:56.200
called Google Photos.

59:56.200 --> 59:57.040
I mean, it is.

59:57.040 --> 59:58.240
It's so handy and easy.

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.200
And if you're a pixel user, they just give you storage.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.160
Your friends are on there,

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.440
so you can share albums really easily.

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:04.640
It's the best search.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.240
Christmas tree and dog,

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.360
and it shows me all the pictures with Levi

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.240
in front of the Christmas tree.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.240
I mean, it's just something.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.800
RV, I just searched for RV,

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.680
all the pictures of lady jupes just come up.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.680
It's just, so, but you know, it's gooks.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:17.920
And maybe you wanna switch off,

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.440
but you gotta get all your photos out of there.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.480
Or maybe you just wanna have your own.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.840
For when eventually they shut it down.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.680
You wanna have your own stash?

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.840
Yeah, they're gonna shut it down.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.160
Or you just want your own copy.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.120
Well, you can safely back up your Google Photos

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.480
with our app pick this week.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.560
It's really simple.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.040
You can install it as a snap too,

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.160
because our buddy, Mr. Popey snapped it up.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.360
It's called G Photo Sync.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.040
It's probably in your repo or it's a snap.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.360
It's gphotos-sync, photos with an S dash sync,

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.160
just snap install gphotos sync.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.080
And then you run that and it pulls down all your photos

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.920
right off the old Google Photos.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.840
You know, he's got a great post written up about this tool.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.200
My only issue is we didn't get any fun photos.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.480
Yeah.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.920
He did have one in the tweet about it.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.240
That's actually maybe what's his,

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.440
he had a picture of his cat made me click it.

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.120
So, okay, he knows what's going on.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.400
He knows what's up for the tweet.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.480
And then our second app pick this week is,

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.440
you know, we talked a lot about Docker and WSL integration

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.600
and how Windows is doing all this.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.080
Well, let's show them one better.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.800
Let's show them how Plasma does it.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.920
So this is a Plasmoid for managing your Docker containers.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.180
Now listen, I know not all of you use Docker,

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.640
but this is really nice because it's a little menu

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.240
right there with a graphical environment

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.840
that shows you the status of your different containers.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.400
I don't know where this accent's coming from,

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.320
but it won't go away.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.960
And you can start and stop them right there.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.160
You can jump into an environment.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.040
You can take notes, edit them right there.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:39.080
What do you think of that, Wes?

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.040
Isn't that nice?

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.520
Yeah, I tried to get it installed before the show.

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.360
On your Plasma?

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.760
Uh-huh, but it needed a couple build dependencies.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:46.840
And for whatever reason,

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.440
the KDE Store links weren't loading.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.280
Damn it, Wes.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.600
But hopefully by the time you see this,

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.440
you can give it a try.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.280
Because I was curious,

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.840
and especially if you're only running a couple containers,

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.500
you don't need any complicated management, that's perfect.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.340
I think it is.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.160
I think it's, I don't know,

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.280
we'll put a link in the old show notes

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.960
if you could use one of them two tools.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.480
That's where you'll get them.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.520
Check it out.

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.720
Linuxunplugged.com slash 344.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.720
That's right there.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.040
Links to everything we talked about today.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.080
Well, Wes, what do you say?

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.120
You about ready to pack it up

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.720
and go install Ubuntu water machines

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.080
and go back to the conference?

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.120
More than ready.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.560
All right, well, we will be live, hopefully,

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.400
if all goes as planned.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.080
I'll be from Denver.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.620
I'll sneak out.

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.840
I'll be down there for like one day.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.160
So I'll probably spend the morning

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.520
with the elementary OS guys

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.920
and sneak out to do a lot.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.200
Maybe I could bring one of them with me back to the RV.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.520
Take a prisoner.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.200
I should, right?

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.020
That'd be fun.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.800
So check out that at jblive.tv,

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.200
jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar for the live time.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.280
But, of course, as we always do,

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.840
we'll release the edited version

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.560
with the audio all cleaned up,

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.840
as our excellent editor, Mr. Joe Resington, does every time.

And I'm at Chris Lass on the Twitter.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.840
Thanks so much for tuning in this week's episode

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.920
of the Unplugged program.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.680
Oh, go check out the Ubuntu podcast.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.680
Rumor has it's coming back soon.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.520
Go get subscribed over there.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:16.360
Ooh.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.160
And we'll see you next Tuesday!

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:28.000
The Unplugged.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:57.960
Unplugged program, 344, all right, JBtitles.com, the bot is up in the

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.040
running and we've got lots of good title suggestions, so let's go pick our title.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:06.000
Go vote! Brent, how you holding up there in the north? Is it snowy? Is it cold? Is it all right?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.240
It's, there's lots of snow and it's always cold.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:14.160
Is it at the point where it's getting pretty old or are you still, can you enjoy it at all?

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.120
You know, I will say this time of year, I really appreciate because it's, it's,

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:23.440
it's longer sunny days. So I actually prefer this part of winter, you know, January and so

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:28.920
is kind of depressive. But man, it's so sunny and there's still snow everywhere and it's just

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:35.880
beautiful. So I actually decided before Linux Unplugged that I would go for a hike afterwards.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.360
So once we hang up here, I'm going for a hike.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:44.840
Nice. Good, good for you. I also have felt like the longer evenings have made a huge difference.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.960
Like I was just saying, I was barbecuing last night for the first time this year, I think.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:51.240
There's something about the sun being out, I sort of think to when it's going to be hot

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.800
in the summer and it suddenly feels very refreshing now.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:58.800
Yeah. Oh, God, it was so nice. It was 50 degrees last night when I was out there barbecuing and

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.920
it was no wind, you know, like the kind of wind where a light, you can, you can, your light doesn't

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:10.000
even, you know, just stand straight up and barbecuing and sun setting. It was so nice.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.040
I was thinking to myself, why the hell am I driving to Denver? This is so nice right now.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:16.520
Wyoming's going to be just miserable.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.680
How many miles does that drive to Denver?

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:22.520
Ah, I think 16.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:24.240
I'm on it. I'm on it.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.320
Thank you. That's the answer.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.640
A lot of gas. A lot of gas. Thankfully, the oil market is crashing right now and my trip

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:35.920
will be slightly cheaper as a result. And I'm paying for it out of pocket too. So I'm very

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:36.960
much watching the gas prices.

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.640
From the studio, 1,334 miles.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:41.920
Do you get snow chains?

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:49.120
I do not. That's what I'm, the number one concern with an underline I have is that we

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.720
will get somewhere that requires chains. Now, last night we did a route sweep. We looked

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.280
at all the webcams. We looked at all the route advisories and everything right now is, does

01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:01.800
not require chains, but obviously that could change any day. And that is a huge thing that

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:07.040
I am concerned about and because we'll have no option but to turn around. And so, ah,

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:10.360
I'm really hoping that doesn't happen, but it just depends on the weather.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.160
You said 1,334?

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160
Yeah.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.600
I think we should round that up to 1,337.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:22.320
And I'm going, yeah, that's right. And I'm going from like sea level to 8,000 feet and

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:25.200
then I'll be going down to like 5,200 feet ultimately.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:28.960
Yeah, 11,000 is your delta in feet. That's crazy.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:34.280
Make sure to keep up on Wyoming 411. I-80 had a huge, oh my God, hundred car accident

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:38.280
last week and was closed both ways. That's the exact kind of shit I don't want to have

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.280
to deal with.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.200
You still got the, uh, the tracker going? The, the rover?

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.280
No, the subscription expired. So I won't have the tracker for this trip. I know. And I went

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.680
to go check it last night and their whole webpage is broken and busted. So I couldn't

01:06:50.680 --> 01:07:10.120
even work.
