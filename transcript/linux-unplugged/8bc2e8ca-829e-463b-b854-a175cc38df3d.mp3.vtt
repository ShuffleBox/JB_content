WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
So, you know, as part of my job for these shows is I stay on top of the news.

00:05.640 --> 00:08.560
And one of the things I found really handy about Google Now is it's getting a pretty

00:08.560 --> 00:11.000
good sense of the news I like to read.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.760
And this article showed up in my Google Now feed with wireless conversions on the Pro

00:15.760 --> 00:16.760
5.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.280
Ubuntu phone levels up.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.280
And I thought to myself, oh, interesting.

00:21.280 --> 00:26.400
I hope they have a video of it because I really want to see that.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.960
I hope that there's something to watch so I can see an action.

00:28.960 --> 00:36.800
So I come down here and I hit play and I think, that sounds familiar.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.800
Sounds like a robot.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.600
Try and connect it to my TV.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.320
Sounds like some sort of AI.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.800
If I knew more people were going to watch this video, I would have tidied my lounge.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.240
Yeah, and maybe add a better mic, I mean, for goodness sake.

00:50.240 --> 00:56.960
So really you're just in your room there, you hit a button on your Ubuntu phone and

00:56.960 --> 01:00.000
this giant Microsoft display lights up.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.360
Now what's with the Microsoft display?

01:01.360 --> 01:02.640
Tell us the story about that.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.480
That's a Miracast dongle.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.360
There's like numerous companies that make Miracast dongles.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.760
And it just happens to be that the first one that we got working was a Microsoft one because

01:11.760 --> 01:16.040
I think that's the first one a developer happened to have nearby and it was cheap.

01:16.040 --> 01:19.480
I think some LG TVs work as well.

01:19.480 --> 01:23.240
So I bought one because he said that one works, so I bought one, plugged it into the TV, went

01:23.240 --> 01:28.920
and got my phone and when I came back there was a Windows logo on my TV.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.820
It's like, you know, we swallowed that pill too when we decided, well, I want a really

01:31.820 --> 01:36.320
good game controller under Linux, so I'll get the Xboxes and even us, the most hardcore

01:36.320 --> 01:39.960
Linux users, eventually buckled down and did it for the most part.

01:39.960 --> 01:44.080
So yeah, it looks pretty good, how's the performance?

01:44.080 --> 01:50.520
So there's a little bit of lag and it's noticeable if you, like on that video it's not very good

01:50.520 --> 01:55.560
because my thumb is jittering across the display, but I did another video where it's a lot smoother

01:55.560 --> 01:59.440
and I pick up a window with a mouse and drag it around and it's a lot easier.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.440
Is that on your channel too?

02:00.440 --> 02:01.880
Yes, the next video, I think.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.860
But does that one have nearly 10,000 views?

02:03.860 --> 02:04.860
That's the big question.

02:04.860 --> 02:05.860
No.

02:05.860 --> 02:06.860
That's all Chris is interested in.

02:06.860 --> 02:10.240
Because it's not got some fat guy standing in front of a TV, that's why.

02:10.240 --> 02:14.720
Okay, it's only got 2,700 views, yeah, okay.

02:14.720 --> 02:18.440
Also the OMG Ubuntu effect helps.

02:18.440 --> 02:23.120
So yeah, you just press a button and it scans your local network for Miracast devices and

02:23.120 --> 02:24.120
it shows them all.

02:24.120 --> 02:29.400
So it'll show your Sony TV or your Sanyo or Samsung or whatever TV, but it might not necessarily

02:29.400 --> 02:30.400
connect to them.

02:30.400 --> 02:38.280
But the cool thing is the log files are captured in Varlog like any standard Linux device and

02:38.280 --> 02:44.120
you can grab those, the software is called Aethercast and you just grab the log from

02:44.120 --> 02:47.560
there and file a bug on Launchpad and they'll work through all the devices to get others

02:47.560 --> 02:48.560
working.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.280
So you asked about performance.

02:51.280 --> 02:57.100
It's a bit laggy, there's a bit of a delay and they're working on improving the encoding

02:57.100 --> 03:02.360
and the performance and there's also some funky stuff that I don't fully understand

03:02.360 --> 03:06.640
about how there's multiple channels that you can send data to the device.

03:06.640 --> 03:10.440
There's like the video stream which shows the display and there's a separate channel

03:10.440 --> 03:11.840
where you can tell it where the cursor is.

03:11.840 --> 03:17.300
So rather than you sending an image of the desktop and an image of the cursor, you can

03:17.300 --> 03:23.400
tell it the X, Y coordinates of the cursor and the dongle paints the cursor faster.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.620
You don't get that perception of lag.

03:25.620 --> 03:29.440
And this is, now do these two devices set up a Wi-Fi network between each other directly

03:29.440 --> 03:31.280
or do they just have to be on the same LAN?

03:31.280 --> 03:32.280
How does that work?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.200
Dude, it's magic.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.720
I have no idea how the hell this works.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.800
I just press a button and this stuff appears.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.600
You can tell the surprise in my voice when it works.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.080
It was the first time I tested it.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.080
Really?

03:43.080 --> 03:47.760
Yeah, I watched the video like halfway through when I look up, I pan the phone up and look

03:47.760 --> 03:52.520
at the screen, I'm like, oh, that worked then, okay then.

03:52.520 --> 03:55.320
I love it when that kind of stuff happens.

03:55.320 --> 04:03.920
And the nice thing is that unlike Chromecast, which is in a lot of things, or Apple's Airplay,

04:03.920 --> 04:08.040
this Miracast, I mean there's a lot of devices out there that have it built in as just sort

04:08.040 --> 04:09.520
of an industry standard, right?

04:09.520 --> 04:14.280
My Sony TV, that TV actually has it built in, but it doesn't work yet.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.160
There's some protocol thing.

04:16.160 --> 04:20.520
Apparently it turns out that Miracast is a standard, but they all implement it differently.

04:20.520 --> 04:22.280
Every single dongle is broken.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.280
Surprise.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.280
Yeah.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.040
That's always how it goes.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.040
You know what?

04:27.040 --> 04:28.680
The Linux community has seen that before.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.840
That is not, we're used to that.

04:30.840 --> 04:31.840
Well, cool.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.840
The good part is our part, the Ethercast part is free software.

04:35.840 --> 04:36.840
It's on Launchpad.

04:36.840 --> 04:37.840
That's awesome.

04:37.840 --> 04:43.760
It's Miracast, so I think it's using some components from some other Miracast tools

04:43.760 --> 04:48.560
that are around, so if people want to get it working on their TV, then that's the code

04:48.560 --> 04:49.560
you need to hack on.

04:49.560 --> 04:52.400
You know, it's funny because a lot of times in discussions with people, when we talked

04:52.400 --> 04:58.300
about convergence, a lot of people, I think Matt was one of them, who was like, call me

04:58.300 --> 04:59.360
when it's wireless.

04:59.360 --> 05:03.960
If I have to sit down and put my phone into a dock, I'm done, and I always thought, whatever.

05:03.960 --> 05:04.960
I want a dock.

05:04.960 --> 05:05.960
I want a hardwired connection.

05:05.960 --> 05:06.960
Sounds so great.

05:06.960 --> 05:11.040
But there is something to the being able to just project your screen up onto a larger

05:11.040 --> 05:13.360
screen on almost anywhere you go.

05:13.360 --> 05:17.760
If this took off, you could just see an organization equipping their conference rooms with those

05:17.760 --> 05:21.240
TVs that they know, or those dongles that they know are going to work with something

05:21.240 --> 05:22.240
like this.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.200
And now you have the ability to present in front of everybody immediately by sending

05:25.200 --> 05:26.200
your screen up there.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.200
Oh, that sounds great.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.200
Yeah.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.000
In fact, the first time I saw this, the first time I was at a sprint in Prague a few weeks

05:31.000 --> 05:35.880
ago, and the first time I saw it was one of the Unity 8 developers did a demo.

05:35.880 --> 05:39.360
We do like demos at our internal sprint, so we get everyone up to speed with what's going

05:39.360 --> 05:41.320
on elsewhere in the company.

05:41.320 --> 05:46.920
And he stood up and connected his phone, I say connected, you know, in the wireless way,

05:46.920 --> 05:49.700
connected it to this dongle, which was connected to a projector.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.640
So we're all watching this on a projector.

05:51.640 --> 05:56.980
And we're thinking, wow, you could actually give a presentation directly from your device

05:56.980 --> 05:59.480
because the phone becomes your mouse and keyboard.

05:59.480 --> 06:05.360
If you click on a field, which is a an input field, the onscreen keyboard pops up on the

06:05.360 --> 06:06.360
phone.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.120
So you can just use the phone as a mouse and a keyboard.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.840
It's not the easiest thing to do.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.760
But if you wanted to give a presentation, you totally could do that.

06:12.760 --> 06:13.760
Oh, yeah.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.760
Oh, sure.

06:14.760 --> 06:15.760
I've done that with some apps.

06:15.760 --> 06:16.760
And you know, I know they think about it.

06:16.760 --> 06:23.600
I have seen offices that have Apple TVs and have a Chromecast on hooked up to their devices.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.780
But in the case of the Apple TV, that's a huge expense because the devices that are

06:27.780 --> 06:32.000
capable of communicating with that have a massive premium, which is not always optimal

06:32.000 --> 06:37.440
in the business place, or especially in the education market, which is a massive field

06:37.440 --> 06:40.000
for this, a massive field for this.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.640
And the Chromecast, the downside to that, the price is right.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.280
And the availability is high.

06:45.280 --> 06:50.280
But the dependency on a third-party service makes it unreliable and makes it problematic

06:50.280 --> 06:54.160
for large institutions behind multi-level firewalls and things like that.

06:54.160 --> 06:59.760
So something that is over your local Wi-Fi network, a industry standard to some degree,

06:59.760 --> 07:03.920
and built into potential mobile devices, there is a lot of room for that still.

07:03.920 --> 07:04.920
That's really cool.

07:04.920 --> 07:05.920
I'm excited.

07:05.920 --> 07:06.920
Check.

07:06.920 --> 07:25.400
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 149 for June 14, 2016.

07:25.400 --> 07:31.840
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is reporting on the front lines

07:31.840 --> 07:34.700
of the Linux packaging cold war.

07:34.700 --> 07:35.700
My name is Chris.

07:35.700 --> 07:36.700
My name is Wes.

07:36.700 --> 07:37.700
Do you like that?

07:37.700 --> 07:38.700
Oh, I like it a lot.

07:38.700 --> 07:39.700
You know what I'm referring to.

07:39.700 --> 07:40.700
I certainly do.

07:40.700 --> 07:41.700
We're going to get into it.

07:41.700 --> 07:42.700
I mean, it's unbelievable.

07:42.700 --> 07:43.700
As if we had planned it.

07:43.700 --> 07:49.760
Almost every week there is some big development in universal Linux packaging.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.200
You know, that one installer for all distros.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.400
Maybe someday we'll even be able to use them.

07:54.400 --> 07:59.800
So Canonical is here this week with a huge bombshell announcement in this category.

07:59.800 --> 08:00.920
So we're going to talk about that.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.400
We're going to even try it right here on the show.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.120
We've been trying it and give you our early hands-on.

08:05.120 --> 08:10.480
Speaking of early hands-on, elementary OS has their new Loki beta out based on Ubuntu

08:10.480 --> 08:13.840
16.04 and full of all of their new shiny.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.280
There's also a few hints of things they may have coming.

08:16.280 --> 08:17.280
We'll tell you all about that.

08:17.280 --> 08:21.280
Our early impressions, because it is just a beta, so bear that in mind.

08:21.280 --> 08:26.080
And then we have a bunch of epic open source project updates.

08:26.080 --> 08:29.920
Stories that broke just in the last couple of days.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.520
Extremely relevant to our interest.

08:31.520 --> 08:32.520
So guess what?

08:32.520 --> 08:34.360
We're going to cover them right here on the show.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.680
We're going to do that right here.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.240
The rumors of my vacation were false.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.240
That's coming later.

08:40.240 --> 08:41.960
I'm hanging in there for a few more weeks.

08:41.960 --> 08:42.960
Are you strong?

08:42.960 --> 08:47.560
Thinking back, thinking back, if I could have planned it, I would have left town like a

08:47.560 --> 08:48.760
honeymoon after a wedding.

08:48.760 --> 08:52.880
As soon as I wrapped up Lass's 10th anniversary, I would have left town, because boy could

08:52.880 --> 08:53.880
I use it.

08:53.880 --> 08:54.880
But I'll tell you what.

08:54.880 --> 08:55.960
The fight goes on.

08:55.960 --> 09:00.200
We continue to be on the front lines, just like our virtual lug.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.200
Let's bring them in now.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.760
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

09:02.760 --> 09:03.760
Hey guys.

09:03.760 --> 09:04.760
Hello.

09:04.760 --> 09:05.760
Hello.

09:05.760 --> 09:06.760
Hello.

09:06.760 --> 09:07.760
Hello.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.120
So I guess I made a comment last week, because Wimpy messaged me and was like, so are you

09:10.120 --> 09:11.120
on vacation?

09:11.120 --> 09:12.120
I'm like, no.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.120
I need a vacation.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.520
But no, I am not on vacation.

09:15.520 --> 09:19.040
So if you were surprised that I'm here this week, I apologize for misstating.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.160
Well, that's always a good surprise.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.160
Yeah.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.160
Thanks, Wes.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.160
Thanks.

09:24.160 --> 09:28.200
But I will be going on vacation the first week of July.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.520
So Mr. Colonel will probably be sitting down with you on the show.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.520
Oh.

09:32.520 --> 09:33.520
Yeah.

09:33.520 --> 09:37.920
And of course, it means I'll probably miss two weeks of Lass, too.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.840
So we'll probably have a guest hosting there.

09:39.840 --> 09:40.840
Hint, hint.

09:40.840 --> 09:41.840
You may already know him.

09:41.840 --> 09:42.840
Hmm.

09:42.840 --> 09:43.840
Hmm.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.840
Hmm.

09:44.840 --> 09:48.600
So before we're here to talk about today, though, today we have some really big news.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.640
We have what you might even say is breaking news.

09:50.640 --> 09:54.760
I should break it out just for the special event, some CNN breaking news.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.760
This is CNN breaking news.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.760
Big stories.

09:58.760 --> 10:01.160
Two big stories, really, to start the show off with.

10:01.160 --> 10:05.880
Number one is that Nextcloud actually has some code shipping.

10:05.880 --> 10:10.360
Nextcloud 9 is available, and enterprise functionality is going open source, well ahead of the July

10:10.360 --> 10:15.600
promise, I guess, of the early July promise, I guess.

10:15.600 --> 10:19.000
Nextcloud makes available Nextcloud version 9.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.600
They're also releasing all enterprise functionality as open source, building on top of the open

10:22.600 --> 10:25.420
source own cloud core and adding functionality and fixes.

10:25.420 --> 10:28.400
This release provides a solid base for users to migrate to.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.400
Hmm.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.400
What do you think, Wes?

10:30.400 --> 10:33.880
Yeah, they've got an Android app here they can get for free, too.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.720
Are you surprised at how fast this came?

10:35.720 --> 10:36.720
That is kind of fast.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.760
I mean, just from what they were saying before, they didn't really hint at... I expected

10:40.760 --> 10:44.600
it in a month or two, maybe, but hey, maybe I'm going to have to spin this up and just

10:44.600 --> 10:45.600
play with it.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.200
I'm sure there's not that much that's different, right, than the own cloud on YouTube, but

10:48.200 --> 10:51.800
I'd be curious to see how it feels.

10:51.800 --> 10:58.280
This release really has got to be about this new enterprise functionality, the new branding,

10:58.280 --> 11:01.680
and I think it's got to be about momentum, too.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.680
Right.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.520
They need to start off their new project and really have a good, solid release and have

11:06.520 --> 11:07.680
a platform they're built on.

11:07.680 --> 11:08.680
What's your read on it, Daredevil?

11:08.680 --> 11:13.760
Basically, I think it's a publicity stunt and smart because you just had a bad impact

11:13.760 --> 11:14.760
new.

11:14.760 --> 11:19.280
You have to bring new, fast impact news while still people are paying attention to what's

11:19.280 --> 11:21.080
going on with you.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.080
So it is sort of a building on the momentum thing and a smart one.

11:24.080 --> 11:25.440
It shows a good instinct.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.600
It shows that they got some savvy behind them.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.600
We want that.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.920
This next cloud thing's going to work out.

11:30.920 --> 11:31.920
That's what I think.

11:31.920 --> 11:32.920
I mean, look at them.

11:32.920 --> 11:33.920
I'm tempted to go try it.

11:33.920 --> 11:34.920
Is that a prediction?

11:34.920 --> 11:35.920
I'm tempted.

11:35.920 --> 11:36.920
I mean …

11:36.920 --> 11:37.920
Oh, yeah.

11:37.920 --> 11:38.920
Maybe we should get one up and running.

11:38.920 --> 11:44.240
I just sort of got my head wrapped around the last release of OnCloud, so it seems almost

11:44.240 --> 11:49.880
too soon to go to something else, but probably the sooner you switch, the better.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.200
Traditionally though, the sooner you upgrade, probably the better.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.920
I guess you don't want to go too many releases, I mean.

11:54.920 --> 11:55.920
Right.

11:55.920 --> 11:56.920
Probably true.

11:56.920 --> 11:57.920
Get it over with.

11:57.920 --> 11:58.920
Exactly.

11:58.920 --> 11:59.920
All right.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.920
Anybody else have thoughts on the new next cloud release before we move right along?

12:02.920 --> 12:04.720
Got a couple other big stories.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.920
I thought this one was interesting, just a sort of rebuttal to some discussion that was

12:08.920 --> 12:12.760
out there regarding the slowdown of Steam machines.

12:12.760 --> 12:13.760
Wait.

12:13.760 --> 12:14.760
There's still Steam machines?

12:14.760 --> 12:15.760
Slowdown.

12:15.760 --> 12:16.760
I thought those were dead, Chris.

12:16.760 --> 12:17.760
No.

12:17.760 --> 12:18.760
No.

12:18.760 --> 12:21.360
They're still around, and in fact, that company, Valve, has got a good announcement, along

12:21.360 --> 12:22.360
with Dell.

12:22.360 --> 12:25.640
They've just pumped out a couple of more of these suckers, a couple of more of these.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.040
They've upgraded them to Skylake.

12:27.040 --> 12:32.760
These SOBs now got Skylake in them with DDR4 memory and some more NVIDIA GPUs.

12:32.760 --> 12:39.040
It looks like they're sort of going at this with a pretty reasonable expectation.

12:39.040 --> 12:42.400
This is, at least, I'm just reading the words from Chris Suffen, I think.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.760
He's the senior marketing manager at Alienware.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.760
This is a direct quote.

12:45.760 --> 12:51.280
He said, we expect that the SteamOS catalog is going to strengthen at the end of the year.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.280
What do you think, Wesley?

12:52.280 --> 12:53.280
He knows stuff, doesn't he?

12:53.280 --> 12:54.280
It sounds like he does.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.400
What do you think he knows?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.880
I'm not sure, but I'm really curious.

12:56.880 --> 13:00.880
I think I have a hint, because this is a further comment.

13:00.880 --> 13:06.800
He says, Vulkan will speed up transition for SteamOS to AAA content.

13:06.800 --> 13:10.520
So maybe he thinks a lot of big games are going to be shipping with Vulkan support at

13:10.520 --> 13:11.520
the end of the year.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.520
That would be cool.

13:12.520 --> 13:15.880
So is $8.99 the price point for you?

13:15.880 --> 13:18.880
$7.49 is the low price for an i5.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.800
Do you ever go for the low price?

13:21.800 --> 13:27.360
GTX 960, 8 gigs of RAM.

13:27.360 --> 13:33.280
You know, actually, Wes, so you're going to get two cores with an i5, and you're going

13:33.280 --> 13:36.200
to get four cores with an i7, in reality.

13:36.200 --> 13:41.480
They're both shipping with a GTX 960 GPU, both shipping with 8 gigabytes of RAM, both

13:41.480 --> 13:46.280
shipping with 802.11 AC Wi-Fi, and I hope Ethernet.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.320
One difference, though, is 500 gig hard drive in the cheaper one, one terabyte hard drive

13:49.320 --> 13:50.320
in the bigger one.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.160
But to be honest with you, I'm more likely to crack that thing open and put a SSD.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.160
I assume it wouldn't be too hard to just replace that.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.160
If I could.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.920
I mean, part of me thinks, how great are these games under Linux if they're optimized for

13:59.920 --> 14:01.020
more than two cores?

14:01.020 --> 14:02.020
Is that a thing?

14:02.020 --> 14:05.560
I mean, I have seen that it is a thing, but is it that common of a thing that it's worth

14:05.560 --> 14:09.240
going from $750 to $900?

14:09.240 --> 14:10.240
Maybe not.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.720
Especially if I'm not really interested in a spinning-rest terabyte hard drive?

14:12.720 --> 14:15.000
And you're going to do aftermarket modifications anyway.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.320
But what do you think of that price, $7.49 for the entry?

14:17.320 --> 14:22.240
A little steep, but if you really don't want to assemble something yourself, you want to

14:22.240 --> 14:26.680
just have a dedicated appliance and you're in on your Steam library and you don't have

14:26.680 --> 14:30.960
a lot of Windows-only games or the games you do like maybe will be here in the end of the

14:30.960 --> 14:31.960
year, maybe it would work.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.840
I don't know if the i5 is quad-core.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.840
Is it?

14:35.840 --> 14:37.800
I thought the i5 was dual-core with hyper-threading.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.800
No, it's quad.

14:39.800 --> 14:43.080
Well, then I definitely would just get the i5, I think.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.760
So what's the i7?

14:44.760 --> 14:45.760
Is it six-core?

14:45.760 --> 14:46.760
It's quad with hyper-threading.

14:46.760 --> 14:47.760
Oh, OK.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.480
Yeah, I don't really think that's worth it, then.

14:50.480 --> 14:55.200
So Wimpy, what do you think, you've got the Skylake, or not Skylake, the Skull Canyon,

14:55.200 --> 14:56.200
is that what it is?

14:56.200 --> 14:59.880
The really fancy, like more gamer edition, high-end NUC?

14:59.880 --> 15:00.880
I'm drooling, Wimpy.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.360
What are your thoughts?

15:03.360 --> 15:06.960
It's exceeded expectations, I'm suitably impressed.

15:06.960 --> 15:17.520
So it's got the Skylake i7-6770HQ, so that's a quad-core eight-thread CPU.

15:17.520 --> 15:23.320
And it's got the Iris Pro 540, which I think is the top model at the moment.

15:23.320 --> 15:28.720
And my last NUC, which I got in November last year, was the NUC that was the best at the

15:28.720 --> 15:31.360
time, so it's the second best.

15:31.360 --> 15:35.720
And this significantly outperforms it, just using the Iris Pro.

15:35.720 --> 15:42.260
So the game that I'm most playing is Grid Autosport, and by comparison, that on the

15:42.260 --> 15:51.720
old NUC would pump out around 35 frames per second average on low settings at 720p.

15:51.720 --> 15:59.880
This new box can do 1080p medium graphics, about 55 frames per second peaks at 75 frames

15:59.880 --> 16:03.560
per second, so significantly better.

16:03.560 --> 16:10.260
But the reason I've got it, the project for the future, is it's got Thunderbolt, and I

16:10.260 --> 16:16.400
want to experiment with an external GPU connected over Thunderbolt later in the year.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.000
I would be very curious to see how that goes.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.320
Honestly if that worked, I would be in almost instantaneously.

16:21.320 --> 16:28.600
Because see, for example, I have not had as much success with Iris gaming.

16:28.600 --> 16:32.540
I have played some games, but then there's like a new Formula One racing game that's

16:32.540 --> 16:39.840
come out, AAA racing game, and it's punishing, even on the highest end Nvidia GPU, it's punishing.

16:39.840 --> 16:45.440
So there's those edge cases from time to time where you feel limited by the Intel graphics,

16:45.440 --> 16:49.840
but there's such edge cases that if I could plug in an external GPU case and then have

16:49.840 --> 16:53.400
the capability of playing that game when I need it, but then have a quiet, I assume it's

16:53.400 --> 16:54.400
really quiet, right?

16:54.400 --> 16:55.400
Yeah, it's silent.

16:55.400 --> 16:59.680
Yeah, see, I'm all about that.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.160
Yeah, that modular, like, okay, boom.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.160
I like this NUC.

17:03.160 --> 17:11.360
It's tiny, but I've got 32 gigs of RAM in it, and it's DDR4, and I've got 128 gig M.2

17:11.360 --> 17:18.480
SSD for the OS, and one 1 terabyte M.2 SSD for the home partition.

17:18.480 --> 17:28.040
So it has HDMI, DisplayPort Mini, USB-C, USB 3.0, Ethernet, and that's it.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.600
Oh, and there's a couple of front USB ports.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.400
RAM, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, and a charging USB and Thunderbolt.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.400
That's really everything you need, though.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.400
Yeah, definitely.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.180
Yeah, and the thing's tiny.

17:38.180 --> 17:42.020
So if you're familiar with the old form factor NUC, it's a different size.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.880
So if you think of the thinnest NUCs, it's like two of those side by side, but a bit

17:45.880 --> 17:49.160
thinner, and it's got a nifty case.

17:49.160 --> 17:54.400
So it goes for 650 US greenbacks on Newegg.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.400
See that, I'm sold on.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.200
You think that's a pretty good price?

17:57.200 --> 17:58.200
That's not bad, right?

17:58.200 --> 18:03.640
Actually, yeah, I suppose so, because it comes with the i7 processor, but I don't think it

18:03.640 --> 18:04.640
comes with RAM.

18:04.640 --> 18:05.640
Oh, right.

18:05.640 --> 18:06.640
Yeah, that's a fair percentage.

18:06.640 --> 18:12.880
So you'd have to get RAM and maybe a disk, but I actually, if the performance is there,

18:12.880 --> 18:17.480
I think it's worth it to have, these days, especially in here, like that machine right

18:17.480 --> 18:19.920
there, I would love to have it be silent.

18:19.920 --> 18:20.920
So interesting, Wimpy.

18:20.920 --> 18:25.260
I will, oh, look at that.

18:25.260 --> 18:27.680
I will say, I'm pretty tempted by one of these.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.840
Maybe not at the moment, because I just don't really need one, but down the road.

18:30.840 --> 18:31.840
Down the road, yeah.

18:31.840 --> 18:32.840
Yeah.

18:32.840 --> 18:33.840
I hope they keep making these.

18:33.840 --> 18:34.840
Skull Canyon.

18:34.840 --> 18:38.200
Yeah, it's a nice device, I'm very impressed.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.400
And if the external GPU worked, it would also make a pretty good...

18:41.400 --> 18:45.040
Yeah, and the only thing about the external GPU, of course, is that you're looking at

18:45.040 --> 18:48.440
like five gigabits per second over the Thunderbolt interface.

18:48.440 --> 18:55.200
So when you compare that to PCI Express, it's a lot slower, so it's no good hooking up a

18:55.200 --> 19:01.520
supremely powerful GPU, because it won't be able to saturate the bus.

19:01.520 --> 19:07.420
So I need to do some sums there to figure out what GPU is sensible.

19:07.420 --> 19:10.680
The chat room points out, too, that it's a mobile i7.

19:10.680 --> 19:18.280
But really, Skylake, and really even past generation processors, the mobile processors,

19:18.280 --> 19:20.040
just incredible.

19:20.040 --> 19:24.400
I do notice, on the couple of desktops that we built for Linux Fest, there are desktop

19:24.400 --> 19:28.680
machines that we're using for different functions that have six core processors.

19:28.680 --> 19:29.920
That's the new sweet spot.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.400
Six cores is so the sweet spot now.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.440
I love it.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.640
So I'm ready for mobile processors to get that.

19:35.640 --> 19:36.900
Yeah, absolutely.

19:36.900 --> 19:39.560
So the Intel NUC Skull Canyon.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.960
I was thinking that was a good one.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.640
Have you tried any Thunderbolt device, Wimpy?

19:43.640 --> 19:45.400
Not yet, no.

19:45.400 --> 19:50.480
I haven't got any Thunderbolt devices to plug into it, and I thought I'd wait for the 4.7

19:50.480 --> 19:55.720
kernel to get shipped stable before I start experimenting with that.

19:55.720 --> 19:59.920
Because I believe that's the version that's going to have all of the new Thunderbolt source

19:59.920 --> 20:00.920
in it.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.680
Oh, man.

20:02.680 --> 20:08.120
So I'm going to turn off a couple of filters here on my mic just for a second so you guys

20:08.120 --> 20:09.120
can hear.

20:09.120 --> 20:14.760
I don't know if you can hear, but it probably sounds like rushing air.

20:14.760 --> 20:15.760
Do you hear that?

20:15.760 --> 20:17.840
Can you hear that in the background?

20:17.840 --> 20:20.680
It is storming like crazy outside right now.

20:20.680 --> 20:24.480
And I have some filters on my – here, I just tried to cut some of it out with my mic.

20:24.480 --> 20:32.200
But it is – and if it's following what I believe to be the case, what's that – is

20:32.200 --> 20:33.320
it Forecastio?

20:33.320 --> 20:42.320
What is that website – what's that website that like Dark Cloud pulls – yeah, Forecast.io.

20:42.320 --> 20:47.040
So if I go look at our current location, I think we are about to have like a huge thunderstorm

20:47.040 --> 20:48.040
hit.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.040
So it's –

20:49.040 --> 20:50.040
Well, let's hope we keep power, everyone.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.040
Yeah.

20:51.040 --> 20:55.800
It could be – the show could be getting disrupted here in a moment because, you know, I feel

20:55.800 --> 20:59.040
like these days, honestly, I feel like I live in a freaking rainforest.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.040
I don't know what's up.

21:00.040 --> 21:01.040
I don't anymore.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.200
I just feel like – I feel like I live where it's constantly storming and rain forest.

21:03.200 --> 21:06.760
So anyways, if you hear loud banging in the background or if we suddenly go away on the

21:06.760 --> 21:09.960
live stream, it's because the storming is picking up.

21:09.960 --> 21:10.960
It is the great flood.

21:10.960 --> 21:11.960
Yeah.

21:11.960 --> 21:12.960
It's raining like crazy.

21:12.960 --> 21:13.960
Can you see out the window?

21:13.960 --> 21:14.960
Oh, yeah.

21:14.960 --> 21:15.960
Absolutely.

21:15.960 --> 21:16.960
Can you see out there right now?

21:16.960 --> 21:17.960
Yeah.

21:17.960 --> 21:18.960
All right.

21:18.960 --> 21:19.960
So we're going to move on.

21:19.960 --> 21:24.760
I want to talk about – well, a couple of things that came out of Apple's WWDC keynote

21:24.760 --> 21:29.000
that are worth mentioning for the open source community.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.560
I always feel weird about this after it happens because WWDC comes around, and then it's

21:33.560 --> 21:36.360
like this big awkward time for us Linux users.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.360
Exactly.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.360
Very well said.

21:38.360 --> 21:39.360
I feel the same way.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.360
Because sometimes some cool stuff is announced.

21:40.360 --> 21:41.360
You're like –

21:41.360 --> 21:43.160
But you don't want to feel that excited about it, but you're kind of interested, and you're

21:43.160 --> 21:44.160
still –

21:44.160 --> 21:46.920
So then sometimes you're like motivated to like – yeah, like bash it.

21:46.920 --> 21:49.320
Because you want to like distance yourself from it.

21:49.320 --> 21:50.320
Right.

21:50.320 --> 21:55.160
Is that why you've been Googling butterFS so much, Chris?

21:55.160 --> 21:56.160
Exactly.

21:56.160 --> 22:00.440
So there's just a couple of things I wanted to mention that – well, one is a feature

22:00.440 --> 22:02.800
that was announced at WWDC that we can already do on Linux.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.880
I'll tell you about that.

22:03.880 --> 22:11.440
And the other – I bet you can guess what this one is – is a solid response to a rather

22:11.440 --> 22:12.760
infamous rant of mine.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.600
But first, I'm going to tell you about our friends over at DigitalOcean.

22:15.600 --> 22:20.720
Boy, speaking of storage, DigitalOcean has their block storage beta rolling out.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.720
Noah got in on it.

22:21.720 --> 22:22.720
Oh, did he?

22:22.720 --> 22:23.720
Yeah, I'm not in on it.

22:23.720 --> 22:24.720
I'm not yet either.

22:24.720 --> 22:25.720
Oh, you got to tell me when you get in.

22:25.720 --> 22:30.020
So DigitalOcean is a really easy, straightforward cloud hosting provider.

22:30.020 --> 22:34.600
You want to go spin up a Linux rig that's a bare bones Linux rig, or one that's got

22:34.600 --> 22:37.400
the entire application stack for whatever you might need.

22:37.400 --> 22:40.880
Say you want to go experiment with Nextcloud, or say you want to try something like Sync

22:40.880 --> 22:41.880
thing or BitTorrent Sync.

22:41.880 --> 22:42.880
That's a great idea.

22:42.880 --> 22:43.880
Yeah.

22:43.880 --> 22:44.880
It's perfect for that.

22:44.880 --> 22:50.000
But the price point starting at $5 a month, the price is easy to swallow, so you could

22:50.000 --> 22:51.760
just experiment and test.

22:51.760 --> 22:56.160
But then if you want to go into production, well, these systems are all backed by SSDs.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.040
They have data centers all over the world.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.760
They have tier one bandwidth.

22:59.760 --> 23:04.400
They have 40 gigabit E connectors into the hypervisor, like the NUCs – or the NUCs

23:04.400 --> 23:07.000
– the NICs – the NUCs.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.560
Not the same thing.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.560
Network interface cards.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.400
40 gigabit E network interface cards.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.120
I love that.

23:13.120 --> 23:18.040
For $5 a month, you get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte

23:18.040 --> 23:19.040
of transfer.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.640
And then they have the best interface to manage it on top of that.

23:21.640 --> 23:27.600
A really slick, easy-to-use UI that's simple for beginners, but powerful enough for actual

23:27.600 --> 23:28.600
experts.

23:28.600 --> 23:32.920
That's like one of those unicorns that never actually seems to happen.

23:32.920 --> 23:33.920
Whoa!

23:33.920 --> 23:34.920
Lightning strike!

23:34.920 --> 23:35.920
Lightning!

23:35.920 --> 23:36.920
Digital ocean.

23:36.920 --> 23:37.920
There we go.

23:37.920 --> 23:38.920
Yeah.

23:38.920 --> 23:39.920
Digital ocean.

23:39.920 --> 23:40.920
Nailed it.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.040
See, that's the cloud right there, responding to how awesome digital ocean is.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.040
They really are awesome.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.760
That's the power of the digital ocean cloud.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.800
Just promise me something.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.800
Come here, close.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.400
You gotta do me a solid, okay?

23:52.400 --> 23:54.720
You gotta use that promo code, DOUNPLUGGED.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.640
That way I can pay for that lightning strike hole in the ceiling.

23:57.640 --> 23:58.640
DOUNPLUGGED.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.200
One word lowercase, $10 credit.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.200
You got that?

24:02.200 --> 24:03.200
Thank you.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.200
That's all I ask for.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.200
Chris needs you, folks.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.200
DigitalOcean.com.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.200
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

24:07.200 --> 24:11.720
Thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

24:11.720 --> 24:16.720
That was funny, man, because I saw that lightning strike out of the corner of my eye, because

24:16.720 --> 24:19.160
it's just right out of the window there.

24:19.160 --> 24:22.680
So anyways, by the way, one other thing about DigitalOcean.

24:22.680 --> 24:27.280
For those of you that are kernel Linux crazy, they do have a how to provision and manage

24:27.280 --> 24:31.000
Docker with CentOS.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
It's possible.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
It's possible over at DigitalOcean.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
But why?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Go check it out.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
All right.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
So I teased it just really quickly.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.240
Did you guys, anybody in the Mumba room have a guess on what the news out of WWDC is that

24:41.240 --> 24:44.560
I actually am kind of happy about?

24:44.560 --> 24:45.560
Anybody have a guess?

24:45.560 --> 24:46.560
Mumba room.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.560
New file format system?

24:47.560 --> 24:48.560
Yeah.

24:48.560 --> 24:49.560
You got it.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.560
The new APFS.

24:50.560 --> 24:58.200
Apple's new file system, copy on write metadata, native file encryption, instant cloning, snapshots.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.800
Don't call it ZFS.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.120
It's not ZFS.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.120
Don't call it ButterFS.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.560
Although, you know what?

25:04.560 --> 25:08.160
It's probably very closely more, it's probably more like ButterFS than ZFS.

25:08.160 --> 25:09.160
It probably is.

25:09.160 --> 25:12.600
Are they saying that it's not going to run well?

25:12.600 --> 25:13.600
Bump bump.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.600
Oh.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.600
Bump bump.

25:15.600 --> 25:16.600
A couple of interesting things about this.

25:16.600 --> 25:23.280
It is, they say, I don't know exactly what this means, but they say it is a 64-bit in

25:23.280 --> 25:24.600
node numbering support system.

25:24.600 --> 25:30.760
It has been designed specifically for SSDs and flash storage, not for spinning disk.

25:30.760 --> 25:31.760
That's the part.

25:31.760 --> 25:32.760
I don't quite know what they mean.

25:32.760 --> 25:37.680
Perhaps this is a file system that presumes it will not be using the SATA interface to

25:37.680 --> 25:38.680
talk to it.

25:38.680 --> 25:39.680
Oh, wouldn't that be interesting?

25:39.680 --> 25:40.680
Yeah.

25:40.680 --> 25:42.400
Perhaps it'll just talk directly to the memory chips.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.840
That's a possibility.

25:45.840 --> 25:51.120
It also will not be available for a while, so it's not like it's rolling out anytime

25:51.120 --> 25:56.400
soon, but here's the interesting tidbit for the open source community.

25:56.400 --> 26:00.720
I normally wouldn't have actually even worth, I wouldn't have mentioned this in the past,

26:00.720 --> 26:07.800
but since they actually delivered on Swift, in their documentation right now, they say,

26:07.800 --> 26:11.600
just like they kind of promised in the past for other things, a developer preview of Apple's

26:11.600 --> 26:17.960
file system was included in OS 10, or now it's supposed to call it Mac OS 10.12, it's

26:17.960 --> 26:20.320
their own documentation, Wes.

26:20.320 --> 26:26.320
Apple plans to document and publish APFS volume format when the Apple file system is released

26:26.320 --> 26:28.160
in 27.

26:28.160 --> 26:34.240
Now, they say an open source implementation is not available at this time, but when they

26:34.240 --> 26:39.240
publish it in 2017, they plan to open source it.

26:39.240 --> 26:40.240
Oh, neat.

26:40.240 --> 26:45.680
Now, the question is, will it be something that already works with Linux, does it be

26:45.680 --> 26:50.920
immediately useful, or something that just works on Mac OS X and does pretty much useless?

26:50.920 --> 26:55.200
Yeah, well, probably the best case scenario will be you'll eventually be able to load

26:55.200 --> 27:00.440
APFS support, like you can load HFS or NTFS support, right, because you know they're not

27:00.440 --> 27:01.440
going to GPL it.

27:01.440 --> 27:04.960
Yeah, the best it'll be is a Fuse module.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.080
Yeah, exactly.

27:06.080 --> 27:09.800
And that, I guess, will at least make compatibility a little easier for us Linux users that have

27:09.800 --> 27:13.800
to interact with Mac users that somehow mistakenly formatted like a thumb drive or something

27:13.800 --> 27:14.800
with this.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.520
I mean, they can't GPL it.

27:16.520 --> 27:19.600
It will pretty much make them make GPL the whole kernel.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.520
Yeah, so you know that's not going to happen, but the fact that they are going to open source

27:22.520 --> 27:26.960
is at least notable, and I believe they'll actually do it.

27:26.960 --> 27:27.960
You don't think so?

27:27.960 --> 27:28.960
What?

27:28.960 --> 27:29.960
What?

27:29.960 --> 27:30.960
What?

27:30.960 --> 27:34.800
They said when they first announced FaceTime that they were going to open source, and they

27:34.800 --> 27:37.840
never did because they got slapped with a lawsuit.

27:37.840 --> 27:41.960
And so it is entirely possible that someone will slap them with a patent claim and say

27:41.960 --> 27:45.600
that we own some part of that file system, you can't open source it, and then that shuts

27:45.600 --> 27:46.600
that down.

27:46.600 --> 27:49.840
So they've made all this big pronouncement, but they don't actually technically have to

27:49.840 --> 27:52.080
do it if someone else comes along and tells them not to.

27:52.080 --> 27:57.640
I bet the case with this though is they've been working on this for quite a few years.

27:57.640 --> 28:03.240
I'm betting that they have been owning a lot of the IP of this as they've gone along because

28:03.240 --> 28:08.800
their intention is for this to run from everything from the watch to the desktop and everything

28:08.800 --> 28:09.800
in between.

28:09.800 --> 28:13.960
So they're probably crossing their eyes and crossing the teeth.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.520
No, you had it right first time.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.520
Probably did.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.520
I find it interesting.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.520
Think different, Chris.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.920
They're doing atomic file transactions.

28:22.920 --> 28:24.880
They talk about snapshots and rollbacks.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.120
These are all things I like.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.120
Trim support.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.120
So anyways.

28:29.120 --> 28:34.880
I wonder how long until they think it's production ready, quote, unquote.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.760
We can't get much worse than HFS, so they don't have a high bar.

28:37.760 --> 28:38.760
That's a fair point.

28:38.760 --> 28:39.760
Yeah.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.840
Is there any indication how long this has been incubating for?

28:42.840 --> 28:43.840
I don't know.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.840
I think some people speculate.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.840
The number I've heard kicked around is seven years.

28:47.840 --> 28:48.840
Wow.

28:48.840 --> 28:54.640
No, it has to be less just because I've been actually monitoring their hiring job boards

28:54.640 --> 29:00.480
and they've been last three years hiring extensively kernel developers, which I am assuming some

29:00.480 --> 29:02.560
of them will be for file system stuff.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.720
So it's three years tops that I will claim.

29:04.720 --> 29:05.720
Yeah.

29:05.720 --> 29:08.380
I guess we might know if they open source it because in the case of Swift, when they

29:08.380 --> 29:12.120
open source Swift, they include the entire commit log.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.120
So we might know.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.120
That's a good point.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.120
That'd be interesting.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.120
Yeah.

29:16.120 --> 29:19.040
Oh, here comes more thunder.

29:19.040 --> 29:24.440
So the other feature, I live streamed the keynote because I figure a lot of people that

29:24.440 --> 29:27.000
listen to Jupyter broadcasting don't have Macs.

29:27.000 --> 29:32.080
They have Linux rigs and the only official stream from Apple, it requires that you use

29:32.080 --> 29:33.080
Safari.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.080
Oh, really?

29:34.080 --> 29:35.080
Yeah.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.080
So lame.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.720
But always somebody posts like an alternative RTMP stream somewhere.

29:38.720 --> 29:42.640
So what I do is I always try to rebroadcast that so that people can just go to the JB live

29:42.640 --> 29:46.440
page on whatever device they want because we're available on the TV, we're available

29:46.440 --> 29:48.040
on their mobile, we're available on their web.

29:48.040 --> 29:51.880
So I figure just make it easy for our audience that would just want to watch it.

29:51.880 --> 29:52.880
Totally.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.720
And so I do commentary along with the chat room and stuff.

29:55.720 --> 29:59.720
And one of the things that everybody in the chat room seemed to universally love was this

29:59.720 --> 30:05.920
new picture in picture feature of Mac OS X or whatever, Mac OS Sierra.

30:05.920 --> 30:06.920
Did you see this?

30:06.920 --> 30:10.140
Where any HTML5 video could be popped out and then you could drag it and it could stay

30:10.140 --> 30:13.560
persistent on top of all applications across all desktops.

30:13.560 --> 30:18.680
And fear not, that feature is already available in Linux via MPV.

30:18.680 --> 30:19.680
Nice.

30:19.680 --> 30:24.760
Mr. InnoGoGo made a link in the Linux Action Show subreddit where he just gives you the

30:24.760 --> 30:28.360
command that you do in MPV and it can pop up into a little picture in picture window

30:28.360 --> 30:29.800
like that and you can move it around.

30:29.800 --> 30:33.920
He even shows how you can do it on Windows if you were so inclined.

30:33.920 --> 30:38.560
I was going to say, one of the things we've got, I mean, window managers, man, we should

30:38.560 --> 30:39.560
be able to get that down.

30:39.560 --> 30:40.560
Right?

30:40.560 --> 30:41.560
Yeah.

30:41.560 --> 30:42.560
Yeah.

30:42.560 --> 30:43.560
So that was like the one feature.

30:43.560 --> 30:44.560
I was like, hmm, that's okay.

30:44.560 --> 30:45.560
It's okay.

30:45.560 --> 30:46.560
This one's cooler though, the MPV.

30:46.560 --> 30:47.560
You don't need to use the window manager to do it.

30:47.560 --> 30:48.560
Yeah.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.560
Right.

30:49.560 --> 30:50.560
Yeah.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.560
I guess other than that, I mean, was there any other features that you heard about and

30:52.560 --> 30:53.560
any by the mumble room?

30:53.560 --> 30:54.560
Feel free to chime in to that.

30:54.560 --> 30:58.200
You're like, oh, as a Linux user, I kind of, I kind of would like to have that.

30:58.200 --> 31:04.240
I feel that they should totally, you know, since we still are dealing with X, maybe show

31:04.240 --> 31:05.240
us what they're using.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.120
That will be cool.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.120
Actually useful maybe.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.120
I don't know.

31:09.120 --> 31:15.680
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't really, I don't want to go, I just want to make a comment.

31:15.680 --> 31:18.320
I think the situation for Mac hardware right now is pretty poor.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.560
It really is.

31:19.560 --> 31:25.000
And I think there's an opportunity here for Linux because a lot of the things that drive

31:25.000 --> 31:31.560
people to, originally, that drove people to Mac OS was a nice graphical interface with

31:31.560 --> 31:35.680
a strong Unix underpinning, which is a lot like elementary OS, for example, or something

31:35.680 --> 31:40.360
like that, or Ubuntu desktop, we're about to talk about, that people are now aware of

31:40.360 --> 31:42.720
these alternatives.

31:42.720 --> 31:46.600
And it allows you to buy from any hardware vendor you want.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.560
And the problem is, in a lot of cases, Apple has set a pretty high bar for hardware quality,

31:50.560 --> 31:52.740
but it's not an impossible bar to surpass.

31:52.740 --> 31:56.200
And other, more and more manufacturers are doing so or getting close.

31:56.200 --> 31:59.880
And the problem is, is legitimately, you look at some of Apple's high-end hardware right

31:59.880 --> 32:03.440
now, like just as a thought experiment.

32:03.440 --> 32:09.040
Let's say you decided you needed to get yourself a very high-end workstation from Apple.

32:09.040 --> 32:12.520
Well, first of all, the first thing you'll notice when you go to buy from Apple is the

32:12.520 --> 32:15.440
only thing they're really advertising is their iOS devices.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.520
It's a little discouraging.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.520
You can't really...

32:18.520 --> 32:20.480
Oh, people still buy desktop computers?

32:20.480 --> 32:21.480
Yeah.

32:21.480 --> 32:24.920
So if we go look at the Mac, for example, and say we want to get the Mac Pro because

32:24.920 --> 32:28.280
we want something that has more than four cores.

32:28.280 --> 32:32.400
So I want something that has more than four cores, maybe because I have a large encoding

32:32.400 --> 32:36.240
workflow, or there's all kinds of situations where you need a lot of CPU.

32:36.240 --> 32:40.880
So if you want to get the Mac Pro right now, you are legitimately forced to use hardware

32:40.880 --> 32:46.880
that came out like three years ago, and the starting price is $3,000.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.880
Oh, man.

32:48.880 --> 32:51.400
And that's with not a very competitive system.

32:51.400 --> 32:55.240
This system is significantly less competitive than the computer I am showing it on right

32:55.240 --> 32:56.240
now legitimately.

32:56.240 --> 33:02.560
So if I wanted to go...I am displaying this on a quad-core...or I'm sorry, a six-core

33:02.560 --> 33:08.840
Skylake system, and this is three generations old quad-core starting at $3,000.

33:08.840 --> 33:15.640
Now what's even more egregious is, besides the 12 gigs of RAM and the only 256 gigabytes

33:15.640 --> 33:22.800
of storage, what's actually the most egregious thing on this page is the AMD Fire Pro D300

33:22.800 --> 33:25.000
GPU with two gigs of RAM.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.720
It is an ancient, ancient graphics card.

33:29.720 --> 33:34.800
And to upgrade, the best thing you can get is Fire D700s, which are like four-generation

33:34.800 --> 33:35.800
old GPUs.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.240
They were legitimately a generation old when this Mac Pro shipped.

33:39.240 --> 33:43.720
And the best you can get is a four-generation old graphics card, two of them for $1,000.

33:43.720 --> 33:44.720
That's crazy.

33:44.720 --> 33:49.640
You'd think there would be a lot of professionals that want to do this, especially with like

33:49.640 --> 33:50.640
machine learning, etc.

33:50.640 --> 33:56.360
Like there's so many stuff where you really do want like a nice GPU for professional work.

33:56.360 --> 34:00.600
I will claim that this is actually part of the smart move from Apple.

34:00.600 --> 34:05.760
As a developer, what has screwed up Windows developers has been that they're constantly

34:05.760 --> 34:06.760
shifting.

34:06.760 --> 34:08.880
You don't have a stable platform.

34:08.880 --> 34:13.360
People choose Ubuntu because they have the LTS and they can be sure that they target

34:13.360 --> 34:14.360
that.

34:14.360 --> 34:18.540
The fact that Apple doesn't go crazy on adopting new things so fast allows for someone to master

34:18.540 --> 34:23.680
and craft for that platform and then sell on that platform, which means profitability.

34:23.680 --> 34:32.360
I would argue that Windows XP and Windows 7 are pretty reliable targets as far as developer

34:32.360 --> 34:33.360
platforms target.

34:33.360 --> 34:37.280
But also, I think your argument would be probably easier to swallow if they reduce the price

34:37.280 --> 34:38.280
over time.

34:38.280 --> 34:42.720
They're still charging the original price when they launched that thing years ago.

34:42.720 --> 34:47.760
And I think the core point here is your scenario may be okay for some developers, but I think

34:47.760 --> 34:52.040
there's a group of people out there, even people who have enough money, who look at

34:52.040 --> 34:56.280
that and say that is just unfair to the customer.

34:56.280 --> 35:04.440
And I think I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, but in general, their platform does pay more.

35:04.440 --> 35:07.560
You develop for Windows, the money you make, you develop for Android, the money you make

35:07.560 --> 35:10.280
and you develop for iOS, the money you make, you do your math.

35:10.280 --> 35:17.000
I think perhaps people like Leo Laporte are a harbinger of exactly what I'm talking about.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.520
People who can afford to spend more but look at the commitment that Apple has to the Mac

35:21.520 --> 35:26.720
platform and go, Apple is way more committed to the iOS platform and now to their new services

35:26.720 --> 35:31.240
division and potentially to even building a car and they're not committed to their

35:31.240 --> 35:35.680
desktop and hardware platform anymore as they have been in the past.

35:35.680 --> 35:40.960
And so I can see very easily how people like Leo Laporte would look at that and go, well,

35:40.960 --> 35:43.440
I don't want something from the Microsoft camp because I don't like what they're doing

35:43.440 --> 35:46.840
with Windows and I don't like what Apple is doing with their hardware, so I'm just going

35:46.840 --> 35:52.640
to go with Linux, I'll find a desktop eventually that works for me and it has to be a certain

35:52.640 --> 35:55.960
enthusiast that's willing to do this, but I'll find a desktop environment that works

35:55.960 --> 36:00.600
for me and I'll find a piece of hardware that works for me and I will now just manage that

36:00.600 --> 36:05.120
marriage of hardware and software and not outsource it to Apple like I have in the past.

36:05.120 --> 36:08.040
And I think that's exactly what's happening right now, I just think it's a slow trickle

36:08.040 --> 36:11.400
that's going to speed up, especially as they continue to ignore their hardware.

36:11.400 --> 36:16.880
They just did their only one big event a year, one that is for developers and they didn't

36:16.880 --> 36:21.040
release a single piece of hardware for developers to use to develop for their platform.

36:21.040 --> 36:24.280
They have all developers enough for us to buy hardware that has years old components

36:24.280 --> 36:25.280
in it.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.520
That's a pretty bad state.

36:27.520 --> 36:34.440
I mean I know it has a cool Apple glowy logo on it, but at a certain point that brand attachment

36:34.440 --> 36:39.480
only goes so far and the practical person in you goes, wow, I can go get a ThinkPad

36:39.480 --> 36:42.760
or a Sputnik or a System76 or something.

36:42.760 --> 36:48.280
That's where the System76 really starts looking attractive, or similar offerings.

36:48.280 --> 36:53.720
Devices that people are targeting are also inferior devices anyway, aren't they?

36:53.720 --> 36:57.080
That's kind of what the point is, it's like if I'm targeting this inferior device and

36:57.080 --> 37:02.160
I can test it or run it in the developer machine I have right now, something's very wrong then.

37:02.160 --> 37:07.880
I can target those devices that they're building right now, the phones and the TVs and whatever

37:07.880 --> 37:12.640
the car system is, they're all going to be inferior and that's where the clients are.

37:12.640 --> 37:17.120
So if me as a developer, I'm buying a Mac as a developer, I don't need the super fancy

37:17.120 --> 37:18.640
thing, I need access to the platform.

37:18.640 --> 37:24.440
I need better software tools, which is the services that they are improving.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.320
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

37:26.320 --> 37:27.320
Pretty much.

37:27.320 --> 37:32.480
So did you guys hear about this rumor that Samsung is going to completely dump Android?

37:32.480 --> 37:34.760
Did you see this?

37:34.760 --> 37:35.880
How could this be?

37:35.880 --> 37:41.720
But apparently, this is from Fossbytes.com, so I don't know where they got their source.

37:41.720 --> 37:44.400
But they claim that the plan is...

37:44.400 --> 37:45.720
Oh, from the Korea Times.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.120
Yeah, oh yeah, there you go, thank you, from the Korea Times.

37:49.120 --> 37:54.200
They say that they did a launch in India, they sold lots of devices, millions of devices.

37:54.200 --> 38:00.080
The devices are being very competitive, they've said, and they've had a low return rate, customers

38:00.080 --> 38:03.400
are happy with the Tizen based phones.

38:03.400 --> 38:10.040
And according to this, they seem to think it's a great opportunity to go from their

38:10.040 --> 38:17.640
watches to the phones to their refrigerators to their television, Tizen, all the things.

38:17.640 --> 38:21.400
They say they've had 64 million phones sold they're running Tizen, and that it's proving

38:21.400 --> 38:22.960
to be very competitive.

38:22.960 --> 38:28.040
That's a lot of phones, I mean, not globally, not to the whole phone market, but just as

38:28.040 --> 38:29.040
a unit, that's interesting.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.200
I wonder how well they really do work.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.960
You think this is legit, Popey?

38:31.960 --> 38:38.120
Yep, I called it, I've been saying this for a very long time, that what Samsung are doing

38:38.120 --> 38:43.800
with their S apps is building a community and a familiarity with their applications

38:43.800 --> 38:50.240
and their app ecosystem and locking people into their app ecosystem rather than the Android

38:50.240 --> 38:51.240
ecosystem.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.240
But doesn't that...

38:52.240 --> 38:55.760
Normal people know two things, they know Apple phones and Samsung phones.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.760
Yes, that's very true.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.020
Normal people don't know about all those others.

38:58.020 --> 39:01.160
And when you're on a Samsung phone, you have all these Samsung things.

39:01.160 --> 39:07.640
My theory has been for some time that Samsung will just swap out the underneath and they'll

39:07.640 --> 39:12.120
rebuild all their S apps for Tizen and the user won't care because they'll still be locked

39:12.120 --> 39:15.440
into all the same S apps that they had on Android but on Tizen.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.960
We can stop complaining about TouchWiz.

39:17.960 --> 39:23.840
And if you look at a Tizen phone, it looks a lot like TouchWiz on Android.

39:23.840 --> 39:27.000
But hasn't the S apps been universally rejected by users?

39:27.000 --> 39:29.960
Don't people hate the S apps?

39:29.960 --> 39:30.960
I don't know.

39:30.960 --> 39:38.160
I mean, the places where these people who apparently have bought millions of Tizen phones

39:38.160 --> 39:41.280
don't really have the option of all the G apps.

39:41.280 --> 39:44.040
What's the size of the people that hate them versus the size of people who just use them

39:44.040 --> 39:45.040
because they're there?

39:45.040 --> 39:46.040
I don't even know.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.040
I don't have the answer.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.040
Yeah, default is game.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.040
Yeah, default is game.

39:49.040 --> 39:54.040
However, what I would say is I subscribe to a monthly mail that I get about the top 20

39:54.040 --> 39:57.800
apps in the Tizen store and I get this email every month.

39:57.800 --> 40:01.240
I signed up to be a developer on the Tizen store just so I can get this email.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.040
And it tells me which of the apps.

40:03.040 --> 40:07.320
And I've been looking at this for a year and it's the same 10 or 20 apps in the store for

40:07.320 --> 40:08.640
like the last year.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.800
Every so often a new one will come in, a new game or a new media player app or something.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.520
But it's basically the same 20 apps.

40:14.520 --> 40:18.860
So I don't think they have a massive developer community.

40:18.860 --> 40:23.220
And I wouldn't be surprised if they're using the Android runtime to leverage Android applications.

40:23.220 --> 40:25.440
That's what I was thinking.

40:25.440 --> 40:28.720
So the number one app in there is WhatsApp and I'm pretty certain that's an Android app

40:28.720 --> 40:31.160
and not actually a native Tizen app.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.920
That's the response to the chatroom too.

40:32.920 --> 40:38.480
Of course, if they can run Android apps, do you think they could even do the Play Store

40:38.480 --> 40:39.480
API?

40:39.480 --> 40:42.280
Is that possible?

40:42.280 --> 40:43.280
It's possible.

40:43.280 --> 40:46.520
How can you run Play Store API on another OS?

40:46.520 --> 40:48.640
The Play Store is Java.

40:48.640 --> 40:51.320
Tizen is JavaScript and HTML.

40:51.320 --> 40:54.880
But everything all uses the Linux kernel all in the base anyway.

40:54.880 --> 40:57.040
Android is pretty much Linux plus Java.

40:57.040 --> 41:00.440
Tizen is Linux plus JavaScript.

41:00.440 --> 41:06.480
So they can just shove the Android or at least their Java runtime in and it will be working.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.480
I see.

41:07.480 --> 41:08.480
How does this work?

41:08.480 --> 41:09.480
It's not taking into account the display server either.

41:09.480 --> 41:11.320
Tizen can use Wayland.

41:11.320 --> 41:12.320
Just like Sailfish.

41:12.320 --> 41:15.040
The Surface Flinger, a display server for Android.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.280
Yeah, well, I guess they can.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.560
I wouldn't want to use it.

41:19.560 --> 41:25.200
I would more want to go the Sailfish way and do Wayland on the mobile platform anyway.

41:25.200 --> 41:30.120
So heavens, there was a report just like a few days ago.

41:30.120 --> 41:33.920
Just came out, said, mobile users are not really installing apps anymore.

41:33.920 --> 41:37.720
They get five, six, seven apps that they use on a daily basis or frequently and then they

41:37.720 --> 41:41.240
pretty much, they might install something but they never use it.

41:41.240 --> 41:45.080
Do you think that factors into how Tizen could perhaps blow up larger than Android?

41:45.080 --> 41:48.600
Because you say you think it could go bigger than Android.

41:48.600 --> 41:54.240
Probably because of the developer base or the developers for JavaScript versus the enterprise

41:54.240 --> 42:02.200
Java who have just migrated over to Android as a benefit, but I guess they could get even

42:02.200 --> 42:08.480
bigger because one, JavaScript applications are all instant apps versus Android's new

42:08.480 --> 42:15.720
Android M or what, N's instant app new feature.

42:15.720 --> 42:22.120
Well, I think it's anyway, come on, Google's been pouring millions of dollars into JavaScript

42:22.120 --> 42:27.480
execution better than Java can ever be and you know, lawsuit crap going on.

42:27.480 --> 42:32.120
I think we look at it from too much of a technical possibility standpoint.

42:32.120 --> 42:38.360
I think maybe outside the US this could happen, but I just don't ever see this happening to

42:38.360 --> 42:47.040
... As long as Samsung in the US is trying to go against the iPhone, I don't see it happening.

42:47.040 --> 42:50.960
Chris, can I just point out how many billions of people live outside the US?

42:50.960 --> 42:51.960
Right.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.800
You know, I could see this totally taking, that's exactly my point is maybe in terms

42:54.800 --> 42:59.560
of scale, essentially they will have done this percentage wise just by doing this outside

42:59.560 --> 43:00.820
the US.

43:00.820 --> 43:06.680
But I don't think inside the US or any market I should say where they're commercially going

43:06.680 --> 43:09.080
after iOS devices.

43:09.080 --> 43:12.640
It just doesn't seem like that's going to be happening, that you can switch to a new

43:12.640 --> 43:13.640
platform and be competitive.

43:13.640 --> 43:14.640
Yeah.

43:14.640 --> 43:15.640
I don't know.

43:15.640 --> 43:16.640
It just doesn't seem like-

43:16.640 --> 43:23.560
But to target the TV and Samsung TVs are more than the iOS or whatever other TV, well that's

43:23.560 --> 43:26.760
a very compelling argument that nobody really has right now.

43:26.760 --> 43:30.080
Sure target the TV, target the phones, target the cars, target the watches and see where

43:30.080 --> 43:31.080
it takes them.

43:31.080 --> 43:32.160
And they have their Chromebooks too.

43:32.160 --> 43:34.600
So if they, you know, it's a step there.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.360
That'd be interesting.

43:36.360 --> 43:37.720
That would be interesting.

43:37.720 --> 43:42.400
Maybe soon we'll be running a Tizen desktop fork thing right here on the show.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.400
All right.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.400
All right.

43:44.400 --> 43:45.400
I'll get into that.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.760
I would love to, like even if I had to import it, I'd love to get that.

43:47.760 --> 43:51.920
It's funny because I say that I don't think Samsung will ever do this in the US.

43:51.920 --> 43:52.920
Personally I'd love it if they do it.

43:52.920 --> 43:53.920
It'd be fun to try.

43:53.920 --> 43:54.920
I would love it.

43:54.920 --> 43:57.880
Like from an enthusiast standpoint, I'd be like, yes please.

43:57.880 --> 44:04.280
A large scale manufacturer who can build high quality products relatively and ship them

44:04.280 --> 44:07.280
on a scale where I can actually go into a store and buy them.

44:07.280 --> 44:08.280
Yeah.

44:08.280 --> 44:09.280
That would be great.

44:09.280 --> 44:10.920
But I don't know.

44:10.920 --> 44:18.960
I just linked the Intel demonstrating Tizen on an Intel A7 Ultrabook in 2013.

44:18.960 --> 44:23.560
All right Hawkins, would you like to have the last word on this one?

44:23.560 --> 44:29.960
I just want to say that with Samsung, if we think back about the Nokia Symbian operating

44:29.960 --> 44:36.440
system, which Samsung also had access to, they didn't do any development when they did

44:36.440 --> 44:39.760
have access to the Symbian operating system.

44:39.760 --> 44:41.120
It's true.

44:41.120 --> 44:42.120
Yeah.

44:42.120 --> 44:47.000
Maybe they're going to compete with Google in like the ad space and make Advertisen.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Ooh.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Ba-dump-bump.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.160
And on that note, why don't we-

44:51.160 --> 44:52.160
Let's move on.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.160
Let's talk about Ting.

44:53.160 --> 44:54.200
Let's talk about Ting.

44:54.200 --> 44:58.360
Whenever you get your device, be it a Tizen device, an Android device, an iOS device,

44:58.360 --> 45:04.440
a feature phone, or even a Blackberry, heck I don't care, Ting is honey badger about this.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.440
It's real simple.

45:05.440 --> 45:07.280
They got CDMA and GSM and you pay for what you use.

45:07.280 --> 45:10.680
So you get a SIM card, you put it in your device, and you pay for what you use.

45:10.680 --> 45:12.040
It's $6 for the line.

45:12.040 --> 45:14.040
You want to have 10 lines, it's $6.

45:14.040 --> 45:15.860
You want to have one line, it's $6.

45:15.860 --> 45:17.860
You just pay for your usage, there's no contract.

45:17.860 --> 45:19.160
It's really this simple.

45:19.160 --> 45:23.440
I can't even believe I... Even after all this time, I can't really believe it's that

45:23.440 --> 45:24.440
simple.

45:24.440 --> 45:28.200
Hopefully, hopefully you do and you're willing to try it because it really is a game changer.

45:28.200 --> 45:31.240
I save over $2,000 a year by going to Ting.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.720
Average Ting monthly bill per line, $23.

45:32.720 --> 45:33.720
That's for your smartphone.

45:33.720 --> 45:36.440
You know, they just take your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, add them up

45:36.440 --> 45:37.440
and that's what you pay.

45:37.440 --> 45:43.160
You got CDMA and GSM to choose from and you can either buy a device from Ting directly,

45:43.160 --> 45:46.480
which is unlocked and you own it, there's no contract.

45:46.480 --> 45:51.720
Or you can bring a device and they'll give you a Ting credit if you go to linux.ting.com.

45:51.720 --> 45:55.180
linux.ting.com will also take money off your first device.

45:55.180 --> 45:56.520
They have great customer service.

45:56.520 --> 45:57.960
You speak to real human beings.

45:57.960 --> 46:01.800
They have a super nice dashboard that gives you features you never thought a mobile carrier

46:01.800 --> 46:03.800
would give you right in the webpage.

46:03.800 --> 46:04.800
I love that.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.040
Same with the Android app too.

46:06.040 --> 46:12.600
I don't use the Android app as much or there's also an iOS app, but that webpage, I just

46:12.600 --> 46:13.600
love it.

46:13.600 --> 46:14.600
I love it and I love the...

46:14.600 --> 46:17.400
Everything you need to do is right there.

46:17.400 --> 46:21.200
Just as an example, we have a couple of extra lines we turn on every now and then just when

46:21.200 --> 46:23.560
we have people in town and we can disable them.

46:23.560 --> 46:25.220
The process is very straightforward.

46:25.220 --> 46:26.220
I love it.

46:26.220 --> 46:31.600
The fact that we have CDMA and GSM means that when we're up north at Linux Fest Northwest,

46:31.600 --> 46:35.760
we use the CDMA network and when we're down here in Arlington, we use the GSM network

46:35.760 --> 46:37.920
and we get amazing service in both locations.

46:37.920 --> 46:38.920
And you get to choose.

46:38.920 --> 46:40.280
I love it.

46:40.280 --> 46:41.400
Try going there right now.

46:41.400 --> 46:42.400
Check them out.

46:42.400 --> 46:43.400
linux.ting.com.

46:43.400 --> 46:46.160
$6 per line.

46:46.160 --> 46:47.160
That's nuts.

46:47.160 --> 46:50.920
You can also call them at 1-855-TING-FTW.

46:50.920 --> 46:52.080
Talk to a real human being.

46:52.080 --> 46:55.160
It is mobile that makes sense.

46:55.160 --> 47:01.960
linux.ting.com and up on their blog right now, they have an article about using Ting

47:01.960 --> 47:05.440
for gamers which is really cool.

47:05.440 --> 47:08.160
So we're going to talk about snap packages.

47:08.160 --> 47:11.840
We got to talk about snap packages but first before we get into the snap package discussion

47:11.840 --> 47:16.720
which this is huge news today, there's also a little bit of news this week, just something

47:16.720 --> 47:21.000
I want to touch on before we run away with the rest of the show and that's the new Loki

47:21.000 --> 47:22.160
beta that's out.

47:22.160 --> 47:25.880
The elementary OS folks put out a beta of Loki.

47:25.880 --> 47:27.360
It's totes early stuff here.

47:27.360 --> 47:29.800
It is not meant for your daily driver.

47:29.800 --> 47:33.280
You shouldn't use it if you are expecting a stable, reliable desktop.

47:33.280 --> 47:35.120
It's really to give them feedback.

47:35.120 --> 47:37.140
That's what this is about.

47:37.140 --> 47:41.200
But it's something that's kind of interesting because it's sort of a closely watched distribution

47:41.200 --> 47:47.640
because it doesn't do traditional betas and development in the sort of daily release tradition

47:47.640 --> 47:51.760
that a lot of distributions do like when there's a new version of Ubuntu itself coming out

47:51.760 --> 47:56.040
at any point in the development cycle, you could go get the latest ISO or you could go

47:56.040 --> 47:59.720
jump in at Fedora Rahai at any point or Debian unstable, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

47:59.720 --> 48:01.040
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

48:01.040 --> 48:03.260
But that's not how elementary OS does it.

48:03.260 --> 48:08.240
So when they actually put a flag down on the ground and say, OK, the beta is out.

48:08.240 --> 48:09.240
You can go try it.

48:09.240 --> 48:11.080
We had to give it a look.

48:11.080 --> 48:15.360
And so besides reiterating that beta means beta, they say that they've shipped a new

48:15.360 --> 48:17.000
set of toys for developers.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.580
They've upgraded the notifications, better notifications.

48:20.580 --> 48:23.880
No unsafe software sources.

48:23.880 --> 48:28.400
But also there's a few things like a new app center or whatever they call it in there and

48:28.400 --> 48:29.400
stuff like that.

48:29.400 --> 48:30.400
Tell me about it, Wes.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.400
What do you think?

48:31.400 --> 48:32.400
What are your first impressions?

48:32.400 --> 48:33.400
You've been running it this morning.

48:33.400 --> 48:34.400
Yes, I have.

48:34.400 --> 48:38.040
I'm doing it right here, doing all my show prep, et cetera, on it.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.160
So far, mostly good.

48:39.160 --> 48:42.720
I mean, there's like some small things you can tell that they're still working stuff

48:42.720 --> 48:46.640
out like if there's no default associated thing with.deb files anymore.

48:46.640 --> 48:49.520
So if you want to install those, you can't double click, you need to go into the terminal,

48:49.520 --> 48:50.520
et cetera.

48:50.520 --> 48:52.120
You can change that if you want to.

48:52.120 --> 48:57.480
But I will say it installed easily, very quick.

48:57.480 --> 48:58.480
It really didn't break anything.

48:58.480 --> 49:01.360
It installed nicely on the three other operating systems I have here.

49:01.360 --> 49:02.360
Loads really fast.

49:02.360 --> 49:06.800
It has a very smooth graphical, not a lot of like you don't see the frame buffer terminal

49:06.800 --> 49:07.800
or anything like that.

49:07.800 --> 49:10.040
It really goes like right to the desktop, loads up.

49:10.040 --> 49:15.240
And in typical elementary style, the animations are smooth.

49:15.240 --> 49:16.240
Might not be a lot there.

49:16.240 --> 49:21.200
But I admit for my own tastes, elementary is just enough different from GNOME that it's

49:21.200 --> 49:26.380
like the commands are different and the shortcuts are different, like the layout, but it's similar.

49:26.380 --> 49:27.380
But it's really nice.

49:27.380 --> 49:29.320
And just all the little things, you can tell it's polished.

49:29.320 --> 49:32.840
You can tell like every feature that they've put in, they really want to be nice and to

49:32.840 --> 49:33.840
be complete.

49:33.840 --> 49:42.840
So do you, when you're using it, do you have the sense that it is indeed a Ubuntu family

49:42.840 --> 49:44.540
member, or does it feel like its own beast?

49:44.540 --> 49:48.600
And so what I'm asking you is, do you sort of have the, do you sort of have the background

49:48.600 --> 49:52.440
confidence knowing that you're using a desktop that's part of a larger ecosystem, or does

49:52.440 --> 49:55.280
it feel like it's sort of off on its own island?

49:55.280 --> 50:00.000
On the surface, I mean, it doesn't, there's not a lot of clues.

50:00.000 --> 50:05.560
Here I am looking at the app center, and it's kind of just, it's very minimally, very minimally

50:05.560 --> 50:06.560
branded.

50:06.560 --> 50:08.200
It's just kind of, yeah.

50:08.200 --> 50:11.920
But as more of a power user, I do appreciate that I can just open a terminal, apt-get is

50:11.920 --> 50:12.920
right there.

50:12.920 --> 50:13.920
I see that.

50:13.920 --> 50:14.920
I see everything.

50:14.920 --> 50:17.760
So this here is the, they call it the app center.

50:17.760 --> 50:21.600
We don't have a visual of it because Wes's machine isn't hooked up to the capture.

50:21.600 --> 50:30.320
So this is their own custom app that, or is it based on, is it based on GNOME software?

50:30.320 --> 50:31.320
I'm not sure.

50:31.320 --> 50:32.320
We should look into that.

50:32.320 --> 50:33.480
I think it's actually based on GNOME software.

50:33.480 --> 50:34.760
It does look similar, yeah.

50:34.760 --> 50:39.900
Yeah, but it looks like it has much nicer categories, broader, yeah.

50:39.900 --> 50:42.000
So that's a new feature for sure.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.200
They have the app hub as well.

50:44.200 --> 50:46.620
What is the app hub running?

50:46.620 --> 50:49.960
It's a new thing that they're going to do, which is like the app center is going to be

50:49.960 --> 50:51.480
like the store that you get.

50:51.480 --> 50:57.480
The app hub is where everything is going to be provided from, and like a third-party store

50:57.480 --> 50:58.480
type thing.

50:58.480 --> 51:03.360
So that you push to the app hub, the app hub pushes packages to the app center that people

51:03.360 --> 51:04.360
can install.

51:04.360 --> 51:05.360
I see.

51:05.360 --> 51:08.280
Wes, try going into the settings or switchboard or whatever they call it there, and check

51:08.280 --> 51:10.920
out the new sharing settings in there.

51:10.920 --> 51:14.440
I guess there's a couple other things, there's new online account plugins, printer support

51:14.440 --> 51:16.880
replacing the old one, and there's also new mouse.

51:16.880 --> 51:17.880
Oh yeah, here we go.

51:17.880 --> 51:19.040
Yeah, so what do you see when you go into sharing?

51:19.040 --> 51:20.480
The first thing is media libraries.

51:20.480 --> 51:23.880
You can just choose to share music, videos, pictures.

51:23.880 --> 51:24.880
They're all turned on by default.

51:24.880 --> 51:25.880
Oh, cool.

51:25.880 --> 51:26.880
All right.

51:26.880 --> 51:27.880
Oh, no.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.040
The whole thing is disabled if you enable it.

51:29.040 --> 51:30.760
All of those are turned on by default.

51:30.760 --> 51:31.760
Okay.

51:31.760 --> 51:32.760
Have you checked out, have you gotten any new notifications?

51:32.760 --> 51:36.080
I guess a new notification indicator was added to the panel.

51:36.080 --> 51:39.440
You know, I have seen a few, and I'm waiting for some processes I'd run with pseudo to

51:39.440 --> 51:40.440
complete.

51:40.440 --> 51:42.640
They pop up a little like, oh, hey, your process is done.

51:42.640 --> 51:43.640
That's nice, isn't it?

51:43.640 --> 51:44.640
Yes.

51:44.640 --> 51:45.640
It feels very slick.

51:45.640 --> 51:46.640
Yeah.

51:46.640 --> 51:47.640
I like how Fedora does that too.

51:47.640 --> 51:48.640
I do.

51:48.640 --> 51:49.640
But just for the terminal.

51:49.640 --> 51:50.640
So where is their notification tray thingy at?

51:50.640 --> 51:54.560
They say it goes up in the – oh, okay, yeah, oh, yeah, it's this little bell right

51:54.560 --> 51:56.280
here, and it has a nice do not disturb toggle.

51:56.280 --> 51:57.280
Have you seen that?

51:57.280 --> 51:58.280
Yeah.

51:58.280 --> 51:59.280
That seems like it will be very useful.

51:59.280 --> 52:00.280
It's really clean looking.

52:00.280 --> 52:01.280
It's nice.

52:01.280 --> 52:02.280
Yeah, that's the thing.

52:02.280 --> 52:06.560
It's like, you know, as someone who does like to tinker and I run Arch, etc., etc.,

52:06.560 --> 52:09.520
I can see where some of these things might bug me or I might be like, I really wish I

52:09.520 --> 52:10.840
had that feature or I could do it.

52:10.840 --> 52:15.840
But if you just are using the computer or like especially kind of this laptop, I use

52:15.840 --> 52:19.320
it for show stuff, but it's not my daily driver, so I don't do a lot of my main project

52:19.320 --> 52:20.720
work, development, anything on it.

52:20.720 --> 52:25.280
So if I just want to browse the web and have a laptop that connects to Wi-Fi and suspends

52:25.280 --> 52:28.760
and comes back every time, it seems like it might not be a bad fit.

52:28.760 --> 52:29.760
Yeah.

52:29.760 --> 52:34.040
Anybody else have thoughts about elementary OS and the Mamba Room before we move along?

52:34.040 --> 52:35.040
I'll probably –

52:35.040 --> 52:36.040
Yeah, I think –

52:36.040 --> 52:37.040
Yeah, go ahead.

52:37.040 --> 52:38.520
That needs to be some – just one quick note.

52:38.520 --> 52:43.000
If you're wanting to use PPAs, you need to install the App Repository tool.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
Yes, you do.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
That's a good point.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.840
Because by default, they disabled it.

52:46.840 --> 52:50.960
So there are some considerations like that for like power users that may be more inconvenient

52:50.960 --> 52:51.960
than convenient for you.

52:51.960 --> 52:54.520
That seems like a pretty clear message there, that it's not for power users.

52:54.520 --> 52:55.520
Yeah.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.520
Hmm.

52:56.520 --> 52:57.520
And that's okay, too.

52:57.520 --> 52:58.520
That's fine.

52:58.520 --> 53:01.720
I mean, it's not really – not every distribution out there is – it needs to be for me.

53:01.720 --> 53:02.720
No, right.

53:02.720 --> 53:03.720
Absolutely.

53:03.720 --> 53:06.440
Like I may not use it, but it might be something I could recommend for my mom to use, no problem.

53:06.440 --> 53:07.440
Yeah.

53:07.440 --> 53:11.520
My son is running the last release of elementary OS, and he's been running it for over a year.

53:11.520 --> 53:12.520
Just totally solid.

53:12.520 --> 53:15.520
And there are some times where like you need that – you might not like their aesthetic,

53:15.520 --> 53:16.520
but they do have an aesthetic.

53:16.520 --> 53:17.520
Yeah.

53:17.520 --> 53:19.560
And there are some users, especially people who maybe are more designers or artists or

53:19.560 --> 53:24.880
like who have an expectation from other operating systems that it is clean or it is simple or

53:24.880 --> 53:29.040
it is just pretty in some way, and elementary might fit there, too.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.040
Mm-hmm.

53:30.040 --> 53:36.480
I think when you look at elements of it, I look at that and go, if I use my computers

53:36.480 --> 53:40.240
differently, I would – I could see myself really being a good elementary OS user candidate

53:40.240 --> 53:45.800
because I do like the consistent visual language that's just everywhere through the whole

53:45.800 --> 53:46.800
thing.

53:46.800 --> 53:50.380
I like that they take care of certain things like the sharing stuff there, like the notification

53:50.380 --> 53:55.080
stuff there, the thought that goes into it, the very consistent – from the moment it

53:55.080 --> 53:59.040
powers up to the desktop, it's very consistent feeling.

53:59.040 --> 54:03.040
That is all indicative of a lot of intention.

54:03.040 --> 54:04.040
Exactly.

54:04.040 --> 54:07.920
And that intention, I respect a lot.

54:07.920 --> 54:12.560
And so when I'm using something and it delights me in a way that I go, oh, wow, somebody really

54:12.560 --> 54:17.940
thought about that, and I have just a brief moment of insight into, they must have really

54:17.940 --> 54:19.580
agonized over this choice.

54:19.580 --> 54:22.480
And I think to myself, I'm so appreciative that they did that.

54:22.480 --> 54:25.720
I do enjoy using systems that make me feel that way.

54:25.720 --> 54:28.200
And that's one of the reasons I like using GNOME because I often feel like there's things

54:28.200 --> 54:31.320
in GNOME 3 that do that for me.

54:31.320 --> 54:34.920
So there is a part of me that wishes I could be the perfect user for this.

54:34.920 --> 54:40.000
But then, of course, the software availability would kill me, just kill me, because I would

54:40.000 --> 54:41.000
want PPAs.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.200
And I would want to add stuff all the time, and all that.

54:43.200 --> 54:46.200
And I mean, you can't do it just for cars, right?

54:46.200 --> 54:47.200
Yeah.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.200
One install.

54:48.200 --> 54:50.120
I feel like, though, that I'm obviously going against some of those intentions.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.120
Right.

54:51.120 --> 54:52.120
Are you going to break some things?

54:52.120 --> 54:53.120
Are you going to have to – yeah, you're fighting the system.

54:53.120 --> 54:58.880
Those very intentions I claim to think were great would seem to be in violation.

54:58.880 --> 55:03.120
However, that all could be changing.

55:03.120 --> 55:04.120
Right.

55:04.120 --> 55:05.120
There are new things on the horizon.

55:05.120 --> 55:06.360
There are things afoot.

55:06.360 --> 55:12.120
Like we mentioned in the intro, there is apparently a Linux packaging cold war that we have been

55:12.120 --> 55:13.120
on the front line.

55:13.120 --> 55:14.120
Where do you stand?

55:14.120 --> 55:16.560
Where do you stand in the war?

55:16.560 --> 55:17.560
Are we being cray-cray?

55:17.560 --> 55:19.400
Are we overstating it?

55:19.400 --> 55:22.440
Or is there actually really some interesting developments?

55:22.440 --> 55:25.320
All of those things are true.

55:25.320 --> 55:28.640
By the way, links to the Loki beta if you guys want to grab it and let us know what

55:28.640 --> 55:31.080
you think.

55:31.080 --> 55:32.080
Have we had a couple of dropouts?

55:32.080 --> 55:33.080
Oh, okay.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.080
Yeah.

55:34.080 --> 55:35.080
Sorry, guys.

55:35.080 --> 55:36.080
The storm is picking up.

55:36.080 --> 55:37.080
Sorry about that.

55:37.080 --> 55:38.080
Can you hear us okay, Wimpy?

55:38.080 --> 55:39.080
Is it all right?

55:39.080 --> 55:40.080
I can.

55:40.080 --> 55:41.080
Good.

55:41.080 --> 55:42.880
But I remember that you lost a load of stuff once.

55:42.880 --> 55:43.880
Yeah.

55:43.880 --> 55:44.880
Yeah.

55:44.880 --> 55:45.880
We have a backup recording going.

55:45.880 --> 55:46.880
Uh-huh.

55:46.880 --> 55:47.880
I tell you what.

55:47.880 --> 55:48.880
I tell you what.

55:48.880 --> 55:51.040
This new OBS rig has worked out unbelievably well.

55:51.040 --> 55:58.040
I was just talking on the livestream like it runs 24-7 and never crashes.

55:58.040 --> 55:59.480
It just runs, runs, runs.

55:59.480 --> 56:02.080
And Wirecast could not live up to that.

56:02.080 --> 56:06.520
It has shown itself to live up to a workload that Wirecast could never sustain.

56:06.520 --> 56:07.520
That's awesome.

56:07.520 --> 56:13.720
Wirecast is really to use it fully as a $1,000 product that's been around for a lot of years.

56:13.720 --> 56:19.360
And OBS in terms of life cycle, they rebuilt it not too long ago.

56:19.360 --> 56:20.880
It's still kind of new.

56:20.880 --> 56:25.580
And yet when they seem to do releases, at least the versions we've installed so far

56:25.580 --> 56:27.880
have been extremely reliable.

56:27.880 --> 56:32.040
Maybe they don't have necessarily all the whizbang features I need at this moment.

56:32.040 --> 56:40.080
But the fact that thing, I mean, it's probably been 20 days that it's ran solid.

56:40.080 --> 56:41.080
It's really something.

56:41.080 --> 56:43.960
And we had some issues on Sunday, and it wasn't that machine.

56:43.960 --> 56:44.960
It was Comcast.

56:44.960 --> 56:47.120
And when we do have problems, it tends to be Comcast.

56:47.120 --> 56:48.120
Go figure.

56:48.120 --> 56:49.120
Open source for the win.

56:49.120 --> 56:50.120
Yeah.

56:50.120 --> 56:51.120
Exactly.

56:51.120 --> 56:52.120
It's really amazing.

56:52.120 --> 56:53.120
It really is amazing.

56:53.120 --> 56:55.000
And it helps that...

56:55.000 --> 56:56.320
What a cool project.

56:56.320 --> 57:00.680
It helps, too, that it is available on the Linux machines.

57:00.680 --> 57:01.680
A solid operating system.

57:01.680 --> 57:02.680
Yeah.

57:02.680 --> 57:03.680
Because Linux is also very solid.

57:03.680 --> 57:07.680
So I think a solid piece of software running on top of a solid operating system is just

57:07.680 --> 57:09.920
a really great combo.

57:09.920 --> 57:10.920
And thank you.

57:10.920 --> 57:16.200
Really, the credit there for that system being as good as it is goes really to Rekai and

57:16.200 --> 57:19.400
Noah, who stayed up all hours of the night, several nights in a row, making it work.

57:19.400 --> 57:20.400
Right.

57:20.400 --> 57:21.400
And failed components.

57:21.400 --> 57:22.400
Yeah.

57:22.400 --> 57:23.400
Googling like crazy.

57:23.400 --> 57:25.760
So really the credit goes to the Beard and to Brown Bear.

57:25.760 --> 57:31.440
But we shall move on to Canonical's big announcement, which may solve my software availability complaints

57:31.440 --> 57:32.640
for elementary OS.

57:32.640 --> 57:34.800
But first, let's mention Linux Academy.

57:34.800 --> 57:38.200
In fact, go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

57:38.200 --> 57:41.880
All of you right now, go there and test the link, because we had a bit of an outage the

57:41.880 --> 57:42.880
other night.

57:42.880 --> 57:43.880
Oh, no.

57:43.880 --> 57:44.880
Yeah.

57:44.880 --> 57:45.880
So help me test it.

57:45.880 --> 57:46.880
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.600
Then dig around on their website.

57:48.600 --> 57:53.440
They have 2,471 self-paced courses where you can obtain experience and learn as you go

57:53.440 --> 57:57.300
with scenario-based labs that put you in the middle of everyday common tasks, instructor

57:57.300 --> 58:02.000
mentoring when you need help, and graded server exercises that automatically grades your actions

58:02.000 --> 58:05.440
so you can see how well you did, which is really nice.

58:05.440 --> 58:07.440
Really, really nice, especially for those of us that don't test well.

58:07.440 --> 58:10.960
They, of course, work on Python and, of course, Linux and all the technology around Linux

58:10.960 --> 58:13.800
and Android and that DevOps category.

58:13.800 --> 58:14.800
OpenStack, yep.

58:14.800 --> 58:15.800
Yep.

58:15.800 --> 58:16.800
That's a thing.

58:16.800 --> 58:17.800
Python, Ruby.

58:17.800 --> 58:18.800
AWS?

58:18.800 --> 58:19.800
Oh, AWS.

58:19.800 --> 58:20.800
Fo' show.

58:20.800 --> 58:23.520
There's also something they're calling social cards, which—

58:23.520 --> 58:24.520
What is this?

58:24.520 --> 58:25.520
Tell me more.

58:25.520 --> 58:26.520
I don't know.

58:26.520 --> 58:27.520
My first thought was like, what?

58:27.520 --> 58:28.520
Some cards?

58:28.520 --> 58:29.520
What?

58:29.520 --> 58:30.520
No.

58:30.520 --> 58:31.520
They're like, you know, no cards for like learning.

58:31.520 --> 58:36.280
And you can fork them and build upon them, and there's a reputation system built in.

58:36.280 --> 58:37.280
Wow.

58:37.280 --> 58:38.280
All of this now in Linux Academy.

58:38.280 --> 58:41.040
They have a great community of people who are all super motivated, and tons of them

58:41.040 --> 58:46.960
are Jupyter Broadcasting members, that are now going to be, well, if you want at least,

58:46.960 --> 58:49.640
involved in the process of making these cards better.

58:49.640 --> 58:53.760
They're doing a $200 Amazon gift card giveaway for like the first 10 best stacks or something,

58:53.760 --> 58:54.760
so you can get in early.

58:54.760 --> 58:55.760
What a cool community.

58:55.760 --> 58:56.760
Yeah.

58:56.760 --> 58:59.000
So get started by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.020
It comes with your own server, seven plus distros to choose from, modifies the courseware

59:03.020 --> 59:07.160
and the server, spins it up on demand, enhanced learning plans, detailed, comprehensive notes

59:07.160 --> 59:11.320
you can download and keep with you, and like I mentioned, instructor mentoring for topics

59:11.320 --> 59:15.520
that most other online learning sites would completely gloss over.

59:15.520 --> 59:19.240
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

59:19.240 --> 59:23.560
Now I know we have talked a lot about universal software installation, and I hope the audience

59:23.560 --> 59:25.440
is not worn out.

59:25.440 --> 59:29.960
The sense I get is you all are sort of – the majority of you think, I've heard this one

59:29.960 --> 59:30.960
before.

59:30.960 --> 59:33.440
I don't have any sense that this is going to go anywhere.

59:33.440 --> 59:34.440
Why are we talking about this?

59:34.440 --> 59:37.600
That's kind of the general sense I've gotten back from the audience.

59:37.600 --> 59:41.720
However, I have felt for a while now that there is really some serious momentum here,

59:41.720 --> 59:43.280
more so than we've seen in the past.

59:43.280 --> 59:47.720
XDG app, now known as Flatpaks, and of course, AppImage, and we've been talking a lot

59:47.720 --> 59:49.700
about Snap packages on Ubuntu.

59:49.700 --> 59:50.700
In the abstract.

59:50.700 --> 59:56.480
Now today, today, some pretty big news came out.

59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.620
I kind of smelt it coming, and you might have as well, Snap packages are launching on multiple

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:02.620
Linux distributions.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:08.140
Essentially, the Snap is going to be available for pretty much all major distros.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:12.000
Launching with some great partners right out of the gate, including Docker and Telegram

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.680
packages, and I think Corita is in there, and LibreOffice is in there, and they have

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:24.880
packages available for CentOS, and Elementary, and Gentoo, and Mint, and OpenSUSE, and Red

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.560
Hat Enterprise Linux, and Arch Linux, and all of those distros can now install Snap

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:30.560
packages.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.480
It's Snappy time, everybody.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:40.200
Snap packages are here for everybody, and I look at this and I go, brilliant move by

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.200
canonical.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:46.880
Mark Shuttleworth said, one thing is definitively clear about today's announcement, I'm paraphrasing.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.760
This is not about Ubuntu.

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.520
This is about all the other Linux distros.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:56.360
Now I thought that was an interesting thing for Mark to sort of stress, that this is like

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:02.280
the antithesis of being about Ubuntu is what he said.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:07.360
He also pointed out the Flatpak, the new GNOME XEG app initiative, is 95% of the contributors

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.680
came from one Red Hat employee.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.680
I love it when he does that.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.680
I love that.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.600
He said he'd be delighted if they'd work with us.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.600
God, that's so great.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.600
It's so good.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.920
Yeah, so the Document Foundation's got LibreOffice.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:30.080
Dell Mozilla is partnering up with them, Samsung, and Arch and Fedora can run and install Snap

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.080
packages.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.840
I installed it right before the show.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.400
You have installed an elementary OS.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.400
I do.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.160
I'm not sure it's 100% working, but it's installed anyway.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.560
Did you get the telegram pass?

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.240
You know, it's giving me an error when I try to launch it, but the rest is working.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.240
I got SnapD going.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.240
I can do SnapList.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.240
I can do SnapInstall.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.240
Interesting.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:46.240
It's probably user error.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:52.640
So, Rotten, let's start with you, and then I'm going to bounce around some questions.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.000
You've gotten your hands on it during the show.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.400
What are your initial impressions?

01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:01.520
Yeah, so I started using it earlier in the show, and Snap is great.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.720
And two things are really shocking.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.280
NextCloud came out.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.760
They announced a new version today.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.560
There is now a Snap for it today.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.400
And I just installed Krita, which by default, when you use apt, it installs like 500 megs

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.040
of dependencies.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.480
The Snap was only 98 megs.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.480
Wow.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.480
Okay.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.480
All right.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:30.240
I don't know how that happened, but that sounds very promising.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:34.920
I wanted to ask Wimpy, because I know he's had some experience recently with Snap packages.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:39.880
Wimpy, do you think it's now just come down to a race of who can get the most packages

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.520
by the biggest names?

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:47.920
Because you've got Flatpak, AppImage, Orbit, Orbital, whatever it is, and now Snaps.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.080
And it seems like whichever one, since they all work across all the distributions, whichever

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:56.160
one ends up being the sort of go-to to have the most and best software is going to be

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.160
the winner.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.160
Don't you think?

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.160
Maybe.

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.160
Yeah.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:06.320
Definitely, there's some first mover advantage there, and there's been a lot of people coalescing

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:10.800
around Snaps and Snappy.

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.960
Like QNAP recently announced that their line of NAS devices are going to be moving to Ubuntu

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.960
and Snaps.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.960
Yeah.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.960
That's pretty cool.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.640
And they're going to be packaging all of their ancillary services and IoT bits and bobs as

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.560
Snaps rather than shipping them in the traditional way.

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:31.920
So I think Snaps might be edging out at the moment, but time will tell.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:32.920
Yeah.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:39.880
It seems also the KDE project is experimenting with packaging Neon as a Snap, which is really...

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:40.880
That's interesting.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:41.880
Yeah.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:45.200
And the other thing that Ubuntu have done is they've reached out to people in the other

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:54.000
distributions to get Snap working on the other distros, and I'm not sure if that's happened

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.280
the other way.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:02.720
So the fact that Snap works in all these different places is because Ubuntu developers and community

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:08.800
members have made the effort to try and make that happen, to make it the cross distribution.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.480
So they're reaching out to those distros and saying, hey, would you like to work with us

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.480
on this?

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.480
Yeah.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:17.160
So that's a huge component of it, too, getting more and more adoption.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:23.720
And not just cross distribution, but also across the flavors within Ubuntu and inviting

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.240
people and there's been a real effort the last two weeks.

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:32.600
It's a shame I've been on holiday for most of it, but yeah, there's been a real effort

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:38.920
to involve people and bring them up to speed and share knowledge and tips and tricks and

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.600
push the platform forwards and learn from one another.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:46.320
Now, what about the concern that the back end isn't open source to Snap packages?

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.800
Poppy, is that a thing?

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:50.100
Is that a thing people are complaining about yet?

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.160
Is that a misunderstanding?

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.160
Which back end?

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.880
So Snap D is open source.

01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:56.880
So Snap-

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:57.880
Help me understand.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.880
The registry, right?

01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.880
Yeah, like this.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.600
Is there like a central registry I can search for Snap packages and that's locked up?

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.760
There is a store and we run the store and I don't know what the license on that is.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.760
It currently isn't free software.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.240
I don't know what will happen with that.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:16.680
But who runs the store doesn't impact who can download a Snap and just install it on

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.600
their system, right?

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.000
The two things are not dependent?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.020
You can certainly sideload Snaps.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.320
You can grab a Snap from anywhere.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:30.280
So for example, initially the Krita developers put a Snap as a downloadable file on their

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.280
website.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.280
Or like I-

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.280
Just like a dev, right?

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.640
I just downloaded the Telegram Snap to my desktop.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.640
Right.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.320
So you can certainly do that.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.640
And yeah, currently the store is non-free.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.640
I don't know what the plan is for that.

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:48.680
And I don't know what the plan is for supporting multiple different stores either.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:54.440
I know that discussions have been happening there because some people will want to have

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.480
all the devices within their own estate only talking to other devices within their own

01:05:58.480 --> 01:05:59.480
estate.

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:00.480
Sure, right.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.080
And they don't want them to reach out of their network and go to some third party store

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:09.280
and allow their users to install random Snaps that could contain games or stuff they just

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.280
don't want.

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.560
And so I know those discussions have happened, but it's early days and I don't know where

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.560
that is at the moment.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:21.440
And then we have SnapD, which is an open source piece of software that seems to be the thing

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.760
that has to be specifically packaged for each distribution to make all of this work, to

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.580
make the cross distribution component work.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:32.840
So there is an Arch package, there is a Fedora package, there is an OpenSUSE package of SnapD,

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:36.320
and that is the sort of bits and-

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.320
The shim layer.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.320
Yeah.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.320
You needed to install Snaps.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.360
Am I tracking that right, Poppy?

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.360
Yeah.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.640
There's multiple parts to it.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.320
The SnapD part is, yeah, the bit that needed to be ported.

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.600
And that's the bit that we already have pre-installed on Ubuntu.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.440
So we're halfway there.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.440
And that's GoDemon, right?

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.080
Yeah, it's written in Go.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:02.520
And the Snaps themselves get installed and removed by SnapD.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:06.840
And there's a front end to SnapD, which is just called Snap.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:13.060
So you can do commands like snap list to list all the Snaps that you have installed.

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:17.280
And that would be the same as you using apt or dpkg to see what you have installed.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:21.800
And then you would do something like snap find, which is where you go out to find out

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.920
what packages are available in the store or in the archive or whatever you want to call

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.920
it.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.400
And, you know, that's the equivalent of apt search or whatever.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:35.040
I feel like people are going to misinterpret that as, oh, well, Snaps are trying to replace

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.520
my distribution's package manager.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.640
Could you already see, oh, look at Canonical.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.800
They think they're coming out with a package manager for all distros.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.800
It's not really.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.800
Go ahead.

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:47.320
Yeah, I don't know.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:52.260
What I think would be preferable is if you see it from the point of view that your distribution

01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:59.960
is giving your users the platform, your platform, which is the value that you provide in that,

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:00.960
whichever that is.

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:01.960
Sure.

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:07.800
There's package freshness in Fedora, that's clean upstream gnome.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:13.600
And in Gentoo, it's, you know, build it the way you want it.

01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:18.100
You know, however, whatever, whatever your platform is, what we're providing is the ability

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:26.880
for the users to get absolutely the freshest things from upstream in a secure manner.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.760
Yeah, I actually am.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:32.720
I don't know what universal package format is going to win out.

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:33.720
But this, to me –

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.040
We can even just get one.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.040
Oh, that would be –

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:40.880
I'm really, really – I would love to have one that has a company behind it that has

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.480
a reputation in the open source community.

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.480
That seems like a pretty important –

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:48.160
Yeah, Linux has a history of like resolving these things and only having one of everything.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.160
That's right, isn't it?

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.160
We only have one of everything.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.160
Very good at that.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.160
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:55.760
Yeah, but we do have – but I could see a dominant one.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.000
I could see a dominant one emerging.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.400
And the – boy, excuse me.

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.160
The launch across multiple distros on day one –

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.160
Huge.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.160
Smooth.

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.160
Real smooth.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:11.280
The fact that I could just – it was just in the AUR immediately and I could just go

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:13.560
grab it and install the Telegram snap.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:19.320
I was kind of surprised that didn't leak out, that people didn't spot things appearing

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.840
in various archives and people say, hello, look at this.

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.840
What's this doing here?

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.840
I had heard some rumbling.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:25.840
I had heard some rumbling.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:26.840
But –

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:27.840
Okay, so maybe people didn't –

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:30.600
Me and my little Ubuntu bubble, I didn't spot that.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:35.480
I thought – I just – I don't actually know if this is going to be it, but I – even

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:39.400
if it's a well-supported one, the momentum you've already seen behind snap packages

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.400
is really good.

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:41.400
Oh, you like?

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.400
What do you got there?

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.400
What do you got there?

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.400
Look at that.

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.400
Are you pasting from the web?

01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:46.400
Yes, I am.

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.400
Okay, so read that error message on your screen.

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:49.800
So I'm pasting into the terminal from the web.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.280
Copying commands into the terminal can be dangerous.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.840
Be sure you understand what each part of this command does and then in big red button, paste

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:58.600
it anyway, which I am about to hit.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.000
Look at Loki warning you about the dangers of pasting commands from the web, which is

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.840
ironic because a couple of – like LibreOffice was the one.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.480
Ham Radio was telling me he was downloading LibreOffice using a snap package and the post

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.800
just tells you to use wget and has the app get install command and all this stuff.

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.200
Just copy and paste this into your terminal and you'll be good to go.

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.200
You'll be fine.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:21.640
Yeah, that's not a good idea.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:24.880
The warning about using – copying and pasting things in the terminal was actually in the

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.880
last version too.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:26.880
I'm not sure about that.

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.880
I think – yeah.

01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:29.680
It's still nice to see.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:32.960
I think this is a pretty huge development, getting snap packages for all distros.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.680
I don't know where it's going to go for sure but to me, I have always struggled with

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.040
– this is really a first world podcaster problem.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:46.240
But when I talk about an app or we do a desktop app pick on the Linux Action Show, I experiment

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.480
with, well, what do I do here?

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.240
Do I link to the open source of build service?

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.240
Do I link to the AUR?

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.360
Do I link to a deb and an RPM?

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:56.580
And I have experimented with doing all of them and it just feels ridiculous.

01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:03.080
And so what I have defaulted to doing is I generally link to maybe the Ubuntu version

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:08.120
somewhere and the version I installed from the AUR or something like that because that's

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:11.520
the one I did so you can reproduce what I've done.

01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:16.960
And the ability now to say just go here and download this snap and whatever distro you've

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:22.200
chosen is going to work for you now, like Telegram and Herupad and Mumble, is going

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.200
to be a huge shift.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:31.520
And if this all goes well enough where it's adopted by a majority of application publishers,

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:36.080
there could become a point in time where we simply just remember a time before snap packages

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.680
and then there's life after snap packages.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.760
Matthew Feeney Exactly.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.840
I will say as well like I'm just – I've been using LexD a lot which is also another

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:46.480
Go daemon written by Ubuntu and I've been quite pleased with it.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:51.840
So I think if Snappy is of similar quality, I could be OK with this as being the universal

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.840
package.

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:53.840
Trevor Burrus Look at them using Go.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:54.840
Hopi, do you have any – do you know anything about this?

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:58.800
Is Go sort of like canonicals, not to be punny, but go-to language?

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.720
Hopi Kile Yeah, it's funny.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:05.000
I remember when I very first started at the company.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.960
So three and a bit years ago, I remember Mark evangelizing about – Mark Shalworth evangelizing

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.200
about Go and saying it was the next big thing.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:18.760
And like this is obviously pre some of the other new things that have come out from Google

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.800
and Apple and Microsoft and so on.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:28.720
But it – he was evangelizing it for a while some time ago and now a lot of the developers

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:33.820
have picked up on that and said actually it is quite a nice language to develop in.

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:37.260
And so a lot of the tools like – but even if someone's just hacking together a little

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:42.000
command line tool, they'll do it in Go or a daemon, they'll do it in Go.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.400
It seems quite popular with developers as well.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.280
Ryan Lewis Yeah, I get a lot of good feedback about Go

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.780
and Rust and Dakota Radio.

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:53.400
And people seem to feel like Go is really something special and wonder why Google doesn't

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400
use it more themselves.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.820
Rod and I guess I'll give you a chance to chime in here as somebody who's packaging

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:01.200
up applications for different distributions.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.760
This has got to be potentially offering a big relief.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:08.280
Now how much do you expect users to actually go out and enable snap support on their distro

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.280
of choice though?

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.840
Ryan Lewis Well, hopefully it'll become – in a while

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:18.440
from now I expect, but hopefully it will become a normal thing.

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:26.880
Even if Ubuntu, the base of Ubuntu and all the flavors were just snaps and everybody

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:30.520
else use flat packs or App Images or whatever, I don't care.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:36.720
That's at least tenfold better than what I currently have to do.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:43.880
So for my – every time I make a new release, I have to – I've made 19 packages for

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:44.880
everything.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:51.880
So I have – and that's not even the maintenance where I have to contact the maintainers of

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:53.920
each distro for packages we don't make.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:57.500
So I have to deal with those two and then I have to make sure that the package builds

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:01.880
and the e-builds are all up to date and things like that, which they're not always.

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:07.320
And then – and that doesn't even take into account that I have to make new versions.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.240
I have to make different packages for each version of a distro.

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.120
So like Fedora 22, Fedora 23.

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.840
So every time I make a new release of our app, we also have to make a new package for

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.960
that distro and every version of that distro that's still currently supported.

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.480
So for like Ubuntu, we have like four.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:31.760
So we have so many packages we have to make and just – and if we have three new universal

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:38.280
things that take over, I would be so ecstatic for that, just to have three rather than 20

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.280
or whatever.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.280
Wow.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.280
That's funny.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.240
On the subject of packaging, we've done a couple of events last Tuesday and this – or

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.600
a couple of days ago on this Tuesday.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:53.160
We did a thing called the Snappy Playpen and the idea was that we would create a GitHub

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.360
repo in which we just dump the configuration file.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:01.800
So to make a snappy package, there's a YAML file, a plain text YAML file that describes

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:02.800
the build of the application.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.800
It's pretty straightforward.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.680
Anyone can read it and it's not hard to break up.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:12.640
But we – you know, Snap is quite new and we've been finding all the various edges

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:17.600
and pointy sharp places that we mustn't touch and it's a learning exercise for us

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:23.500
as well as people like Rotten who is developing his apps and wants to package them up.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:28.280
So we've been doing this and packaging a random bunch of applications, some of them

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:35.000
less random kind of well-chosen applications in order to find those pointy sharp places

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.920
so that we can educate other people on how to package stuff up.

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:42.560
So when they say, okay, I've got my GNOME app or I've got my KDE app or I've got

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:47.720
my C++ OpenGL app, how do I package it up as a Snap?

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:52.520
And we could just point them at this GitHub repo and in there are examples.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:57.080
So we're not necessarily uploading all of these to the store, they're upstream programs

01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:02.900
like for example, I packaged up MindTest, the free software Minecraft clone.

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:10.880
So if you want to see how to package up an OpenGL C++ application and it packages it

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.520
from the tip of Git, so you could run this command SnapCraft in order to build yourself

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:20.600
a Snap package which is bleeding edge nightly build.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:26.000
So you could run a cron job potentially, a cron job which built you a Snap package overnight

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:31.320
every night and uploaded it to a nightly version to the store so every day your users get the

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:32.880
freshest version.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:39.160
I rotten, you had a response to that and there's a bit of a but in it I think.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.940
No, not really.

01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:45.640
It's more of a hopefulness.

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:51.360
So the point that Peppermint was making about how the upstream is controlling it, that is

01:16:51.360 --> 01:17:00.920
something I've been begging for at least 10 years now even though there was never even

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:08.120
on the radar but I've been hoping for something like that for years and when I contact a maintain

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:13.060
of an app to get my app updated in the repos, it could take anywhere from a couple days

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:16.960
to a year and a half before I get a reply.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:22.800
It's a horrible process that I understand why people have a problem with packaging for

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:28.780
Linux really but with the fact that Snappy allows for the upstream maintainers and developers

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:33.880
to control when stuff gets updated and pushed to the users, that is something I've been

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:39.080
waiting for and I am so excited I'm like beside myself.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.740
So what you just touched on is exactly, I've talked about it before but we've been recently

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:48.600
talking about Nextcloud and Frank and Frank and I had an off the record conversation that

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.120
was sort of on the record in the sense that he knows I've been telling this story for

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:54.760
years now.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:59.540
He had a very sort of unfortunate fight with Debian for a while because they were shipping

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:04.800
such old versions of own cloud repo that users were installing version 7 when version 8 would

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:08.280
be out or something like that or version 5 when version 8 would be out was actually the

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.280
case.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.280
It was really bad.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:15.800
They were riddled with security, no longer getting updates and he said really our pace

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:20.160
of development, the features that we are adding to stay competitive, the methodology in which

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:24.360
we publish it, all of it, it's just – it's more appropriate if it comes directly from

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.360
us.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.360
It just works better for the end user.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.360
It's more secure.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:33.840
We can support it plus we don't end up having to answer support questions for five versions

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:34.840
of software.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.560
So from a developer standpoint, I think people are really encouraged.

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:41.160
Just like that screensaver mess that's going on in Debian right now.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.160
Yes, exactly.

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:45.320
And, you know, I think here's what it would really take.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:50.160
I think Snap packages, if they could benefit from the Docker effect, I think it would be

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.160
like wildfire.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.160
Yeah.

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.100
What really did – what really for Docker, what you were able to do, you could be just

01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.000
the laziest Linux user ever.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.720
You could be like one of those – not to insult you guys, but one of those web developers

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:08.080
that uses a Mac and then SSHs into his Ubuntu server and Docker came along and all of a

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.720
sudden you didn't have to deal with actually installing Linux software.

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.160
You could just pull down a Docker image and boom, you had it in time.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:14.640
Someone already provisions it for you.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.640
Yeah.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:17.320
Oh, you want a Minecraft server.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.320
You want a Mamo server.

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.320
You want an own cloud server.

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.320
You want a Zimbra server.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.320
Yeah, just pull down this Docker image.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.320
It's good to go.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:27.480
If Ubuntu – if Canonical can get enough adoption around Snap packages where I can

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:32.960
install what we as Linux users used to consider extremely complicated installations, things

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.520
like entire desktop environments.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:40.920
If I can reduce installing an entire desktop environment down to one or two Snap packages,

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:45.440
if I want to try out the latest Plasma desktop, I can download a single or maybe four or whatever

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:49.600
it is Snap packages and I have that entire thing and I haven't mucked up all the depths

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.600
on my system.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:53.960
I was about to say, the other nice part is like when you want to remove it, done, gone.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:54.960
Your system is going to be –

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.440
Another example, Ardour.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:00.000
Ardour is universally known as one of the harder applications to install and get everything

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000
working.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.760
If I can pull down a single Snap package, double click that and have a working installation

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:07.640
of Ardour and you multiply this across all of the little edge cases in Linux where it's

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:12.040
hard to get this particular thing set up or it involves trashing your entire system with

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:17.240
libraries from something and you start solving that problem and get enough projects behind

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:24.960
it that people want, I think the idea of having to install SnapD first is – well, that's

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.680
a no-brainer because that's even easier than getting Docker set up.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:30.440
So there is a bit of a Docker effect that could happen.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.440
Go ahead.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.280
I think I agree with you.

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:38.120
What you're suggesting really is there needs to be the killer app.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:42.640
So I've been looking at – as part of this Snappy Playpen thing is looking at what are

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:49.800
apps that people really want and that are often updated with very high velocity, a fast

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:56.680
cadence like Nextcloud, that people want the bleeding edge version but other people might

01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.680
want a stable version.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:03.640
So you could have two snaps, a nightly and a stable and one of the ones I looked at today

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:10.720
was Ardour actually and so I started building a Snap for Ardour today and Audacity as well

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:15.340
and I came across a couple of bugs which are being filed and those will be fixed but yeah,

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:19.680
those are exactly the kind of apps and the cadence lives and the things that move quickly

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:21.040
where you want the latest thing.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:26.600
I packaged up a Snap for FFmpeg because everyone wants the latest codecs and all that kind

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:27.600
of stuff.

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:28.600
Oh, from everyone.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:29.600
Thank you.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.600
So yeah, and MPV as well.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:31.600
I did MPV today.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.600
MPV was super easy.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.120
That was like not hard at all.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.040
So yeah, it's good fun.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:42.300
And so now when you install the MPV Snap, will it automatically – how does it get updated?

01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.680
So this is the thing.

01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:50.880
When I was creating the Snapcraft configuration, the idea is that I would then give this to

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.360
the upstream developer and say, here you go, here's the configuration, here's how you

01:21:54.360 --> 01:22:00.200
make a snap because rather than burden them with yet another packaging format, I just

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:04.880
tell them this is the configuration file, you run this command on a Ubuntu system and

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:09.840
you'll get a snap out of it or if you want to, you can push your code or mirror your

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:15.300
code to Launchpad and Launchpad will build you a snap for you much the same way as it

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:19.640
builds devs in a PPA and then you can just push that to the store as and when you're

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.640
ready.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.640
And if you want, you can have two channels.

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:25.160
You can have a channel for beta tester users and a channel for stable users.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:29.920
So some of your people might be wanting the bleeding edge version and you can canary out

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:33.560
to them and then they can play with it and then you can push it out to your stable users.

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:35.100
See, that's pretty nice.

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.400
So you would get updates when the developer uploads them.

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.720
I don't intend to upload MPV or mind test to the store.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:47.680
I intend to put a contribution to upstream and say, here's how you package it.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.360
You upload it to the store because then they control it.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:50.360
They can see the stats.

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.360
They can see all that.

01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.320
And they maintain it.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:54.320
That is really cool.

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:57.240
And so you're doing a few proof of concepts there and saying, hey, if you want to know

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.120
how I did it, here's all the here's all information.

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.840
Yeah, we're putting it all on GitHub.

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:06.080
If you just go to GitHub and search for snappy playpen, you'll find them all.

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.080
That I don't know.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:10.240
I feel like there's going to be a bunch of naysayers that will say this competes with

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:13.800
OBS in this way and this competes with that in this way and this is not invented here

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:14.800
syndrome.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:19.320
But I part of me, I actually think canonical would have had a good degree of success if

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:23.120
this would have been Ubuntu only and if this technology never would have left the Ubuntu

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.120
platform.

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:29.640
And the fact that not invented here one is quite funny, though, Chris, just as a little

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.640
like nugget of information.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:37.080
If you look at the very first commit done to snappy, it was done on the 12th of the

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:40.280
12th, 2014.

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:45.080
If you look at the very first commit done to XDG app, it was done five days later on

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:49.160
the 17th of the 12th, 2014.

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.160
So they're very close.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.000
I don't know who could call that.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
It's very close.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000
And I think, you know, I think part of it is I think we have to sort of change the mindset

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
a bit.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.680
What we have to do is I think it's reasonable to expect Canonical to spend their time and

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:05.560
resources developing something that's ideal for their platform.

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:13.120
I think it's actually sort of surprising that you guys went to the effort to actually package

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:16.600
it up and push it out further because you really never had to do that.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:17.600
That never really had to happen.

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.600
It could have been …

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:20.600
How dare we be good citizens in the Linux environment?

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:26.600
It could have been a nice competitive edge, I suppose.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.120
You guys are a big enough ecosystem that you could have made it work.

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:32.480
I just think it's – even though it's another option, I think it looks like a pretty

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:35.400
good one and I think it has – there's a lot of positives to it.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:38.920
I'm not saying I necessarily know if it's going to be the winner but I like the start.

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.480
The start seems pretty strong and the partners already on board seem pretty good and the

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:47.040
potential for it just being useful within the Ubuntu ecosystem seems strong.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.360
So overall it seems kind of like a winner just depending on how much adoption it gets

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.360
from here.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.920
I guess we'll just wait and see like so many other things.

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:58.480
But I know what I think probably pretty much going forward, I will be installing Snap D

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.200
on my Arch systems.

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.440
Why not?

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:05.680
I think that's kind of a big thing.

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:08.200
I haven't – I guess I did get Flatpak working too.

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.920
I do have Flatpak support too but – and I have done an app.

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:15.880
I wonder when we'll start seeing like meta wrappers around these things or like an AUR

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.480
built-in kind of support thing.

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:21.880
I feel like someone at home or in the car right now is like pulling out their hair though

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:26.000
and wants to argue with us because we haven't heard a lot of opposition in the virtual lug

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
today.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.520
So that either means that people sort of universally think it's probably kind of a good thing

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:36.280
or that person who doesn't agree hasn't been properly represented.

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.080
If that's you, you should join us next week.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.080
Join our virtual lug.

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.080
That's right.

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:43.600
Because we'd love to hear from you or you can leave us a comment at linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.600
We love those too.

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:46.480
You'll find episode 149 listed there.

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.240
Links to the stuff we talked about like Snap packages and all the other things will be

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:51.240
in the show notes.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:52.240
You'll find episode 149.

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.160
We do the Unplugged program on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv and go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:00.280
slash calendar to find out when we're live.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:04.400
Probably can look forward to some NOAA stopping by in the future too when I go out around

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.400
the first week of July.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.400
That's always an adventure.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.400
Yeah.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:08.400
Yeah.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.400
All right everybody.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.400
Thanks for joining us.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.680
Remember you can follow live announcements also at Jupiter Signal.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:14.680
That's always handy as well.

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:38.360
See you next Tuesday.

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:50.000
You know I was just thinking about it.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.520
Really the benchmark where I'd be happy for Snap packages to get to would be if when I

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:59.880
get new people to switch over to Linux I can just say download this file and install this

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:00.880
program.

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:01.880
Yeah.

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:02.880
And it doesn't matter which distro they've chosen.

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:06.600
I know there's a high probability that most of the apps are going to want the Snap package.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.300
That's really the only that's the bar.

01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:09.320
That's really the bar for me.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:14.280
Do Snap packages work on GNU slash K windows?

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:15.280
I mean it does.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:16.280
Actually.

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:17.280
I wonder.

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:18.280
Yes they will.

01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.280
They have to.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.280
Yeah.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.280
I mean why not right?

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.280
They would have to.

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:25.840
Because the subsystem is 14.04 but when they update to 16.04 it theoretically would.

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:26.840
Awesome.

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:28.840
Are they going to update to 16.04?

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:29.840
And how does that work?

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:30.840
Just talk about it.

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:31.840
Yeah.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:32.840
Does that come down as a Windows?

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:36.840
I guess it would be like a Microsoft store update for your new Ubuntu 16.04.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:39.080
Oh it's gross.

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.080
My brain hurts.

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.080
It's gross.

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.080
All right.

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.080
JBtitles.com.

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:44.080
JBtitles.com.

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:49.600
It's funny because people are going to talk about it how like the flat packs are people

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:54.720
are already saying that Snappy wasn't good because it wasn't cross distro and stuff.

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:59.960
So now that that's done people can pick up other things to complain about.

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:03.640
But I think it's fantastic and I don't care which one is taking over.

01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:05.680
I just want something to take over.

01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:11.420
And a fundamental problem with the Linux ecosystem is the package distribution.

01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:17.840
As someone who's maintained and developed on basically every angle because I work in

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:23.760
distros and I also make software, it is one of the most frustrating things of being a

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:24.840
Linux user.

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:30.600
I understand when a company says that's too much work because for the most part they're

01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:37.520
right and Snappy and flat pack and whatever provides a solution to that fundamental problem

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:45.800
we've had for so long that I am – I could not be more excited for the horrible experience

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.840
of package distribution to be over.

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:48.840
Yeah.

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:54.960
I think it's – I think it serves – it still remains a well tool – how is the right

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.960
way to say this?

01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:00.600
It's the right tool for maintaining the distribution and the core distribution packages.

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:05.800
It seems like it's probably not the right tool for a lot of applications we distribute

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:06.800
over the web now.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.800
Right.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.800
Yeah.

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:17.520
Chris, I think you've said before repos and downloadable distros 15 years ago, Linux

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.160
and Linux distros were way ahead of the curve compared to commercial OSes.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.160
Totally.

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:27.720
We had a little bit of an advancement when PPAs became a thing but it's been stagnant

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:34.920
for a while and Apple with the iTunes store, Microsoft is trying to replicate things with

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:35.920
the Windows store.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:36.920
Right.

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:37.920
They caught on.

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.120
They realized, oh, hey, we need a store.

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.640
We need a central distribution system.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:51.720
So I guess here's where I'm going to dissent is how do we keep the benefits of a centralized

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:58.840
download repository and the security and the assurances that gives users while also easing

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:02.360
the difficulties for distribution and for package maintainers.

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:07.120
I think the way this happens is you have to have two components.

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:12.080
You have to have the front-end component and I think you already have canonicals fork or

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:16.920
whatever you want to call it of GNOME software that is going to work with snap packages,

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:17.920
does work with snap packages.

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:18.920
It already does.

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:19.920
Yeah.

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.520
There's no reason that couldn't be reincorporated back into mainline GNOME software I would

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:22.520
assume.

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:23.640
So there's your front-end.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:28.400
Then I would imagine if this thing really took off and people were really shipping software

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:34.140
and businesses who depend on it to maybe earn a revenue are shipping software, I bet the

01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:39.720
pressure on canonical to open source any remaining behind-the-scenes bits would be – they would

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:40.720
probably just do it.

01:30:40.720 --> 01:30:44.200
I mean they would probably do that as part of, well, this thing has grown beyond our

01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:45.200
initial vision.

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.620
It's now sort of become part of the ecosystem.

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:48.620
So here's the last remaining bits.

01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:51.160
And even if not, that will just get re-implemented if it's big enough.

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.160
Exactly.

01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:53.160
Exactly.

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:57.360
So my concerns would definitely be satiated if each of the districts, if they rely on

01:30:57.360 --> 01:31:05.320
GNOME software, being able to read and understand flat packs and snaps so that – again, I

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:10.760
guess the biggest thing that I don't want to see come from this is that, oh, I heard

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:18.000
about this great new app, whether it's Telegram or New App X, and I just go to a random website

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:25.680
and download it as a noob because even if it is secured, even if it is sandboxed, is

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.640
it still trustworthy?

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:28.640
Yeah.

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:30.000
How do you avoid that though?

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.160
Because I see that every time I switch somebody over to Linux, that's the first thing they

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:35.400
do is they go Google it and go try to download it from the website.

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:36.400
Right.

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.400
It's just built in.

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.800
They never even think about the App Store or a repo.

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:40.800
It's just not even –

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:44.440
Some even like Mac users and stuff where they're supposed to use that.

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:47.600
You know, it's like you just – you type it into Google and you hit download and it's

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.600
supposed to work.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.600
So how do you avoid that?

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:50.600
Yeah.

01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:55.560
So many Windows users that I see coming over, they're used to – first thing they do

01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:00.840
once they get a new Windows box up, they download night-night installer or night-night installer

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:07.720
to go download 7-Zip and LibreOffice and all of these other random binaries from the internet.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:11.840
I show them Ubuntu Mate Welcome and I'm like, well, this is 10 times better.

01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:12.840
Yeah.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:13.840
But you see, here's where I feel like.

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:18.560
I feel like Snap packages sort of provide for both because you have GNOME software.

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:22.440
You could easily integrate it into – well, not easily, but there could be future improvements

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:29.440
to Mate Welcome to support Snap packages and also there is that back-end repository that

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:32.760
if you integrate with Launchpad or the back-end index.

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:36.880
So if you could convince a user just to use a front-end piece of software to do all the

01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:39.200
searching, Snap packages provide for that.

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:43.920
But if you can't convince them, Snap packages also provide for at least a semi-streamline

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:49.120
standardized and hopefully secure way to do downloads off the web directly when users

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.120
opt to go that route.

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:52.260
So it seems like it provides for both.

01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:53.760
And I would also agree.

01:32:53.760 --> 01:33:04.480
So my hope is that Snap Packagers and the up-streams do buy into both pieces.

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:10.440
They see the benefits already with the ease of packaging and the improvement that has

01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:15.880
over working with distro maintainers, but they also buy into the back-end integration,

01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:22.280
whether it's linking to Launchpad or GNOME software or whatever the case may be.

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:26.760
Well I mean there could also be something like the UAP Explorer things.

01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:30.880
I mean right now it's kind of messy, but if there was a website that just catalogs

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:36.640
everything that's in the Snap store, and then all you need to do is click a button

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:41.420
that would then activate either GNOME software or just load it up a thing to start installing

01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:43.600
from the Snap.

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.600
They don't really care.

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:47.720
They're just used to going to on the web and finding it.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:52.160
So if you say there's a store you could use it, like awesome, great, we'll do that.

01:33:52.160 --> 01:34:01.440
If they just search by out of the normal expectation and they find something like the UAP Explorer

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:05.440
and they just click the install button, they don't care if they're downloading or not.

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:08.720
They would probably prefer it if it would just start installing.

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:17.360
So if you solve both of those issues of their expectation and also embrace the new store

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:21.760
concept, I think that they would have no problem transitioning whatsoever and would probably

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:39.080
like it even better.
