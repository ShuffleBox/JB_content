1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Hey, Wes, I heard you pulled your first all-nighter of the year.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,920
How's that going?

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,640
Yeah, I think it's something of a milestone.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,080
I mean, it is probably the first time I've seen dawn in a while.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,200
But that's like a silver lining, I think.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,400
Wow, what happened?

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,880
Well, sometimes you have a lot of work on your plate.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,080
Sometimes you're really in the zone.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,960
And you just want to finish your task.

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,120
You want to make sure things are working so that you

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,960
can have some consistent bedtime.

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,680
I see.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,440
So I used to do this when I was in my 20s.

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,200
And if I were to do it today, it would

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,640
be like I had gone out drinking all night the next morning.

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,360
I would feel rough.

17
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Yeah, it's been a long time.

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,560
This was my first all-nighter in a while.

19
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,280
And that's how I know I'm definitely getting there.

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:55,400
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
My name is Chris.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
My name is Wes.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,520
And my name is Brent.

24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,720
Hello, gentlemen.

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,520
It is going to be a really fun episode this week.

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,640
Coming up on the show, we're going to talk about a Linux

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,280
superpower that we've overlooked these days.

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,380
It's something that snuck up on us.

29
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,200
And now we take it for granted.

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,080
And it wasn't always a trick that Linux had.

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,360
It's the live session.

32
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,660
They're amazing.

33
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,600
And there's something that the Windows and the Mac don't really offer.

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,860
So this week, we're going to chat a little bit

35
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,840
about the history of the live session, how it came to be.

36
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,560
And then we're going to share a few times.

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,720
And hopefully, our mumble will have a few times that it totally saved our bacon to have

38
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
a live session.

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
Oh, yeah.

40
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,960
That's definitely a thing.

41
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,800
So before we go any further, let's say time-appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

42
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Hello, mumble room.

43
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Hello, hello.

44
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Hello, hello.

45
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
Hello, Chris.

46
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Hello, Wes.

47
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
And hello, Brent.

48
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Namaste.

49
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,880
And then today, we have a real special episode, I guess, because we have a meetup happening

50
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
here at the studio.

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,000
So everybody out in the living room, say hello, time-appropriate greetings to the living

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,840
room.

53
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,840
Hello.

54
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,480
Amazing.

55
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Nicely done, everybody.

56
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,480
Yeah.

57
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,480
We have the meetup happening right here.

58
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,120
We're going to do a little podcast thing.

59
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,260
I don't know if you heard of it.

60
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,620
And then after this, we're going to all eat.

61
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,400
So if you hear a bunch of noise and ruckus in the background, that's because we've got

62
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,560
a living room full of folks that are talking and enjoying themselves some cookies and snacks.

63
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,760
As they should be.

64
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,460
Maybe a few of them are having some bruskies.

65
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,960
And we even have some stashed champagne that Brent thought I had before he left for Canada.

66
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Yeah.

67
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,760
I want to be part of the show, part of the experience.

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,920
But I knew I couldn't be there in person.

69
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,640
So I thought, I'm going to hide some stuff around the studio and tell you about it in

70
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,280
very calculated moments.

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
So there you go.

72
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Nice.

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
Well, thank you.

74
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,360
So we have Wes and I have some champagne to celebrate the occasion.

75
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,920
The folks out in the living room have got a TV and a speaker going so they can hear

76
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
the show.

77
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
It's one big happy family over here.

78
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
It is.

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
It is.

80
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,920
So we were kind of talking as a group off air about different Linux installers and how

81
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,480
only a few of them now, like SUSE, offer the ability to just boot right into an installer.

82
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,280
Most Linux distros these days, they boot right into a live desktop session and you get to

83
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,160
try the whole desktop out.

84
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,280
You get to see if your hardware is supported.

85
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,960
And then sometimes they'll auto start an installer or sometimes they'll have like an icon on

86
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
the desktop.

87
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
And this has just kind of become the norm.

88
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
Yeah.

89
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Yeah, definitely.

90
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Every day.

91
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
Linux experience now.

92
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,160
You kind of, sometimes you even have to get a separate, like just installer ISO if you

93
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,640
even want that functionality.

94
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,920
And it wasn't always this way, Wes, no.

95
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,200
In fact, that was not the norm at all.

96
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,940
The way it used to be is you'd get a Linux installer CD, it'd do some sort of hardware

97
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,740
detection dance and it'd boot up into a minimal X environment that sometimes you even had

98
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,280
to configure before it could start and then you would just go through the installer.

99
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
Say it ain't so.

100
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
It is so.

101
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,300
And I don't really necessarily mind that experience, but it didn't give you an opportunity to find

102
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,200
out if everything that you had on your machine was supported by Linux.

103
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,580
And that was especially back in the day, one of the gotchas, you install Linux and discover

104
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,880
your modem doesn't work or your wifi doesn't work or your sound card doesn't work.

105
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
It was a problem.

106
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Yeah, right.

107
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,420
One of those things you find out only after you've gone through the full install, you've

108
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,440
rebooted, hopefully you've even got, you know, grub or lilo working, right?

109
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Yeah.

110
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,800
So the idea of a live CD really was something unique and it was indeed a CD.

111
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,760
We called them live CDs and they were very, very slow.

112
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,120
And you to make all this work, you had to have stacks of blank CDs.

113
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,640
Well, we all did at that time.

114
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,200
Yeah, I get like the Costco tower, you know, and I'd have like a whole bunch of like TDK.

115
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,960
Then hopefully you have like a spindle you've already used.

116
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,360
You kind of got like a queue system.

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,480
You load up on the new spindle.

118
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
Right.

119
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,760
The older distros kind of work their way to the bottom, you know, pile of used Sharpies

120
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,160
on the floor.

121
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,560
Totally.

122
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,600
And the early CD-ROMs were slow as hell too.

123
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,040
And they got faster over time.

124
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,160
And then like, were you taking the time to go check and verify that you burned it?

125
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
No.

126
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
Okay.

127
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,160
Okay.

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
No.

129
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
Living on the edge.

130
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,520
I also like would experiment with a bunch of different ways to burn these ISO images

131
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
to a CD-ROM.

132
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,680
I think I ultimately looking back on it, K3B was my favorite experience.

133
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,680
Nice.

134
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,880
Do you have any recollections of burning CD-ROMs?

135
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,560
Because there were so many, so many options to burn CD-ROMs under Linux back in the day.

136
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
Yeah.

137
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,320
I don't know that I ever really settled on a favorite.

138
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,440
I do remember, though, having access at the time I was working at like a computer lab

139
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,240
and they had a big CD duplication machine.

140
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
So that was pretty nice.

141
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,960
You could put, you know, pop one in and then just give away a bunch of CDs to people.

142
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Yeah.

143
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,680
Well, and really early on before the live Linux CD took off, there was a format war

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
in CD-Rs.

145
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,880
You had CD-ROMs and CD-RW and CD-RAM and there was all these different standards.

146
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,200
And some of them you had to put the blank CD in a cartridge.

147
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,640
I don't know if you recall these.

148
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Oh, yeah.

149
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,800
You had a plastic cartridge and then you'd put that cartridge into the burner.

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,240
Honestly, that seems like a good idea.

151
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,960
Why are we touching these CD?

152
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
It's gross.

153
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,200
You see the fingerprints on there.

154
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,360
So the funny thing is, that is kind of the model that a lot of the banks standardize

155
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,960
on is so for banking and backing things up, they felt like that was the best medium for

156
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,360
like write once and preserve forever.

157
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,840
So because it didn't become the predominant standard, the banks would have to buy the

158
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,840
drives.

159
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,320
Of course, I know this because I was hooking these up.

160
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,040
The banks would have to buy the drives at like 900 bucks a pop.

161
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Of course.

162
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
And then you have to get the jewel cases.

163
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,840
You got to get just the right format of blank CD and the whole thing.

164
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,400
And they had crappy Windows software.

165
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,080
There's so many crappy Windows software.

166
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
Oh, yeah.

167
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,800
Colonel's talking about Nero, the Nero ISO format.

168
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,280
Yeah, that was definitely a staple.

169
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,520
So this meant that you really had a hodgepodge patchwork approach to getting these CDs actually

170
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
functional.

171
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,360
It was not just as simple as DD an image to a USB or go get Etcher.

172
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Right.

173
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,120
This is a few hurdles to even try and try this stuff out.

174
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,360
I'm just saying to try out a distro, I had to walk uphill both ways.

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
That's what I'm saying.

176
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
OK.

177
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,360
And I just want you to appreciate that.

178
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,040
But you end up with a bootable CD and of course, you'd have to have a BIOS that allowed you

179
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,240
to boot off of your CD ROM, figure out how to like go access the boot menu.

180
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,240
Yeah.

181
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,880
And then you'd get that going.

182
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,720
And of course, it would be slow as hell.

183
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,760
But we were going to sit here and kind of tell you a little bit about the history until

184
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,920
we realized there was a big piece of this whole world that we didn't really know about.

185
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,380
And we started looking into it.

186
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,520
And the history of live CDs is a little more complicated than Knoppix.

187
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
It turns out.

188
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Yeah.

189
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,760
In fact, I don't know how you pronounce this first one, which I don't think is in production

190
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
anymore.

191
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,500
But it's what do you think, Wes?

192
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,080
It's why DD or I'm sorry, why Gigi?

193
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,240
Yggdrasil is, I believe, the most common way to say it.

194
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,000
So English speakers typically say Yggdrasil, but it's Yggdrasil in the old Nordic way.

195
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,180
Silent G's, right?

196
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,180
Pretty much.

197
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,180
I see.

198
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,380
This one passed me by.

199
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,600
It came out in 92, ceased production in 95.

200
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,440
It was really alive between 92 and 93, though.

201
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
That one kind of passed me by.

202
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,480
But that's for a live CD.

203
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
I know.

204
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,820
A live environment at that time.

205
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,560
When CDs themselves were such new technology at home.

206
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Right.

207
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,240
Yeah, we're not talking about live floppies here.

208
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,720
But the one that did catch my attention and made me realize something was going on was

209
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,400
released in 1998, and it was called Demo Linux.

210
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,120
And it was specifically designed to fit on these business card CDs that were actually

211
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
turned out to be a horrible idea.

212
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,120
But I don't know if you ever saw these, Wes.

213
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,280
They were like cut down CD ROMs.

214
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,400
Just big enough for like a label.

215
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,480
And if you had like one of those CD drives where you had to insert the CD, it would jam

216
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
the drive.

217
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Well, of course.

218
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,680
And then like the small little tray and yeah.

219
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,360
But I was at a very early Linux Fest Northwest, and there was a booth that was handing out

220
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,160
these little business card live CDs, and it blew my mind that you could have a whole live

221
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,000
Linux desktop environment in there.

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,560
Linux Care also released a business card bootable live CD in 1999 that was focused on system

223
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,640
administration.

224
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,480
This is where the first kind of brand positioning as a way to rescue your system started with

225
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,680
the Linux Care bootable business card.

226
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,600
The idea was that you could keep it in your pocket and then rescue a system with it.

227
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:10,460
And then, Phinix, released in 2000, F-I-N-N-I-X, were released before Knoppix and is still

228
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,460
in production.

229
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,120
Yeah, I'm running it right now in a VM.

230
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
How about that?

231
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Wes is on...

232
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,120
It supports UEFI, man.

233
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Really?

234
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
Yeah.

235
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,840
It works with Ventoy just fine.

236
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,900
Oh, wow.

237
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,760
So Phinix 123 was released last year, I think it was.

238
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,000
I think that it released about a year old.

239
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,120
Yeah, it looks like it.

240
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,480
And they're on Discord, they're on Twitter, they're on GitHub.

241
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,680
They have an updated website.

242
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,400
Yeah, they've got docs over on GitHub.

243
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,760
I mean, you don't get a graphical environment, you just get like a root shell.

244
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,200
But if you want something simple...

245
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,920
They're sponsored by Linode.

246
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,560
How amazing is that?

247
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
It's really great.

248
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
I don't know.

249
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Did either...

250
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
I know, Wes, you're running it right now.

251
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
I didn't get a chance to run it.

252
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
I don't know.

253
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Brent, I don't know if you had a chance to try it.

254
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,560
I did.

255
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,640
I was going to do the West route and just run it in a VM, but I thought that was disingenuous.

256
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,840
So I totally, I didn't burn it to a CD, but I did put it on a USB drive and ran it on

257
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,440
some bare metal and it's tiny, which is lovely because it was fast for me to download, but

258
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,320
also fast for me to write it to a USB drive and it booted super fast and it was surprisingly

259
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
modern.

260
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,760
It had notes about ZFS, like if you need to work with ZFS disks, run the following beforehand

261
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,580
and it gave you a nice command.

262
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,780
It was super friendly for like a command line only troubleshooting OS.

263
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,840
So I was nicely impressed actually, I would say.

264
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Yeah.

265
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,680
There's something kind of great about a distribution that's been around since the early two thousands

266
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,920
and they're still doing a release.

267
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,800
They're still trying to engage with community.

268
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,400
They're on social media.

269
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
They're still doing releases.

270
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,920
Their last release was in September of 2021.

271
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,000
Hey, that's pretty recent.

272
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah.

273
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Really for something that's been around as long as they have.

274
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,360
I mean, I'm on too, come on.

275
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
It's really neat to see that.

276
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,000
I was pleasantly surprised, I suppose, is the phrase I'm looking for.

277
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,640
I feel like it says a lot too about some of the stuff we like about the Linux ecosystem.

278
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
Okay.

279
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Sometimes it means things feel stale or, you know, old school, but it also means that the

280
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,960
same thing has been able to preserve.

281
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
Sure.

282
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,340
You got to catch up on stuff, system D, things like that come around, but mostly just stays

283
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,340
the same.

284
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,340
It keeps working.

285
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,360
It keeps the same environment and a live environment that gives you a root shell to try to recover

286
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,100
your system is still something that's really useful today.

287
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,160
So then the real king of live CDs came out.

288
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,840
The one that basically became the Kleenex of live CDs, Knopix, a Debian based Linux

289
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,180
distribution that was released in 2003.

290
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,640
And they really nailed the timing on this because that was right around when broadband

291
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,680
was getting pretty widespread in the US.

292
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,080
So you could actually pull down these ISO images.

293
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,080
That was a new era right there.

294
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,820
That really landed at the right time.

295
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,040
It was named after Claus Knopper, who had like an IT business where this was a useful

296
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,320
tool for him.

297
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,120
And the first public release was actually in 2000, but I guess like the 1.0 that everybody

298
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,200
used was considered 2003.

299
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,040
The history was a little muddled there, but it looks like there was a range of betas that

300
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,720
had been in there and then a final release.

301
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,120
But what was so cool about Knopix was that it had this awesome wicked advanced hardware

302
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,600
detection system.

303
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,300
And this was back in an era where you had to pick if your kernel was going to support

304
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,120
multiple kernels or a single kernel.

305
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,080
And Knopix was problem solving all of that.

306
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,500
It did exhaustive hardware detection.

307
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,620
And then on top of that, if your system was low on memory, it was smart enough to switch

308
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,840
between a KDE desktop or like FWM just automatically.

309
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,320
You could also do things like load it into RAM and all that kind of stuff.

310
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,720
It truly has like a special place in my memory because it was the one that took off like

311
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
wildfire.

312
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,640
And it just became the live CD that everybody used to try a system out.

313
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,960
You could throw a Knopix on a CD, boot up a Windows box and try something out in demo.

314
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,160
This is something I did just right in front of a client.

315
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,720
And I got like the Windows system.

316
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
It was their proxy server.

317
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,680
I got it completely replaced on Knopix as a demo in like a couple of hours and didn't

318
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,160
have to reload their Windows system.

319
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,040
And they were just blown away by all of that.

320
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,540
It changed the way people viewed operating systems and what you could do with them.

321
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,480
But in a lot of ways, it's still something that people are catching up to.

322
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,760
It strikes me as maybe an extension of what we love about using the command line on Linux

323
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,280
is it presents this very immediate, interactive sort of invitation to play with the system

324
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,280
where you're just like, oh, I can do anything here.

325
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,840
I can explore and Linux especially like exposes all these things and a live environment is,

326
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,400
you know, if you think about like a Windows installation or especially like a Mac OS experience,

327
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,600
it's very tied to a particular thing.

328
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,680
Setting it up as a very niche activity, exploring any of its internals or the environment that's

329
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,960
not locked to, you know, you probably bought a computer and it came with the software.

330
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,080
But a live environment is just like, hey, check this out.

331
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Play with me.

332
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
You don't have to commit to anything.

333
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,080
You can try out a whole new world and you reboot and it's all gone.

334
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,640
Yeah, I gave Knopix a spin too.

335
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:04,680
But one thing that I found was a stack of these DVDs that you mentioned, Chris, and

336
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,300
I sent you guys a photo of it.

337
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:14,880
And so along with my, you know, Ubuntu 12.04 and Mint 10 DVDs, I found a Knopix 6 CD and

338
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,400
Sharpied on it said 2009.

339
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:23,920
So it's pretty darn old and lucky for me, I was burning some like local DVDs over Christmas

340
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,640
and so I had my drive handy.

341
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,920
So I actually ended up booting off one of these CDs and do you remember the sound it

342
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,320
makes when you're booting off one of these?

343
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
It was so nostalgic.

344
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,120
You mean the drive?

345
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,140
The drive just kind of working away and, you know, every once in a while some text would

346
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,580
come up on your screen and let you know that things were happening.

347
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:47,360
It was, yeah, I just got a giant smile from just that like auditory experience of booting

348
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
this thing.

349
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
It was lovely.

350
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Yeah, it really is funny because I have a machine right now that I'm using again and

351
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,440
you know this Brent, it has a floppy drive and so to hear that floppy drive get accessed

352
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
from time to time.

353
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Yeah.

354
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
It's very nostalgic sounding.

355
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,660
What was your impression, though, of the overall Knopix experience?

356
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,120
Is it starting to feel kind of old?

357
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
Did it hold up?

358
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,920
Well, that's why I wanted to run both this CD version that I found, you know, buried

359
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,080
away in my stuff, but I also ran the newest version that just came out, it looks like

360
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,220
a few days ago, January 25th, and there was a big contrast, actually.

361
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,440
The old one, obviously, it was running Compiz and stuff, so it had OpenOffice installed

362
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:30,640
and Iceweasel and so it felt kind of aged, but the new Knopix I was pleasantly surprised

363
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
by.

364
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
It felt modern.

365
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,640
I mean, they had some, still had some wonderful ASCII art when it booted up, which was nice.

366
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,240
Yeah, really, a nice little terminal experience there.

367
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Yeah.

368
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,680
It also had a little audio byte that said, initiating startup sequence, which I thought

369
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
was funny.

370
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
That's still in there?

371
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
You're kidding me.

372
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,080
It was a different era when we like wanted sound effects from our systems.

373
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Yeah.

374
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,460
Yeah, I used to like have like little Star Trek sounds for all the different things my

375
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,460
computer did.

376
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,080
That was a horrible idea.

377
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,800
Another kind of dated feel that I thought you guys would enjoy was I noticed when I

378
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:08,840
closed an app in the modern Knopix 9.1 that it still had that like window squiggle fade

379
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,480
action going on.

380
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Wow.

381
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
The classics.

382
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,800
That's great.

383
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:20,440
But then I started digging into the menu and found a bunch of really modern, cool, fun

384
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,840
things to play with.

385
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,480
Like for example, the first thing I saw was it had KD Connect.

386
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,600
So I thought, okay, it's, you know, within the last five years, there's some software

387
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
in there.

388
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,760
And Chris, you'll like this, it had the Electrum Bitcoin wallet listed just by default, you

389
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,760
know, it was installed by default.

390
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
That's kind of random.

391
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
Yeah, I know.

392
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,440
It had Tor browsers and Tor proxy was ready at your fingertips.

393
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,840
It had a DAW simulator on there.

394
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:49,680
But it also had a bunch of options to restart Knopix, either in Docker or a Chirrut or to

395
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,680
run it in KVM.

396
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:57,760
It had a bunch of these like fun little, I guess, scripts to just sort of get you interested,

397
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,760
which I really enjoyed.

398
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,680
Yeah, I mean, it comes from such a different, it's like the middle era now where you can

399
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,240
get the whole 4.3 gig DVD version, which it's that era of, well, you might not have a network

400
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
connection, right?

401
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,600
Or you have one sometimes, and so you want to download the whole world.

402
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,680
So you just get all kinds of different utilities baked in by default.

403
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,100
Yeah, I agree to like the chat rooms talking about how Knopix to RAM give you like the

404
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,000
most amazing performing computer of your time, right?

405
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,560
Because you went from running off of a CD to running on a RAM.

406
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,440
They even have a script still that lets you package up a mini system.

407
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,280
It's got just LXDE and the kernel and like a bare set of sort of like it's got Chromium

408
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,000
and a few rescue utilities, but it fits on a 700 megabyte CD, the modern version.

409
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,020
Yeah, I mean, I would be down with running from a RAM disk all the time.

410
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,920
That feels like that'd be a fun project is create a system that syncs your stuff to a

411
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,440
disk and then it boots into a RAM disk all the time.

412
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,560
Yeah, I mean, you could use snapshots.

413
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,680
I hear one of the servers has a lot of RAM for you to play with.

414
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,600
So I want to hear stories about, you know, live sessions saving your butt.

415
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,480
So Mumble Room, if you've got stories about using a live CD or a live USB session to rescue

416
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,040
data or somebody's computer or your own computer, start thinking about it now.

417
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,040
But before we get to that, I wanted to share something that was really special for me.

418
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,600
And this was in the early 2000s, around 2003, 2004.

419
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,260
There was a project that built on top of Knopix and man, this was awesome for a geek who just

420
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,840
got himself like a cluster of Linux systems, like a whole bunch of them, you know, like

421
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,880
a hundred Linux servers.

422
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:37,680
There was this remix called Cluster Knopix, and it was exactly what it sounds.

423
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,960
It used OpenMozix, which had a special kernel, and you could boot up one of them.

424
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,200
You just boot up this Cluster Knopix and you'd say you're the server.

425
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,360
And then it would fire up a DHCP server and a TFTP server, and then you'd boot the other

426
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,080
systems with Cluster Knopix and say you're a client, and they would use TFTP and DHCP

427
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,600
and network boot to run Linux terminal services to boot up a cluster system that was all loaded

428
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,960
off of one centralized system, and then they would share the processes load.

429
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,480
So you could do builds across all of the systems, and they would just be one, the way the system

430
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,320
looked at it, because that's the way the kernel patch worked, is it was all one process space

431
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,800
across all of the systems.

432
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,640
It was so rad, and it all used Linux terminal services project, so you could essentially

433
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,040
have all of the systems share in the resources, and you could also use it as a desktop environment,

434
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,280
and you'd have like this massive computer behind you.

435
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,480
It was the neatest thing, and I really don't know if anything like that exists anymore,

436
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,320
and it really was a lot of fun to play with, and if you want to get nostalgic, I do actually

437
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:53,000
have a link to an archived version of the ISO in the show notes, because why not?

438
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,320
Why not go back in time and play around with it?

439
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,880
It's pretty fun.

440
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,600
Linode.com slash unplugged.

441
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,920
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support the

442
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
show.

443
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,640
Linode has been our partner since we have gone independent, and they've been around

444
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,240
since 2003, one of the very first companies in cloud computing, and now over 18 years

445
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,880
later they're dedicated to offering the best, and they are independent, and they remain

446
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,960
the largest open cloud provider in the world, with 11 global data centers serving nearly

447
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
a million customers.

448
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,360
You know, we were doing some research for today's episode, looking at some of the classics

449
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,060
in live CDs, and Linode's name came up several times.

450
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,500
They have been such a huge supporter in the community for so long.

451
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,040
It's kind of how I found them.

452
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,640
I noticed, you know, there's a couple of events, and it was definitely the Texas Linux Fest

453
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,000
one, where a couple of the booth vendors just weren't taking the event very seriously, but

454
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,520
you could see the Linode staff was there, they had their game faces on, and they were

455
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,600
genuinely enjoying interacting with the community.

456
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,280
And I wasn't in the market at that time, but I thought, I'm going to remember that, and

457
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
I did.

458
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:10,600
And when it came time for us to build JB 3.0, and I needed really good, fast infrastructure,

459
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,320
and I wanted the best customer support in the world, and I wanted a company who truly

460
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,040
gets Linux, well, it was obvious then, I went with Linode.

461
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,660
I went because they have the best in virtualized cloud computing, 30-50% cheaper than the major

462
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,640
hyperscalers that want to lock you into their crazy, complicated platforms, and they have

463
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,800
a bunch of great extra services in there that we've integrated in with our infrastructure.

464
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,480
I mention the S3 compatible object storage all the time, because it's just so great,

465
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,380
but there's small things that we take for granted, like the super fast networking between

466
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,040
the data centers means that even if a server isn't in the same data center as one of our

467
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,940
object storage, it doesn't matter.

468
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,340
The connectivity is so great, because Linode is their own ISP, and they have a bunch of

469
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,000
one-click applications if you want to just switch over from a proprietary stack that

470
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,680
you've been paying some crazy service to, to maybe a Linode stack, like replace Zoom,

471
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,000
or go to Nextcloud.

472
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,320
I also just got a note from a listener who's using AdGuard centralized on Linode for his

473
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,860
mobile devices and his home.

474
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,580
That kind of stuff is brilliant, and when you get $100, you can really try this kind

475
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,640
of stuff out, and it's a great way to support this podcast.

476
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,120
Keeps us going, keeps us independent, and it lets you get some real value out of Linode.

477
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,760
That's a great opportunity.

478
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,600
Linode.com slash unplugged.

479
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,960
Go there, get that $100 in 60-day credit, and you support the show.

480
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,880
Linode.com slash unplugged.

481
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,960
Well, besides just playing around and trying out a new Linux distro, live environments

482
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,880
can be pretty essential for rescue and recovery.

483
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,440
I think we've all been there.

484
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,360
I think it might be story time.

485
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,320
Let's turn to our chat room, Kectogen.

486
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
What's your story?

487
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,840
So I just did like, you know, some massive upgrade on my Gen 2 system, genius idea.

488
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,920
So one of the kernel modules that was necessary for the system to boot, I didn't look through

489
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,720
it properly, and I boot up, and it doesn't load the video driver.

490
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,480
So I was able to load up, you know, my live USB.

491
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:09,920
I loaded my live USB at short end, you know, install the alternative to the driver or whatever,

492
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,520
do something, and then it boots.

493
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,960
It saved my entire Gen 2 install and many hours of compiling time.

494
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,000
That's always great, you know, like save yourself from an update going wrong.

495
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,180
Minimac, it sounds like you helped someone else that was worried about maybe losing data.

496
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
What happened?

497
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,480
Well, I was at the dentist.

498
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,340
It was like two or three years ago, and she was so scared.

499
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,720
She was really scared because in the morning, the computer did not boot up and she was scared

500
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
of losing data and everything.

501
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,840
So I said, well, can I just boot a Linux installation just to check if the hard drive is okay?

502
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,600
Normal, normal question, yeah.

503
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:53,320
So I booted up an Ubuntu drive that I always have on my key, and then I was in fact able

504
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,600
to tell her that the hard drive was okay and that it was just probably the Windows boot

505
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,360
system that was corrupted.

506
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,200
And she was so happy.

507
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:08,640
I didn't have to pay the bill, and they called a PC doctor to get Windows back running.

508
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,840
Sometimes that helps having a USB key just with you.

509
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,160
Yeah, saving someone's peace of mind in that situation, but it sounds like you were helping

510
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,040
someone after a Windows install went sideways.

511
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
I've been there.

512
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
I've done that.

513
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
Yeah.

514
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:27,160
So I've seen Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE.

515
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,360
I even saw a Windows Server 2000 install.

516
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,840
Why do they always get corrupted during one of those big service packs?

517
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,600
It's like good enough.

518
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,040
Something went wrong, rolling back, installing again, something went wrong.

519
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,360
And suddenly they're like, okay, I have to turn off the computer.

520
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,200
Now it won't start anymore at all.

521
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,520
The Windows bootloader is just the most fragile thing.

522
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,780
You change one little thing and nope, it's just going to blue screen on you.

523
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,280
It feels like they're touching too many things during those processes.

524
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,840
Those PCD files, it's no good.

525
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,640
Just a lot going on there, a lot.

526
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,560
Morgan, you've done this move as well, where you have a system, you're migrating, you don't

527
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,880
have access to the files, you got to get file permissions changed.

528
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
What happened?

529
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,080
Well, moving this cluster and realized after we shut it all down that we hadn't put SSH

530
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,520
keys or anything on it.

531
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,340
And so when we get to the data center, we plug it all in and now we have to configure

532
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,820
its network so it can reach out back to the owner.

533
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,560
So I just threw on, I think it was Fedora Live or something and just popped root, changed

534
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,480
password and rocked the races.

535
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,600
Yeah, it is great for that too.

536
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,520
There's definitely been systems that I've borked that I've saved, or partitions that

537
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,320
I've mounted and got the data off of when the OS has gone sideways.

538
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,200
It's also just been always handy to have a live CD around.

539
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,240
I don't dual boot that often, or now it's easy to have multiple hard drives or set things

540
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
up.

541
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,560
But on one hard drive with multiple partitions, and if you get Windows installed second, for

542
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,880
whatever reason, maybe you already got, it's just always going to overwrite that bootloader

543
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,440
and having a live CD laying around that you could just jump in, reinstall grub or boot

544
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,400
into an existing system to do that, very handy.

545
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:12,000
I don't want to go into detail for reasons that will become obvious, but I had this client

546
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,760
and he was a lawyer and he paid top dollar to have me come out and save his XP system

547
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,440
over and over and over again.

548
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,000
And this went on for a few years.

549
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,840
I think he got a new computer at one point because it got so messed up with malware and

550
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,840
he was really a big email guy.

551
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,640
He did everything through email and Outlook kept getting screwed up for him.

552
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,680
And I think he ended up getting a really super high end HP workstation with a RAID 0 setup

553
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,040
with Windows Vista at the time.

554
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,560
And then a week or two later, it was just loaded up with malware again and there I was.

555
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,720
I was out there cleaning it up and fixing it up.

556
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,880
Did you have the right number of browser toolbars?

557
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
Oh yeah.

558
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
You need those.

559
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,020
So something I don't know if people appreciate as much now, but back in the day, you'd basically

560
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,680
just get owned if you went on the internet with Internet Explorer.

561
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,200
And that's what they would do, right, because they had these ActiveX applications that they

562
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,520
used for like filling out legal paperwork.

563
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,120
And so they were a shop, the User Internet Explorer, and he would go on the internet

564
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,240
in the evenings and entertain himself.

565
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,800
And then he would get his machine loaded up with crap and then they'd have me come out

566
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,100
about almost once a week at one point to clean his system up.

567
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,600
And then all of a sudden it stopped happening.

568
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,040
And I was like, huh, this is great.

569
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,320
Maybe he finally stopped.

570
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
Maybe he's just going home.

571
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
I don't know.

572
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,600
He's just got a computer at home, quit working late at the office.

573
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,360
I don't know.

574
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,760
Except for one week when I came in and I walked into his office and it was booted into a live

575
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
Ubuntu session.

576
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:47,080
He figured out that he could boot into a live session and contain the damage, I suppose.

577
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,760
And that's when it really struck me like, oh, yeah, I guess there's everyday use cases

578
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,960
for this kind of stuff.

579
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,340
I heard of people used it for like paranoid banking and back in the day, like people only

580
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,480
manage their Bitcoin like a live session.

581
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Yeah, right.

582
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,320
I mean, details is still a useful thing today.

583
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Yeah.

584
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Yeah.

585
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,320
But I was like, oh, well, OK, all right, that works because I was getting really sick and

586
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,100
tired of cleaning his system up because it'd always be right in the middle of some kind

587
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,320
of emergency where he had something he had to do right away.

588
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
Big case, you know, needed access.

589
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,600
I'm like, get off my I didn't break your system.

590
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,520
I didn't do this.

591
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,800
You know, like the least you could do is cover your tracks.

592
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,880
Gosh, it's just, you know, one of those things.

593
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,840
So live sessions ended up being really a useful thing, even for everyday folk.

594
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,700
I won't go into more detail than that for obvious reasons.

595
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,180
Now we haven't heard Brent's story yet.

596
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:37,160
So Brent, stay a while and listen, you ever had a live session save your bacon all the

597
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
time?

598
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,720
I will say to the point where I always travel with one and I encourage everyone, friends

599
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,440
and family who I support to also travel with one to just tuck it away somewhere.

600
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
Forget about it.

601
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,320
But if you're traveling somewhere, that's usually when things are going to break.

602
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,360
But the one time that comes to mind that really helped was my mother has a Lenovo Yoga.

603
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,360
It's a 710.

604
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,080
And that'll become a little bit interesting in a bit.

605
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,480
She ran into an Intel microcode bug.

606
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,800
And it took me a little while to figure it out.

607
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,320
But she got to a point where it was like a no boot situation.

608
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,800
And so of course, live USB is the way to do it.

609
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,800
But it took me a few hours to kind of like really get a handle on what was going on and

610
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,800
do a bunch of research.

611
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,840
But the biggest challenge, and this will be hopefully a trick that someone can use.

612
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,560
The biggest challenge with her laptop is it only has one USB port.

613
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Oh, yikes.

614
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,440
Yeah, I've run into a few systems like this.

615
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,080
And it's fine because you can boot into your live USB drive.

616
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,920
But then I always love to do a full backup before I change anything, especially having

617
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,160
to do with kernels and things like that.

618
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,920
So how do you do that if you can't, you know, plug in another drive?

619
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,960
It can also be tricky if you might need, say, you know, if the live environment doesn't

620
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,920
have the right firmware or drivers, and so you don't have, you know, you might need to

621
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:53,720
use the USB for if you can't get access to a built in mouse or keyboard or something.

622
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,240
Yeah, so nice trick that I learned was to simply change the kernel parameters and add

623
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
to RAM.

624
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,440
And I think this might work with all Debian based live disks.

625
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,960
I don't know that for sure.

626
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,160
But that, you know, Chris alluded to it earlier that just throws everything in RAM, you can

627
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,760
unplug the USB, that was such a help in this particular case, because then I was able to

628
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,200
do backups and do a bunch of other stuff.

629
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:23,280
But eventually, led to writing a bug report to Ubuntu for this Intel microcode.

630
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,680
And it was like, I think only three other people had this strange bug with this particular

631
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,580
processor on this particular yoga.

632
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,520
So it was a weird situation, but it totally, you know, live USBs to the rescue again.

633
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Save the day.

634
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,560
Yeah, that, that two RAM trick is pretty killer.

635
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
So great.

636
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,520
You know, you can do some fancy stuff with Ventoy to do that too.

637
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,880
But yeah, as you say, with a lot of Debian based ISOs, like it's just built in, it's

638
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,640
there in the init RAM FS and super handy.

639
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,040
Either of you guys ever try to build your own, like, personal live USB or live CD?

640
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,600
Did you ever mess with any of that kind of stuff?

641
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,960
Yeah, I was building my own little Arch images for a while.

642
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
Really?

643
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
That was fun.

644
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Yeah, Arch ISO, you know, makes it, it makes it pretty easy.

645
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,120
And then you can kind of customize things, build in your environment.

646
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,040
I was, I was especially playing with that as I was exploring, just booting more stuff

647
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,840
to RAM or two RAM environments, and then you could customize the init RAM FS that you bake

648
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
in there.

649
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,840
So it does that.

650
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,960
You know, I was just realizing all of my OG Bitcoin mining I did that I should have held

651
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,400
on to now that I look back, all of that was like custom live sessions and stuff like that.

652
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,920
You know, that I just boot up a machine that was a studio computer that was idle, not doing

653
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,240
anything and then I would have it run that.

654
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,920
And that would just work, you know, and then I would boot back into its regular work OS.

655
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,400
You know, Byte was also bringing up here that you can also have live, live CDs that have

656
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,600
persistence too, like it's still, you know, it doesn't need to take over your computer,

657
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,880
but you with USB drives, at least you can still have that kind of environment where

658
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,400
you don't have to throw everything away.

659
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,360
Well, you see, you have that really super speedy little nano USB thumb drive thing that

660
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
you like.

661
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
What's it called?

662
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
It's got some ridiculous name.

663
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
Oh, supersonic rage two.

664
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
Yeah, yeah.

665
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,920
That's what you want in your USB.

666
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,760
I mean, you could almost see like you load everything to RAM and then right as you're

667
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,640
shutting down or whatever, it saves to that supersonic rage speed thing.

668
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,960
And then that's your like persistent storage.

669
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,480
I was running Windows 11 off here.

670
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,520
It was super slow, but you know, it did work.

671
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,000
Yeah, but I want to run it from RAM.

672
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
What do you got?

673
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,800
Don't you have like 64 gigs or something?

674
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,800
It's 32 gigs in here.

675
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Yeah.

676
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
Okay.

677
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
You can still make it work though.

678
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Yeah, yeah.

679
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
You totally could.

680
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,120
I feel like that's something we should work on is like, wouldn't that make Air Master

681
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
great?

682
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
I feel like that'd be great.

683
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
Air Master should be running from RAM.

684
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
You're right.

685
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,680
And that way we can install whatever crap we might want.

686
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Mm hmm.

687
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
OBS.

688
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
When you're running from RAM.

689
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,360
You know, recklessly doing updates right before the show.

690
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
Yeah.

691
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,360
Not a big deal.

692
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,360
Not a big deal, right?

693
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,360
Hmm.

694
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,800
You know, that's what kind of live CDs to me also highlight is that the Linux boot process,

695
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,820
whether it's the, you know, the old bio style UEFI versions these days, whether it's all

696
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,560
baked into one big kernel thing or you have a separate RAMFS, whatever.

697
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
It's so flexible.

698
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,100
Like, and you can, you can even just drop to a shell in your inner RAMFS and change

699
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,480
mount points and move things around and move stuff to RAM if you want.

700
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,920
Like it, it's just such a fun world that you can really customize pretty easily.

701
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,720
And there's a lot of scripts these days to make it pretty simple.

702
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,800
It's just so uniquely Linux.

703
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,360
You can get like a live Mac rescue environment or whatever, but you can really have these

704
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,440
custom Linux environments and it's something that we've kind of just completely forgotten

705
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,440
is so special, but it really is a superpower.

706
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,120
It doesn't have to be a stripped down environment.

707
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,480
You can have it as fat as you want as long as you got the, you know, USB space for it.

708
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Go for it.

709
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,000
I mean, I was downloading some SOOS image that was like five gigs the other night.

710
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,760
So that's pretty big.

711
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Pretty big.

712
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,600
And it's, it's funny because we were talking, we got down this path just by talking about

713
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,960
different ways to install Linux and then sort of a tangential conversation.

714
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,320
We were talking about sort of big moments in Linux's history.

715
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,080
And as a, as kind of a side tangent, I looked up a few articles that were written that covered

716
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,120
like massive, massive moments in Linux's history.

717
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,600
And I didn't see any of them that listed live, live CDs and live sessions.

718
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,440
I feel like that's a major oversight because it was such a hack to let you test your hardware

719
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,480
compatibility back during such uncertain times.

720
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,080
It let you before you took a leap, really try it out.

721
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,120
And that really made it possible for so many people to adopt Linux.

722
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,200
And it made it possible for distros to say, look, you can try it first before you, you

723
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
know, before you deploy.

724
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,880
Especially maybe, you know, you're just trying it out and you have a shared, a shared desktop

725
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,280
you're sharing with your family or other members in the household.

726
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,280
And like, you can't, you know, you don't have partition.

727
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,880
You might have a 20 gig partition back in the day or something like you don't have space

728
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,920
to separate things out, let alone do you have the skills to install it.

729
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,920
So yeah, pretty crucial for even getting Linux at all.

730
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,520
And now it's just how we do pretty much everything, you know, when you go to install, it's just

731
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
totally how it is.

732
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,800
And I know what kids these days, they didn't have to walk uphill both ways to install their

733
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,160
Linux like we did.

734
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,160
And that's good.

735
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,160
Yeah.

736
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,840
Now they just use a cloud workstation.

737
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,760
Just a spot of housekeeping this week, cause you know, we got some eating to get to, but

738
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,040
I do want to thank our members at unpluggedcore.com.

739
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,120
You guys help us keep this show going, especially when it's just like a single sponsor show.

740
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,320
Like you're, you're what's keeping us on the road right now.

741
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
Thank you.

742
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,440
And so as a thank you, we have two feeds, an ad free feed, totally ad free now, or the

743
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,200
live feed that has everything we did on the pre and post show, all our screw ups, you

744
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,240
know, when West starts cursing, that's all in there now.

745
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
Sorry.

746
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
You got to get fired up.

747
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,180
So it kind of depends on what you want something longer or do you want something with all the

748
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:30,680
Joe's editing techniques and fine touches, you know, that Joe Rez special it's your choice.

749
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,040
You get a tighter show that's the Joe Rez special with no ads, or you get the long one

750
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,960
where we screw up, we talk over each other, West is cursing, but it's also like two shows

751
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
in one.

752
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,760
It's a whole lot of other stuff going on.

753
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,400
That's all available for our members.

754
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,960
And also anyone who supports the whole network at Jupiter.party, if you want to support more

755
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,560
than a couple of shows, that's probably the way to go Jupiter.party plus you got to type

756
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
in that fun domain.

757
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
Yeah, that's true.

758
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
That's true.

759
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,000
Shout out to those of you who have been sending us boosts with the value for value payment

760
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,360
systems in the new podcast apps, if you don't know what I'm talking about, well, you got

761
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,520
to go check out newpodcastapps.com because we're getting live messages from folks out

762
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,580
there that are listening to the show as they go.

763
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,640
It's pretty great.

764
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,160
See somebody send in a message.

765
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,280
We got a boost the other day because they were streaming us sats as they listen, but

766
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,440
Linux action news was kind of short.

767
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,720
So they sent us an extra boost to make all that.

768
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,600
Isn't that great?

769
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
It's pretty cool.

770
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,480
It's a it's a I think it's gonna be a revolution one day we shall see.

771
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,400
And last but not least, we'd love to have you join us.

772
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,360
We do this show on a Sunday, set a little time aside and come hang out.

773
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,080
Well since last week's mailbag was lost, we found it again and it was extra full.

774
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,040
So this week, we're going to touch on a little bit of some arch feedback.

775
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,840
Carrie writes, I wanted to offer up an alternative to your hypothesis that Linux gaming was driving

776
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
arch adoption.

777
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,400
I'm not a gamer, but I have been finding myself gravitating to Manjaro and Garuda.

778
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,340
I've been a Windows, Mac OS and iOS user for a long time and I've always been an early

779
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:06,000
adopter of new updates, I jump at a chance for new releases to have fun playing with

780
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
new features.

781
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,680
I even like to beta test even though I'm not super technical.

782
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,400
Just like your thoughts in Linux Unplugged 4.22, I feel that technology should be fun.

783
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,460
I purchased a framework laptop last year and ran Linux exclusively on it.

784
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,880
The only distros that worked in the beginning were the bleeding edge distros that adopted

785
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,320
the latest kernel.

786
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:33,280
This left Fedora 35 and Arch as the easiest to install solutions for quite a while.

787
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,160
And only recently do distros like Pop OS work seamlessly, mostly due to driver support issues.

788
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,960
Waiting for a stable release in the Ubuntu world just isn't feasible.

789
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,480
Arch's rolling release solves the new hardware issues and allows us to play with new features.

790
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,360
The tried and true distros like Ubuntu are slow to release updates to the kernel and

791
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,680
desktop environment and frankly just aren't that fun, although I am happily using them

792
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,280
for my server's VMs because of the great documentation, support and stability.

793
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,240
I think that echoes a sentiment that I hear more and more when I talk to people in the

794
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,080
real world.

795
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,280
And I don't know what that necessarily means for the Ubuntu.

796
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,360
I think this is an issue we've been kind of circling around delicately because we don't

797
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,000
want to sound like we're dogging on Ubuntu.

798
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,840
But there sure seems to be a trend line here that we're seeing from our audience and we're

799
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
starting to see from data.

800
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,120
And that makes me kind of uncomfortable actually.

801
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:28,520
There's still a lot of momentum and there's still many folks who are maybe not Linux users

802
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,880
but not following it as closely as we do.

803
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,920
Let's say that Ubuntu is maybe still sort of a default, like, oh, what's that latest

804
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Ubuntu release?

805
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
I'll give that a go.

806
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,180
But if you're really following what's latest, you're interested in trying out new versions

807
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,880
of software, new kernels, yeah, it's probably not what you're gravitating to.

808
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,240
So I wonder too, like, we could be having a couple of trends, right?

809
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,640
Like people that adopted Ubuntu a while ago are maybe just kind of looking for something

810
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
else.

811
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,120
At the same time, we're kind of at the peak age between LTS releases.

812
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,880
We're just at the dawn before the next LTS where it's kind of going to be new again.

813
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,120
And maybe get that little nice, you know, first six months, right, right.

814
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,520
But I kind of agree, like, I also find myself gravitating towards Arch and Fedora for that

815
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,560
fresh hardware stack.

816
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,800
And also, legitimately, there is really good innovation and improvements landing in upstream

817
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Linux kernels.

818
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,640
And I want that on my machine.

819
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,840
And I've always kind of been on the fence on that.

820
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,640
But in the last year or so, it's essentially been, if you look at the last few kernel releases

821
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,720
for the last, I don't know, six months to a year, there's like at least one, often five

822
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,680
things that are landing in the kernel that I'm like, oh, that's great.

823
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,620
I've been waiting for that for years.

824
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,840
And so it's just such a good time to have a fresh version of the kernel.

825
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,640
Like, there are seasons where the kernel kind of slows down a little bit, but we are not

826
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,160
in one of those seasons right now.

827
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,600
And you don't really need to rely, I think there's also sort of a, oh, Ubuntu, you know,

828
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
it's going to make things really easy.

829
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
It's just going to work.

830
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
It's going to be rock solid.

831
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
It'll work on my hardware.

832
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
They've got things out.

833
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
It's very well tested.

834
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
And that's all still true.

835
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,840
But I mean, Fedora has come a huge way.

836
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,600
There's easy to use Arch setups for you.

837
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,940
Of course, there's various options from SUSE, like, there's just a lot of things that can

838
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,240
work that have newer options, you know, you're not stuck.

839
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,240
Those have all gotten better.

840
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,560
I mean, I think it is worth mentioning, because we all know this, but we haven't said it out

841
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,400
loud is there are use cases for having a kernel version that doesn't change.

842
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,220
Like there, you know, we've had hardware in the past that has a driver for a specific

843
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,360
version of the kernel.

844
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
And you're sticking to that.

845
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,920
Like there are use cases for having a system that doesn't have a bunch of updates.

846
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,800
Maybe you've got ZFS involved.

847
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,600
Speaking of ZFS, I think Kristen has the opposite end of this one.

848
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,840
She says, I was just listening to the Linux Unblogged 4.42.

849
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,160
And I found a downside of newer kernels on Ubuntu based distros.

850
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,160
I run Pop!

851
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,160
OS 2004.

852
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,080
And a couple weeks ago, I tried to mess around with that ZFS, but it didn't work.

853
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:58,180
Turns out there's a problem because the kernel is new, but the ZFS modules weren't updated

854
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,480
to match.

855
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,240
Linked is a Reddit thread that might be interesting.

856
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:07,000
Of course, that Reddit post could all be wrong, she writes, but it seems plausible.

857
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,960
For all I know, the problem could be fixed now.

858
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,800
One of the shows, by the way, best, Kristen McDuffie, former assistant district attorney

859
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,800
of New York City.

860
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
P.S.

861
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,960
I've been messing around with mini computers lately.

862
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,960
They're fun.

863
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,960
What a daredevil.

864
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,000
What do you guys think?

865
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I totally agree.

866
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,320
Mini computers are a lot of fun.

867
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
That's awesome.

868
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
I'm glad that she added that.

869
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,320
Yeah.

870
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,100
Boy, she just really kind of illustrated the point that I just roughly attempted to make.

871
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,960
And that's a great, you know, that really is true.

872
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,440
And I wanted to acknowledge that on the show, too.

873
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,680
It's like, yeah, there are use cases like ZFS or hardware where if you're getting updates

874
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,960
all the time, things are going to break.

875
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,360
And when you're in production, you ain't got no appetites for that.

876
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
Right.

877
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,440
And it may require that you learn about those things.

878
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,440
And not all computer users really have to want to have to care about that kind of thing.

879
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,440
And that's fair.

880
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,160
And the other thing we have is we kind of have the advantage of kind of trending our

881
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,080
systems towards working in this environment, right?

882
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,020
It's not something that we're just now figuring out we want to do.

883
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,160
We know we like these modern components.

884
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,520
And so we've built our systems in a way now for a while.

885
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,520
So they work with that stuff.

886
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,880
We're not trying to take an LTS workflow and use it on a rolling.

887
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Right.

888
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,240
And we're now we're even even like when we look for hardware, we're looking for hardware

889
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
that we know already has kernel support today.

890
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,360
So that way, any kernel we go to in the future is also going to just keep working.

891
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,440
And that's the luxury you have of figuring this out a little bit ago and just now having

892
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,540
years of making those choices kind of pay dividends.

893
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,440
But when you're just kind of getting started, you got to really kind of get your feet underneath

894
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,160
yourself and figure that stuff out.

895
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,160
So we got one last one we wanted to get in before we wrap up the feedback.

896
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,040
You want to take that one, Mr. Payne?

897
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,040
Yeah.

898
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,040
Garrett writes in.

899
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Hi, guys.

900
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,200
I feel a little lost in the woods on the whole SUSE Liberty Linux intrigue.

901
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,120
So we're primarily a red hot shop where I work in academia.

902
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:59,680
And occasionally, I'll have some contact with our regional SUSE representative because,

903
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,560
well, I just love chatting about Linux and yeah, hey, Garrett, we feel you there.

904
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:11,160
Garrett goes on to say, anyway, SUSE's primary goal is, of course, to get you to buy SUSE

905
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,080
the Linux enterprise and maintain a support contract.

906
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:19,960
In organizations like ours, traditionally, you'd be proposing a migration from the fleet

907
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,440
of relboxes to SLE.

908
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,480
I can be a mind blowing task to execute in a tight timeline if you want to avoid a very

909
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,080
expensive contract overlap.

910
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,120
So much so that this could be a blocker to any type of deal actually moving forward.

911
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:40,040
To massage this point a little, according to our rep, they offer rebuilds of Red Hat

912
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:47,240
RPMs and offer a method to migrate your box from rel update repos to SUSE maintained ones.

913
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:51,480
This gives you an opportunity to cut your Red Hat contract, keep your existing rel servers

914
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,160
fed with updates, and allow you to grow into your eventual SLE roadmap.

915
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,200
The idea being that you wouldn't bring up any new Red Hat boxes with SUSE, but new boxes

916
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,680
would be SLE and you'd phase out your Red Hat through an intentional migration of attrition.

917
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,880
I could see SUSE needing to rebrand legally what they build, similar to how CentOS, Racky,

918
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,560
and Alma have to, and that maybe Liberty Linux is that branding result.

919
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,520
Those rel SUSE Liberty Linux boxes could be what Apple was seeing.

920
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,560
Does that seem plausible or am I missing a finer detail to indicate a new skew?

921
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,760
The only thing that kind of would influence my thought process on this is I think we have

922
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,640
to keep in mind that this is essentially a service that SUSE was offering before the

923
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,640
whole Liberty thing.

924
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,080
It's essentially a rebranded package.

925
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,640
And without the distro part of it, I don't really know how it's different.

926
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,360
And it has been kind of hilarious.

927
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,600
Even as of like a couple of days ago, there are outlets that are still reporting this

928
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,620
as a new CentOS clone.

929
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,620
That's embarrassing.

930
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,960
It seems like several people in the media had insider knowledge about this thing getting

931
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,940
worked on, but then they didn't get the updated insider knowledge that it was pivoted to a

932
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,420
different product or that part of it was canceled.

933
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:13,280
And so the initial reports led as a CentOS clone, when in fact it is a service that allows

934
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,320
you, like was just very well articulated here by Garrett, it allows you to manage your SUSE

935
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:24,400
boxes and your rel based boxes all together with one SUSE management system and then eventually

936
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,320
transition to a complete SUSE system.

937
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,800
Carl, sounds like maybe you've got some thoughts on the scope change for Liberty.

938
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Sure.

939
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,960
There was a Twitter thread I was participating in and Richard Brown, Cisrich on Twitter,

940
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,960
he works for SUSE.

941
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,760
I think he used to be on the OpenSUSE board and he clarified that in the past, the old

942
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,720
expanded support offering that was for rel only and it had kind of an expectation that

943
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,320
you would eventually migrate to SLIS.

944
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:55,680
And the new Liberty offering is that it is for rel and CentOS and there's no expectation

945
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,160
you can just keep using it forever.

946
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Oh, interesting.

947
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,800
And that actually seems like a pretty smart move there.

948
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,800
I mean, if this is all it ever is to that, this is probably a decent offering that people

949
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,920
like Garrett, we make a good case, we'll take care, take advantage of.

950
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,920
Seems quite practical.

951
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,560
I still wouldn't rule out a distro shipping one day though.

952
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,880
I mean, I'm hoping here.

953
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,760
It'd be a lot of fun.

954
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:22,560
All right, just a quick pick this week because it's so ridiculous, but my grandpa tells me

955
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,440
all the time that back in his day, Lotus one, two, three on the terminal was the best damn

956
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,440
spreadsheet program around.

957
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:37,720
And so in that spirit, we're going to share SCIM, which is a spreadsheet calculator in

958
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,720
the command line.

959
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,720
And yeah, it's an end curses based SOB and it's kind of beautiful.

960
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,720
There's graphs in here?

961
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,720
What?

962
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,720
Yeah, yeah.

963
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,720
I wonder if this would actually make me tolerate spreadsheets or if it would just make it even

964
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,720
more confusing.

965
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,720
Yeah.

966
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,400
I mean, you could, you could write down all in your various crypto assets in here, keep

967
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,680
track of it, make little charts on the command line.

968
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,680
I love it.

969
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,680
Yeah, that'd be good.

970
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,680
Right now.

971
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,160
They've got well formatted tables with breakdowns.

972
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,340
It's actually not bad, right?

973
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:06,800
Like some genuine hard work has gone into this application.

974
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,960
Like you could really use this on the daily.

975
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,440
It seems to be very much inspired, built in part with VIM.

976
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,720
So you'll have to get used to that, I guess.

977
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,760
You know, finally learn the ice and the hard truth is, is I would probably be able to pick

978
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:24,200
it up pretty quick because I used to, I used to exclusively use VIM as my editor on my

979
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,200
systems.

980
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,280
This thing has XLSX import support.

981
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,280
What?

982
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,280
I know.

983
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,680
You know, if it just had some sort of integration with nano, I'd really be on board.

984
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,360
That'd be pretty great.

985
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,160
So our love blog is getting together on Tuesdays and Sundays.

986
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,160
We have a bunch of it.

987
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:44,280
We have a bunch of like, yeah, we have a bunch of time now, like, well, two, I guess compared

988
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,280
to just one.

989
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,280
That's like a doubling.

990
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,280
Right?

991
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,280
Yes.

992
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,280
That kind of feels like a bunch.

993
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,280
Right?

994
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,280
You see what I'm going with?

995
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,280
200% from, you know, the.

996
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,280
That's what I'm saying.

997
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,720
So if you'd like to know when those things happen, you're gonna have to figure it on

998
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,040
your own because there's no calendar at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

999
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,040
That's not a thing.

1000
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,040
Don't check.

1001
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,320
There's no linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

1002
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
You couldn't put these pieces together.

1003
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,660
It's impossible.

1004
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,840
And we don't talk about it all the time on the live stream on Sundays, which we do every

1005
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,980
single Sunday.

1006
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:12,960
You definitely can't join our telegram group to ask about that.

1007
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,960
Right.

1008
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,160
You can't go to linuxunplug.com slash telegram.

1009
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,760
You can't do that, unfortunately.

1010
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,360
And there's no way to find out about new releases on Twitter, like a Jupiter signal or anything

1011
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,360
like that.

1012
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,720
There's also no method to subscribe to get MP3 files very easily on your.

1013
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,560
We never put up linuxunplug.com slash subscribe.

1014
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,240
We never publish the links at linuxunplug.com slash 443.

1015
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,240
We don't do those things.

1016
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,600
I mean, we would, but we got brats to go eat.

1017
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:37,600
So we're going to go do that.

1018
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,600
That's it, though.

1019
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,560
I'd love to hear when a live session saved your bacon.

1020
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,520
Let us know, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1021
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:45,520
Send it over there.

1022
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,520
Let us know.

1023
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,280
And we got a whole bunch coming up.

1024
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,280
So join us live one of these days and help us title this thing and hang out in our virtual

1025
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,280
lug.

1026
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,280
We do it at jblive.tv.

1027
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,280
We want you there.

1028
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,280
We do.

1029
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,880
But we still appreciate you listening, downloading, becoming a member if you can, or sharing this

1030
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,880
with a friend.

1031
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,680
It's the best way to spread a podcast is word of mouth.

1032
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,760
If you enjoyed this episode, share it with somebody.

1033
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,360
We'd appreciate that very much.

1034
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,360
Thanks so much for joining us.

1035
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,560
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1036
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:53,960
All right, let's go title this thing so we can get to cooking, everybody.

1037
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,960
I'm not ready for that.

1038
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,400
I'm still stuck on this pick because it's got Lua scripting.

1039
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,400
What?

1040
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,400
It's got GNU plot integration.

1041
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,400
Yeah, I knew the GNU plot.

1042
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,400
I didn't know about the Lua scripting.

1043
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,400
I love GNU plot.

1044
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,400
It's just great.

1045
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,400
All right, title time.

1046
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,160
We got to go pick our title.

1047
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,160
JBtitles.

1048
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,680
Everybody out in the living room, get on your phones and go over to JBtitles.com and pick

1049
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,680
a title.

1050
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,680
Come on.

1051
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,680
Put yourself.

1052
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,680
What?

1053
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,680
Is that a thing?

1054
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,680
Is that a thing?

1055
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,680
Not yet.

1056
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,680
Should be though.

1057
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,680
Could be.

1058
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,680
We got every other domain out there.

1059
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,680
Tell you what.

1060
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,680
Tell the registrar quick.

1061
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,840
Here, crack that door open there, Wes, just so we can just crack it open so we can hear

1062
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,840
them.

1063
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,840
Just get a little.

1064
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,840
There we go.

1065
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,840
Yeah.

1066
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,460
All right.

1067
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:34,800
These are all about me getting old.

1068
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,800
What's with that?

1069
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,800
How are all these titles?

1070
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,800
I'm not sure.

1071
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,800
Because you are?

1072
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,800
What the hell is this?

1073
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:40,800
Sorry, Chris.

1074
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,440
Well, you wanted the live stream to keep going, so I had to have content.

1075
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,440
You just became the content.

1076
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,440
Oh, man.

1077
00:50:48,440 --> 00:51:04,560
Oh, man.
