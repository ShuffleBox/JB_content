1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
You got something you want to hide or you just want to be a baller like this is it silk Guardian is an anti-forensic

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,240
LKM kill switch that waits for a change on your USB ports and

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,880
Then wipes your RAM and turns off your computer very much inspired by USB kill

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,400
I made this project because I feel that it could be implemented better than already is so you make it you build it

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,960
Three reasons why this project exists in case the po-po or other thugs come busting in I like that police are the first threat

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,960
You know this guy must be a US citizen

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,440
You don't want someone to retrieve documents from your computer via USB. That's true

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,440
Or installs on my back doors. Yeah, you don't want malware or back doors

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,000
You want to improve the security of your full disk encrypted home computer or server like maybe a Raspberry Pi actually that last one's kind

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,600
Of legit yeah, so there you go if you want to just destroy your machine in one go silk Guardian

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,640
I like that idea doesn't wipe the drive though. It just wipes the RAM, but I'm sure you could

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,160
Customize heck yeah, you could heck yeah, you could I think that I think that could be that could be brilliant

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
This is Linux unplugged episode

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,520
133 for February 23rd

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,520
2016

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,520
2016

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,240
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that might just be swimming in laptops

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,280
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello there Wes. Guess what we got a great show. Yes, we do

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,920
I'm really really looking forward to today's episode a

20
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,780
We're gonna have a chance to talk about something that everybody else in the press is talking about everybody

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,160
But they're getting it all wrong. They're getting it all wrong

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,320
We're gonna talk about the big quote-unquote mint hack the ISO breach

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:53,180
That has been getting a lot of attention since Linux action show on Sunday

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:01,060
Then later on in the show. I am very excited to share my first hands-on impressions with intro airs

25
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,700
Apollo laptop I

26
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,660
West you can attest to this the first thing I do when I see people's I shove it in their hands

27
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,020
Oh, yes, that's right. You didn't even have your bag set down yet

28
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,840
Give me your impressions I have in the

29
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,860
24 hours that I have had this laptop in my possession

30
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,800
I've been going around getting people's opinions asking them what they think I've got my opinions

31
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,980
I've set up my desktop the way. I like it. I'm gonna give you my first thoughts on

32
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,460
Their ultimate Linux laptop, so that's gonna be an interesting comparison from last week's episode

33
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,740
So we're gonna talk about the mint stuff. We also have a whole bunch of follow-ups including some ZFS things that are actually

34
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,120
pretty exciting a little bit of bumpy news for Ubuntu touches new fancy phone and

35
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,980
many other good things including

36
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,860
including some fun news from the community

37
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,020
So why don't we start there let's bring in that community time appropriate greetings virtual log

38
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,860
Okay, so we have a pretty good showing today

39
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,820
And I know some of you already drinking your beers in there

40
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,500
I want to be I want to first I want to welcome Graham because he made me think of this you reminded me Graham from

41
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,800
Linux voice and from a kick Kickstarter project. We're about to cover Graham welcome to Linux unplugged. Thank you very much

42
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,140
Thanks for having me so tell me about the beer you're drinking on the show today. Um it's a it's a local beer

43
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,420
It's from bath. I'm in Wiltshire in the UK and it used to be called barnstormer

44
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,620
Until they were sued by a company in the US who made a cider even with the beer with the same name

45
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,620
So it's now called Barnsley

46
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,300
Yeah, I still call it barnstormer in the pub. You know that is funny

47
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,840
It's pretty that's pretty appropriate because Wes and I are also drinking a local beer from Washington State where we're based out of called whistling

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,740
pig

49
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:52,500
It's a half of Ison. So yeah, I like it. Ours has got a 4.4 or 5.4 percent alcohol by volume

50
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,620
It's kind of avoid the litigation. I guess with that name. Yeah, right

51
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:03,260
They have and it says the Northwest original German style craft burr kind of a confused name. I think yeah

52
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:10,020
That's what it says there, but the Northwest original since 1992 folks. That's like saying you haven't heard

53
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,460
Shakespeare until you've heard in the original Klingon

54
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:19,220
It is but it's not a bad beer Washington to reinvent the traditional German style. Yeah

55
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:27,680
Exactly. So, okay. Well Graham, let's get started with something kind of exciting that you guys have going on because it's really we should give

56
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,380
It some attention right away. It's only got a few days left and it's getting close to the finish line. It's beep beep

57
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,780
Yar, what is this?

58
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:44,860
So, yeah, so we make a magazine we actually crowdfunded at the next magazine and over the last couple of years that we've been doing this

59
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,540
We really wanted to try and experiment with other things we can because we kind of do this on our own

60
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,020
One of the things we always wanted to do was write books for children

61
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,100
I've got kids a couple of us have got kids and I know this has become a bit of a thing now

62
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,540
But we still don't think that anybody's really tackled made computing fun and programming fun. And so we

63
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,020
Kick-started trying to kick-start a project to make a book that hopefully makes programming fun. The book is actually story-driven

64
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,020
It's got pirates and robots in it

65
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,220
and we hope to inadvertently secretly kind of insert bits of

66
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:27,900
programming law in there without the kids actually having to do any programming in the book itself a little brainwashing is never a bad thing I

67
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,140
In fact, I really love the video. I'm gonna play just a minute of it because I believe it's your daughter

68
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:37,980
Here's the super cute and I think the best person to introduce this idea is my eight-year-old daughter Eden

69
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:45,740
This is grace and this is Alan grace and Alan are just like my best friends. They love to learn

70
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,980
They like to push themselves and do cool things and they aren't afraid to try anything new

71
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,500
This is really cool. And I also you know, I remember I was pretty lucky

72
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:02,980
I when I was young ish, I had a book called how computers work and it was did you ever saw these but it was

73
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:09,540
Really well illustrated books that helps you break it down visually and just having something that was sort of approachable

74
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,540
That when I did have a little bit of curiosity

75
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,460
Helped me kind of take it further tips, too

76
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,340
Well, that's it. I I had those books with the source code and you remember they were like in the 80s

77
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,020
That's where you're gonna get it from of course

78
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,820
Was that was that input magazine by any chance I

79
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,180
Had a cool news. I had them as my barcode you could scan in with a barcode reader

80
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,980
That's pretty cool

81
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:43,540
Well, so we got we got just a few days left five days left on the Kickstarter looking for a pledge of total of

82
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,860
28,684 us greenbacks and currently at

83
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,380
16,903 us so if you guys want to check it out go look for bpbr

84
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,300
We'll have a link in the show notes, too

85
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,420
so

86
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,020
Graham anything else we should know about the the effort here

87
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,300
so is this gonna run kind of in long side the same sort of the same production team as Linux voice and sort of

88
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,220
Or since that's sort of like a sub project. How's exactly sort of situated? Well part of part of the money that

89
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,660
We're all really so busy making the magazine part of the money from the kick-starting campaign

90
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,020
But actually go to help us commission out more stuff for the magazine to give us some time to do the book

91
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,540
we're also going to do an interactive part to it so that at the end of each chapter you can actually

92
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,540
With your child if you want to go online and type in bits of code and kind of experiment with the characters in the book

93
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,700
To kind of augment the story in that way

94
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,780
Yeah, the idea is I mean the thing is that print publishing of magazines

95
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,820
It's it's pretty it's a pretty static business and in a way

96
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,940
We're trying to safeguard and kind of look into broaden our horizons a little bit as well. So we thought we'd give it a go

97
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,140
Well, best of luck to you and like you say at the bottom. It's not necessarily just for kids. No

98
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,620
Secretly secretly, it's my fantasy pirates and robots. Yeah, it's a good one

99
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,460
And with a little bit of a software ideology in there. I think it's pretty good

100
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,620
Well, best of luck and hopefully guys go check it out

101
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,720
Thanks. So Graham, you're absolutely welcome to stick around and chat with us during the rest of the show

102
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,380
I had something I wanted to talk about. I saw wimpy on Google Plus saying there's a mutiny afoot

103
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,780
For Ubuntu 1604 and it's it's wimpy now makes news

104
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:27,000
Apparently when he posts on Google Plus because pretty soon news outlets picked it up and covered mutiny the new unity style desktop layout for Ubuntu

105
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:34,700
1604 and then I very quickly noticed wimpy take to g-plus trying to make sure everybody understood it wasn't gonna be mandatory

106
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,300
It was just an option. So what is mutiny wimpy?

107
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:46,020
It's another user interface layout for Ubuntu. Okay, so those of you that been following the project main map may already know that you can

108
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,060
One-click to augment the user interface to look like Windows or Mac OS 10 and

109
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:59,620
Now we've added a look and feel that is a poor facsimile of unity

110
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,580
It's a functional facsimile. Yeah. Yeah, it does. It does work. Yeah

111
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,780
So it has it has the global the global menu and you have the dock down the side

112
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,500
And it kind of looks and works like unity

113
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,700
But really it's there to sort of showcase some of the new components that have been introduced into Ubuntu

114
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,380
Marte which are there for anyone to use in their panels to create a user interface that suits them

115
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,420
So that global menu can be put on any panel anywhere you'd like

116
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:37,820
I don't down the side is just an applet that can go into any panel so it can go top bottom left, right

117
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:42,140
You know, you can align it how you'd like and you can so that whole side panel is an applet

118
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,820
But the panel is a panel and then that the top right the icons are a big happening out there

119
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,140
Yeah, that's that's all in an applet. Okay, the Marte doc applet made by Robin Thompson

120
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,780
He started that about

121
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:02,300
6-9 months ago and I've been talking with him and I'm actually really pleased. He's at he's actually

122
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:10,180
Developing within the Ubuntu Marte team now. So whilst we're talking I can see a telegram group going with the Ubuntu Marte

123
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,740
Developers and they're they're feverishly

124
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:19,500
Working on on new stuff. So yes, it's worked really well and and I like the backdrop as well. Yes

125
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,180
I like that a lot to backdrop from one of the other developers

126
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:29,500
Yes, I like that a lot to backdrop from one of the Google Plus community members some ghost

127
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,900
67 and he's got a good YouTube channel as well with

128
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,540
distro reviews and insights

129
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,700
So I have had some additional time with Ubuntu Mate

130
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:49,160
1510 that shipped on the Apollo and I you know every time I use it every single time there

131
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:56,920
There are just like to this time around it was the fact that VLC was preset up installed as the default audio player

132
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,920
like, you know, it's just

133
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,500
There when I here's the difference for me between Ubuntu Mate and Ubuntu

134
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,680
Legitimately when I'm installing Ubuntu standard 1510 or 1604

135
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,040
It takes me like if I get a machine with Ubuntu 1604 on it

136
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,880
It takes me less time to wipe it and install anti-gross and then from the command line using your word

137
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,000
Install everything I need with one command

138
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,960
It takes me less time to do all of that than it does to set up the Ubuntu installation not the case

139
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,660
with with Ubuntu Mate and it's some of its because of mate tweak Mate tweak and

140
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,720
And you know some of its like the predefined looks that wimpy has or that, you know, the team has put together and

141
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,060
Yeah, it's it is a real feels like a tool

142
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,480
It whatever you want to use it

143
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,100
You just some of the things I just have to do already like for another example is install G

144
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,620
Debye the the graphical G Debye package installer when you download Debs

145
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,920
That's just the best way to install a deb if you want to gooey and it's already set up on a boot to Mate edition

146
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,740
So things like that are always really nice. So 1604

147
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,080
It is looking like a great release

148
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,760
And so I I kind of had a question about this isn't isn't elementary OS also working on a 1604 based

149
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,480
Release and how the hell do you get your hands on something like that? I

150
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,800
Guess there is a way there's instructions for the odd on launchpad to build the Loki ISO

151
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,240
But I think you need to have elementary OS already installed. So if anybody out in the chat room

152
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,560
We're out in the community is up for making me a Loki beta ISO so I could try it out. That would be fun

153
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,200
Yeah, I'm curious to see where they're going to because I haven't checked them out for what I've been thinking a lot about the elementary

154
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:42,120
OS project recently, right and they're just taking over Geary and yeah, they just took over Geary and have Pantheon mail now

155
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,120
they announced that this week and

156
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,120
I think part of it is because my son has

157
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,940
Been using elementary OS for almost a year now and it's really been flawless

158
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:55,240
Wow, and I just sat down and used his computer to set up

159
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:03,180
Some some minecraft mod manager. I can't remember what it's called now and you know, it was just a it's just a clean simple experience

160
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,180
I just I think

161
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,380
I

162
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,380
Don't know. I feel like

163
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,740
Maybe maybe it's worth another look. I've been I've been following on 1604 hotness

164
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,060
Yeah

165
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,860
So if somebody out there want to make me an ISO because they if they have elementary OS installed and follow the instructions

166
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,700
I'd be curious because I don't have elementary

167
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,820
installed speaking of some of our favorite distros just a real quick shout out to Antigros Antegoros and

168
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:30,780
What what do you say Wes? Hmm Antigros? Yeah, let's go with Antigros. Guess what Wes ZFS support out of the box

169
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,240
Whoa install they've redone their installer a whole bunch of new stuff. They're moving this over to stable

170
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,840
Wow, look at all those downloads who 52,000 384 downloads for since she's 0.12

171
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,820
It's interesting how they're almost focusing more on the installer than they are the distro itself

172
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,140
Since she's 0.14 development 148 days of developments 510 commits

173
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,540
46 bugs squashed look at the new installer there Wow

174
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,860
0.16 is looking real smooth and one of the new features is built-in ZFS support

175
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,140
You can install now

176
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,140
with ZFS work. Go ahead

177
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,420
Antegos is

178
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,540
Basically 90% essentially installer anyway. Yeah, I really it's good. Yeah, it really is

179
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,200
That's why I think it's actually kind of smart that they do this because otherwise it's essentially arch

180
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:23,820
Yeah, so I don't know I think that's pretty neat so they've obviously moved after Ubuntu made the news

181
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,980
But they must have been working on this already. Yeah, I would I would think so at least yeah, so this is cool

182
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,980
I think we're gonna have it you're gonna have in 1604

183
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,780
Which I guess would mean that Ubuntu Mate 1604 is gonna have ZFS support too

184
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,700
When is that gonna be available to me in any way if I do a installation?

185
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,220
What ZFS on Ubuntu Mate on the 1604 version?

186
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,300
Yeah, in just the same way it will be available on any Ubuntu flavor

187
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:55,500
All of the ZFS stuff is gonna be in the official archives, but that's not in the installer though, right? I don't think it's going to be in

188
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,380
Ubiquity now at least I've seen no evidence of that so far. Yeah, and we're in feature freeze now

189
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,360
so unless they do a feature freeze exception, I don't know but

190
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,460
I imagine it. Well, I don't know. Yeah, are you feeling good?

191
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,600
Maybe maybe if you use the minimal ISO, you know, you'd have to do a bit of fiddling you could use the minimal ISO

192
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,360
You know install that on the ZFS and then yeah install the right package for the desktop of your choice

193
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,680
I'm not thinking it's time to move your root file system over to ZFS

194
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,120
You could maybe make the argument for home or like a data partition, which you would set up maybe after installation anyways

195
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,980
But after your root partition or boot even

196
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,520
I'm not sure I'm ready to make that case yet. And if you are

197
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:45,720
You're gonna set up manually yourself. I'm not sure grub supports ZFS. So I don't think it could be used as um

198
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,200
Well, I guess you could just fun. He's a BSD has even better

199
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,240
Just fine. I've been using it for a long time. Oh, it does. How long is a long time?

200
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,760
I've been using it for two years at least a really well like a git version of like I like a fortune

201
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No. No, you definitely use a git version of grub, but you probably already are because

202
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
Yeah

203
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,160
That's true most distros are using a git check out

204
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,200
The question is does it support all the new features if you use less features than the latest you're probably okay

205
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,400
But if you're using a new grub, you're okay regardless. They support all the ZFS features

206
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,560
So are you saying you've been you've been booting off ZFS for two years?

207
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,680
Yes

208
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,120
Well, there you go. Even with slash boot even slash boot on ZFS

209
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,400
Oh, really and and how do you feel like performance overhead is for something like that? It's not bad. I

210
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,320
Wouldn't say you really notice very much. I mean I have a lot of RAM on my machines, so I'm not yeah

211
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,440
Okay. Well see that's that's me. That's interesting to me. That is interesting

212
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,480
And I know their work. They've just recently started working on it on BSD

213
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,760
So that's why I just didn't feel like I had a lot of testing right and it's another level if you expect any user

214
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,480
Who can use the installer to understand the file system?

215
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,480
So I feel like there's an argument there even if it works great. Yeah, huh? Well, look at that everybody

216
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,960
It's it's interesting 16 is the future. Yeah, it's the year of the Linux desktop

217
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:14,560
It is just depends on who you ask and what what desktop they're using. Yeah, I'm curious

218
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,800
I'm curious to see where elementary OS is going. I want to try that out

219
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:23,160
What what I agree with the kernel panic here computers have plenty of memory and CPU cycles. Yeah, that's well

220
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,760
I don't know. I don't know if I agree I could always use more

221
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,520
You know what else I could always use more of a good deal everybody do me a favor

222
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,560
Go check out ting linux ting comms the first sponsor this week

223
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,680
This is mobile. That really does make sense. In fact if

224
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,020
Aliens came to earth

225
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,920
They would look at all the other guys and they'd be like what the hell is the matter with you?

226
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,120
What are you doing? Why are you doing it that way?

227
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,040
And then they'd look at ting and go okay, and it's not just Kyra. They'd look at ting and they go

228
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,200
Oh that makes sense. That's how you should do it ting keeps rates simple

229
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,120
We don't make you pick a plan instead. You just use your phone as you normally would how much you use

230
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,960
Determines how much you pay each month. You can have as many devices as you want on one account

231
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,920
That's good

232
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,120
Because when you use more you pay less per minute message or megabyte of data

233
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,320
Your usage plus six dollars per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill

234
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,300
Simple that's what we mean when we say

235
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:23,300
Mobile that makes sense. So not only can you save earth from an alien invasion because they're pissed off about our mobile practices

236
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,620
By going to linux.ting.com, but you get $25 off a device

237
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,900
You get $25 in service credits if you have a compatible device and they have GSM and CDMA

238
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:37,500
So you just might moto II second-gen 99 bucks unlocked. No contract. Yeah

239
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:44,380
Yeah, they also have the tribute to which is a nice LG phone running Android. They got the Apple Internet phones

240
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,620
You know if you want to fight the FBI about those before. Yeah, here's a good one

241
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:53,140
I think this is like this this is this is the one I think I mean if you don't need like the

242
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,100
S6 or s7 or you don't need a nexus because they got the nexus is too. Yep

243
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:04,300
LG volt to 5-inch display tri-band LTE lollipop 5.1 show probably get an upgrade though

244
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:12,180
Yeah, but look at that's a nice phone. Of course lollipops not bad really 183 dollars. No contract nor the termination fee. That's nuts

245
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,660
LG's nexus 5 the og nexus 5 still in my pocket 215 bucks. Wow

246
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,540
Yeah, I know that's a really great phone still that is a really great phone the aqueous crystal

247
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:29,500
That's pretty nice the one plus one 290 or yeah 299 unlocked moto x they got all the great phones, right?

248
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:35,020
And they also have just the sim cards go over to linux.ting.com to support the show and while you're there

249
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,740
Do the savings calculator. That's fun. Do the same. Oh, yeah, kits and points. Yeah, that's a nice phone

250
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,340
Kitson points out that you could put cyanogen on that. That's true

251
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,520
You could put cyanogen on that volt shoot puts put cyanogen on that

252
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,280
You know ting has a really great community on reddit on their forums

253
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,700
They post YouTube videos where you can interact with them

254
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,940
The reason I bring this up is they're not gonna shame you if you want to put a some weird thing on your phone

255
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,340
Like they just want you to use their network and you know be a customer

256
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,020
I they won't not give you support because you did something different

257
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,000
No, I was straight up when I was trying out a boon to touch on ting. I was straight up honest with them

258
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,100
Yeah, I'm running a boon to touch and they're like, oh, that's awesome

259
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,800
Will you give us feedback on how that works on a network because we're watching that that was their response not

260
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,740
That's not an authorized phone operating system

261
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,900
But you're on violation of your terms of service like that's what they could have said, right?

262
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,940
No, they didn't say that linux.ting.com go there

263
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,100
Support the show and a big. Thank you to ting for sponsoring the Linux unplugged show

264
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,020
speaking of mobile devices

265
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,620
Mobile World Congress. Yeah, right now I'm not going on

266
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,620
This talks about it's the only thing in

267
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:42,100
In Barcelona, they have a fancy new phone over there at the Ubuntu booth that people have been checking out

268
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,680
I've been watching some videos of hands-on demos of it

269
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,220
And in fact, I posted in the chat room. I should probably go grab it real quick

270
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,380
But anyways people been looking at this new Mizzou Pro 5 and the verse says

271
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:00,360
Not good enough the verge talks about it being laggy the verge talks about it not responding to some interfaces

272
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,140
There's a good hardware design they say but they're worried that it's just too darn laggy

273
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,500
And I I think for you and I West that's kind of a big deal. Don't you think?

274
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,180
Your thoughts after you read something like this is

275
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,580
Is this just an issue because it's a pre-release phone or do you think this is something on a bigger picture level?

276
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,260
I don't know

277
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,580
It's hard to say I think I think there is a lot with the pre-release that you know

278
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,100
The fact that it runs that you've still got who punt you you've got you know

279
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,420
Real Linux right there on the phone a good-looking phone. The hardware looks nice. Yes. I think that's a lot

280
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,900
The hardware looks very nice and I'm gonna say Samsung's it's got one of Samsung's nice processors

281
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Any know like a really good processor, right? It's got a really good camera in it

282
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,360
And I do think that there's probably a significant amount of you know

283
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,820
Optimization for touch for quick response times rather than throughput kind of stuff that you see especially on real Linux

284
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,060
So I'm sure there's a lot of tunables. I'm hopeful

285
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,620
Probably really curious to see when you know the final production models roll out

286
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:54,940
All right

287
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,060
So here's what I'm really looking forward to and this is where I'm willing to give it some

288
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:03,600
I mean, I'm really really sensitive to lag but XTA developers have a video of convergence in action

289
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,700
Here we go actual real-world original stuff from Ubuntu phone

290
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,780
It's getting better. It's getting more refined, but that's not the exciting thing. I'm going to show you the exciting thing

291
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:19,140
I'm going to show you is convergence. We've now connected the phone to a monitor and it's automatically switched into windowed mode

292
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,220
So we've got the full Ubuntu desktop here

293
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,940
One of the new things we've got is the switcher. So I push into the right edge

294
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:31,980
And I can select an application and here you see Libre office

295
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,540
And this is running so any app that can run on Linux

296
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,640
Will run on this well arm Linux

297
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:46,820
Another nice feature we have is when you switch from phone onto the desktop a hundred percent of status preserved

298
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,420
That's kind of nice right that's really nice

299
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,260
No, I want that right now that sort of changes my opinion on it a little bit

300
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,300
I know anybody in the chat room have any thoughts on Ubuntu touch or is actually using it right now

301
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,820
I'd love to hear from somebody who's been actively on it. I know wouldn't be weren't you trying it for a bit? I

302
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,140
Yeah, I've been using it for a while and

303
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,740
Later this year. I'm gonna

304
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:15,100
Have an extended period period where Ubuntu for devices is the only thing I use

305
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,980
So the verge really really panned the experience the verge seemed very dissatisfied in the article

306
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,940
They published today from Mobile World Congress. Do you have any kind of was that to do with them they?

307
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,740
the

308
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,500
Into user interface and the phone operating system or more the hardware. Well, I

309
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,220
You know, I mean it's on this. It's on this mu as profile that it has the snapdragon processor in it

310
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,220
You know, it's supposed to be pretty good hardware

311
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:53,300
Yeah, I don't know I don't know if they're Apple buys or not and when the last meizu device

312
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,900
Shipped with Ubuntu it

313
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,700
It

314
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:05,480
Took a couple of revs to iron out, you know, some of the kinks they I seem to have had some difficulty

315
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,680
You know getting all working smoothly. So maybe it's just you know, yeah

316
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,460
Yeah, and my accident in the Mamba room. You've been running it for a bit. What are your impressions?

317
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,660
I've been playing around with it. I've been trying to

318
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:24,100
trying to get it in a state where it does all things I'm doing with Android and I find

319
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:30,060
The the I really like the system and I really like the the sort of I don't want to use the word paradigms

320
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,980
Because it sounds rubbish

321
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:38,060
But you know the the the style they're going for with the swiping from the edges and and the general feel of the system

322
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,700
I really like it. But when I come to try and use the apps, I find that there's you know

323
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:48,820
If they're just not mature like the ones I'm using on Android are that's where it really falls down for me at the moment

324
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,860
I don't have the features which I just think oh

325
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,280
a pod catcher will have this or an audio book player will have this and then I go looking for them and

326
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,220
There's just they're missing that that feature that I use all the time

327
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:06,620
So this chicken and egg problem for sure and the mu s5 pro looks really really nice

328
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:12,660
Like I think it even has like a super high-end. I even be 20 something megapixel camera. I got really high-end camera

329
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,000
USB-c charging there. It looks like is that USB-c or mini? It looks like you

330
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,320
Use to be see it kind of looks like an iPhone to be honest. Yes, it does. It does but

331
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,640
Linux on your iPhone. Hey, that doesn't sound bad wide power button on the side

332
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Oh, wow, look they have actually have it right there next to an iPhone

333
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Yeah, so

334
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,280
Yeah, we'll see huh? We'll say meizu meizu not my zoo meizu. Thank you. Oh

335
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,720
Yes, wimpy. Tell me about the UK that you that is right the UI usability study that we'd mentioned you ended up participating in it

336
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
Do you have anything to share about that?

337
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Well, yes, I was actually the first person to

338
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,080
Participate in that

339
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,880
Usability. Wow, that was a week and a half ago. I think I was there

340
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:07,440
So I'm not gonna go into too much detail because I'd be stealing show content from upcoming Ubuntu podcast

341
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,120
But I suppose I suppose the thing to take away from that is that

342
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:19,240
they are actually looking at the user experience of the phone and

343
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,560
The applications and not just the core apps that are being developed by canonical

344
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,440
But also some of the community contributed apps. So there is an effort to you know, try and

345
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
improve

346
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
the the

347
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,480
User experience across the board and did you say would you say why you were there that you witnessed?

348
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,160
Somebody giving pushback saying this doesn't make sense and then being receptive to that pushback

349
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:52,440
Absolutely. Oh, that's good to hear. Okay, you know, that's that goes a long way and then they can also say, you know

350
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,440
We've tested this

351
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,400
Speaking of testing

352
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,700
Wow, 100 million users are testing the hell out of telegram and I bring this up on Linux unplugged because

353
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:09,220
The secret is this is like one of the number one messaging apps now on Linux

354
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:15,860
Mm-hmm is telegram freaking telegram and you were looking at at a telegram alternative. Do you remember what that was called?

355
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:22,020
It was like an open source. I think you put it probably in our message thread. I believe I did they say check this out

356
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,460
Telegram now has 100 million monthly active users

357
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,500
350,000 news your sign up each freaking day and they are delivering

358
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:38,580
15 billion messages Wow daily 15 billion. That is that is really nuts

359
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:45,580
Yeah, and and it really has undoubtedly become one of the largest one of the largest Linux messaging programs

360
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,300
Did you find it there with just about it waiting for slack? Oh, jeez

361
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,460
That's what you get for not using matter most West

362
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,620
I know after that big that low latency maybe on some sort of server that do you think it would you think it would be

363
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,160
Faster is that is that a thing because you know, I could always use faster

364
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,620
That is something I could take

365
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:08,380
So anyways West had found a project that looks like it may have some relation to actor. I am actor

366
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:14,460
Yes, okay actor. I am and it looks like what West this has some relation to the telegram folks

367
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,220
Yeah, I believe it's being worked on at least by some people formerly associated with the telegram project

368
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,940
It's free secure photo and voice messages all under an Apache 2 license and they're talking about it

369
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:30,500
I believe so I have not verified that myself and they're talking about integrating signals protocol

370
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,920
Which I know a lot of people have spoken good things about it looks just like telegram. It really does

371
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,640
Huh, that's interesting

372
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,460
So if it has the same performance and maybe a better or more open back end

373
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,260
That would be interesting because one of my favorite things about telegram is it really just works. The question is is what?

374
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,700
what

375
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:54,900
Encryption. Yes, are they using daredevil and you know a quick trick to see how many users are actively on telegram at any given time

376
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,900
What's that? I

377
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,140
Don't hear you I do not sorry. Yes

378
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,820
Yes

379
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,700
The trick the trick is they use in at least an Android phones

380
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,360
They use the accounts and when you're going to your contacts app and you're going to export your contacts

381
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,860
It shows telegram as an option even though it will not export them

382
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:20,240
It will show the number of actual users registered in telegram. Yeah. Oh, ah

383
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:27,520
Interesting good catch. I also by the way just one more thing before we get off the telegram topic

384
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,800
I gave a quick mention during last that I was impressed that the linux mint project was communicating

385
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,880
Via the tub, there's a there's a group I subscribe to on telegram with security alert notifications

386
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,080
And I thought maybe I'd share that with the rest of you since I've gotten some questions about hey

387
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,040
What group did you subscribe to to to get those those alerts?

388
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,040
So let's see. It's a if you go to telegram me slash it sec alert

389
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,840
this subscribes you to a telegram group that is essentially a read-only group of

390
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,280
Well IT security alerts Wow, so like when Linux make got hacked

391
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,000
This was one of the first place and since then there's been like 18 other projects that have been hacked and there's been a notification

392
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,000
That's been posted on this telegram group. And so it's kind of a neat thing. I'll put a link in the chat room

393
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,840
And so this was one of the ways I found out about Linux mint being hacked over the weekend was by this group again

394
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:24,960
That's telegram me slash it sec alert and you know what? I'll throw a link in the show notes, too

395
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,920
So that way if you guys you guys want to cover that mumble or many other thoughts on the telegram or open source chat or secure

396
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,920
chat before we move on I

397
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,620
Just hope they finally get the back end free software, too

398
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah

399
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,800
That would be the big difference if actor has the the full client is open source like the back end is there they have a server

400
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,320
Pulled her in there. I like that. I like that. I think that's a good thing

401
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,880
Yeah

402
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:57,800
Yeah, yes, we did EKS we did EKS just joins the chat room. Hold on. Hold on just for EKS standby. I'm standby. This is

403
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,640
Yes

404
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:08,400
EKS we have reported that Anna gross is integrating ZFS in their installer but just reconfirming if you're just joining us live now on

405
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,880
The jblive.tv stream. It has been confirmed ZFS support has been added

406
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,120
Knowing Chris he will be reinstalling his machine right before the show next week

407
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,360
That's so stay tuned that is very possible. All right, so Linux mint

408
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,380
They got compromised over the weekend Clem took to the Linux mint blog and said hey

409
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,400
I've shut down the servers where this is happening at. Oh, by the way

410
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:35,480
Clem you're also your forum server god. Oh, okay. I'm gonna shut that server down. Okay now we have shut this server down

411
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:41,140
Oh, yeah, they replaced the MD five sums. Don't pay attention to the MD five sums. You download use these MD five sums. Oh

412
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:47,640
Boy, this just started getting out of control and shortly after that you started seeing everybody talking about it by Sunday afternoon

413
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,440
Everybody was talking about it. Uncle Leo was talking about it on Twitter

414
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,620
Oh dear Leo ed bot was taking shots at mint

415
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,940
Exaggerating the scope of the flaws ZD net got an exclusive interview with the attacker

416
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,700
And got all the details. We're gonna talk about all of that

417
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,700
And and we're not gonna sit here and rub Linux mint in the ground

418
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,060
It's more about it's really more about the meta discussion that needs to happen here

419
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:18,660
And maybe maybe towards the end if we could bring the discussion to a place and say where we can maybe answer the question

420
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:24,460
What could be done as a community to solve the problem of verifying the source and identity of an ISO?

421
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:29,540
And I know there's a lot of different ways we can accomplish this you can have you can have lots of different signatures

422
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,540
You can have there's MD five sums today all these things exist. But what if there was?

423
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:41,260
Maybe something centralized maybe it's distributed like through a blockchain some way to verify the identity identity of files

424
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,860
That was reliable and distributed. Oh, man, that could be pretty cool. So let's start talking about mint

425
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,740
What's happened since the Linux action show on Sunday?

426
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:57,540
and then maybe we can sort of end up with that bigger conversation about what could be a really cool long-term solution to this problem and

427
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:03,500
Maybe you'd host that solution to this problem that long-term so I know where I would a digital ocean droplet West

428
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,700
Come on, don't fool around use the promo code deal unplugged and get a $10 credit over a digital ocean com

429
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:14,020
It's a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering most intuitive and easy way for you get a super badass Linux rig in no time

430
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:18,400
They have all Linux machines run on KVM virtualizer with SSDs for the disk

431
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,660
IO you can get started less than 55 seconds and pricing plan start Oh

432
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:28,220
Five dollars a month five a month. That's right. Get your 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSDs

433
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:34,660
Because they're all SSDs a CPU that's super fast a terabyte of transfer and moa

434
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:40,900
Oh, what's more you ask their crazy great interface and super straightforward API that interface man

435
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900
That is an innovation of humanity

436
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,740
Managing virtual machines with an interface like this. It's ridiculous. It should be illegal

437
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,460
It's so awesome. If the US government knew they'd be taxing them on their on their innovation

438
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:59,220
I'll tell you what else digital ocean supplies the back-end hosting for tons of open source projects that we know we love and we download

439
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,220
from every single day not to mention

440
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,780
The very mumble room we're talking to our virtual love no way. That's right

441
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:10,340
Digital oceans your place to go to spin up a Linux infrastructure when you need it. They got Debian's

442
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,900
They got the core OS is they got the fedoras the Ubuntu's

443
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,120
They've even got no free BSD

444
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,140
That's true. That's true. They have great tutorials to help you really take it up a notch

445
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,040
So, you know what you can look like a boost

446
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,740
They make it easy to take backups move them around wipe them and start over again when you screw something up real bad because you

447
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:34,940
Know you will that's what it's all about. And what I love about the pricing is it's

448
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,660
hourly

449
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:41,420
So you could really just go spin up a rig for like a few hours and try something cray-cray see if it goes

450
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,020
And if it don't go blow it away and if a go-go you keep it

451
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:48,100
Then we use I know and when you use the promo code deal unplugged

452
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,660
The decisions made for you because you get the $10 credits

453
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:56,220
You can go create your virtual server infrastructure on demand in less than 55 seconds for free for two months

454
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:02,100
Now if that's not boss mode, I don't know what is digital ocean comm and a big. Thank you to digital ocean

455
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,300
For sponsoring Linux unplugged

456
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,180
Okay

457
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,500
Before we get into the Linux mint story

458
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,500
I thought I would read a little bit from the CD net article and then I'll open up to the mumble room to kind of

459
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Jump in but the hacker

460
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:25,220
Known as peace had a nice chitchat with that was Zach white talker

461
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:30,140
Or white taker Whitaker. Oh, I like my version a lot better West

462
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:35,660
Thanks that Zach white taker. He taker of white men. He comes in and he talks about

463
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,180
What this guy did to Linux mint and I don't understand

464
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:48,620
Zach apparently writes for security websites, but yet he talks about Linux like somebody who's never heard of it before but anyways

465
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,940
So the hacker responsible who goes by the name of peace told me in an encrypted chat

466
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:58,140
Probably telegram on Sunday that a few hundred Linux mint installs

467
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:04,580
Remained under their control a significant portion of the thousand-plus downloads during the day. Wow. How about that, huh?

468
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:12,140
Peace also claimed to have stolen an entire copy of the site's form not once but twice friends once on January 28th

469
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:18,140
Happy birthday, Chris. Mine was my birthday 26, but yeah and February 18th two days before the hack was confirmed

470
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:25,780
The hacker shared a portion of the form dump, which we verified to contain some personal identifiable info like birthdays profile pictures

471
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,780
passwords emails

472
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,380
those passwords also might not stay for very stay safe for very long because

473
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,740
Clem was using PHP pass to hash the passwords which has known flaws

474
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,900
It later emerged that the hacker had placed the full form dump on a dark web marketplace

475
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:48,660
Which that's what you do. Yeah, which he wanted, you know 85 bucks cuz well he needed 85 bucks

476
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,100
So he asked for it in Bitcoin peace was just jokey or I'm sorry poking around

477
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,580
The site in January when he found or say they found a vulnerability granting unauthorized access

478
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,620
The hacker also said they used credentials to log into the site's admin panel as Clem

479
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,340
But we're reluctant to explain how

480
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:11,340
It provided useful later on I could think of a few ways though on Saturday

481
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,420
The hacker replaced one of the 64-bit Linux distribution images

482
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:19,940
That's an ISO for those of you at home with one that was modified by adding a back door and later

483
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:26,020
Decided to replace all the mirrors for every downloadable version with the Linux on the site with their own version aka

484
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:33,060
Altered the site links to point to their versions the backdoor version isn't as difficult as you'd think piece in because oh, no

485
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,380
That's right. This is one of the things the author just threw in here. This is not a quote

486
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,180
From the hacker. This is a quote from

487
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,300
Zach Whitetaker here

488
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,820
Zach Whitetaker adds

489
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:53,140
The backdoor version isn't as difficult as you'd think because the code is open-source the hacker said it just took a few hours

490
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:57,460
To repack Linux that contained the backdoor. What does that have to do with being open-source?

491
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:02,740
It just means it's easy to do those closed source ISO files Chris. Yeah, I can't touch them

492
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,020
I just like this and this guy's like it's supposed to be a like a journalist that writes on this stuff all the time

493
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:13,580
Anyways, the hacker used their access to change legitimate checksums and used and which people then download to verify the integrity

494
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,860
checksums checked out peace said the first hacking episode start in late January, but peaked when

495
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,100
They started spreading the backdoor images early Saturday morning

496
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,700
They had no specific goal to their attack, but peace said that their motivation was essentially to build a botnet

497
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,180
Using this anomaly bit malware that we talked about in Linux action show

498
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,220
For now the hackers motive was just having access in general

499
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:40,100
But they did not rule out using the body to carry out data mining or many other nefarious means in the meantime the hackers botnet

500
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:46,660
Is still up and running, but the number of infected machines has dropped significantly since the news broke on Saturday

501
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,620
Peace confirmed Clem decided not to respond for comment to the article

502
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:02,380
Okay, dare Devlin so you think it's not a big deal at all not a big deal at all. Tell me why so I will say

503
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,100
Not a big deal at all because in one if criminal.org

504
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,980
was able to be at the our target and existence of much simpler less

505
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,020
feature

506
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,820
oriented website

507
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:21,500
Yes, it's okay to understand that the project like Linux Mint could be infected actually any project has

508
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:29,860
That same issue in the sense of there is a likelihood of having you know being a target

509
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,860
So this is number one or two

510
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:38,300
Most people how that use the the Linux Mint already have it installed. They're probably upgrading their packages

511
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,780
Which also means that if you already have it installed in your district properly roles

512
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,580
Which is usually something that Linux mix tends to do somewhat decently

513
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,140
We're not downloading as often

514
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:57,180
So they say thousands of people download the ISO they say a few hundred are still running the botnet

515
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:03,660
Yeah, a few hundred are still running the button at those thousands that downloaded like how many times have you downloaded because you couldn't find

516
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,660
That CD just out of laziness

517
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
I've downloaded

518
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:13,980
Yeah, out of laziness. You couldn't find that CD or that USB stick or that I so you did that. Yeah, I

519
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,780
That's not really

520
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,740
Okay, that's critical. I wouldn't call it critical for the amount of users living to me that has so Swift

521
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:25,780
You also think it's critical for the amount of users living to me that has so Swift

522
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,260
You also think this has sort of been blown out of proportion. It's not really good to go after Linux Mint

523
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,460
Yes, it's bad for the community in general. I mean we need to

524
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,700
Really look at this as being an opportunity. Yes to make improvements

525
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,780
But overall it's gonna be beneficial for the whole community

526
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:48,060
They're gonna see areas where their weaknesses and then patch those things and just do better and better over time, you know

527
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,340
Patrolling different channels about Linux and saying Linux Mint sucks

528
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:58,020
That's not gonna help anything and it makes me question a person's you know, really intent intentions

529
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,220
So I gotta tell you guys

530
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,860
I've definitely noticed they that the dogs are out

531
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,300
Yeah

532
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:08,900
And what's what's really kind of impressive about it is the dogs are out

533
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,140
Inside the Linux community and they're going after Linux Mint and Clem

534
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,940
most of it seems to be a bunch of cranky package maintainers who like are from Debbie and who've had like

535
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,480
Package name namespace issues and things like that

536
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,260
But there are a lot of people that are very upset pointing out a multitude of issues

537
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,780
Rodden corpse. What do you think?

538
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,020
I mean

539
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:32,100
Do you think this part of the reason why this is getting as much attention is because there are outstanding issues or with Linux Mint that

540
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,380
People still argue. Well, this is just another example of the overall problem

541
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,540
Yeah, there's like that you mentioned the package manager issues

542
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:45,780
I mean the namespace is a problem the priority control is a problem the fact that they you mean for the kernel updates

543
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:50,180
Oh dad their kernel base, but they have priority controls over their own packages

544
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:56,340
so if they have a package that is in your as in their repo and is updated in Ubuntu and

545
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:03,340
Linux Mint doesn't change that and doesn't you know recognize that the thing has been updated. You're not gonna get that update and

546
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,660
That's nothing to do with whether you have the same package or not

547
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,340
It's just they have a priority that is much higher than anything else

548
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:16,860
So even if you install a PPA sometimes the mint priority just overtakes it and you cannot get it installed unless you manually force it

549
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:23,180
So there's like weird little bugs like that that men is done that are like legitimate problems

550
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,700
But this overhyped thing about you know, they're it being insecure is

551
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:33,420
Just pretty much garbage. Well, okay. So Wes you have a laptop. Here's your work laptop

552
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,980
you run mint on it sort of a standard practice cinnamon edition as a matter of fact and

553
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,860
You watch this stuff

554
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,140
Let's talk here's a couple things on the top of my head that mint kind of gets tossed around for for not really

555
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,660
addressing some say they

556
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:54,060
Inappropriately just pull from the Ubuntu repos and sort of right on top of that their bandwidth their infrastructure, etc

557
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,700
They distribute now, of course, they make isos available that don't have this stuff

558
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:05,020
But they distribute isos with codecs and flash pre-installed which many distributions see fedora and others

559
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:08,180
So you can't actually do there seems to be no regard for that

560
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,700
Although an attempt is made to make an ISO available without them, but it exists nonetheless

561
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:18,460
There's also the the matter of sort of avoiding kernel updates as a matter of actual desktop policy

562
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,580
Then there's the there's the whole create your own X apps, etc, etc

563
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:27,700
When you look at all of this in whole are we seeing something here that is perhaps

564
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,220
Indicative of

565
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,220
Some

566
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:40,660
Things that are just not properly being taken care of and when you when you look at it as a as a Linux Mint user

567
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,900
Are you worried?

568
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,500
That their eyes off the ball on a few of these things they could have somebody come after them for legal issues when it comes

569
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:53,460
To the codecs. They've obviously got infrastructure problems with when it comes to the security. Why why why wasn't why weren't the MD?

570
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,260
Five sums properly signed. Why weren't they properly signed?

571
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:03,540
It's an easy thing to do that anybody that has a moderately large distribution would probably want to have done. They didn't even bother doing it

572
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,540
Right. Why wasn't why why were these things missed?

573
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:11,740
Does that bother you? I think it shows a lot of the and I don't I'm not gonna call them growing pains

574
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:17,200
But just Linux Mint has gained a lot in popularity since its early days like 13 or whatever, right?

575
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:22,220
And it really is, you know, you can't compared a lot to fedora or a bunch of these are both

576
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:29,700
Distributions with companies behind them Linux Mint is you know a volunteer team and not only are they focusing on you know

577
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,060
building

578
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:35,700
Well an operating system but building a whole skin for an operating system as well as these new X apps and all that

579
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,260
But they have to run all the infrastructure and I think it's showing that

580
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,660
You don't you know, it takes a lot to do that

581
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,580
And especially if your passion is I want to make I'm working on you know

582
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:51,300
Cinnamon a whole DE that they're building here. You probably don't have any cycles left as they're running a first-rate infrastructure. Hmm

583
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,440
but I guess I do it I guess I don't know if I

584
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:00,120
Yeah, I guess I guess like I mostly I guess I mostly agree. It feels like

585
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,820
It feels like it is a bit of a growing thing

586
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,420
But at the same time it feels like it's also just a lack of priority

587
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,020
I guess before I go too far

588
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,900
I think I think one of the things is maybe not serving Linux Mint at this point is

589
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:18,180
Clem has traditionally been anti media anti interview closed off

590
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:22,460
It doesn't doesn't do them as sort of a matter of policy for him personally

591
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:26,740
Good or bad what that is kind of left is it kind of left a lot of people to fill in the gaps about what?

592
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,540
Clem thinks about things

593
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,740
Until something like this happens and then all as we can do from the outside is go

594
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,860
Well, why didn't he have the why didn't he have the hashes signed?

595
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:39,420
Why was WordPress not bubble like we can all we can all sit here and play you know

596
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,220
Like hindsight's 2020 kind of thing

597
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,460
But I guess I don't want to bash on him for it

598
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,300
But I I do look at it and I go this may be indicative of larger problems

599
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,820
I think it is indicative of larger problems, and I think

600
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:55,220
If mitts gonna I guess if mitts gonna keep growing these are problems

601
00:45:55,220 --> 00:46:00,380
They're gonna get you have to really reflect on how you build what you're doing. They're gonna be that scale exactly

602
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,540
That's the problem is well guess what now?

603
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:08,300
We're here or at the scale and these problems are and it's kind of things like Linux is great for letting you set up right like

604
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,180
He could build this website on a couple of servers that runs and distributes for his distribution

605
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:17,220
But once you're a popular Linux distribution you get a lot more attention than you do if you're just you know one of the ones

606
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,220
in the weeds and you start needing to like

607
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,580
Sky go after you that only went kits and I want you to jump in and share your thoughts on this so far

608
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:29,420
Actually, I think that a site like a distro watch could really help with something like this

609
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,780
They could host the checksums

610
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:37,260
They could even make it a little interface to where he could download the torrents or the ISOs

611
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,580
What happens when they get hacked?

612
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:46,020
And then everybody's compromised. I would hope that they would have better security. I would hope that about Linux mint

613
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,820
I mean this is this is probably a good question

614
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:55,620
Because I don't I don't think this is something unique to mint anybody could run into this issue

615
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:59,940
I would have if I started my own distro, right? I mean it could happen to JB

616
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,220
yeah, and so I feel like maybe that maybe we as a group could come up with a

617
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:09,220
Better solution something that is maybe I don't know

618
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,620
So I'm gonna start with Micah Lee Micah Lee he he wrote a blog post and a couple of things jumped out at me

619
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:19,620
He said it's also important to note that comparing the checksums of the file you downloaded with ones you see on a website

620
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,980
You download isn't secure either and this is always like we all check the checks on the trucks on

621
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:30,180
Even if you using Shaw 256 if a hacker can hack the website to modify the download link

622
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,120
They can modify the checksum at the same time to match the malicious download

623
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,260
The only solution to this problem is to use public key

624
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,440
cryptography and

625
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,860
I that seems to that seems to register with me is this is a wider problem that all distros have

626
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,720
When it comes to actually verifying the ISO that you get go ahead. Hmm

627
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,640
Well, no, not every distro tails

628
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:59,840
I think is the only one that actually one of the ones I remember that actually provides a PGP key to verify the guy

629
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:05,080
So far that makes sense. Yeah, you know other than that almost all projects never do most of the time

630
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:14,040
But don't other distros besides don't other distros besides tails also GPG sign wizard you're mentioning other distros do this as well, right?

631
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:14,740
Yeah

632
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,340
So the thing is near almost every distro I can think of off top of my head

633
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:26,240
That most people flock to is one that I you know, everyone uses the GPG key to sign their final ISO release

634
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,460
I mean it's built by the main, you know, the main build server and then it's pushed out

635
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,240
It's tested and then they sign it and say okay

636
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:39,120
Put it up there with the GPG key so that the mirrors will go and we'll only copy that specific file with

637
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,200
GPG key that we've signed and they know that GPG key, right?

638
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:48,440
And it would have been a huge thing if the mirrors had come back when this hell happened to mint and said hey

639
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:53,600
Your GPG key just changed. Is there a reason you know why right?

640
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:59,280
It would have it would have saved them so much trouble. It would have probably been alerted them immediately

641
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:06,280
Maybe I mean you're still relying on end-users to check and I think that's sort of the failing bit about it

642
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,600
It needs to be a system that almost checks itself sort of like how a bit torrent right and distributed so that it can check

643
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:16,900
Multiple and make sure that you know, well if you're the check some for this or the signature for this match as well from this

644
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:24,820
You have the solution just we need to get the OEMs to install a UE

645
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,260
UEFI key that actually, you know

646
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:31,180
Yeah, yeah

647
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,260
Secure boot everybody

648
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,180
God oh no

649
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:43,820
You probably right to which would be which would work as long as Clem didn't you know? Yeah

650
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:47,380
Yeah, that's true. I feel like that gets good at having that set

651
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,460
I

652
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:56,820
Think this is a good point for rolling these truths. I mean you're not installing all the time

653
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:04,940
Seriously, it won't be an issue at least for that long. Yeah, and well people reporting non-user centric bugs

654
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,700
Should be having more attention because usually those are not exposed

655
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:14,580
exposed it's like well, there is this thing what we're gonna keep it quiet because we want to fix it and

656
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:20,020
Things are forgotten. I think before we move on one thing. I wanted to just mention is

657
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:26,020
I was pretty damn surprised at how the Linux community has turned on mint

658
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,100
during this

659
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:36,820
One of the one of the more popular Linux weekly news threads right now is I don't think Linux mint is a is a

660
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:40,660
Pot as a professionally built distribution, and there's a whole

661
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:44,020
deep conversation going on right there and a

662
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:50,900
Lot of it is a bunch of people who just seemed to be upset from previous encounters and things like that kind of dogpiling

663
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,420
Right now, and it's I think it's a little unfortunate

664
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:59,620
I I think it's unfortunate that this happened, and I think that bad is on Clem, but I think at the same time

665
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,860
What he needs to do now, and if he did this I think if he just came you know

666
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,420
He's already been pretty transparent and straightforward and so now if just moving forward

667
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,860
He's very honest and transparent about what they're doing to resolve the issue

668
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,740
And how this isn't gonna happen again, and why they know it's not gonna happen again talk about your new infrastructure

669
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,380
Talk about what you're changing. That's all it takes right. Yeah

670
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,960
That's what it takes people will read it and be interested and you'll get you know you lose users

671
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,880
Yeah, but you'll get new users. You see yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree okay wizard you get the the final word here

672
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,020
No, I was just gonna say the main people that are pushing this

673
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:36,460
are a couple people that have a little bit of sour grapes because they've dealt with these projects before and

674
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,180
they have had disagreements and

675
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:46,460
Some of those people tend to think that if you don't follow their agreement, then you're you know you can't possibly be right

676
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:54,540
So there's just no everyone's jumping on everyone right now because everyone's going and saying ha ha I told you and

677
00:51:54,540 --> 00:52:00,060
You know so a little for a little while. I think you're gonna see people jumping all over the place

678
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:06,140
Yeah, I think you're probably right, and you know that is sort of the price you pay when something like this happens, right?

679
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:13,380
That is sort of unfortunately the thing and that is why I broke my wordpress installation Sunday night upgrading wordpress

680
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:16,300
Because I didn't want to be the guy that was talking about this with a night

681
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,200
Please don't go pick on me because really I don't have enough time to work on this and you know

682
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:26,480
We need some white hack JB stuff here make sure I wonder if this is across Clem's mind because I've definitely talked about this on

683
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,480
Air there's several times. I thought I just need to drop wordpress. I don't have time

684
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,720
I mean, I think wordpress is a great super awesome project

685
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,000
And I don't have any problems with it

686
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,080
But I also like I'm not here to manage a website right and I I just I don't nobody is

687
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,040
nobody is here to manage a website everybody else has got something else to do and

688
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,520
The problem is that that means it just sort of sits and it's one of those things that really does need to be managed

689
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,800
Yeah, I was see I was thinking about going to ghost exactly see either remembers

690
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:57,400
I was but then the thing the issue was is they I started looking at all the features

691
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,020
We'd have to rebuild and I thought oh gosh well and the ghost download was just down for a little while they moved to Singapore

692
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,680
Okay, all right

693
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,440
All right, so Swift wraps it up with he says well Swift

694
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,560
Do you want to you could you want to just sort of say what you just said in the chat room sort of as our?

695
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,360
final thought on the topic

696
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:20,200
Yeah, I want to make it clear. I honestly trust Clem Linux mint has not lost my support at all

697
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,600
I'm sorry this happened, but it ultimately will be good for the latest community as a whole. I hope so

698
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,120
I hope that is a very good way to put it

699
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,960

But wait an all-episode for this

732
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,000
So I as you may have been aware

733
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,480
West

734
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,220
last week

735
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,280
after

736
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:11,560
445 days of waiting I had a chance to try out the purism Libra ultimate Linux laptop

737
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,960
And I don't know if you know what to get the timing right on this

738
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,480
So we're gonna go to the horse's mouth directly here for just for a moment

739
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,240
But my recollection goes down like this in the time since I backed the purism a

740
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:29,760
Company I'd never heard of called intro where has come around and it started shipping laptops preloaded by the way with Ubuntu Mate and

741
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,520
They have a couple of different products out there

742
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:38,920
We'll talk more about that in a sec, but the one that I want to talk about today is intro where's Apollo laptop

743
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:46,360
It's it's I think it starts a base price around 700 US greenbacks somewhere around there depending on the conversion rate

744
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,640
it is a 13-inch laptop and

745
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,760
I have it here in my hands and they sent me a version of the Apollo

746
00:56:53,800 --> 00:57:00,560
pretty well spec'd to see how it stacks up to the Libra 15 and others in terms of build quality performance and

747
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,580
All of that so I have it here. They have had it for about 24 hours

748
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:11,900
And before we go any further I want to introduce Mike from intro where Mike welcome to Linux unplugged and tell the folks listening

749
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,680
What you do over there at intro where what is that title of yours?

750
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,880
I

751
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:22,960
Hi, I'm the co-founder of intro and we build Linux computers for the UK at the moment and soon

752
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,320
some of Europe and

753
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,480
The Apollo arrived on my doorstep

754
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,880
yesterday and

755
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,880
It is a 13-inch laptop

756
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,920
very similar in in sort of look to say a MacBook Air or

757
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:47,560
Or really the Apollo 15 only I'm sorry the Libra 15 only 13 inches very very very good build quality

758
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:53,520
And so Mike I'm just curious. I I don't actually think are you selling these in the US at the moment?

759
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,800
No, we're not selling in the US for a while

760
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,960
The reason why yours got a US keyboard layout is because we're going to be shipping them to some

761
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:06,940
EU countries because they also use that layout. Oh my gosh. I got you

762
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:12,300
So a little bit about the Apollo if you would give can you give me some background on how this computer came to be?

763
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,620
and

764
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,940
Any kind of interesting details about the Apollo?

765
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:22,380
Yeah, we started selling when his computer is about a year and a half ago, maybe two

766
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:28,940
We got a lot of requests for an ultrabook and we just found

767
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,020
An ODM in China where we could have them built and shipped over

768
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,300
It is it you make it sound so simple

769
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:41,580
But what I find to be remarkable about it, and this is something that every single person that I have

770
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,300
Put this in their hands and said

771
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:49,140
Is it feels really really sturdy really well built and?

772
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:54,300
And they also people often tell me it feels a little heavy which I think adds to that it feels well built right

773
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,860
And so I'm curious to how

774
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:01,740
It was a matter of finding the right builder was it what what is it that?

775
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:07,500
Entraware has been able to accomplish here when it comes to build quality that other vendors sort of in the space. Maybe haven't gotten to

776
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:23,300
Is it just happened to be the partner builds a good machine because I mean it seems feel wise it's it's pretty significantly well built

777
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:30,180
Yeah, so we approached a few people and these are one of the few that did solid build

778
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,900
So one of the few that did solid aluminium chassis

779
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:39,100
So we chose them obviously because they had to build quality and then the keyboard also

780
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:44,340
I don't know what the process was of selecting the keyboard, but versus some of the others the keyboard is pretty nice, too

781
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:49,860
And feels good in the hand the keys are actually translucent so the backlighting shines through

782
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,260
Which is nice and the fan?

783
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:59,820
Isn't running crazy loud the fan actually seems to properly cool the machine which was a nice surprise

784
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,540
When I took it out of the box

785
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:07,020
Was there any particular tricks you guys had to pull to make this thing work properly with Linux or was it all pretty easy?

786
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:11,820
Well the first the first revision we had there was a few problems with the farm

787
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,980
We had the mind out in the firmware, so that's no go yeah

788
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:21,860
I would I would agree so if there was definitely some problems with the fan if you ran into the same problems

789
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:26,940
I did so if I wipe the if I wipe the OS that this came loaded with will the fan still work fine

790
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:32,780
Or will it stop working normally no exactly the same as what it's doing now, so it's firmware level then it's totally hard

791
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:38,740
Well, that's awesome. So I got it so my first impressions of this are this is one of the most well-built laptops

792
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:43,860
I've ever held would you agree? Oh, yeah, I really want one now. Yeah, so it's got one

793
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:51,140
two USB 3.0 ports plus USB C. It's got an SD card slot reader full-size HDMI out and

794
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,820
Headphone jack and entry where was kind enough to include a USB

795
01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:03,500
Ethernet box because there's no USB Ethernet on this it's got a 13 inch screen 1080p resolution on it two hard drives a

796
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:08,940
500 gigabyte spinning for the home and a 120 gigabyte SSD for the root

797
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,160
Yeah, two hard drives in a in a 13 inch laptop, too

798
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,920
Mike that's a pretty impressive spec a skylake Intel processor

799
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,920
And it's silent. I haven't heard it sound since I've been here. Yeah

800
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,160
That's a pretty impressive piece of hardware is the are the Apollo cells

801
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,400
Meeting your expectations

802
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,680
Yeah, they keep growing as we get more publicity on them because they are really good for the price

803
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,080
Yeah, I use a base $700 now the base $700

804
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:42,600
Yeah, I think has like an i3 and 4 gigs of RAM, but you just bring it up from there

805
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:49,400
And and then and then Mike could you talk a little bit about the choice to work with Ubuntu Mate?

806
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,400
What drove that and how's that going?

807
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:59,560
Well as approached by Martin about a year ago, and we just had a back-and-to when I was a big fan of the project

808
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,560
So it was obviously a good

809
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:06,000
Move to start shipping of our machines. Yeah, it feels fast

810
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,640
You know it's my first experience with it when you get a machine

811
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,520
You know with a nice fast skylake processor and plenty of RAM

812
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,520
And then you throw the Mate desktop on there with with the Ubuntu base

813
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,120
It feels really snappy so ready to go yeah, and the battery life

814
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,480
I don't have numbers yet, but the battery life has been pretty good

815
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,000
I think part of that is because the desktop environment just isn't really very demanding

816
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,360
So you feel like you get a nice performing computer with a very reasonable

817
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,400
Modern desktop plus you get someone like intro right here

818
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,000
We're like they're a company right so like if you have problems longer term

819
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,440
You know they're they're gonna be around to support them and to fix them

820
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,000
so the number one question Mike that everybody in the chat room wants and has is

821
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:50,440
How how how likely and possible is it for intro where to eventually start selling in the US is that a possibility for you guys?

822
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,440
Or is that just a lot of trouble?

823
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,240
There is a possibility, but we'll wait for we're gonna wait for a few more

824
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,240
A larger amount of orders before we start shipping over there. We're gonna

825
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:07,000
Make sure all of the you saw it first. Yeah, yeah, you get it nailed there that makes a lot to work on the JB group

826
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,200
Order yeah

827
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,040
There you go. Yeah group order this thing is

828
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,840
Boy, I can't wait to just keep trying it over the week

829
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:19,880
This is this is gonna be my main machine for the week seems like a great little just getting stuff done laptop

830
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,080
Yeah, I am really looking forward to putting it through its paces so far

831
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:30,920
It sounds like like it's silent and silent is a big deal for me, so I'm really happy about that and I a one thing

832
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:36,320
I may be continuing to troubleshoot, and I haven't I don't know if it's just the Wi-Fi here or what

833
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,320
But I've had a couple of Wi-Fi issues

834
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:43,640
Where the either the transfer rate has been real bad like I'm talking like I'm getting 2,000 millisecond pings

835
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:49,560
Or it just won't find the network, but I in both cases it actually could be interference

836
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:54,200
So I'm gonna take it out to a known good location where I only have one Wi-Fi access

837
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:59,200
point there's no other Wi-Fi accesses points around or access eyes and

838
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,880
See if I have any issues, but so far

839
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,480
I other than that and then with the ether adapter of course

840
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:09,800
I've had zero problems and Ubuntu Mate has been has been pretty great, too. I really like the design

841
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:14,180
It because it's a little bit smaller than the Librem it feels a little tighter

842
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,000
There's a notch where you put your finger that kind of is reminiscent of the way the Mac books do it

843
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,160
Yeah, which looks nice it really all it all comes together

844
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:29,560
It's it's it's got a bottom plate that could be removed with one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

845
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:33,920
Screws so you remove twelve little Phillips screws, and it looks like the bottom plate would come off

846
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,680
But it seems like such a good laptop like you show but a conference

847
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:43,380
And it's it's just a little different, and you've got it running Linux, and it works well. Yeah. Yeah, I really like it

848
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,200
I'm really really happy that the keys are

849
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,080
actually

850
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:52,960
The the letters are translucent so the backlit key light actually shines through the keys

851
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,780
Which is nice because otherwise it's kind of pointless to have the backlighting Mike is there anything else you want to add about the Apollo

852
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,920
Before we move on I know that's it very good sir and wimpy was there anything you wanted to add

853
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:10,840
Any thoughts I'd like to add yeah, yeah Mike's being far too modest

854
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,720
Mike has

855
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:17,360
Intro ship with a company that you'd be very interested in hearing about I think

856
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,240
Tell me more

857
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
So now partners

858
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,760
Val okay Mike now are you bearing the lead here hold on we have ourselves a little valve story

859
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,760
I got to hear it tell me about it

860
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:37,240
Yeah, so we're official valve partners, so we're gonna be building a steam machine shipping them out a few months

861
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,880
very cool I

862
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:43,880
Have you I've already begun testing come on now. Are you a gamer Mike?

863
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,320
We had one prototype

864
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,600
I'll count this year for people to use and

865
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:59,560
Got a good reaction so my you know Mike. I gotta say. I don't know a lot about entry where my

866
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,560
My initial impressions are is you guys are very clever?

867
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:09,820
So it just it just it struck me just in the name of this device

868
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:14,280
It's a pretty great device, and you went with the name Apollo

869
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:20,560
Which when I say Apollo West what's the next thing you think of fast? Oh you do well?

870
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:25,240
I don't know I think 13. I think Apollo 13. Oh 13 right and what is this?

871
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:31,080
13 inch yeah, it's a 13 inch laptop. It is it's brilliant. I mean it shows you a little bit of the

872
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:33,200
I I to me

873
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:38,120
I think it just it sort of demonstrates a little bit of the thought that goes into it is it's an Apollo

874
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,560
13 but of course the product name is just Apollo because

875
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,600
The 13 just sort of comes naturally part of it

876
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,320
And it makes you think what laptop to Chris get got that Apollo and how big was oh yeah?

877
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:52,260
I was 13 inches Apollo 13. That's clear and the 15 should be called Creed

878
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:53,960
No

879
01:06:53,960 --> 01:07:01,760
No, nothing ever gets called Creed. That's that's that has been banned, but yeah, so I I think it's pretty good kids

880
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,480
And you you had something you wanted to add to go ahead sir

881
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:10,660
When you said Apollo, I actually thought art and illumination like the

882
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:16,740
Roman slash Greek God yeah, yeah, okay, all right, okay fine not everybody thinks

883
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,080
But it does have proper backlit key so

884
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:26,200
It elimination is accurate all right, okay fine fine all those are good. See it's a clever name

885
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,200
Nothing nonetheless. It is a clever name

886
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,840
So I have if you're listening to the audio version

887
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:34,800
And you're curious what the hell does this thing look like and probably a lot of you are listening to the audio version in the show

888
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,800
notes I have a link to an album I took up up on campsite and

889
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:43,240
I posted pictures of because I was like hey, you know what you know what makes a good background for photos

890
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:48,920
The freaking Pacific Northwest yes, it does. It's a pretty good-looking state so Washington is so I put that up there

891
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:53,800
And yes, it does have a an Ubuntu button actually it's a matte button

892
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,880
So that's pretty yeah, I like seeing you can customize that right on the website. That's great. Yeah

893
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,760
Yeah, and it's a it's a sticker, but it's a translucent sticker

894
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:06,240
So it doesn't block the light which which makes that attention to detail

895
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:16,760
So I'm right now. I'm running Ubuntu Mate 1510 or mate or whatever addition on there. I may stick with that I

896
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:21,680
I I I don't I don't know what exactly it is

897
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:28,040
But this particular hardware has made me also want to just see what it'd be like to have elementary OS on it

898
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:35,160
Just to kind of go all the way. I don't know though because the thing is is right now for testing Ubuntu mate makes such a great

899
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,920
Low-key desktop environment that it's like you just get all of the machines performance out of it

900
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,160
So I just don't know about it Wimpy you had one more comment go ahead

901
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:50,360
Um, yeah, the version of Ubuntu mate that you're running there is actually sort of Ubuntu mate 1512

902
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,040
Really?

903
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,080
Yeah, yeah

904
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:59,720
So what you've got there is Ubuntu mate 1510 and then I worked with Mike to get the mate

905
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,060
1.12 desktop on there rather than mate 1.10

906
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:09,560
Did that is because in mate 1.12 we introduced

907
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,720
in the control panels

908
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:13,880
two

909
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:18,560
Finger three finger touch configuration. Yes, and I do really appreciate that

910
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:23,200
Yeah, so that's why we've just given you a slightly custom version

911
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:29,300
But so if I reloaded the OS it might I might not get the the the trackpad configuration stuff

912
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:34,640
No, the the trackpad works on all OSs sure, but Barte didn't have

913
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:39,840
The UI touch options until just recently that is it actually

914
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:44,800
exceptionally nice because so it is a good sized trackpad and when you go into the

915
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:52,000
Mouse settings in in mate you can you can say two fingers down as a right-click or in the corner is a right-click

916
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,360
I want to scroll by touching the right side of the trackpad

917
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,200
I want to scroll by using two fingers like all of that is available for you. Wow. Yeah

918
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:01,920
Really nice. So that's good to know. Yeah, I think I might stick with it

919
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,760
I I just I really have very little reason to replace it once I have it all set up

920
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,120
It really works super good. The only thing I might want to play fine. Yeah, sorry

921
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:16,260
I was gonna say you'll be fine when you go with an turgos as well cuz I know Mike runs arch. Oh, really?

922
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,560
Okay, cool there and you know

923
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:23,840
I was also thinking 16 if I all the other thing I might do is might do the 1604 version of Ubuntu Mate

924
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:29,600
Yeah, yeah and just do that because that and that would likely still have the configuration options right for my trackpad

925
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:34,720
Yeah, that's all built into 1604. Boom. Boom. I loves it. I

926
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:40,100
Have not done the distro bands bounce the chat room was asking. So yeah, but I might buy by the time

927
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,600
I buy the time last comes around

928
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,200
I think if all goes as planned this will be my review for last and we'll compare it to the to the two

929
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,720
I might try to do some performance stuff

930
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:51,360
So if anybody has any questions or or even better yet

931
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:58,400
suggestions of ways to benchmark a system like this that actually produce information that we care about and

932
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:04,680
That is relevant. I would love to know that Linux actual at reddit comm you could link the benchmarks there

933
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,680
or something like that

934
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,120
Oh

935
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:13,920
Okay, so Wimpy I will absolutely have to have Loki if I want to try it on this machine. Why is that? Yeah for elementary

936
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
elementary is based on

937
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,400
1404 right which doesn't have Skylake support

938
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,040
Right, right and Loki's based on 1604

939
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,920
Yeah

940
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:29,200
Okay. All right. Well see 15 10 or better see somebody's got to make me a Loki

941
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:34,600
I said just cuz it looks like it looks like if you here's my thinking right you put that on here

942
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:39,000
And then you go to like a mall or somewhere you say you say look at the new Macbook. What do you think?

943
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:46,720
Shriner prankster and you know before before we before we walk away and say oh, it's a big Macbook ripoff

944
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,600
I want to actually make sure I'm clear I did when I look at it

945
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,600
I actually don't give the impression that it's trying to rip off from the Macbook what I get the impression of is

946
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:01,760
Aluminum makes pretty good material for this and when you make a 13-inch machine, there's only so much room

947
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:07,000
I actually in some ways that I would say there's potential the keyboard may be better than the Macbook keyboard

948
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,440
I'm gonna type some more and tell you the truth if that's I don't know about the trackpad

949
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:16,480
But the keyboard I think might be better and this this thing with with one two three USB ports

950
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:20,840
I think outclasses the Macbook in terms of connectivity plus a

951
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:27,620
Dedicated HDMI out port and an SD card slot reader this thing might outclass the Macbook and connectivity

952
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:29,400
But I'm not I'm not sure about that

953
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:34,280
And so I don't actually I think it's I think it's selling it short to say always copying the Macbook

954
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:39,320
I think what it is. It's taking design cues from a good design, but it also I think is

955
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:44,480
Its own product very much its own product and I'm I like it a lot

956
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,560
But that is my that's my first impression if you wanted to take check out some pictures go over to the show notes

957
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:54,680
And if you got ideas on things you want me to do to test it, let me know so skylake. It's got Intel graphics

958
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,280
So we'll see what happens. We got two. We got two drives in there

959
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,080
I

960
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,520
Mean a Linux action show dot reddit calm

961
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,800
That's also where you can go to submit content for this show or any other show we do

962
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,240
We appreciate that helps sort of form what we end up talking about West

963
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:13,960
Is there anything else we want to cover in today's episode of the unplug program? I don't think so

964
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:19,540
It's been a big show today. Oh my gosh, Wes, and I got to be the fool that edits. It's all together. Oh, man

965
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:25,760
It's for people who like to mess with computers. I am NOT looking forward to that West that is that is you know

966
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,240
Maybe it just comes out later this week once Rekha

967
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:34,520
Just put it out a few days Rekha. I left all the editing for you. Yeah, that's true. Hey, mr.

968
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:41,320
Producer q5 sis got his acceptance letter for Linux fest Northwest talk. That's awesome. That is super awesome. Of course, we're grads

969
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:45,440
We're gonna we're gonna get Wes at Linux fest Northwest. Oh, we're gonna have people up

970
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:50,920
Do you guys got to be there to Linux fest Northwest org be so cool to have people from the mumble room make it to?

971
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,560
That'd be super nice. All right, check us out on Tuesdays

972
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:59,280
We do the show live Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar JB live TV to watch that Linux action show at reddit comm to send us

973
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:28,880
Feedback Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact to send us in some emails. See you back here next Tuesday

974
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:40,480
Thank you for making it in I hope the project makes it are you guys gonna push forward if it doesn't quite clear

975
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,720
What's your what do you have? Are you formulating a plan B? Yeah, we may try and do something

976
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:50,160
Um, if it doesn't quite go through we'll see what happens. Yeah, I think that's a great idea regardless

977
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:54,360
But hopefully it makes you something animation. So cute. Yeah, like I love that. Yeah, great

978
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:54,600
Yeah

979
01:14:54,600 --> 01:15:00,960
Sometimes the those crowdfunding projects break through towards the end as people get motivated so you never know. Yeah. All right

980
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,480
Cool, man. Thank you for being here

981
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:08,760
Thanks from both to me JB titles comm chat room. Everybody go boat or bang suggest comm

982
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,880
Let's pick our title it out and then we're gonna get the heck out of here

983
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:19,000
So I'm like, okay, even though this is the dumbest idea. I I should probably upgrade WordPress before I release last I

984
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:23,920
Mean cuz that's one more thing to do man. Well, and it's like well it takes a while to encode

985
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,840
So I've got like an hour here to play with and I'm like I could spend this hour upgrading my WordPress installation

986
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:31,040
And then I'm not I don't look like the world's biggest

987
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,800
Hypocrite right and even though in the show I'm like I I suffer from this problem, too

988
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,600
I just thought this would be a good idea a little follow-through. Yeah

989
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,680
And so I don't want JB to get hacked pretty solid idea a couple of things that really bit me in the ass

990
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,320
They come the compounded

991
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,000
So first of all, I had to struggle through getting final cut to work

992
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,600
Which was just a disaster required a ton of maintenance to get final cut to perform properly. I I got through that in coding

993
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,240
That's pretty solid. Not a big deal the WebM encoding a two hour and ten minute episode

994
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,080
WebM was literally going in real time

995
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:05,400
and so it basically took two hours and ten minutes to encode one WebM file which looks way worse than any of the

996
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:07,880
x264 files and is way larger and

997
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:13,360
On top of all that like getting through all the final cut problems. I decide okay. I'm gonna do this WordPress upgrade. I

998
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Do the upgrade?

999
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,120
It goes pretty solid

1000
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,680
except

1001
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,160
One of the most critical plugins we have breaks. Oh

1002
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:30,840
convert markdown to HTML and as you know Wes all of our show notes are written in markdown for all of our shows and

1003
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,540
This ability to post the shows in markdown just broke on the JB site and I'm like, okay

1004
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:39,600
I didn't I didn't need this. Nope. I don't I don't want this right now

1005
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,960
And so I start looking into well, I'll just go get a new WordPress plugin

1006
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:49,860
So I do the thing that everybody does I install like three different freaking plugins and the third plug-in. I try to activate

1007
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,420
something

1008
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,860
Happens and it just starts slamming the mysql database

1009
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:59,180
Well that takes down the whole back end of the WordPress site. And so I'm like in the chair. I'm like Alan

1010
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:04,180
Are you around Alan? No Alan. It's a Sunday afternoon. He's in Canada. I don't even know what he's doing

1011
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:07,900
He's doing so in Canadian and he's totally a he's totally afk

1012
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:13,260
The back end of the JB website is down. The files are finishing encoding as the site goes down

1013
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,020
I'm like what is going on?

1014
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:18,700
Of course the YouTube encoding is is chewing away now and I'm like come on

1015
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:22,500
I can't get this side up. Eventually the mysql server starts responding again. I

1016
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:27,740
Don't know why maybe just some sort of BSD magic. It finished deleting all of your data

1017
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:33,660
Yeah, and so I log back in still no markdown plugins turns out in the new in the new WordPress

1018
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:40,500
They want you to use jetpack and jetpack has a markdown kind of feature that you can use

1019
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:44,580
Okay. Well so to use jetpack you have to activate jetpack

1020
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:48,500
That's really so I installed the jetpack plug-in and I go to activate jetpack

1021
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:52,580
Authentication failure

1022
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:54,660
What I tried again

1023
01:17:56,100 --> 01:18:00,460
Authentication failure unable to activate what is going on? I started looking into it

1024
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:04,380
They're like, yeah, if your mysql server is running real bad and having some performance issues

1025
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:09,380
It causes enough of a delay that the sync doesn't work and you can't activate the plug-in

1026
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:12,260
So because whatever's going on with the mysql server

1027
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:17,260
I can't activate this plug-in which gives me markdown support so I can't post the show because now I need markdown support to support

1028
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:18,820
So a long story short

1029
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:24,620
I've now been manually converting markdown to HTML and just posting them shows is it which is not a big deal

1030
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:27,460
But it it's it means that we have your workflow and we have this

1031
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:33,520
Mismatch of stump some stuff in markdown and some stuff in HTML and it's just you don't go have a canonical copy

1032
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:35,740
Yeah, so now he's gonna now he's gonna have to go fix that

1033
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:40,620
I love you. Okay
