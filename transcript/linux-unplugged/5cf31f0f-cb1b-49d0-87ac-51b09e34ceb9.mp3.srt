1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Well, that's a good question. So Wimpy, how could somebody who's just getting started in computer science help on projects like Ubuntu Mate?

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:23,400
Oh, wow. Um, Ubuntu Mate is a bad project to pick because I have been very tardy and actually preparing the how to contribute page, which has been a work in progress for months and months and months. Other projects have better how to contribute pages.

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Um, some of the ways that you can contribute, um, translations, if you're, um, one of these lucky people that speaks and reads, writes more than one language, translations are always extremely welcome. Um, so, you know, that doesn't necessarily require, um, computer science skills.

4
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,000
But what if they want to get their hands on the code? They want to, they want to, you know, code stuff.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Um, the best thing to do in that respect is to find, um, where the developers for that project are talking to one another. In some cases, that might be an IRC channel, it might be slack or hip chat, or, you know, one of these live chat environments that will certainly be mentioned on the website somewhere.

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And the best thing to do is go to that place, introduce yourself, explain that you would like to get involved and, uh, maybe ask if there are any particular bugs that, um, either just need triaging to start with, as in there's a bug has been raised.

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Can you provide some more information? Can you reproduce the issue reliably? Um, and start to get familiar with code base.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Be helpful there. That would be really helpful. Yep. Uh, make yourself known, be helpful. And by doing things like that, you get familiar with, because for example, Marte is a relatively small desktop project.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I think there's about, um, 40 components, something like that, that make up the desktop, you know, compare that with KDE where there's about 300 components.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So, um, it takes some time to actually learn what each of the components are, what its function is and how they interact. And as you start to learn that, then you can start to understand, uh, how you can help improve specific areas.

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So we've had somebody join, uh, Marte probably six or seven months ago as a sort of a regular contributor, and they are primarily looking after just one of the applications in the Marte desktop suite, rather than trying to get involved in everything.

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:41,000
They've got an interest in making, um, and grandpa, which is the archive manager better focusing on that area. So you could pick, you know, a, a component within the, within the suite of tools that you are interested in most of all, and just focus on that.

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Um, because once you learn one area of the system, the rest tend to be similarly architected. I mean, I know that's true of, um, Gnome and Marte and KDE. Um, I can't speak to the other so much cause I've, I've not really looked at the code so much, but certainly find the developers where they're hanging out and join them there and have a conversation.

14
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I liked all your advice. I think a lot of times hard stuff is you should break a project that you're actively using so that you can maintain interest in it because a lot of times, like what you're saying, the biggest thing is just getting familiar with everything, learning one, how do I get everything up so I can even make code changes and submit them properly to, you know, find the things.

15
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And then when you do find bugs that either you've found or you want to fix with other things that you have the resources and you've already knocked down all those barriers, you know, who the right people to ask questions are, all of that. So when you're, you know, in a couple, in a year when you're like, Hey, I really want to make this go change. You have all the tools to do it.

16
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Those are great points. Yeah. Solve problems, get engaged and go to where they're at. And I think your point of sticking with something that you're passionate about. So that way you remain committed and have an interest.

17
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's like documentation is a great way to do it. But if you don't use something, it's pretty hard to go improve docs. But if you're using it every day and you're like, wow, these docs could really be better. Here's the ways that I like it. Here's how it becomes much more natural.

18
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah.

19
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah. And some projects are looking for people that are interested in setting up continuous integration. You know, there's more and more of a shift to that now. You definitely see that from the DevOps scene and you're seeing it more on, you know, desktop and application development now.

20
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And you know, some projects just simply don't have the resources to do that stuff. So actually becoming a really valuable QA engineer in automating a lot of that work can be extremely valuable to the project.

21
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So it's the same as in the real world. You start out in QA and then you'll...

22
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
In some cases, helping build systems like that might not even require code initially. It could just be systems engineering.

23
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Configuration.

24
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Configuration.

25
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Indeed.

26
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And you don't even have to be a developer to contribute that.

27
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah. When I started with Marte, I was just doing packaging. I didn't do any code at all until a long time in before I had the time and the interest to really get involved. I was just doing packaging. And of course, that teaches you a lot about how the system works because you're actually, you know, stitching them together to make it all run.

28
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 184 for February 14th, 2017.

29
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's going to change Android for you forever. And that's just us getting warmed up. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes. I am pumped about today's show.

30
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We got a good one and it's right before the beard apocalypse strikes Jupiter broadcast. There may be no network next week. Yeah, just like the mighty salmon. Just like the mighty salmon, the beard streams upstream, returns to main once a year.

31
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's a little snowier, less water, more snow. I think it's way more snow. Yeah, maybe, maybe. But the beard, I mean, it'll freeze in place and protect him. Less hipsters, which allows him to recharge and refortify, which is really what he needs.

32
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And less flannel, I believe. I'm led to believe. Coming up on this week's show, we're going to get into some big news that's breaking today as we go on the air. Then we're going to discuss the sleeper desktop environment that came out of nowhere.

33
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's apparently legit, ready to go. We're going to talk about our future plans and some upcoming events. Then getting into some really interesting ways of ripping Google's Play services out of your Android device, but not sacrificing the apps that require those APIs.

34
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And perhaps integrating the whole thing with F-Droid, that open source app store. We'll tell you about that. Then we'll dig into the state of snaps across different distributions.

35
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Then, I'm so excited about this, we'll dig into takeover.sh, a shell script that will wipe and reinstall a running Linux system via SSH. Then we'll tangent off into the Depenguinator, which our own Mr. Alan Jude, I believe, has had a role in this monster that is wiping out Linux systems and replacing them with FreeBSD.

36
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What?

37
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll tell you about this scandal later on in the show. Then last but not freaking least at all, and I hope William is able to stick around for this part too, Mr. Wes over here has been playing around with WireGuard, the fast, modern, secure VPN tunnel, which if I recall from our previous coverage, has that fancy asset of the fact that it's built into the Linux kernel to some extent.

38
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There's a module or some kernel component, right? It is a kernel module that will hopefully be upstream soon.

39
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
So, we'll talk about that. Also, the coverage it recently got, how Wes' experience went. So that is a hell of a lot of show. I ran out of music. I ran out of music, Wes.

40
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So before we can get into any of that, you know what we've got to do. We've got to say time-appropriate greetings to our virtual log. Hello, Mumble Room.

41
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hello. Hello.

42
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hello, everybody. Good to have you here today. I wanted to start with some really up-and-front breaking news, big stuff that I think everybody has heard about at this point, I suspect.

43
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I have no idea what it means for things like Wire and Jitsi and other services, but Amazon has announced Chime.

44
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We used to work like this, and it was easy.

45
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They're in an office.

46
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But then things got more complicated.

47
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The internet, time zones, it's hard.

48
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And we started to work like this.

49
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I guess that's...

50
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But it was obvious that there were some problems.

51
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Over the internet.

52
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Can anyone else hear Susan?

53
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
AWS was down, so...

54
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We had to deal with this...

55
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Hello.

56
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And this...

57
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Just one sec here. Let me see if I can find it.

58
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You know, I'm not at my desk right now. Can I call you back in a couple minutes?

59
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And a whole lot of this.

60
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
A couple things I wanted to add to that. I think someone else just joined us. Who was that?

61
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But now we have this.

62
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Amazon Chime turns this...

63
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Into this.

64
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Everybody, thanks for taking the time to check in.

65
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It frees us up to be mobile with seamless notifications, synced chats, and frustration-free meetings.

66
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hello, everyone.

67
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So this is a big play here.

68
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This is like taken on GoToMeeting, it's taken on Skype, it's taken on Office...

69
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I forget what the Office...

70
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What's Microsoft?

71
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Microsoft has like the...

72
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Is it Yammer?

73
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Link.

74
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Link, yes, thank you.

75
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's taken on all of these.

76
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And obviously running on top of the AWS infrastructure.

77
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's called Amazon Chime.

78
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And I don't think it's open source, gentlemen.

79
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Which is kind of disappointing in the age of WebRTC.

80
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yes. Yes, it is.

81
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And there's no Linux client as yet.

82
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What is this?

83
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What year is this, Amazon?

84
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's an interesting, obvious play for like the corporate enterprise.

85
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, it definitely is.

86
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We'll see if it takes off.

87
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't think it's really taking on like what we do.

88
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No, I don't think so either.

89
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And there's like a...

90
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You know, it seems very...

91
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't know how customer...

92
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I have not played with it yet.

93
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But it doesn't seem like quite what we want, what were the problems we're trying to solve.

94
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But I could see it for like, hey, I want to have a conference of these people.

95
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We need to discuss this subject for this length of time.

96
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah.

97
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They run it on their existing infrastructure.

98
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
They're going to use like...

99
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
They're going to have some of the features that some of the nicer Google Hangout features like

100
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
when there's excessive noise, it can maybe automatically mute somebody, has a clear roster.

101
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So I saw other people asking this question, but why didn't Hangouts do this already?

102
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, I mean, Hangouts has been kind of doing this, but people also sort of...

103
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It seems like there's been no innovation there.

104
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah, you're right.

105
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And it seems like what people do for business is they back their way into Hangouts.

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They kind of make it work for them.

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And Hangouts says, you know, they have some apps and stuff like that.

108
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But they definitely haven't put a dent in GoToMeeting like this will.

109
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know.

110
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm just...

111
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So they also have that AWS, like you get like a virtual desktop in the cloud product.

112
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

113
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Maybe your startup and just your whole thing.

114
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're hosted there.

115
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Your desktops are there.

116
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Geez.

117
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You just give people like Chromebooks or...

118
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
With some Amazon cloud storage.

119
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Cloud storage.

120
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Fire tablets.

121
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Echoes in every room.

122
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
God, dude.

123
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh, and of course, Dash buttons.

124
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That way they can order office supplies with a touch of a button.

125
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
All automatable with our friend.

126
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And soon arriving via drone.

127
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Wow.

128
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah, they really are doing it all, aren't they?

129
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Huh.

130
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Wait and see.

131
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We will regret this day.

132
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You watch.

133
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We will regret the...

134
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We will regret the Internet Walmart that we have created one day.

135
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But in the meantime, let's get back to more Linux-y things.

136
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Things that are soundly in our wheelhouse.

137
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is something that passed over me this week.

138
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And it didn't really land on me appropriately.

139
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This is a new Linux desktop environment.

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What?

141
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What?

142
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

143
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is a new desktop environment inspired by your good friend,

144
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
your old buddy, Windows 7.

145
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It was forked from Matei to create something, they say,

146
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
better suited for their needs.

147
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Who's they?

148
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Ubuntu Chillin', which is something we've talked about a little bit in the past.

149
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's an official Chinese language spin of Ubuntu.

150
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It aims to provide a simpler and more enjoyable experience for browsing,

151
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
searching, and managing your computer.

152
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Boy, it looks kind of spot on there.

153
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm impressed.

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I am shocked that they've even made it this far this quickly.

155
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
They've really got a Windows 7 look here.

156
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I mean, it really looks like Windows 7.

157
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I remember screenshots of the old UI.

158
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It was much more cartoony.

159
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And this new one, geez, they've really got close here.

160
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So they have plans afoot to ship it as a default desktop in Ubuntu Chillin' 17.04,

161
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
due in April.

162
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I wanted to ask Wimpy what he knew about this.

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And also specifically, I noted that they said they forked it from Matei.

164
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Is this, Wimpy, to your knowledge, is this a full-on fork of Matei?

165
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Not everything in Matei, no.

166
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
They've forked some of the core components, really, for namespacing reasons.

167
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And this is so, if you look at some of the screenshots,

168
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and even if you like, you can use the PPAs on 16.10 and 17.04,

169
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and actually run this stuff up,

170
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
you'll see that some of the applications have really had their looks changed radically.

171
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So they need to fork those things,

172
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
because we're not going to change Kaja to look exactly like Windows Explorer, for example,

173
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
which, if you look at the screenshots, it's a very convincing replica.

174
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
So in order to do those big style changes and fork,

175
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
they then need to change some of the underlying namespaces.

176
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And it looks like they've gone to quite a bit of effort to make sure that Matei,

177
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
and it's called UKUI, this new project, can co-exist.

178
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
UKUI.

179
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Ubuntu Kiling user interface, I think it's short for.

180
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Not Chillin'?

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, Chillin' is the distro, so Ubuntu Chillin' is the distribution, the flavor.

182
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's not confusing at all.

183
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So Chillin', for those of you that don't know, is spelled how?

184
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
K-Y-L-I-N.

185
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, okay. And Kiling is spelled...

186
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm mispronouncing it. I'm mispronouncing Kiling.

187
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So Kiling is actually pronounced Chillin'.

188
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, okay. All right. Well, good.

189
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Because otherwise my mind was going to melt wimpy.

190
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I couldn't handle it.

191
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Too much.

192
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Do you see the steam coming up?

193
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh, yes.

194
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He's done. The show's over. Sorry, guys.

195
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We got to go.

196
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
All right. So have you had a chance to dig around this project at all?

197
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It doesn't sound like it's...

198
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I did.

199
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Okay.

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, I had a little poke around their GitHub repos last night.

201
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Because until yesterday I hadn't heard about this at all.

202
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I saw the bug turn up in the issue tracker in Ubuntu for packaging requests.

203
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Yesterday morning.

204
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And I sort of did a double take.

205
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah.

206
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
When it was like the first line is it's forked from Marte.

207
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I was like, really?

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What? Yeah.

209
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This is a third generation fork now because it was Gnome 2, it was Marte.

210
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And now we've got another fork from it.

211
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's like children.

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.

213
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And I didn't have time to really look at it until the evening.

214
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
But yeah, they've forked, I don't know, maybe a dozen components, something like that.

215
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:30,000
All the core stuff, things to do with keyboard handling, session management, the settings daemon and then policy kit and the file manager and a few bits like that.

216
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
They've obviously got their own super sexy Windows 7-esque theme that sits on top of it all.

217
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Very aero.

218
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yeah.

219
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And then they've got a couple of new components.

220
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So they've changed the panel a bit and they've used a new panel applet to do the indicator integration, which I'm going to take a closer look at because that looks quite tidy.

221
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It really does.

222
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And that could be reused in Ubuntu Marte, for example.

223
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So I want to have a closer look at that.

224
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And they've also taken so there's mint menu, which I forked as Marte menu and they forked again as UK UI menu.

225
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But they've absolutely stripped it back to like the bare essentials.

226
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, really?

227
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
And yeah, and that looks quite interesting as well because we've obviously got Brisk now, which has just entered the scene for Marte.

228
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And this is another menu that is more efficient than Marte menu and mint menu and has search capabilities, but some of the traditional categorization.

229
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So there's a couple of interesting things that have come out of this that we'll have to take a closer look at.

230
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Cool.

231
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Earlier today.

232
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah.

233
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So earlier today I reached out to that team and basically said, you know, come and introduce yourselves to the Marte developers.

234
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We'd certainly be interested in talking to you and also to see if we can maybe reduce the forking effort.

235
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You know, maybe there are things we can do in Marte to accommodate what they need to do so they don't have to fork as much stuff.

236
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And that way we get more developers looking at the same code rather than independent streams.

237
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
So we'll see if anything comes of that.

238
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We'll just have to have to wait and see.

239
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But I hope so.

240
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What a random development.

241
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
This is totally on my radar.

242
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
How the open source kind of crosses borders here and brings diverse communities together.

243
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yeah, right. Because this has been this is a Chinese, primarily Chinese development.

244
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This was this was random to me until I spoke to one of the guys I work with and he explained some of the history and said that they'd been talking.

245
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The Chilean team had been talking about creating a Windows-esque environment for some time.

246
00:17:47,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And it sounds as though they did it earlier in the year or later last year because I believe this was like a preview session you could log into on 1610.

247
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And now they're making a push to make it the default for 1704.

248
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And it seems to me that I would guess that the idea here is you're trying to maybe reach out to potential Windows 7 and 10 pirates and say,

249
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
here's a legitimate operating system you could install.

250
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It functions much like you would expect.

251
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think also there's a reluctance probably to continue to follow Windows 10 and the future versions of Windows outside of Western countries.

252
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So this seems like it could perfectly fill that niche.

253
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Yeah.

254
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Or actually not even a niche.

255
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's not a niche at all.

256
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's the opposite of a niche.

257
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What I was told is that in China, people want to use Windows.

258
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's what they're familiar with.

259
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And some of the computers that are sold with Ubuntu Chilin pre-installed, there are reports that people are just taking their hooky copy of Windows and wiping over it and putting Windows back on it.

260
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I've heard that too.

261
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Because Unity is a bit of a departure from the way Windows 7 looks and operates.

262
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Right.

263
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And you may remember relocating the Unity 7 launcher to the bottom of the screen.

264
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That actually came from the Chilin project.

265
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That was their contribution to try and make Unity more Windows-like.

266
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And so they've just taken it further now.

267
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
They're going for a far more Windows look and feel type desktop arrangement.

268
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It sounds like if your user base is hooked on the Windows UI sauce, you've got to make more sauce.

269
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So you're saying, no, I'll be using this.

270
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yeah.

271
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I think it could be a double-edged sword though, because if it looks like something that it isn't, if it looks like Windows, there's the expectation it will work like Windows.

272
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And then the frustrations will set in when that isn't the case.

273
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Perhaps.

274
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I think it has to be managed quite carefully, those expectations.

275
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Do you suppose they're rolling the dice that if you give them a web browser and a couple of decent things to do locally, that's going to meet the majority of the needs?

276
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yeah, I'd be guessing.

277
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
But until I get to speak to them, I can't really say what their thoughts are.

278
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But yeah, it looks like they're trying to appease those people that want something that works like Windows by giving them something far closer to that.

279
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Did you get a sense at all of what version of Mete they forked from?

280
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah, when I wrote in the issue tracker earlier, it wasn't clear to me how they'd forked, because the way they forked this is a little bit unusual.

281
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And in fact, ironically, it's the same unusual way that Mete was forked originally way, way back when that was forked from Gnome 2.

282
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So I think what they've done is they've actually taken what are called the Debian source packages, either from the Ubuntu archive or from one of my PPAs.

283
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And I was concerned that they'd actually forked the GTK2 builds, but I had a closer look earlier and they have actually forked from GTK3.

284
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh good, that was where I was going.

285
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But the problem here is that they've forked from the Debian source packages and then committed those to Git.

286
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So there's no Git history, so we can't see precisely where they've branched from our stuff, which means that if we want to cherry pick bits and pieces from their project to ours or vice versa, that then is a bit more complicated.

287
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So that's a bit unfortunate, but that ship sailed now, so we just have to get over that.

288
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Well, I'll have a link in the show notes if you are listening and want to check it out.

289
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I think you can also download it, it looks like, because a Joey did over at OMG Ubuntu downloaded it.

290
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah, there's an ISO image, or if you've got an Ubuntu, I think it's 16.10 or 17.04, maybe both, there's a PPA as well.

291
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That might even be a better way to go.

292
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Quick question guys, I'm assuming that there's an English build of Qilin, right, and let's say if you were to try to give it to a stereotypical Windows 7 user, they would probably pretty much easily be able to adapt to it?

293
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yeah.

294
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What are some explanations as to what's going on?

295
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I think that's kind of the idea, because if you look at the article, I'll have a link in the show notes, it's all in English.

296
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The only caution there is that Ubuntu Qilin itself is default Chinese language, so if you download Ubuntu Qilin, it's Chinese until you tell it you want a different language.

297
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So just be aware of that, you just need to be able to spot your language and go with it.

298
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Do you think we'd be able to get into the source code for the Iceland to change the default language to English?

299
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Or if you add it as a PPA, just add it as a PPA to your existing list.

300
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That then picks up the local and regional settings you've already configured.

301
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I saw one of the Linux YouTubers had actually done an install of the PPA over the top of Marte, so I'll ping you a link for that a little bit later, because he's sort of given it a run through.

302
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Very good.

303
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
If I remember, I will drop a link in the show notes.

304
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So that's interesting, and if you hear anything more about it, let us know.

305
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, will do.

306
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Wimpy's now on the beat, Wes, you like that?

307
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Oh, yes I do.

308
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Thank you, Wimpy.

309
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:36,000
All right, so Wes, you found a series of links that could be fundamentally a game changer for Android users in the audience.

310
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
You can effectively use Android without Google Play services.

311
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Now don't get too excited, this is kind of like a multi-part solution, so buckle up, we're not quite there yet.

312
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But imagine a world in where this has sort of been smoothed out, and it's really kind of simple.

313
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So I personally have experimented a while trying to use Android without Google Play services,

314
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
and while this article sort of points out the security reasons why you wouldn't want to use Google Play,

315
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I walked away realizing that I got like a day and a half to two day battery life improvement when I didn't use Google Play services on the Nexus phone.

316
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So that alone almost made me not want to.

317
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And custom ROMs like LineageOS proposed by default that Google Play services free version be an optimal installation

318
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and then make Google Play services like a secondary option you choose.

319
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So that's sort of where Momentum is at right now.

320
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
A major drawback when you don't have Google Play services installed is you cannot use any of the official Google applications

321
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
like the Google Play app to install more apps.

322
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
But of course, F-Droid is out there, it's not really full of everything you might want,

323
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:48,000
but it does have a lot of good apps like K9 Mail, Firefox, Nextcloud, TTRSS Reader, and lots of other ones.

324
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But check this out, Wes, check this out.

325
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The author of this post was experimenting around and came across a project, an open source project called G Play Web.

326
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
G Play Web allows you to easily download applications from Google Play with a simple response of WebEye.

327
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It uses G Play CI, an unofficial library to download applications from Google Play.

328
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I think it's like using like Docker in the background and all kinds of stuff.

329
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I didn't read that far into it because that wasn't the part that I cared about.

330
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
This is the part I cared about.

331
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
He says, I forked this project on GitHub to use the latest version of G Play CLI and F-Droid server.

332
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So now I can easily install, oh yeah, he says he published it as a Docker.

333
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Okay, yeah, so he does have it out there as a Docker.

334
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
So now with this kind of tool, you have a web interface to easily download applications from Google Play

335
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
and then an optional integration into the F-Droid app which creates custom F-Droid repositories

336
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
to install and update more applications as you need them.

337
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
So suddenly, through F-Droid, you can install Google Play apps.

338
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Yeah, because you're running G Play CLI on a Docker image.

339
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Maybe up on a droplet or something in Docker.

340
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Sure, and then it's creating this private repository for you.

341
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
So that solves the Play Store without having Google Play.

342
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You should note that it only works because the G Play web is backed by G Play CLI.

343
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
That only supports free, gratis applications.

344
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So if you have some apps that you paid for that you need, maybe it won't work.

345
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah, and it's not a complete solution for a couple of other huge reasons too

346
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
because it doesn't provide the Play API, which a ton of these applications, once you install them,

347
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
expect, like Google's own applications.

348
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So when I read that, I was like, man, this is great because it makes it available for us to get a lot more software

349
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
from the Play Store, and a lot of the apps I use from the Play Store are honestly free.

350
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And maybe they have like an in-app purchase or something.

351
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So that was like, okay, all right, well this is cool.

352
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
It's not quite there yet.

353
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You could do it yourself if you're up for it, but you only get the apps angle.

354
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
You still need the API angle.

355
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Ho hum.

356
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
And then that's when I saw Wes's link for Micro G,

357
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
a free as in freedom re-implementation of Google's proprietary Android user space apps and libraries.

358
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Now we're starting to get closer to replacing the Play API.

359
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Have no illusion, it's not a complete replacement.

360
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Let me break this down for you.

361
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Most Micro G components are far from complete,

362
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
so even the ones it does support are far from complete.

363
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The users are amazed by the results, though, they say.

364
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Free software users got to extend application support.

365
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Privacy-carrying users are able to reduce or monitor data that's sent to Google.

366
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Because you have control over this stuff, you could put interesting monitoring in the middle of it.

367
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That's fascinating.

368
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
This could be great for security research.

369
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And they say also older phone users are reporting dramatic better battery life.

370
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh, wow.

371
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Micro G is not only used on real devices, but also replaces Google tools in test emulators.

372
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah, that's interesting.

373
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Very interesting.

374
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So right now it offers GMS core.

375
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's a library app providing the functionality required to run apps that use the Google Play services

376
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
or Google Maps API version 2.

377
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Wow.

378
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Wow.

379
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Full stop wow right there.

380
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
They also have the service framework proxy.

381
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
It's a smaller help utility to allow apps developed for Google Cloud device messaging

382
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
to use the compatible Google Cloud messaging service included with GMS core.

383
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
So they're taking care of the messaging angle, too.

384
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Huge, huge.

385
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Unified network location provider is a library that provides Wi-Fi and cell tower-based geolocation

386
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
to applications that use Google's network location provider.

387
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Nice.

388
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm just blown away.

389
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Maps API is a system library providing the same functionality as now depreciated Google Maps API 1.

390
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
And Store is a front-end application providing access to Google Play Store to download and update applications,

391
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
which development is in the early stage and there's no usable application yet.

392
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But they're working on it.

393
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Now you combine the F-Droid combo thing which you're using the G Play CLI to download.

394
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Actually get the apps.

395
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
And F-Droid to manage them on your phone and update them and also install great open source apps.

396
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Then Micro G to replace the Google Play API stuff and the location stuff.

397
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
This is a huge development I think.

398
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Two separate or three separate projects, right?

399
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Three separate or four separate projects?

400
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
A lot of separate projects here.

401
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
If you look at the individual like G Play CLI stuff and G Play Web.

402
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
A lot of moving pieces.

403
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
It's interesting.

404
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I think there's still also there's obviously problems with the Android ROM.

405
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Anytime you're getting away from Google's upstream then do you lose the benefits of the monthly patches if you do have those kinds of things?

406
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah.

407
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
There's a lot of good questions.

408
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But it also seems like there's a lot of opportunities to monitor applications and how they use the API and how it behaves and what kind of information it's exposing and sending.

409
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Even if it's not you and I who are using this.

410
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It seems like there is a lot of useful things on the edges for researchers or developers.

411
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But it also makes it feel like maybe something like LineageOS with no Google Play services by default a year down the road could be a really feasible option for those of us who want a day more of battery life and don't want Google tracking us constantly.

412
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But we'd need Android for work or you know like Popeye's come on and said yeah I have to have Android because my bank only makes an Android app and that's how I have to interact with them.

413
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
There's a lot of people that have that story.

414
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
This would be amazing.

415
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Super excited about this.

416
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,000
This is like the big discovery of the week for me is that we really could be getting there and I didn't think that we would be able to do this.

417
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It felt like unachievable.

418
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Maybe it will always be a race against Google but wow Wes.

419
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Well I think there's another component here that we need if we're going to have going to have Android playing a little bit better.

420
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Was that.

421
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Well what do we do about the carrier.

422
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You know that's a good point.

423
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That's a damn good point.

424
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You got to go to Ting make the whole package Linux dot Ting dot com.

425
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Not like any other carrier.

426
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
If you if you if you want to play that in that game sure you go over there you sign up for a duopoly.

427
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
You can play that.

428
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Here's the problem.

429
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Once you even start getting a plan you're all you're already is part of the system is too late.

430
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
A plan is never going to work for you because there's going to be months where you didn't need all those minutes.

431
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
There's going to be months where you needed more minutes or megabytes or messages.

432
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I know for me I've never ever ever once in the years in years sent more than 10 text messages a month because I do everything over every other messaging platform that uses data.

433
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I don't I do not use text messages except for very rare alerts or like authorizing places to fly with my drone.

434
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Like that's what I use text messages for.

435
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So this kind of stuff is this is where they get you in Ting is different thing is you only pay for what you use.

436
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's six dollars for the line and then your usage on top of that.

437
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Now imagine a scenario where you have family members you want to have multiple accounts or you are a small business and you want to have multiple lines.

438
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Six dollars for each line.

439
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
No other carrier can match that.

440
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That is an unbeatable price and you only pay for what you use.

441
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So if you have Wi-Fi in the house and in your office why would you pay for data when you're not using it.

442
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It doesn't make any sense.

443
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
They've tricked you into it and Ting is doing it differently and they match that with incredible customer service.

444
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
You speak to a real human being.

445
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
They've got a great dashboard and apps to manage your account.

446
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You can turn devices off.

447
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You can set limits and alerts.

448
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
It's so nice.

449
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I really appreciate that.

450
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
And then I think the favorite thing for Ting when I'm traveling.

451
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
My favorite thing when I'm on the road is the fact that they have CDMA and GSM services.

452
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And I bring one of each because it's six dollars and I need to be connected.

453
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It's part of my business.

454
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I might have business papers I've got to take care of.

455
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So I need that.

456
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Six dollars a month for a CDMA line and a GSM line.

457
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That's my no brainer.

458
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
You want to call in that hamburger order.

459
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
How are you going to do it?

460
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
How am I going to listen into how you and Nor are screwing up the show if I don't have connectivity when I'm on the road.

461
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I love you guys.

462
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Also I think Ting is pretty cool with this whole Ring Plus situation.

463
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
There's a lot of Ring Plus shenanigans going down.

464
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Things are falling apart and Ting has swept in and they're really hooking people up.

465
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
And you can read about it on their blog.

466
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It just shows what a great company they are.

467
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Check it out.

468
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Go to linux.ting.com.

469
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
And also while you're there, even if you're not ready to sign up yet, why not read the blog.

470
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Lots of good stuff there for cord cutters too.

471
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Linux.ting.com.

472
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And thanks to Ting for sponsoring the unplugged program.

473
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Thank you very, very much.

474
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
All right.

475
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
It's that time of the year when we've got big events coming up.

476
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Scale is very soon.

477
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Noah will be down at scale.

478
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Wow.

479
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
So soon.

480
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That's awesome.

481
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And I think we'll do last live from there.

482
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
He'll do last live from there.

483
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'll be back here at the studio.

484
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And then shortly after that, Linux Fest Northwest 2017 is going on.

485
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Linux Fest is the show that's always the kind of the one we go all in at every year because it's here in our backyard.

486
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
We love the folks that run it.

487
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It's in Bellingham, Washington, May 6 and the 7th.

488
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,000
And the thread was started by Sidley09.

489
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
The subreddit says, is last going to go to Linux Fest Northwest?

490
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yes.

491
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Last will be.

492
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Last will be there for two days.

493
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
We'll be live both two days like we always are.

494
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Nice.

495
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
We'll have a good crew there.

496
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
You're going to make it, right, Wes?

497
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Oh, yeah.

498
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I love it.

499
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And we always have a good time.

500
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's an awesome time.

501
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm going to bring Lady Joups up there.

502
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Nice.

503
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'll have the lady up there.

504
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
We'll have Noah in town.

505
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Angela will be there to say hi to everybody.

506
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
We'll probably have to swag.

507
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
There's always a ton of awesome booths.

508
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
We'll do a live show on Sunday from there of the Linux action show.

509
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I've always loved that people come by and watch the show live.

510
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
That's the real live experience.

511
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's a real treat.

512
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
We basically only do it once a year in front of a group, so it's a good place to catch it.

513
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And plus, the other thing that's really great about it, if you're going to make the trip out,

514
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Washington is remarkably beautiful.

515
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
The Pacific Northwest in general is very beautiful.

516
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And Bellingham is very eclectic.

517
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's very Washington in a lot of different ways.

518
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And so if you're going to come out here and you don't necessarily want to be in the crazy downtown Seattle area,

519
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
but you still want to get a good taste of Washington, Bellingham is a very unique way to do it.

520
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Would you agree?

521
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Oh, absolutely.

522
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yeah.

523
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So it's a fun town.

524
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's worth traveling to.

525
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And I've got to be honest, it probably wouldn't be on your destination list otherwise,

526
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
and you would be missing out.

527
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
So check it out.

528
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Linuxfestnorthwest.org if you're going to be there.

529
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
And I will link to the thread in the subreddit if you guys want to throw in.

530
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Oh, and he was asking about where to stay.

531
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,000
If you go to linuxfest.org, slash 2017, slash travel, they have an area map with the hotels.

532
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Book soon because they do fill up.

533
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
And for the JB crew, we'll be getting that all figured out here in the next couple of weeks too.

534
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So, yes, there's three really, none very close to Linuxfest.

535
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And don't bring your RV because that's my gig.

536
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Don't do that.

537
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
He's got tips, everyone.

538
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Anybody in the Bomba Room making plans to come out to Linuxfest Northwest?

539
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I would like to try and make it this year.

540
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
That would be awesome.

541
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Yeah, I'm really hoping.

542
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Wimpy, that's one of the reasons I'm most excited about this year is I'm hoping you're making it.

543
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I think you would really like it.

544
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
And I think anybody that hasn't gone to an event like this,

545
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
even if you've gone to like corporate events, this is very unique.

546
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
It's very welcoming.

547
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
It's nearly 2,000 people, but it's at a large college campus, so there's space for everybody.

548
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's not like it's awkward.

549
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It can get a little busy in the main event room, but I've seen a lot worse too.

550
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And they have on-location barbecuing that they do usually,

551
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
but there's also tons of really great food nearby.

552
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
And it's a great feel because the whole event is put on by the Bellingham Linux Users Group.

553
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
So it's not like it's some big commercial interest.

554
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's not like a company that they make profit from events.

555
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It is the Bellingham Linux Users Group who has been working with the Bellingham Technical College now for years,

556
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
working together to host this event,

557
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
and it has gotten large enough that it brings in large companies like Microsoft and Red Hat

558
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
and sometimes Canonical and Hardware Management, lots of big companies, which you see in our coverage.

559
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:40,000
But it still retains the roots of there's a lot of sessions to go to that are really well-run,

560
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
that are hosted by people that are authoritative on the topics.

561
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Oh yeah, the sessions are great.

562
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And the whole thing has this very chill, relaxed feel to it because the Bellingham guys are just pretty chill guys.

563
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
People are just hanging out, talking about Linux, sharing stories.

564
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So you get this really good mix of high-end vendors and speakers.

565
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Also, this has been a long-running event.

566
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So you get this high-end mix that you normally would only get at California events or a New York event,

567
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
really large events, but you get it here in a field that is more laid back and more community-driven.

568
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
So they really nail it.

569
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Plus, Bellingham's got a lot of good breweries, so if that's your angle.

570
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Yeah, they got a lot of good, a lot of things.

571
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
They got a lot of good, a lot of things.

572
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That's what I'll just say to that. They really do.

573
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So yeah, check it out at Linux Fest.

574
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I don't have to go on and on about it, but the question has been raised and the answer is yes, we will be there.

575
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
We will be there live.

576
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
They should do what Katie Easton and get you to narrate one of their ads.

577
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Yeah, they should have ads.

578
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
They also have the Linux Game Den, the Robotics Lab, the Arduino Hacking Lab,

579
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
and every now and then, depending on the brewers, they also have a Linux Beer Brewery Lab.

580
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
It kind of comes and goes depending on their schedule, but they have an automated brewing process running on Linux.

581
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And if they're there again this year, I am definitely getting another interview.

582
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And I'm going to ask where the hell their brewery is at so I can go there.

583
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Because I run into them every other year.

584
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,000
In fact, one year, they had a booth right next to our booth with the beer.

585
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And I don't know if they were supposed to be handing out beer, but I mean, somebody had beer

586
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and somebody was passing that beer on to me in little sippy cups over and over and over again while I was on the air.

587
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Just to help the broadcast.

588
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And it is delicious. What are you going to do? It's delicious.

589
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Well, I mean, if it's brewed by Linux.

590
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
It's super local, right? It's home batch, small batch, homegrown.

591
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So you can check out their travel page too, which I will link.

592
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Wes, I'm going to drop this in the IRC.

593
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Will you link the travel page specifically in the show nizzles?

594
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So that way folks listening that think they might make it can find it.

595
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
All right. Then one other thing, just super quick from the subreddit.

596
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:59,000
It looks like that whole Munich is dumping Linux and switching back to Windows.

597
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Will they? Won't they?

598
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Well, now we're back on the they won't.

599
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
This is unbelievable. It's the soap opera over here.

600
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And I got to just put a big disclaimer.

601
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
We prerecorded the episode of Linux Action Show where we talk about this news story.

602
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And this hadn't come out yet.

603
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And what this is, is not necessarily the whole thing is off.

604
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But that the motion to discuss it has moved.

605
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And so it's not necessarily on like they thought it was.

606
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
So anyways, the correction is in the subreddit.

607
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And I wanted to make a big errata correction now.

608
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Because in the future, you will hear an episode of Linux Action Show where we talk about this situation.

609
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And we talk about it without this context.

610
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Go figure. Go figure.

611
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That never happens.

612
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Nope. Never.

613
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
The whole Munich thing is...

614
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Hopefully by the time that airs, they've flopped back the other way.

615
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And then you'll be right.

616
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
You know, I would just like them to switch.

617
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Just get it over with.

618
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Whatever you're going to do, do it.

619
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Just cut it off.

620
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Just go to Windows. Go spend a ton of money.

621
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Go be wrong for a few years so we can stop talking about it.

622
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I'm so sick of it.

623
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But yeah, part of the reason the confusion here is because the news comes out and it's not in English.

624
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So there's a lot of translation happening.

625
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And the translation is sometimes wrong.

626
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:19,000
And so thankfully, I think it was Clause4040 in the subreddit who was able to do some translation for us.

627
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
And also to ChemBrotron who was following this closely and did some source linking for us.

628
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And interestingly, one of the things he linked has now been pulled down.

629
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
But I really appreciate it.

630
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And they got 98 upvotes on the subreddit.

631
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So I wanted to make sure, yes, we saw it.

632
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Hot news.

633
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That's right. Hot news.

634
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Okay.

635
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So before we move into a few more things,

636
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I want to mention really quickly that there's been a big update on XFCE.

637
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
A new task manager, which sounds actually pretty dope,

638
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
including one of the things that's really nice is as you click on Windows on your desktop,

639
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
it'll automatically highlight that process in the task manager.

640
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And it just looks really nice too.

641
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
That's nice.

642
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Yeah. They're porting task manager to GTK3 and dropping support for GTK2.

643
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
They say so far the GTK3 branch already works and has a feature parity with master.

644
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
They're also working on the new notify D feature for XFCE.

645
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Thunar 1.6.11, which is a maintenance release but does bring some important fixes.

646
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
So Thunar is getting a new feature too with regards to copy.

647
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
So I guess their point is, hey, XFCE, we're not dead yet.

648
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Look at this great stuff coming out.

649
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
They're going to work on some panel stuff soon.

650
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
So there you go, Wes.

651
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's your next desktop.

652
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I wanted to give them a quick mention.

653
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I feel like nobody cares.

654
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
But it's still a very good minimal desktop.

655
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Do I need to stop covering it?

656
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Nobody cares.

657
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Look at this. Nobody cares.

658
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Yeah.

659
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Nobody cares.

660
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I mean, their last update was like in 2015.

661
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I just checked their website earlier.

662
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I can't give up on it.

663
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It was like one of my first loves.

664
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Yeah. I used it for a long time as well.

665
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I can't give up on it.

666
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
But I'm not getting any reaction from the chat room, from the mumble room.

667
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I mean, is it like a good anti-soulless coverage for the show just to wait it out that way?

668
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
No, man.

669
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
See, use XFCE.

670
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
We're telling you to just use it.

671
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It's good. It's good.

672
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It's good.

673
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yeah, okay.

674
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Does LXDE do the same thing pretty much?

675
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It's a lightweight desktop?

676
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Oh, here we go.

677
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I always get this.

678
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Of course.

679
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I'm not even a believer.

680
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I think lightweight desktops are bogus to begin with.

681
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I think the entire thing is bogus.

682
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
How do you like that?

683
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It's a bogus idea.

684
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It's a concept people use to trick themselves into thinking they're hacking their Linux box to be more efficient.

685
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
It's crap.

686
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
But I compiled it from source, Chris.

687
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
It's junk.

688
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I agree with you because then I always hear like, oh, yeah, plasmas bloated.

689
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
This is bloated.

690
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Like, no, that's not how this works.

691
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
It's garbage.

692
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It's garbage.

693
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
That's all.

694
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
All right, Monkeycom, you want to jump in.

695
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Go ahead.

696
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I haven't used XFCE in so long.

697
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I mean, it was good back in the day, but I want something like KDE or Mate which I can add modern things to and it's just not XFCE.

698
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I tell you what.

699
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I tell you what.

700
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I understand that you guys out there that are using it, you got your reasons.

701
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I appreciate that.

702
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
But I'm looking at this and I'm saying our chat room is pretty much pronouncing it dead.

703
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Our mumble room is – I just – I don't want to believe it.

704
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
They are the definitive source.

705
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I refuse.

706
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I refuse to accept it.

707
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I will continue to fight for XFCE for you out there, listener, because I want to be your representation.

708
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I will fight for you.

709
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I will fight for you.

710
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:36,000
A couple of years ago, we had this conversation and I really felt like XFCE was on the way out.

711
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:45,000
But seeing the amount of effort Simon's putting into projects recently, I think that he's turning the tide and it's got a bright future ahead of it.

712
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Thank you.

713
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
See Wimpy and me, we'll be here.

714
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
We will – thank you.

715
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Thank you.

716
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I agree.

717
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
It was a good blog post.

718
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And that does add a different spin on it, right?

719
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Like when you don't see updates, when you don't hear about it, that just makes it feel stagnant to you and that kind of goes a long way.

720
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Plus you know what the best thing would be?

721
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:09,000
The best thing would be that all of a sudden XFCE starts getting updated all the time and then all of these jerks that say they use XFCE because it never gets updated can STF you.

722
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So I think I am all for it.

723
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I want to talk about something that I've seen discussed in our subreddit a few times.

724
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And Wimpy, feel free to jump in any time you know something else or have something else to add.

725
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I find this to be a fascinating write-up over on – Wimpy, maybe you could tell me the gentleman's name that's been working on packaging up Snap for all the –

726
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Zygmunt.

727
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Oh, okay.

728
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Zygmunt.

729
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Zygmunt, yeah.

730
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
This is the state of SnapD support across distros.

731
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And he says, first of all, let me preface that SnapD development moves fast. There's a lot of things landing all the time. Many of them are non-trivial, introducing big changes.

732
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
A few of those include me in the loop, which significantly cuts out the amount of time I have left to work on.

733
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Ultimately, the whole problem is the problem of having inefficient time to work on everything.

734
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

735
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:07,000
So he says – he wants to go back. He says, during the SnapD sprint, I started working on distribution packages for Fedora, OpenSUSE, Arch, Gentoo and others.

736
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
After a few quick experiments, I was positive that it was doable and probably not that hard.

737
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Boy, was I wrong.

738
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Packaging SnapD is both straightforward and hard.

739
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
As a Go project, SnapD builds to a small set of executables and a few supporting system to units.

740
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
SnapD has a small brother, SnapConfine, that is written in C and builds anywhere with auto tools.

741
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So far, so good, right? Well, no.

742
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Fedora 25 requires any service started by SystemD to be confined by SELinux.

743
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Since SnapD itself is not confined, even on Ubuntu, this means that we would build a nice package, but you'd have to disable SELinux, which is not the experience they want their users to have, so the package was never officially released.

744
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Now, of course, there is some talk about creating an SELinux policy for it.

745
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Each Linux distribution has its own set of quirks and nuances.

746
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Software skew aside, the policy is what really differs Debian from Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE or Gentoo.

747
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
In one distribution, doing something is frowned upon, while in another, it's perfectly fine or even encouraged.

748
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:19,000
In fact, he does kind of give us an example about that down here, especially about like where the Snap packages would live.

749
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,000
First, he wanted to create SlashSnap, but the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee said, no, you can't use SlashSnap.

750
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So then after that, he said, okay, that's fine, that's their choice, so I'll move it to var lib SnapD SlashSnap.

751
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But of course, other distributions don't really care.

752
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Then there's the whole executable bit.

753
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
SnapD relies on a small c executable snap confined that is setuid root.

754
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It needs to be root to perform file system namespace manipulation necessary for the construction of the snap execution environment.

755
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Now, that's all fine and good except for Fedora highly and strongly discourages setuid root executables.

756
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
They'll allow it but is not recommended and they'll give you a course talking to.

757
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So Debian, though, however, exact opposite.

758
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
So Fedora wants you to use extended attributes and these kinds of things.

759
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,000
But Debian, no extended attributes for you.

760
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It must be a setuid.

761
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
OpenSUSE, to the best of his knowledge, requires that you first get a security review and then get your package

762
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
and the exact file name added to a special package called permissions.

763
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,000
For OpenSUSE, the plus S bit can apparently be used or this plus setuid bit sidestepping the permission package,

764
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
but it relies on a documented hack that just fools the packaging review tools.

765
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
He goes on to basically summarize, snap D is easily to build from source and run in almost any environment

766
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
with system D and a reason of kernel.

767
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You really should be able to get that going in just a few minutes.

768
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:56,000
However, packaging that for wider use is a rat's hole of issues and it's not done.

769
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Snappy is a free software project.

770
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
If you'd like to help him out, please reach out to him.

771
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
He's got links in this.

772
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
There's also the Snappy RC channel and on Rocket Chat.

773
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
He says, one day I'll write a book about packaging software for Linux distributions.

774
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'll start the book with the phrase, this book is already out of date.

775
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
That's a very good summary.

776
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:22,000
It's interesting how, I mean, Snappy is almost in a second package manager in a sense.

777
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
And so it's, I can see where it kind of breaks some of the abstractions or the, you know, be a lot easier like,

778
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
hey, I just want this game that runs, doesn't need any special permissions.

779
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Can I put it in your repository?

780
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Compile's done.

781
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
But when you suddenly need special permissions, when you're managing other apps,

782
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
when you're building your own project, it gets more complicated.

783
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Wimby, do you, you kind of fly close to the sun on this one.

784
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Do you have any things to share from this perspective?

785
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Yeah, I read Zygmunt's post last night and there's a couple of things that stand out.

786
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:56,000
The most interesting to me is when, you know, Linux vendors have been trying to bring,

787
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
you know, external people from outside of the Linux world to bring their software to Linux.

788
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:07,000
If you have to start explaining this stuff to them, that's why their software isn't on Linux.

789
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I agree.

790
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yep.

791
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And it is ironic that Snap, which is designed to solve these problems,

792
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
is facing these very same problems in order to solve those problems.

793
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Is the real problem just a lack of strong distro buy-off?

794
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Like if there was passion in the Fedora community, would there maybe?

795
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I think somewhere in Zygmunt's post that he said, you know,

796
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:39,000
the best thing you can have when you're working on this stuff is to actually have somebody

797
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
who's got commit rights to the packaging system for the distro who's interested to help you.

798
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
You know, if you've got that kind of collaboration, then it makes it easier because they know

799
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
what some of these nuances are with, you know, the distro that they work on

800
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
and what some of the requirements are that maybe somebody coming to it from the outside might not appreciate.

801
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
And I think that's true.

802
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
You know, my experience of working in Arch Linux and Debian and Ubuntu is that knowing somebody

803
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
that can help you is the best way to get stuff done to orientate yourself.

804
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I agree.

805
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:19,000
And I wonder if that doesn't mean that Flatpak might have some home turf advantage in that regard.

806
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Well, who can say?

807
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Maybe.

808
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I mean, obviously that's being sort of led by Fedora.

809
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I think it's a Fedora developer primarily that's working on that.

810
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So, yes, they're going to target their things.

811
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:41,000
But, you know, the different distributions have chosen different security models and, you know, different policies.

812
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
They all grew up at slightly different times and they would have done things in accordance to, you know,

813
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
how things were, you know, at that time to some extent and those policies would have shifted over time.

814
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So there are subtle differences, but those subtleties are challenging when you're working at such a low level.

815
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
You know where it leaves me wimpy is it leaves me still basically just relying on the AUR.

816
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I've seriously been considering switching to Neon LTS even or potentially we'll see another distribution that I feel like I don't want to list them all again.

817
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:27,000
But I'm considering in both cases an LTS distribution based on Ubuntu and I just – I think I find myself twice to three times a week

818
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,000
when prepping for the shows or something extremely grateful that I'm able to pull down an application from the AUR and try it really quick.

819
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And I don't know – that's what I would like from a universal packaging standard is that essentially all of the world's best open source

820
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
is available to me in a standard installable method.

821
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And I don't feel like we're any closer at all anymore.

822
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,000
We've been watching this now for a while and I feel like both sides have made really good gains but –

823
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Yeah, there has been progress.

824
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
We have some new frameworks and things that –

825
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Need killer applications, that's what we need.

826
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
We need killer apps.

827
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,000
We need killer apps.

828
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
We need really killer – we need like a bunch of them.

829
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
We need a bunch of really good ones.

830
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
I agree.

831
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:16,000
So looking at Flatpak applications, LibreOffice, Spotify, Monodevelop, Telegram, Skype, Blender, Gnome, Twitch, Gnome MPV.

832
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I mean there's some good ones on here, Corebird.

833
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
It's kind of the standard list right now.

834
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
And I should play around with the Telegram and Skype ones and see how frequently they're updated.

835
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Yes, those ones stand out to me as –

836
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
And Spotify.

837
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
At least especially on the Snap side it seems like the most – like if I can install –

838
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Yeah.

839
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Gnome MPV from like a copper or an easy enough other repo.

840
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Yeah.

841
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I really appreciate when I load up a new Ubuntu rig, I really appreciate the Telegram Snap.

842
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Yes.

843
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
That is really nice.

844
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I got to play around more with the Flatpak.

845
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Yeah, go ahead.

846
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So I was going to say last week I think I basically went through all of the applications that I have installed and found –

847
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I did a gap analysis to see which ones were available as snaps.

848
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:06,000
And I've installed the snaps of all of the things where it's available and purged the apt equivalents off my system.

849
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
So how's that going?

850
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Yes, it's going fine actually.

851
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I was expecting to run into lots of edge cases and things like that.

852
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:20,000
But I mean there's a couple of little niggles with app indicators that we're working on fixing.

853
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
But by and large it's working very well.

854
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Do all the mounted file systems ever bother you?

855
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
That's something I'm looking at actually.

856
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Yeah, that's something I'm going to look at, yeah.

857
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Huh.

858
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So I wonder how they got a Flatpak of Skype.

859
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I wonder how they got that.

860
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
They pulled down the deb and wrap it and –

861
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
It's just the Skype alpha.

862
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So somebody is volunteering to manually re-Flatpak that up.

863
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I don't think Microsoft Flatpak –

864
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
It's Alex Larson, the Flatpak developer, is doing that.

865
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Ah, that's a good way to get people using it I suppose.

866
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I'm going to mess around with all of it.

867
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,000
But this whole universal packaging thing, you know, I'm losing my momentum.

868
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Although I think it's still going to happen.

869
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Gosh, get universal already.

870
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Get universal already.

871
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
That's all I want.

872
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Just get it universal already.

873
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
All right, well we've got a lot more to talk about.

874
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,000
In fact, we should probably keep moving because Mr. Wessier is going to be text snapping soon.

875
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I want to mention Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

876
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Go there and sign up for a free seven-day trial and support the show

877
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
and get access to a platform to learn more about Linux, video courses, labs, instructor mentoring,

878
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
course schedulers, learning paths, practice exams and quizzes,

879
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
and note cards forked by the community which is stacked by Jupiter broadcasting members.

880
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:48,000
But this is big because Linux Academy is always growing, adding new content, making the old stuff even better.

881
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And they just announced a big partnership with Chef to provide high quality in-depth training.

882
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
You can find out more at linuxacademy.com slash cheftraining

883
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
and get started on the basic Chef fluency courses.

884
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Hallelujah.

885
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
You can get the basic Chef fluency badge.

886
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:09,000
They have public profiles and you also get all ready to take certifications too.

887
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
We got an email in the Linux Action Show the other day about courses to get into.

888
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
This would be a good one.

889
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Find out linuxacademy.com slash cheftraining.

890
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
But do me a favor.

891
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Start at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

892
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
That way we get the credit for your visit.

893
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
You can sign up for that free seven-day trial and check it all out.

894
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And Linux Academy is out on the street if you want to say hi.

895
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
They're at Developer Week, booth 229.

896
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Stop by, shake some hands and say hello.

897
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Look at that nice looking guy.

898
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I think I see some swag.

899
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I think I see swag there, Wes.

900
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
See that's maybe a woman.

901
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I know.

902
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And look at the size of that penguin.

903
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Look at the size of that sucker.

904
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Check them out.

905
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
That's at linuxacademy.com.

906
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Not.com, linuxacademy.com on Twitter if you want to follow their feed.

907
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Or go say hi at Developer Week.

908
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Like I said, it was booth 229.

909
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
And do me a favor and support the show.

910
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Visit linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

911
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

912
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
So this is a hell of a script.

913
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Takeover.sh, a script to completely take over a running Linux system remotely,

914
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
allowing you to log in in a memory rescue environment.

915
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I don't know why I thought that said recurse.

916
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Unmount the original root file system and do anything you want all without rebooting,

917
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
because Linux.

918
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You can replace it one distro with another without ever having to physically touch a console.

919
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Badass.

920
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Pretty sweet.

921
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Pretty badass.

922
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
That's really cool.

923
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And you see the warning, warning, warning, warning.

924
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
This is experimental.

925
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Yeah.

926
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Definitely try it out in a VM.

927
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You know, the first thing I think of is a VPS.

928
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yes, right?

929
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
You just spin it up, throw it away.

930
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It is neat.

931
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's not a bad read through if you just want to read over the script.

932
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
In the show notes, I linked a couple other ones that I find a little more readable,

933
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
but do the same thing that kind of walk you through to how to turn a Debian into an Arch.

934
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I bet it's fascinating just to learn how it's doing it.

935
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Yes.

936
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
And it kind of teaches you a little bit about like what happens in the initramfs.

937
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
How does this kind of work?

938
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So this one's interesting because he makes his own little fake init and kills init.

939
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
You can then kill, unmount the root file system,

940
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
kill all the old processes that you couldn't kill from your old session.

941
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Right.

942
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I've seen other versions and there's some here,

943
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
like one great stack exchange discussion about,

944
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
hey, can I like reformat or like resize my root partition from...

945
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
So you can also say make a little Ubuntu user land with systemd

946
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
and then put that in memory and pivot everything with your running kernel there.

947
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Wow.

948
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Yeah.

949
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That's some cool stuff.

950
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And then on the other end of the spectrum,

951
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:46,000
it turns out way back, way back in the day,

952
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Colin Percival created something called the Depenguinator.

953
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It's a script, and this is his words,

954
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:02,000
for remotely upgrading a Linux system to FreeBSD.

955
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
They never stopped those guys?

956
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
No, they just can't help themselves.

957
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It's great.

958
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It's so great.

959
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
It unfortunately didn't take long for changes in the layout of the FreeBSD releases

960
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
to make the Depenguination script stop working.

961
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:17,000
So for the past three years, he's been receiving emails, and he was motivated.

962
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
He wanted the Depenguinator to work with recent FreeBSD releases.

963
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
He got it all set up.

964
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
But with all things FreeBSD, they slipped behind,

965
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
and it only worked on Ubuntu 7.10 for FreeBSD 7.0.

966
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
That's pretty useful.

967
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Yeah, super useful.

968
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
You just downgrade from 16 to 7, then switch.

969
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
You're fine.

970
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
It's about as modern as that Linux compatibility layer.

971
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:45,000
So we all thought, okay, that was cute, but there's just not enough interest to keep this alive.

972
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And so Colin Percival sort of moved on, let it fade away.

973
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Had to go make tar snap.

974
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
You're a busy guy.

975
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Tar snap needed to be created, and there was really just not a big interest.

976
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Nobody saw it fit to spend their precious time creating Depenguinator 3.0

977
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
until Alan Jude came along.

978
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Alan Jude forks Depenguinator and creates version 3.0 to override a remote Linux server with FreeBSD.

979
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It's new. It's fresh. It's really simple.

980
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
So you swap off. You turn off your swap.

981
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
You DD the swap partition with MFSBSD.

982
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
You then go to your grub menu.

983
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
You fiddle with it to boot from the swap partition.

984
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
You reboot the system from inside MFSBSD.

985
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
You can then SSH into it and reformat everything to FreeBSD.

986
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Do I basically have the process?

987
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yes, you do.

988
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Damn it, Alan Jude.

989
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
And then he says, warning, still contains sharp edges, is not really meant for automated use.

990
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It's very likely that using this tool without understanding,

991
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
it will leave your server in an unbootable state.

992
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,000
That is pretty important if you're working with bare metal,

993
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
you don't have a nice HTML5 console, that kind of thing.

994
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Depenguinator.

995
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
So our challenge to you, audience, let's get the reverse.

996
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Let's say I got a FreeBSD droplet.

997
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I'm kind of sick of it. I want the latest Ubuntu.

998
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Right.

999
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Let's get that going.

1000
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
That would be good.

1001
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:18,000
There's not as much of a market need for that because there's not as many VPSs running FreeBSD,

1002
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
but we got to fix the ones that are.

1003
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
We have to upgrade them to Linux.

1004
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
You know what we should do?

1005
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Guys, guys, make it, switch it to Arch, right?

1006
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That's great.

1007
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Or Gentoo.

1008
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Whichever you prefer. Your choice.

1009
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
So let's make, they got Depenguinator, what should we call it?

1010
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Repenguinator?

1011
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
No, that's not as good.

1012
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Something with a GPL.

1013
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
That will be good.

1014
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Something with Richard Stallman, something with a GPL.

1015
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
My little room, you guys have any ideas?

1016
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Stallman strikes back.

1017
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
What would you call a script that converts a FreeBSD install,

1018
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
wipes it out, and switches it over to Linux?

1019
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So happy hacking.

1020
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
The de-demonizer?

1021
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
De-demonizer is not bad.

1022
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
It's not bad.

1023
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
The exorcism.

1024
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Beastie Be Gone.

1025
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
There we go.

1026
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I like that.

1027
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Beastie Be Gone or Exorcist.

1028
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Yeah, Beastie Be Gone.

1029
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I think it's got to be Beastie Be Gone.

1030
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Yeah, they're having a bad week.

1031
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Wasn't there also a new Beehive project announced

1032
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
that has nothing to do with Beehive Virtualizer?

1033
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Yeah, different spelling, but that's true.

1034
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Name collisions there.

1035
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And there's a snap for that as well.

1036
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Oh, God.

1037
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
It's probably going to have more users than Beehive.

1038
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I'm sorry.

1039
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Beehive is technically very cool, and the guys that work on it,

1040
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I respect them a lot.

1041
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I've talked to them, but that's funny,

1042
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
because that's going to be a thing.

1043
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So, yeah.

1044
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Yeah.

1045
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
De-demonizer or something with exorcism would be good.

1046
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And I say Archer Gentoo would be preferred.

1047
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
If you can make it, we'll run it next week.

1048
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
You know, you could even put Debian Stable.

1049
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
It'd still be more up-to-date and modern than FreeBSD.

1050
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Oh!

1051
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I'm just trolling at this point.

1052
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Just trolling.

1053
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
So, you heard us mention at DigitalOcean.com,

1054
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
go over there and create a droplet.

1055
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
This is a great way to get set up with their awesome,

1056
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
powerful infrastructure.

1057
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1058
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
It's one word.

1059
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
You apply it to your account, you get a $10 credit.

1060
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
DigitalOcean is incredibly fast, incredibly easy to use,

1061
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
and there's incredible prices.

1062
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Woo!

1063
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Woo!

1064
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Just kind of lost it for a second because I'm so excited.

1065
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I'm so excited.

1066
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
You know why I'm super excited?

1067
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
You have a problem.

1068
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
What's that?

1069
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
You have too much excitement.

1070
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
What are you going to do with it?

1071
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
How are you going to handle that?

1072
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I'm going to load balance it, Wes.

1073
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I'm going to load balance it.

1074
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Brand new DigitalOcean feature launched today.

1075
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Scale your applications and improve availability

1076
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
across your infrastructure in just a few clicks.

1077
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Don't look at it.

1078
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Go use it now.

1079
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Don't walk.

1080
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Run to DigitalOcean and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1081
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
It's simple to set up.

1082
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
You can easily manage the load balancers

1083
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
through DigitalOcean's API or control panel.

1084
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I got good ones at that.

1085
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
You can scale your traffic capacity.

1086
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I was just talking to the beard earlier today.

1087
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
We've been having some Libsyn problems.

1088
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
See, the thing about Libsyn is we've been a customer now

1089
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
for like as long as Libsyn has been a company,

1090
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and they have just gone through some bad changes,

1091
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
and they shut down one of our accounts

1092
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
because they don't offer that plan anymore.

1093
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Oh, no.

1094
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,000
You know what my first thought was?

1095
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Let's go spin up three droplets.

1096
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
They have data centers all over the world,

1097
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
so we'll do them in West Coast, East Coast, and in Germany.

1098
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Use the load balancer.

1099
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Easy-peasy.

1100
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
There's our new MP3 distribution system.

1101
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Set it up in just minutes.

1102
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
DigitalOcean.com.

1103
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
There's lots of reasons to try it,

1104
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
from simple infrastructure

1105
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
to long-term deployment and projects.

1106
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
We run lots of our backend pieces now on DigitalOcean.

1107
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
My backend is all up in DigitalOcean.

1108
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Yours can be, too.

1109
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED to get started.

1110
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Get a $10 credit and try them out.

1111
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Support the show, too.

1112
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
DOUNPLUGGED.

1113
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Thanks, DigitalOcean, for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1114
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
All right, Wes, you crazy SOB.

1115
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
You had a weekend with WireGuard.

1116
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Actually, I don't know how long you had time with WireGuard,

1117
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
but I know that you got a little WireGuard time in.

1118
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Now, break it down for me.

1119
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Break it down because I know we've talked about it before,

1120
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
but it sounds like you really kind of got inspired

1121
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
after watching this FOSDEM discussion on it,

1122
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
or listening to it, I guess.

1123
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Yeah, there's a MP4 and WebM, I think, if that's your style.

1124
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
So, yeah, Jason, the author, gave a talk at FOSDEM.

1125
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
It's a good talk.

1126
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
He talks fast, goes through a lot, but it's not that complicated.

1127
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And he has a really short demo,

1128
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
which is also linked on that same page that you can watch

1129
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
where he just kind of shows it off in the terminal.

1130
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And it's so easy to get started.

1131
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
That's kind of what appealed to me.

1132
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
So, on the site they kind of go through,

1133
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
and in the presentation they go through, it's a new VPN.

1134
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
It's opinionated, so it's layer 3 only, right?

1135
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
So you're not doing your broadcast domains, Ethernet stuff.

1136
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Uses the noise protocol framework.

1137
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Uses the noise protocol.

1138
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
So it makes some choices.

1139
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
It doesn't have cipher agility,

1140
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
so they have a set list of secure ciphers that are secure right now.

1141
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
So you don't even have the option to use a secure one.

1142
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And it's very minimal.

1143
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Like, here's the size of the open VPN code base.

1144
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Here's the size of strong SWAN.

1145
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Sure, because he's probably heavily relying on the kernel module

1146
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
to do the heavy lifting, right?

1147
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Or is he including that?

1148
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Uses a fair bit, and then his new stuff to be added

1149
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
is a little over 3,000 lines of C.

1150
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
So it hasn't been audited yet.

1151
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
We don't know. It's not even upstreamed yet.

1152
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
He's working on a 1.0 version,

1153
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
kind of finalizing some of the protocols and formats.

1154
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And then he's going to submit it for inclusion to the kernel.

1155
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
But it's really simple, and it works.

1156
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
It uses the interface as its native,

1157
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
kind of its base building block.

1158
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,000
So you do IP link add WG0 type WireGuard.

1159
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Now you have a new interface.

1160
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Then you assign it an IP address.

1161
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Right now, there is a third party,

1162
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
or he wrote a WireGuard utility

1163
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
that basically configures it with the keys that it needs

1164
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
and the peers it can allow.

1165
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
You do that, and IP link set WG0 up

1166
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
on your two hosts or whatever.

1167
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,000
So I'm VPNed right now to a droplet.

1168
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Oh, really?

1169
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
So one of the nice advantages it has is the way it works.

1170
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
It's kind of like the MOSH utility.

1171
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Oh, really?

1172
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
So you set the endpoint IP for your droplet.

1173
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Yeah.

1174
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I have my whole...

1175
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Actually, right now I'm connected to the IRC.

1176
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I'm connected to everything through the WireGuard tunnel

1177
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
on my laptop.

1178
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
It was working at home.

1179
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I suspended, turned it back on.

1180
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
It just works.

1181
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
So you have it right on the droplet,

1182
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
and that IP stays the same.

1183
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
And your laptop IP changes,

1184
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
and when you wake from sleep on a new Wi-Fi network...

1185
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Yeah.

1186
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And so he goes into it more in the presentation,

1187
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
but it has a very short handshake

1188
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
so it can start up again, and it's very quiet.

1189
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
By default, it doesn't do a lot of keep-alives or anything.

1190
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It does have some options for better NAT punching

1191
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
and that sort of thing.

1192
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
So there are a lot of caveats.

1193
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It's not open VPN.

1194
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
It doesn't come with a whole bunch of stuff.

1195
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
It's really meant to be a secure...

1196
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Just a secure, minimal base framework

1197
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
that you can build on top of.

1198
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
WireGuard securely encapsulates IP packets over UDP.

1199
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Can you tell this is like the third show I've done

1200
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
that my tongue is giving up?

1201
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
It's done.

1202
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
You add a WireGuard interface,

1203
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
configure it with your private key and your peers' public keys,

1204
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
and then you send packets across it.

1205
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
All issues of the key distribution

1206
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
and pushed configurations are out of scope of WireGuard.

1207
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
That's what I mean.

1208
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
These are issues much better left for other layers,

1209
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
which really you can solve those problems

1210
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
in ways that work better for you.

1211
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So for somebody like yourself,

1212
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
that might actually be kind of a preferred thing.

1213
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Yep.

1214
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I'm already thinking of using it.

1215
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I like Tink.

1216
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I use Tink, right?

1217
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So this does not necessarily replace Tink.

1218
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
You could do a lot of the same things.

1219
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Where would you use it in place of?

1220
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
It's not as good for a complete...

1221
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It wouldn't work in as a complete mesh necessarily

1222
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
or as a little less.

1223
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Sure, sure.

1224
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
But you could do like an IPsec style star configuration

1225
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
or other still similar to mesh,

1226
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
especially in an environment where it's less dynamic

1227
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
or where you have like configuration management

1228
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
or other systems where basically all the peers

1229
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
need to talk to you,

1230
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
they need to know about the peers

1231
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
and have the public keys

1232
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
or the peers they want to talk to you.

1233
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,000
But I do something where I have some family and friends

1234
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
who have VPN tunnels to my network.

1235
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I'm already thinking about placing Tink with this.

1236
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Really?

1237
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Because it just stays in place.

1238
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
And eventually I'm hoping it'll be in the kernel,

1239
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
so it'll be really easy as a dependency as well.

1240
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Yeah, he's upstreamed everything.

1241
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Well, it's not in the kernel yet,

1242
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
but it's planning to be.

1243
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Oh.

1244
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
So he started our discussion

1245
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
with the network maintainers already.

1246
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
He gave this talk.

1247
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
He has a white paper.

1248
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
And so at some point in this year,

1249
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
we expect to see it submitted for a formal review on the mailing list.

1250
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
So it could be a little while.

1251
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Yeah.

1252
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
But it's super easy.

1253
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
It's already packaged.

1254
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
So there's a copper repo.

1255
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
There's a PPA.

1256
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
In Arch, it's already there.

1257
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
And you can just install it as a DKMS module.

1258
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
It builds really easy.

1259
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
It takes like two minutes.

1260
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Yeah.

1261
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And then you don't have to worry about it.

1262
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Yeah.

1263
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
So once you have it all set up,

1264
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
your connection process is you just activate the interface

1265
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:38,000
once everything's configured.

1266
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Yep.

1267
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
You just turn on the interface.

1268
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
There's also a couple scripts that he wrote.

1269
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
So there's, again, it's meant as a lower level building block,

1270
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
but it comes with a WG Quick script

1271
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
where it has a little kind of like a system D style

1272
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
INI configuration file.

1273
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
And then there you can set up a little more

1274
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
so the script will also set your IPs and stuff.

1275
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
So you can pretty much do WG Quick up, WG Quick down.

1276
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And then that will up and down your interface.

1277
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
And that's a little script that takes care

1278
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
of all the other little nimbly's in the background.

1279
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Yeah.

1280
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
But I had already set that up before.

1281
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And so all I did when I got here,

1282
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
I'm pinging it right now, like 10 millisecond ping

1283
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
up to the San Fran droplet.

1284
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Really not bad.

1285
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
I just did IP link set interface up,

1286
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
and then it immediately does the handshake

1287
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
to get everything going again, and it just works.

1288
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
That's slick.

1289
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
WireGuard, WireGuard.io if you want to check it out.

1290
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Oh, I should mention there, IRC, thank you.

1291
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
They're already working.

1292
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
There's some PRs already for system D network D,

1293
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
which I think would be great.

1294
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
We need simple server configured VPNs and a network manager.

1295
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Yeah.

1296
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
And then you combine that with eventually getting the kernel.

1297
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Yeah.

1298
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Magic.

1299
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
It sounds pretty sweet.

1300
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
That'd be really nice.

1301
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Well, cool.

1302
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Very cool, Wes.

1303
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I'm glad you were able to try it out.

1304
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Because I remember us talking about it,

1305
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
and it seemed pretty exciting.

1306
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I'm a little bummed.

1307
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I was hoping the kernel module would be further along

1308
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:56,000
to being upstream because the reality is you can submit things all day long.

1309
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Yes, we don't know.

1310
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
There's no guarantees it will be approved,

1311
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
nothing like that at all.

1312
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Yeah.

1313
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
But that has been some positive reviews.

1314
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,000
That's how it works though, right?

1315
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,000
That's how it goes.

1316
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
The system D people seem to like it.

1317
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
So if that's a sign for or against, I really don't know.

1318
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
But it's something.

1319
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
All right.

1320
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I don't know what to make of that.

1321
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
That means it's probably going to be controversial.

1322
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Damn it.

1323
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Leonard, we love you though, really.

1324
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
We love you, baby.

1325
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Happy Valentine's Day.

1326
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
All right.

1327
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
That brings us to the end of this week's broadcast.

1328
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
184 has got to get out of here so we can make room for 185

1329
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
and the TechSnap show.

1330
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Now, I encourage you to visit our live stream at jblive.tv.

1331
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
But Chris, but Chris, when do I go?

1332
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Such a great question.

1333
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Such.

1334
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1335
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Feedback at linuxaction.reddit.com.

1336
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact.

1337
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Follow Wes on the Twitter.

1338
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
You're at Wes Payne, right?

1339
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
That's right.

1340
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I'm at Chris LAS.

1341
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Thank you for joining us.

1342
01:11:47,000 --> 01:12:14,000
See you right back here next Tuesday.

1343
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Thank you, Mumble Room.

1344
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I love your faces.

1345
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Thank you, Chat Room.

1346
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Let's go get our title, and then we got to scoot.

1347
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Wow, look at us though.

1348
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I think we're going to get well.

1349
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Oh, I see what happened.

1350
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,000
This clock over here says 326, and this clock over here says 329.

1351
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
We're not actually doing as well as I thought we were, but that's okay.

1352
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
For exception, that's kind of funny.

1353
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
XFC evangelism.

1354
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,000
That's pretty good, Wes.

1355
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Internet Walmart.

1356
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Yeah, that would be our first story.

1357
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Amazon chimes in.

1358
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Nice.

1359
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Nice.

1360
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And Al and the Penguin Slayer.

1361
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
How about that de-Penguify?

1362
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I know, right?

1363
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
It's a funny story.

1364
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I do think there's some things in that script we talked about.

1365
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Oh, Mumble's muted.

1366
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Sorry, Mumble.

1367
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I had you muted.

1368
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I love you anyways.

1369
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Go ahead if you were talking.

1370
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Sorry, guys.

1371
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I had you muted during the music, and I forgot to unmute you.

1372
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
I'm kind of sad Woolly wasn't able to stick around for WireGuard.

1373
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I know.

1374
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I know.

1375
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I know.

1376
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I know.

1377
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
So Wimpy, will we see you?

1378
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Probably not next week.

1379
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Probably nay on the Wimpy.

1380
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Don't know at this point.

1381
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Yeah, it was nice to have you.

1382
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
It was nice to have you.

1383
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
It was nice to have you.

1384
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Yeah.

1385
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Yeah.

1386
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
And thank you for bringing that story up, because that was an interesting discussion,

1387
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
too.

1388
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Yeah.

1389
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Yeah, I was a bit surprised by it, so I wondered how many people it had passed by.

1390
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It's funny that I saw it, and for some reason it didn't land with me.

1391
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
That's not an entire new desktop environment.

1392
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It didn't land for some reason.

1393
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I was just like, okay, well, I got to move on, but something about that's odd, and that

1394
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
was pretty much all I thought.

1395
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Chilling with Kylan.

1396
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Chilling.

1397
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Yes, I was about to suggest that, and then I saw WW had already put it there and started

1398
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
up.

1399
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
That's pretty good.

1400
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Will people know what the hell we're talking about?

1401
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Okay, I say it's chilling with Chilling versus Forkception right now.

1402
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
What do you like better, Wes?

1403
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Ooh.

1404
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
You like chilling with Chilling better?

1405
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I really do like it.

1406
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
There's a little bit less of that front end.

1407
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Once someone's seen the title and listened to the episode, they'll like it, right?

1408
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
It's a good title.

1409
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Yes.

1410
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
But it has a little less of the draw angle.

1411
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I see that.

1412
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Yeah.

1413
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Forkception is...

1414
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Yeah.

1415
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
But then again, maybe that's not what we should be letting drive our title choices.

1416
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Right.

1417
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
What's the main goal of the title?

1418
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I mean, I used to think it was to get people to watch and listen, but now I'm thinking

1419
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
it's to just please the people already listening, because with a podcast, it's a long show.

1420
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
It's not like you're just getting a lot of drive-bys.

1421
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
You've got to slowly just accrue your listener base.

1422
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
You've got to convince them to listen every time, or at least most of the time.

1423
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Talking about slowly accruing your listener base, can I make a small plug?

1424
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Yes.

1425
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
In fact, do while we're still recording, because I...

1426
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Go ahead.

1427
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Yes.

1428
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
So those of you that listen to the Ubuntu podcast will know that we're on a season break

1429
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
at the moment, and we always have a planning meeting after a few months to see if we're

1430
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
going to come back for another season, and we did that last week, and we're going to

1431
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
come back for season 10, and we'll be putting out a teaser episode soon.

1432
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:23,000
So if you want to hear more opinion from myself or Alan or Mark, then head over to UbuntuPodcast.org

1433
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:36,000
and get subscribed.
