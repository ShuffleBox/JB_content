00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
Hey, before we start the show, I think we should give everybody a deepfake update, right?

00:04.200 --> 00:07.000
Because everybody's probably been wondering about deepfakes.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.600
I have a YouTube channel that I'm not going to, I'm just going to link it.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.400
I'm not going to play anything.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.500
I'm just going to link it in the show notes.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.200
It is getting there, guys.

00:15.200 --> 00:15.900
It's getting there.

00:15.900 --> 00:23.400
The stuff that really convinced me is they take the Dark Knight Joker and they like put him in other movies.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.300
Did you see these videos?

00:24.300 --> 00:25.400
Yeah.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.700
Well, I haven't watched that particular one, but I have watched a couple of them.

00:28.700 --> 00:29.700
The Terminator ones.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.200
Yeah, yeah.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.500
Super creepy.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.000
Wes, did you find this?

00:34.000 --> 00:39.400
You know, I don't know where that popped up, but I've seen a lot of coverage and you can tell people are getting a little scared.

00:39.400 --> 00:44.300
We already do a terrible job of knowing, you know, what's real information and what's not.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.900
So when you can have perfect looking videos, I don't think it's going to get any better.

00:47.900 --> 00:49.100
It's gotten there.

00:49.100 --> 00:49.900
It's there now.

00:49.900 --> 00:50.900
Like Hollywood's done.

00:50.900 --> 00:54.500
I don't know that it's perfect, but it's freaking close, dude.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.200
It's so good.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.600
For the average person, I think they would just accept it.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.800
I leave it to the audience.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.100
Go check the link out in the show notes and then tell me if you think it's there.

01:03.100 --> 01:08.100
I kind of, I think most people, unless you know to look for it, it's there.

01:08.100 --> 01:14.400
This is Linux Unplugged episode 304 for June 4th, 2019.

01:14.400 --> 01:25.500
Oh, hey there.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.700
Welcome in to your weekly Linux talk show, Linux Unplugged.

01:28.700 --> 01:29.700
My name is Chris.

01:29.700 --> 01:30.500
My name is Lance.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.400
Hello, Mr. Payne.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.900
It is a warm and packed episode.

01:34.900 --> 01:37.000
Just hot out of grandma's oven.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.700
This week, we went down to Texas Linux Fest and had our minds blown.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.600
Mr. Cheesy's here in studio with me.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.300
Hey, what's up, guy?

01:45.300 --> 01:46.300
Hey, Bacon. How's it going?

01:46.300 --> 01:47.300
Oh, I'm doing good.

01:47.300 --> 01:48.800
You finishing up your post over there?

01:48.800 --> 01:49.900
Oh, my post is finished.

01:49.900 --> 01:50.100
Yeah?

01:50.100 --> 01:50.900
It's rocking and rolling, yeah.

01:50.900 --> 01:54.200
Right on. The Texas Linux post, post, post is up.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.700
It's a post post.

01:55.700 --> 01:59.700
You should check it out because, oh, man, there's some pictures in there that will make you salivate.

01:59.700 --> 02:00.900
That's true. That's true.

02:00.900 --> 02:09.300
We're going to talk about that today, but also some community news as well as a big congratulations to someone in the community about a housekeeping, some picks.

02:09.300 --> 02:16.800
But before we can do any of that stuff, it is our duty to say a big holler to our virtual log time appropriate greetings.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.000
Mumble room. Hello, everyone. Hello. Hello. Hello.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.100
Hello. I like that.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.000
It was such an orderly room today.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.800
It was very, very orderly. I agree.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.200
Hello, Brent, Bruce, Byte, Lynn, and Tech Mav.

02:28.200 --> 02:33.800
Good to have you all in there as well as Rotten and Mini Mac up there in the staging helping get people in and see.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.200
And Sylvia up there and Sivia up there in the old.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.300
How would you say that one, Wes? Sivia? I'm going to say Sivia.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.400
Siva machina machina.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.700
Oh, look at you. You had to get all fancy with it.

02:44.700 --> 02:45.800
Making me look bad now.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.700
That's what happens when you ask, okay? And you've learned the lesson.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.100
Okay. All right.

02:50.100 --> 02:50.900
You just got served.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.500
I did. And he's right, too. That's the worst part.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.000
You know, that's what happens when Wes works late in the studio.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.400
You know, he gets, he was there late last night and he was in earlier today fixing things up for us.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.000
So that's what happens. Very good on you, Wes.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.900
All right. Well, what do you say we get into some community news, guys?

03:08.900 --> 03:10.600
Stay a while and listen.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.200
There's quite a few things to talk about, but I don't know.

03:13.200 --> 03:17.500
This week, I didn't really want to talk about most of them, to be honest with you.

03:17.500 --> 03:26.100
I just, I don't know, the really good stuff we put in land this week and the other stuff sort of just didn't really register with me as much.

03:26.100 --> 03:27.200
Did you feel the same way?

03:27.200 --> 03:28.900
Yeah. It's kind of slow.

03:28.900 --> 03:34.000
Yeah. So I just kind of like, I think this week, I was more proud of what we didn't put in the show.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
There's some clickbait and stupid media hype stuff.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.300
And this week, it's just other cool stuff.

03:38.300 --> 03:42.700
So I wanted to start with speaking of cool stuff, the Smosh Z.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.800
I'm going to say it like that, the Smosh Z.

03:44.800 --> 03:49.900
It's supposed to make its formal debut at E3 next week as we record this.

03:49.900 --> 04:00.900
But it is a handheld in its current form that is fully AMD Ryzen powered with the V165B system on a chip with Vega graphics.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.600
And it's running Linux.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.100
Say what?

04:04.100 --> 04:08.500
Yeah, you can have it all to yourself starting around $629.

04:08.500 --> 04:12.900
That gets you four gigs of RAM and 64 gigs of onboard storage.

04:12.900 --> 04:16.100
There's a nicer model, too, all the way up around a grand.

04:16.100 --> 04:19.600
That's 16 gigs and 256 gigs of storage.

04:19.600 --> 04:20.700
Yeah. Yep. Yep.

04:20.700 --> 04:27.300
So it's supposed to get announced next week at E3, but Feronix and others don't expect it to begin shipping until later this year.

04:27.300 --> 04:36.500
But if you look at it, it's essentially got a phone LCD-like screen in the middle with a split up Steam controller on the sides.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.100
That's exactly what I was thinking when I saw the little Joy-Con.

04:39.100 --> 04:45.300
Yeah, it's got the touchpad thingies, just like the Steam controller has, and it's a full Ryzen stack.

04:45.300 --> 04:49.200
There's been rumors of this thing before, so this isn't the first time.

04:49.200 --> 04:57.300
In fact, they even teased it back in 2015 when AMD was looking for a partner, but they've got actual promo videos now.

04:57.300 --> 05:01.500
And they've got people they're sending to E3, and they've got press kits they're sending out.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.400
So we may have ourselves a handheld Linux device here.

05:04.400 --> 05:09.200
I noticed so far no mention of battery life. That makes me a little bit worried.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.400
Yeah. Could catch.

05:11.400 --> 05:16.300
Yeah, you know, and I'm hoping it's one of those ones where maybe you can just swap the battery out.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.400
That would be great to give us that sort of device.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.800
I'm going to go into sales mode here, because that's exactly what I was thinking.

05:20.800 --> 05:25.000
So Brent, you're my potential customer in this scenario, and here I'm going to try to sell to you.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.300
So Brent, what I have here is a nice portable Linux gaming device.

05:29.300 --> 05:34.900
It can play some popular games such as, and it also has a removable battery,

05:34.900 --> 05:40.300
and you can put a battery in there. It's easy to do such as, as well as expandable storage with an SD card.

05:40.300 --> 05:42.200
It'll support up to X.

05:42.200 --> 05:46.100
And, well, Brent, we just think this would be a great gaming device for somebody like yourself who's on the go.

05:46.100 --> 05:49.000
You don't have a lot of extra room in your bag. You just slip this right into your bag.

05:49.000 --> 05:53.300
You could put a couple extra batteries in there, and this thing will be a playable device for an entire flight.

05:53.300 --> 05:54.500
Did I sell you?

05:54.500 --> 05:56.100
Where do I get one?

05:56.100 --> 05:56.500
Really?

05:56.500 --> 05:59.000
I think the battery.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.200
Yeah, totally. The battery switching out, like if you're a heavy gamer, especially if you're flying, of course,

06:04.200 --> 06:06.000
why would you not want to change the battery?

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
So what I would want to know is how quickly can I change the battery?

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
It would be a big standout feature because it's baked into the Switch, which I think is the biggest competitor.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.600
It's, if this is, well, it's not really a competitor to the Switch, obviously, but that's what it's trying to compete with, I should say.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.200
Yeah, I mean, I think that's where it's trying to compete.

06:23.200 --> 06:26.600
Obviously, it's going to be a smaller display.

06:26.600 --> 06:31.200
It is going to have that Ryzen 1605B system on a chip.

06:31.200 --> 06:31.900
What do you think of that?

06:31.900 --> 06:33.200
Four gigs of RAM.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.100
What do you think of the Ryzen chipset?

06:34.100 --> 06:38.600
I think that's the right avenue for them to go for something like this, absolutely.

06:38.600 --> 06:45.600
I mean, it runs Steam OS, so technically any Steam game that will run on Linux will operate with it.

06:45.600 --> 06:53.200
I mean, there's enough juice there to play a game of Counter-Strike at 1080, 60 frames a second.

06:53.200 --> 06:58.200
So, I mean, you definitely have a lot of power in your hand with a little device like that.

06:58.200 --> 07:04.000
And if they were to say, hey, you know, maybe this supports your Dreamcast emulation.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.800
Well, don't forget about Steam Play.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.300
Or Steam Play streaming.

07:07.300 --> 07:10.200
Steam Play streaming or, you know, these additional services.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.800
So I think this is a good market.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.800
I think the prices might be a little bit steep.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.800
I'd like to see it more around the $400 to $500 range for the base.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.700
Because what is the Switch now?

07:20.700 --> 07:21.400
Around there.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.400
You know, so you got to kind of be in that same, if you're going to sell a similar device,

07:25.400 --> 07:30.400
but with a smaller display, but with additional features, you still kind of need to be in that price range.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.400
So we'll see where it goes.

07:31.400 --> 07:37.400
So I'd be interested to get one if, you know, it turned out that the reviews were great.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.400
Bight, have you been following this device?

07:39.400 --> 07:41.400
Yeah, since the beginning.

07:41.400 --> 07:48.400
And there was even some rumor that it even was a scam because they were using a tablet

07:48.400 --> 07:53.400
and deconstructed Steam controller.

07:53.400 --> 08:00.400
At that time, I purchased the GPD Win and that one was a blast for that time.

08:00.400 --> 08:07.400
But yeah, this machine, it finally came out or coming out like how it's supposed to be.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.400
Yeah, it may be.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.400
It's not out yet.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.400
It may be still the rest of the year before we see it.

08:12.400 --> 08:16.400
And by then, will we be as impressed by the Ryzen chipset?

08:16.400 --> 08:20.400
I suppose it depends on what games they really push for it, what they try to sell it as.

08:20.400 --> 08:25.400
Well, I mean, with the large one at 16 gigs of RAM and 250 gigs of storage,

08:25.400 --> 08:29.400
16 gigs of RAM on a device like that?

08:29.400 --> 08:36.400
Yeah, I mean, whatever display they throw in it, you're going to get a 60-frame frame rate out of something like that.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.400
That's a pretty reasonable price difference too, right?

08:39.400 --> 08:43.400
Like where else do you get like four times as much RAM for a couple hundred extra dollars?

08:43.400 --> 08:45.400
That certainly doesn't happen in the Mac ecosystem.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.400
Absolutely not.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.400
I don't know, though.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.400
What do you think, Wes, about the heat something like that's going to produce?

08:50.400 --> 08:51.400
It's got to get hot.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.400
Yeah, that's a good question.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.400
Hot.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.400
I'm worried about the battery life.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.400
And is it going to ship?

08:57.400 --> 09:02.400
There's might actually ship in this title year for the story linked in our show notes, of course.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.400
And that's just never a good omen.

09:04.400 --> 09:10.400
When you have to be hopeful as the journalist reporting on it, it doesn't leave me in a very hopeful spot.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.400
One of the stories that got me grumpy this week,

09:13.400 --> 09:16.400
and I don't really feel like talking about it much because it's wait and see,

09:16.400 --> 09:19.400
but this stuff that Chrome is doing with the ad blocking,

09:19.400 --> 09:21.400
they're making changes to their manifest list.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.400
We've talked about it in LAN.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.400
And it's still up in the air.

09:24.400 --> 09:30.400
No final decisions have been made on this thing that right now is people very upset about,

09:30.400 --> 09:33.400
potentially really limiting the usefulness of ad blockers.

09:33.400 --> 09:37.400
And it kind of just got me in a funk because I really don't like where we're going

09:37.400 --> 09:40.400
with so much control in Google's hands for the web

09:40.400 --> 09:46.400
and how they are now just as – it's like if you could have made a worst-case scenario

09:46.400 --> 09:48.400
how they would leverage Chrome, they're doing it now.

09:48.400 --> 09:53.400
And you watch what they're doing with AMP, and I just don't like the direction it's going in.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.400
It's the portal to Google's world, man.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.400
I know, but it makes me suspicious of everything that they're doing.

09:58.400 --> 09:59.400
And I don't like that feeling.

09:59.400 --> 10:04.400
So the one way that I kind of push back is I'm like, well, all right, let's start looking at alternatives.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.400
And I remembered about our friends over at PeerTube.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.400
We haven't talked about them in a while.

10:07.400 --> 10:11.400
And this is kind of, you know, replacing YouTube for me would be a major accomplishment

10:11.400 --> 10:13.400
by the open source community.

10:13.400 --> 10:16.400
If we could get it replaced with something that was open source and it took off

10:16.400 --> 10:21.400
and people started having their own self-hosted YouTubes just – and it's not crazy.

10:21.400 --> 10:26.400
I mean, look at all these different industries that are now doing their own streaming services.

10:26.400 --> 10:30.400
I mean, maybe these same companies would want to have their own YouTubes

10:30.400 --> 10:33.400
and let's hope they could base it off something that's standard.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.400
I will say PeerTube is kind of a technological accomplishment.

10:36.400 --> 10:40.400
I don't use it all the time, but I've played with it and I've watched a significant number of videos

10:40.400 --> 10:43.400
on some of the various hosted instances out there.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.400
By and large, it just works.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.400
I'm really impressed with that.

10:47.400 --> 10:51.400
Yeah, we've had members of the community set one up for us in the past and moved it around a bit.

10:51.400 --> 11:00.400
And they've just released a brand new version, which adds – I'm very, very, very happy to say –

11:00.400 --> 11:07.400
playlist support, including watch laters, private playlists, public playlists.

11:07.400 --> 11:14.400
They've also added experimental HLS support, which has better bandwidth management for both the client and the server.

11:14.400 --> 11:18.400
Just a whole bunch of other stuff, including user management, optimizations, SEO improvements,

11:18.400 --> 11:25.400
adding a not-safe-for-work policy and filter, and being able to block and blacklist that stuff if you don't want it.

11:25.400 --> 11:34.400
Just a lot of really nice, easier-to-use, full-feature kind of flushing out stuff that it's just really nice to see landing in this project.

11:34.400 --> 11:40.400
Yeah, and they also add support for Japanese, Netherlands, and Portuguese.

11:40.400 --> 11:47.400
So if you're looking for adoption rate, I think that's something a lot of people don't focus on.

11:47.400 --> 11:53.400
If you want to make this something that everyone is going to jump on board with and use as a standard,

11:53.400 --> 11:55.400
you need all that documentation there for everyone.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.400
You got it, girl. You got it.

11:57.400 --> 12:03.400
Well, look at that. Coming now into the virtual log, Mr. Popey and Wimpy, gentlemen, great to see you. How are you both?

12:03.400 --> 12:04.400
Dudes.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.400
Good evening.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.400
Very well, thanks.

12:06.400 --> 12:11.400
Hello from Texas. Hello. We're still down here. We just did Texas Linux Fest down here.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.400
Mm-hmm.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.400
Going to go get ourselves some babes chicken tonight.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.400
Oh, yeah. The world's finest fried chicken.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.400
It's just not fair.

12:18.400 --> 12:23.400
I've been enjoying myself the Ubuntu podcast, as always. Been a very fine season so far.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.400
We just finished recording two more episodes.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.400
I suspected that might be the case.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.400
Nicely done, gentlemen.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.400
Nicely done. I look forward to hearing them.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.400
This week is a week of three episodes.

12:32.400 --> 12:33.400
Whoa.

12:33.400 --> 12:34.400
What?

12:34.400 --> 12:37.400
Yeah. So a very special live recording.

12:37.400 --> 12:42.400
Oh, right. Right. That's very – when is that? We should plug that.

12:42.400 --> 12:47.400
So that's this Saturday coming. It's Foss Talk Live.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.400
Joe will be there as well.

12:50.400 --> 12:54.400
And it's just a great mashup of different podcasters in the area that are going to be recording their shows.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.400
They'll do a mashup show. They'll do their own shows. It'll be great.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.400
And some drinking, I bet, will happen as well.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.400
Well, it's in a pub, so I think that's inevitable.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.400
No.

13:03.400 --> 13:06.400
It just helps to grease the shows.

13:06.400 --> 13:11.400
That's right. Yeah. By the last – whoever's on last, they're going to be struggling.

13:11.400 --> 13:19.400
It's a little bit dangerous this year, because in the past, the pub hasn't opened until like five o'clock in the evening, but I hear it's opening at midday this year.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.400
Oh, wow.

13:20.400 --> 13:25.400
So there's danger of, you know, yeah, we're going to have to control ourselves.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.400
Otherwise, Poby will walk out of there sounding like this.

13:27.400 --> 13:36.400
Again?

13:36.400 --> 13:41.400
Oh, that's so good. And tell me if you can guess who this is.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.400
That's Joe.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.400
That's Joe.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.400
That's so good.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.400
My sound board gets better and better every week. I love it.

13:47.400 --> 13:53.400
Drew's been editing the Ubuntu podcast now, and he's also been grabbing me those clips.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.400
It's a double-edged sword, I will say.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.400
It's good.

13:56.400 --> 14:00.400
He's a great editor, but he knows how to get the clips.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.400
It's good for me.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.400
Well, I want to say a big happy birthday.

14:03.400 --> 14:12.400
Ferronix turns 15 years old tomorrow as we record this.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.400
Awesome.

14:13.400 --> 14:23.400
Yeah, Michael Erbil has been churning away at that now for 15 years and 11 years since the Ferronix test suite launched, which is a hell of a benchmark suite.

14:23.400 --> 14:30.400
And to celebrate the 15th birthday, he's working on a whole bunch of different articles that he'll be pushing over the week and the month of June.

14:30.400 --> 14:37.400
And it's also not a bad time to go sign up if you want to support his work over there because he's got a sale going for the birthday.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.400
That's good for him.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.400
15 bucks for a year, dude.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.400
That's a pretty good deal. I signed up already.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.400
That's a solid deal.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.400
It is a solid deal.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.400
15 years, though, it just doesn't – 11 years for the test suite?

14:49.400 --> 14:50.400
I know.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.400
God, I'm so old.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.400
And he just hustles, right? Do you see the amount of stuff he publishes?

14:55.400 --> 14:56.400
Every day.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.400
Basically every single day.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.400
It's exhausting to think about it, to be honest.

14:59.400 --> 15:04.400
And it's so much more work than we can even understand because that's the thing about content creation.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.400
It's always way more work than you could know.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.400
And so I know that's true for him, too, even though I'm not a writer.

15:09.400 --> 15:16.400
This whole Texas Linux fest, I've got to be honest with you, has made me start to feel like maybe I'm becoming an old-timer.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.400
Absolutely.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.400
You too?

15:18.400 --> 15:19.400
Absolutely, yeah.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.400
Yeah, that's interesting.

15:20.400 --> 15:25.400
So we'll talk about that a little bit more as we get there because, yeah, that's been a thing.

15:25.400 --> 15:30.400
But before we get there, I was tweeted by at Jim Cops on Twitter.

15:30.400 --> 15:36.400
He said, I would be interested in Chris Lass and the group's take on this particular issue.

15:36.400 --> 15:43.400
For the record, this has been my opinion since the first year we ever heard the meme that it was the year of the Linux desktop.

15:43.400 --> 15:47.400
And this is the piece that he's having me read to you guys.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.400
It's an interview on ZDNet with Linus.

15:50.400 --> 15:59.400
And in this interview, Linus says, I still wish we were better at having a standardized desktop that goes across all distributions.

15:59.400 --> 16:07.400
It's a personal annoyance how the fragmentation of the different vendors have, I think, held the desktop back a bit.

16:07.400 --> 16:17.400
And then VMware's Chief Open Source Officer, Dirk Hondel, jumps in and says he agrees and that it is a frustrating situation for app developers.

16:17.400 --> 16:22.400
This week, there's also been discussion about the desktop is not a platform.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.400
Elementary OS is a platform.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.400
Gnome is a platform.

16:25.400 --> 16:29.400
Linux itself is not a platform.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.400
Let's start with our friends that are back from a bit.

16:32.400 --> 16:37.400
Wimpy, as somebody who has a very great desktop in Ubuntu MATE, what do you think?

16:37.400 --> 16:41.400
Is the distributions the problem when it comes to the desktop?

16:41.400 --> 16:47.400
Let's say for a moment, just for a moment, let me imagine every distribution shipped MATE.

16:47.400 --> 16:51.400
Would that truly be a better scenario for the developers, do you think?

16:51.400 --> 17:04.400
This is a difficult admission, but yes, obviously, if we had fewer Linux desktop environments and they were common across the major distros,

17:04.400 --> 17:09.400
then that makes Linux, in air quotes, an easier platform to target.

17:09.400 --> 17:19.400
And we kind of have that because Ubuntu does come on the lion's share of users on the Linux desktop.

17:19.400 --> 17:24.400
And I know that that might be unpopular to hear with some people, but it's simply a statement of fact.

17:24.400 --> 17:35.400
And this is why even to this day, you will find that application developers, even outside of the Linux bubble,

17:35.400 --> 17:39.400
make use of technologies that came from Unity 7.

17:39.400 --> 17:47.400
So app indicators and what have you are almost certainly supported by the application that you install from a third party vendor.

17:47.400 --> 17:54.400
So yes, it's true that if we all had a single platform to get behind, then this would cut through some of that.

17:54.400 --> 17:57.400
But then again, we have a dominant platform.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.400
And if everyone gets behind that, you get the same thing.

18:00.400 --> 18:05.400
So I want to take that part of your question and I want to bounce that to Pope here in a moment, but I want to follow up with you and say,

18:05.400 --> 18:21.400
so if that is true, then do you believe that the cost of having Ubuntu MATE and have it do its own thing is less expensive than the cost of one less group having all of their effort behind a common desktop?

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
Do you follow my question?

18:22.400 --> 18:23.400
Yeah, I do.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.400
And it's something I was reflecting on quite recently, actually.

18:26.400 --> 18:41.400
I was asking myself, am I actually helping or detracting from the greater good here by me having my own little project that services the needs of me and my friends and my family?

18:41.400 --> 18:46.400
Am I doing a disservice to the wider community because I'm being selfish?

18:46.400 --> 18:50.400
And the answer is, well, yes, I am doing a disservice.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.400
And yes, I am being a bit selfish.

18:52.400 --> 19:01.400
But then again, I'm doing the thing in my spare time that interests me, motivates me and I get enjoyment from.

19:01.400 --> 19:07.400
And my creative pursuit happens to be a desktop operating system.

19:07.400 --> 19:15.400
And for somebody else, it may be painting or sculpting or playing an instrument or singing in a choir or whatever.

19:15.400 --> 19:27.400
And I'm not in a position to tell those people how they should spend their free time in order to get enjoyment and creative endeavor from their efforts.

19:27.400 --> 19:32.400
So selfishly, I'm sorry, I don't care.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.400
I enjoy making the thing that I make.

19:35.400 --> 19:41.400
I make it for myself, my friends and my family, and I will continue to do so.

19:41.400 --> 19:46.400
And I realize that there is some damage there to the wider Linux ecosystem.

19:46.400 --> 19:55.400
But then again, I'm slightly privileged in that I can see the statistics that the Ubuntu report gathers.

19:55.400 --> 20:02.400
You know, every time you install Ubuntu, you can say, you know, send my hardware specs back.

20:02.400 --> 20:09.400
And Ubuntu Mate is actually very popular when you compare it to other major distributions.

20:09.400 --> 20:15.400
But when compared to Ubuntu proper, it's a fraction of a rounding error.

20:15.400 --> 20:20.400
But Ubuntu Mate is still way more popular than a load of other distributions.

20:20.400 --> 20:29.400
So I would say the answer is there for us is get behind the big player, which is Ubuntu.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.400
And that solves your fragmentation problem. Target Ubuntu.

20:32.400 --> 20:38.400
All right. So let's go from there. And I would also add just to your answer, more free software doesn't really hurt anybody.

20:38.400 --> 20:46.400
And but Popey, is that almost the only solution is in a world where everybody is scratching their own itch and freestyling?

20:46.400 --> 20:57.400
And it's an organic process of creating software where the strongest survive is the only way to really kind of dominate this market and set a standard just to be the huge, obvious winner?

20:57.400 --> 21:00.400
Because you can make a free desktop standard, but it doesn't mean anybody's going to follow it.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.400
Somebody just has to set the standard by being, don't they?

21:03.400 --> 21:10.400
It's OK for there to be lots of different distros and it's OK for people to learn how to build a distro.

21:10.400 --> 21:19.400
I do worry that people don't realize that the amount of effort that's required to create that.

21:19.400 --> 21:23.400
And then when they walk away, they leave people in limbo.

21:23.400 --> 21:31.400
I think that that is a very real problem is and those people then have to go and find distro to be something really great and really amazing.

21:31.400 --> 21:40.400
If you just walk away from it, it can really waste the time of, you know, maybe 10 other people or more.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.400
Yeah, yeah. Well put. Well put, I think.

21:43.400 --> 21:52.400
I'm wondering, though, like, how does this how does this idea affect innovation in the desktop world for Linux?

21:52.400 --> 21:59.400
So if we just stick to one base framework, whatever that is, one desktop, one style.

21:59.400 --> 22:11.400
How do we get to that minority report UI desktop that we all want to see or how do we, you know, we have to leave this open so that people can can take it and run with these tools and make this.

22:11.400 --> 22:19.400
But I do see, you know, building a distro, running it for a year and then dropping it and then leaving 500 people in limbo is definitely not the way to handle it.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.400
I think you touched on it, though.

22:20.400 --> 22:28.400
I think that that point you make about the minority report desktop is a subtle point, but really important.

22:28.400 --> 22:38.400
I don't know if you've watched the interview that Mark did with Swapnil recently where he talked a bit about the Ubuntu desktop and desktop Linux in general.

22:38.400 --> 22:54.400
But Mark made the point that the Linux desktop has failed to succeed because we have broadly followed what Windows has been doing and been trying to reach feature parity with Windows.

22:54.400 --> 23:11.400
And what we haven't been doing is being bold and trying to create something distinctive and compelling that brings people to Linux because it is different and compelling and a step change in functionality.

23:11.400 --> 23:26.400
But we made Unity and I know this is unpopular opinion, but Unity was more successful. I know people class Unity as a failure because we shut down the project, but it was more successful than any other desktop.

23:26.400 --> 23:31.400
There are still people, a million or more people using Unity every day.

23:31.400 --> 23:43.400
And that is incredibly successful. And the only reason it isn't more than a million or more is because we switched to GNOME. We drove everyone to switch to GNOME in Ubuntu.

23:43.400 --> 23:52.400
So I think we did do some innovation there. And before Unity came along, I don't think Dell sold a tremendous number of Linux laptops.

23:52.400 --> 24:06.400
And I realized that they had a certain bit of innovation inside Dell. But once they got a really usable, user-friendly desktop for users, they sold a truckload more of them.

24:06.400 --> 24:22.400
Here's my thoughts on it. Everybody that writes about it in the sense of it's failed or it's never going to work, I want to have a little beer and I want to have a little snack and I want to be sitting at a table and I just want to say, slow down, child. Just slow down.

24:22.400 --> 24:32.400
Give it some time. See, we're really bad at this because to us, we don't have a lot of time on this planet for one thing and a lot of things are happening. It's over. It's come, it's gone.

24:32.400 --> 24:41.400
This stuff's going to be around longer than us. And it'll just, over time, it will grow, it will change, it will adapt, it'll become what the people need.

24:41.400 --> 24:56.400
So right now, the way we get it is through scale. That's the state we get today. We get standards by scale. That's why Google is bending the way the web operates now because they have scale with Chrome.

24:56.400 --> 25:06.400
Canonical has scale with Ubuntu desktop. So that's why a lot of vendors have to support Ubuntu if they want to ship for the desktop. That's why Steam works so well on Ubuntu.

25:06.400 --> 25:19.400
They have the scale to set the standard. Red Hat has scale on the server. Canonical also has scale on the server. There's certain things that just the market adopts. That's the best we're going to get right now.

25:19.400 --> 25:33.400
And it works. So I guess there is a standard. It's just what the majority of people use. And then we sit here and we fight about it all. I guess we should probably move on.

25:33.400 --> 25:37.400
I'll give Minimac the last word on it before we go. Minimac, what do you want to chime in with?

25:37.400 --> 25:58.400
Yeah, it is interesting to see the development in Unity gave us global menu. And even though Ubuntu digged the global menu and the Unity desktop, you see that you have the Vala panel, for example, that gives the global menu possibility now for the X-phase desktop and I think also for Mate.

25:58.400 --> 26:02.400
So things live on. That's a cool thing, I think.

26:02.400 --> 26:22.400
Yeah. And in fact, that particular project, it was after Unity was discontinued in 2017. And I'd been working on the Ubuntu desktop team at that point, and I'd come to appreciate the finer points of Unity 7 that I hadn't seen before.

26:22.400 --> 26:39.400
That I then approached the Vala panel project and helped mold it into what it is today to reimplement a lot of those, you know, Ubuntu technologies so that they are broadly available today because they are pretty great.

26:39.400 --> 26:45.400
And lots of people want global menus and app indicators and the HUD and various other things.

26:45.400 --> 26:59.400
And just searching for apps and launching it from the search. Some of that stuff had been done in other places, but that desktop brought it all together. And I remember when it was announced that it was over, I went and took a vacation in Unity for a while and appreciated certain things about it.

26:59.400 --> 27:03.400
But we have pulled a lot of the best elements forward, I think.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.400
Alrighty, sir.

27:05.400 --> 27:17.400
Well, before we get into the Texas Linux Fest stuff, we do just have a few items in housekeeping, some really good stuff this week. Number one, probably the most important. Remember how many seconds I said it was? Was it 7?

27:17.400 --> 27:18.400
17?

27:18.400 --> 27:19.400
17? Is that what it is?

27:19.400 --> 27:23.400
Yeah, 17. It was 17 seconds. I'm positive it was 17 seconds.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.400
The best 17 seconds.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.400
Look it up.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.400
From Texas Linux Fest.

27:27.400 --> 27:28.400
It's gonna be 17.

27:28.400 --> 27:34.400
The best 17 seconds from Texas Linux Fest will be in the Friday stream.

27:34.400 --> 27:42.400
Hilarious moment happened. I happened to have my microphone going, and we happened to catch it.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.400
Let's see, were you right? Yes, you were right. It is 17 seconds. You were right.

27:45.400 --> 27:46.400
Told you it was right.

27:46.400 --> 27:55.400
It was also one of the most expensive clips that I've ever gotten. And also, I think I'm gonna owe Ellen an apology.

27:55.400 --> 27:59.400
But all that will be in the Friday stream, so check that out at fridaystream.com. Should be pretty good.

27:59.400 --> 28:05.400
Get a chance to hang out with those of us here on the show that, you know, turns out we're human beings. We got other things going on too.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.400
Yeah, the Laidback Show.

28:07.400 --> 28:15.400
It's gonna be live at 1pm this week. I'll be back in Seattle, 1pm Pacific, jblive.tv, and get it converted in your time.

28:15.400 --> 28:29.400
Also, got a whole bunch of Meetup stuff coming up very soon. This Friday, in San Antonio, an unofficial hacker family dinner. Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for details on that.

28:29.400 --> 28:33.400
Elle's gonna be at B-Sides!

28:33.400 --> 28:37.400
Elle, you got anything you wanna say about B-Sides? Maybe people can find you?

28:37.400 --> 28:44.400
Yeah, just look for the hair, as you always say. And it's gonna be myself and Ally, so no matter who you find, you're gonna find someone who knows me.

28:44.400 --> 28:53.400
There you go. Yeah, and the dinner details are at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting. Also coming up very soon is our next study group.

28:53.400 --> 29:02.400
Back to the basics. Linux permissions 101. Join Alex and Elle for an introduction to Linux permissions.

29:02.400 --> 29:09.400
Not Alex, ironic badger Alex, but Alex from Rackspace, as we go over the basics of Linux permissions and other things.

29:09.400 --> 29:14.400
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting. For that, it will be Tuesday, June 11th.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.400
That's where you just chmod 777 everything, right?

29:16.400 --> 29:20.400
Yeah, dash r, sure. Yeah, and put a sudo in front of that, so that way it works.

29:20.400 --> 29:25.400
What I would do is just open up your terminal, right, sudo dash s, hit enter, and just leave it up.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.400
Okay, I'll try that.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.400
Is this before or after I push putty in there?

29:30.400 --> 29:35.400
You know, I might have that wrong. I better attend that study group myself. Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

29:35.400 --> 29:48.400
And last but not least, Jeezy, did you know the Linux Academy is cranking away some new code for their video player in the apps for both Android and iOS, but as well as Fire TV?

29:48.400 --> 29:51.400
And Android TV support is coming, too.

29:51.400 --> 29:52.400
That's super awesome.

29:52.400 --> 29:54.400
I know. I know. And they're adding...

29:54.400 --> 29:55.400
And it looks great, too.

29:55.400 --> 30:00.400
They're going to add transcripts to the video player, so you can follow along with transcripts in the video player.

30:00.400 --> 30:09.400
Zoom and pan on the video, also to pull up related training videos that you can watch, and subtitles will be in there, too, with a whole new UI for the video playback, too.

30:09.400 --> 30:16.400
All that's coming soon to the new app, so I wanted to let you guys know if you don't have the Linux Academy app, you can use it now for free as a community member.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.400
If you're just signed up to the community edition, so that's really great. Check that out.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.400
We'll have a link in the show notes for that.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.400
We've got a lot going on.

30:23.400 --> 30:28.400
And that last study group we did, Don't Be Famous, learning is all about the Kubernetes.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.400
Securing your Kubernetes.

30:30.400 --> 30:34.400
Your Kubernetes, that's up on the YouTube, youtube.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.400
That's up and available for anybody now.

30:36.400 --> 30:41.400
And it's good, too, because honestly, that is a packed study group, so you're probably going to want to watch it a couple of times.

30:41.400 --> 30:42.400
I know I did.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.400
Yeah.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.400
No kidding, right?

30:44.400 --> 30:48.400
The Kubernetes is thick, but that was great.

30:48.400 --> 30:51.400
Hart really does a great job of just breaking it down.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.400
Yeah, absolutely.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.400
You know somebody really understands it when they can explain it simply, right?

30:55.400 --> 30:57.400
And don't forget, the notes are available on the GitHub.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.400
Boom.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.400
It's magic right there.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.400
That is some magic.

31:00.400 --> 31:07.400
Yeah, that's something Elle's doing that's really cool, is she's publishing the notes for the study groups, so that way you guys can follow those along as well.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.400
That's all good.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.400
And that GitHub is meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

31:11.400 --> 31:15.400
That right there is a packed housekeeping.

31:15.400 --> 31:24.400
We are cranking stuff out these days, and so we just try to let you know about it in the most efficient way possible without tying things down too much.

31:24.400 --> 31:28.400
So we are down here in the very, very warm Texas.

31:28.400 --> 31:32.400
It's 83 degrees in the studio right now as we record.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.400
How are you feeling, buddy?

31:33.400 --> 31:34.400
I'm feeling good.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.400
I think if you keep – I'm literally –

31:36.400 --> 31:37.400
You stop it.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.400
I have no shoes.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.400
You stop it.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.400
And I have one sock on.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.400
Cheese is taking one article of clothing off every time I complain about the heat.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.400
We're going to need special music for that.

31:45.400 --> 31:46.400
I know.

31:46.400 --> 31:47.400
It's brutal in here.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.400
I mean, there's no lie.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.400
It is brutal in here once the door is closed.

31:50.400 --> 31:51.400
Yeah, yeah.

31:51.400 --> 31:52.400
All right.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.400
Well, so let's talk about Texas Linux Fest.

31:53.400 --> 31:59.400
It's the little conference that could, and Elle is a volunteer there, so just full disclosure there.

31:59.400 --> 32:04.400
We do have an insider on the team, so we may be biased, but we've gone before.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.400
I think it's pretty great.

32:05.400 --> 32:09.400
And I want to start with the most important part, and that's the meetup, the dinner.

32:09.400 --> 32:10.400
It's meetup time.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.400
We're at the Hard 8 standing next to the smoker right now.

32:13.400 --> 32:18.400
I'd say it's about 120 degrees or so here, and the room is filled with smoke.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.400
You walk in and it's nothing but smoke.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.400
It's going to be a good meetup.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.400
I think this whole aisle of people now is us, too.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.400
I think we've basically taken over the restaurant.

32:26.400 --> 32:27.400
Yeah.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.400
Yeah, we had about three or four tables at least.

32:29.400 --> 32:34.400
People were slamming down some good food and some new friends, some old friends.

32:34.400 --> 32:38.400
And thank you to Elle because she made sure that we actually tried to socialize with everybody.

32:38.400 --> 32:41.400
Like, you tuned in on that right away that that needed to happen.

32:41.400 --> 32:43.400
So tip of the hat to you on that.

32:43.400 --> 32:47.400
You know, it was actually closer to five and seven tables at some time.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.400
That's awesome.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.400
That's awesome.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.400
It was great.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.400
It's so cool to go to a place like that and fill it up.

32:52.400 --> 32:58.400
And that location, I believe, was also Elle's idea because she had the brilliant idea of it's a line

32:58.400 --> 33:02.400
where you just go in, you get the food, you pay it yourself, and then you go sit down.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.400
Yeah, it was all a cart line.

33:03.400 --> 33:07.400
What I thought was super cool about it, too, is all of the sides were free.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.400
So, like, if you wanted the mac—did they tell you that?

33:09.400 --> 33:10.400
No.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.400
No, they did not tell me that.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.400
Maybe they're just free for cheese.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.400
He's got that smile, you know.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.400
Yeah, dude.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.400
Maybe they were.

33:16.400 --> 33:17.400
Maybe they just like you.

33:17.400 --> 33:18.400
Maybe they were.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.400
Sweetie.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.400
Maybe they were free cheese.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.400
I think you may have stolen sides.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.400
Oops.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.400
Dude, yeah.

33:24.400 --> 33:25.400
Well, I mean, I went to the counter.

33:25.400 --> 33:26.400
She didn't charge me.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.400
I paid like 36 bucks.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.400
That's not just for the meat.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.400
Oh, dude, yeah.

33:29.400 --> 33:30.400
For meat, I mean, it was like 50 bucks.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.400
Oh, yeah.

33:31.400 --> 33:32.400
Yeah, but, you know.

33:32.400 --> 33:33.400
I mean, it's—

33:33.400 --> 33:34.400
It was solid.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.400
I had to try the mac and cheese.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.400
I had to try the—

33:36.400 --> 33:37.400
The brisket was solid.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.400
The ribs were okay.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.400
The ribs were all right, yeah.

33:39.400 --> 33:40.400
The sausage was okay.

33:40.400 --> 33:44.400
I didn't get any sausage, but I did get bacon-wrapped jalapenos.

33:44.400 --> 33:47.400
I have a six-word review of Dallas Barbecue.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.400
It's good.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.400
It's not Austin.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.400
It's good.

33:51.400 --> 33:52.400
Yeah.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.400
It's okay.

33:53.400 --> 33:54.400
Maybe that's an eight-word review.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.400
That's how I would—

33:55.400 --> 33:58.400
Yeah, I was about to say, I think you're going over six words, bro.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.400
Okay.

33:59.400 --> 34:02.600
So, anyways, let's talk about the actual event.

34:02.600 --> 34:04.540
And we had a good time.

34:04.540 --> 34:09.320
We just probably partied a little too hardy that night, and we woke up the next day, which

34:09.320 --> 34:10.320
was Saturday.

34:10.320 --> 34:13.800
The first day was Friday, which is kind of slow, usually is on these conferences.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.000
Go to the meetup.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.560
Then the morning rolls around a little too soon.

34:19.560 --> 34:20.560
Oh, good morning.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.680
It's day two of Texas Linux Fest 2019.

34:22.680 --> 34:23.680
It's Saturday.

34:23.680 --> 34:25.960
Mr. Cheese Bacon's arriving with the swag for our booth.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.800
I think today's going to be the real day.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.800
I think.

34:29.800 --> 34:30.800
So today, I got here a little early.

34:30.800 --> 34:34.520
While they're setting up, I'm going to sneak into the ballroom, and I'm going to try to

34:34.520 --> 34:38.400
plug my recorder into their audio system so I can record the keynote for them.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.960
This is something they asked me to do.

34:39.960 --> 34:40.960
And we're going to give it a go.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.760
We're going to MacGyver this thing.

34:42.760 --> 34:44.760
Hey, good morning Cheezy.

34:44.760 --> 34:45.760
How are you?

34:45.760 --> 34:46.760
Good.

34:46.760 --> 34:51.640
I'm alive on the outside, and I'm dead on the inside.

34:51.640 --> 34:53.040
That's not new, right?

34:53.040 --> 34:54.120
That's nothing new.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.600
I got no sleep last night.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.000
I got no sleep, and none.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.920
So I might try to sneak out of here later today and take a nap.

35:02.920 --> 35:06.720
Did you get the get together for the audio for the keynote?

35:06.720 --> 35:08.200
No, I got to go do that.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.320
I got to go do that.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.560
So I did go do that.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.320
I took the nap after the keynote.

35:12.320 --> 35:18.440
Boy, am I glad I was able to hook my recorder directly into the board, the house audio.

35:18.440 --> 35:21.640
Big thank you to Texas Linux Fest for making this happen.

35:21.640 --> 35:23.480
And Thomas got up on stage.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.040
Remember, what was Thomas's last name?

35:25.040 --> 35:26.040
Remember?

35:26.040 --> 35:27.040
Cameron.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.040
Thomas Cameron.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.040
He's a little bit older than me.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.280
He's probably about five, five, 10 years.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.280
Maybe not.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.280
Maybe probably not that far.

35:33.280 --> 35:34.280
But he's about five years older than me.

35:34.280 --> 35:37.760
Got a little more gray in the beard than I do, but mine's coming right along.

35:37.760 --> 35:43.160
And so he is quite literally a gray beard, and he starts to share a few stories that

35:43.160 --> 35:47.000
make us nostalgic for the bad old days of Linux.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.800
In the early days, does anyone remember XF86 config?

35:50.800 --> 35:52.200
Right?

35:52.200 --> 35:56.040
You would have to run XF86 config before you could start X.

35:56.040 --> 36:00.880
And you had to tell X, you had to generate a config file.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.300
You had to define the mode lines.

36:02.300 --> 36:04.860
You had to define X and Y, start and stop.

36:04.860 --> 36:07.340
You had to define the refresh rate.

36:07.340 --> 36:09.020
You had to define all this kind of stuff.

36:09.020 --> 36:13.640
You could literally go in and tell the electron gun to shoot to the left or to the right or

36:13.640 --> 36:18.880
up or down and even to keystone and to, you know, do the in and out and all that stuff.

36:18.880 --> 36:26.520
And if you didn't pay attention to the warnings, you could get a 14-inch monitor that said

36:26.520 --> 36:31.640
it was good for 800 by 600 and go, I wonder if it will do 1024 by 768.

36:31.640 --> 36:36.800
And XF86 config would go, yeah, sure, let's try it.

36:36.800 --> 36:37.800
Start X.

36:37.800 --> 36:38.800
Oh, crap!

36:38.800 --> 36:39.800
Yeah, it was rough.

36:39.800 --> 36:49.800
He also talked about win modems and all the other things we had to battle and how hard

36:49.800 --> 36:52.720
it was to find other community members to connect with.

36:52.720 --> 36:55.240
How many folks remember using Claws?

36:55.240 --> 36:56.240
Yeah.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.240
SilFeed?

36:57.240 --> 37:04.440
For those of you who are younger than my IT career, these are old open source tools that

37:04.440 --> 37:06.200
we used to access Usenet.

37:06.200 --> 37:12.520
Usenet was sort of like a precursor to bulletin boards, I guess, or mailing lists.

37:12.520 --> 37:18.980
But so you would use Usenet and you could post questions and people would reply.

37:18.980 --> 37:25.720
And the thing that was amazing was I would see people replying whose names I saw scrolling

37:25.720 --> 37:29.160
by as the colonel booted.

37:29.160 --> 37:35.120
That was pretty amazing that the people who were helping were literally the folks who

37:35.120 --> 37:36.680
were writing the code.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.480
And they were willing to help.

37:39.480 --> 37:45.280
And Usenet is where I started to understand what open source was really about.

37:45.280 --> 37:53.580
And he had a couple of messages that were pretty on the nose for an old timer to make

37:53.580 --> 37:54.960
about today.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.480
People would ask, what's the best distro?

37:56.480 --> 37:58.200
Which distro should I use?

37:58.200 --> 37:59.200
What's going on?

37:59.200 --> 38:01.160
Well, thank you very much for asking.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.320
Let me just tell you.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.760
What's the best distro?

38:05.760 --> 38:09.560
You want enterprise support and a really long life cycle, well, clearly Red Hat Enterprise

38:09.560 --> 38:11.400
Linux is the best distro.

38:11.400 --> 38:15.360
You want enterprise support and maybe not as long, but really good community and really

38:15.360 --> 38:20.520
docs, well, obviously LTS Ubuntu is the best distro.

38:20.520 --> 38:25.120
Do you want the latest and greatest packages, bleeding edge technology that's really, really

38:25.120 --> 38:30.400
close to upstream, well, obviously Fedora is the best distro.

38:30.400 --> 38:35.880
Do you want a stable long term release but you don't want to pay for it, well, clearly

38:35.880 --> 38:38.520
CentOS is the best distro.

38:38.520 --> 38:42.800
Do you want an amazing desktop experience that just works, has all the multimedia, everything

38:42.800 --> 38:47.520
is fine and flashy and you just click next, next, next and it's fine, well, obviously

38:47.520 --> 38:50.040
Linux Mint is the best distro.

38:50.040 --> 38:54.560
Do you want a distro that's optimized for cloud computing and virtualization workloads,

38:54.560 --> 38:57.320
well, clearly Amazon Linux is the best distro.

38:57.320 --> 39:04.360
Do you want a highly technical distribution for power users that is insanely configurable,

39:04.360 --> 39:12.360
well, Gentoo is clearly the best distro, except, wait a minute, maybe Linux from scratch may

39:12.360 --> 39:22.000
make more sense, and you remember I was talking about the easy to use, maybe MX Linux or Monjaro,

39:22.000 --> 39:30.440
maybe that might, hmm, you know what, folks, adopting a distro like a religion is stupid.

39:30.440 --> 39:36.000
I've been guilty, I'm not saying I'm not stupid, I'm saying I've gotten enough scars that I

39:36.000 --> 39:38.440
don't do that anymore.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.680
Try a bunch of them.

39:40.680 --> 39:43.560
Force yourself to learn them.

39:43.560 --> 39:50.320
Put whatever, put Ubuntu on your machine exclusively, don't dual boot, put it on and force yourself

39:50.320 --> 39:56.400
to live with it for a month or two, then change over to Slackware, then change over to Centos,

39:56.400 --> 40:04.800
then change over to Arch, learn, get good at it so that you can have informed decisions.

40:04.800 --> 40:10.840
At the end of the day, folks, it's a kernel, GLib C or similar, the new utilities and a

40:10.840 --> 40:12.540
bunch of applications.

40:12.540 --> 40:18.240
The best distro is the one that does what you need at the best cost.

40:18.240 --> 40:19.240
You know?

40:19.240 --> 40:23.880
So, I'm kind of done with that, that whole mine's better than yours thing.

40:23.880 --> 40:28.200
I agreed with a point in that clip so much, I pulled it for the soundboard.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.120
Adopting a distro like a religion is stupid.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.120
Love it.

40:31.120 --> 40:34.120
Can I get an amen to that?

40:34.120 --> 40:35.120
Amen.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.120
That is so true.

40:36.120 --> 40:37.500
So this is where the talk starts to get really good.

40:37.500 --> 40:41.480
You can see he's starting to get fired up and it feels like he's right.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.760
I mean, the man knows his stuff.

40:43.760 --> 40:49.200
Cameron worked for 16 years at Red Hat, he now works at AWS on Amazon Linux.

40:49.200 --> 40:53.760
He's followed this stuff for a really long time.

40:53.760 --> 40:58.620
And when he started, it was a very specific group of people that were in the room trying

40:58.620 --> 41:00.620
to solve a specific set of problems.

41:00.620 --> 41:06.440
And he puts up a picture of an old 90s Linux user group up on the screen.

41:06.440 --> 41:10.200
Who were we back in the 90s?

41:10.200 --> 41:13.560
What do you see on this page?

41:13.560 --> 41:15.960
They're all gray beards.

41:15.960 --> 41:18.840
Like me, I have become.

41:18.840 --> 41:23.360
But more importantly, what do we not see?

41:23.360 --> 41:28.960
People of color, women, young people.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.520
That's a big problem, folks.

41:30.520 --> 41:33.720
And he makes a point that really stuck with me.

41:33.720 --> 41:38.900
That diversity and inclusion goes beyond the things that you can see with your eyes.

41:38.900 --> 41:45.840
And it's not just about LGBT or women, or it's also about disabilities, right?

41:45.840 --> 41:50.880
And disabilities don't just mean the ones that you can see, okay?

41:50.880 --> 41:53.280
Neurodiversity is a really important topic.

41:53.280 --> 41:58.800
There are a lot of folks who are terrified to talk about things like mental health issues

41:58.800 --> 42:01.300
in tech, right?

42:01.300 --> 42:04.060
I have bipolar, folks.

42:04.060 --> 42:07.160
It's scary to say that.

42:07.160 --> 42:11.440
But it's important to break down the barriers.

42:11.440 --> 42:14.640
Mine's controlled by medication, thank God.

42:14.640 --> 42:19.520
But people need to feel safe in tech.

42:19.520 --> 42:23.800
And we as a community have done a phenomenal job in the past of bringing people in and

42:23.800 --> 42:24.880
including them.

42:24.880 --> 42:25.880
Let's extend that.

42:25.880 --> 42:27.560
Man, that point hit me hard.

42:27.560 --> 42:28.560
Oh, yeah.

42:28.560 --> 42:34.440
And I liked the way that he presented, where he almost felt like he tricked us a little

42:34.440 --> 42:35.440
bit, right?

42:35.440 --> 42:40.160
Like he brought us into this kind of nostalgic zone, and through his experience-

42:40.160 --> 42:42.160
Talking about the old times, man.

42:42.160 --> 42:45.960
I think he was working at Microsoft at one point during the 95 release he had mentioned

42:45.960 --> 42:46.960
to.

42:46.960 --> 42:54.680
But he kind of walked us through this path of his own path into where we are today.

42:54.680 --> 42:59.580
He even had comment about what some would consider hipsters, right?

42:59.580 --> 43:05.280
And how they're actually super smart kids that are getting into this industry.

43:05.280 --> 43:11.100
So that we really need to embrace, and we really need to diversify our community.

43:11.100 --> 43:14.840
And that's just going to make for a better community at the end of the day, was one of

43:14.840 --> 43:16.920
the real things that I took away from that.

43:16.920 --> 43:24.680
And I like the way he kind of frames it in a way that's easy for us all to understand.

43:24.680 --> 43:29.360
Even if you don't have a empathetic connection with people in these situations, I think there's

43:29.360 --> 43:32.840
a way to phrase this all that helps us all better understand it.

43:32.840 --> 43:37.320
There's a really, really cool thing that I see here.

43:37.320 --> 43:39.280
There are people of color.

43:39.280 --> 43:40.840
There are women.

43:40.840 --> 43:42.840
There are folks with disabilities.

43:42.840 --> 43:45.480
We are getting more inclusive.

43:45.480 --> 43:51.120
We're not there yet, but we're getting more inclusive, and that is phenomenal.

43:51.120 --> 43:54.360
There's still a lot of room for improvement in diversity and inclusion, and I think that

43:54.360 --> 43:57.620
we need to pay attention to that.

43:57.620 --> 44:00.920
And I want to make something really clear.

44:00.920 --> 44:04.540
Diversity is inviting someone to the dance.

44:04.540 --> 44:06.860
And I talk to folks and they're like, oh, no, no, we work for diversity.

44:06.860 --> 44:10.660
We have hiring requirements that, you know, X percentage of people who come in are people

44:10.660 --> 44:14.360
of color or women or disabled or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

44:14.360 --> 44:16.900
Okay, that's fine.

44:16.900 --> 44:18.940
Inclusion is asking them to dance.

44:18.940 --> 44:25.940
I know that's true because I have met so many audience members when we go out that are too

44:25.940 --> 44:27.880
shy to come out.

44:27.880 --> 44:32.640
They've traveled in some cases from parts all around the world and they finally get

44:32.640 --> 44:37.360
there and there's a big group of us, and they shut down and they turn around.

44:37.360 --> 44:43.980
What's amazing about this, even well-known, established people in the community have this

44:43.980 --> 44:44.980
happen to them.

44:44.980 --> 44:49.520
And so I, and Elle's even better at this than I am, try to go out of my way to when

44:49.520 --> 44:54.440
I see that happen, I try to invite them to the conversation.

44:54.440 --> 44:59.780
I try to invite them to the group that has formed around us that is chatting with us.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.300
And you've seen this, right, Elle, at events all the time?

45:02.300 --> 45:07.260
I think the hardest one is when you want to approach them, but you kind of feel like you're

45:07.260 --> 45:08.780
going to scare them off.

45:08.780 --> 45:13.140
So it's kind of just changing your body language to make them feel included more than even,

45:13.140 --> 45:14.720
you know, approaching them vocally.

45:14.720 --> 45:16.700
And I think that's an important note to make for people.

45:16.700 --> 45:17.700
Right.

45:17.700 --> 45:18.700
They're anxious.

45:18.700 --> 45:22.820
They're anxious about it, you know, and when you can put yourself in that, when you understand

45:22.820 --> 45:27.980
that to them, it's a very anxiety inducing situation to try to be included in a group

45:27.980 --> 45:28.980
we're currently not in.

45:28.980 --> 45:31.300
And for some people, it's nearly impossible.

45:31.300 --> 45:32.300
Absolutely.

45:32.300 --> 45:38.060
And I think, you know, Cameron, Thomas Cameron really touched on that in saying that all

45:38.060 --> 45:41.760
disabilities aren't disabilities that you can see, right?

45:41.760 --> 45:51.300
And so we, you don't really know and you shouldn't guess, but you should at least make, you know,

45:51.300 --> 45:56.380
a real opportunity to try and connect with those people because those people are likely

45:56.380 --> 45:59.220
to have a lot of knowledge that you would appreciate as well.

45:59.220 --> 46:00.940
And there's ways to do that online too.

46:00.940 --> 46:02.540
It's not just about at events.

46:02.540 --> 46:03.540
It's a good reminder.

46:03.540 --> 46:07.580
We should all, you know, just take a second and consider that everyone has different paths

46:07.580 --> 46:08.700
to wherever you are.

46:08.700 --> 46:14.060
And it's pretty easy to just extend a hand here or there or, you know, just even think

46:14.060 --> 46:18.260
like this person has a different perspective than I do and how can I interface that?

46:18.260 --> 46:23.140
Because as you said, Chris, you know, anytime we go to these events, eventually, you know,

46:23.140 --> 46:25.100
things improve or you meet new people.

46:25.100 --> 46:28.620
And regardless of how that happens, I don't think any of that has ever been bad, right?

46:28.620 --> 46:31.860
It's only a good experience when you can reach out and meet new people.

46:31.860 --> 46:36.220
I really liked his message when it came to diversity because he talked about actually

46:36.220 --> 46:39.060
inviting people, you know, to dance instead of just to the dance.

46:39.060 --> 46:40.620
And I know this is something I experienced.

46:40.620 --> 46:45.860
I have a loud personality when I'm on, when I'm doing my talks, but I tend to try to fade

46:45.860 --> 46:47.700
into the background.

46:47.700 --> 46:50.820
And I've been very appreciative of the people are like, you know what?

46:50.820 --> 46:51.820
Actually talk to Elle.

46:51.820 --> 46:54.640
They don't speak for me and they bring me into a conversation.

46:54.640 --> 46:57.060
It just makes me feel included in the community.

46:57.060 --> 47:01.700
Yeah, Listener Steve had a good talk about different personality types and how that can

47:01.700 --> 47:02.700
make a big difference.

47:02.700 --> 47:05.260
I think it's something he'll be giving more talks on in the future.

47:05.260 --> 47:10.600
I would love to see him do like a YouTube video on that or something like that and link

47:10.600 --> 47:13.620
that out so that people can actually consume that.

47:13.620 --> 47:15.180
I think that would be a great avenue for that.

47:15.180 --> 47:16.660
Should have said that to him.

47:16.660 --> 47:17.660
All right.

47:17.660 --> 47:22.500
Then this was really a State of the Union talk that was being given and I really thought

47:22.500 --> 47:24.900
Thomas had a good kind of way to look towards the future too.

47:24.900 --> 47:28.240
And obviously working at Amazon, he comes at it from a certain perspective.

47:28.240 --> 47:30.840
So take that into consideration.

47:30.840 --> 47:36.660
But there was a harsh reality that has been setting in for me personally this entire year.

47:36.660 --> 47:43.700
As I've gone to all of these events this year, I felt something that I felt before, but it's

47:43.700 --> 47:51.380
been so long that I couldn't name it until after this talk.

47:51.380 --> 47:59.220
And what Thomas essentially is about to say is that the Linux admin is going the way of

47:59.220 --> 48:01.020
the Unix admin.

48:01.020 --> 48:05.620
There will always be some, but in the next five to 10 years, there's going to be a lot

48:05.620 --> 48:06.620
less.

48:06.620 --> 48:09.500
Then I backed off and I said, well, just give me all Linux in Austin.

48:09.500 --> 48:11.500
And I was like, man, that's pretty cool.

48:11.500 --> 48:13.060
1500 results for Linux.

48:13.060 --> 48:16.220
That's developers, admins, sales, whatever.

48:16.220 --> 48:17.660
He's doing job searches.

48:17.660 --> 48:21.640
This is a screen that he has up and he's showing the results as he does different searches

48:21.640 --> 48:23.240
for Linux jobs in Austin.

48:23.240 --> 48:29.500
And then I did the same thing for cloud, 4,000 just in Austin.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.620
4,000 jobs in Austin.

48:31.620 --> 48:38.720
In Dallas, in the DFW Metroplex, it's more by a bunch.

48:38.720 --> 48:43.260
Employers expect cloud competency.

48:43.260 --> 48:47.820
Linux is a huge underlying component of that.

48:47.820 --> 48:51.540
So I'm not at all saying screw Linux, go cloud.

48:51.540 --> 48:56.780
No, what I'm saying is you have an advantage right now.

48:56.780 --> 49:00.100
But you need to understand all the things that Linux does.

49:00.100 --> 49:01.900
Sort of architecturally, right?

49:01.900 --> 49:07.580
You need to actually understand networking because cloud is very much about networking,

49:07.580 --> 49:11.660
setting up virtual private clouds and subnets and things like that.

49:11.660 --> 49:13.540
You need to understand storage.

49:13.540 --> 49:15.700
And I mean block storage.

49:15.700 --> 49:20.420
I mean file storage like NFS and Gluster and things like that.

49:20.420 --> 49:21.860
And also object storage.

49:21.860 --> 49:23.600
You need to understand those technologies.

49:23.600 --> 49:25.740
Those are all built on Linux, folks.

49:25.740 --> 49:27.060
But understand them.

49:27.060 --> 49:29.620
You need to understand application services.

49:29.620 --> 49:34.880
Because the days of somebody who just does Linux are gone.

49:34.880 --> 49:41.220
You need to at the very least understand the concepts of programming and software development.

49:41.220 --> 49:42.860
His point is so, so great.

49:42.860 --> 49:44.220
It's cloud.

49:44.220 --> 49:47.900
You can demystify it by realizing it's just a series of different components.

49:47.900 --> 49:52.340
Storage, networking, Linux is a huge part of that security.

49:52.340 --> 49:58.900
And as a Linux admin or user today, you've already mastered or are near competent in

49:58.900 --> 50:01.220
the most critical aspect of that stack.

50:01.220 --> 50:05.740
You're in a great spot to leverage that and just be ready for the way things are going.

50:05.740 --> 50:09.540
But a cloud admin, cloud architect, cloud engineer.

50:09.540 --> 50:12.740
These are the terms that employers are hiring for now.

50:12.740 --> 50:18.740
And it's mind blowing to me because I realized I'm witnessing another industry transition

50:18.740 --> 50:25.620
like I saw from Unix to NT and Linux and from Windows servers to Linux servers.

50:25.620 --> 50:30.220
I'm now seeing, well, essentially services, hosted services, either as people roll their

50:30.220 --> 50:33.140
own or they use a commercial cloud provider.

50:33.140 --> 50:37.100
Something else he talked about in that slide is he showed how many data centers companies

50:37.100 --> 50:40.380
are building has just significantly dropped over the years.

50:40.380 --> 50:41.380
Yep.

50:41.380 --> 50:48.140
And I think that that's one of those topics that might be hard and might be unbelievable

50:48.140 --> 50:49.860
to some people.

50:49.860 --> 50:52.260
So I encourage you to go out there and do your own search.

50:52.260 --> 50:53.260
Yeah.

50:53.260 --> 50:59.380
Now, we did capture that audio of this talk and Mike, Linux Academy training architect,

50:59.380 --> 51:00.780
captured some video of it.

51:00.780 --> 51:02.000
He mashed those up.

51:02.000 --> 51:05.140
So we have the audio from the house system and the video from his camera.

51:05.140 --> 51:07.980
And we're going to get that over to Carl at Texas Linux Fest.

51:07.980 --> 51:11.500
When they have that posted online, we will retroactively update our show notes with a

51:11.500 --> 51:13.620
link to that so you can watch the entire talk.

51:13.620 --> 51:14.620
So that should be out soon.

51:14.620 --> 51:15.620
Yeah.

51:15.620 --> 51:16.620
It's really good.

51:16.620 --> 51:17.620
You absolutely should watch that talk.

51:17.620 --> 51:19.300
Elle, I think you and I thought it was one of the better talks we'd seen in years.

51:19.300 --> 51:23.780
I think right when it was done, I looked over at you and went, that is the talk I've always

51:23.780 --> 51:24.940
wanted to be able to give.

51:24.940 --> 51:28.020
I actually remember you saying that exact thing, Elle.

51:28.020 --> 51:29.020
Mm-hmm.

51:29.020 --> 51:31.300
I went up to him and I said, how many times have you given this talk?

51:31.300 --> 51:32.300
It was just incredible.

51:32.300 --> 51:33.860
This is the first time I've ever given it.

51:33.860 --> 51:34.860
Solid.

51:34.860 --> 51:36.720
I finished it this morning.

51:36.720 --> 51:37.980
He was just so passionate about that.

51:37.980 --> 51:43.940
Well, and it should be said, too, that Carl George there in the IRC and in the Jupyter

51:43.940 --> 51:48.940
broadcasting world, he actually helped throw that together, I think, five days before or

51:48.940 --> 51:49.940
something like that.

51:49.940 --> 51:50.940
Oh, yeah.

51:50.940 --> 51:51.940
Oh, that's the thing about...

51:51.940 --> 51:52.940
And it just...

51:52.940 --> 51:53.940
You wouldn't have known.

51:53.940 --> 51:54.940
That's the thing about Texas Linux Fest.

51:54.940 --> 51:55.940
In fact...

51:55.940 --> 51:56.940
No, I had like a full month.

51:56.940 --> 52:01.220
Guys like Carl and folks like, well, everybody that volunteers, like Elle, everybody that

52:01.220 --> 52:02.780
participates makes it possible.

52:02.780 --> 52:04.140
I mean, they're all volunteers.

52:04.140 --> 52:05.140
Yeah.

52:05.140 --> 52:06.140
And that's...

52:06.140 --> 52:07.140
I want to...

52:07.140 --> 52:08.140
This is my last clip.

52:08.140 --> 52:10.740
This was our final thoughts as all of the booths were being teared down.

52:10.740 --> 52:15.260
As we watched Chaz from Linux Academy do all the hard work, I fired up the microphone and

52:15.260 --> 52:17.200
captured my final thoughts of the event.

52:17.200 --> 52:23.100
Here we are at the end of Texas Linux Fest, the plucky little Linux conference that could...

52:23.100 --> 52:27.380
I think it's kind of like your favorite distro that's not doing super good, but you still

52:27.380 --> 52:30.700
love it and you want other people to try it out because they've done something that's

52:30.700 --> 52:33.700
kind of nice and different than the other distributions.

52:33.700 --> 52:35.220
That's Texas Linux Fest.

52:35.220 --> 52:37.900
And as a Linux user, something about that draws me in.

52:37.900 --> 52:40.980
Day two, you know, now that we're at the end, like literally everything's all packed up

52:40.980 --> 52:42.180
and we're just clearing out.

52:42.180 --> 52:46.820
I would just say day two, I think, was really kind of hopping compared to day one.

52:46.820 --> 52:50.880
All the talks you really wanted to see were on Saturday, sometimes a little jammed together.

52:50.880 --> 52:51.880
But I think we've...

52:51.880 --> 52:54.660
I think that sort of motivated us to have conversations in the future about how to make

52:54.660 --> 52:57.140
this stuff more generally available for people.

52:57.140 --> 52:58.140
So that's nice.

52:58.140 --> 53:00.420
And it was always good to see people make friends.

53:00.420 --> 53:01.420
Yeah.

53:01.420 --> 53:05.060
Well, like this was your second Texas Linux Fest, you and I both went to the one in Austin

53:05.060 --> 53:06.060
last year.

53:06.060 --> 53:07.300
Did you have some time to reflect on this?

53:07.300 --> 53:09.100
Any thoughts about this year's Fest?

53:09.100 --> 53:10.340
It was great.

53:10.340 --> 53:15.460
I really enjoyed the new venue, although the barbecue was, you know, a couple of notches

53:15.460 --> 53:16.460
down.

53:16.460 --> 53:18.180
The actual conference itself was great.

53:18.180 --> 53:22.500
I gave a talk for only the second time ever in public, so that was scary.

53:22.500 --> 53:28.020
And it was cool to, you know, talk with lots of other people about home automation stuff.

53:28.020 --> 53:31.500
I kind of agree with your assessment, it's the plucky little Linux conference that can

53:31.500 --> 53:32.500
though.

53:32.500 --> 53:33.500
It was only...

53:33.500 --> 53:36.020
It felt like three or four hundred people turned up.

53:36.020 --> 53:40.040
And Friday was really quiet compared to the Saturday, like you've said as well.

53:40.040 --> 53:42.140
But I had a great time.

53:42.140 --> 53:46.940
And I just see Elle in the chat has just said, why are Alex and I always scheduled to speak

53:46.940 --> 53:47.940
at the same time?

53:47.940 --> 53:48.940
I know.

53:48.940 --> 53:50.420
I'd love to go and hear Elle speak.

53:50.420 --> 53:53.780
And by the way, if you ever get a chance, she is a fantastic speaker.

53:53.780 --> 53:54.780
Yeah.

53:54.780 --> 53:55.900
Elle, you packed the room.

53:55.900 --> 53:59.500
You crushed it with the confessions of a sysadmin talk this year.

53:59.500 --> 54:01.980
How did you feel like the conference went from your perspective?

54:01.980 --> 54:04.660
You know, this is my third year to be involved.

54:04.660 --> 54:09.420
And it's always the hardest conference for me because it is smaller than all the other

54:09.420 --> 54:10.420
ones that I attend.

54:10.420 --> 54:13.540
But, you know, you go to a conference and you get the schedule and you're like, oh,

54:13.540 --> 54:16.760
there's one talk here, another talk here, I'll do the hallway track.

54:16.760 --> 54:21.460
This is three or four talks that I want to be at every single time.

54:21.460 --> 54:26.360
So I never feel like there's enough of me to go around, and sometimes I really wish

54:26.360 --> 54:31.420
people wouldn't show up to my talk because I could sneak away and go to somebody else's.

54:31.420 --> 54:33.380
If nobody makes it, I'm going to sneak out.

54:33.380 --> 54:35.340
The quality of speakers.

54:35.340 --> 54:36.340
I don't know.

54:36.340 --> 54:42.160
I'm not involved in that process, but they do an amazing job of getting a diverse variety

54:42.160 --> 54:46.860
of topics when it comes to not just Linux, but just the open source community as a whole.

54:46.860 --> 54:50.860
Yeah, something they did that's a little different, seen in a couple other places, but I like

54:50.860 --> 54:51.860
their take on it.

54:51.860 --> 54:56.140
They had a few workshop talks that were specific, longer talks that had follow along components.

54:56.140 --> 55:00.120
And the one that I went to was from Ansible Basics to Brilliance.

55:00.120 --> 55:02.460
And there was a spot where the speaker just sort of stopped and said, all right, here's

55:02.460 --> 55:03.460
where you get the VM.

55:03.460 --> 55:04.460
Here's the instructions.

55:04.460 --> 55:05.740
I'll take 10 minutes and go get going.

55:05.740 --> 55:09.420
Carl, what was the overall takeaway from the team?

55:09.420 --> 55:12.740
Did you guys break even at least, and do you have a total number on attendees?

55:12.740 --> 55:13.740
Yes, sir.

55:13.740 --> 55:16.560
We had 274 total attendees.

55:16.560 --> 55:20.220
We finished just in the black as far as the financial side of it.

55:20.220 --> 55:23.700
So we'll have just a little bit of spare change to get started with next year.

55:23.700 --> 55:27.540
And hopefully we can get those attendance numbers up and we can bring in more speakers

55:27.540 --> 55:30.380
and more sponsors and have a little more options.

55:30.380 --> 55:31.380
Yeah, we'll see.

55:31.380 --> 55:33.100
There'll be something lost though.

55:33.100 --> 55:35.840
It'll be good overall for the health of the conference.

55:35.840 --> 55:40.540
But around 274, while that sounds like a big number, it makes it so that you basically

55:40.540 --> 55:43.460
kind of bump into the same people a couple of times.

55:43.460 --> 55:48.260
If you go to both days, by day two, you've seen some of the same faces and everybody

55:48.260 --> 55:53.140
is notably a little bit more chill, a little more comfortable with everybody because we've

55:53.140 --> 55:54.260
seen each other already.

55:54.260 --> 55:55.260
We've been around.

55:55.260 --> 55:56.740
We've been in the same room a few times.

55:56.740 --> 56:00.460
Well, I think that opens up time to where if you see someone standing in the hallway

56:00.460 --> 56:05.260
that and you were in their track the day before, that you can go up and talk to them and maybe

56:05.260 --> 56:10.940
you didn't get that one little piece or you're curious about the next step.

56:10.940 --> 56:12.740
It's a little more approachable.

56:12.740 --> 56:18.140
People are a little more approachable there when it's just not buzzing as heavily.

56:18.140 --> 56:23.860
For me, that's the biggest comparison between something like Linux Fest Northwest and Texas

56:23.860 --> 56:28.220
is that, like you say, a smaller group, you end up seeing the same people two or three

56:28.220 --> 56:31.980
times, which sometimes, I mean, I struggle with names at the best of times.

56:31.980 --> 56:35.860
Sometimes that's a good thing because you can end up saying, oh, did you see this, one

56:35.860 --> 56:39.020
of these three or four talks that's going on and you can actually have a proper hallway

56:39.020 --> 56:45.660
track and the community down in Texas, there was a JB Telegram group for JB, Texas and

56:45.660 --> 56:50.860
there's a really great bunch of guys in there and lifelong friends made, I think.

56:50.860 --> 56:51.860
That is true.

56:51.860 --> 56:52.860
That is true.

56:52.860 --> 56:56.180
I mean, I think 14 of us went to lunch together on Saturday.

56:56.180 --> 57:00.140
15, yeah, 15 of us and way more at the meetup.

57:00.140 --> 57:01.340
But it's beyond that.

57:01.340 --> 57:04.680
It's like every year, I look forward to seeing Carl now.

57:04.680 --> 57:07.540
It's like you really do create.

57:07.540 --> 57:08.540
It's true, man.

57:08.540 --> 57:10.300
Well, he also brings solid jerky.

57:10.300 --> 57:11.300
He does always.

57:11.300 --> 57:13.180
Carl has the best meat sausage.

57:13.180 --> 57:17.380
Yeah, he does bring really good sausage.

57:17.380 --> 57:18.380
What can I say, man?

57:18.380 --> 57:20.380
I'm food motivated.

57:20.380 --> 57:24.020
I think the community is irreplaceable.

57:24.020 --> 57:26.460
The people that go to these events are great.

57:26.460 --> 57:28.100
They're sometimes a little awkward.

57:28.100 --> 57:32.120
They have their individual challenges, but it sort of all gets normalized out because

57:32.120 --> 57:37.740
everybody's a unique flower at this kind of thing, including me.

57:37.740 --> 57:41.220
And everybody just sort of looks past all that stuff.

57:41.220 --> 57:45.100
Everybody's accepted.

57:45.100 --> 57:46.100
It's so easy.

57:46.100 --> 57:48.980
If you want to be by yourself and not talk to anybody, you can do that.

57:48.980 --> 57:53.580
If you feel like just randomly going out with a group of people to a big old lunch and walking

57:53.580 --> 57:56.380
around town, you can do that too.

57:56.380 --> 58:00.300
And I hope wherever the conference goes, I hope that always stays.

58:00.300 --> 58:01.300
Absolutely.

58:01.300 --> 58:02.780
That's my favorite part about it.

58:02.780 --> 58:04.940
Oh, it was a good one, Wes.

58:04.940 --> 58:05.940
I missed having you there.

58:05.940 --> 58:07.380
But you know how great the community is.

58:07.380 --> 58:08.500
You've gone to plenty of these events now.

58:08.500 --> 58:09.980
You know how great everybody is.

58:09.980 --> 58:10.980
Yeah, absolutely.

58:10.980 --> 58:14.100
And you know, I liked what Alex said because sometimes you meet people and you learn their

58:14.100 --> 58:15.380
names and become long friends.

58:15.380 --> 58:19.340
But you also just have at those small conferences, people you run into as you go to the same

58:19.340 --> 58:20.340
couple of talks.

58:20.340 --> 58:25.020
And it's just sort of impromptu conference buddies because everyone you're with is motivated

58:25.020 --> 58:27.660
by if not the same thing, similar things.

58:27.660 --> 58:33.380
And there's just this sort of default friendliness that I think Thomas's whole talk is just saying

58:33.380 --> 58:35.180
we can take that to the next level.

58:35.180 --> 58:36.740
That's exactly it.

58:36.740 --> 58:42.740
We've all got common interests, and that is a great way to start conversation, to start

58:42.740 --> 58:46.020
inviting people to the dance because we've got the same common interests.

58:46.020 --> 58:47.020
Yep.

58:47.020 --> 58:48.020
All right.

58:48.020 --> 58:49.020
There you go.

58:49.020 --> 58:52.540
That's our report from Texas Linux Fest.

58:52.540 --> 59:01.160
Now, with all this traveling, seems like it's been a perfectly good time to do some reading.

59:01.160 --> 59:07.580
And Mr. Wes Payne comes in with a simple but modern e-book reader for the Linux desktop.

59:07.580 --> 59:09.140
This looks pretty nice, Wes.

59:09.140 --> 59:13.280
Yes, it does, Foliate, a simple and modern e-book viewer.

59:13.280 --> 59:16.420
And really, I don't need a lot of futz in my e-book reader.

59:16.420 --> 59:21.340
I just kind of want to open the book, be able to adjust the font, maybe have a dark theme

59:21.340 --> 59:22.340
possibly.

59:22.340 --> 59:24.540
And don't worry, Foliate does.

59:24.540 --> 59:28.700
Best of all, it's pretty easy to install because, hey, it's on flat back.

59:28.700 --> 59:33.060
So I got it installed right here on the studio machine as we were doing the show.

59:33.060 --> 59:40.340
Now, you may not like it because it does leverage some interesting open source, notably EPUB.js,

59:40.340 --> 59:45.140
which is a JavaScript library for handling EPUB readers, which means they didn't have

59:45.140 --> 59:46.340
to re-implement the whole thing.

59:46.340 --> 59:53.580
They're just using GTK WebKit to roll Gnome-style Electron app Lite.

59:53.580 --> 59:54.580
That's all right.

59:54.580 --> 59:55.580
It's all right.

59:55.580 --> 59:56.580
Don't worry.

59:56.580 --> 59:57.580
No, honestly, I think it's great.

59:57.580 --> 01:00:00.220
I think it's great that they can throw this together and not have to reinvent the wheel.

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:04.900
But it still has native integrations with GTK, so it feels like a nice nomap.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.420
Yeah, it really does.

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.420
It was a great pick, Wes.

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:08.420
Thank you.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:11.580
And you picked it just at the right time, so I was kind of like, I wouldn't mind having

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:14.640
because I have a recent collection of EPUBs.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.220
So it was really perfect for that.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:17.780
And sometimes your Kindle has to charge.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:21.340
So when do you get a Linux laptop?

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:24.420
I've got a couple of things that I want to cover in the post-show, so we should probably

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:27.240
get out of here pretty soon because I got a couple more clips.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:32.780
But I have a funny story that I thought, just as a perfect ending of the Texas Linux Fest

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:33.780
adventure.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:37.740
So we're down here, and it was right near the Linux Academy office.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:43.340
So Sunday after Texas Linux Fest, very conveniently, I was able to just jaunt over to the Keller

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.740
office and record this week's Linux action news.

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.640
I had a couple of stragglers with me, however.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.260
So we made the best of it.

01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:57.200
Cheese and Amanda, Cheese's wife, brought us to Waffle House, and I had my first Waffle

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.620
House experience, which was delightful.

01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:00.620
Alex was there as well.

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:02.100
What did you think, Alex?

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:05.340
Dirty, delicious, greasy, and delicious.

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.340
That's it.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.340
That's it.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.340
Nailed it.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:13.940
And then, to make it even better, while I'm recording or getting ready to record the show,

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:17.620
Cheese busts out his portable grill that he brought with him from home.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:18.620
What?

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.620
Of course I did.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:21.660
And the brats that he brought with him from home.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:22.660
Of course I did.

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:24.660
Talking about that full-size Washington grill?

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:25.660
Yeah.

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:26.660
Yeah.

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:27.660
Exactly, Carl.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:28.660
It was a full-size Washington grill.

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:32.860
It's like a little Coleman grill, and he cooked us up some brats while I recorded Linux action

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.660
news in the Linux Academy parking lot.

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:36.660
Yeah.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.660
I don't think Anthony knows about that.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.660
I haven't mentioned it yet.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:39.660
No.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.660
I mean, I cleaned up after myself and stuff.

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:42.660
Yeah, you did.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:47.460
The office might have smelt, at least the common area might have smelt like smoked meats

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:48.460
on Monday morning.

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.460
Yeah.

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:53.060
If we had a meat counter on the Texas episode, how many we'd have?

01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:54.060
Oh, man.

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.060
Oh, dude.

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.060
I got to eat a salad.

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.060
That's what I...

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.060
All right.

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:00.220
Well, that'll be it for the official show.

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.620
We got a couple of things in the post-show that I want to play for you.

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.860
But if you're getting out of here, I just got a couple of bits of advice, some pro tips

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:06.860
for you.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:07.860
Go to linuxunplug.com.

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:13.260
You can go to slash 304 for this episode or any of the episodes in the past, slash subscribe

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:19.020

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.020

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:25.260
And then you can catch this show live on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv.

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.580
Thanks so much for joining us.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:52.460
See you back here next Tuesday.

01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:04.180
I got to get everybody to go over to jbtitles.com and vote.

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:08.540
But I did save two bonus clips from the talk that I liked a lot that I wanted to play in

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:14.180
the post-show for those of you that were savvy enough to stick around, jbtitles.com.

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.180
Everybody go vote.

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:16.180
Cheesy, you seen any titles over there?

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:17.180
I'm going.

01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:18.180
I'm heading.

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:19.180
Get your vote on.

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:20.180
All right.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.300
So I thought this one was a fun story.

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:28.540
This was the moment where Thomas realized, screw this Windows NT crap, I'm leaving Microsoft

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:29.540
and I'm switching to Red Hat.

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.540
This is the moment.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:37.440
So playing around with Linux, you know, one of the things that actually blew me away that

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:46.620
made me convinced that maybe Tim was right was, and it's silly, echo one greater than

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:54.660
slash proc slash sys slash net slash IPv4 slash IP underscore forward.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:04:01.500
I could turn on and turn off routing in the kernel from the command line.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:06.220
And to really appreciate this, and I can appreciate this because I don't know if you know this

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.260
cheesy, but I am NT4 administrator certified.

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.260
Are you?

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.260
I am.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.260
Well, you know what I did learn about you?

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:13.260
What?

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.260
That you are also Citrix.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.740
I'm a Citrix certified engineer as well.

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:16.740
That's right.

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.740
Citrix.

01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:18.740
Look at you.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:22.340
And so anyways, you have to keep, you have to keep like the context in mind.

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:26.460
On my NT machine, if I had two network cards or I had a network card and a modem because

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:29.020
back then we, you know, we're working on modems.

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:34.180
If I had to turn routing on, it said, I've accepted your changes.

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:37.980
Now reboot that.

01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:42.760
I know it's silly, but that was one of the things that made me go, holy crap, this is

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.760
pretty cool.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.740
I know exactly how it feels actually.

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:51.300
Mine was, and I've told this story before, my holy crap, I'm switching to Linux moment,

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:57.460
was when I was first trying it out and I deleted my file system that was from a running computer

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.780
and it took me a solid few minutes before I even realized it.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:03.780
Like it was Gnome 2, like early Gnome 2 or whatever, maybe even something else that might

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:05.380
have been CD for all I remember.

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:09.540
Anyways, the desktop environment and my running programs remained functional for a few minutes

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.780
after I deleted the entire file system by mistake.

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:17.180
I don't know if somebody told me to do it or if I was just, I think I just fumbled the

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.340
RF command, but this was...

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.500
Did you say fumbled the RF command?

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.980
I mean, clearly you have no idea what you're doing.

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:29.420
RM, RM, RM dash RF I think is what I did and slash instead of like, you know, like maybe

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.740
I thought it was relative to my home directory.

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:32.740
I don't know what I thought.

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.620
Or maybe you thought you were in that directory or something.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:35.700
I mean, I don't know.

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:36.700
This was probably...

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:37.700
Textually in your home?

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.700
This was 97, 90, you know, ish, so I have 96.

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.860
You're trying to force that one directory that didn't want to delete to delete and you

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:43.860
deleted everything?

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.460
And I just sat down at this dude's computer.

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.460
It wasn't my computer.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.460
Wow.

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:51.300
Did you ever send him an apology letter?

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:55.180
No, cause he was cool with it cause he wanted to rebuild it anyways.

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:58.620
But that was the moment where I went, holy crap, this thing can delete itself.

01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:00.860
I'm switching to this.

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:01.860
This account's legit.

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:13.940
Your root account stuff is legit.
