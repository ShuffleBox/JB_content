WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.120
Okay Wes, I'm almost there. This will be the last machine, and then they're all

00:07.120 --> 00:17.320
gonna be Ubuntu. Are you ready? Oh yeah! What? Uh-oh. Oh no.

00:17.320 --> 00:36.640
We better ask Noah. This is Linux Unplugged episode 223 for November 14, 2017.

00:36.640 --> 00:41.440
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux sole injection. Now featuring a

00:41.440 --> 00:47.360
hundred percent more of Chris, Rekai, Wes, myself, and of course the Mumble Room. This

00:47.360 --> 00:55.000
hour we're going to take your phone calls, 1-855-450-6624, and welcome

00:55.000 --> 00:58.360
everyone. Welcome Chris, welcome Wes. I'm welcoming you guys to your own show. I'm

00:58.360 --> 01:02.640
kind of the guest, right? No, you're here Noah, and you're saving the day for us.

01:02.640 --> 01:09.360
It's a Fedora 27 Extravagant. Blowout! And you know what? It's funny, as a

01:09.360 --> 01:14.040
Fedora guy, I'm the only person as one of the hosts that's not actually running

01:14.040 --> 01:18.640
Fedora 27. So how pathetic is that? Noah, to make it up for you, all three of us are

01:18.640 --> 01:23.560
running 27 right now in the studio. How many people in the Mumble Room, hello

01:23.560 --> 01:33.400
Mumble Room, how many of you are running Fedora 27? Yep. Oh my gosh. Long day.

01:33.400 --> 01:38.280
Every day, all day, of course. Well I think this is going to be a super fun

01:38.280 --> 01:43.560
show. I don't, I think we've only done one other episode of Linux Unplugged where

01:43.560 --> 01:46.920
we've had a bunch of us all in the studio because sometimes it's not even,

01:46.920 --> 01:49.360
it's not even technically possible because there are only so many

01:49.360 --> 01:53.040
microphones that we have when we're all together, right? And so this is, and if

01:53.040 --> 01:56.040
I'm filling in, oftentimes you're out of town or you're traveling. So this is the

01:56.040 --> 01:58.520
first time we've actually gotten together for this, you know, big Linux

01:58.520 --> 02:03.880
party, so to speak. Yeah, it's pretty cool and we have a great turnout in the

02:03.880 --> 02:08.760
Mumble Room this week, including, I'm very excited to say, we have a special guest

02:08.760 --> 02:13.400
from the Fedora Project who will be chatting with us a little bit. Dan from

02:13.400 --> 02:17.960
Elementary OS just had himself quite the interview and we'll talk to Dan a little

02:17.960 --> 02:21.560
bit about that, but we also just have like a great showing, like Popey and

02:21.560 --> 02:25.360
Wimpy pulled themselves away from Rust to be here with us guys. I'm very excited

02:25.360 --> 02:29.360
about that. That's, that's great. And Kits and Kitty, I'm actually playing Rust whilst we're in the

02:29.360 --> 02:34.160
Mumble Room, by the way. Yeah, we didn't pull ourselves away. Yeah, okay. I should have known. And Kits and Kitty's here.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.320
I don't, I kept, Kits and Kitty, I can't remember how long it's been since you've

02:37.320 --> 02:40.280
been here, but I'm, it may even been last week, but I'm excited. Either way, Noah,

02:40.280 --> 02:44.840
it's gonna be a good show. I agree. So starting off, the first thing that

02:44.840 --> 02:49.120
we're talking about today is Firefox Quantum. So tell me, you know, as a

02:49.120 --> 02:52.120
Firefox user, you get to enlighten me because I don't know what Firefox

02:52.120 --> 02:57.880
Quantum is. Oh geez. Oh, oh, it's, it's Quantum Day, Noah. It's not, it's not

02:57.880 --> 03:05.000
just Firefox 57. Today is and shall ever be remembered as Quantum Day. And it's,

03:05.000 --> 03:09.960
this is it. This is where Mozilla realized that they could bunch up a bunch

03:09.960 --> 03:13.800
of features all at once and actually get everybody excited about their browser

03:13.800 --> 03:19.080
for a chance, for a change, and really make a big splash. No, no, no, no. I'm not

03:19.080 --> 03:22.480
being critical. What I'm saying is Mozilla really figured this shit out. Like,

03:22.480 --> 03:27.280
okay, they have, they have staged a bunch of fundamental changes to the browser. A

03:27.280 --> 03:32.400
new UI. They've switched back to Google for the default search. And the Quantum

03:32.400 --> 03:38.080
part, the Quantum part refers to a brand new way of getting shit done in Firefox.

03:38.080 --> 03:43.320
It's twice as fast as the previous version of Firefox. It has a new CSS

03:43.320 --> 03:48.040
engine, supports multi-process architecture so you can prioritize for

03:48.040 --> 03:53.080
different CPUs, different jobs. You can have properly sandboxed and isolated

03:53.080 --> 04:00.600
tabs. And it is significantly faster for the same, essentially, yes, for

04:00.600 --> 04:04.880
essentially the same memory footprint. It's, that's fantastic. It's the version

04:04.880 --> 04:08.040
of Firefox we've all been waiting for since Chrome was released.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.520
Well, so I, I don't know if I've been waiting. I don't know if I've been

04:12.520 --> 04:16.240
necessarily waiting for that, but it is nice to see Firefox starting to step up

04:16.240 --> 04:19.880
and compete on in some of the same ways that Chrome has been competitive because

04:19.880 --> 04:23.720
you know, as a person and I've bound, you have to, but we've both bounced back and

04:23.720 --> 04:26.880
forth between Chrome and Firefox. And for me, we kind of, we're opposite, right?

04:26.880 --> 04:29.440
I primarily stick to Firefox and every once in a while I try that Chrome thing

04:29.440 --> 04:32.960
out. In fact, I'm using Chrome today, but there are legitimately performance

04:32.960 --> 04:37.160
things that I notice anytime I'm using Chrome that just don't exist in Firefox.

04:37.760 --> 04:43.360
To me, it feels sturdier. It feels faster. It feels like the pages pop faster than

04:43.360 --> 04:47.360
Chrome. Um, I don't have all of my extensions yet, which has always, has

04:47.360 --> 04:51.080
always been my, sort of my, my problem, but I'm trying to just come up with

04:51.080 --> 04:54.040
other ways to do that stuff. It's pretty, it's pretty nice, Noah.

04:54.840 --> 04:58.600
Huh. Well, that is exciting. I, you know, I knew that today was national pickle

04:58.600 --> 05:03.560
day. I did not know that today was national quantum day for Firefox. But

05:03.880 --> 05:04.640
today I learned.

05:04.840 --> 05:10.640
In the show notes, I put a link to a blog post at hacks.mozilla.org and they

05:10.640 --> 05:15.080
talk about, um, everything. But the things that I like the most is they talk

05:15.080 --> 05:21.960
about laying the foundation for what they call coarse grained parallelism. And,

05:21.960 --> 05:28.280
um, it's, it feels like, uh, it feels like they, they looked at what Chrome's

05:28.280 --> 05:31.360
doing and they went, shit, we really have a problem here. We've got to really

05:31.360 --> 05:36.440
fundamentally fix this. And instead of pulling like a Microsoft approach where

05:36.440 --> 05:40.800
they just sort of like back port fixes to windows and windows just keeps getting

05:40.800 --> 05:46.160
a bigger and bigger beast that can do more stuff. They really did like a house

05:46.160 --> 05:51.920
cleaning here. They went through and they broke some stuff and they reinvented

05:51.920 --> 05:57.880
some stuff and they replaced some stuff and they redesigned the UI and they, and

05:57.880 --> 06:01.200
then they, and then very clever, very clever for the Mozilla project. They,

06:01.200 --> 06:05.760
they saved it all up for this big release, this big quantum release and they

06:05.760 --> 06:08.800
gave it a name and of course that's from the quantum engine. They gave it, they

06:08.800 --> 06:12.800
gave it this whole spin. It's been, we've been talking about it for months now and

06:12.800 --> 06:17.320
it all landed and by doing so it gave them time to test and refine the

06:17.320 --> 06:21.760
features. So they were ready for launch and it gave everyone a common target to

06:21.760 --> 06:26.480
look at for Firefox. Yeah. And it gives you a night and day experience. If, as

06:26.480 --> 06:30.120
long as you don't have any extensions that block the quantum engine, it really

06:30.120 --> 06:34.360
gives you a night and day experience. And it uses, at least on my machines, it

06:34.360 --> 06:38.160
uses less memory than Chrome. Okay. So here's, here's really the, here's really

06:38.160 --> 06:42.000
the bottom line question. Who out there, and I'm kind of looking at you guys

06:42.000 --> 06:46.440
mumble room, who out there is currently a Chrome user and is now as a result of,

06:46.440 --> 06:52.480
of this news considering switching back to Firefox? That would be me. Okay, tell

06:52.480 --> 06:56.440
me about it. Yeah. Tell me about it. Well, well, you know, if they claim to be faster,

06:56.440 --> 06:59.960
I really want to look at it and see if they claim to be, if they claim to be

06:59.960 --> 07:03.840
faster and they actually are, if they've got a new, they've got me switching back

07:03.840 --> 07:10.120
after probably several years. Yeah. So what does, what does Firefox offer you

07:10.120 --> 07:14.040
that you're, that you're willing to jump ship on, on a working platform? What does

07:14.040 --> 07:17.520
Firefox offer you that's above and beyond? Why is it that if both are doing

07:17.520 --> 07:20.720
the same thing, basically we're saying is Firefox has caught up. Why then are you

07:20.720 --> 07:25.200
going to jump off Chrome to come back to Firefox? Well, one thing I've noticed is

07:25.200 --> 07:30.120
that Chrome can get very laggy as it goes, because like if you have a ton of

07:30.120 --> 07:34.280
open tabs, it will actually bog down your processor because it is actually

07:34.280 --> 07:39.360
literally running each tab in a process. Chrome seems to be streamlining out into

07:39.360 --> 07:44.840
like shared processes per tab. See, you know what I'm saying? So if it is, if it

07:44.840 --> 07:48.400
truly is faster and more efficient on the memory, more efficient on the CPU,

07:48.400 --> 07:53.520
then that gives me more power to do other things like video editing or audio

07:53.520 --> 07:59.200
production, that kind of thing. Okay, that makes sense. Anyone else? I'm looking at

07:59.200 --> 08:04.520
partly. Okay. Who was it that spoke up? One of our friends across the pond? I

08:04.520 --> 08:09.080
think it's been me. Okay. Sort of a switching over from, I think when they

08:09.080 --> 08:14.840
went Firefox 56, which was the recent speed up, I've sort of been about, from

08:14.840 --> 08:19.040
Chrome going to about 5050 between Chrome and Firefox. Some of it is just

08:19.040 --> 08:23.920
partly to half de-Googlify stuff and give support back to Firefox as a

08:23.920 --> 08:28.160
competition against Google. Right, and that's my, that's my position on it too,

08:28.160 --> 08:32.760
is a large reason that a large portion of the reason that I put up with some of

08:32.760 --> 08:37.440
the things I put up with in Firefox is largely because I like the organization,

08:37.440 --> 08:40.560
I like what they do, I like what they stand for, I like their principles, and I

08:40.560 --> 08:46.160
want to support that. And I am willing to sacrifice a certain amount of features

08:46.160 --> 08:49.040
and a certain amount of usability, I guess, is what it really amounts to. I

08:49.040 --> 08:52.080
mean, that's the truth. I'm willing to sacrifice some of those things. You know

08:52.080 --> 08:57.320
that means that's bad. They cannot, that cannot factor in at all in their

08:57.320 --> 09:01.840
strategy. Not a single tiny itsy bit. If that's what they're relying on, then they're not

09:01.840 --> 09:05.960
going to get adoption. I agree from a business standpoint, however, I think that

09:05.960 --> 09:08.880
they have earned enough good, because there was a time before Chrome was ever

09:08.880 --> 09:13.520
even a thing, where the Mozilla, where Firefox was my retreat away from

09:13.520 --> 09:19.520
Internet Explorer, and they bought themselves so much, so much buy-in

09:19.520 --> 09:23.960
capital with that from me personally, and as I continue, you know, there's so many

09:23.960 --> 09:26.960
things that the Mozilla Corporation does, that all of their meetings are open

09:26.960 --> 09:29.840
meetings. Anyone can attend a Mozilla meeting. I think they have a phone

09:29.840 --> 09:32.320
number you can dial up, or they have an online web stream, and you can just

09:32.320 --> 09:36.640
listen to what they're talking about, their line of thinking, how

09:36.640 --> 09:40.280
they're thinking. I mean, they're a very transparent organization, as opposed to

09:40.280 --> 09:44.560
Google, which is very much not a transparent organization. And so today, if

09:44.560 --> 09:49.240
we're saying that, you know, as the as the as Firefox becomes a technically

09:49.240 --> 09:53.480
competitive product against Chrome, then I think they really start to hold their

09:53.480 --> 09:56.800
own to be able to say, look, now we have the technical features, plus we have all

09:56.800 --> 10:00.680
this really good community offering. Yeah. Well, not only that, Noah, but also it

10:00.680 --> 10:04.880
seems like if I'm in the enterprise, this is the horse I want to bet on if I'm

10:04.880 --> 10:08.760
building internal applications that are dependent on a browser. Chrome is very,

10:08.760 --> 10:12.240
is very, is, is, everything's built around Chrome now. Like, you look at all these

10:12.240 --> 10:16.520
electron apps, it's, they're really all built around Chrome and Chromium. But if I'm

10:16.520 --> 10:20.280
in the enterprise, and I'm looking at building applications around a browser, I

10:20.280 --> 10:24.160
would, at this point, I would be much more inclined to go with Mozilla's

10:24.160 --> 10:28.200
products simply because what the foundation's purpose is, don't you think?

10:28.200 --> 10:31.880
Like, you can try, you have a lot more trust, and just that they won't suddenly

10:31.880 --> 10:35.620
change what they're doing. You have access to this act or secret sauce if

10:35.620 --> 10:39.480
you need it. Yeah, exactly. So I'm not hearing much from from Rika. I know

10:39.480 --> 10:43.240
Rika, you're a really strong Chrome user, real strong proponent of Chrome. What do

10:43.240 --> 10:47.720
you think about this? I'm not gonna change. Okay, that's fair. There's no

10:47.720 --> 10:51.780
real reason for me to do so. I like Chrome and a lot of the extensions that

10:51.780 --> 10:55.000
I use on Chrome aren't available on Firefox. Yeah, I think there's a couple

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
people in that boat. I definitely heard some people just around the office chatting

10:59.000 --> 11:01.960
about it who I wouldn't say are that interested in browsers. I mean, they are

11:01.960 --> 11:05.640
technical people, but I was, I was kind of surprised. I will say for my own usage

11:05.640 --> 11:10.740
as well that I already use Firefox and Chrome, you know, I have a, I use Google

11:10.740 --> 11:14.920
apps, etc. But I think Firefox is gonna be even more of a part of my life, and

11:14.920 --> 11:17.720
there'll be some systems where I probably will just drop Chrome altogether.

11:17.720 --> 11:21.000
Yeah. Popeye, I don't know if you're willing to talk about this on the air,

11:21.000 --> 11:26.840
but you have a very interesting workflow that Firefox is not currently capable of

11:26.840 --> 11:30.920
mimicking. Is that something you'd be willing to talk about? Well, yeah. So I

11:30.920 --> 11:36.920
use Chrome all day every day, and I use lots and lots of separate profiles,

11:36.920 --> 11:41.240
separate users in Chrome. And I like the way that Chrome lets me click a button,

11:41.240 --> 11:46.560
switch to another user, and I'll have a completely separate browser window with

11:46.560 --> 11:51.360
multiple tabs. Everything's saved for that user, which has a separate Gmail

11:51.360 --> 11:56.840
account. Everything is completely separate cookies. And whilst Firefox, I am

11:56.840 --> 12:02.080
told, can do this. And every time I try this, there are various extensions and

12:02.080 --> 12:06.600
ways and command-line options that let you do this. It's never as smooth as it

12:06.600 --> 12:12.640
is in Chrome. And, and I, what I want is a browser which is my work window to the

12:12.640 --> 12:17.040
world, and a browser which is my personal window to the world, and then another 10

12:17.040 --> 12:22.480
for my other online personalities that I have. And Firefox just can't do that,

12:22.480 --> 12:28.400
and Chrome does. And what's funny is, you know, so aside from the puppet account

12:28.400 --> 12:32.480
thing, what's interesting about that is I think you are willing to push the

12:32.480 --> 12:36.520
envelope a lot further than the average user, even the average technical user is

12:36.520 --> 12:40.040
going to do. Because I can tell you, I'm a fairly technical person. There is no way

12:40.040 --> 12:43.920
in this earth I'm going to sit there and open up terminals to start launching my

12:43.920 --> 12:47.280
web browser just to get, you know, it's just not practical for me. And I think

12:47.280 --> 12:51.240
there's a lot of people, so I think if you aren't able to fit that into your

12:51.240 --> 12:55.360
your workflow, I think anyone else that has that similar, you know, concept of

12:55.360 --> 12:59.760
they want to have online personas, and I think a lot of people do, I think those

12:59.760 --> 13:06.440
people are hosed. At least, I think I'm just as lazy as the next guy. I want an

13:06.440 --> 13:12.280
easy way to separate one bunch of work from another set of work. On a

13:12.280 --> 13:15.560
Friday night when it's five o'clock, I want to be able to close an entire

13:15.560 --> 13:21.160
window and all of my work disappears. So I can say I don't have to

13:21.160 --> 13:26.560
worry about email notifications or tabs that have documents in that are related

13:26.560 --> 13:30.240
to my work. I can just forget those as soon as I close that tab. Now I realize

13:30.240 --> 13:35.080
I'm a bit of a special snowflake because my my work machine is my personal

13:35.080 --> 13:38.840
machine. Yeah, and I know that's not the same as use cases. Most people have a

13:38.840 --> 13:42.440
work machine and a personal machine. I would say that that landscape is

13:42.440 --> 13:46.600
changing. I would say that the vast, there's a lot of people that are working

13:46.600 --> 13:50.320
from home, and I think a lot of those people are going to wind up with some of

13:50.320 --> 13:53.240
the with some of the same challenges and desires that you have. And I'll tell you

13:53.240 --> 13:57.640
what's interesting about working from home, because I do it too. It

13:57.640 --> 14:02.240
becomes so important to be able to distinguish this is home and this I'm

14:02.240 --> 14:07.040
spending personal time and I am doing working time. And when you're

14:07.040 --> 14:11.120
working from home the best way to do that, if you can, is to have separate

14:11.120 --> 14:14.160
machines. But the problem with having separate machines is oftentimes they are

14:14.160 --> 14:18.080
expensive. And so one of the advents that has come along in the past couple years

14:18.080 --> 14:21.920
that has really opened us up to be able to play with things, especially those of

14:21.920 --> 14:25.240
us that that are doing things from home and are trying to do simultaneous

14:25.240 --> 14:28.800
different projects, is obviously the ARM architecture. And up until recently I

14:28.800 --> 14:32.880
have had this issue where I I'm deploying Red Hat all day long and I'm

14:32.880 --> 14:35.680
deploying CentOS all day long and all these servers and then I get home and I'm

14:35.680 --> 14:39.280
like, and this just happened just a couple months ago, we were testing an EMR

14:39.280 --> 14:42.960
for a clinic and they said can you set it up and just show us kind of how it

14:42.960 --> 14:45.480
worked. So sure, so I'm kind of setting everything up and kind of got

14:45.480 --> 14:48.600
everything set up on a Raspberry Pi because they're cheap and they work. The

14:48.600 --> 14:52.520
problem was when we went to actually put it into production, we had to end up

14:52.520 --> 14:57.680
exporting out all of these, you know, SQL templates stuff because I couldn't just

14:57.680 --> 15:01.360
move everything over because it was it was the ARM port of it. It wasn't the it

15:01.360 --> 15:05.280
wasn't it wasn't binarily compatible with the x86 processor that that they

15:05.280 --> 15:10.640
were going to use in production. And and so what Red Hat has announced today blew

15:10.640 --> 15:14.880
me away because it's going to in a large way change a lot of that. And this is

15:14.880 --> 15:20.000
from Red Hat themselves. Red Hat has announced Enterprise Linux for ARM. So

15:20.000 --> 15:23.400
the article goes on to say today marks a milestone for Red Hat Enterprise Linux

15:23.400 --> 15:27.080
with the addition of a new architecture on our list that fully supports

15:27.080 --> 15:31.920
platforms. Red Hat Enterprise Linux for ARM is a part of our multi-architect

15:31.920 --> 15:35.760
strategy, the culmination of a multi-year collaboration with upstream

15:35.760 --> 15:41.080
community and our silicon and hardware parties. And so the article goes on to

15:41.080 --> 15:45.600
talk about how Red Hat basically took this pragmatic approach to ARM servers.

15:45.600 --> 15:50.480
And I remember, and Chris and I were talking about this earlier today, Linus

15:50.480 --> 15:54.600
said that a couple years ago that one of the things that excited him about ARM

15:54.600 --> 15:59.600
was he believed it was a true competitor to Intel in a way that he hadn't seen

15:59.600 --> 16:03.800
since back in the old back in the old Mac days when they were on a different

16:03.800 --> 16:09.280
architecture all together. And and and now we have a true competitor to Intel.

16:09.280 --> 16:12.000
And at the time I was kind of skeptical of that. I was like are you kidding?

16:12.000 --> 16:16.040
Because the ARM like basically at the time was like the thing that was running

16:16.040 --> 16:20.040
inside of cell phones. This couldn't do anything serious. And then year after

16:20.040 --> 16:24.520
year I've watched these things literally double in power until just last year I

16:24.520 --> 16:28.600
think we were doing our for last we were doing our review of the latest Ubuntu

16:28.600 --> 16:32.560
Mate and lo and behold I was installing the same operating system on my

16:32.560 --> 16:37.200
Raspberry Pi for $35 Amazon Prime available that I was installing inside

16:37.200 --> 16:40.360
of my studio. And it's just it's just this mind warp that I just couldn't get

16:40.360 --> 16:43.840
over. And I know Chris you you as a person in the studio I mean how many

16:43.840 --> 16:45.920
different computers are you sitting in front of? You can put your hand on

16:45.920 --> 16:50.880
probably eight of them right now. You know the thing that I think you touched

16:50.880 --> 16:56.640
on there that really is just un it's just it's an impossible force for Intel

16:56.640 --> 17:02.120
to deal with is because ARM processors are in all of these routers and all of

17:02.120 --> 17:06.760
these little tiny devices and all of these lady tubes and obviously in all of

17:06.760 --> 17:11.240
these phones. Yeah they're lady tubes. No I know I just I think of something else

17:11.240 --> 17:14.480
until I figure out what we're talking about. This is my safe way of not

17:14.480 --> 17:17.160
triggering them because people they're listening to the podcast they get

17:17.160 --> 17:20.640
really frustrated when you trigger their lady tubes. So I just refer to it plus

17:20.640 --> 17:24.600
it's it can be the Google it could be the it could be the. There's all kinds of

17:24.600 --> 17:28.680
annoying people in tubes these days. And there's a lot of annoying lady tubes so

17:28.680 --> 17:33.640
in fact they're all kind of annoying in their own unique way. Oh yeah. And the

17:33.640 --> 17:37.400
thing is all of them have ARM processors every damn cell phone though that's

17:37.400 --> 17:41.600
really the thing right every cell phone has the ARM processor in it and this has

17:41.600 --> 17:46.200
caused a momentum of investment and year-over-year improvement in a

17:46.200 --> 17:52.520
platform that Intel and AMD just can't simply sustain on the x86 side they just

17:52.520 --> 17:56.160
can't compete with that. Now they're so far ahead that it hasn't really mattered

17:56.160 --> 18:02.080
but the thing about these ARM CPUs is damn if they don't work great together

18:02.080 --> 18:06.280
because you can write and use modern operating systems to sort of carve out a

18:06.280 --> 18:12.280
few of these cores and so you have companies like Cray and Qualicom that

18:12.280 --> 18:18.040
are launching 48 core systems oh boy 48 core ARM systems and they don't carve

18:18.040 --> 18:20.800
they don't they don't even I mean Noah you and I were chatting about this

18:20.800 --> 18:24.200
earlier they don't they don't really cost that much. No they start out at

18:24.200 --> 18:27.280
lowest price I found and this isn't for the 48 core I think this is 30

18:27.280 --> 18:31.280
something cores 20 something cores 30 something cores but they start at 900

18:31.280 --> 18:35.400
bucks and then for the 48 core version you're looking at like just under 2k but

18:35.400 --> 18:39.160
you know the core is 2k but if you compared that to what you would what you

18:39.160 --> 18:43.720
would pay for just just just a quad core Xeon you know that's that's half the

18:43.720 --> 18:46.440
price of what I pay for some of the servers that that we we have that have

18:46.440 --> 18:49.940
four cores in it so the the amount of computing power that you're getting per

18:49.940 --> 18:53.720
dollar and then you know we haven't even talked about the energy because the the

18:53.720 --> 18:57.880
power consumption of these ARM devices is just a fraction of what they are on

18:57.880 --> 19:04.040
Intel or you know or AMD and so and and then by then by proxy then or by

19:04.040 --> 19:08.960
translation the heat that is output by a lot of these ARM devices is a fraction

19:08.960 --> 19:13.200
that's a big thing and then the fans are quite easy right yeah it means well it

19:13.200 --> 19:17.800
means less cost for the data center to run cooling and while these per core I

19:17.800 --> 19:20.960
think beard is probably about to say this while these per core don't compete

19:20.960 --> 19:27.120
with an Intel or an AMD chip yet the thing is is you can you can build core

19:27.120 --> 19:34.400
specific jobs so you can slice off 20 or 24 or whatever the cores for this

19:34.400 --> 19:38.440
particular application that you've custom written for this job well I can

19:38.440 --> 19:43.120
also think of like any number of servers I run and or have that it's not like

19:43.120 --> 19:45.920
they're at their peak performance all the time a lot of times they're just

19:45.920 --> 19:48.720
sitting there and if you could just have a especially if maybe you're running

19:48.720 --> 19:51.800
some sort of maybe you're running a chat server something else that has a high

19:51.800 --> 19:54.720
degree of parallelism but doesn't actually do that much it's mostly just

19:54.720 --> 19:57.960
sending keepalives between the million clients connected to it these seem like

19:57.960 --> 20:02.280
great fits for anything like that yeah now can I just say all of this aside and

20:02.280 --> 20:07.400
and much congratulations to the Red Hat folks for getting full Red Hat

20:07.400 --> 20:11.440
enterprise support behind this platform which is I think a huge milestone for

20:11.440 --> 20:16.640
the industry in general I also part of me has to say welcome to the party by

20:16.640 --> 20:20.600
the way a lot of us have been here for quite a while now especially those that

20:20.600 --> 20:24.480
are Debian based or Ubuntu based and then you look at some projects like the

20:24.480 --> 20:30.440
canonical has that like specifically some of the like long-term investments

20:30.440 --> 20:35.300
that some projects have made into working on ARM platforms into into

20:35.300 --> 20:40.160
really solid upgrades on those platforms and delivering software it I mean it's

20:40.160 --> 20:43.280
good that they're here but I kind of wonder what took them so long at the

20:43.280 --> 20:47.560
same time if actually I wouldn't mind commenting on that actually yeah sure go

20:47.560 --> 20:53.440
ahead go ahead Christian yeah so so as you know Red Hat the business model of

20:53.440 --> 20:56.560
Reddit right is that you sell a as called the standards operating system

20:56.560 --> 21:02.240
that you traditionally have installed on x86 systems and I think for anyone who

21:02.240 --> 21:06.640
worked with ARM in the past right it's historically been you know highly

21:06.640 --> 21:12.040
custom platforms where you basically like you get some sort of Linux version

21:12.040 --> 21:16.320
from usually the hardware vendor and it's a lot of manual tweaking to get it

21:16.320 --> 21:19.200
to running and maintain it and then ship your device right with with this

21:19.200 --> 21:22.480
Linux version and and of course when you need to do an update it is usually a

21:22.480 --> 21:27.320
bit painful so so when Red Hat decided to enter this market one thing that we've

21:27.320 --> 21:29.960
spent a lot of time doing was actually working to ensure that there is a

21:29.960 --> 21:34.960
standardized platform we deploy towards so oh so so I mean like the fact that

21:34.960 --> 21:39.480
this ARM service will be using UEFI that's partially because we said you

21:39.480 --> 21:42.240
know we need a standard way to boot the systems you don't want to you don't deal

21:42.240 --> 21:45.680
with ten different bootloaders on ten different platforms Christian if it

21:45.680 --> 21:48.560
would it be an accurate to state would it be an accurate statement then to say

21:48.560 --> 21:52.200
that some of the delay was Red Hat dragging the industry towards some

21:52.200 --> 21:56.200
standards yeah I mean it was working with you know Linaro and the industry

21:56.200 --> 22:00.520
partners to say that okay you know we are happy to put Red Hat's name as an

22:00.520 --> 22:03.840
enterprise hardware software vendor behind this but we also need you to then step

22:03.840 --> 22:06.120
to the plate and say that hey we're going to have a standards platform that

22:06.120 --> 22:08.880
you can install a standard operating system on you don't need to have a

22:08.880 --> 22:14.120
bespoke operating system to install it because I mean Red Hat is not I mean

22:14.120 --> 22:17.440
I don't even say this but Red Hat doesn't really have an interest in going

22:17.440 --> 22:22.960
into you know the bespoke OS market you know that it's interesting because that

22:22.960 --> 22:27.120
seems to align with what my perception of Red Hat and a lot of times if I'm

22:27.120 --> 22:31.200
being honest is a lot of times what is what pushes Red Hat to the top of the

22:31.200 --> 22:35.720
list anytime I'm sitting in front of a university board you know or what have

22:35.720 --> 22:40.920
you is that if something is put out by Red Hat I know that it's mature

22:40.920 --> 22:45.000
technology and I know there's there's an argument to be had here about system D

22:45.000 --> 22:48.400
but but for the most part when when Red Hat put something forward here they're

22:48.400 --> 22:51.900
usually one of the later adopters they're not one of the you know the the

22:51.900 --> 22:56.240
cutting-edge pioneers at least not on Red Hat Enterprise so what you're

22:56.240 --> 22:59.600
describing seems to fit with what my perception has been and again that's

22:59.600 --> 23:03.280
just I'm just some guy talking about you know my experience but that's what I

23:03.280 --> 23:10.500
have seen mumble room who else in here is is interested in who would deploy Red

23:10.500 --> 23:14.480
Hat Enterprise an enterprise operating system on an ARM architecture what does

23:14.480 --> 23:17.440
this change anything for you or is this something that you say well like Chris

23:17.440 --> 23:20.440
said you know Debian's had it for a while canonical has had it for a while

23:20.440 --> 23:23.400
so this is it's really nothing new this really doesn't give us a tool we didn't

23:23.400 --> 23:30.240
have in the toolbox anyone the problem the problem is probably that people are

23:30.240 --> 23:36.120
not using ARM architecture on business level right now but that might change

23:36.120 --> 23:40.080
soon I think so I think I think it is going to change soon I don't think it's

23:40.080 --> 23:44.160
I mean everybody's been predicting this over and over again but you now have

23:44.160 --> 23:49.320
Cray you have Qualcomm I mean you have a lot of big players they're saying we're

23:49.320 --> 23:54.760
not replacing x86 but if you have an application specific task for us we're

23:54.760 --> 23:58.040
ready to go it also seems like it might lower that entry right because like well

23:58.040 --> 24:00.840
we weren't even considering it before but suddenly if we can run the same OS

24:00.840 --> 24:03.960
we can use very similar image versions from the people who maintain that no

24:03.960 --> 24:08.080
like we have a bunch of Raspberry Pi's that run TVs at my office right we

24:08.080 --> 24:11.120
already had that option if if we were a rel shop now that would that would be

24:11.120 --> 24:13.720
great right and so that that's actually what I was about to say was I

24:13.720 --> 24:18.280
respectfully disagree that that arm doesn't have a strong foothold and in a

24:18.280 --> 24:22.560
wide foothold inside of an enterprise audience I think where that where it

24:22.560 --> 24:28.960
best fits though is in a lot of you know appliance type applications but but but

24:28.960 --> 24:32.440
in that same way and kind of what you were touching on Wes is in that same way

24:32.440 --> 24:37.060
a lot of these a lot of these platform systems if you have software stacks and

24:37.060 --> 24:41.960
you have you know management systems for us that was really big our remote

24:41.960 --> 24:45.800
management system to log into systems and pull statistics and all of that when

24:45.800 --> 24:50.000
they came out with an arm port that was huge for us because we could then enroll

24:50.000 --> 24:53.680
all of those arm systems that we had even if they're just appliances into

24:53.680 --> 24:58.080
that central management system and so I would imagine that there are tons of

24:58.080 --> 25:00.380
businesses out there like you said they're either rel shops or they have

25:00.380 --> 25:03.880
custom software that runs on rel and they can say now we had these kind of

25:03.880 --> 25:06.800
one-off appliances that were out here that were on arm if we switched

25:06.800 --> 25:11.000
operating systems we could then have all of those standardized and I think that's

25:11.000 --> 25:14.240
hugely beneficial to businesses yeah I just want to know when I can build my

25:14.240 --> 25:20.360
arm PC you know as a longtime x86 user all I really care about is that I can

25:20.360 --> 25:23.480
build my own PC system because that's just cool and when I can start building

25:23.480 --> 25:27.560
my own arm systems then I'll care that's really for me that's it yeah and I think

25:27.560 --> 25:30.320
to us I mean if you're you know if you're happy with a raspberry pi you can

25:30.320 --> 25:34.760
do that today there also are there are more robust arm architectures out there

25:34.760 --> 25:38.040
in fact some of the I think some of the some of the best representation we have

25:38.040 --> 25:42.840
for that is from the arch arm group and those guys and I see them all the time

25:42.840 --> 25:47.040
at different Linux events and stuff and they have a whole table full of you know

25:47.040 --> 25:49.800
because we when I think of arm and when you think of our most people we think of

25:49.800 --> 25:53.240
these $35 raspberry pies but they have like four and five hundred dollar

25:53.240 --> 25:57.380
computers that are arm computers that you can install that are designed you

25:57.380 --> 25:59.760
know with with tighter tolerances because at the end of the day the

25:59.760 --> 26:03.280
raspberry pi was never designed to be a general purpose computer it was designed

26:03.280 --> 26:07.320
to be a teaching tool turns out it's such a great teaching tool and was built

26:07.320 --> 26:12.200
so well and designed so you know above what they targeted to do that you can

26:12.200 --> 26:17.080
use it as a general purpose computer and for 80% of people it works just fine but

26:17.080 --> 26:19.840
it does you know and I've tried to put it in some critical applications and

26:19.840 --> 26:23.760
I've gotten bit and so there are other devices out there and I wish I could

26:23.760 --> 26:28.120
tell you what they are I don't know I tell you what I do know Colonel 4.14 was

26:28.120 --> 26:33.160
released olinjiabuntu came out with an article today said Colonel 4.14 features

26:33.160 --> 26:36.880
a large number of new feature changes and is set to become the next long-term

26:36.880 --> 26:42.960
LTS release backed for several years by ongoing maintenance and support things

26:42.960 --> 26:46.080
that they have a whole list of things that they have added and those are in

26:46.080 --> 26:48.520
the show notes but things that stood out to me that I think are particularly

26:48.520 --> 26:52.480
interesting the Asus T100 touchpad support now if you don't know what the

26:52.480 --> 27:01.760
Asus T100 is it is a small laptop UMPC not quite UMPC more like like a netbook

27:01.760 --> 27:06.240
size PC they sell for about $150 to $200 you can pick them up at you know any

27:06.240 --> 27:10.080
Best Buy Target has them that kind of thing and it had the computer and the

27:10.080 --> 27:15.480
display is all in one so it's kind of a tablet style but the keyboard can be

27:15.480 --> 27:20.080
attached or maybe it flips around I'm not exactly sure but it is one of the

27:20.080 --> 27:25.400
most cost-effective well-built little netbook computers out there and Linux

27:25.400 --> 27:28.360
was originally very problematic on it when they when they first came out we

27:28.360 --> 27:31.360
tried to put Linux on one and we couldn't get Wi-Fi to work couldn't get

27:31.360 --> 27:34.560
Bluetooth to work the touchpad didn't work sound didn't work so basically you

27:34.560 --> 27:38.000
had a display and a keyboard and that was it and that was still such a good

27:38.000 --> 27:41.600
deal that I would run into people in fact I ran into somebody at Linuxcon I

27:41.600 --> 27:46.600
think last year and he had like this can just concoction of USB dongles to get

27:46.600 --> 27:51.600
all of the connectivity and devices working and with kernel 4.14 the last of

27:51.600 --> 27:55.200
those devices is now supported that's the touchpad so I thought that was

27:55.200 --> 28:00.400
pretty cool but yeah a better support for Ryzen processors if I can make a

28:00.400 --> 28:04.680
quick plug next week on the ask Noah show Monday 6 p.m. central we're going to

28:04.680 --> 28:09.280
have Wendell Wilson from level one Tex and Wendell is just he's a really great

28:09.280 --> 28:14.600
guy and he's been doing some really cool things with Ryzen and and threadripper

28:14.600 --> 28:19.160
doing PCI pass-through and and so that he can run Linux on his bare metal and

28:19.160 --> 28:23.580
but yet he can still take advantage of all of the software that Windows has to

28:23.580 --> 28:27.420
offer and he has some really interesting theories about how none of us are we're

28:27.420 --> 28:30.880
all going to be using Linux in just a couple of years I think I think he backs

28:30.880 --> 28:35.080
it up pretty well so make sure to tune in for that but but better Ryzen support

28:35.080 --> 28:40.020
for Linux means that that is all the more realistic yeah yeah I mean I as

28:40.020 --> 28:45.040
somebody who has almost exclusively either Intel or Nvidia hardware I got to

28:45.040 --> 28:50.700
admit it's looking really good for AMD GPU users these days but you know no I

28:50.700 --> 28:54.440
gotta say that I think the big thing about 4.4 don't say butter fs don't say

28:54.440 --> 28:58.500
butter fs nope no it's just the fact that is this is the new LTS kernel

28:58.500 --> 29:03.120
that's gonna be like six years and if if we start getting this in these here

29:03.120 --> 29:08.480
Android devices we might actually have ourselves like a sustainable patchable

29:08.480 --> 29:13.640
manageable Linux kernel that's used by millions of devices like this could be a

29:13.640 --> 29:17.840
really really good thing for Android let alone all the other distributions but

29:17.840 --> 29:22.520
just Android alone this could be a huge thing if if OEMs and and Google start

29:22.520 --> 29:25.160
shipping this kernel at some point absolutely

29:25.160 --> 29:27.760
mumble room what do you guys think who's super excited about the new kernel

29:27.760 --> 29:32.920
release oh well I mean there's butter fs

29:32.920 --> 29:36.600
produce back who comes in with the butter well yeah what are you super

29:36.600 --> 29:43.320
excited there you lie new compression support for butter fs everyone that's

29:43.320 --> 29:47.120
what that's what the feature set is just so that you can continue to they did

29:47.120 --> 29:51.820
also improve their SSD allocation algorithms and other which which I will

29:51.820 --> 29:54.720
say like we're all pretty down about butter fs especially for large storage

29:54.720 --> 29:59.200
but I think maybe OS volumes on SSDs is one of the places it does see some use

29:59.200 --> 30:03.440
yeah yeah I wouldn't put our fs on anything the no one that actually stood

30:03.440 --> 30:08.080
out to me is HDMI CC support for the Raspberry Pi no kid yeah yeah let's talk

30:08.080 --> 30:14.320
about which I believe is the thing that lets the Raspberry Pi yeah like here in

30:14.320 --> 30:19.720
the studio the Nvidia shield TV supports HDMI C so when you wake up the shield it

30:19.720 --> 30:23.280
automatically turns on the TV without you having to grab the TV remote so it

30:23.280 --> 30:27.760
kind of solves like the universal remote problem by just not needing it and my

30:27.760 --> 30:31.160
added support for more Raspberry Pis as well my understanding too and somebody

30:31.160 --> 30:35.080
correct me if I'm wrong on this but CEC allows you to not only just turn the

30:35.080 --> 30:40.200
device on but also acknowledge which is the active input so you can set CEC so

30:40.200 --> 30:44.360
if I have four different devices that are plugged into a TV when a device

30:44.360 --> 30:48.360
starts seeing activity it will switch the input to that particular device and

30:48.360 --> 30:53.040
power the TV on am I am I right about that yes yeah yeah it's great I mean it

30:53.040 --> 30:55.960
works here in the studio with the Android TV devices so it makes sense

30:55.960 --> 30:58.880
that you'd want this on a Raspberry Pi because you could put this on cody

30:58.880 --> 31:03.480
appliance work with previous kernels because I have auto arm here on a

31:03.480 --> 31:09.200
Raspberry Pi 3 and if I launch it my TV launches too yeah okay so there are two

31:09.200 --> 31:12.520
things there's HDMI CEC which is what Rick Rick I is talking about and that's

31:12.520 --> 31:16.200
where the Raspberry Pi is actually talking it's it's talking via data over

31:16.200 --> 31:22.960
the HDMI cable there is the box well so but just so we're clear a lot of TVs

31:22.960 --> 31:27.400
just support if there was an active HDMI signal just turn on the TV that's that's

31:27.400 --> 31:32.240
my bed my Western Digital TV which rest their soul they're great devices even

31:32.240 --> 31:36.200
though I'm not using them anymore those devices didn't support HDMI CEC but

31:36.200 --> 31:39.720
still when I powered the device on my TV would come on and that was just because

31:39.720 --> 31:44.240
the TV had a feature of if I see an HDMI signal just power myself up so there

31:44.240 --> 31:47.720
there is a different just because the TV came on doesn't necessarily mean it was

31:47.720 --> 31:52.720
doing CEC but it could have existed I have a Sony I have a Sony Bravia here

31:52.720 --> 31:59.080
so all I had to do I have to I had to install lip CEC now it's introduced in

31:59.080 --> 32:04.280
the kernel but I just had to add lip CEC install it and then it worked out of

32:04.280 --> 32:08.800
the box well okay all right if you had to add the live then it's not out of the

32:08.800 --> 32:17.800
box no no I don't don't feel bad we got to kill the term out of the box cuz

32:17.800 --> 32:21.720
when's the last time anybody installed Linux from a box give me a break we got

32:21.720 --> 32:27.400
to kill that yeah it's this giant nice big monolithic kernel I would buy one

32:27.400 --> 32:35.000
just for the novel have it on the shelf funny story guys Red Hat 7 shipped with

32:35.000 --> 32:39.880
a boxed version of Red Hat 7 yeah as a promotional item you could buy a boxed

32:39.880 --> 32:43.640
version of Red Hat 7 and they would deliver it in a box to your house you

32:43.640 --> 32:46.080
could open it up and they were like I don't know what they put inside I hope

32:46.080 --> 32:48.220
it was an optical disk because I wouldn't know what to do with it in a

32:48.220 --> 32:52.040
server these days we don't have optical drives anymore in storage somewhere I

32:52.040 --> 32:56.960
have a nice CD case with Red Hat Linux 5 yeah do you really yeah I collect

32:56.960 --> 33:02.880
versions of Red Hat I bought every single version of Soos and Mandrake that

33:02.880 --> 33:08.440
came out I got the free CDs from Ubuntu as long as I could I was all about it as

33:08.440 --> 33:12.760
long as I could because there's there was there was a celebratory fact or just

33:12.760 --> 33:16.840
like I have this I have this physical thing and one of the things I one of the

33:16.840 --> 33:23.120
things that made me use Soosa early on was this beautiful gorgeous detailed

33:23.120 --> 33:29.320
updated manual for every single release it was a book it wasn't a pamphlet Soosa

33:29.320 --> 33:33.920
had a book and I would read through that and I could feel the texture of the

33:33.920 --> 33:37.720
paper and it would have screenshots and it just it was so awesome that this

33:37.720 --> 33:42.560
Linux thing had this really physical book and I would still do I'd buy it for

33:42.560 --> 33:47.040
Ubuntu 1604 I'd do Solus I any you know I really would because not only is it a

33:47.040 --> 33:51.260
nice way to contribute but it's there's just but what I would want now is I'd

33:51.260 --> 33:56.560
want a branded USB Drive like like Martin there knows about a he seems to

33:56.560 --> 33:59.760
he seems to have found somebody who can make a very nice looking Ubuntu mate

33:59.760 --> 34:03.720
thumb drive maybe people should talk to to wimpy about that because damn that

34:03.720 --> 34:07.800
thing's hot looking it's a nice metal thumb drive and you could put that in

34:07.800 --> 34:12.160
like a packet with like a book or a pamphlet about it like oh I I'd spend

34:12.160 --> 34:16.480
$65 for something like that as long as like a good percentage of it went to the

34:16.480 --> 34:19.600
project you know that's yeah that's an that's interesting that might be a

34:19.600 --> 34:23.920
funding source or a funding revenue source for them you know I and I like I

34:23.920 --> 34:27.080
said I think redhead did it kind of as a promo thing so hopefully we don't find

34:27.080 --> 34:29.960
out if that actually worked out you know it's interesting so when you got that

34:29.960 --> 34:33.320
book did you go through and like read it like was there it was a reason in there

34:33.320 --> 34:38.920
I would say I skimmed it I skimmed it it was more about converting something that

34:38.920 --> 34:46.040
was this hobbyist crazy-ass nearly hippie ideal to a physical good that

34:46.040 --> 34:51.080
came in a box yeah like six discs and a book it was more about like that like

34:51.080 --> 34:55.120
reality of this thing that I had so I never had the soos but I had the

34:55.120 --> 34:58.240
redhat thing and the redhat I don't know if anyone out there remembers this but

34:58.240 --> 35:01.160
redhat used to come with a little pamphlet and it gave you like this

35:01.160 --> 35:04.520
quick start like this is Linux and it's a different operating system that you

35:04.520 --> 35:08.560
might not be familiar with and here's kind of the the basic how to kind of

35:08.560 --> 35:11.660
getting started thing and one of the things that you know the thing I guess

35:11.660 --> 35:15.000
that really kind of drew me to it was at when I sat down at Linux for the first

35:15.000 --> 35:18.240
time pulling these things out of the box I had no idea what I was doing and so

35:18.240 --> 35:21.880
every little tiny hint that I could get including those little pamphlets you

35:21.880 --> 35:24.840
know that was that was a big help to me of course today if I was doing that I

35:24.840 --> 35:29.060
would head over to Linux Academy slash unplugged because Linux Academy is going

35:29.060 --> 35:32.760
to do that same thing where you're going to have the ability to just visit a

35:32.760 --> 35:37.080
website and get a tutor that and these people these people care about Linux

35:37.080 --> 35:41.360
these people understand Linux they know Linux and you can tell if you've ever

35:41.360 --> 35:45.060
taken a bad online computer course a video course you can hear the

35:45.060 --> 35:48.360
instructor kind of like reading through his notes or they'll have bad takes or

35:48.360 --> 35:51.960
something and you can tell when you're sitting down and I did the the Red Hat

35:51.960 --> 35:56.440
7 one I think most recently rather than actually paying for the Red Hat course

35:56.440 --> 35:59.800
and I didn't find myself lost at all and I could tell as the instructor kind of

35:59.800 --> 36:03.280
went off on on little real hand stories well when I was working for this client

36:03.280 --> 36:06.840
or when I was doing this we found this to be most useful and this is why I'm

36:06.840 --> 36:10.080
super excited about this being in Red Hat 7 you can hear that personal

36:10.080 --> 36:13.440
commentary that's stuff that you just don't get with somebody who's just a

36:13.440 --> 36:18.880
paid voice to to read or or to to explain something right so Linux Academy

36:18.880 --> 36:21.760
slash unplugged they've worked out a really great discount for you so you can

36:21.760 --> 36:25.800
get started cheaper than ever and get started on your you know on your next

36:25.800 --> 36:29.680
Linux career we get emails all the time at both at the ass know a show and I'm

36:29.680 --> 36:33.640
sure you get them here on unplugged Chris but people are saying hey you

36:33.640 --> 36:37.840
started my career you jumpstart my career in fact is Eric still in the

36:37.840 --> 36:44.400
chat room with us Eric Eric H maybe not Eric I think I think it was smoking the

36:44.400 --> 36:47.720
crack pipe yeah maybe Eric H was he was telling me just the other day he was

36:47.720 --> 36:51.040
like you know what you and you and Jupiter broadcasting and thanks to

36:51.040 --> 36:55.400
companies like Linux Academy you got my new career started I started because of

36:55.400 --> 36:58.880
what you guys were we're doing on the network and for what things like your

36:58.880 --> 37:03.520
sponsors like like Linux Academy have done for me and it launched his in

37:03.520 --> 37:07.020
launches entire career and now he's on a completely different path and and I

37:07.020 --> 37:09.720
think that's just really great because we spend the majority of our lives are

37:09.720 --> 37:12.480
working here so you want to be doing something you love so head over to

37:12.480 --> 37:16.080
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and make sure to take advantage of that

37:16.080 --> 37:20.880
discount sorry going I was just gonna say you know the thing about Linux

37:20.880 --> 37:25.280
Academy to that I really love about it as a Linux geek is they they passed the

37:25.280 --> 37:28.960
sniff test because when you start using it you go oh yeah these guys are

37:28.960 --> 37:33.080
definitely they're geeks they love Linux and that's when you that's when it

37:33.080 --> 37:37.400
clicks that's when it clicks so apparently I'm talking about Linux

37:37.400 --> 37:40.760
Academy like it's something that everyone knows they have a website it's

37:40.760 --> 37:46.000
linuxlinuxacademy.com slash unplugged apparently there's there's a URL that

37:46.000 --> 37:48.840
you have to go to to actually get there oh then you get the free seven-day

37:48.840 --> 37:53.180
trial so that's that's useful yeah that's academy.com slash unplugged there

37:53.180 --> 37:58.440
you go all right so is it is it is it Chris or Rekai who oh no no no no I'm

37:58.440 --> 38:03.800
sorry I'm sorry I jumped ahead so one of a new software new software release yeah

38:03.800 --> 38:07.320
I know I know I know but I didn't I didn't see that until I scroll down a

38:07.320 --> 38:12.520
little bit new software version of OpenShot 2.4 is released and I tell you

38:12.520 --> 38:16.040
what I I played with it for just I didn't have a lot of time to play with

38:16.040 --> 38:19.400
it when I when I saw it I was I saw it just for researching the show and I

38:19.400 --> 38:22.440
downloaded it and I was just playing with it a little bit man are they making

38:22.440 --> 38:26.880
some progress OpenShot even if and I'll be the first one to admit even if

38:26.880 --> 38:31.160
OpenShot is not the video editor that I could use today to do the things that I

38:31.160 --> 38:35.760
need to get done even if that's not for me today OpenShot is definitely the

38:35.760 --> 38:40.920
nonlinear video editor on Linux that I want to succeed long term yeah I don't

38:40.920 --> 38:44.360
know if that makes sense you know no it does that's the nicest possible way to

38:44.360 --> 38:47.580
say it and I would like Jonathan to get a hold of me and I would like to have a

38:47.580 --> 38:50.560
conversation with him because I can honestly tell just by looking at the

38:50.560 --> 38:53.540
screenshots that this is never gonna work for Jupiter broadcasting this is

38:53.540 --> 38:57.560
never gonna work for me and you know if you look at the Linux gamecast I think

38:57.560 --> 39:00.960
there's a very specific reason that they're on a much older version of this

39:00.960 --> 39:05.400
program in this current one and I completely support somebody working

39:05.400 --> 39:09.320
their ass off on an open source project and I completely want somebody to build

39:09.320 --> 39:15.160
something for Linux that does this but Jesus if if it's not gonna be

39:15.160 --> 39:18.640
completely irrelevant by the time he gets anywhere where this thing is usable

39:18.640 --> 39:23.200
pipewire is now just a couple of years away to be completely feature complete

39:23.200 --> 39:27.560
and this thing's gonna have to be completely rewritten to use any of that

39:27.560 --> 39:32.040
and the UI is fundamentally impossible for anything that's more than just a

39:32.040 --> 39:35.400
couple of tracks of editing so which means if it's anybody that's trying to

39:35.400 --> 39:38.000
edit anything more than their Thanksgiving dinner it's never gonna

39:38.000 --> 39:41.880
work for anybody that was a really nice dinner yeah right that's all it's good

39:41.880 --> 39:46.280
for and I totally respect Jonathan I totally respect the OpenShot project I

39:46.280 --> 39:50.720
have used past versions of OpenShot which are really great this unfortunately

39:50.720 --> 39:55.480
is like skating to where the puck was about six years ago and I really I

39:55.480 --> 39:58.520
really am a disappointed to say that as somebody who actually backed this

39:58.520 --> 40:04.200
project when he did it on Kickstarter I was a backer of this I mean yeah I mean

40:04.200 --> 40:07.480
you have to be realistic you know I will say they have they have done some they

40:07.480 --> 40:11.480
have done some cool things improved playback one of the things that Linux

40:11.480 --> 40:16.120
has struggled with is both 4k and video that is above 30 frames per second so

40:16.120 --> 40:20.840
this has a smooth playback for 50 50 frames per second 60 frames per second

40:20.840 --> 40:24.840
and 120 frames per second so they are making progress and I'll tell you where

40:24.840 --> 40:30.160
OpenShot really fits in is if you just need to clip some video files up if you

40:30.160 --> 40:33.240
just need to drop a video file in and clip off the beginning clip off the end

40:33.240 --> 40:37.400
or you know make a clip mashup or something like that if you want a really

40:37.400 --> 40:42.880
easy simple video editor to do that I think OpenShot fits the bill there but I

40:42.880 --> 40:46.040
echo a hundred percent your sentiment I think when you start getting into any

40:46.040 --> 40:50.800
even remotely complicated workflow you're just you're gonna be struggling

40:50.800 --> 40:55.320
I mean Kdenlive is is is is a great fantastic open source editor that I

40:55.320 --> 40:59.080
think is light years ahead of open OpenShot I agree Kdenlive is a is a is a

40:59.080 --> 41:02.360
much better candidate for this particular type of work and then when

41:02.360 --> 41:05.640
you need to go beyond that Lightworks it's a bit of a learning curve but it

41:05.640 --> 41:09.760
is absolutely a capable editor and that's available for Linux as well and

41:09.760 --> 41:15.520
so it's getting you have you have go ahead yeah yeah yeah talk about that

41:15.520 --> 41:20.000
is it rotten are you using DaVinci resolve I have used it I don't use it

41:20.000 --> 41:23.600
typically because I don't like the way they distribute it but overall it's uh

41:23.600 --> 41:28.560
it's it's still it's definitely a good editor and I wish they would make a more

41:28.560 --> 41:33.880
reasonable distribution method well what are you using for tux digital Kdenlive

41:33.880 --> 41:37.380
basically okay always Kdenlive I use Lightworks occasionally too but it's

41:37.380 --> 41:41.920
almost always Kdenlive but I just wanted to say like I think OpenShot's more in

41:41.920 --> 41:46.760
the iMovie realm yeah I would agree I would agree it's it's one of those

41:46.760 --> 41:49.600
things that you can you can pick up and just throw something together real quick

41:49.600 --> 41:52.880
I'm curious what do you find egregious about the distribution for DaVinci

41:52.880 --> 42:00.560
resolve they have a it's a binary that you have to run a rooted sh file to

42:00.560 --> 42:07.040
install it so like it's not any kind of format of it's it's a it uses this thing

42:07.040 --> 42:14.920
called make sh and it's just like it's a weird binary compiled bash

42:14.920 --> 42:21.760
script essentially you can't see what the script is doing and you have to root

42:21.760 --> 42:25.680
give it root access as a script oh and then you and it's and it's so weird

42:25.680 --> 42:30.840
because you can't like unpackage it or anything so it's like if anything at

42:30.840 --> 42:35.560
least do an app image like do something that's reasonable yeah even OpenShot

42:35.560 --> 42:41.880
doesn't have image yeah yeah yeah well anyway I think part of that I think is

42:41.880 --> 42:45.440
there's a discussion to be had on you know how software manufacturers are

42:45.440 --> 42:49.080
supposed to target distributions because when they go to make an installable file

42:49.080 --> 42:52.000
it's like well which distribution are we installing for something I think

42:52.000 --> 42:55.120
there's a discussion to be had there and I think that snaps and flat pack and

42:55.120 --> 42:59.880
stuff are gonna go a long way to fix that so Chris tell me about this gnome

42:59.880 --> 43:05.760
show for proposal this is really interesting because it's it's gotten a

43:05.760 --> 43:10.280
lot of immediate reaction today on on the internet and some of the reaction

43:10.280 --> 43:15.000
has been are you kidding me you've just gotten gnome basically stable and now

43:15.000 --> 43:18.640
you want to reinvent the wheel with gnome 4 and then the other other end of

43:18.640 --> 43:21.820
the spectrum has been finally what the hell is taking you guys so long to

43:21.820 --> 43:25.280
address some of these fundamental issues so we have two links of the show notes

43:25.280 --> 43:28.880
ones to a pharaonic article that summarizes it really well and then one

43:28.880 --> 43:33.240
is to the actual wiki post by the gnome project that gives a lot of detail but

43:33.240 --> 43:38.120
essentially you have gnome 3 shell today which is doing great right everybody's

43:38.120 --> 43:43.760
loving it it's getting deployed in all the places but it's built around x11

43:43.760 --> 43:50.520
it's built around the era of x11 and with gnome shell for they want to build

43:50.520 --> 43:55.880
it around Wayland a Wayland first design as the project puts it and the whole

43:55.880 --> 44:02.320
idea is to do away with x11 slash X org support entirely their words not mine

44:02.320 --> 44:06.280
the new gnome shell would be better fitted for low latency input 40 and low

44:06.280 --> 44:10.680
latency visual input event feedback who doesn't love that and low latency zero

44:10.680 --> 44:13.880
copy client 40 those all sound good because they have the word low latency

44:13.880 --> 44:19.000
in front of them you hate latency I kind of like zero copy I don't know what that

44:19.000 --> 44:24.040
means but I like it it's good because it's like you can copy without having to

44:24.040 --> 44:27.120
copy on the back end of them for back to the client it's good Rekha it's good

44:27.120 --> 44:34.280
based on synergy yeah it is and that's so so that's the the Wayland first is

44:34.280 --> 44:38.000
what's getting the headlines but what I think is more interesting about this

44:38.000 --> 44:42.840
story and you you learn more when you read the actual wiki post is the gnome

44:42.840 --> 44:49.720
project is facing a couple of really really hard choices three I think to be

44:49.720 --> 44:54.680
exact and they identify they identify a few core problem areas the number one

44:54.680 --> 44:59.960
problem that need new solutions and man if I don't agree with every single one

44:59.960 --> 45:04.920
of these number one low latency input 14 is a problem that they need new

45:04.920 --> 45:08.720
solutions for number two low latency visual input event feedback like

45:08.720 --> 45:13.520
specifically to put that back in user terms they mean cursor movement feedback

45:13.520 --> 45:18.400
you move the cursor it should be glued exactly to your mouse movement exactly

45:18.400 --> 45:22.480
you you move that mouse a millimeter it should represent that exactly it should

45:22.480 --> 45:28.720
be glued together low latency and zero client copy forwarding also input methods

45:28.720 --> 45:33.320
in the shell and this is the number one thing that they put as number five on

45:33.320 --> 45:39.640
their list but for me this is number one stalls on the main thread and stalls on

45:39.640 --> 45:45.320
the compositor for frame redraws now that one line item is a really really

45:45.320 --> 45:49.960
big deal because it means breaking gnome up into a bunch of different processes

45:49.960 --> 45:55.160
where you don't just rely on one primary renderer which is what always ends up

45:55.160 --> 46:00.000
being the fundamental criticism of gnome now they have a few different potential

46:00.000 --> 46:05.040
solutions for this that they've outlined on their wiki and some of these are

46:05.040 --> 46:10.760
radical option a is pretty big and it's the closest to the I would say the

46:10.760 --> 46:16.000
plasma desktop setup it's a UI process and a compositor process which is

46:16.000 --> 46:21.560
exactly how the plasma desktop does it today there's also a few other like less

46:21.560 --> 46:24.760
dramatic options that they have available to them that they're

46:24.760 --> 46:29.600
considering another option potentially being less drastic but would only solve

46:29.600 --> 46:34.200
three out of the five problems I just listed is to introduce a proxy display

46:34.200 --> 46:40.080
server yeah proxy display server would be somewhat similar to an X server and

46:40.080 --> 46:45.080
then they would essentially have gnome talk to that and then that proxy would

46:45.080 --> 46:50.200
talk to Wayland you know kind of like Mir but let's not bring that up and then

46:50.200 --> 46:57.840
they have pros and cons outlined for all of that and what it left me with is this

46:57.840 --> 47:01.480
is what I was talking about earlier in the year on this show is the transition

47:01.480 --> 47:05.400
to Wayland and we've all been like let's get Wayland going let's get Wayland by

47:05.400 --> 47:09.280
default let's get Wayland working on Nvidia let's get Wayland working on

47:09.280 --> 47:14.520
Intel the thing is is once you get to Wayland there is so much more work for

47:14.520 --> 47:19.400
these desktop projects and they in some cases are gonna have to reinvent some of

47:19.400 --> 47:24.320
the core aspects of the desktop and in the case of gnome shell 4 it would

47:24.320 --> 47:29.760
break most likely and and the projects the one saying this not me gnome shell

47:29.760 --> 47:33.960
3 extensions so all the extensions that you are currently using to make your

47:33.960 --> 47:38.640
gnome 3 shell usable would likely break with gnome shell 4 now I'm not saying

47:38.640 --> 47:41.400
that's gonna be the end of the world I'm not saying there's not gonna be an easy

47:41.400 --> 47:45.840
transition or maybe a new standardized stable API out of this it could all it

47:45.840 --> 47:49.160
could end up in something much better

47:51.760 --> 47:55.680
yeah but but he could end up in something that's better than what we

47:55.680 --> 48:01.000
have now but in the immediate short term your doc your crazy hack to do XYZ could

48:01.000 --> 48:04.240
break you know for me be my Bitcoin widget I'm sure because they like to

48:04.240 --> 48:10.920
break that a lot and so gnome shell 4 is now on the horizon and it's it is just

48:10.920 --> 48:15.560
one of the millions of dominoes that are gonna fall in this transition to

48:15.560 --> 48:25.160
Wayland yeah I it so it's gonna be interesting to watch but I kind of

48:25.160 --> 48:29.520
resonate with what you were talking about earlier when you said why not why

48:29.520 --> 48:34.080
not start working with you know canonical and mere to do a lot of these

48:34.080 --> 48:40.800
things that they're trying to reinvent the wheel on well you know you know here's

48:40.800 --> 48:44.960
got a lot of a lot of you know we call this thing called drama I don't know if

48:44.960 --> 48:47.400
would you guys call it over in Grand Forks but here on the west coast we call

48:47.400 --> 48:50.600
it drama well here's and here's well here's the other drama if we're talking

48:50.600 --> 48:54.680
about drama then what kind of message does that send from the gnome community

48:54.680 --> 48:59.560
up to canonical would have basically just banked their business on this on

48:59.560 --> 49:03.600
this desktop I wouldn't say bank the business I'll say that at least the

49:03.600 --> 49:07.480
desktop part of it yeah yeah I don't know that's a good question

49:07.480 --> 49:11.120
they're desktops I don't they don't seem to actually have like they care about it

49:11.120 --> 49:14.800
but business-wise they don't care about it well I wouldn't say that I don't know

49:14.800 --> 49:18.120
about that I wouldn't the desktop art because you can say like this server

49:18.120 --> 49:22.120
implementation doesn't really matter if gnomes there or not the IOT stuff doesn't

49:22.120 --> 49:24.960
matter if gnomes there or not yeah but so here's the thing here's the thing

49:24.960 --> 49:31.560
rotten is if I'm Dell or I'm HP or I'm anybody that's gonna pre configure and

49:31.560 --> 49:37.400
ship a canonical derived desktop I feel better right now that they're using

49:37.400 --> 49:42.640
gnome because I look at business risk and I evaluate other companies and

49:42.640 --> 49:48.600
compared to me canonical is a small shop that is struggling to make it by and I'm

49:48.600 --> 49:52.200
super rich I'm worldwide I want to ship my products to millions of customers and

49:52.200 --> 49:55.840
I'm a little skeptical that they can pull all that shit off and so the fact

49:55.840 --> 49:59.440
that they're now deferring that work to the community that the wider community

49:59.440 --> 50:03.400
and a huge part of that development is backed by redhat and that's no secret to

50:03.400 --> 50:07.360
anybody anybody in the industry you know you look at these facts and you say well

50:07.360 --> 50:11.200
now we've just deferred our risk because now canonical is not solely responsible

50:11.200 --> 50:15.280
for the development of the Ubuntu desktop all of these companies are all

50:15.280 --> 50:19.040
in and they just have to do a great job of packaging up and make it work right

50:19.040 --> 50:22.480
and that's all I need to ship it on my hardware you know and that's that's the

50:22.480 --> 50:25.400
harder that's the hardware vendors perspective but then you have to look at

50:25.400 --> 50:29.160
the and this is not an insignificant amount of dollars not an insignificant

50:29.160 --> 50:31.720
amount of revenue and not an insignificant amount of the Ubuntu

50:31.720 --> 50:35.680
infrastructure look at companies like Amazon and Google and I'm not talking

50:35.680 --> 50:38.840
about Amazon servers I'm not talking about Google servers I'm talking about

50:38.840 --> 50:42.280
the workstations that sit in front of the human beings that use them those

50:42.280 --> 50:47.000
machines are running Ubuntu on the desktop Amazon has and I've talked to a

50:47.000 --> 50:49.680
number of different Amazon employees one of them is a good friend of mine he's

50:49.680 --> 50:54.400
been on you've been on this show and on ask Noah Sean and and he's one of the

50:54.400 --> 51:00.800
guys that works in the the IT department for Amazon and Ubuntu is by far the

51:00.800 --> 51:04.560
dominant operating system desktop dominant operating system on their

51:04.560 --> 51:08.080
computers and very much the same thing if you talk to a Google employee they

51:08.080 --> 51:10.640
have a lot of Chromebooks they have some people what using MacBooks and really

51:10.640 --> 51:13.440
the common denominator for Google obviously is going to be Chrome and

51:13.440 --> 51:17.480
they've tooled Chrome to do all the things they need it to do but the actual

51:17.480 --> 51:20.680
workstation that does the calculations the actual thing that they're remoted

51:20.680 --> 51:25.240
into the actual thing that's doing the thinking that's a Linux Ubuntu desktop

51:25.240 --> 51:28.360
I'll give a brief you know because I've talked about it a lot recently on the

51:28.360 --> 51:33.740
show here but for us I was looking at different options for the studio because

51:33.740 --> 51:38.360
we were having a different array of technical problems that essentially came

51:38.360 --> 51:41.760
down to running multiple Linux distributions I mean not to not to make

51:41.760 --> 51:44.800
but that's what it kind of came down yeah yeah and so we if we just

51:44.800 --> 51:49.600
standardized on one thing and I emphasize that by hitting my mic if we

51:49.600 --> 51:55.120
just standardized on one thing then we would kind of like have one common thing

51:55.120 --> 51:58.600
to work towards and so after after a bunch of testing which I've talked about

51:58.600 --> 52:04.840
a ton on the show we landed on Ubuntu 1604 for the production OS yep now the

52:04.840 --> 52:08.920
reason one of the things that did factor into that is there isn't multiple

52:08.920 --> 52:15.200
versions for me to figure out there's one Ubuntu LTS that gets five years I

52:15.200 --> 52:20.080
don't I don't have to go get like a CentOS version of Ubuntu right or like

52:20.080 --> 52:25.240
some sort of rolling version that's supported by a open source subset of a

52:25.240 --> 52:31.300
corporate backed it's just it's Ubuntu LTS and then later on after I get it all

52:31.300 --> 52:34.320
set up and I go oh guess what this shits actually working for me and it hasn't

52:34.320 --> 52:40.220
cost me anything I can I can then go choose to subscribe to landscape or some

52:40.220 --> 52:43.200
other some one of their other subscription services which then all of

52:43.200 --> 52:47.040
a sudden turns them into legitimate systems yep that I'm centralized managed

52:47.040 --> 52:50.160
and I don't have to like play this mental game that feels like it's from

52:50.160 --> 52:55.100
the 90s deciding which version of Linux I need do I need the Red Hat corporate

52:55.100 --> 52:59.320
version where I subscribe to their service do I need CentOS which is kind

52:59.320 --> 53:04.080
of like the same thing but I support it myself do I want tumbleweed do I want

53:04.080 --> 53:09.480
leap none of this crazy stupid abstracted different versions I get

53:09.480 --> 53:15.600
Ubuntu 1604 full stop it's Ubuntu 1604 it's the same one you can download for

53:15.600 --> 53:18.680
free it's the same one I can download for free it's the same one I can put on

53:18.680 --> 53:22.920
my personal laptop is the same one I can put up on a server on a VPS it is the

53:22.920 --> 53:26.880
same Ubuntu and the systems that are important to me I subscribe to landscape

53:26.880 --> 53:30.400
and I get a bun to advantage and now all of a sudden they're enterprise systems

53:30.400 --> 53:38.280
and to me that simplicity that felt like it was more kind of like like a basic

53:38.280 --> 53:42.880
straight approach was what was the eventual like okay well you combine the

53:42.880 --> 53:46.480
commercial support you buy it you combine the software support and you

53:46.480 --> 53:51.360
combine the selective commercial software like back support by canonical

53:51.360 --> 53:56.360
where I need it and it's great because I can have we can standardize 16 systems

53:56.360 --> 54:01.920
in the studio on 1604 and I can subscribe for support on six of them

54:01.920 --> 54:07.720
yeah absolutely and I you know the other thing is you are you are very involved

54:07.720 --> 54:11.960
in the community so probably not much comes as a surprise to you but there's

54:11.960 --> 54:16.360
there are a lot of companies that they just kind of they kind of just you know

54:16.360 --> 54:21.480
ad hoc trust that they want a company to to do the thinking for them and do all

54:21.480 --> 54:24.800
the planning and they deal with all the community minutia and just deliver them

54:24.800 --> 54:28.480
a product and that is a valuable service and that is also a valuable selling

54:28.480 --> 54:31.800
point when I'm going to talk to people about you know switching to Linux

54:31.800 --> 54:36.560
basically sure sure I bet it is and and when I was when I was working with a

54:36.560 --> 54:43.400
company where we were deploying lots of really critical Linux servers it was it

54:43.400 --> 54:47.760
was it was no question to buy the $5,000 red hat enterprise support I can't

54:47.760 --> 54:50.800
remember what we called it back then but they had multiple grades I don't know if

54:50.800 --> 54:54.800
they still do this and one was like you got like ten years and you got like a

54:54.800 --> 54:58.360
hotline to call support and that was what we bought we bought that really

54:58.360 --> 55:02.120
yeah yeah you know I'm talking about yeah and that wasn't even a big deal

55:02.120 --> 55:05.440
like whatever that's fine that's just it was just included as part of the

55:05.440 --> 55:11.000
purchase cost of a server and so you spend $15,000 and about 3500 of that was

55:11.000 --> 55:15.200
the server license and support and it was there wasn't even a conversation it

55:15.200 --> 55:19.480
wasn't a debate it wasn't looking at the merits of it it was you buy Red Hat and

55:19.480 --> 55:23.520
it's fine but now when I'm running my own business my own small business it's

55:23.520 --> 55:27.040
a completely different perspective I have on it and so I think that's why Red

55:27.040 --> 55:31.240
Hat can make billions of dollars still with this particular setup they have and

55:31.240 --> 55:36.000
it doesn't and and canonical can make a profitable revenue source with their

55:36.000 --> 55:40.080
setup because they're they're essentially appealing to a bit of the

55:40.080 --> 55:46.200
same market while at the same time super fulfilling different ends of the spectrum

55:46.200 --> 55:50.920
absolutely anyone if for the mumble room have any perspective to add before we

55:50.920 --> 55:58.920
move on actually I did so in regards to the whole gnome for thing you know with

55:58.920 --> 56:04.200
them the question should be is are they deprecating or are they reinventing

56:04.200 --> 56:08.520
because this sounds like a process that they've been working on for years it

56:08.520 --> 56:13.640
sounds like and have been building up to it just sounds to me like that the media

56:13.640 --> 56:21.080
is just freaking out in the same way that with pop OS and calling it a fork

56:21.080 --> 56:24.800
when they're just changing the theme around no they're okay one pop OS is a

56:24.800 --> 56:32.960
fork system 76 said it is to the the gnome thing it has been in process for a

56:32.960 --> 56:39.840
while yes but it they also said that it would know gtk4 and gnome 4 would break

56:39.840 --> 56:45.560
all compatibility gta3 that's why gta3 is going to have a very very long LTS yep

56:45.560 --> 56:49.520
and you know you also have to figure that there's more and more LTS distros

56:49.520 --> 56:54.000
these days shipping it yeah so they're gonna have like they're not deprecate

56:54.000 --> 56:58.080
yes they are deprecating it but they're going to wait a very long time before

56:58.080 --> 57:03.440
they deprecated it yeah yeah you should double down on your point to they have

57:03.440 --> 57:08.040
been they have been forecasting this for a very long time it's not like this is a

57:08.040 --> 57:11.080
surprise this is something that they've been talking about for a long time

57:11.080 --> 57:16.120
version 4 is called version 4 because it's meant to warn developers there's

57:16.120 --> 57:20.960
gonna be some breakage here yeah they said that about I think three years ago

57:20.960 --> 57:24.960
they started saying that this will have breaks and to chime in a bit here I've

57:24.960 --> 57:29.720
been at the wikipost was written by Jonas Odal who's on my team and who's

57:29.720 --> 57:35.080
been on the main guys behind a lot of our port work to to Wayland so I mean at

57:35.080 --> 57:39.800
the moment no code is written here this is basically him saying okay you know I

57:39.800 --> 57:43.640
spend a lot of time helping off with the port of gnome 3 to Wayland and we still

57:43.640 --> 57:47.400
have things we plan to do there but here's some of the problems I see and I

57:47.400 --> 57:51.000
think here's maybe how we want to look at resolving them in the long run so I

57:51.000 --> 57:55.680
mean my recommendation to anyone be that not don't hold your breath for gnome

57:55.680 --> 58:05.320
shell 4 it's sort of multi-year thing so Chris tell me about James Nugent yeah

58:05.320 --> 58:09.560
so this is a friend of the show a podcast they've put out over at advanced

58:09.560 --> 58:15.320
tech media org and they just did an interview with James Nugent and James is

58:15.320 --> 58:19.600
an interesting interesting fellow he's across the pond over and I I'm gonna I'm

58:19.600 --> 58:23.680
gonna try to I'm gonna give an attempt I feel like I can get this one bath

58:23.680 --> 58:35.640
England yeah he works at joinette which we talk about about on this network

58:35.640 --> 58:39.840
especially the text net program and in BSD now they were recently acquired by

58:39.840 --> 58:42.880
Samsung Electronics and they still are super active in the open source

58:42.880 --> 58:48.960
community and he's a core contributor at hashicorp and event store and he also

58:48.960 --> 58:53.320
produces the open source stream database with a built projections system I don't

58:53.320 --> 58:57.520
know what that means but I would almost listen just to find out you almost got

58:57.520 --> 59:01.640
it Chris it's actually joint oh I know I know I always get it wrong I've always

59:01.640 --> 59:05.520
gotten on joint you're right you're someday so joinette joint this looks

59:05.520 --> 59:10.160
like a great podcast oh man yeah yeah that's the interview fans tech media org

59:10.160 --> 59:17.280
and it's put on by Alexandra and Adam and they both came to our barbecue meetup

59:17.280 --> 59:20.040
that we had a little bit ago so I thought we should give them a plug so I

59:20.040 --> 59:23.240
know what I'll be doing after the show plug skis we'll have a link for that or

59:23.240 --> 59:27.360
you can just go to advanced media org it's episode 9 with James and he's all

59:27.360 --> 59:30.680
in with joint or joinette however you want to say it I don't judge I don't

59:30.680 --> 59:36.080
judge where those things the guys that in the sous vide yeah well I yeah yeah

59:36.080 --> 59:40.320
yeah they were and I don't know I don't know I don't know if we got actually a

59:40.320 --> 59:43.580
chance to eat it during the barbecue because it would took so long that's the

59:43.580 --> 59:48.320
problem with the soup yeah they did give the go and they brought the whole unit

59:48.320 --> 59:52.640
with the cooler and all that so it was me and Adam yeah yeah yeah that's right

59:52.640 --> 59:56.040
bachelor fruit was here too of course Dustin was yeah yeah yeah Adam and I

59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.400
just came down together I love it I love it so their podcast is at advanced media

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:05.760
org check it out advanced tech media org check it out for episode 9 you know what

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.560
I would totally recommend to them if they if they're if they're not doing

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:12.240
this already is they should check out tune in because tune in is it's a it's a

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:16.800
really cool service and what they do is they allow you to basically you can you

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.800
can use their infrastructure to have a mobile app that people can listen to

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.320
your show or they can listen to a web browser they can listen to it on the

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.600
Alexa all of that kind of stuff there's a really cool tool that I really like

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.080
it's called easy stream it's a command line based streaming utility that you

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:34.780
can use to send an ice cast either a file or an ice cast stream out to a

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.800
service you can just take you know a given mp3 and you could put it on a

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.880
loop people could go to that tune in site and they could and they could

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.900
listen to it to your show and crazy well here's the thing the problem is when

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.200
you're first setting this stuff up there's like this config file you have

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.960
to write and I'll throw the config in the show notes for anyone that wants to

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.880
play with it but let me tell you the first time here's what it is it's you

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.720
install the operating system you set up the software and then you try and see if

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.080
it works and then you're not quite sure well maybe this thing is wrong or maybe

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.520
that file is wrong or maybe I put this in the wrong location I'll just better

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.040
start over and then you blow it away and then you start all over again you know

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:11.000
what the easiest way to do that is with something like digital ocean digital

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.080
ocean is Linux on demand it's like Linux on tap actually that's what you could

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.400
call it and basically I can get a Linux server anytime I want it just by going

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:24.680
to digital ocean comm I have I'd say probably I'd say I think at this point

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:29.520
all but two of my servers on digital ocean are on the $5 droplets all of them

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.400
are on the $5 you know the $5 droplets just get you everything you need of

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.280
course they can go up to $10 droplets $15 droplets $20 droplets but it gets

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:42.440
even better because if you use the code do unplugged then you get free droplets

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.240
at least the $5 ones you get those for free for two months so if they so these

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.640
guys they want to do a streaming service so they want to set this up and have a

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.560
mobile app they could use easy stream they could go over to digital ocean use

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:57.480
that code do unplugged and they'd have a mobile infrastructure for free for the

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.400
first two months and after that's only five bucks so how you getting better

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:05.600
than that digital ocean comm make sure to use the code d o unplugged dashboard

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.960
for dashboard you and your dashboard I don't you know we've never said the word

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.840
dashboard on the ask no show I don't think oh no you are doing your viewers a

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.840
disservice my friend is a good dash an amazing dashboard you know why you know

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.880
I know what you better be talking about the API oh that's right yeah you say

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:28.360
that all the time yeah oh no okay that yeah no you don't but finish you should

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.640
finish your thought though why is it that you always talk about the dashboard

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:36.920
I lived in servitude to really really really really really really really

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:42.600
really really hold on really really bad virtualization you eyes and I and I and

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.320
sometimes like the whole infrastructure all of it would run on on Linux and then

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.640
I would have to have a Windows machine to manage it and it would drive me so

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:58.920
crazy works in Internet Explorer yeah oh oh it's active active active X yes

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:04.240
Internet Explorer 5 or 6 maybe oh and I suffered through a lot of that in my day

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.600
and so now to go to to go to digital ocean and have all of it work in

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:10.720
whichever browser you want to use on Linux but it more importantly to have it

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.960
be better than anything I used and some of those things you know they cost 200

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.520
300 thousand dollars three hundred four hundred thousand dollars maybe actually

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.520
be expended there why wasn't me it was the businesses that were buying it and

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.040
it was and you ended up with these total crap you eyes well not only that but it

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.720
shows that they have total trust in their API because the dashboard is

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:31.880
sitting on top of the API yeah yeah it's pretty great it's pretty great that's

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.520
all that's why you know what I thought you know what I thought you were gonna

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:38.680
say I thought you were gonna say well I say dashboard because a bunch of people

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:42.080
who got all upset that I said the word dashboard like twice and so then they

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.400
went on this like they went on this like rampage to like Twitter and read it

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.800
right all this other stuff I'll just say that's why I say it now yeah I mean

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.240
that's why I say it for now that now that's why I say yes okay so so

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.720
interestingly enough in the show in this show that I'm I'm guesting with you guys

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:03.040
I'm not the one that puts the new fedora 27 workstation features in the doc I

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.320
feel very ashamed about they're ahead of the curve over here you see Noah that's

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.520
because you're not running fedora because you you hate the the dis turn

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.880
out you're such an Ubuntu apologizer it's embarrassing for us it took us

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:23.520
hardcore redhat users here at jb1 to get this straight and oh sorry yes right

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.000
right hardcore redhat users yes you know we're back to the good old days we're

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.280
back to the good old days of Linux where fedora and Ubuntu kind of have the same

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:37.000
features but Ubuntu ships a month early and

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:45.680
you remember how it used to be like that because it's known again and a lot of

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.640
the progress comes from known because that's where the fedora project invests

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:53.320
a lot of its time and so I joke but at the same time a huge part of fedora 27

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:58.880
is it's everything you love about fedora with gnome 3.26 but one of the things

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:03.240
for me as somebody who likes to just follow all of this is this was really

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:07.840
the release that marked the end of the alphas and there's something else that I

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:13.760
just anecdotally noticed that I got to give them credit for not only did they

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:21.240
kill the alphas with this release cycle but I more than I have ever seen in in

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:25.760
well I I have actually I have followed the fedora project since it was the

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:30.960
fedora project I you know so I mean literally since I've ever seen this

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.480
distribution I have never seen more people anecdotally say across different

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:39.760
places that I monitor that this has been the most stable most reliable beta that

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:44.320
they have ever used of the fedora project and so not only did they end the

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:49.480
alpha sort of release cycle but they definitely upped their game on the

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.360
stability of the beta because just anecdotally I mean this is just my

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.160
observation monitoring a lot of different sources having followed this

01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:02.920
project since it was just a glimmer in somebody's eye this seems to be the most

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:09.680
stable release they've ever had now I will say selfishly what I really like

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:14.200
about fedora 27 is this is the release that really lays the groundwork for

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:20.080
pipewire which is the new media oh boy yeah oh boy yeah we're excited about

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.080
that here at Jupiter broadcasting because this is something that we think

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.960
Linux really needs to be competitive with macOS on the video editing side

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.280
and it was something just a year or two ago I thought would never happen and so

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.080
the fact that the fedora project is taking this on they will they will for

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.240
the rest of my life have my respect taking it seriously I mean they

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:42.860
recognize that this is something Linux community me mm-hmm yeah and and it has

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:47.080
been it has been something that I thought would never come to bear because

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:51.440
it seemed like it took it would take like this huge multi project multi

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.440
distro cooperation but I think pipewire the way they're doing it is it's humble

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:01.080
it's a it's a good steady slow approach so in fedora 27 it's it's nothing major

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:05.120
it's just gonna handle screen sharing and screen capture under gnome shell

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.160
it's like laying the fundamental groundwork and of course it's it's the

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.760
groundwork to support these functions under Wayland which couldn't couldn't be

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.840
done before so I really like the way they're their way the way they're

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:22.560
approaching pipewire the KDE version of fedora hasn't seen a lot they've switched

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.560
to five dot nine one for cute five and there's a few other things but Christian

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:31.880
is joining us he's there we he is very dutifully filling in at the very last

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.920
moment to join us from the fedora project to talk about some of the new

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:40.000
features so Christian welcome to Linux unplugged and I know I've mentioned a

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.280
couple of features but I bet I missed some feature fedora 27 that is deserved

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:49.920
of mention yeah thanks for having me yeah I think you mentioned some of the

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.440
important things and I mean I think what I mean you were talking about that you

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.560
know we are a month late but on the other hand we spent that last month

01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:00.200
fixing a lot of last minute bugs in home so hopefully it's a bit more stable to

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.920
rinse us under a lot of multi-month ratios that we were hammering to the last

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.360
minute yeah sorted yeah I mean the one of the things that really stood out me

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:14.440
when we installed fedora 27 is it is a straight-up showcase for gnome for like

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:18.680
upstream known and it's the the background is gorgeous and the

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.480
transparent the transparent bar up top that it's just it's it's a beautiful

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:29.240
default theme for fedora it's a great showcase for stock no thank you I mean I

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:33.800
think one of the features I would love to highlight a bit which is almost sort

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.760
on the side is is that this is also first release really where we where we

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:42.680
have fleet commander available which is our new tool for administrating a large

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:47.320
number of desktops okay so fleet commander so is fleet

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:51.400
command you haven't played with fleet commander no I play is it like is it

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.520
related to cockpit or is it a separate thing it's it's an extension of cockpit

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.280
so when when you have cockpit stolen and fleet commander you will actually see a

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:03.040
link where you can click into fleet commander from cockpit so it's but of

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.840
course my cockpit of course was written and it's mainly targeted doing server

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:10.320
administration a fleet commander is all about you know administrating desktops

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:17.520
oh nice and I'm in the background for fleet commander actually was we had a

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.080
discussion a couple years ago in how service saying that you know if you ever

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.840
want to see for instance Linux making a headway in corporate settings against

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:28.440
Windows we need to come up with something that's a bit more accessible

01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:32.440
to people than you know telling them to you know rewrite scripts figure out how

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:36.080
different command and tools work on Linux to configure stuff and instead

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.440
have something that's all graphical and and you know won't click deploy and it

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:44.320
integrates with the people's director services you know Christian I have to be

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:49.440
honest if this this is this is the dichotomy I have with the damn fedora

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:53.440
project right here you guys have cockpit you have fleet commander you have atomic

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:57.640
you have fedora cloud you have all of these things that would make fedora so

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:02.520
frickin perfect for deploying in production except for that fact that the

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:08.560
fedora releases are only supported for a few months like this is the dichotomy I

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:14.000
just can't get over yeah but maybe what they've done there I mean I mean you're

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.360
not the first person of course who complain about that but I mean for me

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:20.120
fedora is it's definitely like you know the distro we're targeting towards an

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:24.000
old enthusiast users developers and people who want to you know get the

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.280
news right away straight off the press yeah and at the same point of course I

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.400
know people were not so happy by use with CentOS or well because I felt it

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.440
was like okay it's fine real new rel out but then as the years go by you know a

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:42.880
becomes a bit long in the tooth for a desktop user so what we did switch for

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.280
in rel 7 is this model where we actually updating the desktop in rel and CentOS

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:52.400
of course as a result of that every second release okay so so that way you

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:57.360
get a refresh desktop experience continuously and so so that's also what

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.800
I'm telling people and I said hey I want a more long-term thing I said like well

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:04.160
you know I know that historically things like CentOS might not have appeal to you

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:07.920
or getting a rel subscription just because you didn't want to be there at

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:12.240
you know the dot six release and feel that you were using you know the desktop

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.160
yeah from ten years ago but that that's no longer true with well now you're

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.200
getting a brand new desktop every second release and every old release we're

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:25.360
updating a lot of the major applications there okay and I think as we go forward

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:31.320
and this so it's called a strategy we'll we'll call it coming to folks a bit more

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:35.040
because I mean one of the big goals I I hope that we will achieve it with things

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.400
like flat packs is that you suddenly can create like you know an application

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:43.400
stream that's independent of both fedora and rel so that you no longer have this

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.760
sort of tight link between like you know which application version you have and

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.800
which desktop version you had sure you just have you know hey I want to let

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.720
this gimp and I can deploy it either in fedora or on rel or of course or else

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.980
good point that's a that's a that's a really good point is the this may be a

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:04.720
non-issue once that's once that's in the pipeline so I have so many things to

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.880
ask you about and I don't know which which you'd rather answer so I'll give

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.200
you I'm gonna throw two at you actually how about three Christian I'm gonna give

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.400
you three questions and whichever one you feel more comfortable answering you

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:21.860
go for number one is what are your thoughts on on gnomes position about the

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:27.120
system tray icons to quote the fedora project workstation release notes the

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.480
quote-unquote antiquated system tray has been removed to reduce visual clutter

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:35.760
so that's question one is what are your thoughts on that question two if you'd

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.880
rather answer this is some big changes in fedora atomic including the support

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:45.520
for kubernetes have been introduced which seems like a huge huge was one of

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.680
the things I was most excited about like a huge change there and then also some

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.280
badass support for trim support on encrypted disks I know that's three

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.480
totally different topics Christian but since you haven't you know you know I

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.640
just thought I'd toss you those three and you pick which one's the best for

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:04.960
you to answer I think the last one is sort of old summer scope I mean just to

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.480
give you a little background on who I am and I'm actually the senior manager for

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:15.840
desktop graphics I 18n and fedora inside reddit all right great to meet you then

01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:22.720
so of course so even though of course the fedora team that I manage are in

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.720
charge of all the fedora editions of course due to all the other groups being

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:30.120
distributed that's sort of usually where my focus and it's being so so I don't

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:34.400
necessarily have a lot of insight into call it these other parts of of fedora

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.000
and so I'm also interested in just your opinions too so you don't you don't feel

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.440
like when you come on the show you have to have like I'm speaking on behalf of

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:46.640
the fedora project I'm just interested in your opinion as a Linux user too yeah

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:52.720
yeah I mean it's a talk to take the system tray I mean I think it was

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.840
something that was single for a long time that they wanted to stop having

01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:00.140
people use these data cycles because a they were using an old an old extender

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:05.940
that was problematic in terms of focus and many other things yeah and so they

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:09.280
tried to do this thing where I you know we sent up an awesome saying hey you

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:13.880
know eventually this will be deprecated and of course nobody ever moved on those

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:18.920
yeah but do you think but what makes you think anybody will move now well the

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.800
hope is of course that once it's not a default feature that you have to know

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:25.920
install extension if you want the system tray it will motivate and at the same

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:29.040
time we do have an active outreach effort at the moment working with

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:32.000
various vendors who are still using the system trade to try to basically say hey

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.760
this is a better way of doing it well that's good yeah that's nice I mean so

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.760
I'm glad to hear about the outreach so the thing that crosses my mind is that

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.000
see here's where it gets sticky and I again I know you're not speaking

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.400
officially just in your opinion it seems to me like if the position is we need to

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.240
stop doing this in the meantime use an extension but oh by the way that

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:57.480
extensions totally gonna break and inversion I mean that that is a

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:02.000
particular sticky situation don't you think yeah no I agree and what I guess

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.880
what not very well communicated was that at least you know speaking for for the

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:09.680
team I managed at Red Hat I mean we took ownership of making sure that that

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:16.720
extension works in Fedora okay okay and thus I mean it's it's a community

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.160
extension but of course if if you see that it breaks we will fix it to make

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:24.600
sure it works so if I install that on Fedora is that coming from the Fedora

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:29.280
repository no it does come from the extreme extension repository but we

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:33.560
would go there and fix it oh guys officially announced that he was not

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:42.200
going to continue maintaining it hmm yeah so I mean as I said we will as a

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:47.760
project you're gonna keep ah okay and I mean what you have any background on

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.840
that decision that's that's awesome to hear that thank you for telling me that

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.720
but what's the do you have any background on did that did the project

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:57.160
sort of did Fedora debate you know this is something we need to do or how did

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:02.880
that come about because I had no idea about this no I mean well this we had a

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:07.040
decision that that in universe some people who had you know an old

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.760
application where they still acquired a system tray I mean I have to say though

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:17.260
I have a couple applications that still use a system tray icon but I have

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.840
forgotten about them right because even with old UI they were sort of hidden in

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.840
a little weird corner and done at the bottom yeah yeah and so the multiple

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.680
applications that you know builder UI in a way that require it are quite few and

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:32.880
far between these days and yeah the few know about this ones we're trying to

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:38.380
work the hardest with to get moving to a different setup but but in terms of you

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:42.800
know discussion we had inside Fedora and reddit was like hey okay we know that

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.840
this needs to be there and of course we need to step up and make sure it keeps

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:51.760
working because you know well at the end of the day right we a lot of these

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.920
things you know end up also in rel and us we have to make sure over sharing

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:57.800
customers have things at work you know having thought about it for a couple of

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.760
weeks I agree they are kind of user hostile in a sense and you know the

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:05.280
thing is is if you're if we're all honest with ourselves it's a paradigm

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.560
that was that was forced upon us from Windows and it's one that we just

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:14.080
adopted on Linux to fit in and it kind of sucks it really actually sucks and so

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.440
I'm not I'm not opposed to figuring out a better way of doing it and I think

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:21.560
it's it's it's pretty decent of the Fedora project to say we're gonna try to

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:25.320
work upstream to keep this thing working and and that sounds like it worked for

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:31.960
all gnome users to not just necessarily Fedora yeah that's pretty cool and also

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:36.480
going back to the gnome 3 thing since that's I mean that's not gonna be

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:40.360
deprecated for a while anyway so that the support for this extension will

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:43.720
still have a long life even though the guys not maintaining it it's still he

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:49.160
also said it's gonna still be around for a very long time yeah yeah yeah so I

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:52.680
also just a just I'll just touch on this point just to make just a follow back

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:56.680
people that heard it might be wanted no more so trim support has been around in

01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:00.240
Fedora for a little while now but the thing that's really great now is that

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:04.920
the Fedora 27 has introduced trim support for encrypted disks which I know

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:07.920
Noah's gonna care a lot about because it's gonna greatly enhance the

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:11.680
performance of Fedora workstation on SSDs that use encryption and I know

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:15.520
that's got to be you brown bear absolutely I I don't own a computer that

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:21.000
doesn't have an SSD anymore everything has either an SSD or is envy any which

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000
you know SSDs but yeah yeah first so everything is and you know everything is

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.360
going that way too right I strongly suspect that for the rest of the time

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:32.720
that I ever buy laptops I'm not gonna buy a computer with spinning rust in it

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:36.000
I mean that's just that's just the reality of 2017 hey guys I want to get

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.920
one last plug 8 5 5 4 5 0 6 6 2 4 that's the phone number you can join us live on

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:45.280
the air for a special edition of Linux unplugged Jay is calling hey Jay you're

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:52.080
on Linux unplugged what's on your mind hey I'm calling about well I'm doing

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:58.800
tech support for club well I I was one client that I do freelance and I work at

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.800
the software developer actually but I still have one client I do freelance

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:07.840
that I'm good friends with the CEO and I was wondering how I could resolve

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:13.120
issues where I make mistakes and I don't feel like I should go for them how do

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:16.560
you how do you handle that if you if you make a mistake and you spend a lot of

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:20.520
extra time doing something and then you feel like you shouldn't build them but

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:26.360
you still spent the time to get it done yeah so part of that Jay though it's an

01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:31.200
ethics question right and the way I answer ethics questions is I simply do

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:35.800
the moccasin test if put the other person's moccasins on and walk them out

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:39.800
in their shoes and see how you feel so for example if you if they asked you

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.920
they said we want you to come install a router for us so that we can get our

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.440
four front desk machines on the internet so what you should do is take

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.960
the router out of the box and plug it into the modem and turn it on and plug

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:52.680
all the computers in and they should just come online that that's what you

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:56.720
need to do and you'd build a client for like an hour of time and in instead you

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:01.440
pull it out of the box and you know unbeknownst to you maybe you maybe you

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:04.600
inadvertently shut the web interface off and you can't figure out how to turn it

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:07.040
back on and you're trying to get in you're trying to SSH in so you're

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:09.840
calling the manufacturer what's the default password for the SSH oh yeah

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.280
well I don't know what version I have and you're doing that dance right and so

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.320
come lo and behold you spent four hours doing it is that if you were the client

01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:22.040
would you want to get billed for four hours of work for that while you're

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:26.020
while your IT guy learned how to do his job right no of course not but at the

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:29.840
same time if you get called in and the client says yeah we need our internet

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.040
went down we don't know what to do and you say well I've never been here before

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.880
tell me the layout where's your network documentation who is the last guy that

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.560
worked for you and they say yeah we don't know anything about that listen

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.520
this that closet at the end now that's where your breaker room is whatever then

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.960
it's the other one over there that closet yeah okay that's the right one so

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.840
where's the documentation we don't have any documentation there's the owners

01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:48.920
manuals I think if that's what you're looking for those are in there now if

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:52.360
you're spending time resetting username and passwords and you're spending time

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:57.280
tracing wire connections that's not I mean yeah absolutely you should bill for

01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:01.240
that and and and that comes down to again how would you want to be treated

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:06.680
and so and sometimes you take a hybrid approach to sometimes you get somewhere

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:09.920
is some you know so far into something like maybe you're tracing a cable and

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:14.200
you get to a point you say I should oh I'm an idiot I should have known that

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:17.000
this cable would run to that switch room or I should have looked for if there was

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.480
another switch closet that may be your fault that may be something you feel

01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:24.760
guilty about but at the same time unless you were told about that it's but you're

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.720
perfectly lit you're perfectly within your right I would say to build the

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:31.880
client and a lot of times what I'll do in those six in their circumstances is I

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:35.720
will I'll kind of do my no affair billing so if I look at something and I

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:39.600
said well I was technically here for six hours but I think I got about four hours

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:43.040
I think I delivered four hours of work I'm only gonna build that client for

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:47.360
four hours and I'm if I especially there's a particular client we work for

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.360
and they pay me or they would pay me if I build them for it they they would pay

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.080
me hundreds of dollars to stand in front of locked doors because they have this

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:57.400
idiotic policy that the security guy is the only guy that can come unlock a door

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:01.080
for me and so I walk up to the door and I stand there and I call in the front

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:04.880
desk and I say yeah I need somebody come it just it's ridiculous and so if I was

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.760
billing them you know and I would I would say I'm within my right if I'm

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.880
standing there for 15 minutes every time I need to get through a door I would be

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:14.920
within my right to build them are $75 an hour and I don't partly because mostly

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.680
because I value their business and I like the owner and I understand why

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.560
those security principles are in place given the nature of their business does

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:26.520
that answer your question yeah yeah because I really like to you know I try

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:33.280
and give give give my customers the the the kind of service I would like to have

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:37.400
and it and and and I knew that if if someone made a mistake and they were

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:41.040
just you know spin the wheels for a couple for a couple hours I wouldn't I

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:45.680
wouldn't want to get those for that and at the same time I just I spent time on

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:51.680
it and they did get done yeah but that's just yeah I hear you it's kind of a

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.360
different it's kind of a it's kind of an interesting thing to thread one more

01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:57.000
room do you have any thoughts as well as the answer I gave is that is that how

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:01.240
most you feel or somebody have a different opinion I agree it just it

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:06.240
depends on how much of your mistake like how much of a setback is your mistake if

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:11.120
it's if it's a something that's not that big of a deal that you know maybe cost

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:15.960
you an extra 30 minutes of time and work you could you could say that that's

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:20.560
that's something you can just kind of throw in but if it's something that you

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.400
you I think if you cause the problem that gives you yourself an extra four

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:28.560
hours I think you shouldn't really but you shouldn't really charge for that if

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.880
the mistake was solely on your fault but it was not you know well lack of

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:36.440
information or something like maybe you configured something and you come back

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:40.160
an hour later and you realize oh you have to start all over again this is why

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:44.080
you build research into your contract you build a right hours for of research

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.080
in yeah yeah and you Pat and you know that's the thing too is I and I explain

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:50.320
this to people a lot I'll say if we're gonna quote something we're gonna quote

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:53.840
high and some people you know they're put I mean I'm serious if we're if

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:59.240
you're gonna yeah over I mean 100% 100% every time you know we don't under bill

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:03.760
if I if I go into a place and I'm being honest if I go into a place and I think

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:06.800
somebody's going to if something's gonna take 10 hours to do we're gonna build

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.960
that client for 12 or we're gonna estimate them for 12 or 15 and the

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:13.320
reason for that is because I've done this long enough to know that things

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.480
come up and on the off chance that something doesn't come up well that just

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.760
offsets the number of times that something did come up and we went 10

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.000
hours over and like you said after a while you start to budget that in and

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.120
you start to get a good feel of it but if you and we'll do real-time real-time

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.120
billing we do that if you say just come and do this job fine we'll do it and

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:32.400
we'll let you know at the end how long it actually took and we'll believe for

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.480
that but if you want us to stay because it goes both ways if I'm gonna go in and

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:38.240
I'm gonna sign my name to something saying we will only bill you for this

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:41.480
many hours well I'm gonna make sure that we don't lose money on it that's just

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:45.360
the way we do things but you know more often that more often than that more

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.000
often than I'm worried about not losing money I'm worried about saving my

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.440
clients money oh yeah one of the ways I've done that recently and this was

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.880
actually with a law firm we recommended them with Ting and Ting if you're not

01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:59.960
familiar with it is a mobile service provider where you own the service and

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:05.080
you own the device I remember the first time I switched to Ting I instantly I

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:08.360
knew well there's two things I knew first of all I knew that any service

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.920
that had a URL of linux.ting.com and when I went to that linux.ting.com it

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:17.880
saved me money if I get somebody's gonna give $25 to go to a Linux URL that right

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.680
off the bat I knew that was a good thing but then after I started to get

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:24.440
involved with Ting and I was previously on a big-name carrier and they sent me

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:28.760
the phone and it felt like my phone because they're not they're not locked

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:31.320
phones they're not locked to Ting you can take it to any service you want and

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:35.160
vice versa you can go to Best Buy and buy any phone you want about my son and

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:38.000
Asus do you remember what that was Chris he showed it to you when we were in

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.800
Minneapolis ZenFone I bought him an Asus ZenFone at Best Buy and you know

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:46.040
we and I had anticipated this so I'd activated the Ting SIM card which I

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.640
have on hand I have like 10 or 15 of them that I keep around just you know

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:53.240
and we get out to the car and my son goes as soon as he opens a box I knew

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:55.920
this was coming just dad this thing doesn't have internet how do we get an

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:59.040
internet I'm like I got you buddy I got you here's your SIM card and I just

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.900
handed him a SIM card and with Ting's dashboard yeah I said it dashboard the

01:26:02.900 --> 01:26:08.560
dashboard allows me to control how much data he uses how many minutes he uses

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:11.640
and how many messages he sends and so I've gone in there and said he doesn't

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:14.880
need to be texting anyone there's nobody he knows that he would know how to text

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:17.480
he doesn't need to do that we want everything over Telegram where I can

01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.680
monitor his communications I don't care if he calls people but I don't want it

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:25.160
to last I don't he never needs more than a hundred minutes if he accidentally

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:27.800
inadvertently dial something and just leaves the phone sitting for three days

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:31.760
you know I don't want a big bill because I'm gonna be calling you Sarah or my son

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:36.480
and until we run yeah exactly exactly and so and so they're they're only pay

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:40.380
for what you use and the ability to for that granular type control absolutely

01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:45.320
fantastic linux.ting.com and huge thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:50.720
unplugged program so I have a article I don't know if you saw this Chris I

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:54.160
threw it in your kind of last minute but there is a gentleman by the name of

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:59.160
Tommy Jordan really liked the guy and basically he has a website that he runs

01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:02.440
called eight minutes of fame it's a long story about that relates to a YouTube

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.040
video that that kind of cast him into the limelight unexpectedly but he wrote

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:10.000
a very interesting article about encryption and basically the article

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.840
starts out it says we've seen it plastered all over national news these

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:16.120
last two years the encryption debate between tech companies and civilians

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.240
wanting to keep their data private while being weighed against the government's

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:22.780
desire to gain access to anything and everything that can be hunt to stop the

01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:26.880
terrorists now he goes on to say and he outlines us very very well he says the

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.720
government argues that these kinds of data being hidden behind encryption

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:35.200
provides important clues that they need to stop terrorists the data that they're

01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:37.980
able to retrieve out of a cell phone tablet or encrypted message can be

01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:41.520
viewed in simple terms and I think that I can give you an inclusive list and

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.920
then he lists them so what things can we get out of encryption well he says we

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:50.000
can get where where they have been so the GPS location when they were there so

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.760
you know when they were there the timestamp what they what they read

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:57.440
online so the browsing history stuff like that who they've talked to messenger

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:03.000
it telegram email contact lists etc how they've communicated analyzing which

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.540
apps they've used and all that stuff and then the contextual conversations of the

01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:09.920
email and then they show what files they that they've downloaded onto the device

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:13.560
but you know the one key thing that is missing out of all that stuff that we

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:17.880
could get if we just done away with encryption if we just turned encryption

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:22.120
off and it is an on-off thing and he goes so far to explain to make a real

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:24.680
big point about that that the government keeps saying they want reasonable

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:27.320
encryption there is no such thing as reasonable encryption it's a light

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:31.280
switch the light is either on or the light is off there is no in-between and

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.920
if you say if your argument is but but no what they're talking about is they're

01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:38.120
saying that they want encryption that's weak enough that the government only can

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.120
crack well then it's not encryption that's not actually encrypted if the

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.840
government you get into it try and hold the light switch in the middle of the

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:48.920
thing and it's either on or off but what the important thing is even if we do away

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:51.360
with encryption we turn that light switch off you know the one thing we

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:56.600
don't ever get why why did somebody do this why did somebody send this message

01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:02.160
why does somebody feel this way and the why is the most important aspect of it

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.840
because the why tells you what they're going to do and you know of that so

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:14.360
good I'll say this so this is this is a big problem for open source projects and

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:18.640
I haven't really figured out how to talk about it yet because I don't know how to

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:23.120
talk about it without seeming like I'm I'm like I didn't like I need to get

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:27.080
like a tinfoil hat and need to run around about the sky falling right

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:33.480
because to me I don't I don't I don't understand how the US government is

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:38.400
going to Institute laws about how encryption is implemented that affect

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.320
open source projects that are developed all over the world they can't

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:46.240
tributaries yeah I just don't understand how how can open source comply with

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:51.720
anything and and anything anything that the u.s. district just decrees

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:56.160
encryption must follow these these projects are built by people all over

01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:00.280
the world yeah and people that largely couldn't care people that largely not

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:04.320
only don't care what the US government thinks yeah but largely want to combat

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.280
what the US government thinks and the reason that that encryption exists in

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:12.600
the first place or yeah or have no reason to give a shit

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:16.720
no right yeah yeah but there are other governments that they also might have to

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:20.800
comply with that yeah the opposite well and and if the US government decides it

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:24.440
wants it well then how soon after that does China and Russia you know what all

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:27.520
the other governments want it honestly it doesn't matter if every government in

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:31.000
the world wants it because what you're fundamentally trying to do is put a

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.440
genie back in a bottle I mean it is it is it's just this to me seems like the

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:39.360
same argument is when a celebrity has pictures that are leaked and then they

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:43.760
say we want to start taking them down yeah right don't look at them I think

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:47.320
what they're gonna ask for and when I say they I mean the US government is

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:51.560
they're gonna ask for some sort of escrow system where they're not gonna

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:55.640
say give us the keys give us the backdoor put it in an escrow and then

01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:01.880
when we have a lawful when we when the FISA court gives us the lawful right to

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:05.900
peak we will go to this escrow and we will activate the backdoor so they'll

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:09.260
go where's my rubber stamp it's around here so oh there it is okay they'll go

01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:12.640
to Apple they'll go to Google and they say with your messaging platforms and

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:16.040
they'll eventually go to Telegram and WhatsApp and all of them that they can

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:21.240
and the only the only the systems like wire and signal that are better designed

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:26.000
will be immune from this everything else skype's already a victim will be in

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.360
slack I'm sure will be subject to this you know the thing is though the people

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:34.240
that care are going to know I mean it's not gonna be a secret I mean it's a

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:38.320
secret the first time and then after the first person is convicted or or their

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:41.680
messages are decrypted then then the cat's out of the bag and then everyone

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:44.200
that cares about keeping their stuff private it's gonna move to something

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:49.240
else so I don't seem like a one-burn match I would like to hear from somebody

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:52.480
from the mobile room who it may be is even outside the u.s. a bit or inside

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:55.640
the u.s. is fine but you know this is something that's gonna affect the whole

01:31:55.640 --> 01:32:01.000
world yeah to make extra one point there though I mean I have no direct

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.600
knowledge about this but I mean what the US government or any government can do

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:09.040
right they can enforce what local companies do and so I mean it's not just

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:12.920
about stopping you know well some of in London kind of guys here I mean it's

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:17.040
also about like you know catching white-collar criminals for instance in

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:20.760
in big banks or whatever and of course if you have policies in place that

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:24.640
enforces this bank to for instance provide any encryption key that used to

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:27.680
escrow that means that I can get to you know the email exchanges whatever that's

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.920
happened inside that company yeah but I I mean I don't mean to be the cynical

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:37.640
person of the room but to me it seems like anybody who wants to break the law

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:42.760
in any significant way is going to be hip enough to realize they shouldn't use

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:46.800
any system that's been proactively tapped by the US government they'll use

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:49.880
the system outside of that and there will always be system outside of that

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:54.280
and the only people subject to monitoring will be the standards regular

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:58.680
old Joe Schmoes let me pose it let me let me pose it let me pose another

01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:03.120
question to you guys the problem one of the problems with giving up encryption

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:07.000
is that if you had a guy and there's the article I'm not coming up with this this

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.020
is in the article if a guy goes through an airport and he has caught trying to

01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:14.360
bomb that airport and they take him down and they search his person and they

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:18.280
find a camera I don't think anyone in this room would argue that that camera

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:21.380
is not pertinent to the investigation of why this guy was trying to blow up the

01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:24.960
airport might contain evidence right we agree on that but the camera might only

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:29.600
contain 30 or 40 pictures when we start talking about they want access to you

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.280
know your Google photos we're not talking about the last 30 or 40 pictures

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:37.120
you took you're talking about everything you've ever done the entire scope of

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:39.640
your life when you're talking about the phone right you're talking about every

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:44.800
Wi-Fi exact point exactly and so and so who thinks that who out there legitimately

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.320
thinks that any government has the right that once you commit one crime because

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:54.040
of that one and actually really you're accused of committing a single crime why

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:57.200
who out there actually believes that the government should get unfettered access

01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:01.720
to every your entire digital life which is more and more of our actual lives

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:05.880
these days who actually thinks that's fair I would say it's it's a bigger

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:13.720
problem than that though because we can all decide as as a democracy and the

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:17.520
Republic of the United States we can all decide that's fine the land of the brave

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:21.240
and the free that we want to be screened we want our devices scanned we want

01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:26.160
everything downloaded that is totally fine and 100% as a democracy we've

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:29.360
decided it's great I'm talking like in the future we've decided we are going to

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:34.240
trade all of our freedoms for security the thing is that doesn't necessarily

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:39.560
mean that the citizens of Canada want to live that way right and the problem that

01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:44.120
open source has to address here is how do we serve a market as huge as the

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:50.040
United States that has all of these fuck crazy laws that are essentially 1984

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:55.200
draconian laws that the rest of the world except for Iran and Russia and

01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:00.200
Syria those countries have these laws in place but outside of that nobody no

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:04.640
others no other modern democracy has these kinds of laws in place so how do

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.840
we serve the United States and everywhere else and I don't understand

01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:12.240
how you're gonna have people that can contribute to one common code base that

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.080
have significantly different laws that they have to adhere to can work

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:19.480
together I don't understand how you can ship one distribution for the US and one

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:23.120
distribution for Canada when we have significantly different encryption laws

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:27.600
that fundamentally mean back doors into encryption versus no back doors I mean

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:30.640
Chris it's really easy you just have a setting in the settings you flip a

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:36.440
switch yeah totally crappy encryption we can have a dashboard American week

01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:42.800
encryption and world encryption the solution is obviously turning all the

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:46.720
US laws into internet laws and everybody has to associate to the right and we'll

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.840
all go by UTC right well that's the one logical thing I've heard in this

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:54.120
conversation but no you know it's it's going to be something interesting

01:35:54.120 --> 01:36:01.640
because this to me seems like it's largely one of those things that is is a

01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:06.840
driving force in one direction I I very seldom see anyone the government

01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:09.820
reversing its opinion and suddenly deciding well actually you know we're

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:13.060
not going to push to to try and break encryption and the one thing that we

01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:17.800
have working in our favor is this is the one time when market reality and social

01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:21.360
reality doesn't really mean anything we're really it's about the technical

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:26.480
advantages that's really what matters so I actually a funny thing about the one

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:31.360
of the recent releases from from the current government is that they they are

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:35.000
saying that they're kind of pulling back on not wanting the encryption broken but

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:39.080
you know just just make copies of everything so we can look at them later

01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:43.800
yeah yeah well it's like I said it's one of those things that I think as long as

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:48.560
we have the technical superior order superiority in our corner I think we're

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:51.120
gonna be sitting good hey guys thanks so much for joining us for this episode

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:55.160
really appreciated letting me guest host with you that'll put this episode of

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:59.920
Linux unplugged in the books you can follow us on Twitter at Westpane at

01:37:30.080 --> 01:38:00.040
negative in the freedom dimension

01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:23.880
something tells me you like having the ability to scream like a madman without

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:29.360
it actually winding up in a recording that matters long into the outro before

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:34.560
I've never heard it I felt like I was just jiving with it it was what did you

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:37.840
say was yeah that was did I play the wrong one no I'm just that we just never

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:42.960
we cut it off before that sometimes I just hard cut it you know we all really

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:47.040
oh you don't want that nice grad that's such a good fade it's good though it's

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:50.800
good right I mean I did originally and I didn't originally build that fade to

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:54.440
just let it play out but yeah you know in the last 30 weeks or so I we've

01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:59.840
started we just can't shut up because everything's too much fun that's what

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.160
the thing is yeah not only did I not only did I let it play out then I gave

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:06.920
it a good like one or two seconds before I started talking so we're Kai has a

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:12.400
nice tape cut point all right so we got to pick a title we got to pick oh yeah

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:17.160
I haven't participated in this process in a long time I'm gonna do this okay

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:22.080
the process is kind of a convoluted now no you just always it really you well

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:27.880
you go to the discord you search for your bang suggest so you can't do it's

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:31.800
not JB titles anymore I'm sorry you can go to both oh you can do both okay so

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:36.360
you got to search the search them you guys search the discord okay bang

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:39.480
suggest because you can just it turns out a discord has a great search so you

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:42.560
just search for bang suggest and you just see all of them in one result and

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:50.000
then JB titles for you know like the bot action I'm not liking these titles yeah

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.800
well what do you think we should go with what anybody like Dora quantum leap hmm

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:59.800
that's not bad but that was a very small part of the total thank you Christian

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:02.720
for joining us that's the combo thing I don't know if there was a was there a

01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:06.960
big part of the show hey before we get out of the post show I because I wanted

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.360
to mention in the main show that Dan here from elementary OS was just

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:16.400
recently over on late night Linux had a great interview they gave him a few hard

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:20.480
questions and he was he had some great answers so if you want to hear Dan have

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:24.320
to answer some tough questions go check out late night Linux do you remember

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:30.120
what episode number was Dan that's a great yeah you know I'm gonna do Dan is

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.720
what I'm gonna do is why you and I look it up is I'm just gonna fill a little

01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:36.320
bit of air time and by doing so I'm just gonna sit here and talk for a few

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.360
moments because what you want to do right is you want to Google it real

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:50.120
quick episode 24 everyone yeah episode 24 of late night Linux has this here Dan

01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:53.880
the rabbit in there and he answers the hard questions about elementary OS that

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:58.920
have been on your mind by the way we forgot something for the Mozilla review

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:03.200
there's a new chapter in the book of Mozilla right now with the quantum

01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:12.120
release it's now chapter 11 colon 14 you know the story about that well chapter

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:20.560
11 here in the United States I think means you open the Mozilla browser and

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:27.800
you're typing about colon Mozilla and you will get a chapter which normally

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:34.280
tells you about to release and the time of the release so if you have version 16

01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:42.120
it's starts with the twins of Memon quarreled and now with version with the

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:48.280
new version the book of Mozilla is 11 colon 14 which started the Beast adopted

01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:53.980
new Raymond and studied the ways of time and space and I didn't it goes on like

01:41:53.980 --> 01:42:01.720
that whoa it's some kind of Easter egg it's some kind of Easter egg hey guys

01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:08.600
hey guys Jordan Jordanism from the chat room suggested member when JB cared about

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:11.840
IRC that really seems like that'd be appropriate for the title don't you

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:15.280
think that seems like that'd be a really fucking good title for this episode I

01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:20.840
think I think it really exemplifies what happened in the episode I think we

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:23.200
talked about it a lot throughout the episode there was a lot of good

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:28.000
discussion really respectful for all of the work that one two three four five

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.320
six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty forty fifteen sixteen people put

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:35.520
into this week's episode and all the topics we covered yeah that's really

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:45.600
that's great that's thank you Jordan thank you I wanted to kick Chris's

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:50.280
nostalgia a little bit you'd mentioned open CC in the box it actually didn't

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:56.640
come with one book it came with two so it came with the user manual I don't

01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:59.920
remember when they started doing this but they put a second book in there with

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:05.760
all the printed man pages that's what it was I couldn't remember I thought so

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.440
good good memory good recollection do you have like a box around it have you

01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:15.680
looked at a box recently how did you remember that oh I I don't have my box

01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:20.000
anymore and that's depressing I threw it away oh that's sad yeah so she said

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:24.560
well yeah man printed man pages that sounds really nice though just keep it

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:31.240
right on your desk thumb through it totally searchable I love it well okay

01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:33.920
so we got a title this thing we got it we got to get a name for this thing

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:41.840
because this is this is going off the rails I got a real I got a real crash

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:45.640
course and installing applications fedora oh yeah we should talk about that

01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:48.520
the beard had to install a few apps on the door for the show today we didn't

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:53.360
even get to that a lot less fedora than I expected I I installed apps we have

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.920
five different methods or attempted to anyway you first you have the the normal

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:04.040
DNA software oh okay and you didn't go gooey first who was gooey for installing

01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:10.960
software people that like to install software these it's for people who like

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:15.800
to mess with the computer pretty easy and plus the other thing is three of the

01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:21.920
methods don't have ways to do it via the software okay I was pleased that slack

01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:26.080
had an rpm I could easily install that was nice yeah okay the second thing I

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:30.920
tried and this was actually pretty easy to get chrome installed you just add the

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:36.640
third-party chrome repo from Google are you telling me they have a repo for

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:40.600
fedora yeah that's they did the same thing for Debbie and as well I gotta be

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:49.640
honest with you I'm sorry you guys but Firefox yeah the third method which I

01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:57.720
managed to get nothing installed via is copper okay that was no good no the

01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:03.200
fourth method was enabling rpm fusion that was to get telegram installed mm-hmm

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:12.400
oh nice method because I could not get discord via rpm fusion or copper was

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:16.600
that I also had to use flatbacks oh my god I enabled a flat hub and I install

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:23.160
that via the software stuff okay so okay so let's back up for a second so what

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:27.680
did you say before discord what did you install before tell good how did so how

01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:31.440
did the telegram thing go down how does that work so did you what did you do to

01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:36.360
get telegram working rpm fusion so you added a repo yes so you did like a DNF

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:41.000
command use there's a DNF commands yeah and then did you install it via the

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.440
command line or did you install via the software center command line okay and

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:49.440
then the last thing you installed was discord and you installed that via

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:55.480
flatpak but you added a repo for flatpak yeah I enabled a flat hub and

01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:58.360
did you install it then after that via the command line or if we had known

01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:02.640
software known software interesting so it now it just shows I actually couldn't

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:05.560
figure out how to install via the command so you added the flatpak repo

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:10.240
and then you you open gnome software and you searched for discord and then

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:16.400
discord showed up it told me that the source was flab oh interesting in when

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:20.640
you want to install flat pack flat pack from the the command line you also have

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:25.800
to include the repo in the flat pack command yeah yeah yeah I'm not a big fan

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:31.760
of that it's a little convoluted but yeah that seems counterintuitive like I

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:35.360
already added the repo why is it not just searching the enabled repos yeah

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:40.360
welcome to PPAs yeah mm-hmm yeah I know this is this is so this is PPAs don't

01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:43.760
require you to tell the prepo after you haven't installed though so no but you

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:47.280
do have to do an update right so you add the PPA you add the key when you add

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:50.120
it and then you have to do an apt update and then you have to do that then you do

01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:55.600
the install it feels a lot like PPA yeah but with flatpaks you have to every

01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:00.160
time you install the app you have to specify the repo URL that's true yeah

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:06.400
that's true yeah everyone should use a UI anyway that's how we designed it say

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:10.680
again everyone should use gnome software I mean that's a whole point here to move

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:13.720
away from needing command line tools it definitely it definitely does feel like

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:17.020
that like the whole thing is pretty straightforward install the repo there

01:47:17.020 --> 01:47:21.800
right well that's true yeah adding the repo you still drop to the command line

01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:25.720
yeah I the reason I tried to do every the command line was because I was

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:28.800
already on the command line to add the repo I don't think there is a way in

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:32.360
gnome software to add it through and add it add a flat hub anyway yeah that does

01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:34.880
seem like something that needs to get I guess that does feel like a feature that

01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:39.960
needs to be added because it'd be nice yeah yeah I actually want one thing

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:45.520
we're looking to do there actually subject is we are going to start

01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:52.520
pre-populating this database with various repos so that so the setup will

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:56.160
be that when you start fedora since it's meant to be all free software you'll

01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:58.600
better get a question as part of the initial setup saying hey do you want to

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:02.400
enable third-party repositories and if you say yes a lot of these things like

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:10.360
chrome and and steam and nvidia driver and and and so on will just be

01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:19.040
pre-populated for you to download that's wonderful hmm yeah I I when I they it

01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:22.600
seems like it seems like a decent solution like I the more I the more I

01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:27.480
see distributions implementing flat pack the more I see how it really does make

01:48:27.480 --> 01:48:30.200
sense for a lot of different yeah different uses for open source software

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:36.280
yeah I think if I do use fedora in the future I'm gonna start with flat hub

01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:40.240
yes yes exactly that's what I would do too now because it seems like it has

01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:42.720
most of what I wanted like I actually just searched telegram and gnome

01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:45.440
software and now there's two different versions I have one from flat hub and

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:49.680
one from yeah our people and then you could and then the fact is you can still

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:52.660
get snaps working on there too so that kind of covers some of the other space

01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:56.360
and then it's like well what do you have left that isn't covered by those two

01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:03.120
things and the list well but thankfully they package it for the distro you want

01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:06.680
yeah I mean they're doing that work now right yeah I can see if one of these

01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:12.320
things takes off either way that I could see Google changing that if if fedora

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:16.800
supported both snap and flat back then that would solve most of the issues of

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:38.240
packaging entirely mm-hmm and I'll use app image for everything else
