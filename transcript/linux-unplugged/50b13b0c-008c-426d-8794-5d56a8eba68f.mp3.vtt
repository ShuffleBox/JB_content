00:00.000 --> 00:01.680
Hey, full-time podcaster Wes Payne.

00:01.680 --> 00:03.400
Oh, hello there, Chris.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.580
Are you ready to do a Linux Unplugged program,

00:05.580 --> 00:07.320
Mr. Full-Time Podcaster?

00:07.320 --> 00:08.840
Like we've never done before.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.200
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 266

00:13.200 --> 00:15.680
for September 11th, 2018.

00:15.680 --> 00:20.680
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

00:20.680 --> 00:23.260
that's not just covering the news this week.

00:23.260 --> 00:24.420
We're making a bit of news.

00:24.420 --> 00:25.260
My name is Chris.

00:25.260 --> 00:26.100
My name is Wes.

00:26.100 --> 00:26.920
And Joe's here too.

00:26.920 --> 00:27.740
Yo, Joe.

00:27.740 --> 00:28.580
Hello.

00:28.580 --> 00:30.100
Hello, guys.

00:30.100 --> 00:33.740
First of all, thank you for covering for me last week.

00:33.740 --> 00:35.460
Much appreciated.

00:35.460 --> 00:36.300
Much appreciated.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.120
We're back.

00:37.120 --> 00:37.960
I'm back.

00:37.960 --> 00:39.980
It's a full team this week because we

00:39.980 --> 00:41.580
have a lot to get into.

00:41.580 --> 00:43.100
We have a lot of stuff to do.

00:43.100 --> 00:44.500
We have a lot of stuff to do.

00:44.500 --> 00:45.740
We have a lot of stuff to do.

00:45.740 --> 00:47.180
We have a lot of stuff to do.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.420
We have a lot of stuff to do.

00:48.420 --> 00:49.820
We have a lot of stuff to do.

00:49.820 --> 00:54.780
We have some major announcements that I am so excited to share

00:54.780 --> 00:55.580
with you.

00:55.580 --> 00:58.420
I have been resurrected from the hospital bed

00:58.420 --> 01:00.780
and transported into the studio just

01:00.780 --> 01:02.940
to make this very announcement.

01:02.940 --> 01:05.340
Plus, we'll be getting into some community news

01:05.340 --> 01:07.380
later on in the show.

01:07.380 --> 01:09.700
So before we go any further, let's

01:09.700 --> 01:10.980
bring in that virtual lug.

01:10.980 --> 01:12.700
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:12.700 --> 01:13.260
Hey, hey.

01:13.260 --> 01:13.760
Hey, hey.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.140
Hey, hey, hey.

01:15.140 --> 01:16.100
Listen to that.

01:16.100 --> 01:16.900
That is a showing.

01:16.900 --> 01:17.380
Wow.

01:17.380 --> 01:18.300
That is a showing.

01:18.300 --> 01:21.540
And it's been a long time since I've been able to say this.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.980
Joining us this week on the program

01:23.980 --> 01:26.980
is the CEO of Linux Academy, Mr. Anthony James.

01:26.980 --> 01:27.980
Hello, Anthony.

01:27.980 --> 01:29.060
Hey, how's it going?

01:29.060 --> 01:30.380
It's going fantastic, sir.

01:30.380 --> 01:31.420
Thank you for being here.

01:31.420 --> 01:34.380
We have a big show today, so I'm really glad you could be here.

01:34.380 --> 01:36.860
Episode 266.

01:36.860 --> 01:38.580
Now, you're down there in the Tejas.

01:38.580 --> 01:39.820
I was just down there recently.

01:39.820 --> 01:43.900
In fact, if things had gone as originally planned,

01:43.900 --> 01:46.500
I would have been probably in the same room with Anthony

01:46.500 --> 01:48.140
for this episode right now.

01:48.140 --> 01:50.380
That was supposed to be last Tuesday.

01:50.380 --> 01:52.340
I was instead getting carved up by doctors.

01:52.340 --> 01:54.020
So I didn't have an opportunity.

01:54.020 --> 01:56.620
Let me just say we're all glad you are alive and well

01:56.620 --> 01:57.700
and you look great.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.740
Well, thank you.

01:58.740 --> 02:01.420
I mean, that's kind of you to say.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.140
Well, let's start with the big news

02:03.140 --> 02:04.740
before we get into the community news.

02:04.740 --> 02:06.600
It's not very often we get to be the news.

02:06.600 --> 02:07.900
We usually cover the news.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.120
We're not often the news.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.700
But this week, we are the news.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.420
I'm starting off with a big announcement.

02:13.420 --> 02:17.760
Jupiter Broadcasting is joining Linux Academy.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.820
And let me be clear, this is a great development.

02:20.820 --> 02:24.100
We are kumbayaing, as they say.

02:24.100 --> 02:29.100
And the biggest change that's happening from all of this

02:29.100 --> 02:31.140
has already happened.

02:31.140 --> 02:34.260
Behind the scenes, the biggest change

02:34.260 --> 02:37.060
is that our shows are going ad-free.

02:37.060 --> 02:39.260
No more sponsors on the shows.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.560
And that happened September 1.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.780
I don't know if anybody noticed, but it did actually happen.

02:43.780 --> 02:44.940
It was out there, right?

02:44.940 --> 02:46.740
Or not out there.

02:46.740 --> 02:48.120
And we're very excited about that,

02:48.120 --> 02:50.620
because Linux Academy is going to be our sole sponsor.

02:50.620 --> 02:52.660
We are part of Linux Academy now.

02:52.660 --> 02:54.980
So we're dropping ads, and our shows are going sponsor-free.

02:54.980 --> 02:56.860
That's the biggest change you're going to see.

02:56.860 --> 02:59.940
But behind the scenes, there has been some big news.

02:59.940 --> 03:04.860
Wes, Angela, Joe, and myself have become full-time.

03:04.860 --> 03:07.800
Well, all of us, except for Joe, have become full-time employees

03:07.800 --> 03:08.620
of Linux Academy.

03:08.620 --> 03:11.300
Joe is spending full-time working on JB shows,

03:11.300 --> 03:13.240
doing production and editing.

03:13.240 --> 03:14.700
And Wes is now on board.

03:14.700 --> 03:16.860
He's going to be in charge of our content.

03:16.860 --> 03:19.100
And he's obviously been helping me out this last week.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.440
As I've been out sick, we're going

03:20.440 --> 03:22.100
to be developing new processes.

03:22.100 --> 03:23.900
And so we have a core team now that's

03:23.900 --> 03:26.980
been forming for the last couple of weeks behind the scenes.

03:26.980 --> 03:30.420
And it's so exciting for all of us.

03:30.420 --> 03:33.620
And Wes and Joe, you guys did above and beyond last week

03:33.620 --> 03:34.500
while I was out.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.500
And you and Ang all worked together to make sure

03:36.500 --> 03:38.040
the shows kept going out.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.580
And I don't think we could have done

03:39.580 --> 03:41.380
that without this transition.

03:41.380 --> 03:43.500
And the timing just happened to work out

03:43.500 --> 03:45.340
such that it was in place.

03:45.340 --> 03:47.980
So the week that I had to go, you guys were there.

03:47.980 --> 03:49.020
And in place, you had to scramble.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.220
You had to work hard and work lots of extra hours.

03:51.220 --> 03:53.460
But it was the beginning of something

03:53.460 --> 03:56.060
we could have never have done before.

03:56.060 --> 03:57.820
And that was pretty cool.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.420
So that's been huge for us behind the scenes.

04:00.420 --> 04:02.900
And it's just been great, very exciting.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.460
And it means that long term, we're

04:04.460 --> 04:07.780
going to be able to make big investments in content,

04:07.780 --> 04:10.660
make big plans, do things a little differently.

04:10.660 --> 04:13.380
The flexibility we'll have now by being sponsor-free

04:13.380 --> 04:15.980
means we can entertain new ideas and new format options

04:15.980 --> 04:18.980
that we'd never really considered.

04:18.980 --> 04:22.340
And what's great about this is at the core of it,

04:22.340 --> 04:24.260
this is Linux Academy looking for their way

04:24.260 --> 04:26.880
to give back to the Linux community.

04:26.880 --> 04:30.860
And this is how, in one of many ways, they're going to do it.

04:30.860 --> 04:32.380
And I could tell you the numbers.

04:32.380 --> 04:33.960
Maybe I'll get Anthony to share them.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.580
But the growth that Linux Academy

04:35.580 --> 04:41.580
has seen since 2014 when they became our sponsor back in 2014

04:41.580 --> 04:43.900
has been just explosive.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.340
The numbers don't make sense.

04:45.340 --> 04:46.620
They're so big.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.000
And they've been looking for a way

04:48.000 --> 04:49.860
as they grow to give back to Linux.

04:49.860 --> 04:52.760
As they have been successful because of Linux

04:52.760 --> 04:54.500
and building content around there,

04:54.500 --> 04:59.380
there is that shared drive that we have to contribute back.

04:59.380 --> 05:00.740
So at the core, that's what we're

05:00.740 --> 05:02.600
trying to accomplish here.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.140
And we're going to contribute back

05:04.140 --> 05:05.980
in ways that Jupyter Broadcasting didn't

05:05.980 --> 05:08.020
have the means to do before.

05:08.020 --> 05:11.220
We'll be open sourcing our shows, our production pipeline,

05:11.220 --> 05:12.860
and we'll be open sourcing any tools

05:12.860 --> 05:16.380
that we create to automate our processes

05:16.380 --> 05:19.580
or validate or ensure production.

05:19.580 --> 05:21.600
We'll be doing that in an open way.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.700
We'll be setting up a GitLab instance where

05:23.700 --> 05:27.820
there'll be issues that we can track, code that you can see.

05:27.820 --> 05:29.180
We're still discussing licensing.

05:29.180 --> 05:32.620
It's all early days, but we're really excited about it.

05:32.620 --> 05:35.460
And I hope that we can help make tools

05:35.460 --> 05:39.060
that help other people create content on Linux.

05:39.060 --> 05:41.980
And we'll be using the funds that we generate via our Patreon

05:41.980 --> 05:44.940
to fund contributions to open source projects

05:44.940 --> 05:47.300
and free software.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.860
Something I want to experiment too,

05:48.860 --> 05:50.700
we're going to do swag matching, where we'll

05:50.700 --> 05:52.780
do match donations for swags.

05:52.780 --> 05:54.780
We'll help people get to events, community events

05:54.780 --> 05:56.160
that are important.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.340
And we'll even work to sponsor other podcasts

05:59.340 --> 06:01.640
in the community that are contributing something valuable

06:01.640 --> 06:03.700
back to the community.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.620
And I have a lot of experience in that area.

06:06.620 --> 06:08.760
And so I'm going to lend my services,

06:08.760 --> 06:10.500
and I'm going to work with these podcasts

06:10.500 --> 06:12.940
to maybe help them grow their community a bit

06:12.940 --> 06:14.860
and become stronger.

06:14.860 --> 06:17.100
Just as an example, this is going

06:17.100 --> 06:18.360
to manifest in a lot of ways.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.800
It's early days.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.720
But as an example of something we're already taking action on,

06:22.720 --> 06:25.140
we've decided up early on to contribute

06:25.140 --> 06:29.580
a portion of Joe's production time to the Ubuntu podcast

06:29.580 --> 06:31.620
to help them with their post-production.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.780
Because that's an example of a show that I think

06:33.780 --> 06:35.420
is just a great show.

06:35.420 --> 06:38.420
And we need more great shows.

06:38.420 --> 06:40.060
The whole idea here is to get people

06:40.060 --> 06:43.100
excited and passionate about free software and Linux.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.380
The Linux Action Show is a showcase show.

06:45.380 --> 06:47.220
They always showcase the best in Linux

06:47.220 --> 06:48.380
and the best in open source.

06:48.380 --> 06:50.520
At this show, we dive deep into the topics

06:50.520 --> 06:53.220
that matter to the users of open source software

06:53.220 --> 06:54.260
and free software.

06:54.260 --> 06:56.060
We talk about the new emerging technologies,

06:56.060 --> 06:58.140
the big trends that are coming, help you wrap your head around.

06:58.140 --> 07:01.340
We go to the source of the people that are doing the work,

07:01.340 --> 07:03.860
and we help them communicate to you what they are doing.

07:03.860 --> 07:05.300
And I want more of that, because I

07:05.300 --> 07:07.500
think that is vital to open source.

07:07.500 --> 07:10.400
We've had entire episodes where I've gotten up in my soapbox

07:10.400 --> 07:14.000
and talked about how the communication around free

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
software and open source has a dramatic effect

07:17.000 --> 07:18.460
on the community.

07:18.460 --> 07:21.260
And we want to take some steps to help the podcast

07:21.260 --> 07:23.820
and the free software projects that we use, for example,

07:23.820 --> 07:25.100
or that we get along with.

07:25.100 --> 07:28.500
We want to help everybody grow.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.140
Even if that's just they use the source

07:30.140 --> 07:32.340
that we create to help produce all of this,

07:32.340 --> 07:34.020
they use the automation tools that we

07:34.020 --> 07:35.200
extend to do all of this.

07:35.200 --> 07:41.180
Even if it's just that detached, that is a success for us.

07:41.180 --> 07:43.380
And we'll be using our Patreon funding

07:43.380 --> 07:48.780
to basically fuel all of that, because Linux Academy is taking

07:48.780 --> 07:52.300
care of our own costs, and we don't have sponsors anymore.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.020
So we'll take that Patreon funding,

07:54.020 --> 07:57.220
and we'll direct it to these types of initiatives.

07:57.220 --> 07:59.260
They'll be the funding source of our Linux community

07:59.260 --> 08:02.580
contributions and things like swag matching.

08:02.580 --> 08:06.740
But we're also going to expand the lineup on the network.

08:06.740 --> 08:09.140
We're already kind of in the next phase of this right now,

08:09.140 --> 08:12.940
and I'm very excited to announce that User Air is coming back

08:12.940 --> 08:15.060
very soon.

08:15.060 --> 08:19.820
We have a new lineup with Joe and Poppy and Daniel Fore

08:19.820 --> 08:22.680
from Elementary OS, plus a fourth seat

08:22.680 --> 08:25.820
that will be frequented by JB regulars,

08:25.820 --> 08:29.340
folks from the community, folks from Linux Academy.

08:29.340 --> 08:32.260
We'll have a good rotation there with a core set.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.460
And Joe, do you want to share the details on when

08:34.460 --> 08:37.420
people can expect that, and what sort of the cadence

08:37.420 --> 08:38.220
is going to be?

08:38.220 --> 08:41.340
So yeah, we're planning to do that every two weeks,

08:41.340 --> 08:44.540
and it's going to be released on Fridays, all being well.

08:44.540 --> 08:48.500
So the first episode, well, kind of the first rebooted episode,

08:48.500 --> 08:50.420
I suppose, will be this Friday.

08:50.420 --> 08:51.620
Yeah, isn't that this Friday?

08:51.620 --> 08:52.780
Oh, I'm looking forward to it.

08:52.780 --> 08:56.260
Error.show is the new website, error.show slash RSS,

08:56.260 --> 08:57.660
if you want to subscribe.

08:57.660 --> 08:58.780
The new site is up.

08:58.780 --> 09:00.660
We're getting things in place in the back end,

09:00.660 --> 09:03.100
and the first episode should go out this Friday.

09:03.100 --> 09:04.540
That's great.

09:04.540 --> 09:06.980
People have been asking for user error, and people

09:06.980 --> 09:08.860
loved that show, and it was just,

09:08.860 --> 09:12.060
it came down to a limitation of resources.

09:12.060 --> 09:15.220
We just knew, we knew it was a show we needed to be doing,

09:15.220 --> 09:16.700
but we knew we couldn't pull it off.

09:16.700 --> 09:17.700
It's a new world now.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.900
It's a whole new world.

09:19.900 --> 09:23.180
And so that's why Anthony, the CEO of Linux Academy,

09:23.180 --> 09:26.220
is joining us today, because I wanted to also have you,

09:26.220 --> 09:29.140
everyone out there listening, have a chance to hear from him

09:29.140 --> 09:30.820
and kind of what their motivation is and learn

09:30.820 --> 09:32.280
a little bit more about Linux Academy

09:32.280 --> 09:33.660
if you're not familiar.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.820
And I think maybe, Anthony, the place to start here

09:35.820 --> 09:39.420
is how all of this started when I came down to visit you

09:39.420 --> 09:41.820
for Texas Linux Fest, and then we just kind of started

09:41.820 --> 09:44.180
talking from there about ways to work together more.

09:44.180 --> 09:45.060
Yeah, absolutely.

09:45.060 --> 09:47.580
You know, if you don't mind, real quick, back in, what,

09:47.580 --> 09:50.900
2014, when you first had me on the show,

09:50.900 --> 09:54.340
and then we kind of started that sponsorship relationship

09:54.340 --> 09:56.300
a little bit, it was just me full time

09:56.300 --> 09:58.000
and a couple other people part time.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.700
And we really didn't have very many users.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.420
I think we had like 50 users at the time.

10:03.420 --> 10:06.180
And this is a real testament to actually the Jupyter

10:06.180 --> 10:08.500
Broadcasting community and you and everybody

10:08.500 --> 10:10.500
and all your members and all the listeners.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.060
It's actually because of them, they

10:12.060 --> 10:14.960
helped us kind of grow, specifically in the early days

10:14.960 --> 10:16.180
and even in the later days too.

10:16.180 --> 10:20.420
But if it wasn't for the Jupyter Broadcasting community,

10:20.420 --> 10:23.540
I don't know that we would be where we are today as a company,

10:23.540 --> 10:24.500
you know, Linux Academy.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.600
So honestly, it does make a lot of sense,

10:27.600 --> 10:28.980
and we're really, really excited.

10:28.980 --> 10:30.780
You know, it's hard to have different types

10:30.780 --> 10:32.940
of open source projects with what we do.

10:32.940 --> 10:34.900
We like contributing to them, but we really

10:34.900 --> 10:35.940
want to give back, right?

10:35.940 --> 10:37.700
We have a lot of training architects

10:37.700 --> 10:39.180
on staff with a lot of knowledge.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.980
We really want to give back and give back

10:40.980 --> 10:43.220
to the community that helped grow us.

10:43.220 --> 10:45.580
And it's funny, yeah, you came down because, well,

10:45.580 --> 10:47.500
it was on our April live show announcement.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.860
We were doing our 150 launches.

10:49.860 --> 10:53.500
And you were so kind to send a, I told everybody on there,

10:53.500 --> 10:57.540
we were using, well, we were using, it was a Mac software.

10:57.540 --> 10:58.580
Yeah, Wirecast.

10:58.580 --> 10:59.380
Wirecast.

10:59.380 --> 10:59.860
Yeah.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.020
And I got this email from you, and it was so nice.

11:02.020 --> 11:04.060
It was, hey, if you would like us

11:04.060 --> 11:06.940
to help you actually run Linux for your broadcasting stuff,

11:06.940 --> 11:11.220
I'll be happy to come down and set you up.

11:11.220 --> 11:12.560
And so we said, yeah, come on down.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.100
Let's hang out a little bit.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.500
And well, you flew down.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.980
We joined up at Texas Linux Fest.

11:17.980 --> 11:19.820
No, I took the RV down, that first one.

11:19.820 --> 11:21.820
Oh, that's right, you did take the RV down.

11:21.820 --> 11:24.300
That was like a, how long was that road trip down there

11:24.300 --> 11:24.800
again?

11:24.800 --> 11:28.300
It was like six days down, six days back.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.740
It seems longer for some reason.

11:29.740 --> 11:30.500
Yeah.

11:30.500 --> 11:32.540
Yeah, it did to me, too.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.080
I think I could do it in three, though.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.420
I think I could do it in three.

11:36.420 --> 11:38.020
So goals, goals.

11:38.020 --> 11:39.860
We'll set that up as a goal.

11:39.860 --> 11:43.860
Yeah, and then you come down, and we hang out quite a bit.

11:43.860 --> 11:45.060
Just had a good relationship.

11:45.060 --> 11:45.740
You come back.

11:45.740 --> 11:48.260
You know, it felt like we were having a good time

11:48.260 --> 11:49.280
and hanging out with community.

11:49.280 --> 11:50.240
Come back to the show.

11:50.240 --> 11:50.740
Help us.

11:50.740 --> 11:51.900
You spent a week there.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.720
Help us get set up with OBS.

11:54.720 --> 11:55.660
On Linux, yep.

11:55.660 --> 11:58.820
And we have you on the show, and we do kind of a co-show.

11:58.820 --> 12:00.260
And I mean, it's that point in time

12:00.260 --> 12:03.060
I knew we were going to be BFFs forever.

12:03.060 --> 12:04.420
Yeah, it definitely clicked.

12:04.420 --> 12:05.820
And it was like, well, maybe we could do this,

12:05.820 --> 12:06.820
and maybe we could do that.

12:06.820 --> 12:09.060
And then the conversation changed to, well, maybe

12:09.060 --> 12:10.380
we should just consider this.

12:10.380 --> 12:13.540
Because the thing is, is we're both content shops.

12:13.540 --> 12:15.580
Like, what we do is make content.

12:15.580 --> 12:18.100
And there's not very many people that

12:18.100 --> 12:19.980
understand what goes into making content,

12:19.980 --> 12:21.820
except for the people who make it.

12:21.820 --> 12:27.060
And that kind of click, I think, is really rare,

12:27.060 --> 12:29.460
where we lined up, and we're both making content

12:29.460 --> 12:31.300
for the Linux community.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.940
And we both understand how hard that is.

12:33.940 --> 12:36.260
And that, I think, was the seed that kind of

12:36.260 --> 12:37.980
grew from that whole thing.

12:37.980 --> 12:41.460
And now, for me, it's just a tremendous opportunity,

12:41.460 --> 12:44.860
because I'm now going to be the VP of community

12:44.860 --> 12:48.460
at Linux Academy, which is a fantastic role that gives me

12:48.460 --> 12:50.660
quite a bit of leverage to interact with the community

12:50.660 --> 12:54.700
and grow the audience and grow Linux Academy's community.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.540
And one day, bring the communities together,

12:56.540 --> 12:59.020
even possibly, if we can find a great way to do that.

12:59.020 --> 13:00.020
There's so many options.

13:00.020 --> 13:02.860
And including, it means I'll be able to go to more events.

13:02.860 --> 13:06.060
I'll be able to attend things that sometimes would have

13:06.060 --> 13:07.700
been way outside of my reach.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.900
And we may even see one day a version of LadyJuice

13:10.900 --> 13:12.780
going down the road, fully wrapped up,

13:12.780 --> 13:15.540
totally loaded as a podcast official bus one day.

13:15.540 --> 13:16.060
Hey, yo.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.060
So many possibilities.

13:17.060 --> 13:18.660
I thought that we were doing that first thing.

13:18.660 --> 13:19.420
I know.

13:19.420 --> 13:20.940
We've got to get on that.

13:20.940 --> 13:23.260
Yeah, it's really great, because you're actually

13:23.260 --> 13:26.260
part of the leadership team at Linux Academy right now.

13:26.260 --> 13:30.580
And what's so great about that is your love and passion

13:30.580 --> 13:32.620
for the community and working with the community.

13:32.620 --> 13:34.860
And that's what Linux and open source is all about,

13:34.860 --> 13:37.420
is giving back to the community, be part of the community,

13:37.420 --> 13:40.460
helping people grow, helping them stay up to date,

13:40.460 --> 13:43.140
stay in touch, learn new things quickly, so on and so forth.

13:43.140 --> 13:44.540
So it's just a really exciting time.

13:44.540 --> 13:47.780
And quite frankly, to you and the entire team, too,

13:47.780 --> 13:51.700
we're everybody, and I'm really excited to have you on.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.780
And you guys have just done nothing

13:53.780 --> 13:56.420
short of an amazing job with Jupyter Broadcasting.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.820
Your listeners are amazing, too.

13:57.820 --> 13:58.580
Well, thank you.

13:58.580 --> 13:59.380
That's very kind.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.580
And I'm really proud of what we've built here.

14:02.580 --> 14:05.980
And I never really had a big end goal in mind

14:05.980 --> 14:08.740
of being some huge podcast mega corporation.

14:08.740 --> 14:10.280
I always wanted to do it in a way that

14:10.280 --> 14:13.180
would be sustainable, that would allow us to make content that

14:13.180 --> 14:17.420
is really focused on the actual bits of the show

14:17.420 --> 14:19.460
and not focused on trying to make ad sales

14:19.460 --> 14:21.980
and not focused on trying to be flashy and click grabby

14:21.980 --> 14:24.060
so that way people want to throw money at us.

14:24.060 --> 14:26.060
And I never even wanted to entertain

14:26.060 --> 14:27.580
the idea of anything like a paywall

14:27.580 --> 14:30.060
to try to make this sustainable, because that theme, so

14:30.060 --> 14:34.180
opposite of what is natural to the free software community.

14:34.180 --> 14:39.540
And this gives us an opportunity to stay focused on the content,

14:39.540 --> 14:42.680
not worry about jumping and chasing sponsors,

14:42.680 --> 14:44.520
while also coming up with new ways

14:44.520 --> 14:46.820
to maybe talk to some of the people at Linux Academy that

14:46.820 --> 14:50.580
are just really, really massive topic experts on some

14:50.580 --> 14:51.740
of the things that we cover.

14:51.740 --> 14:53.500
I've been so, it's just incredible.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.100
There's so many resources, so many knowledgeable people

14:56.100 --> 14:57.260
at Linux Academy.

14:57.260 --> 14:58.740
Wes has had an opportunity recently

14:58.740 --> 15:00.660
to go down and meet the Linux Academy folks.

15:00.660 --> 15:02.480
He spent a little time in Texas.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.700
And you really see, it's an institution.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.220
It's an operation.

15:07.220 --> 15:11.700
And there are people there that are really smart from Red Hat

15:11.700 --> 15:14.260
and Rackspace and people that are deep into Azure

15:14.260 --> 15:16.740
and people that are deep into OpenStack, and I mean deep.

15:16.740 --> 15:18.180
And they care about it, right?

15:18.180 --> 15:19.820
This is what they live and breathe,

15:19.820 --> 15:21.260
and there's just so much passion.

15:21.260 --> 15:24.820
They're contributors in some cases.

15:24.820 --> 15:27.360
And they have been so heads down and focused

15:27.360 --> 15:28.940
on creating content that they haven't really

15:28.940 --> 15:31.220
had an opportunity to put their heads up for air ever

15:31.220 --> 15:35.040
and talk about what they do or talk about what they know.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.420
And there could be some big opportunities there

15:37.420 --> 15:39.460
for future shows and future content.

15:39.460 --> 15:43.060
So my head's spinning with all of the ideas.

15:43.060 --> 15:43.900
And I'm not kidding.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.740
I drug myself out of the hospital

15:45.740 --> 15:47.020
to be here to talk to you guys about this.

15:47.020 --> 15:47.860
I am so excited.

15:47.860 --> 15:50.140
I'm a little concerned that you referred to us

15:50.140 --> 15:51.380
as a mega corporation.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.420
I don't know now.

15:52.420 --> 15:54.060
No, I said an institution.

15:54.060 --> 15:56.060
Well, I mean, what was it that we just

15:56.060 --> 15:59.060
saw in the Dallas paper?

15:59.060 --> 16:00.780
One of the papers in the Dallas area

16:00.780 --> 16:03.080
came out and listed Linux Academy

16:03.080 --> 16:05.460
as one of the things that's attracting people to the area.

16:05.460 --> 16:07.940
I mean, they are seeing phenomenal growth.

16:07.940 --> 16:11.100
So you're humble about it, Anthony.

16:11.100 --> 16:15.020
But you have, I think, I'll just put it as this.

16:15.020 --> 16:18.300
You have a way of talking about the students

16:18.300 --> 16:22.780
and aligning people's priorities that it isn't bullshit.

16:22.780 --> 16:24.540
Like, it really registered with me

16:24.540 --> 16:27.540
because you do it even when no one's ever going to see it.

16:27.540 --> 16:30.360
When no one will ever hear about it, it's behind closed doors

16:30.360 --> 16:33.160
or it's in a private, secure chat, you still do it.

16:33.160 --> 16:37.060
And that is how I feel about the audience.

16:37.060 --> 16:39.620
And this is the same kind of respect

16:39.620 --> 16:42.320
that I have for the audience that you have for the students.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.660
And that, I think, was the thing that I said.

16:44.660 --> 16:46.900
We have a lot of common ground there.

16:46.900 --> 16:47.780
Oh, yeah.

16:47.780 --> 16:50.120
People in the chat room are asking, how do I feel about it?

16:50.120 --> 16:51.180
I'm very excited.

16:51.180 --> 16:52.700
And I think it's going to be great for the community

16:52.700 --> 16:55.620
because we'll be in a position where we can contribute back

16:55.620 --> 16:58.420
in a way we never could, which is something

16:58.420 --> 17:00.860
I've talked about for years trying to accomplish.

17:00.860 --> 17:04.800
And for me personally, it means I have things

17:04.800 --> 17:09.020
like medical insurance now, which probably just saved me

17:09.020 --> 17:12.300
from total financial ruin because I've spent,

17:12.300 --> 17:14.780
I've just gone through two visits to the ER,

17:14.780 --> 17:18.840
one major massive surgery, a week plus recovery

17:18.840 --> 17:20.060
in the hospital.

17:20.060 --> 17:23.940
And I have two months of intensive recovery

17:23.940 --> 17:26.380
at minimum ahead of me.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.940
So I could only imagine what the cost is.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.460
I have not yet even seen the first bill for the first ER

17:31.460 --> 17:32.300
visit.

17:32.300 --> 17:35.820
But I can imagine that it would be financially devastating

17:35.820 --> 17:36.780
to me.

17:36.780 --> 17:39.560
So this has been a very good opportunity for me.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.220
The timing of it worked out pretty good.

17:42.220 --> 17:45.300
Both from having Wes to be able to join us full time,

17:45.300 --> 17:47.520
to have Joe to be able to join us full time

17:47.520 --> 17:50.540
and become even more integrated in our production pipeline,

17:50.540 --> 17:53.260
which is bringing up our quality across the board.

17:53.260 --> 17:56.380
World class editor, Joe Resington, everybody.

17:56.380 --> 17:58.440
And to be able to reach out to the Ubuntu podcast

17:58.440 --> 18:00.180
and say, hey, we'd like to do this for you

18:00.180 --> 18:02.380
because we like you, and we think what you guys do

18:02.380 --> 18:05.260
is important, and we want to help make it sustainable.

18:05.260 --> 18:06.980
Having the ability to do that now

18:06.980 --> 18:09.760
is the kind of thing that I've wanted to do for ages.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.420
And I think it's what takes a Linux community podcast

18:12.420 --> 18:13.960
to the next level, when you can start

18:13.960 --> 18:16.260
to become an active participant in the community

18:16.260 --> 18:17.860
and how you contribute.

18:17.860 --> 18:19.980
So there's a lot of possibilities down the road.

18:19.980 --> 18:20.980
It's early days.

18:20.980 --> 18:22.680
We don't really have much more plans

18:22.680 --> 18:25.020
to change things immediately other than adding user error.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.440
And things that we have now are just

18:26.440 --> 18:28.860
going to get better and have more focus and attention.

18:28.860 --> 18:29.620
Yeah.

18:29.620 --> 18:33.980
Yeah, and so with that, that is our opening to the show.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.340
Anthony, is there anything else you think we should touch on?

18:36.340 --> 18:37.660
You know, I don't think it is.

18:37.660 --> 18:39.700
I just want to say it's great to have you all on.

18:39.700 --> 18:42.780
And don't underplay your situation there.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.940
Make sure you get some rest and take care of yourself.

18:44.940 --> 18:45.820
Community needs you.

18:45.820 --> 18:46.180
I know.

18:46.180 --> 18:46.580
I will.

18:46.580 --> 18:47.180
Amen.

18:47.180 --> 18:47.600
I will.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.600
Wes and Joe and Ange are going to have me covered

18:49.600 --> 18:51.300
for the next few weeks while I recover.

18:51.300 --> 18:54.540
I'll be on some shows as I can, because I love doing it.

18:54.540 --> 18:57.340
But yeah, I'll definitely be tapping the brakes a bit more

18:57.340 --> 18:58.140
and those kinds of things.

18:58.140 --> 18:59.720
A little slower on social media, but I'll still

18:59.720 --> 19:02.660
try to make my presence and try to respond to people as I can.

19:02.660 --> 19:05.100
And we need to thank Wimpy as well for stepping in

19:05.100 --> 19:05.700
for TechSnap.

19:05.700 --> 19:07.180
That was very much appreciated.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.100
Yeah, thank you, Wimpy.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.060
It was a great episode.

19:09.060 --> 19:09.700
My pleasure.

19:09.700 --> 19:10.860
It was a lot of fun.

19:10.860 --> 19:14.220
So with that all said, if you have questions about this

19:14.220 --> 19:15.820
or concerns, let me know.

19:15.820 --> 19:17.620
You can email me or you can tweet me.

19:17.620 --> 19:21.980
And I will be collecting them and creating a FAQ at some point

19:21.980 --> 19:23.460
and releasing that.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.660
I want to give the other shows on the network a chance

19:25.660 --> 19:27.980
to also collect the questions.

19:27.980 --> 19:30.380
The shows remaining, the BSD Now guys and Ask No,

19:30.380 --> 19:31.980
are all staying on the lineup.

19:31.980 --> 19:34.660
And we're excited about that too, because I think

19:34.660 --> 19:36.140
it's going to be better than ever.

19:36.140 --> 19:37.600
We'll have more resources than ever.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.460
And we don't really have, there's

19:39.460 --> 19:42.500
no editorial influence in what we'll be doing there

19:42.500 --> 19:43.420
or anything like that.

19:43.420 --> 19:44.860
They're still their shows.

19:44.860 --> 19:47.020
They own them and they get to produce them

19:47.020 --> 19:48.380
and we'll still run them.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.620
But they'll be ad-free now, because we

19:49.620 --> 19:51.740
don't have to run ads anymore to sustain them.

19:51.740 --> 19:54.140
So that's, I think, probably the biggest change there.

19:54.140 --> 19:57.060
But if you have questions about any of this, email me, tweet me,

19:57.060 --> 19:57.940
and I'll be creating a FAQ.

19:57.940 --> 20:00.500
I'll also be listening from the guys on the other shows

20:00.500 --> 20:03.980
and correlating all their questions too.

20:03.980 --> 20:05.300
What do you think, Wes?

20:05.300 --> 20:06.100
What do you think?

20:06.100 --> 20:07.820
This is just so exciting.

20:07.820 --> 20:09.900
You've said all that really could be said.

20:09.900 --> 20:13.060
The thing for me is just that you care so much about this.

20:13.060 --> 20:15.480
And this is just a move that means you and the rest of us

20:15.480 --> 20:18.340
can spend more time focusing on it, doing it, having more time

20:18.340 --> 20:20.300
to engage with the community and the audience,

20:20.300 --> 20:23.980
and just spending all of our energies making this better.

20:23.980 --> 20:27.020
I'm really excited to be working with you and Joe.

20:27.020 --> 20:28.700
It's a great team we've got going here.

20:28.700 --> 20:32.660
It's something like you have been doing in your spare time

20:32.660 --> 20:34.380
for years now.

20:34.380 --> 20:38.780
And Joe's been cramming it in as he could for a year, at least

20:38.780 --> 20:41.060
with LAN Plus, a year plus.

20:41.060 --> 20:43.700
And now it's a formal thing.

20:43.700 --> 20:44.620
It's a real thing.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.300
It's our job now.

20:46.300 --> 20:48.780
And I think it's a great team, and it's

20:48.780 --> 20:50.140
going to get even better.

20:50.140 --> 20:53.340
So it's so wonderful for us because behind the scenes,

20:53.340 --> 20:55.740
it's just super exciting.

20:55.740 --> 20:57.580
And that energy just feeds into the show.

20:57.580 --> 20:58.540
Yeah, so stick with us.

20:58.540 --> 20:59.500
I mean, this is all very new.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.380
We're not going to make a bunch of huge changes

21:01.380 --> 21:02.180
right at the start.

21:02.180 --> 21:05.100
But there's a lot building, and JB's not going anywhere.

21:05.100 --> 21:06.420
It's going to be better than ever.

21:06.420 --> 21:08.220
Mark's in the chat room from the Ubuntu Podcast.

21:08.220 --> 21:09.020
Mark, go ahead.

21:09.020 --> 21:09.780
Hey.

21:09.780 --> 21:10.620
Yeah.

21:10.620 --> 21:12.220
I mean, from our point of view, it's

21:12.220 --> 21:15.060
really good to have Joe on board doing this.

21:15.060 --> 21:18.380
It means that we can focus on the bit which we really

21:18.380 --> 21:21.180
enjoy doing, which is being up once a fortnight

21:21.180 --> 21:24.340
and having a chat about stuff, and not so much about all

21:24.340 --> 21:26.100
of the other stuff we've got to do around it

21:26.100 --> 21:28.460
to get the podcast out, which we try and automate

21:28.460 --> 21:29.420
as much as possible.

21:29.420 --> 21:31.540
But you can't automate Joe.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.940
Yeah, yeah, that is well put.

21:32.940 --> 21:35.620
Yeah, and that's exactly what we were thinking.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.820
And make it sustainable that way, make it fun,

21:37.820 --> 21:38.580
keep it going.

21:38.580 --> 21:42.300
So I'm really glad that that worked out.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.140
Yeah, so yeah, I'm elated.

21:45.140 --> 21:48.020
And I also get to be a big boss now.

21:48.020 --> 21:50.220
I'm a VP at Linux Academy.

21:50.220 --> 21:52.020
And Anthony's going to have to put up with me

21:52.020 --> 21:53.340
as part of his leadership team now.

21:53.340 --> 21:54.700
And that's going to be wonderful.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.660
Ha, ha, ha.

21:56.660 --> 21:57.980
You're going to love it, Anthony.

21:57.980 --> 21:58.380
Don't worry.

21:58.380 --> 21:59.340
I'll just be ruffling feathers.

21:59.340 --> 22:00.060
It sounds great.

22:00.060 --> 22:01.020
Yeah, it sounds great.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.060
Doesn't it sound great?

22:02.060 --> 22:03.820
Well, thank you.

22:03.820 --> 22:06.420
Thank you for coming on and chatting with us about it.

22:06.420 --> 22:08.100
You know, the Mumble Room's always open

22:08.100 --> 22:11.420
if you ever want to join us for a show and chat about stories

22:11.420 --> 22:12.380
or anything like that.

22:12.380 --> 22:15.500
And yeah, I mean, I guess if people are excited,

22:15.500 --> 22:16.660
go check out.

22:16.660 --> 22:17.700
I'm going to say this.

22:17.700 --> 22:18.500
Nobody asked me to.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.100
It's not an ad.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.820
But if they don't have a heck of a sale right now over

22:21.820 --> 22:24.460
at Linux Academy, if you're excited about this,

22:24.460 --> 22:26.100
go to Linux Academy right now and sign up

22:26.100 --> 22:28.860
because it's $299 for the year, which

22:28.860 --> 22:30.500
makes it like less than $30 a month.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.340
And correct me if I'm wrong, Anthony,

22:32.340 --> 22:34.260
but if they get that price, it stays that.

22:34.260 --> 22:35.740
Like, that's their membership price

22:35.740 --> 22:36.980
as long as they are a member.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.060
It doesn't like reset at the end of the year.

22:39.060 --> 22:40.700
Yeah, and in fact, we actually have,

22:40.700 --> 22:42.660
if you recall our pricing back in 2014

22:42.660 --> 22:44.000
when we first started talking, we

22:44.000 --> 22:46.300
have people who have never canceled their membership.

22:46.300 --> 22:47.900
And the price has always been the same.

22:47.900 --> 22:51.060
And we always like to reflect pricing for what's,

22:51.060 --> 22:53.100
I think we had like 12 videos or something

22:53.100 --> 22:54.900
back when we first talked.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.780
So the pricing was a lot different back then.

22:56.780 --> 22:59.060
They still have that same pricing regardless.

22:59.060 --> 23:01.100
So if you have it, you get to keep it forever.

23:01.100 --> 23:01.620
That's phenomenal.

23:01.620 --> 23:02.380
As an individual.

23:02.380 --> 23:05.420
So if you're pumped, if you're even half as pumped as we are,

23:05.420 --> 23:08.100
this is a really great time to sign up with that $299 a year

23:08.100 --> 23:09.260
because you can lock it in.

23:09.260 --> 23:09.940
You don't have to think about it.

23:09.940 --> 23:10.580
You just have access.

23:10.580 --> 23:11.860
When you want to learn something, there you go.

23:11.860 --> 23:12.420
Yeah.

23:12.420 --> 23:12.900
All right.

23:12.900 --> 23:15.180
Well, Anthony, I thank you very much for joining us.

23:15.180 --> 23:17.260
And enjoy your evening down there.

23:17.260 --> 23:18.900
Stay dry because I know the weather is

23:18.900 --> 23:20.540
getting crazy down in Tejas.

23:20.540 --> 23:21.900
Yeah, I appreciate it.

23:21.900 --> 23:22.780
Welcome to all of you.

23:22.780 --> 23:25.340
Really excited to have Joe and Wes and Angela and you

23:25.340 --> 23:26.540
and everybody on the team.

23:26.540 --> 23:27.860
And welcome to the community.

23:27.860 --> 23:29.180
And again, thanks to the entire community

23:29.180 --> 23:31.980
for your support on Linux Academy in the early days.

23:31.980 --> 23:34.940
That really kind of helped us make it is what it is today.

23:34.940 --> 23:37.180
And without the community, it never would have happened.

23:37.180 --> 23:39.020
So I appreciate you letting me come on, Chris,

23:39.020 --> 23:41.260
and join in on that announcement.

23:41.260 --> 23:42.980
I know it's for you guys.

23:42.980 --> 23:46.180
But I appreciate being able to come in and do that with you.

23:46.180 --> 23:48.020
And I look forward to working with everybody

23:48.020 --> 23:48.940
as we go forward.

23:48.940 --> 23:49.780
Absolutely.

23:49.780 --> 23:50.860
Absolutely.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.380
Yeah, thank you for making it.

23:52.380 --> 23:54.900
And let's keep rolling into the show.

23:54.900 --> 23:55.540
Oh, boy.

23:55.540 --> 23:56.140
There's more show?

23:56.140 --> 23:56.860
Yeah, there's more show.

23:56.860 --> 23:59.020
Again, if you folks out there have questions,

23:59.020 --> 24:01.740
send them in to me, chris at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

24:01.740 --> 24:05.100
And I'll be collating a FAQ later on.

24:05.100 --> 24:05.860
I don't know when.

24:05.860 --> 24:08.940
Once we get enough questions in, I'll put that all together.

24:08.940 --> 24:13.660
But let's talk about some things that I suspect

24:13.660 --> 24:14.980
people may be interested in.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.340
We'll just do a couple of stories.

24:16.340 --> 24:18.620
And then that'll probably wrap us up,

24:18.620 --> 24:20.660
just because I'm starting to hurt a little bit.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.100
But NextCloud14 came out this week.

24:23.100 --> 24:23.940
Oh.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.260
NextCloud14 came out.

24:25.260 --> 24:28.140
And everybody is probably kind of familiar with the whole

24:28.140 --> 24:29.140
Dropbox situation.

24:29.140 --> 24:32.540
So these announcements are even more attractive than ever.

24:32.540 --> 24:35.300
A couple of features in here, though, that I think

24:35.300 --> 24:36.300
are pretty fascinating.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.460
They're doing something called video verification.

24:38.460 --> 24:41.060
When I saw that title, I was like, what does that even mean?

24:41.060 --> 24:42.500
It's not like Face ID.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.380
It's just a way to identify the person you're

24:44.380 --> 24:46.060
about to share a password with before you actually

24:46.060 --> 24:46.940
send them the password.

24:46.940 --> 24:48.140
Camera pops on.

24:48.140 --> 24:49.180
Is this actually the right?

24:49.180 --> 24:51.220
Is this Westpane that I'm about to send this password to?

24:51.220 --> 24:52.820
Or is it somebody pretending to be Westpane?

24:52.820 --> 24:52.820
Right.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.660
I mean, so often you have to establish

24:54.660 --> 24:57.700
some sort of side channel anyway to go communicate a password.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.260
You don't often send it in the same medium

24:59.260 --> 25:00.620
that you're discussing other things.

25:00.620 --> 25:01.940
This just automates that.

25:01.940 --> 25:02.420
Yeah.

25:02.420 --> 25:06.340
So NextCloud14 is also bringing in two-factor authentication

25:06.340 --> 25:09.060
support with a new gateway system that lets you use

25:09.060 --> 25:11.820
SMS or Telegram or Signal.

25:11.820 --> 25:13.020
Hey, I use those already.

25:13.020 --> 25:14.020
That I love.

25:14.020 --> 25:16.220
That is super, super great.

25:16.220 --> 25:18.340
And then last but not least, there's

25:18.340 --> 25:20.340
been some improvements for system administrators.

25:20.340 --> 25:22.460
It's received a restructuring of app management

25:22.460 --> 25:25.100
so you can update apps across multiple categories.

25:25.100 --> 25:27.660
And the one feature they added that I think is pretty cool

25:27.660 --> 25:33.100
is NextCloud now supports logging into the system d log.

25:33.100 --> 25:35.220
And users are notified of major changes

25:35.220 --> 25:36.700
with a pop-up first on login.

25:36.700 --> 25:38.660
So like when you upgrade now, you get a pop-up saying,

25:38.660 --> 25:39.660
here's what's changed.

25:39.660 --> 25:40.980
Oh, hey, that's professional.

25:40.980 --> 25:41.460
Yeah.

25:41.460 --> 25:41.700
Yeah.

25:41.700 --> 25:42.460
So there you go.

25:42.460 --> 25:43.540
There you go.

25:43.540 --> 25:44.460
A little news for you.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.020
There you go.

25:45.020 --> 25:47.380
Of course, that's not all the news we have.

25:47.380 --> 25:50.500
No, we also have some strange developments and also

25:50.500 --> 25:53.260
really positive developments over at Solace.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.580
A distribution that we used to follow quite closely,

25:55.580 --> 25:56.780
but things have quieted down.

25:56.780 --> 25:58.300
Yeah, it's been a while since we've talked about it here

25:58.300 --> 25:58.780
on Unplugged.

25:58.780 --> 25:59.260
Yeah.

25:59.260 --> 26:01.980
And Josh over at Solace just recently

26:01.980 --> 26:05.140
posted about supercharging some of the infrastructure.

26:05.140 --> 26:06.940
And I have noticed a lot of package activity,

26:06.940 --> 26:09.620
a lot of development happening over at Solace recently.

26:09.620 --> 26:13.220
But when you read through the changes in the infrastructure,

26:13.220 --> 26:17.580
it appears that the core team that remains, SANS IKEE,

26:17.580 --> 26:21.780
was unable to maintain that infrastructure fully.

26:21.780 --> 26:25.100
And they were unable to get communications with IKEE

26:25.100 --> 26:26.860
to take control.

26:26.860 --> 26:29.420
And it also sort of lined up with,

26:29.420 --> 26:31.140
while IKEE I think was traveling,

26:31.140 --> 26:34.020
and they say, because of the timing of these upgrades

26:34.020 --> 26:37.340
and our lack of access to the solaceproject.com domain,

26:37.340 --> 26:39.780
Brian and I are going to be shifting Solace services over

26:39.780 --> 26:42.900
to a new getsol.us domain.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.740
They're hoping it's a temporary measure,

26:44.740 --> 26:46.340
but it's unfortunate the timing of this

26:46.340 --> 26:48.540
is lined up with IKEE's move to England.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.020
However, we take full responsibility

26:50.020 --> 26:54.100
for not have prioritizing for several bus factor issues that

26:54.100 --> 26:56.060
would have made this transition smoother.

26:56.060 --> 26:57.340
So I'm assuming the transition is

26:57.340 --> 26:59.820
that IKEE is no longer involved with the Solace project.

26:59.820 --> 27:02.820
But was maintaining a lot of that core infrastructure.

27:02.820 --> 27:05.380
There's not really clear communication here

27:05.380 --> 27:06.580
if that's the case or not.

27:06.580 --> 27:07.420
Right.

27:07.420 --> 27:09.220
Obviously, there's problems of some level.

27:09.220 --> 27:11.100
They don't have access now exactly why

27:11.100 --> 27:14.820
and how much communication that we don't know.

27:14.820 --> 27:19.780
It's very odd, and it really pisses me off

27:19.780 --> 27:21.140
because it means Noah was right.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.220
And I just hate that.

27:22.220 --> 27:24.900
I just hate it when Noah's right, because he and I would

27:24.900 --> 27:25.740
get into arguments.

27:25.740 --> 27:28.100
And I'd say, no, Solace is different.

27:28.100 --> 27:30.420
IKEE is a passionate visionary.

27:30.420 --> 27:31.920
And he would say, it doesn't matter.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.500
They're a small distribution, and they disappear,

27:33.500 --> 27:35.380
and then you get screwed.

27:35.380 --> 27:37.660
And I would argue back, but this time it's different.

27:37.660 --> 27:38.820
This time it's different.

27:38.820 --> 27:40.120
Look, he's gone full time now.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.660
He's gone full time.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.660
It's so different, Noah.

27:42.660 --> 27:43.240
You're so wrong.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.380
He was completely right.

27:44.380 --> 27:45.380
Or, I mean, was he?

27:45.380 --> 27:48.420
I mean, there's still, there is, it's getting supercharged now.

27:48.420 --> 27:51.460
Yeah, I hope, maybe, maybe, you might be right.

27:51.460 --> 27:53.900
Maybe there's a chance.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.700
I wonder, though, I'd kind of like to open that up

27:55.700 --> 27:56.500
to the mumble room.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.900
What happens when the main visionary driver

27:58.900 --> 28:02.460
behind a project fades away is, are the projects,

28:02.460 --> 28:04.940
are they ever really the same?

28:04.940 --> 28:06.820
I'm trying to think of some examples of like,

28:06.820 --> 28:08.100
I'm trying to think of maybe some projects we'd

28:08.100 --> 28:08.900
know of that had a.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.940
Python's a recent example, but a little too new

28:10.940 --> 28:12.180
to comment on how it goes.

28:12.180 --> 28:13.260
But that same kind of vein, though.

28:13.260 --> 28:14.540
You're on the right track there.

28:14.540 --> 28:15.180
I mean, if you think about it, there's

28:15.180 --> 28:17.540
a lot of projects that were started in the Linux world

28:17.540 --> 28:19.540
that were, that the people who started it

28:19.540 --> 28:20.940
are nowhere even near it.

28:20.940 --> 28:21.900
Yeah, like some of, like, you mean

28:21.900 --> 28:23.340
you're talking just like old, old projects that

28:23.340 --> 28:24.020
have just been around forever?

28:24.020 --> 28:24.580
Yeah.

28:24.580 --> 28:26.420
And like the big, like a lot of the big ones,

28:26.420 --> 28:28.940
like most of the big ones have, the people who started those

28:28.940 --> 28:30.300
are nothing to do with it anymore.

28:30.300 --> 28:30.740
OK.

28:30.740 --> 28:31.380
OK.

28:31.380 --> 28:34.380
A good example would be like Emacs.

28:34.380 --> 28:34.940
Yeah.

28:34.940 --> 28:35.460
GCC.

28:35.460 --> 28:38.340
Or Gnome, or Debian, or KDE.

28:38.340 --> 28:40.380
Ooh, Gnome, yeah, Gnome is a good one.

28:40.380 --> 28:41.020
You're right.

28:41.020 --> 28:41.780
You're right.

28:41.780 --> 28:43.180
What about things like Budgie, though?

28:43.180 --> 28:46.180
Like Budgie seemed like it was, you know,

28:46.180 --> 28:48.260
sort of an Aiki-specific creation.

28:48.260 --> 28:51.740
Like, does Solus now continue their investment

28:51.740 --> 28:55.060
in Budgie, which is based on some maybe older technologies

28:55.060 --> 28:56.340
that were going to get replaced?

28:56.340 --> 28:58.340
Solus and Budgie aren't the same thing, though, right?

28:58.340 --> 28:58.580
Right.

28:58.580 --> 29:00.820
But is there a default desktop environment?

29:00.820 --> 29:01.500
Well, it is.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.100
But it's a desktop environment.

29:03.100 --> 29:05.820
There's nothing to say that Solus couldn't live on using

29:05.820 --> 29:07.540
another desktop environment as its default.

29:07.540 --> 29:07.940
Right.

29:07.940 --> 29:10.620
That's what I was just speculating is maybe Plasma.

29:10.620 --> 29:12.860
There's a lot of effort in the Gnome version of it.

29:12.860 --> 29:14.180
Right, right, right.

29:14.180 --> 29:15.020
That is true.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.740
And Wes just did a little review of Gnome 3.3.0

29:17.740 --> 29:19.660
on Linux Action News last week.

29:19.660 --> 29:21.820
Sounds like you're running it right now, too, yeah?

29:21.820 --> 29:22.980
Yes, I am.

29:22.980 --> 29:23.980
Yeah, all right.

29:23.980 --> 29:27.020
So maybe it's a, maybe it's a, right now,

29:27.020 --> 29:28.980
we'll just call it a transition.

29:28.980 --> 29:30.140
And it could be a good thing.

29:30.140 --> 29:31.180
It could be a bad thing.

29:31.180 --> 29:33.760
I mean, really, it seems like Josh and the folks

29:33.760 --> 29:36.380
around the project are still working their butts off on it.

29:36.380 --> 29:37.500
Like, I was just looking at some of the updates.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.820
Like, they're still cranking.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.100
It's a hard question to answer, right?

29:40.100 --> 29:41.620
Like, I think you'd be hard pressed

29:41.620 --> 29:44.220
to pick distros at random and see, well,

29:44.220 --> 29:45.700
how real is that bus factor?

29:45.700 --> 29:46.980
How much community support is there?

29:46.980 --> 29:49.340
Or is this really the work of one or two people?

29:49.340 --> 29:50.180
Yeah.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.600
It's an interesting case study.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.440
Yeah, yeah.

29:52.440 --> 29:55.020
And I find, I find every time this happens,

29:55.020 --> 29:57.120
you do have to take each incident

29:57.120 --> 29:59.300
into its own, like, individual space.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.300
Like, you can't immediately lump in, like,

30:01.300 --> 30:03.640
past projects that have faded away and things like that.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.140
But it's tempting.

30:05.140 --> 30:06.220
I'm certainly tempted.

30:06.220 --> 30:08.340
People said things about Solos changing things

30:08.340 --> 30:12.620
and it was going to end badly and it didn't, so far.

30:12.620 --> 30:14.020
And when they went rolling, it didn't, like,

30:14.020 --> 30:15.420
they didn't really collapse or anything.

30:15.420 --> 30:16.260
Right, right.

30:16.260 --> 30:18.480
Yeah, there have been, yeah, the sky's falling calls before.

30:18.480 --> 30:19.980
Joe, you've been awfully quiet on this topic.

30:19.980 --> 30:21.700
You don't have thoughts on this?

30:21.700 --> 30:22.820
I have a lot of thoughts on it,

30:22.820 --> 30:24.780
but it's very awkward for me because obviously,

30:24.780 --> 30:28.020
I worked with iKey for best part of a year

30:28.020 --> 30:31.400
on late night Linux and had a lot of off-air conversations

30:31.400 --> 30:33.640
with him and have a lot of insight into this,

30:33.640 --> 30:36.740
but I don't know how much to share publicly.

30:36.740 --> 30:39.860
I mean, it was quite clear that he wasn't that happy

30:39.860 --> 30:41.940
with his life and he made some major changes.

30:41.940 --> 30:44.420
He posted all over Google Plus about it.

30:44.420 --> 30:47.620
You know, how he was getting a bike and getting fit

30:47.620 --> 30:48.980
and losing weight and, you know,

30:48.980 --> 30:51.100
paying attention to his appearance and everything.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.820
And then suddenly, he says that he's going to move to England

30:53.820 --> 30:55.900
and, you know, I think he'd said on air that moving

30:55.900 --> 30:57.780
to England was not something that he wanted to do.

30:57.780 --> 30:59.860
Even going there for things like Fostalk Live

30:59.860 --> 31:02.780
and Oddcamp were just not on his agenda.

31:02.780 --> 31:05.460
And then suddenly, he goes over there and then goes AWOL.

31:05.460 --> 31:07.700
I mean, there's a post on the Solus forum,

31:07.700 --> 31:11.340
someone asking, this is a couple of weeks ago, where's iKey?

31:11.340 --> 31:12.860
You know, when he first moved over to England,

31:12.860 --> 31:15.900
he posted about having the flu and, you know,

31:15.900 --> 31:18.260
which is not surprising, you know, when you do,

31:18.260 --> 31:22.580
he talked about driving for nearly 12 hours

31:22.580 --> 31:24.420
or something from Ireland to England.

31:24.420 --> 31:27.180
And if you do that without sleeping and stuff,

31:27.180 --> 31:28.900
it's not a surprise going to somewhere new

31:28.900 --> 31:30.460
that you're going to get something like flu

31:30.460 --> 31:33.480
and be potentially laid up for a couple of weeks.

31:33.480 --> 31:37.420
But then one of the devs replies saying that

31:37.420 --> 31:39.220
he was struggling to get an internet connection.

31:39.220 --> 31:42.840
Now, there are very few places where you can't get

31:42.840 --> 31:45.420
at least some internet connection to at least

31:45.420 --> 31:47.880
talk to the team and sort out this domain issue.

31:47.880 --> 31:50.420
It's not a good sign when you have to change domain

31:50.420 --> 31:51.260
for your project.

31:51.260 --> 31:54.780
It means that whoever was controlling that domain

31:54.780 --> 31:57.220
cannot be contacted or is hostile.

31:57.220 --> 31:59.300
I don't think that he's hostile in any way.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.420
I think it's just that he's disappeared.

32:01.420 --> 32:05.540
His life priorities changed, shifted,

32:05.540 --> 32:10.300
and clearly he's not involved with this project anymore.

32:10.300 --> 32:11.740
You only have to look at the evidence.

32:11.740 --> 32:14.540
If you look at the fabricator for Solace,

32:14.540 --> 32:17.340
you look at the GitHub, you know, he hasn't committed,

32:17.340 --> 32:18.900
you know, he's not pushed any commits for a long,

32:18.900 --> 32:21.180
long time now since July.

32:21.180 --> 32:24.220
And he's just not involved with the project anymore.

32:24.220 --> 32:28.220
And it's a shame to me that Josh is running this thing

32:28.220 --> 32:30.020
and not being straightforward about that.

32:30.020 --> 32:31.260
I mean, if you read between the lines,

32:31.260 --> 32:34.340
you can see that clearly Aiki isn't involved.

32:34.340 --> 32:35.820
And I just don't understand why Josh

32:35.820 --> 32:36.820
doesn't come out and say it.

32:36.820 --> 32:38.820
I've messaged him about that.

32:38.820 --> 32:40.400
And he just didn't reply to me.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.660
And I can see why he would want to be a bit cagey

32:42.660 --> 32:43.940
hoping that Aiki's coming back.

32:43.940 --> 32:46.540
But at some point you just have to admit it

32:46.540 --> 32:49.500
and say to your community, Aiki is gone

32:49.500 --> 32:51.380
and we're plowing on without him.

32:51.380 --> 32:53.080
I don't know that you can necessarily

32:53.080 --> 32:54.580
draw that conclusion though.

32:54.580 --> 32:58.180
I mean, from the outside, it's very easy to speculate,

32:58.180 --> 33:00.140
you know, someone hasn't posted,

33:00.140 --> 33:02.020
they've not done any development

33:02.020 --> 33:03.740
and we've not heard from them for a while.

33:03.740 --> 33:05.780
But yes, real life gets in the way,

33:05.780 --> 33:09.420
whether it's, you know, children or changing country

33:09.420 --> 33:12.900
or surgery or getting married or whatever it might be,

33:12.900 --> 33:13.820
things get in the way.

33:13.820 --> 33:16.580
And sometimes you want to go offline for a bit

33:16.580 --> 33:18.060
and you want to do whatever you want to do

33:18.060 --> 33:19.060
to get your life in order.

33:19.060 --> 33:22.380
And that doesn't mean that he's gone.

33:22.380 --> 33:23.380
It just means that he's not here.

33:23.380 --> 33:24.980
Now we've had people in the Ubuntu community

33:24.980 --> 33:28.220
who've disappeared, like properly disappeared.

33:28.220 --> 33:29.740
And then they just pop up out of the woodwork

33:29.740 --> 33:32.740
years later and say, hey, you remember me?

33:32.740 --> 33:34.140
And everyone's like, yeah, welcome back,

33:34.140 --> 33:36.380
come on back in and welcome them back.

33:36.380 --> 33:39.580
You don't have to like have a funeral for them.

33:39.580 --> 33:42.660
Right, okay, that is one thing to just disappear, right?

33:42.660 --> 33:43.840
And some people do that.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.660
And, you know, if Aiki had just disappeared,

33:46.660 --> 33:49.660
but he is the lead, the founder of this project

33:49.660 --> 33:52.900
who it seems controlled the main domain for them.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.860
And we're not talking about just the website here

33:54.860 --> 33:56.220
or the forums or the fabricator,

33:56.220 --> 33:58.060
we're talking about the repos and everything.

33:58.060 --> 33:59.060
Yeah, that's a mistake.

33:59.060 --> 34:01.340
You know, something has gone badly wrong here.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.180
Oh, yeah, I'm a glass half full kind of guy.

34:04.180 --> 34:05.620
I think I see it both ways.

34:05.620 --> 34:06.580
I think Poby's right.

34:06.580 --> 34:08.700
You know, people need to human up sometimes.

34:08.700 --> 34:10.620
I have changes I've got to make.

34:10.620 --> 34:12.980
And, you know, I've got to deal with that.

34:12.980 --> 34:15.580
And Aiki probably went through something similar.

34:15.580 --> 34:18.220
At the same time, when you create something

34:18.220 --> 34:22.740
like a semi-popular to popular Linux distribution desktop,

34:22.740 --> 34:25.100
there is a responsibility to the end users as well.

34:25.100 --> 34:28.100
Like there is a contract essentially there

34:28.100 --> 34:29.540
that you're making when you're saying,

34:29.540 --> 34:33.380
I'm making this product and it's like Josh writes

34:33.380 --> 34:36.340
in the post, like if you don't plan for the bus factor,

34:36.340 --> 34:39.140
then it's your responsibility to take care of it

34:39.140 --> 34:42.340
and be at least communicative of like domain passwords

34:42.340 --> 34:43.300
and things like that.

34:43.300 --> 34:44.620
So I can see both sides of it.

34:44.620 --> 34:48.500
I hope that the end result is the Solace project continues

34:48.500 --> 34:50.740
and Aiki is able to make whatever changes he needs

34:50.740 --> 34:51.940
to be happy.

34:51.940 --> 34:53.580
That would really be the best case scenario.

34:53.580 --> 34:57.500
And I think as someone who's enjoyed Solace,

34:57.500 --> 34:59.700
I have nothing but support for the current team.

34:59.700 --> 35:01.900
They're all good folks and they are all hard workers.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.140
So hopefully it works out.

35:03.140 --> 35:03.980
What do you think?

35:03.980 --> 35:05.860
There's plenty to be hopeful for here.

35:05.860 --> 35:07.580
And you're right, it is complicated, especially in this.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.860
This is something we all worry about.

35:09.860 --> 35:12.380
Maybe this can be a good example if you are out there

35:12.380 --> 35:13.580
and looking to start your own distro

35:13.580 --> 35:14.900
or working on your distro.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.060
Bus factor is real.

35:16.060 --> 35:18.860
And especially when you're volunteering your time

35:18.860 --> 35:21.740
to a project that you just have, you know, just spare time,

35:21.740 --> 35:22.780
anything can happen.

35:22.780 --> 35:24.380
We've had a great number of examples.

35:24.380 --> 35:26.140
Get that taken care of early, at least, you know,

35:26.140 --> 35:28.140
if you have trusted people that you can share credentials

35:28.140 --> 35:30.660
or set up a system to do that.

35:30.660 --> 35:33.260
Wimpy and I, and I know you too, Wes,

35:33.260 --> 35:35.500
but Wimpy and I have talked about it off air quite a bit,

35:35.500 --> 35:37.420
is, you know, we're big fans of automating

35:37.420 --> 35:39.820
as much as you can of processes like this.

35:39.820 --> 35:42.180
So that way things are more push button,

35:42.180 --> 35:43.820
they're not as manual and you can hand,

35:43.820 --> 35:45.220
it's easy to hand off something like that.

35:45.220 --> 35:48.780
Automation often forms a sort of documentation as well.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.780
I'm always sort of impressed with the things

35:50.780 --> 35:52.060
that Wimpy's automated.

35:52.060 --> 35:54.100
You know, we've looked at, it's pod published, right?

35:54.100 --> 35:56.500
Wimpy that you've tooled away at for a while.

35:56.500 --> 35:58.380
Brilliant little system that maybe we can help with

35:58.380 --> 36:01.100
someday, you know, and add things to it,

36:01.100 --> 36:03.220
like chapter markers, chapters.

36:03.220 --> 36:04.060
But yeah.

36:04.060 --> 36:04.900
Yeah, that would be good.

36:04.900 --> 36:05.940
Yeah, it would.

36:05.940 --> 36:08.420
And I really think that's the way to do it, you know,

36:08.420 --> 36:12.500
is try to build a system that you can hand off.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.580
And I am learning that very hard this last week.

36:15.580 --> 36:17.180
And it's an easy thing to say, right?

36:17.180 --> 36:18.700
Of course, because we all know it,

36:18.700 --> 36:20.260
we think in the back of our heads,

36:20.260 --> 36:21.380
but you're busy and you're just trying to get

36:21.380 --> 36:22.820
the next show done or whatever it is,

36:22.820 --> 36:24.980
but it is a serious thing.

36:24.980 --> 36:26.260
If you ever wind up in the hospital

36:26.260 --> 36:27.940
and you're sitting there responding to work questions

36:27.940 --> 36:30.860
in the hospital bed, it's not fun.

36:30.860 --> 36:32.780
So in the case of pod publish,

36:32.780 --> 36:35.700
my circumstances were fortunately much more luxurious

36:35.700 --> 36:36.740
than yours, Chris.

36:36.740 --> 36:40.700
I was away working and then away on holiday,

36:40.700 --> 36:42.100
which meant that I wasn't involved

36:42.100 --> 36:44.300
in the Ubuntu podcast for a month.

36:44.300 --> 36:46.780
But because we've created pod publish

36:46.780 --> 36:49.260
and that tool automates so much,

36:49.260 --> 36:52.580
Popeye and Mark were able to publish those episodes

36:52.580 --> 36:53.540
that I wasn't involved in,

36:53.540 --> 36:55.940
because normally I do the publishing bit.

36:55.940 --> 36:57.180
But because that tool is there

36:57.180 --> 37:00.380
and it automates 99% of what you need to do,

37:00.380 --> 37:02.740
it was trivial for them to just keep on running.

37:02.740 --> 37:04.420
That's exactly it.

37:04.420 --> 37:06.140
So that's really all I have planned for us today.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.300
I wanted to have those conversations

37:07.300 --> 37:09.580
and I wanted to share our big news.

37:10.420 --> 37:12.380
I guess too, we could take a moment

37:12.380 --> 37:14.380
if anyone in the Mumble Room has questions or thoughts

37:14.380 --> 37:17.780
about the announcement of JB and Linux Academy joining up,

37:17.780 --> 37:21.260
but also the audience is welcome to submit them via email.

37:21.260 --> 37:23.740
Yeah, reach out to the host that you are curious about

37:23.740 --> 37:24.700
or just the network in general.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.620
Yeah, and I guess I'd leave too

37:26.620 --> 37:28.980
with just maybe expect to see a little less of me

37:28.980 --> 37:30.380
for a while, I'll still be around,

37:30.380 --> 37:32.060
but I won't be as working as much

37:32.060 --> 37:34.020
because I'm gonna have to take days off

37:34.020 --> 37:35.540
and whatnot for recovery.

37:35.540 --> 37:38.020
Quiet force in the background, keeping things going.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.020
I only really got my voice back a couple of days ago

37:40.020 --> 37:41.500
because they put a tube down my throat

37:41.500 --> 37:42.500
to breathe me, you know?

37:42.500 --> 37:45.380
And so I'm still, it's a little scratchy right now even.

37:45.380 --> 37:47.500
So that probably means as the voice runs out,

37:47.500 --> 37:48.340
it's time to wrap it up.

37:48.340 --> 37:50.940
I know these episodes have been short recently

37:50.940 --> 37:52.060
and I do apologize for that

37:52.060 --> 37:53.900
because I don't intend them to be less than an hour,

37:53.900 --> 37:55.660
but it is what we've been working with

37:55.660 --> 37:57.220
because it turns out I had been broadcasting

37:57.220 --> 37:59.500
for a few weeks in a pretty bad situation.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.300
I didn't realize how bad my situation was.

38:01.300 --> 38:03.140
And so I was just pushing through it,

38:03.140 --> 38:05.380
thinking it'd get better and it didn't.

38:05.380 --> 38:06.220
And so there you have it.

38:06.220 --> 38:08.140
So they have been a little shorter, I apologize,

38:08.140 --> 38:09.900
but we've packed so much into this episode

38:09.900 --> 38:12.540
and we have so much in the works and so much planned

38:12.540 --> 38:15.540
that trust us, that's just the beginning really.

38:15.540 --> 38:18.140
And with all of that, I'll add,

38:18.140 --> 38:21.060
go get more of Mark and Wimpy and Popey

38:21.060 --> 38:24.500
over at the Ubuntu Podcast, ubuntupodcast.org,

38:24.500 --> 38:26.860
and keep an eye out for User Air,

38:26.860 --> 38:30.180
starring one Mr. Popey, Joe, Daniel Foray,

38:30.180 --> 38:32.780
and your friends that'll be joining from time to time

38:32.780 --> 38:34.020
on the User Air show.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.940
It's error.show.

38:35.940 --> 38:36.780
Error.show.

38:36.780 --> 38:39.500
And error.show.rss for the feed.

38:39.500 --> 38:42.980
And like Joe said, there should be a new episode on Friday

38:42.980 --> 38:44.700
and it'll be kicking off from there.

38:44.700 --> 38:45.820
Super excited about that.

38:45.820 --> 38:48.820
It should be in all of the podcast directories

38:48.820 --> 38:49.980
and whatnot already.

38:49.980 --> 38:51.340
So go get subscribed.

38:51.340 --> 38:53.980
Go get more Wes Payne at TechSnap.systems

38:53.980 --> 38:56.180
where you can hear a recent special episode

38:56.180 --> 38:58.340
with one Mr. Wimpy, which was fantastic.

38:58.340 --> 38:59.180
So much fun.

39:00.300 --> 39:02.100
The one thing that's been kind of neat for me

39:02.100 --> 39:05.420
is I really enjoy you and Joe on LAN

39:05.420 --> 39:08.260
and I really enjoyed you and Wimpy on TechSnap.

39:08.260 --> 39:10.380
So I've been getting to listen to more shows.

39:10.380 --> 39:11.980
I have, which has been useful

39:11.980 --> 39:14.180
because I've had a lot more downtime recently.

39:14.180 --> 39:15.260
Glad to help.

39:15.260 --> 39:17.340
So it actually has been pretty neat for me,

39:17.340 --> 39:18.620
but I've been getting a lot of notes

39:18.620 --> 39:20.820
from people asking how I'm doing.

39:20.820 --> 39:22.220
A lot of people assume I'm on vacation,

39:22.220 --> 39:23.580
which is flattering.

39:23.580 --> 39:24.420
Not the case.

39:24.420 --> 39:25.260
We wish.

39:25.260 --> 39:26.100
I do wish that.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.180
But in the meantime, the shows will go on

39:28.180 --> 39:31.540
and I will be back in full health in short.

39:31.540 --> 39:34.180
And we have so much in the works.

39:34.180 --> 39:35.420
I've never been this excited.

39:35.420 --> 39:36.380
Stay tuned.

39:36.380 --> 39:38.860
We've got a great team now, full-time team.

39:38.860 --> 39:41.500
We're working for a company that knows content

39:41.500 --> 39:44.180
who has developers and marketing

39:44.180 --> 39:46.220
and like actual departments of people

39:46.220 --> 39:48.980
and PMOs that can help us make project plans

39:48.980 --> 39:51.300
and is behind us contributing to open source

39:51.300 --> 39:54.020
and sending me to events and all of it.

39:54.020 --> 39:58.860
It's just gonna be a huge, huge upgrade for us.

39:58.860 --> 40:00.260
So we're very excited.

40:00.260 --> 40:01.380
We'll be sharing more details

40:01.380 --> 40:02.980
about the projects we plan to open source,

40:02.980 --> 40:04.620
the licensing that we'll be choosing

40:04.620 --> 40:06.500
and all of that in future episodes.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.100
And I hope we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

40:09.100 --> 40:14.100
We'll be right back.

40:39.100 --> 40:44.100
Chris, I think you should go for a sit down

40:44.420 --> 40:46.180
and Eric, the IT guy should tell us all about

40:46.180 --> 40:47.900
the Libre Application Summit.

40:47.900 --> 40:49.220
Oh, you're right.

40:49.220 --> 40:50.940
Oh, thank you for reminding me.

40:50.940 --> 40:53.500
Oh, I got so, I got so distracted by all the news.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.420
Eric, why don't we spend a little of the post-show

40:55.420 --> 40:56.860
talking about the Libre Application Summit

40:56.860 --> 40:58.660
and I will, I'll sit down and you can have the floor.

40:58.660 --> 41:00.180
What do you say?

41:00.180 --> 41:01.820
All right, sounds good.

41:01.820 --> 41:04.660
I mean, I did unpack my entire Jeep just for you, Chris.

41:04.660 --> 41:07.060
Well, you know what, the good thing is the post-show

41:07.060 --> 41:08.580
people will be listening to because it's a short show.

41:08.580 --> 41:10.300
So it's basically in the show.

41:10.300 --> 41:11.140
How was it?

41:11.140 --> 41:12.740
How was the whole thing?

41:12.740 --> 41:14.460
I had an absolute blast.

41:14.460 --> 41:18.460
I mean, there's about 60 unique people there.

41:18.460 --> 41:20.380
We averaged about 40 a day.

41:20.380 --> 41:23.820
The talks just got better and better every day.

41:23.820 --> 41:26.660
I think in the long run, going to that conference

41:26.660 --> 41:29.020
is going to cost me a ton of money.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.180
I got to tour System 76.

41:31.180 --> 41:36.060
I got to sit and talk with pretty much their entire staff.

41:36.060 --> 41:40.460
And I really loved Craig and his vision for 76

41:40.460 --> 41:45.460
and then also attended a talk from Purism about the Librem.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.940
Kind of the short version of that was that

41:50.220 --> 41:55.220
I feel like a phone, whether it was built for privacy

41:56.940 --> 41:58.740
or just built to run Linux is something

41:58.740 --> 42:00.060
that our community needs.

42:01.460 --> 42:04.060
At this point, I'm probably going to pre-order it

42:04.060 --> 42:07.300
just because I feel like that's something

42:07.300 --> 42:08.140
that needs to happen.

42:08.140 --> 42:10.420
It doesn't matter how hard or how long it takes

42:10.420 --> 42:13.660
to get there, I feel like that's just something we need.

42:14.820 --> 42:17.700
But as you hear a lot from people that go to conferences,

42:17.700 --> 42:20.180
the best part was literally the hallway track.

42:20.180 --> 42:22.820
It was, we had really long breaks

42:22.820 --> 42:25.580
and people would pull out their laptops

42:25.580 --> 42:30.580
and there's folks from Red Hat, namely the Flatpak Project.

42:30.580 --> 42:35.220
In just about every talk, there was questions

42:35.220 --> 42:38.500
from the Flatpak guys about how they're developing

42:38.500 --> 42:42.220
applications and whether or not they could put that

42:42.220 --> 42:43.060
into a Flatpak.

42:43.060 --> 42:46.220
I mean, the only thing they didn't try to put into a Flatpak

42:46.220 --> 42:47.060
was lunch.

42:48.620 --> 42:50.140
It was a great conference.

42:50.140 --> 42:52.380
One of the best things I think to come out of this

42:52.380 --> 42:56.820
particular conference was that KDE sent a few people.

42:56.820 --> 42:59.940
So it wasn't as Gnome-centric as the first iteration

42:59.940 --> 43:04.260
of the conference and I think for next year,

43:04.260 --> 43:06.020
there's going to be some rebranding

43:06.020 --> 43:09.620
and some sharing of resources and personnel

43:09.620 --> 43:13.460
so that next year, it's going to be more community-centric

43:13.460 --> 43:15.780
as opposed to Gnome-centric.

43:15.780 --> 43:20.780
So I know KDE's part of the reorganization plan

43:21.220 --> 43:22.060
for next year.

43:22.060 --> 43:25.780
They added a couple of people to the group, elementary.

43:25.780 --> 43:27.500
Daniel and Cassidy were both there.

43:27.500 --> 43:30.940
They are some amazing guys.

43:30.940 --> 43:32.980
I had a lot of fun getting to know them

43:32.980 --> 43:37.540
and talking to them and I think they both signed up

43:37.540 --> 43:42.540
to be part of the Libre Application Summit Committee.

43:43.020 --> 43:44.340
One of the things we're going to bring up

43:44.340 --> 43:48.500
is a rebrand and a rename, mostly because it's really

43:48.500 --> 43:52.340
confusing to people who are new to the community to,

43:52.340 --> 43:54.220
well, is this Linux Action Show?

43:54.220 --> 43:55.060
Is this like?

43:55.060 --> 43:56.460
Yeah, I was going to say, not to mention the acronym.

43:56.460 --> 44:00.500
Yeah, exactly, but so that's definitely

44:00.500 --> 44:02.540
on the plan for next year.

44:02.540 --> 44:06.780
We've got a bunch of folks from,

44:06.780 --> 44:09.100
let me see who I can name off the top of my head,

44:09.100 --> 44:14.100
from Spotify, from I think Nylas

44:14.420 --> 44:17.620
or the company behind MailSpring

44:17.620 --> 44:22.140
and I know a bunch of folks from Canonical want to come.

44:22.140 --> 44:23.460
It just didn't work out timing-wise.

44:23.460 --> 44:26.300
So I think next year, there'll be a slight shift

44:26.300 --> 44:28.100
in when this conference happens.

44:29.500 --> 44:34.500
That way more people can attend with expanding the,

44:35.740 --> 44:37.940
by expanding the committee that's planning the conference,

44:37.940 --> 44:40.820
we can get things planned and set up sooner.

44:40.820 --> 44:44.700
That way next year we can get more attention

44:44.700 --> 44:47.260
around this conference, we can get more people involved

44:47.260 --> 44:50.780
and try and present desktop Linux as a unified front

44:50.780 --> 44:55.260
instead of GNOME versus KDE versus LXDE.

44:55.260 --> 44:59.180
And it sounds like those seeds were laid in this one.

44:59.180 --> 45:00.140
So that's amazing.

45:00.140 --> 45:00.980
Very much so.

45:00.980 --> 45:04.340
And one of the, probably one of the best parts,

45:04.340 --> 45:05.980
one of the coolest things I got to see

45:05.980 --> 45:09.100
was there was, one of the days I was there,

45:09.100 --> 45:11.300
I was supporting my Jupiter broadcasting shirts

45:11.300 --> 45:13.060
and so some people recognized me

45:13.060 --> 45:16.380
from being in the mumble room on this show,

45:17.580 --> 45:21.900
but that's kind of a selfish take on that.

45:21.900 --> 45:23.940
But the best part was some of them

45:23.940 --> 45:25.780
were from the local colleges.

45:25.780 --> 45:28.300
They heard about the Libre Application Summit

45:28.300 --> 45:31.220
from the show and so they all pooled their money

45:31.220 --> 45:32.980
and they bought tickets and they all carpooled out.

45:32.980 --> 45:33.980
There was two different shows

45:33.980 --> 45:36.140
that they were in two different colleges.

45:36.140 --> 45:38.700
And they were some of the most involved

45:38.700 --> 45:39.820
in the Q&A sessions.

45:39.820 --> 45:44.820
They, a couple of them have a digital signage project

45:44.820 --> 45:47.660
that they're working on and I'll try

45:47.660 --> 45:48.820
and track that project down.

45:48.820 --> 45:51.860
I know I put it in the Ask Noah show telegram,

45:51.860 --> 45:53.500
but I'll track that project down.

45:53.500 --> 45:58.500
It was a neat idea to use Python and Raspberry Pis

45:59.420 --> 46:03.500
to have a central server that's sending out

46:03.500 --> 46:06.340
all the content from PDFs to MPVs

46:06.340 --> 46:08.620
out to Raspberry Pis across their campus.

46:08.620 --> 46:11.260
I think it's just their campus lab right now,

46:11.260 --> 46:14.020
but they've got some really cool ideas

46:14.020 --> 46:16.420
to spread their project across all of their campus

46:16.420 --> 46:18.780
and so they kind of announced that

46:18.780 --> 46:20.660
and some folks took some interest.

46:20.660 --> 46:25.660
And one of the schools, there was a couple of gentlemen

46:28.300 --> 46:33.020
that will be joining the engagement team for GNOME.

46:33.020 --> 46:36.540
So they're going to try and Sumner, thank you so much.

46:36.540 --> 46:37.740
It's actually in the IRC.

46:37.740 --> 46:40.860
It was the Colorado School of Mines called display

46:40.860 --> 46:44.980
was the name of the application that they're working on.

46:44.980 --> 46:48.900
And it was great to see college students getting involved

46:48.900 --> 46:51.220
and asking, okay, so how can I help spread the word

46:51.220 --> 46:55.340
around my campus and to my computer security club?

46:55.340 --> 46:59.420
And so it was great to see folks getting involved.

46:59.420 --> 47:00.980
And how much of it was technical then?

47:00.980 --> 47:03.660
Like what was the balance between technical talks

47:03.660 --> 47:07.020
and more kind of overview strategy stuff?

47:07.020 --> 47:09.620
The talks themselves were about 70, 30.

47:09.620 --> 47:12.260
A lot of it was pretty deep into the weeds.

47:12.260 --> 47:14.620
So as just a dumb systems engineer,

47:14.620 --> 47:16.780
I didn't quite understand all of it,

47:16.780 --> 47:21.140
but there was one of the talks,

47:21.140 --> 47:23.220
one gentleman from a company called Freehive

47:23.220 --> 47:25.740
has actually made me think of Brent

47:25.740 --> 47:28.780
because he is a graphic designer

47:28.780 --> 47:32.300
who got tired of being held hostage by Adobe

47:32.300 --> 47:36.900
and the creative suite and is rebranded,

47:36.900 --> 47:40.580
rebranded his entire company and went open source

47:40.580 --> 47:42.860
and said, it's a hard journey.

47:42.860 --> 47:47.580
His company is called Freehive, F-R-E-E-H-I-V-E.

47:47.580 --> 47:49.180
And he was a very dynamic speaker

47:49.180 --> 47:51.100
and he really brought some interesting attention

47:51.100 --> 47:54.460
to the developers and GNOME and KDE

47:54.460 --> 47:55.740
about the problems that are out there

47:55.740 --> 47:58.500
and some projects that could use some extra love.

47:58.500 --> 48:01.300
And I love how the IRC is throwing links in there.

48:01.300 --> 48:02.140
Thanks guys.

48:02.140 --> 48:03.540
That way I don't have to.

48:03.540 --> 48:04.940
Freehive.com.

48:04.940 --> 48:06.060
Yeah, I see myself in that.

48:06.060 --> 48:07.500
And we need more people doing that,

48:07.500 --> 48:08.780
especially in the creative space.

48:08.780 --> 48:10.580
So yeah, spread it around for sure.

48:10.580 --> 48:12.460
You definitely should reach out to Ryan

48:12.460 --> 48:14.980
the founder of Freehive.

48:14.980 --> 48:18.060
He was really, really great and very, very open.

48:18.060 --> 48:18.900
That's great.

48:18.900 --> 48:19.740
I certainly will.

48:19.740 --> 48:20.580
Thank you, thank you.

48:20.580 --> 48:21.420
Yeah.

48:21.420 --> 48:23.340
And in fact, that was one of the cool parts

48:23.340 --> 48:25.780
about being there and knowing people from GNOME

48:25.780 --> 48:28.060
and knowing people from elementary.

48:28.060 --> 48:29.860
Just as a lot of you know,

48:29.860 --> 48:32.340
I'm somewhat new to the open source community itself.

48:32.340 --> 48:34.420
I've been involved in Linux for seven years.

48:34.420 --> 48:36.860
I've been involved in running Linux on the desktop

48:36.860 --> 48:37.820
for about two and a half.

48:37.820 --> 48:39.100
But as far as the community goes,

48:39.100 --> 48:40.700
it's really been in the last few months.

48:40.700 --> 48:44.260
But within 15 minutes of the doors opening,

48:44.260 --> 48:46.140
I was able to talk to someone

48:46.140 --> 48:48.820
who was working on a way to monetize

48:48.820 --> 48:51.820
open source applications.

48:51.820 --> 48:55.580
And basically, I had just met Cassidy,

48:55.580 --> 48:57.220
not 10 minutes before.

48:57.220 --> 48:59.180
And so I was able to take this gentleman

48:59.180 --> 49:00.540
and go talk to Cassidy

49:00.540 --> 49:03.620
because they're doing that right now with elementary OS.

49:03.620 --> 49:05.380
So it was great to just be there

49:05.380 --> 49:07.940
and enable the community.

49:07.940 --> 49:10.340
And I've never tweeted so much in my life.

49:10.340 --> 49:11.460
Well, thank you for the summary.

49:11.460 --> 49:13.140
That does sound like fascinating.

49:13.140 --> 49:14.980
It sounds like it was a really good event for you to go to.

49:14.980 --> 49:16.380
And so I'm really glad you could make it.

49:16.380 --> 49:18.220
And how many people do you think

49:18.220 --> 49:20.860
if you're gonna take a wild guess were in attendance?

49:20.860 --> 49:23.180
I think we averaged about 40 people a day

49:23.180 --> 49:27.900
with probably 60 to 70 unique people.

49:27.900 --> 49:30.420
So there's some people that were only there for a day

49:30.420 --> 49:31.500
or two days.

49:31.500 --> 49:34.220
And then there's a few of us that were there every day.

49:34.220 --> 49:36.860
It sounds really quite intimate actually as an experience.

49:36.860 --> 49:38.580
I'm glad you went.

49:38.580 --> 49:41.660
It really was an intimate is definitely the right word

49:41.660 --> 49:46.660
to describe the technical exchange of ideas.

49:47.060 --> 49:51.780
We'll be doing some minor edits to all the sessions

49:51.780 --> 49:53.700
and those will be coming out over the next few weeks.

49:53.700 --> 49:57.140
But the talks were really the sideshow.

49:57.140 --> 49:59.180
It was the work that got done.

49:59.180 --> 50:00.980
It was the exchanging of ideas.

50:00.980 --> 50:04.180
It was the fact that Katie and Gnome,

50:04.180 --> 50:06.700
people could see firsthand were not competing,

50:06.700 --> 50:08.980
that they were just two groups of people

50:08.980 --> 50:11.140
that both have a passion for desktop Linux

50:11.140 --> 50:16.140
and that they're, I think in the months and years to come,

50:16.980 --> 50:18.500
we're going to see more collaboration

50:18.500 --> 50:19.500
between the two projects.

50:19.500 --> 50:21.220
I know what you're saying when you say

50:21.220 --> 50:22.860
you see the two projects working together.

50:22.860 --> 50:27.100
It's like the turf wars of the internet

50:27.100 --> 50:29.500
sort of just completely become irrelevant.

50:29.500 --> 50:31.500
And it's just two people trying to solve a problem

50:31.500 --> 50:32.900
working together in meat space.

50:32.900 --> 50:33.740
That's the best spirit.

50:33.740 --> 50:35.660
And we need both projects.

50:35.660 --> 50:39.500
Because for me, I can only speak for myself,

50:39.500 --> 50:42.620
but Plasma doesn't work well for my workflow.

50:42.620 --> 50:44.060
It brings back too many bad memories

50:44.060 --> 50:45.460
of all the years I ran Windows.

50:45.460 --> 50:49.620
But when I moved over from Mac OS,

50:49.620 --> 50:51.460
Gnome 3 just, it worked.

50:51.460 --> 50:53.780
It fit right into my workflow.

50:53.780 --> 50:55.860
So we need both projects.

50:55.860 --> 50:59.980
So the only people that would lose on a turf war like that

50:59.980 --> 51:02.140
is the entire community.

51:02.140 --> 51:04.020
Presumably there was quite a lot of hype

51:04.020 --> 51:06.140
about Gnome 3.30 then.

51:06.140 --> 51:07.700
Pretty good timing with the release of that

51:07.700 --> 51:08.780
just having happened.

51:08.780 --> 51:10.060
Yeah, that was pretty convenient.

51:10.060 --> 51:12.740
We had a release party and had cake

51:12.740 --> 51:15.580
and went to a retro arcade bar.

51:16.460 --> 51:19.140
So you could carry a drink around

51:19.140 --> 51:22.820
and play Galaga and Pac-Man and some others.

51:22.820 --> 51:26.460
But it was a really convenient timing.

51:27.620 --> 51:32.540
And having played with 3.30,

51:32.540 --> 51:35.460
I wish I could, I was planning on coming on today

51:35.460 --> 51:36.700
and just being all excited,

51:36.700 --> 51:37.780
and you've gotta try this out.

51:37.780 --> 51:42.780
But as Wes kind of alluded to the other day,

51:42.940 --> 51:45.260
it's just another good release.

51:45.260 --> 51:46.700
There's a bunch of bug fixes.

51:46.700 --> 51:49.460
There is a new podcast app,

51:49.460 --> 51:50.900
which I'm looking forward to trying.

51:50.900 --> 51:54.740
But it's a lot of good work.

51:54.740 --> 51:56.180
It was hundreds of commits.

51:56.180 --> 51:57.980
It was hundreds of people working on it.

51:57.980 --> 52:01.540
And all in all, it's a great accomplishment.

52:01.540 --> 52:04.700
I'm missing my Arch install right now

52:04.700 --> 52:07.980
because I'm not running it on my main workstation.

52:07.980 --> 52:09.060
So if you're running Fedora,

52:09.060 --> 52:11.460
that should come out in Fedora 29,

52:11.460 --> 52:13.500
which is slated for the end of next month.

52:13.500 --> 52:17.780
So I'm debating putting my main system

52:17.780 --> 52:19.660
onto the testing repos

52:19.660 --> 52:21.860
just because I really wanna run it.

52:21.860 --> 52:22.820
Thanks.

52:22.820 --> 52:24.180
Yeah, I understand that drive.

52:24.180 --> 52:26.740
That is the spot I've been in.

52:26.740 --> 52:29.460
I have, as part of joining Linux Academy,

52:29.460 --> 52:31.340
I have a work machine coming to me.

52:31.340 --> 52:32.620
And Wes does as well.

52:32.620 --> 52:35.580
And we got, is Poppy still here?

52:35.580 --> 52:36.420
Yeah, Neon Poppy.

52:36.420 --> 52:37.260
We got ThinkPads.

52:37.260 --> 52:38.100
We got ThinkPads.

52:38.100 --> 52:38.940
Indeed.

52:38.940 --> 52:40.380
So very excited.

52:40.380 --> 52:41.860
We have ThinkPads that are gonna,

52:41.860 --> 52:43.380
they're actually being shipped to us.

52:43.380 --> 52:45.060
So they'll be here probably in a week.

52:45.060 --> 52:48.220
And I think I'm gonna put Neon on it.

52:48.220 --> 52:49.180
Oh, Neon.

52:49.180 --> 52:50.020
Okay, yeah.

52:50.020 --> 52:50.860
That makes sense.

52:50.860 --> 52:52.820
I should do Kubuntu because we're doing Kubuntu

52:52.820 --> 52:55.060
on all of the production systems.

52:55.060 --> 52:58.700
But I'd love an 1804 base.

52:58.700 --> 53:01.300
And I'd love the fresh plasma.

53:01.300 --> 53:04.620
And so I was kind of gonna ask you,

53:04.620 --> 53:06.980
like how is, what do I, is there an ISO?

53:06.980 --> 53:09.500
Can I just go right to the 1804 version of Neon

53:09.500 --> 53:10.380
when that machine arrives?

53:10.380 --> 53:13.660
Like all my Neon boxes are still 1604 based.

53:13.660 --> 53:16.460
The Neon 1804 is a preview version.

53:16.460 --> 53:18.220
So it's still in like, it's in beta now.

53:18.220 --> 53:20.620
So it's close to being released,

53:20.620 --> 53:23.220
but there's still at least a couple of weeks or so.

53:23.220 --> 53:24.260
Do you think it's safe?

53:24.260 --> 53:25.500
I mean, do you think it's,

53:25.500 --> 53:27.820
I feel like it's probably gotta be getting there, right?

53:27.820 --> 53:30.980
Well, the problem is that there's going to be bugs

53:30.980 --> 53:33.980
until they finish the migration between 1604 and 1804.

53:33.980 --> 53:36.620
So they don't really know.

53:36.620 --> 53:39.020
I would, it depends on what you're doing it for.

53:39.020 --> 53:40.620
Just really want fresh plasma.

53:40.620 --> 53:43.940
If it's not for the potential of, you know,

53:43.940 --> 53:46.420
catastrophic if you lose some stuff,

53:46.420 --> 53:48.540
then I would, you know, it's fine.

53:48.540 --> 53:50.380
Yeah, I don't think it'd be catastrophic.

53:50.380 --> 53:51.580
Yeah, if you're not storing everything,

53:51.580 --> 53:53.860
cause if you're doing stuff on the production machines

53:53.860 --> 53:56.660
or on the stable release of a Kubuntu,

53:56.660 --> 53:58.140
you should be fine if you're, if you like,

53:58.140 --> 53:59.940
if you don't store a bunch of stuff on there.

53:59.940 --> 54:01.100
I don't think it would break things,

54:01.100 --> 54:03.820
but there's some times where I had Kwin crash a few times

54:03.820 --> 54:06.740
and there's a couple of times where I had Kwin

54:06.740 --> 54:10.220
just pretty much just obliterate itself

54:10.220 --> 54:12.820
and not think it existed

54:12.820 --> 54:14.140
so that system wouldn't even boot.

54:14.140 --> 54:16.140
Like I can get in TTY, but that was about it.

54:16.140 --> 54:18.340
We had that same problem in the studio happened once.

54:18.340 --> 54:20.280
Now, so I'm thinking like in a month though,

54:20.280 --> 54:21.620
the laptop is going to maybe,

54:21.620 --> 54:23.700
well, I guess actually more than a couple of months.

54:23.700 --> 54:26.160
I'm sort of, I'm sort of grounded for a few months,

54:26.160 --> 54:28.960
but eventually it'll be in my travel broadcast machine.

54:28.960 --> 54:30.580
So I do want it to be pretty rock solid,

54:30.580 --> 54:34.380
but I probably have a few months before it's necessary.

54:34.380 --> 54:36.940
So you need a rock solid distro on that laptop, right?

54:36.940 --> 54:40.780
And you're thinking about possibly Neon or maybe Kubuntu.

54:40.780 --> 54:42.060
Well, Chris, come on.

54:42.060 --> 55:01.060
There's only one distro that you could put on that, Solus.
