1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
How are you guys feeling about the deck?

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,640
I'm sure you've been watching the reviews.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,140
How are you feeling at this point?

4
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,980
I'd say fairly positive.

5
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,180
I mean, it's not like it was 100% blown everyone

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,840
out of the water success, but considering

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,080
how early we are in the journey, at least

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,120
if some of the rumors about potential future plans

9
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,480
are to be believed, seems like it's going pretty well.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,560
Yeah.

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,160
I feel like my angle where I could just potentially use it

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,840
as a portable podcast rig for travel

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,960
that fits in a backpack that doubles as a machine

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,960
to play games on occasionally, I feel like that is

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,760
looking good for me right now.

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,680
That's probably going to play out pretty well.

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,480
But they haven't released the actual OS image

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,960
to run on a desktop yet.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,660
And that's really, I think, when I get my hands on that,

20
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,280
I'm going to have a much sounder,

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,280
kind of deeper understanding if I'm actually

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,800
going to be able to use that thing as a daily driver.

23
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
Come on, we want to play.

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,960
The recovery image came out.

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,240
You see that?

26
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,240
Oh, no, I missed that.

27
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,640
It's kind of funny, actually.

28
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,100
If you download the recovery image

29
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,560
and you manage to get it up and going in a VM,

30
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,760
and I've got some tips linked in the show notes,

31
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,040
when it first boots, it's sideways,

32
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,080
like the deck would be.

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,600
So it boots from the right side of your screen to the left.

34
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,880
That's some attention to detail right there.

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,200
There's a fix, though, for that as well.

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,040
But this is just the recovery OS.

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,400
This is not Steam OS.

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,800
I'm not going to base my decisions and my opinions

39
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,100
off this, but I'm watching it.

40
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,160
It's pretty fun.

41
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,920
I love seeing this stuff slowly come out.

42
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,320
And you've got to figure, like, Valve probably

43
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,080
saw tens of thousands of more downloads

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,000
of the OS recovery image, and they've actually

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,300
shipped of decks at this point.

46
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:31,800
No kidding.

47
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,280
Ha, ha, ha.

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:44,720
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,560
My name is Chris.

50
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
My name is Wes.

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,640
And my name is Brent.

52
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,480
Hey, guys, coming up on the show this week, well,

53
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,640
I actually have no idea.

54
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,480
We have three topics, and I have no idea

55
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,900
what these guys want to talk about.

56
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,940
So to be specific, I know my topic, but each of us

57
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,960
has a secret that we've brought to the show today.

58
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,560
And we have no idea what those are,

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,200
because we have encrypted our show notes

60
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,120
to prevent each other from discovering what

61
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,920
we want to talk about today.

62
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,880
So we're going to sit back and just chat

63
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,600
about whatever the three of us would like to talk about.

64
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,040
Doesn't even necessarily have to be Linux specific, I suppose.

65
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,280
And then we'll wrap it up and round it all up

66
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,160
with some boosts and picks and more.

67
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,840
But before we go any further, it's

68
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,560
time to say hello to our virtual lug.

69
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,400
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

70
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,080
Hello, Chris.

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,840
Hello, Wes.

72
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,720
Hello, Brent.

73
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,520
Hello.

74
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,120
Hello.

75
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
16 of them in there.

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,400
Not our biggest showing, but a decent showing.

77
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,480
Nice to have them there.

78
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,280
And always available to anyone.

79
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,280
More details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

80
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,880
So before we get into the topics,

81
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,240
and I know it's going to be a lot, so we want to make room.

82
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,200
I have no idea how long, but I assume

83
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,240
because of the length of these notes,

84
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,840
it's going to take us a bit.

85
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,840
So I want to mention, just remind everyone,

86
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,800
that we are planning finally.

87
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,880
It's been way too long.

88
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,320
I think it's really been since Ohio Linux Fest.

89
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,080
We have an East Coast Jupiter broadcasting meetup coming up.

90
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,400
They said it couldn't be done.

91
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,960
That's right.

92
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,800
But they were wrong.

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,160
Now, are you sure you're still thinking about going?

94
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,840
Yeah, I was just trying to work through some of that planning

95
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,760
earlier this week.

96
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,000
I know both of you and I have to figure out doggy care.

97
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,800
Yep, dog care, life plans.

98
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,440
I booked my flights, though, because I'm a cheapskate,

99
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,600
and so I wanted to get one that was cheap as possible.

100
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,560
Yeah, you should.

101
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,800
Excellent news.

102
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,200
But oh, man, you should go.

103
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,840
Throw a little party.

104
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,440
I'm just saying, if you had a special occasion that weekend,

105
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,200
it'd also be a good way for you to spend that special occasion.

106
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,880
It's true.

107
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,640
If you had such a special occasion

108
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,240
that I wouldn't want to mention on air for security reasons.

109
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,440
But anyways, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting,

110
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,160
that's where you go to sign up.

111
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,520
Yesterday, I think, Alex went there and confirmed.

112
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,040
Oh, a scout out, nice.

113
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,520
I was like, this sounds too good to be true.

114
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,680
But it is true.

115
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
There is a barbecue joint that could easily

116
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,880
handle like 30 people.

117
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,840
We're going to try to get an idea from the meetup

118
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,120
and give them a heads up.

119
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,960
But it's a big joint.

120
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,200
And on the other end of the park,

121
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,840
where I think we'll hang out in the park,

122
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,120
and on the other end of the park,

123
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,720
he confirmed it with pictures, there is indeed a brewery.

124
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,080
Amazing, what a good find.

125
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,600
So, so awesome.

126
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,720
It's all coming together.

127
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,760
We're also going to bring some snacks,

128
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
so there'll be some snacks there.

129
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,000
And it's going to happen at 3 PM Eastern time.

130
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,520
The meetup is in Pacific time, but that's just because that's,

131
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,240
I guess, how meetup.com runs it.

132
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,600
Listen, date times are hard, and programmers hate them.

133
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,760
As long as we've been using meetup,

134
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,140
we've always struggled with this.

135
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,360
It's like, why not set the time based

136
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,560
on the location of the event?

137
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,300
But they don't, I guess, expect you to be throwing

138
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,520
events in other time zones.

139
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,040
Yeah, we're not like the normal folks.

140
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,920
Anyways, we've got about 24 people, including

141
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,200
ourselves so far, going.

142
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,720
But I'd love to see as many that could make it,

143
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,160
because we don't make it out there very often.

144
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,600
So again, it'll be in Raleigh, North Carolina,

145
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,680
on Saturday, April 9 at 3 PM.

146
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,600
And we have details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

147
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,760
I think it's like the Nightdale station run.

148
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,520
There's a park there.

149
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,320
There's a barbecue joint.

150
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
If you know the area, we'd love to see you there,

151
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,880
because it's going to be a blast.

152
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,560
And then from the category of how amazing is our audience,

153
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,160
I got an email from listener Cole.

154
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,640
He says, a longtime listener here.

155
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,080
We've met many times at Linux Fest Northwest

156
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,720
in episode 444.

157
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,480
You were talking about some RV problems.

158
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,480
I am an electrician with 20 years of experience

159
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,120
in the building trades in Seattle.

160
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,280
I'd be happy to help any way I can.

161
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,640
And so I reached out to Cole.

162
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,140
Wow.

163
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,040
And Cole's coming up next Saturday

164
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,080
to hang out with Hadi and I at JOOPS.

165
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,960
That's amazing.

166
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,160
Because he said he wanted to see the power system.

167
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,920
So we're going to show him the power system.

168
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,080
I'm going to show him the wiring that's still not working

169
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,520
that we've kind of patched around.

170
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
Oh, for your slide.

171
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
And see if maybe he has any ideas for that.

172
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,440
I know it's a simple job, but it's just

173
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,720
we tried patching it up, and it's still not working.

174
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,320
But I am trying to get a road trip ready.

175
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,680
So this is going to be a big help.

176
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,280
And there's a really great walk-up diner.

177
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,920
I don't know if that's what you call it,

178
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,280
but there's like a walk-up diner 10 minutes

179
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,800
from where we're parked.

180
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,960
I thought maybe we'd go in and get a little lunch.

181
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,880
Cole's about to find out.

182
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,520
Yeah, he is.

183
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,600
Oh, it's going to be great.

184
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,680
Our audience, they have so many amazing skills.

185
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,280
Yeah, they do.

186
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,040
It's so great.

187
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,320
It's just, man, you're sitting there.

188
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,480
And some people are behind, but they're like,

189
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,600
oh, I'm going to give it a shot anyways.

190
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,040
I'll reach out.

191
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,560
And I know I'm about a month late, but I'll try.

192
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,680
Turns out you still have problems.

193
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,920
They sure do, Wes.

194
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,800
I do.

195
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,680
They're better.

196
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,600
But Wes, I still definitely have problems.

197
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,240
All right, so we're going to break this up,

198
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,720
and we're each going to present our topic this week.

199
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,120
And I think I'll go last, just in case they go long,

200
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,400
because I can make mine as short or long as I need.

201
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,800
Only because you know what it is.

202
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,160
Yeah, that's true.

203
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,680
That's true.

204
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,280
So we'll start with Brent, and I'll

205
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,480
begin the decryption process.

206
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:58,160
Now, to make sure that Wes and I had

207
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,000
no idea what Brent was going to talk about,

208
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,160
he did all of his show notes in the language of love

209
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,080
this week.

210
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,480
What do you have for us, Mr. Brent?

211
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,520
Well, I did write my show notes en Francais.

212
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,520
And I also threw in a few little social decoys.

213
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,040
So I'm just curious, do either of you

214
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,960
have any idea what I'm about to talk about?

215
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,680
Decoys, really?

216
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,400
I love this.

217
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,320
You're trying to throw us off your smell.

218
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,400
I see what you're doing here.

219
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,880
OK, so a quick scan of a I'm not trying to read it,

220
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,000
but I'm trying to read it is I see something

221
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,880
about voter method technique, and then I also

222
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,380
see something about a DMG to image file.

223
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,960
So those are separate things.

224
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,080
I don't know how they relate.

225
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm looking at the commands.

226
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,640
I see HFS plus in here.

227
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,960
Oh, yeah, what's going on there?

228
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,000
So I'm feeling like maybe this is something

229
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,480
about converting a DMG, but I don't know, because.

230
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,200
Or is it a trap for Mac users?

231
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,760
Right.

232
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,240
Oh, yeah, it's very mysterious, Brent.

233
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,880
It sounds like you have no idea, which I'm totally fine with.

234
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,480
No, it sounds like we're way off.

235
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,920
Are we way off?

236
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,440
You have little tiny hints, and that's

237
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,600
what I wanted this to be was kind of interesting.

238
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,440
I wanted to give you guys little tiny hints,

239
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,160
but they'd be so not obvious that you actually have zero idea.

240
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
OK, I got another.

241
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,560
OK, the other thing I'm noticing in here

242
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,320
is that our app get installing CD to ISO,

243
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,200
and you're likely converting something

244
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,400
that was old to a new image standard,

245
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,360
so that way you can access it in a machine that needs it

246
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,080
as an ISO file for some reason.

247
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,800
Yeah, you do have a link here that has some dates,

248
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,360
like 2005, something Brent, 2007.

249
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,920
So old media would make sense.

250
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,160
Yeah, yeah, all right.

251
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,040
You guys have only dug down to layer one.

252
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,280
That's great.

253
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
But I was thinking about this kind of interestingly,

254
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,940
because when we came up with this concept,

255
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,440
I thought, OK, I'm going to write mine in French,

256
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
because that seemed to work last time.

257
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,640
Everybody sort of loved that, and you guys,

258
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,120
as far as I understand, don't understand French that well,

259
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
despite it being pretty close to English.

260
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,680
And then it got me thinking, any language you don't know

261
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,840
is a form of encryption, because it may look kind

262
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,600
of seemingly familiar, and yet you can't figure it out.

263
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,160
But I didn't want it to be too easy,

264
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,720
because you could just go and convert that in Google

265
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
Translate or something.

266
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,220
So glad you guys didn't do that, and thanks for not breaking

267
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,520
my encryption so easily.

268
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,260
We have, I mean, we're somewhat comfortable with the honor

269
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,700
system.

270
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,440
So my topic, I think, is each of us

271
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,940
will have something to say about it.

272
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,960
So Chris, I think I'll go with you first, and so here we go.

273
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,520
So I would like to know, each of you, how you manage,

274
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,840
or if you even have a way of managing a knowledge

275
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,720
base, a personal knowledge base.

276
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,520
So this is a topic that's dear to me

277
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,360
and that I have found extremely useful,

278
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,120
and there are a few technologies that I'll mention

279
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,920
once you guys are done that I use.

280
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,460
But I'm curious, for information that you

281
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,960
learn on a daily basis, which is how it is for me,

282
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,160
how do you record that stuff?

283
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,320
Where do you record it?

284
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,520
Has that been working for you?

285
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,880
How have you done in the past?

286
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,360
Boy, what a great question.

287
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,080
What a great question, and I will actually

288
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,200
be touching on this a little bit today.

289
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,400
But I will say this, it depends on the context.

290
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,980
I feel like there's institutional knowledge

291
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,800
about how things work in JB that need

292
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,920
to be captured in one way.

293
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,240
Then there's knowledge about how my server set up

294
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,900
in my LadyJuice RV, how that's built and interconnected.

295
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,640
That's another type of knowledge that needs to be captured.

296
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,320
And then there's the family records, medical records,

297
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
maintenance records for your vehicles, and all of that.

298
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,320
And each one of them, I've kind of

299
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
stumbled into different solutions.

300
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,880
And I mean, I don't love that, to be honest with you.

301
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
And some of it's because maybe I started tracking

302
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,360
this particular thing 15 years ago.

303
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,980
And this next thing I started tracking,

304
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,360
I started tracking two years ago.

305
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,340
So I'm using something more modern.

306
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,780
So I have a bit of a range depending on the topic.

307
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,360
It's a bit of a hot mess.

308
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,560
I fantasize about having one central knowledge

309
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,600
base of all things, but I also don't want to manage that.

310
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,360
Yeah, that was sort of my approach as well.

311
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,220
But I feel like you mentioned a bunch

312
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,920
of different types of sensitivities of information.

313
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,680
Some of it you want to share.

314
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,520
Others, it's deeply personal, and you

315
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,720
should keep somewhere that nobody has their hands on.

316
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,680
So that's where my curiosity came in

317
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,920
is I feel like shortcuts to the things we learn

318
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,080
are deeply personal.

319
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,340
I have a giant folder of notes that are specific to technology.

320
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,480
And someone else who might look at it

321
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,240
might have no idea what it actually

322
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,440
is because they're all just shortcuts to spaces in my mind.

323
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,700
They're like reminders of there might be a command there.

324
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,120
And if you don't understand what it is,

325
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,620
then you have no idea what it does.

326
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,960
But through decades of learning about R Sync, for instance,

327
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,800
I've memorized most of the flags that I use on a regular basis.

328
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
But sometimes you just need a quick little, you know,

329
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,560
you need to be able to get there really quickly.

330
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,880
So, Chris, do you have access to this stuff on your phone

331
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,040
or only when you're at home?

332
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,440
Or is there a favorite platform that you're using right now

333
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,840
that you're really excited about?

334
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,680
This is where Tailscale changed it for me.

335
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,240
Because with Nebula, I had connected my servers.

336
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,880
But with Tailscale, I've connected

337
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,220
all of my front-end systems.

338
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,720
And then all of a sudden, the stuff

339
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,640
that was the domain of Lady Joops

340
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,560
and only lived in Lady Joops now existed

341
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,400
on this private mesh land that I have.

342
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,440
And that all of a sudden opened up all of access

343
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,240
to all of that stuff that I had stored there.

344
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,760
So now I do have access to all of it.

345
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,840
But my most common high-level way to collect information

346
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,320
is I generally attempt to just store the link where

347
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,720
I found that information and archived if possible.

348
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,440
So I've used a lot of different tools,

349
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,880
like WallBag and Pinboard and Deego and, geez,

350
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,040
probably ones I'm not even remembering at the moment.

351
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,080
There's different eras of those kinds of tools.

352
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,920
For sure, right?

353
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,000
And so a lot of times, I have, like,

354
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,560
say something with WallBag or Pinboard, I will tag it.

355
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,300
I'll tag it with a show, a topic, a project that's

356
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,000
mentioned in there.

357
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,080
And then I can go back and filter on those tags later

358
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,880
and find the links.

359
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,520
And then we've even gone as far as generating

360
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,200
bots that ingest the feeds and these tags

361
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,840
and then put them into different discussion groups that

362
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,480
are relevant to those shows.

363
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,380
And so that was sort of the next step,

364
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,920
is then exposing that information

365
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,320
to the appropriate place once I've ingested it

366
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,480
so it doesn't just get out of sight, out of mind.

367
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,960
It sounds like a nice level of sophistication, actually.

368
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,400
Wes, I'm curious about you.

369
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,560
Yeah, you know, I've also kind of dabbled with various tools.

370
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,600
And I've had a few different wikis that I've run for myself

371
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,480
and also kind of kept, like, some of the open source

372
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,560
Kanban board systems.

373
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,720
So far, Markdown files and plain text

374
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,360
has been mostly what I've stuck with.

375
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,520
I think because I don't actually, at the moment,

376
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,080
have that much, I'm not really cataloging or using

377
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,800
the interrelationships of data very much.

378
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,560
A lot of the things that I tend to have

379
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,520
will be focused on a particular domain and then have examples.

380
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,760
Or, yeah, Chris, you've said some archive of links

381
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,360
and sort of, like, here's some references

382
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,040
if you want to go dive back into this topic.

383
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,600
And here's an example of what you were playing

384
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,040
with last time you were here.

385
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,400
Right now, I don't care that much

386
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,920
about going to find my own notes from that beyond what

387
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,520
Grep is doing.

388
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,840
I know that there's a lot of tools for that.

389
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,760
I just didn't find myself really taking advantage of it.

390
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,000
Right.

391
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,800
Sometimes if you just see the source again.

392
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,280
OK.

393
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,160
Yeah, yeah.

394
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,520
What about?

395
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,760
It's not great, though, and it's not fancy.

396
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,680
And to your guys' point, I don't have a way.

397
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,800
I've thought about doing it.

398
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,200
I just kind of haven't of, like, capturing that stuff on the go.

399
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,360
So I just have ways of sending myself notes for later anyway

400
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:36,680
that I just integrate.

401
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,360
What about dollar sign day job where

402
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,000
you're, like, developing maybe a piece of code

403
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
or solving a problem?

404
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,840
Do you have anything to store?

405
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,120
Like, do you ever go back and, like, oh, I

406
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,320
know I solved this problem a couple of years ago

407
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,960
and have something tucked away?

408
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, I mean, that's a similar kind of thing, right?

409
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,640
Various scripts and sources on the same stuff.

410
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,760
But it's mostly just files with, you know,

411
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,800
there's, like, a little bit of folder structure.

412
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,640
Are you more likely to just write the solution again

413
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,320
from scratch with modern skills than go back and grab it

414
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
and just re-implement?

415
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,520
I think it depends, you know?

416
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,640
I find that, yes, it will probably

417
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,480
need a little bit of diving back in anyway.

418
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,440
So it's sort of like, how much do I capture

419
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,880
and how much do I provide ways of getting back

420
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,760
to where that knowledge, you know, where?

421
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,400
Because sometimes the difficulty is not necessarily

422
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,880
understanding.

423
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,960
It was just, like, how did I find the details of, you know,

424
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,920
where the inner workings of X thing was?

425
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,840
And so if you can capture a little bit of that,

426
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,320
like, here's how I used it, or here's

427
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,680
where those API docs are actually stored,

428
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,480
that's, like, all the jump back that you need.

429
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,160
But that depends, like, that's the frequency with which you

430
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,720
access it and plan to access it is a huge factor in all

431
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,120
of that, right?

432
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,640
True.

433
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,840
That sounds very similar, though, to how I operate,

434
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,560
very much how I kind of think about it.

435
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,460
And then I do have, for, like, bookmarks and stuff there,

436
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,800
I have more of a tagged system.

437
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,040
I've thought about having more, you know,

438
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,880
tags or other things more widely used,

439
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,840
but right now it's a bit of a minimalist system.

440
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,920
I'll be quite upfront about that.

441
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,720
I ebb and flow.

442
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,080
Like, sometimes it's minimal tags,

443
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,440
and sometimes, like, all the metadata.

444
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,480
See, I lean a little bit towards Wes's approach,

445
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,920
and I'll give you a sense of why in a second here.

446
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,200
So for me, I've landed on Nextcloud a few years ago,

447
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,520
actually, and just marked down text files for most of it.

448
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,560
You know, not everything can be captured that way,

449
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,040
but that has been an amazingly simple solution for me,

450
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,360
and with a problem I struggle with for years before that.

451
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,200
And I think the main reason is for future proofing.

452
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,800
Like, Chris, I know you're using some fancier technologies

453
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,600
than maybe some marked down text files,

454
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,400
and there's some people in the chat room who

455
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,000
I'll bring in in a sec who are also

456
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,880
using some pretty cool stuff.

457
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,720
But I worry about, you know, the maintenance that goes into that,

458
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,600
and, you know, in five years, is that stuff still

459
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,480
going to be accessible?

460
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,760
That's something I worry about.

461
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:43,920
Yeah.

462
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,300
Do you have a way to export it?

463
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,880
Even then, are you going to then convert it or hope

464
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,280
that whatever your next tool is supports importing from that,

465
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,800
or there's some middle ground format you have access to,

466
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,960
which is then maybe some kind of just plain or plainish text?

467
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,240
And there's another big constraint for me as well,

468
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,720
but I think I'll probably touch on that during my topic

469
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,600
as a hint.

470
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Do-do-do-do.

471
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,960
Ooh.

472
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,840
In the chat room, Casey, can you talk a little bit

473
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,840
about what you're doing?

474
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,340
Yeah.

475
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,240
I've been using an open source app called Trillium

476
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,640
for about a year and a half now.

477
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,320
It just hit version 0.5.

478
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
So I highly recommend folks go check it out

479
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,020
if they checked it out before and it wasn't

480
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,440
quite mature enough for them.

481
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,680
I think it has a lot of the points

482
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,400
that you guys have been mentioning here.

483
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,920
So for starters, it does have markdown kind of support

484
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
when you're editing.

485
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,080
It's a rich text editor that uses markdown to indicate,

486
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,520
hey, you put a hashtag, that means that's a header,

487
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,080
or stars turn into bullets, things like that.

488
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,000
But I think that probably a little more on the nose of it,

489
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,720
it does have a self-hosted component to it.

490
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,720
So you can have a Trillium server

491
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,000
that you put in a Docker Compose config.

492
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,960
That's what I do.

493
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,200
You put it behind whatever security

494
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,280
you want to put it behind.

495
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,120
It has its own password system, but you can also,

496
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,000
I have it set up so I have to actually wire guard

497
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,400
into the network that I'm posting it on.

498
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,240
And then from there, it has desktop, well,

499
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,480
Electron apps or web browser interfaces to it

500
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,280
that you can use to sync your notes

501
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,080
from an offline copy of it to this centralized server.

502
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,760
So it's sort of a start topology.

503
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,880
And then what I think is really cool

504
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,640
is because it does have the support

505
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
for this centralized server, you get

506
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,000
a lot of really cool ways to get data into it.

507
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,200
So for instance, there's a browser extension

508
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,440
that you can just one click go when you have a page open,

509
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,040
and it will save a copy of the page in your journal

510
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,160
under that day that is fully searchable.

511
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,640
It's all in a SQL database.

512
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,280
And then you can just dump that SQL database

513
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,280
if you want to back it up, or it saves

514
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,440
in a particular directory.

515
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,480
So I just back up that whole directory on NextCloud.

516
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,400
But on top of that, I think it's really cool

517
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,600
because of the fact that, Wes, you

518
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,200
said you hadn't really talked about the interrelationship

519
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,520
between notes.

520
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,680
This has first class support for linking

521
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,840
between notes, which is always like, OK, that's table stakes.

522
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,480
But you can add metadata properties to your notes.

523
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,800
So I actually have on my journal both a weight tracker

524
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,080
so I can keep track of how I'm gaining and losing weight

525
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,040
over time.

526
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,800
And I just punch in the number via my cell phone

527
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,920
browser each morning.

528
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,240
And then I can go back and scrape that data later

529
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,360
to get a nice little line chart of how I've been

530
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,640
doing over the last few months.

531
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,280
All right.

532
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,000
All right.

533
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,640
You know what?

534
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm going to check this out after the show.

535
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,560
You're kind of speaking my language here.

536
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,840
It does sound very cool.

537
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,040
It's really awesome.

538
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,560
It's still kind of new.

539
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,240
We're still only at 0.50.

540
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,880
But like, oh, man.

541
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,680
I'm really proud of how things have

542
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,720
been going on this project.

543
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,040
And I contribute both financially and technically.

544
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,680
So I'm always happy to speak to how cool Trillium is.

545
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,680
Takes a little bit to set up and get used to.

546
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,520
But once you get into the groove of it,

547
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,820
that's something that's going to stick with me for years

548
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,320
to come.

549
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,520
Yeah, I'm liking you're just entering information

550
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,720
in on the phone as you go.

551
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,920
So Trillium, we'll have a link to that in the show notes

552
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,540
if people listening want to check it out.

553
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,680
That's very cool.

554
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,260
I wanted to touch back on some of my show notes,

555
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,040
gentlemen, because you mentioned them.

556
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,480
There is a command that I ran there,

557
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,800
nice little find command that told me what the oldest

558
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,840
note is in my notes folder.

559
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,560
And so it looks like 2010 is the oldest modification

560
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,520
time from what I can gauge.

561
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,160
But the first time I really started building this knowledge

562
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,840
base was way back in 2007, I think, on a Palm Z22.

563
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,800
I don't know if anyone had a Palm device.

564
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,640
Chris, you might have had some.

565
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,080
Well, I actually never owned one,

566
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,680
but I definitely was responsible for fixing them.

567
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,800
That I definitely did.

568
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,560
I would have definitely taken it as someone

569
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,320
who would have grabbed it up right away.

570
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,280
They were super useful.

571
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,920
I dabbled.

572
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,760
Dabbling.

573
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,260
Yeah, I definitely dabbled.

574
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,960
And so this was a relatively simple device back then.

575
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,880
And it just took notes and kept track of contacts and things

576
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
like that, the things that we take for granted, I think,

577
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,000
these days on our phones.

578
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,760
But that was a total change, a shift in paradigm for me.

579
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,320
And I just have been endlessly curious and gathering

580
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,560
information ever since.

581
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,440
Yeah, I should have mentioned, I also

582
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,180
keep paper notes, which these are not the notes I

583
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,160
expect to capture forever.

584
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,480
But I really don't like it when I end up using the platform's

585
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,760
note system.

586
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:28,200
And I have ended up using Google Keep or Apple Notes.

587
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,680
It's just a quick note, Chris.

588
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,080
So that's definitely something I'm going to work on.

589
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,600
Trillium sounds like it has some real potential

590
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,000
over the long term there.

591
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,480
Yeah, Brent, I've watched you take notes, too, with paper.

592
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,280
I know just pen and paper can be a way you'll capture thoughts,

593
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,780
too.

594
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,960
Do you back those up later?

595
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,480
Do you save those notebooks?

596
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,640
Do you capture that?

597
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,120
I think you probably see me doing that mostly for show prep.

598
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,880
I have clearly decided that trying

599
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,300
to grab stuff outside of Linux Unplugged,

600
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,180
but trying to grab stuff for real deep person-to-person

601
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,920
conversation is just better on paper.

602
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,000
And I know you've dabbled with that a little bit.

603
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,620
But anytime I'm doing a brunch interview or a one-on-one

604
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,200
with someone, I find just spending five minutes

605
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,160
and writing things down, there's something

606
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,560
that happens where I hardly refer to those notes

607
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,040
because the process of writing them down just kind of

608
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,360
solidifies them in my mind.

609
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,440
And the thing that I think you'll

610
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,020
appreciate that I most enjoy about that

611
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,120
is that because it's in my mind in a slightly more

612
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,520
permanent way in that moment, I could then

613
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,240
be very creative on the spot about the layout

614
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,040
of those topics as the conversation's flowing.

615
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,920
Whereas on paper or notes, I find that a little bit

616
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:49,200
more difficult. So I'll often, as the conversation is going,

617
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,080
just kind of like scratch notes out or add extra ideas

618
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,560
as the conversation's happening.

619
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,800
But I certainly do keep all those notebooks.

620
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,240
There's one actually right in front of me.

621
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,040
I'm looking at it.

622
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,240
And it's every brunch conversation

623
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,000
I've had in one notebook.

624
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,680
And there's another one just next to my desk

625
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,440
here that's a bunch of scribbles about when we were at the studio

626
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,480
last doing a bunch of projects and just

627
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,820
some creative fumbling around with paper

628
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,320
and sketching out the server cabinet that we made.

629
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,920
And so I think there is a place for both digital notes you

630
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,560
want to keep for a while and paper notes that are

631
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,460
more just a creative process.

632
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,400
I do envision saving some of those,

633
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,600
but I never get around to it.

634
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,720
So there you go.

635
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,880
Yeah, there is something about thinking on paper that's slower.

636
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,560
It sort of absorbs into you as you have painstakingly

637
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,360
go along and capture all of it.

638
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,400
I can't quite understand why I could type a note

639
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,200
and forget it in 10 seconds.

640
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,520
And if I write that same exact note down,

641
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,000
I may remember it forever.

642
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,600
It's so weird.

643
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,240
Maybe it's because I do one thing all the time,

644
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,720
and I comparatively do the other thing rarely.

645
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,560
I feel like maybe that's a feature as well.

646
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,440
If you're typing something in a digital note,

647
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,600
the whole point is for you to be able to forget it

648
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,680
until you need it again.

649
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,400
So I don't know.

650
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,540
Different space for different type of ideas, perhaps.

651
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,240
Oh, I think shout out to OneNote.

652
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,840
I think we should get the OneNote story in the post-show

653
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,160
because I think that's a post-show topic.

654
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,200
If you're asking me.

655
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,040
Not quite on topic.

656
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:25,040
So gentlemen, you skipped right over a honeypot I left for you.

657
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,400
I left a little doom on the Z22 link for you,

658
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,840
and you guys didn't even mention it.

659
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,720
I'm surprised.

660
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,640
I did see that.

661
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,000
However, out of respect to the honor system,

662
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,400
I did not click any links.

663
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,200
So I saw it.

664
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,960
I left that there to test your sort of, hmm, ideals.

665
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,200
You were testing us?

666
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,700
Ouch.

667
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,440
Where's the trust?

668
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
Amazing.

669
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,280
So that was another decoy in here?

670
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,600
Oh, yeah.

671
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,000
I'm very impressed in both of you gentlemen

672
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,200
for not having clicked on it.

673
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,880
But maybe you'll click on it at some point.

674
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,120
Yeah, I mean, jeez.

675
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,360
Now I'm going to wonder.

676
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,320
Now I'm going to wonder.

677
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,000
Very good.

678
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,120
Well, a fascinating topic, and one

679
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,040
that I'd love to hear from the audience,

680
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,320
linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

681
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,720
lino.com slash unplugged.

682
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,920
You know, I don't know, I was feeling nostalgic.

683
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,840
I pulled out my old original notes

684
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,040
when Linode first became a sponsor like two and a half

685
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,480
years ago or whatever it's been now.

686
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,200
Paper notes that you still have.

687
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,600
Paper notes.

688
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,760
It's awesome.

689
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,560
So you go to linuxunplugged.com slash unplugged,

690
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,480
according to my notes.

691
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,920
And if you go there, you'll get $100 in 60-day credit

692
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,300
towards a new account.

693
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,360
And it's also a way to support the show.

694
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,800
We've been spinning up Linodes recently just to play around.

695
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,300
Actually, we always do that.

696
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,600
I should mention, this is a great way

697
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,520
to actually use Linode.

698
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,020
Because if you look at the pricing,

699
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,960
it's fantastic for this, especially

700
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,560
if you get $100 credit.

701
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,960
But it's a great way to spin up fast machines

702
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,840
and try out an open source project.

703
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,120
Because the software installs crazy fast.

704
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,760
Linode's got 40 gigabit connections

705
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,880
coming into those machines.

706
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,320
So they download software crazy fast.

707
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,180
They got all the different distributions.

708
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,280
In fact, I noted in my notes right here,

709
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,840
this is a legit note to Chris from two and a half years ago.

710
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,300
Personally, one of the things that I

711
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,840
think is great about Linode is that they have all

712
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,280
these distributions they support.

713
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,800
They even have Alpines, Arches, CentOS, and for some reason,

714
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,400
they have openSUSE.

715
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,720
You were a cold, cold fellow back then.

716
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,520
I just didn't like SUSE that much back then.

717
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,240
I just didn't like it very much.

718
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,160
And I was like, why would they have that?

719
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,200
Now I'm like, it's great.

720
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,520
Now I think it's a feature.

721
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,160
But I said, what I really get about them

722
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,080
is you can definitely tell they love Linux.

723
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,600
I put that in there, right there.

724
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,640
This is the fake paper.

725
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,760
It's not real, but it's not fake either.

726
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,600
It's paper.

727
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,760
What is it?

728
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,160
Who knows?

729
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,120
Those are things that still resonate with me.

730
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,480
But go over there and get the $100.

731
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,600
Try it out and build something.

732
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,320
The great thing is their infrastructure is so impressive.

733
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,280
I mean, they've been doing this for 19 years.

734
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,320
You could throw millions of users at your website,

735
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,680
and it's going to do fine.

736
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,280
But they have a pricing structure such

737
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,560
that if you just want a website, maybe you

738
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,680
want to run a public version of Prism for friends and family,

739
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,080
the photo hosting thing that's like Google Photos

740
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,800
but self-hosted, you could do that for a few users up there.

741
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,360
You could do it for thousands.

742
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,080
They have that kind of power.

743
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,360
And I've put it to the test.

744
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,120
We have, I think, probably one of the more stressful things

745
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,400
we've done is we ran a really aggressive test

746
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,720
against PeerTube on Linode, where

747
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,480
we spun up multiple Linodes because they've

748
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,520
got 11 data centers around the world.

749
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,040
So we spun up one Linode here, I think, on the West Coast,

750
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
or sometimes we do it in Texas, depending,

751
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,760
or sometimes in the East Coast.

752
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,160
But we spun up one Linode, started a PeerTube instance

753
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,400
on there, and then spun up a bunch of other Linodes

754
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,280
around the world and had it all connect

755
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,120
in to that PeerTube instance.

756
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,680
And then while we were live, we also

757
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,880
had the audience all connect in.

758
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,840
And really, it was damn impressive

759
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,960
what that thing could take.

760
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,360
They just really built it well.

761
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,120
So go build something.

762
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,320
Go try something.

763
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:51,800
I don't know.

764
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,280
Go learn something and support the show.

765
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,240
Linode.com slash unplugged.

766
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,800
That's Linode.com slash unplugged.

767
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,240
All right, just let's do a quick spot of housekeeping here

768
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,440
because I don't think we want to take too long on this.

769
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,560
But there's a couple of things we wanted you to know.

770
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,760
To know about.

771
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,520
There is a testing week coming up for Ubuntu 22.04.

772
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,680
The release is about seven weeks away.

773
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,480
And the alpha testing is happening now,

774
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,640
which is the 6th of March, to the 10th of March.

775
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,320
The beta release will be March 31.

776
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,440
And the final release of Ubuntu 22.04 is currently scheduled.

777
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,640
And they usually hit it every time for April 21, 2022.

778
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,280
So now is the time to help the Ubuntu project out.

779
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,200
And it really matters on these LTSs.

780
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,800
They reached out, and we wanted to make sure

781
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,960
that we got that covered.

782
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Yeah, go bang on things.

783
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
See if you can break it.

784
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,760
Yeah.

785
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,440
And then we're thinking about covering IPFS.

786
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,640
By the way, I'm thinking about covering IPFS, guys.

787
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,440
I love it.

788
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,080
It just came to me this morning.

789
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,320
We've been meaning to talk about IPFS for a while.

790
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,080
It was an interplanetary file system, right?

791
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,720
I checked it out years ago, but I need a deep dive again.

792
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,880
I'm fascinated by its potential.

793
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,320
So let's talk about it.

794
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,240
And if you are a topic expert, send us

795
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,080
a boost to what you know or linuxunplug.com slash contact.

796
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,640
Let us know your experience with it and what you use it for,

797
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,640
so we can integrate that into our coverage next week.

798
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,680
Yeah, and then eventually it'll get captured in one trillion.

799
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
Yeah, probably.

800
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,520
All right, Mr. Payne.

801
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,240
Are you ready?

802
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,080
Yeah, let's decrypt this.

803
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,800
This is a big, big old block of something in here.

804
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,280
I have no idea, because I just figured why bother.

805
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,360
But let's begin the decryption process.

806
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:46,400
Oh, wait a minute.

807
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,880
Why does it smell like dog food?

808
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,160
Well, that's an integral part of the process.

809
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:56,080
No, actually this is just some base 64 encoded binary bytes,

810
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,200
which is itself a XE compressed brainfuck program.

811
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,000
OK.

812
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,800
And that was mostly just so that it could actually

813
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,240
fit in the doc in a decent way that

814
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,360
didn't overwrite the whole thing.

815
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,920
I was wondering how you were going to pull that off.

816
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,760
That's why I ended up going my route, which

817
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,440
we'll talk about in a bit.

818
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,280
Because if you properly encrypt show notes,

819
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,200
it's just going to be pages and pages, right?

820
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,640
So I was curious how you'd solve that problem.

821
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,520
Yeah, so that didn't seem obscure enough,

822
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,520
because this is all just a little bit of security

823
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,880
theater, of course, and the trust

824
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,400
that Brent didn't show for us.

825
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,400
If you got through base 64 on XE,

826
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,600
I wasn't sure if either of you had ever seen or heard

827
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,760
of brainfuck before.

828
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,520
It's a bit of a weird one.

829
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,120
I have heard of it, but I have to admit

830
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,600
I am ignorant as to really what it does.

831
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,680
But that's a name that just happens to stick.

832
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,800
Well, it's great because it's an esoteric programming

833
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,280
language, but it's super simple.

834
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,760
It has a very limited set of basic commands.

835
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,320
So you're programming at a super low level.

836
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,560
And that means you can't really tell what's going on here.

837
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,440
I'll put a little sample in the doc for you.

838
00:30:59,440 --> 00:30:59,920
OK.

839
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,720
And we'll link to some.

840
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,040
It's right above my encryption.

841
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,560
Yeah, I see that.

842
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,600
And so you just see a bunch of dashes and pluses

843
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,040
and caret symbols.

844
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,240
But you can write a brainfuck program to print out text.

845
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,360
So if you get my brainfuck program,

846
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,760
load it up in a brainfuck interpreter, run it,

847
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,840
it'll print out my topic for the day.

848
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,760
But it's specifically your brainfuck program?

849
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,200
You built a brainfuck program?

850
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,800
Well, I used a tool that helped me do that, but yes.

851
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,400
So it's like your own personal executable?

852
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:27,900
Mm-hmm.

853
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,400
Cool.

854
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,120
Well, it's interpretive.

855
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,080
It's a little script that runs.

856
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
Yeah, so I have to have brainfuck installed.

857
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,000
And then I have to run your brainfuck little interpreter

858
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,520
thing.

859
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,840
Yeah, you put my program through it, and then it will.

860
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,080
Is it in the repo?

861
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,240
Oh, you can do it online, too.

862
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,120
Oh, really?

863
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,200
Like a web-based version?

864
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,960
OK, where do I go?

865
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,160
This is exciting.

866
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,640
This is quite exciting.

867
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,880
Yeah, so you're going to want to go to copy.sh slash brainfuck.

868
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,120
That's brain with a y, right?

869
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,000
No, OK.

870
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,880
All right, so I see I have a do it now.

871
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,280
I go take what you've added here?

872
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,080
Yeah, although you probably want the full version, huh?

873
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,240
Right?

874
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,680
This is big.

875
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,240
This is fun.

876
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,320
I'm curious how much data is in this, too.

877
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,280
That's one of the interesting things about this.

878
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,760
All right, so I've got the full thing.

879
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,640
Oh, no, so that won't, because I'm getting it for you here.

880
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,640
Oh, OK.

881
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,400
And we'll put a link to copy.sh slash brainfuck in the show notes,

882
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,240
too, because you've got to see this.

883
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,840
This is a great way to just pass information around right out there

884
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,520
in the open.

885
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,080
This is fantastic.

886
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,160
We're really teaching people how to be sneaky.

887
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,480
Isn't that our goal every week?

888
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,560
I guess.

889
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,760
How to take over the world.

890
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,040
OK, so let me replace this sample with,

891
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,960
and you'll see why I didn't paste it directly,

892
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,920
because it's kind of beefy.

893
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,880
All right, I'm looking forward to this.

894
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,840
Where to go with?

895
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,120
Oh, it's in there.

896
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,040
Oh, this whole thing, I have to take all of this?

897
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,520
Yeah.

898
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,960
Holy crap.

899
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,600
Do I start with the periods?

900
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,800
Yep, it starts at the.

901
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,440
Oh, my gosh.

902
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,480
No wonder.

903
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,040
Oh, my gosh.

904
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,840
This is, what, eight pages, nine pages deep?

905
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,040
Maybe more?

906
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,400
Maybe way more?

907
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Holy crap.

908
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,240
If you double click, if you take a look in the rendered one.

909
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,160
Can you double click it, make it easy on myself?

910
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,640
Yeah.

911
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,680
I could have done that, huh?

912
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
Now do I hit Run or what?

913
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,640
Hit Run.

914
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,800
OK, oh, my gosh.

915
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,400
OK, so now I think is this markdown that's

916
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
coming out on the other end?

917
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,240
Yep.

918
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,440
This is pretty cool.

919
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,080
A moment of appreciation for open source

920
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,880
maintainers and community.

921
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,960
Oh, that's a great idea.

922
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,240
So tell us what you have here.

923
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,640
It looks like you have some links.

924
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,800
Yeah, well, I wanted to see if you guys kind of agreed.

925
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,080
You know, we talk a lot about open source.

926
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,240
Obviously, we all sort of talk about how we love it.

927
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,320
But I worry, too, that maybe we get a little jaded, somewhere

928
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,920
between jaded, take it for granted.

929
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,840
And then especially, like you and I on land,

930
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,200
we're covering a lot of the news.

931
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,200
And a lot of times, a lot of the news are like security issues,

932
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,680
like just whenever you're talking about NPM and left

933
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,840
pad and log for shell.

934
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,320
Color.js, Faker.js.

935
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,080
And there's just over the past year or two,

936
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,840
I think there's been a lot of articles kind of mentioned

937
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,480
just like this.

938
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,360
Oh, how will we solve open source software security?

939
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,760
And is it even tenable to use open source software?

940
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,040
And I mean, some of these are quite hyperbolic takes.

941
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,440
I'm not saying we take those seriously, but it.

942
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,920
All right, and the other end of the spectrum is,

943
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,800
how is open source going to be sustainable?

944
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,440
The cloud vendors are eating it alive.

945
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,600
Right, yeah, exactly.

946
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
And we talk a lot about the difficulties

947
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,640
of being an open source maintainer and all the work

948
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,800
that goes into it, often thankless or underpaid

949
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,800
or if paid at all.

950
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,280
So I'm not trying to say that those are not real,

951
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,160
because those are absolutely real.

952
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,440
I just worry that because we talk so much about them,

953
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,760
it's kind of like a news covers the bad things sort of same

954
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,640
thing that we forget sometimes about how nice it

955
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,800
is that we get to use and interact with all

956
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
this open source software.

957
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,640
And I had a small example at work this week

958
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,240
that I thought I'd share just as like, oh, this was nice,

959
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,920
and it reminded me about why I value being able to use it

960
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
and depend on it so much.

961
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,960
Oh, great.

962
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,120
So here I was writing some tests and built up

963
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,560
a thing on my system, and it's broken.

964
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,000
Doesn't work, weird cryptic error.

965
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,720
And a little bit of background is I'm using a couple of things.

966
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,920
One is PyTest, which is a framework for testing.

967
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,840
So it sort of lets you write your test files,

968
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,840
and it'll go find them on disk and get things up

969
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,560
and set them all up for you and execute them

970
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,400
and report back how your tests went.

971
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,280
Python also has asynchronous programming.

972
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,840
So in addition to regular functions,

973
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,160
you can make async functions.

974
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,480
PyTest has a plug-in that helps make these

975
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,960
act more like regular functions.

976
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,660
So you don't have to worry about some of the async details.

977
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,080
It'll handle automatically setting them up and scheduling

978
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,280
them on an event loop.

979
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,640
Oh, yeah.

980
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,720
So it does some little magic wrapping to make that happen.

981
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,760
I also use a project called Hypothesis,

982
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,280
which is a great name, although kind of hard to Google

983
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,820
sometimes if you don't know what you're doing, especially

984
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,560
because there's so much data science that's

985
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,680
done in Python as well.

986
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,040
And they also use hypothesis testing.

987
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,200
So you've got to figure out, OK, what do I pin this with?

988
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,920
Yes.

989
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,120
Thankfully, they've got a good read the docs page that

990
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,200
has basically all you need.

991
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,240
It's a tool for what's called generative testing.

992
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,740
And so the idea is instead of specific test cases,

993
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,200
not that you wouldn't do this too,

994
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,020
but to go to the next level, you describe

995
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,160
the shape of your inputs.

996
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,400
Maybe that's input to an API or to a particular function call.

997
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
And so that can be nested data structures.

998
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,240
It could just be like, this function

999
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,680
takes one integer and one string type.

1000
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,360
And then Hypothesis will handle generating

1001
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
a bunch of data from that description

1002
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,680
and then throwing it against your function or API.

1003
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,760
And then you can give it some sort of assertions.

1004
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,800
They say, given this input, I expect these things

1005
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,880
to be true about whatever happened in the background

1006
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,460
or whatever output I got.

1007
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,880
So then are you essentially doing

1008
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,360
programmatic input at scale to these things?

1009
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,520
Yeah.

1010
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,160
And then it can handle making a bunch of stuff.

1011
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,520
And then it tries to find little test cases to show.

1012
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,240
And it's really good, especially with some strings

1013
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,840
and other stuff, it'll test all the really big numbers.

1014
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,960
If you say, I'd just take a number or weird Unicode

1015
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,860
strings, it's a nice way to get yourself some extra testing

1016
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,960
and check your own assumptions about what you

1017
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,920
think your program is doing.

1018
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,440
But to do that, they're both manipulating these tests.

1019
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,400
Because Hypothesis sort of takes some of the role

1020
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,640
of executing, because it does a whole bunch of examples

1021
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,560
and kind of takes over from the test framework.

1022
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,720
So somewhere between Hypothesis, PyTest itself,

1023
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,760
and this PyTest async plugin support,

1024
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,640
it just wasn't working anymore.

1025
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,560
Jeez, man.

1026
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,540
Now, normally, these stuff, whenever I find an issue,

1027
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,380
it's already reported.

1028
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,560
This time, it had only just been reported.

1029
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,600
So I was able to dig in a little bit and help.

1030
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,840
But I was just really impressed, because there had just

1031
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,680
been a Hypothesis release.

1032
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,400
Before knowing any details, they were already like, OK,

1033
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,600
within 24 hours, we'll try to have this either fixed

1034
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,700
or rolled back.

1035
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,560
And admittedly, this is not a huge deal.

1036
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,160
It really isn't, because I can just pin that to the last

1037
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,500
release and move on.

1038
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,760
It's a particular tool used during testing.

1039
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,080
It doesn't affect production.

1040
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,200
It's really not a big deal.

1041
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,360
But I thought that was the thing.

1042
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,480
They didn't need to be that immediate about it.

1043
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,360
Yeah, it strikes me.

1044
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,520
It's like, when the developer is engaged,

1045
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,320
the experience at your position is so far above and beyond

1046
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,880
the kind of care you get from a commercial software developer.

1047
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,080
It's next level.

1048
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,040
It reminds me when you and I were implementing that DCA bot

1049
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,800
on the server here.

1050
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,120
And you discovered, what was it?

1051
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,840
There was a Python project in there that had a bug.

1052
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,320
And the developer was all over it.

1053
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,720
Oh, it was some of their getting the Docker stuff working

1054
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,760
and how the libraries were packaged in.

1055
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,840
Yeah, and I thought internally, there was some other thing

1056
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,920
that you discovered.

1057
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,040
And then you went to their GitHub,

1058
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,840
and the developer was already all over it.

1059
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,680
And you can really see, if you pick the right stack,

1060
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,880
in other words, if you use a well-supported software

1061
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,600
project when you're building stuff,

1062
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,080
the response and the care and the enthusiasm and joy

1063
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,440
that the developer can get out of it is infectious.

1064
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,360
And it's, like I just said, it's beyond anything

1065
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,240
you're ever going to get from a support contract.

1066
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,680
I was also impressed in this case,

1067
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,840
because it actually turned out that one

1068
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,320
of the issues with the hypothesis had,

1069
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,720
so it kind of has to detect, try to auto detect some stuff

1070
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,360
about the function that it's wrapping and running under test.

1071
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,440
And it got better at doing that with that latest release.

1072
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,280
Unfortunately, that meant it kind of uncovered a bug

1073
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,680
in the PyTest async IO support.

1074
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,360
Or it was one of those situations where

1075
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,800
it's kind of murky, like, is it both having bugs?

1076
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,720
Is it, like, what should happen here?

1077
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,440
But there wasn't any blame.

1078
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,320
The hypothesis folks weren't like, no, this

1079
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,640
was a PyTest async IO problem.

1080
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,640
We're not doing anything.

1081
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,280
They still fixed and did some updates

1082
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,240
and opened an issue with the other team who

1083
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,000
were receptive about it and got it fixed.

1084
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,120
And so at the end of the day, like a day later,

1085
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,840
I could undo my pin and just keep going about my life.

1086
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,880
But seeing immediately, like, all the hard work

1087
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,360
that went into it to make that happen.

1088
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,720
Yeah, and not that, no, it's his problem, not my problem.

1089
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,520
Which, it's not that I should expect,

1090
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,360
but just with humans and, you know,

1091
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,160
and we certainly sometimes cover the drama that can happen

1092
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,920
in pull requests out on GitHub.

1093
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,840
It was just nice to not see that.

1094
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,660
Indeed, that is a great story.

1095
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,240
Thank you for sharing that with us.

1096
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,160
It does remind me that there is a lot of good going

1097
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,920
on in open source, which is probably

1098
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
exactly what we needed.

1099
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,480
We'll have a link to BrainFuck, which

1100
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,000
has looked like a great way to hide stuff in plain sight.

1101
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,680
And it's neat.

1102
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,600
There's just some weird programming languages out there

1103
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,000
and it can be fun to play with.

1104
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,480
That's absolutely true.

1105
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,440
All right, so I decided for my topic

1106
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,920
to encrypt it in a very in plain sight kind of way.

1107
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,400
And I was also trying to solve the problem of how

1108
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,000
to not completely overtake the doc with like 32

1109
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,860
pages of characters.

1110
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:14,240
And I thought, well, I could link to like a pastebin

1111
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,800
kind of thing.

1112
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,920
And I almost went that route.

1113
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,600
But I felt like kind of was in violation

1114
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,640
of the spirit of the idea.

1115
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,840
And I thought we should have talked about that first.

1116
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,380
So what I decided to do instead is go for a simple route,

1117
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,480
a classic route that works every time.

1118
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,360
A mystery in plain sight.

1119
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:46,000
I went for steganography with a picture of Levi.

1120
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It's got a little bow tie in here.

1121
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,960
And steganography is great because you can hide information

1122
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,440
in plain sight.

1123
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,520
And it would have worked perfectly

1124
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,680
if I wasn't using Markdown.

1125
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,640
But the encoder tool I used butchered my Markdown

1126
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,360
a little bit.

1127
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,280
So it wasn't great.

1128
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,960
But I think the concept was still solid.

1129
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,560
I felt like it.

1130
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,560
So not only did you ruin partially your Markdown,

1131
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,880
you made the picture of Levi slightly degraded,

1132
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,680
which that should be a sin right there.

1133
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,920
And 8.9 megabytes.

1134
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,880
Yeah, it really.

1135
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,600
It's like if you were looking to see which photo had

1136
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,360
the secret information, and this isn't even

1137
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,880
a ton of information, you would just look at the file size

1138
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,120
and be the one of these is not like the others.

1139
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,360
So it's not that sneaky.

1140
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,680
But I have found this great little spots

1141
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,600
from friends of the family out in really just

1142
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,080
like the bottom of the Cascades, just really at the foothill.

1143
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,400
But the only problem is, and we want

1144
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,720
to go out there to visit them, but the only problem is,

1145
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,520
well, it's a great thing, but there's no internet out there.

1146
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,160
It's possible the Starlink might work.

1147
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,280
But I actually, I don't know, because they

1148
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,920
tried to get Starlink out there and they told them

1149
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,720
it's not available.

1150
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,760
Oh.

1151
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,080
Now, I've decided what I want to do

1152
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,280
is rebuild my offline Oracle.

1153
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,560
And this is an idea that I've talked about on self-hosted

1154
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,160
before.

1155
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,160
And it's to create a self-sufficient knowledge

1156
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,560
base in the RV that essentially creates

1157
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,400
the experience of being online without being online.

1158
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,880
And so here's my thinking on this.

1159
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,880
Oh, I like this.

1160
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,200
There are two different options, and I'm

1161
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,360
going to play with both of them, but I'd really

1162
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,840
like people's feedback too.

1163
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,360
On YouTube server, YouTube DL servers,

1164
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,600
I'd love it to be YTDL server, that runs in a container

1165
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,800
on a Raspberry Pi, and it gives me a web interface

1166
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,360
that I just drop a YouTube URL into.

1167
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,000
And then it downloads in the background

1168
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,960
and saves the MP4 from YouTube to my local hard drive

1169
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,480
where I tell it to.

1170
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,880
And then I have a local PeerTube instance

1171
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,160
that is indexing that folder that these videos download to.

1172
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,680
So then the idea being that later on when

1173
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,680
we need to do something.

1174
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,300
So we wanted to go out to this location

1175
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,600
because our friends here are very handy.

1176
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,920
They've helped us build things in the past.

1177
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,880
But have the ability to watch the tutorials and stuff

1178
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,480
that we have found so useful on YouTube

1179
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,560
without having YouTube.

1180
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:06,800
Right.

1181
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,840
I mean, that's kind of a lot of the workflow, especially

1182
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,160
for home improvement stuff these days, right?

1183
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,880
It's like, can I re-consult this six times

1184
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,920
so I can figure out what I'm doing?

1185
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,920
Oh, it's so great, right?

1186
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,920
Like, seriously now, if we need to go fix something

1187
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,720
in the plumbing or check something with the wiring,

1188
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,040
one of my first stops now is I check YouTube

1189
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,880
and see if somebody else is torn this thing apart in their RV

1190
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,400
and has replaced it before, or how do you

1191
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,560
change the oil in the generator?

1192
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,480
I learn via YouTube.

1193
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,360
So I want to collect all those.

1194
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,760
And I have a playlist where I've saved a lot of these

1195
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,800
on YouTube already, not all of them, but a lot of them.

1196
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,100
And I want to be able to add more as time goes on when

1197
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,640
I do have internet connectivity.

1198
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,280
I think Brent, Casey, and myself all have the same question.

1199
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,320
Brent, take it away.

1200
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,320
Chris, why are you landing on PeerTube instead

1201
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,940
of something like Jellyfin or EvenPlex

1202
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,280
that you already have in place?

1203
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,240
That's a great question.

1204
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,000
Can't you just download it to a folder there,

1205
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,740
and it's already doing everything for you?

1206
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,320
So I'll do all of the above.

1207
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,680
I will have it indexed by Plex or Jellyfin.

1208
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,920
So it'll be available on the TV.

1209
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,040
But I am imagining, in five years,

1210
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,360
we could be looking at 300 videos,

1211
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,200
because it's not just going to be RV stuff.

1212
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,440
It's going to be any kind of construction things

1213
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,800
that Hideo wants to work on.

1214
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,600
It's going to be gardening topics.

1215
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,880
It's going to be an oracle of information.

1216
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,320
And I think one of the ways to browse

1217
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,720
that is by having a YouTube-like front end that

1218
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,560
has search, that has categories, that has playlists.

1219
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,340
I think there is real utility to that.

1220
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,640
I don't think it's going to be.

1221
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,480
And what's great about having this as my own oracle here

1222
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,480
is I can consume it in any way I want.

1223
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,600
So I could just bring up the file system

1224
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,420
and look at the MP4 files.

1225
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,840
I could bring it up on Jellyfin on the TV.

1226
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,600
Or I could do PeerTube on our computer.

1227
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,560
And if you think about how you kind of start

1228
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,920
a project like this, it's usually

1229
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
you bring up the laptop or something like that.

1230
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,720
You start looking at stuff.

1231
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,640
I think it's just one of the nice ways to do it.

1232
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,680
But combine that with right now, and to your question earlier,

1233
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,560
Brent, I'm using something called, oh, I always

1234
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,560
get the name wrong, Wes.

1235
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,520
Oh, I can't wait for this one.

1236
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,360
And you only have it in your secret doc.

1237
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,040
So we can't help you.

1238
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,360
You're on your own this time.

1239
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,640
I think it's Ranteo.

1240
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,280
OK.

1241
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,760
R-A-N-E-T-O. Ranteo?

1242
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,240
Ranteo.

1243
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,480
Ranteo.

1244
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,960
I don't know because that E is before the T. I don't know.

1245
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,920
But this, oh, god, it's such a simple but powerful tool.

1246
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,760
Markdown-powered knowledge base.

1247
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,920
It sits on top of just Markdown files, not a database.

1248
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,400
You could SSH in, write it all up in nano, like a gentleman,

1249
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,640
save it to the file system.

1250
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,600
And then the next time you load this page up,

1251
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,400
it'll be on there.

1252
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,480
And then it displays it as the HTML version.

1253
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,720
Moustache templates.

1254
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,640
It also gives you search.

1255
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,000
It's just basically it's a Node.js app, right?

1256
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,280
I think I don't remember, but I seem to recall just

1257
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,760
being a Node.js app.

1258
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,080
But it's a really nice way to present the information.

1259
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,640
It supports syntax highlighting.

1260
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,160
It does have a search powered by Lunar, L-U-N-R.

1261
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,520
And of course, it uses Markdown, which is my preferred way

1262
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,360
to take notes.

1263
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,040
And so you can document, like what I've done in the past,

1264
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,280
I'll document something using VS code.

1265
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,160
I have the SSH save as extension installed.

1266
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,240
And then I just save as to this directory.

1267
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,080
And then the next time we pull this up,

1268
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,280
all the information is there.

1269
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,560
That's nice.

1270
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,160
I'll also, it's where I also capture my Docker compose files

1271
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,160
for looking up later on.

1272
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,080
And I really like this workflow.

1273
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,160
But I'm also, and I would love feedback

1274
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,600
if anybody out there has tried Bookstack.

1275
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,240
I'm looking at Bookstack.

1276
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,160
This is really similar.

1277
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,720
It's at bookstackapp.com.

1278
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,600
This leans a little more towards wiki.

1279
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,120
And I know, oh man, I know there's so many wikis.

1280
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,560
Tiny wiki, tiddly wiki.

1281
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,880
I know, and they're really good.

1282
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,520
I like, no one else can see this,

1283
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,040
but you pointed at the IRC room as if they were trying

1284
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,200
to send you wikis.

1285
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,520
I totally like just wagged my finger.

1286
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,360
I know chat room, I know.

1287
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,760
Like a torrent of wikis is coming for you.

1288
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,520
The links are coming.

1289
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,280
But Bookstack is a simple, self-hosted,

1290
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,040
easy to use platform for organizing

1291
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,280
and storing information.

1292
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,040
And again, Markdown supported, MIT licensed.

1293
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,000
It's up on GitHub.

1294
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,080
And you can use a WYSIWYG interface

1295
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,720
to take the notes if you like.

1296
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,440
It supports things like chapters.

1297
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,240
You can organize things into books.

1298
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,960
I mean, it seems really powerful.

1299
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,840
And it also has some authentication options.

1300
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,480
You can actually be, that's my one thing is.

1301
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,000
Yeah, that's a whole other layer here.

1302
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,760
Yeah.

1303
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,000
I don't have that kind of security with Ranteo

1304
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,560
or however you say it.

1305
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,840
And this even supports two-factor authentication,

1306
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,240
which could be really nice when you

1307
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,440
want to put sensitive information in there.

1308
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,480
And I could then take it to the next level.

1309
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,880
And it'll also integrate with a single sign-on provider

1310
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,920
and that kind of stuff.

1311
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,720
So I'd love to know if anybody has experience with Bookstack.

1312
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:51,200
Send me a boost or send me an email

1313
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,160
and let me know what your experiences are with it,

1314
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,080
if you have.

1315
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,880
Because I'm considering it, but it seems like a big jump.

1316
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,200
And then last but not least, I think

1317
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,040
it's pronounced Heemdall, H-E-I-M-D-A-L-L.

1318
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,360
This is what I'm going to set on our home

1319
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:10,520
pages for our browsers at home that is a really easy

1320
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,080
to build home dashboard, where I'll have links

1321
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,240
to the knowledge base, links to Home Assistant.

1322
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,360
You can have widgets in there.

1323
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,860
I'll have the Bitcoin price in there

1324
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,760
because I like to torture myself like that.

1325
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,560
And you can have news headlines in there, feeds in there.

1326
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,080
Very easy to set up.

1327
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:29,520
And just about all of this is even available as a Linux server

1328
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,160
I.O.

1329
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:30,880
Oh, cool.

1330
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,520
Great.

1331
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,000
I don't know if all of it is, but most of it, if not all of it.

1332
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,640
So this is my journey I'm starting.

1333
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:40,320
My goal is by August to have all of this implemented.

1334
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,320
The reason why I'm giving myself that much time

1335
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,480
is because I'm still considering hardware changes.

1336
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,560
I'm going to go into a lot more detail and self-host it

1337
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:48,480
once I have it all figured out.

1338
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,120
And I'll document the journey there

1339
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,360
and what I end up with it all.

1340
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,000
But I'm at the very beginning phase

1341
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,200
right now with the idea of really taking this offline home

1342
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,920
that I have in our in-juice right now, which

1343
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,040
is made up of two to three pies, depending

1344
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,280
if I want my camera recorder going or not.

1345
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,840
And I'm curious to know how I can refactor that

1346
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,880
and what this next generation of software is looking at.

1347
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,080
I'm kind of reconsidering doing my entire home assistant setup.

1348
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,080
Like, it's a big summer project coming up.

1349
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,120
Yeah, I like this.

1350
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,840
Yeah, I think it's going to be good.

1351
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,040
And I suspect it's all going to really come down

1352
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,720
to just the least friction for the family

1353
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,080
to get the information they need.

1354
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:30,560
Like, whatever system they take, whatever they're good with,

1355
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,400
I can adapt.

1356
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,200
I'll adapt to that.

1357
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,160
Yeah, you just need them to buy into the system at all, right?

1358
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,560
That's going to be part of this process

1359
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,160
is you've got to get family buy-off.

1360
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,120
Otherwise, for example, if my wife, Adia,

1361
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,680
isn't inputting the information, then we're

1362
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,920
only capturing half the stuff.

1363
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,680
And she keeps really good track of all of the repair records

1364
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,040
and stuff.

1365
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,640
And that's a great example of something

1366
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,360
I'd love in a system like this.

1367
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,040
So we shall see.

1368
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,840
But I'd love to hear people's experience with it.

1369
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,280
And it was an adorable picture of Levi, wasn't it?

1370
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,000
Oh, I could share the link, couldn't we?

1371
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,160
Yeah, I'll put a link to the show notes

1372
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,560
if you want to run that through a decrypter.

1373
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,080
That's my Levi right there.

1374
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,800
Can you tell us which piece of software

1375
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,960
to throw your information behind to Levi?

1376
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,760
Your Dagonography, let's say?

1377
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,560
You know, I tried a couple of desktop apps.

1378
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,560
But then I realized I wanted to just do it here

1379
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,760
at the studio machine.

1380
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,600
I didn't want to install anything.

1381
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,240
So I just Google searched a web's Dagonography tool,

1382
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,200
which is why I think it botched my markdown.

1383
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,280
If I'd used a proper app.

1384
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,600
You're throwing shade on the tool, huh?

1385
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,400
Oh, yeah.

1386
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,520
My markdown's not solid, dude.

1387
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,600
What are you talking about?

1388
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:38,720
My markdown is absolutely solid.

1389
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,800
It's not my fault.

1390
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,960
And now, as the French say, it is time for Le Boost.

1391
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,600
Why don't we do, before we get to the Boost, just some super

1392
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,520
compact follow-up to last week's episode.

1393
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,840
Last week, we talked about the Umbral project,

1394
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,240
which lets you run containers and do self-hosting

1395
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,880
with their front-end UI.

1396
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,960
And they followed up on our episode

1397
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,520
and let us know that one of the features they're rolling out

1398
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,200
in the near future is the ability

1399
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,720
to uninstall the Bitcoin node aspect of that.

1400
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,440
So Umbral sounded interesting, but you

1401
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,520
didn't want to dedicate the disk space to a node.

1402
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,600
That's going to now just be like one of the apps

1403
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,600
that you'll be able to install or remove.

1404
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,240
Nice.

1405
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,080
Yeah.

1406
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,360
Also on the topic of Umbral, a software update

1407
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:28,840
included the Snowflake Tor proxy, which is really easy.

1408
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,520
Just one click to install now.

1409
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,600
They're doing this to help Ukrainian and Russian

1410
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,600
journalists and activists and civilians that

1411
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,160
are trying to bypass internet restrictions

1412
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,520
and really anyone who needs to use the Tor project to help

1413
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,120
bypass censorship.

1414
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,000
This Snowflake Tor proxy is a standalone project on its own.

1415
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,640
I'll have a link to it in the show notes

1416
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,960
if you're interested.

1417
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,040
And it's a way to add some capacity to the Tor network

1418
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,280
without revealing your own IP.

1419
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,800
It uses an IP from the Tor node internally.

1420
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,360
And you're helping route some of that.

1421
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,760
And it's run by volunteers.

1422
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,800
And now it's a one-click app install on Umbral

1423
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,680
if you would like to do so.

1424
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,600
Slick.

1425
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,080
But we do have some boosts.

1426
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,800
We do have some boosts.

1427
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,920
Batvin321 sent this in two days ago.

1428
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,640
50 sats, which is like 0.2 cents, I think.

1429
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,280
Something like that.

1430
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,880
But Bat lives on the East Coast.

1431
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,560
And he's looking to hitch a ride with somebody from Maryland

1432
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,600
for five hours to get to the meetup.

1433
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,800
So if you want a road buddy from Maryland on,

1434
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,280
send a boost to us with your contact info.

1435
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,800
And we will put you guys in touch.

1436
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,520
Heck yeah.

1437
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,240
We got another boost from Dave Jones.

1438
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,080
He seems to be one of our favorites.

1439
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,200
He says, 8 terabytes.

1440
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,320
Holy crap.

1441
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,280
You have enough room for 50 years of blockchain.

1442
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,280
Huzzah.

1443
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,240
Yeah, but I got to run multiple nodes, right?

1444
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,040
I got to have space for it.

1445
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,480
I'm running other nodes.

1446
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,040
Yeah, you're on all kinds of chains.

1447
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,440
I love it.

1448
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,080
George Boosts in with 1,000 sats.

1449
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,520
Trying out the Lightning Network.

1450
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,400
Thanks for the awesome recommendation.

1451
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,600
Thank you, George.

1452
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,360
One of the reasons we are featuring the boosts

1453
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,020
in the show, because seriously, that's not a lot of money,

1454
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,800
although we really do appreciate it.

1455
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,880
I think the more we build this out,

1456
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,560
and it's a peer-to-peer network, the more possibilities

1457
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:15,160
we have down the road of finding other alternative ways

1458
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,920
to finance free software.

1459
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,240
And we have free software developers in Ukraine right now

1460
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,800
that their whole world's just changed.

1461
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,080
We have free software developers in Russia.

1462
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,680
Their whole world just changed.

1463
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,520
We need to have a system that maybe runs parallel

1464
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,600
to all of that.

1465
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,280
And so as the audience of the world's largest Linux podcast

1466
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,080
begins to adopt a system like this,

1467
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,560
we are building out a peer-to-peer network that

1468
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,480
is the same exact kind of audience

1469
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,880
that is likely to help contribute to free software.

1470
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,000
So I think there is, when George gets all hooked up here,

1471
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,600
he's trying out the Lightning Network.

1472
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,760
He's building a pathway now that if his favorite free software

1473
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,560
project down the road starts doing this,

1474
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,000
starts running free software and taking a free software

1475
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,160
currency over the internet, he now

1476
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,640
has all the plumbing to support that project.

1477
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,400
I think that's huge.

1478
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,880
Also, Matt wrote in as well.

1479
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,760
He says, y'all should really check out Start9's embassy.

1480
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,680
Same idea as Umbral with a different approach.

1481
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,320
I personally use Umbral and love it.

1482
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,400
But it seems like the Start9 guys

1483
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,480
are focused on the long term.

1484
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,320
Great interview with one of the guys from Start9,

1485
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,160
and he linked to us.

1486
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,280
Guys, have you heard of Start9 before?

1487
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,040
We got a few people writing in about it,

1488
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,640
and I hadn't heard of it before.

1489
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,760
I don't think I had either.

1490
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,880
No, no.

1491
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,760
It looks great.

1492
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,800
Same kind of idea.

1493
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,120
You can either buy a box.

1494
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,320
So they got a $630 box that has a two terabyte SSD connected

1495
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,720
to a Raspberry Pi 4.

1496
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,280
And it's that same idea of a plug and play private server

1497
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,280
that allows one click installation with some good

1498
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,240
sane defaults of some of the most powerful popular self

1499
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,440
hosted applications that allow you to take sovereign control

1500
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,560
over your data, or your finances, or your chat,

1501
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,560
or whatever it might be.

1502
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,040
And what do you know, a DIY guide with a Raspberry Pi.

1503
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,760
Yeah, that's pretty nice.

1504
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,840
I thought their model was kind of interesting too.

1505
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,100
You can buy Start9 OS for like $180 USD,

1506
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,080
or you can build it yourself, which

1507
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,360
is their seemingly, I think, only sort of do

1508
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,600
yourself open source version.

1509
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,880
So I thought that was fascinating,

1510
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,920
and hopefully it keeps the project going as well.

1511
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,960
Seems like they're doing some interesting work.

1512
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,760
Yeah, I mean, imagine, dude, if this thing

1513
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,840
helped you de-Google completely, that's

1514
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,320
probably worth $180.

1515
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,280
Oh, I'd say so.

1516
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,000
Yeah.

1517
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,440
Sometimes it's nice to see that they've at least,

1518
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,720
whether or not you like it, they're

1519
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,640
at least thinking about how to support themselves and keep

1520
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,400
development going.

1521
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,760
So if you're going to buy into the platform,

1522
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,600
that's probably good.

1523
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:42,000
The reality is putting a price on it that's $180 is real money.

1524
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,960
That's $5 isn't going to pay the bills.

1525
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,140
$180 maybe actually makes a difference,

1526
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:49,200
and it makes a project sustainable.

1527
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,320
I think we're going to have to come around and realize

1528
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,360
that boutique software, anything that's a small boutique team

1529
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,280
working on something for a niche audience

1530
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,560
is always going to be struggling to monetize.

1531
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,120
And that comes for content, or it's

1532
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,560
true for free software development.

1533
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:07,000
And that's why I look at the price $630 for a machine,

1534
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,640
that's probably not even a lot of profit in that for them.

1535
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,840
But there's definitely some, because they're

1536
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,560
building around a pie and a case and a whole setup.

1537
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,760
So hopefully start nine is something

1538
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,040
that could be around for a while.

1539
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,920
Because sovereign computing, as this term

1540
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,920
is becoming more popular, I can really

1541
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,920
wrap my head around that.

1542
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,960
It doesn't have to have anything to do with Bitcoin.

1543
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,280
It can just mean you switched to Bitwarden from LastPass.

1544
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,480
Maybe it means you switched from WhatsApp to Matrix,

1545
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,040
or something like that.

1546
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,400
It is, I think, going to be a really important topic

1547
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,120
on the show for a while, is applying self-control where

1548
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:46,200
you decide it's appropriate, and not being a hardliner about it,

1549
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,460
not being a purist about it, but being

1550
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,480
sensible and realistic and practical about it,

1551
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,000
and realize that each one of us has our own comfort level.

1552
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
So let's talk about what some of our options are.

1553
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,880
Yeah, Chris, I agree.

1554
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,880
And Dave also wrote in about start nine.

1555
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,560
He sort of clued us onto that.

1556
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,680
But he asked a question about Tor, specifically.

1557
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,360
And I thought that was worth mentioning,

1558
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,760
since we forgot to mention it last week.

1559
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,160
He said, I've been hearing you guys rave about Umbral.

1560
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,800
And it sent me down the rabbit hole

1561
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,520
of this type of all-in-one server solution, which

1562
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,480
I'm diving in with you.

1563
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,000
While doing my research on Umbral,

1564
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,560
I caught a post about start nine.

1565
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,800
On the surface, it seems very similar to Umbral,

1566
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,640
with a focus on Bitcoin and privacy-based apps.

1567
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,720
What I found interesting was their use of the Tor network

1568
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,120
to allow secure access to your home lab remotely.

1569
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,160
Have you seen this before?

1570
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,200
I currently rely on WireGuard via TailScale

1571
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,460
for my home lab access.

1572
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,800
But I was intrigued by the Tor idea.

1573
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,040
That is really handy.

1574
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,340
Umbral does this as well.

1575
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,480
We didn't really get into it.

1576
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,360
But my methodology is actually to use TailScale.

1577
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,120
I'm a little more comfortable with that.

1578
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,800
And I prefer to turn the Tor stuff off.

1579
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,840
However, the nice thing is some developers

1580
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:58,440
are building Tor support into the client app on your phone.

1581
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,760
And so you can connect to your Umbral services

1582
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,000
or your start nine services over Tor.

1583
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,280
The advantage to that is, besides the obvious privacy

1584
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,280
advantages, which are not insignificant,

1585
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,780
the advantage is that you don't have

1586
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,120
to fumble around with NAT or port forwarding

1587
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,080
or any of that junk.

1588
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,920
You don't have to start bringing in outside connections

1589
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,240
from any WAN address into your LAN.

1590
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,040
You don't worry about any of that.

1591
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:30,680
These systems help generate Tor addresses

1592
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,200
for your individual applications running on them.

1593
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,720
Now, you can look into the security or safety of that.

1594
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,440
I have preferred just to turn it off.

1595
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,800
But it's certainly nice, because if you leave it on,

1596
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,800
then you get one of these apps like BlueWallet

1597
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,840
or some of these other apps that can

1598
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,280
connect to these different services.

1599
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,960
And you give them your Onion address,

1600
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,300
or whatever it's called, or whatever the URL is.

1601
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:50,540
I really don't use Tor enough to probably talk

1602
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,760
about it intelligently.

1603
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,760
But then the app can connect to it without, again,

1604
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,720
any ports being opened or anything like that.

1605
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,160
It's really nice.

1606
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,880
Yeah, you can see it acting as sort of the standard, right?

1607
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,540
That, yeah, different parties can come to,

1608
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,800
and then you're all in the same high-level network.

1609
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,560
Yeah.

1610
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,760
You know, what I loved about these platforms is that,

1611
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,060
and I think I mentioned this last week, is that for me,

1612
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,800
it was just maybe a touching stone

1613
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,520
on investigating a bunch of technologies I'm curious about.

1614
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,640
And so getting to play with Tor, I've heard of it for decades.

1615
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:22,240
But to have it just be accessible so easily via Umbral,

1616
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,720
it was really fun, actually, just booting up the Tor browser

1617
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,280
and seeing kind of how that works.

1618
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,800
Maybe we should do an episode on unique use cases for Tor.

1619
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,520
And maybe, because that kind of would go well with our IPFS

1620
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,040
episode.

1621
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:34,480
Yeah.

1622
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,360
I don't know, something to think about if people have any ideas.

1623
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,360
Send us a boost.

1624
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,360
Boost a grant.

1625
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,720
Get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

1626
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,000
And then send us a boost and let us

1627
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,200
know what you think we should cover with Tor or IPFS.

1628
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,320
That would be pretty great.

1629
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,840
I think that could be an area that we could probably

1630
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,000
find some unique uses for.

1631
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,880
I wonder if there's a way we could get access

1632
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,880
to a system in the studio using Tor,

1633
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,340
and then people could do something.

1634
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,840
I think we could have fun with that.

1635
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,460
Come find us at a future Onion address.

1636
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,040
Yeah.

1637
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:06,840
We may have one for you soon.

1638
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,680
Or join us live and hang out while we're

1639
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,640
producing these shows.

1640
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:13,200
We do them on Sundays at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern,

1641
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,920
at jblive.tv, or you can t'watch us at twitch.tv

1642
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,240
slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

1643
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,640
And then you get a t'watchification

1644
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,400
when we go live.

1645
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,000
And that seems pretty useful.

1646
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,320
See you next week.

1647
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,000
Same bad time, same bad station.

1648
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,760
If you haven't caught Linux action news yet,

1649
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,400
what are you doing?

1650
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,200
How about some accurate, concise coverage

1651
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,720
that tells you exactly what you need

1652
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,560
to know without any of the stupid drama

1653
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,920
added in with clear explanations on how it impacts you

1654
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:39,920
and the wider industry?

1655
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,320
Because that's Linux action news.

1656
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,520
That's what you're missing.

1657
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,360
Oh my god, that's embarrassing.

1658
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,520
Linuxactionnews.com.

1659
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,760
Go get it.

1660
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,440
More Westpane over there as well.

1661
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,760
So how could you miss it?

1662
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,520
Links to everything we talked about today

1663
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,560
are at linuxunplug.com slash 448, our contact page

1664
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,800
for your emails, which we love, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1665
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,800
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

1666
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,080
of the Unplugged program.

1667
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,200
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1668
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:23,200
Oh.

1669
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,200
Mm-hm.

1670
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:50,600
All right, while we vote on the title at JBtitles.com, I think we should give some airtime to One

1671
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:56,440
Note because I know it has its lovers. And in full balance, I think it's only appropriate.

1672
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,320
So none of us use it. So New West has offered to be the One Note guy.

1673
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,240
You know what I appreciate on a Linux show, a guy who's willing to come on

1674
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,280
and admit he uses One Note. So tell us why you love it so much.

1675
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:16,120
I don't know if I love it so much is the right term. Try and save a little bit of face there,

1676
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:25,080
right? Fair enough. But I like how it's so incredibly easy to set up and get going and

1677
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:29,640
you don't have to worry about manually syncing anything. You don't have to worry about self

1678
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:36,200
hosting. It's kind of along those lines of why your average person doesn't have a NextCloud

1679
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:41,960
instance, right? Because there's a lot of things that you have to do in order to get that kind of

1680
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:48,200
functionality working. And so I've never looked into note taking apps. And y'all always talk

1681
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,840
about, oh, I just take my notes in Markdown or whatever. It's like, I'm not great at Markdown.

1682
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:59,720
Not yet. So I can't really, that doesn't come as easy to me. And so the fact that One Note just

1683
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:09,720
syncs and I can access it via a web UI as well, right? Which is how I use it on Linux.

1684
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,240
Oh, I was going to ask about that. Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Wait, wait, tab the brakes.

1685
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:18,280
Is this a hosted OneNote that you're accessing? Is it your own local instance over the web? Like,

1686
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:22,520
how does that work? It's Microsoft. So, so you just, so it's like a hosted thing. Yeah. It's

1687
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:27,560
like a hosted thing. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And then I log into my Microsoft account and it syncs

1688
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:35,240
all of my OneNote notebooks that I have. I've got the apps on my phone and my tablet too,

1689
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:41,400
which is great. It's got really good pen support. So I've got like a Tab S6 Lite. And so if I want

1690
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,280
to do handwritten notes, I just pull out my pen, I pull out my tablet and I just write handwritten

1691
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:51,400
notes down. That part's tempting too. Best of both worlds right there. I would like to try that.

1692
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:58,520
Man, I would like to try. Yeah, it's really, it's, it's super easy. And I think the one thing I don't

1693
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,600
like about it, aside from obviously the privacy concerns, right, is probably that it gets a little

1694
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:08,200
messy. I feel like I have to go in and prune my notebooks because I've got a whole bunch of them.

1695
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:13,160
And because you don't really control the data, like I haven't, I, and I haven't really dedicated

1696
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:16,680
a lot of time to this either, but I find that I have like a bunch of old notebooks that I've kind

1697
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:21,640
of like created and jotted one or two notes down. And now they're just like forever. They're getting

1698
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:28,920
synced across all of my devices. Yes. All right. Well, thanks for the OneNote perspective.

1699
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,920
Here's to you, Microsoft.
