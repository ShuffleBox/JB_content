00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,160
Big CES week.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,040
And Michael over at Ferronix said not as big of a deal

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,320
for Linux as it was last year,

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,880
and he may or may not be right,

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,000
but I was sure spotting a lot of Linux

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,980
in NVIDIA's live demo.

7
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,520
So NVIDIA today announced the PX2,

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,120
which is the second generation of what they call

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,240
their computer, their mini supercomputer for a car.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,400
That's what they call it.

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,320
And it's a big, massive NVIDIA box that is liquid cooled

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,160
for this new version, the PX2.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,440
It's a big box with an ODB2 connector,

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,200
and it's meant to go in your computer

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
and power these self-driving cars.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,120
We talked a little bit about it,

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,640
Poppy and I did today, actually, in Tech Talk today.

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,080
Like one of the nice things is it can process

19
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,480
2800 images a second.

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,400
Wowee.

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,080
Yeah, it's got eight teraflops of processing,

22
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,080
12 CPU cores, and it is a pretty neat beast.

23
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,240
And we talked more details in Tech Talk,

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,160
but check out the demo here, how cool this is,

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,560
and then I wanna show you where the Linux is involved.

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,720
Like you were saying, there's millions of points

27
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,880
per second coming in.

28
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,720
We can't just throw all of this at the driver

29
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,560
as they're going down the road.

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,220
They won't understand what's happening.

31
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,040
So we need to distill and refine the localization

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,280
of where the vehicle is into both the lane.

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,960
The Here HD maps help us draw these lanes perfectly.

34
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,080
Every vehicle that's coming past that's noticed

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,520
by the LIDAR or by the cameras,

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,680
refined and placed properly in their lanes.

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,160
So all of these cars that I see around us right now,

38
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,720
they're real cars.

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,480
I mean, they're not some kind of imaginary cars.

40
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,360
They're real cars that we've detected.

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,960
And we know where they are in 3D space.

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,160
We know how fast they're traveling.

43
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,360
We know how fast we're traveling relative to it.

44
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,040
And we know what lanes they're all in now

45
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,320
because we've identified everybody,

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,920
we've localized everybody.

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,080
And we know the path that we're gonna be taking,

48
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,720
optional paths that we might be taking.

49
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,360
All of this information we can present

50
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,880
in a very refined fashion so that somebody can relax,

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,280
have a serene ride down the road.

52
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,280
But how do we know that this isn't just a mock-up,

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,160
some kind of a demo?

54
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,800
You know, I think one of the best things that we can see

55
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,000
is actually what it looks like going down the road

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,960
with real information.

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,000
So if we look at it with the video.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,760
Unfortunately, we don't have a windshield in front of you,

59
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,000
but let's put a virtual windshield up here.

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,160
Yeah, so this is the actual information driving down 101

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,680
with the vehicles passing.

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,480
All of this is being computed in real time.

63
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,400
This is not a video down below.

64
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,240
This is-

65
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,280
Look at that, it's just changed lanes.

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,920
The car in front of me has just changed lanes.

67
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,200
Two cars just come up next to us.

68
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,920
We don't need rear view mirrors anymore.

69
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,160
All right, so that's a little bold there.

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,000
Just get rid of them.

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,200
Yeah, just a little more.

72
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,600
There's no reason to ever have to look around you.

73
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,800
Yeah, you can just loop there

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
is all it's doing right there.

75
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,280
And because our sensors are so robust

76
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,700
and because we have so many redundant sensors,

77
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,020
it is possible for us to detect

78
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,680
all of these different cars.

79
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,240
And we talked more about the image processing

80
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,480
and recognition in Tech Talk,

81
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,040
but if you look at the presentation,

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,080
during the presentations,

83
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,560
one of the things you would have noticed

84
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,180
showing up on screen over and over again,

85
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,440
Popey, do you know what it is?

86
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,260
Did you catch it?

87
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,100
Oh, I know this.

88
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,200
What is it, what is it, what is it?

89
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,560
No, no, I don't.

90
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,400
Oh, you don't?

91
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,680
Oh, well, it's fedora.

92
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,160
No, actually it's a lots of Ubuntu.

93
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,240
There are demos like last year,

94
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,400
we run on Ubuntu, the machines are running Ubuntu.

95
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,760
It's Ubuntu all over the place.

96
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,660
All right, they're up on stage

97
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,520
during the video presentation at CES.

98
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,200
You knew that because they did it last year

99
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,020
and the year before,

100
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,320
but I still think it's pretty damn cool.

101
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,160
It is cool.

102
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,880
This self-driving supercomputer car thingy.

103
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,760
You know it's cool because of that leather jacket.

104
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,040
That leather jacket, it was one of the best investments

105
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,400
that CEO has ever made.

106
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,120
That dude wears it up on stage every single event.

107
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,520
And you know what, I like him.

108
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,000
He seems to kind of actually,

109
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,960
he seems like a CEO that actually knows his stuff.

110
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
So you gotta respect that.

111
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,040
Actually, now you come to say it,

112
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,960
I can't think of any car automation demos

113
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,920
that I've seen in the last year or two

114
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,360
that don't have Ubuntu on them somehow.

115
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,000
At some point in the development, right?

116
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,080
Yeah, like either the computers

117
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,960
that are connecting to the in-car system

118
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,520
or the computers that are developing the sensors, yeah.

119
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,880
In fact, I think, you know what?

120
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,360
It's almost, it would be more shocking

121
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,920
if they were doing it on Windows.

122
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,640
Yeah.

123
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,880
That's what we'd be talking about.

124
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,480
Wow, now that is your story right there, everybody.

125
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,480
This is Linux Unplugged episode 126 for January 5th, 2016.

126
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

127
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,880
that's for people who like to mess with computers.

128
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,720
My name is Chris.

129
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,560
And my name is Wes.

130
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,120
Hey there, Wes, happy new year.

131
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,160
Happy new year to you, Chris.

132
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,000
Oh, thank you.

133
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,040
You know, after today's episode,

134
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,760
I'm going to go ride a horse.

135
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,280
Really?

136
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,160
Yeah, happy birthday.

137
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,480
It's my daughter, Abby.

138
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,680
She turned five today.

139
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,640
Happy birthday, Abby.

140
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,480
Yeah, so after this, we're going to go ride horses.

141
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,520
That sounds great.

142
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,040
Hopefully, it's not raining.

143
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,080
Great, it sounds great.

144
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,920
No, it's indoors.

145
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,400
Oh, OK.

146
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,160
I thought, come on.

147
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,400
I thought you were not much of an equestrian there, Chris.

148
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,160
No.

149
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,920
Well, I used to be back in the day, long story.

150
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,760
Make sure someone films this, and I think

151
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,760
it would make great Patreon content.

152
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,560
All right, well, coming up on today's episode,

153
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,840
hopefully, we've got some great content for you.

154
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,960
We're going to get an update on the new Linux

155
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,520
update from the Mycroft project, straight from Ryan's mouth,

156
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,600
a.k.a. the horse's mouth.

157
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,360
Also, later on in the show, every single year,

158
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,640
this chap out there puts out the big list of all of the things

159
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,280
that are super wrong in Linux.

160
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,920
Major Linux problems on the desktop.

161
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,960
The 2016 edition is out, and the list is extensive,

162
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,760
to say the least.

163
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,480
We're going to go through the list.

164
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,220
Wes and I read the whole dang thing.

165
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,720
We picked out the important bits that we need to respond to,

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
and we're going to do it right here in the show

167
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,820
with the whole virtual lug.

168
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,520
There are some pain points the guys got us on.

169
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,480
Oh, yeah, for sure.

170
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,920
And they're helpful observations.

171
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,400
Yeah, and if you're thinking about switching to Linux,

172
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,280
there are probably things you should know about going in.

173
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,120
So we're going to talk about that.

174
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,960
But there's also a few points.

175
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,000
Kind of misses the mark on.

176
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,120
Kind of misses the mark on.

177
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,840
And then, towards the end of the show, I'm going to do it.

178
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,160
I'm going to own up to what I thought

179
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,400
was going to happen in 2015.

180
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,560
We made our predictions of Linux action show up, so 345.

181
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,200
I hope you look this scared during it.

182
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
I know.

183
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,640
And I went through and pulled out

184
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,840
some of the predictions I made, and now I'm

185
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,440
going to play them back and see how I did for 2015.

186
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,960
Yeah.

187
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,080
I just get to watch.

188
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,560
Yeah, it's going to be a little painful for me.

189
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,440
But you know what?

190
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,720
It's on record, so I got to do it.

191
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,520
It's not like I can hide it.

192
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,560
So I'll go through it.

193
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,060
We'll do it.

194
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,040
But, you know, Wes, before we get into all of that stuff,

195
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,520
you and I, just a moment before the lug comes in here,

196
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,000
let's take a moment and talk about this rather outstanding

197
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,800
beer you brought in today.

198
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,480
Oh, do you like it?

199
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,960
I do.

200
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,900
This is like, we're going to call this the beer is tasty

201
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,080
segment, because you brought in a beer last week and this week.

202
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,600
And I think it's worth talking about.

203
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,180
You brought in the Sierra Nevada Celebration.

204
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,800
And it's a fresh, fresh IPA.

205
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,520
And I was looking on Beer Advocate.

206
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,680
It's got a BA score of 93, which is pretty amazing.

207
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,440
6.8% by volume.

208
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,040
Yeah, yeah.

209
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,720
And you know, that 6.8 is kind of high for a beer.

210
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
It's kind of high.

211
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,040
I like a little, you know, the higher.

212
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,440
It's definitely hoppy.

213
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,360
It's pretty good.

214
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,960
So what do you think?

215
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,440
I like it.

216
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,800
I like it.

217
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,720
But you know, it is hoppy, but it

218
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,680
doesn't have too much of the bitter hop finish.

219
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,120
Right.

220
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,560
It has a nice, you know, it's there.

221
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,200
It's tasty, but it's not.

222
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
Yeah, there is a bit of a finish that's like.

223
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:07,920
It's not too cloying.

224
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,280
Yeah, it stays on the tongue, but not too bad.

225
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,600
Yeah, so there you go.

226
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,240
If you're listening to this episode and you have a Sierra,

227
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,200
you should crack one open.

228
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,160
It's a crucial element that makes this show work.

229
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,360
And also makes me a little belchy sometimes.

230
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,480
But I'll try to avoid that.

231
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,480
I got a mute switch right here.

232
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,000
Maybe I can take advantage of that.

233
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,260
Hey, let's get into our updates of the week.

234
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,520
And to do that, let's bring in our virtual log,

235
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,360
time appropriate greetings, Mamba Room.

236
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,120
Hello, world.

237
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,620
Hello.

238
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,120
Hello.

239
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,620
Hello.

240
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,120
Hello.

241
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,760
Hey, everybody.

242
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,160
So it's here, the final episode of The World Without Linux

243
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,800
put out by the Linux Foundation.

244
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
It's finally arrived.

245
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,960
And I haven't seen it yet.

246
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,840
I've been saving it.

247
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,720
Oh, I haven't seen it either.

248
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,920
We've watched like three or four of these on the show.

249
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,200
And this is a series to market Linux at the Linux Foundation,

250
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,240
the people behind a lot of great initiatives

251
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,800
and the funders of Linus Torvalds' paycheck and Greg

252
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,960
and others that are super important to Linux kernel.

253
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,680
They have been putting these videos out

254
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,280
to help the average person understand what the world would

255
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,560
be like if Linux didn't exist.

256
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,840
So let's watch it and then do a little Mystery Science Theater

257
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,340
on it.

258
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:12,560
Hello, and welcome home to Freeburger,

259
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,480
where the message of the day is free, blah, blah, blah, blah.

260
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,240
Oh, hey, Annie.

261
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,400
Sam, what's up?

262
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,680
I didn't know you worked here.

263
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,320
Yeah, I started here in 91 just as a hobby.

264
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,800
Nothing professional, but here I still am.

265
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,760
I do it just for fun.

266
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,040
Anyways, what can I get you?

267
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,440
Wow, this menu is huge.

268
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,480
What's good here?

269
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Well, I like the Sloppy Joe Distro, the Pseudo Menudo,

270
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,280
the Wild Cherry Binary, mm, bomb, the Raspberry Pie,

271
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,440
the Soussai Souffle.

272
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,960
Oh, the Helsinki Drinky, you should get that on the side.

273
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,320
And of course, there is the world famous Freeburger

274
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,880
and Kernel Fries.

275
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,520
What are Kernel Fries?

276
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,240
They're just like regular fries, only monolithic.

277
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,640
So where are your ingredients sourced from?

278
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,200
Actually, thousands of chefs from around the world

279
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,080
contribute ingredients and recipes,

280
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,920
so the menu is constantly evolving and getting better.

281
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,000
Oh, you should try the gooey chocolate chip cookie.

282
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,880
It's brand-gnu to the menu.

283
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,400
You mean brand-new?

284
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,480
No, brand-gnu.

285
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,880
What's gnu?

286
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,680
Beats me.

287
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,280
I thought you gnu.

288
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Just kidding.

289
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't know.

290
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,320
They just make me say it.

291
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,080
I'll just have the Freeburger and Kernel Fries.

292
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,240
Oh, and I need that to go.

293
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,720
So you want that in a container?

294
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,800
I guess.

295
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,120
So how much do I owe you?

296
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,760
Nothing.

297
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,280
It's free.

298
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,180
What, seriously?

299
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,680
Yeah.

300
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,560
The owners give everything away for free.

301
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,760
And since so many people around the world contribute,

302
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,040
the recipes are free for everyone to check out, too.

303
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
It's pretty cool.

304
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,400
That's why they call it Freeburger, dude.

305
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,440
Oh, right.

306
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,880
Hey, Linus?

307
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,440
Wait, is it Linus?

308
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
Anyway, I need you to release the Freeburger and Kernel

309
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,000
Fries, and make it snappy.

310
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,480
Users are so demanding.

311
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,000
Hey, that's really him, isn't it?

312
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,280
And it says I'd rather be diving on his shirt.

313
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,760
Hey, world without Linux is hard to imagine.

314
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,160
Thanks to the hundreds of thousands

315
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
of new individuals and companies who support Linux,

316
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,280
we don't have to.

317
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,400
Hashtag world without Linux.

318
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Let's see.

319
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,120
There's also the Bash Sour Mash, the config pig.

320
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,600
Mm, mm, mm.

321
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
There's the shells and cheese.

322
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Echo Prosecco, very smooth.

323
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,100
Wow.

324
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,400
Or you can get the seedy paranoia

325
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,800
with a side of chowing down.

326
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,300
Mm-hmm.

327
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,040
If you're thirsty, there's grep juice.

328
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,320
For sweets, we've got gummy boots, jelly beans,

329
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,800
cinnamon buns, yum extenders, ice cream sandwich,

330
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,240
gingerbread.

331
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,080
You could have some Java with gnome foam, if you're into that.

332
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,360
All right, that was a pretty good one.

333
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,280
That was the best one, wasn't it?

334
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,440
That probably was the best one.

335
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,640
They saved the best for last, and they got a Linus.

336
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,440
I wonder, though.

337
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I feel like a lot of those jokes you'd already

338
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,480
have to know and like Linux to understand.

339
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,280
That doesn't seem like a world without Linux, did it?

340
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,120
Well, or at least it doesn't mark as well.

341
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,840
Look at you calling out the premise.

342
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,000
I mean, I'm glad they're making it.

343
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,680
I like the catchy music.

344
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,000
You're right.

345
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,280
That was playing to the base, wasn't it?

346
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,200
Right, which is fine.

347
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,840
I feel played, too, which makes me feel good.

348
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,320
But I don't think I could show that to my parents.

349
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,600
Java with gnome foam could be a title, Jumba.

350
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,880
You should bang suggest that.

351
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,840
I don't know.

352
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,960
What do you guys think in the Mumble Room?

353
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,600
That was a valiant effort, right?

354
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,040
I think they did pretty good.

355
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,920
And I'm imagining how they did this,

356
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,080
and I think it was probably a worthwhile effort.

357
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,680
Yeah, definitely appeals to the Linux old school, doesn't it?

358
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,200
Yeah.

359
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
Right.

360
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,200
I think it's the least worst one so far.

361
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,560
Yeah.

362
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,520
That's kind of you.

363
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,560
Reminds me of watching a Quentin Tarantino movie

364
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,320
for all the references.

365
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Oh, just in the sense of making callback references,

366
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,400
or in the sense of Kill Bill cutting off heads?

367
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,320
Oh, OK.

368
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,560
All right.

369
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,760
Yeah, OK.

370
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,080
Yeah, iMacon doesn't like it.

371
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,360
You guys are a bunch of critics.

372
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,040
You know, the Linux crowd is a hard crowd.

373
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,520
It's a hard crowd.

374
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,880
We're not a nice community.

375
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,320
Oh, yes, we are.

376
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,820
We are.

377
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,760
In fact, if you want to prove it, just attend scale.

378
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,000
You'll actually see how nice we are.

379
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,600
It's just we're much nicer in person,

380
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,160
and that's the truth of it.

381
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,920
So we're going to scale, and I'm crapping my pants

382
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,440
as I talk about this.

383
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,600
It is not something I intended to do.

384
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,880
Damn it, Chris.

385
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,240
And I know, I'm sorry about that.

386
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,000
It's kind of smelly.

387
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,880
I have to be here for the rest of the show.

388
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,360
Go on.

389
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,560
You know, I'm not like Mr. Fancy Pants

390
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,160
Popey in the mumble room here, where my company will send me.

391
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,680
You know?

392
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,800
Well, you are your company.

393
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,880
Yeah, exactly.

394
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,080
And I just, the thing is, I have to be there.

395
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,920
I have to go.

396
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,000
And not only because I think it's extremely relevant for two,

397
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,560
at least, of the shows on the network,

398
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,720
if not three shows on the network,

399
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,680
but really, there is something to what Wes just

400
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,080
said, that joke you just made about how we're

401
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,300
kind of a rough community.

402
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,600
I was looking back at some of the stuff

403
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,920
we did to do the last retrospective of 2015,

404
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,040
and it just kept coming up over and over again, like community

405
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,920
drama and community issues.

406
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,840
And then I was doing the retrospective on LUP.

407
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,520
Same thing.

408
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:05,040
All of this crap about how the kernel mailing list is

409
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,160
handling interacting with people.

410
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,120
There was a period of time in the devian community

411
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
during the system D stuff.

412
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,440
Excuse me.

413
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,560
It is like, it is a bad, we have a bad stereotype going now.

414
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,800
It is like, it's kind of getting, it's like,

415
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,160
well, I don't know if I should say this,

416
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,000
but you know how there's communities online that

417
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,880
are known for being kind of a hard community to get into?

418
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,720
That's the Linux community.

419
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
We're that community now.

420
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,720
And it's totally unfounded, because I

421
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,040
think there are legitimate problems like there

422
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,920
are in any large scale community.

423
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,560
FreeBSD.

424
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,640
Some people have a bad time, but that doesn't

425
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,600
mean it's the majority.

426
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Even the gentlemen, as they like to call themselves,

427
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,360
over at FreeBSD are going through this right now.

428
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,240
The FreeBSD Foundation just released a statement

429
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,960
about harassment.

430
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,680
There's back and forth going on.

431
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,000
If you want to follow that drama,

432
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,440
you can try to look into it.

433
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,600
No community is isolated from this,

434
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,200
because these are worldwide communities that are,

435
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,620
it's not just gender issues.

436
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,520
It is complete and different culture issues.

437
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,160
There are different cultures working together

438
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,120
that see things completely differently.

439
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,920
And so there are flare ups that happen.

440
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,600
And the thing is they happen out in the public,

441
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,480
because these are open mailing lists, not

442
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,940
behind some closed commercial private meeting

443
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,160
where everybody can yell at each other and nobody ever knows

444
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,080
about it.

445
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,120
I think Greg Cage touched on that very well

446
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,520
in that same retrospective.

447
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:35,800
Yeah.

448
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,440
And that's why I actually chose one of the reasons

449
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,640
I chose that clip, because I felt like it addressed

450
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
that issue at a meta level.

451
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,400
And so I don't know how else to say this,

452
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,760
but if you don't go to these events in person,

453
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,040
you don't get to see the other side of the coin.

454
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,180
You only get to read the online experience, which

455
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,080
is very, very skewed, because there's

456
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,160
some money to be made in the headlines and to generate clicks.

457
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
And people love drama.

458
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,760
Yeah.

459
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,080
So if you can, I really think going to an event like this,

460
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,680
it's a special experience.

461
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,680
There's not a lot of things that,

462
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,160
if you're as passionate about Linux,

463
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,280
even half as passionate about Linux as we are,

464
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,440
and it's something you follow.

465
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,680
You're listening to this show, so you probably are.

466
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,000
It is really a unique and fun experience.

467
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,040
And I think Linux Fest Northwest, I just love it.

468
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,160
It feels organic and genuine, and I've never

469
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,240
been to a scale before.

470
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,400
I've literally been avoiding it for the entire run of the show.

471
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,880
But I'm going to go to my first scale,

472
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,760
and I don't know what it's going to feel like.

473
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,400
I'm going to tell you, but I don't want to get there.

474
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,320
But I don't know yet.

475
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,880
But there are a lot of events that go on in the industry,

476
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,760
and these are some of the events that are really the good ones.

477
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,160
And if you're passionate about Linux,

478
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,040
it's a pretty cool opportunity.

479
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,360
And we have a promo code, last40.

480
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,960
We don't get any kickback for that at all.

481
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,440
There's no financial agreement to offer you that.

482
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,680
It's just they know we're going to be talking about scale,

483
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,260
and they want to get more people there,

484
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,920
and they gave us a promo code, last40.

485
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,520
And I guess I get the distinction

486
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,800
of having sent some people if you use that promo code.

487
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,840
So I guess in that sense, it helps the esteem of the show.

488
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,160
But I don't get any money for it.

489
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,080
Last40, you get a 40% discount, and it's

490
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,840
January 21st to the 24th.

491
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,480
And there's a couple of days there

492
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,440
where Ubicon will be overlapping scale.

493
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,480
It's going to be a track at scale that you can attend.

494
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,360
So you can go to both.

495
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,200
Ubicon's free.

496
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,120
They'd like you to register, though.

497
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,240
We'll have links in the show notes to do that.

498
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,920
And we're planning to do a tentative brunch on Friday.

499
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,120
Brunch, you say?

500
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,460
I do an action power brunch, actually.

501
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,720
I've already set up the meetup,

502
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,140
so we're starting to organize now.

503
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,000
I just kind of plugged in a temporary location,

504
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,280
which may or may not be the final location.

505
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,440
So if you want to join us,

506
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,840
go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

507
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
Here's why.

508
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,240
This is why we're doing this.

509
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,020
There's only going to be a short period of time

510
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,340
where both Noah and I are at scale.

511
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,440
I'm coming in to cover Ubicon

512
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
and the first couple of days of scale,

513
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,800
and then I'm leaving on Friday.

514
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,040
And I'm going to try like hell to get back here by Sunday.

515
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,960
I don't know if it's possible.

516
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm going to try.

517
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,640
That is a mad dash.

518
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,460
It might not work.

519
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,680
I don't know what's going to happen.

520
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,800
So I'm going to try to get back here by Sunday

521
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,000
and do last from here with Noah doing it live from scale.

522
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,060
So Noah's going to be there from Friday to Sunday

523
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,280
to cover the latter half.

524
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,840
And I think it's going to be big on the weekend.

525
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,360
But the only day both Noah and I are going to be there

526
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,520
is Friday so far, as is planned.

527
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,940
So we're scheduling a meetup

528
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,120
in the kind of morning before scale really kicks off.

529
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,600
The idea being people always got stuff going on

530
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,440
in the evening.

531
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,280
Right.

532
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,800
So anyways, and I'm going to be leaving.

533
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,440
So I just put the meetup link in the chatroom.

534
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,400
It's also in the show notes.

535
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,640
And Mr. Popey, rumor has it there's also

536
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,640
kind of like a little gathering before Ubicon

537
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,120
that kicks off on Wednesday.

538
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,420
Do you know anything about that?

539
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,260
Maybe.

540
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,320
I've kind of messed up.

541
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,520
I'm getting out there really early.

542
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,400
I'm getting on the, I think I'm leaving here on the 18th.

543
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,600
So I'm going to be there around and about like a tourist.

544
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,440
On Tuesday.

545
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,280
Yeah, I think so.

546
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,120
Yeah.

547
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,360
So I may or may not.

548
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,200
So here's what I'm planning to do

549
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,000
is I'm planning to leave on the 16th

550
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,080
and take one of the most beautiful drives

551
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,440
in the United States of America is Highway 101

552
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,200
because from Washington to California,

553
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,880
it's the coast the entire way.

554
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
Highly recommend.

555
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,560
Yeah, and I've just been,

556
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,400
I've been reading people talking about it on blogs.

557
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,240
They're just raving about it.

558
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,080
It's beautiful.

559
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
Yeah, and lots of like really nice,

560
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,000
you know, small towns and stuff like that.

561
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,440
So I'm planning to take that drive down to California.

562
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,680
So we'll get some more Rover log.

563
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,160
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

564
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,260
And I'll probably arrive on the night

565
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,280
of the 19th or the 20th, I'm not sure.

566
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,240
I'm not quite sure when I'll arrive

567
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,680
because I'm going to take my time getting down there.

568
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,280
And then I'm going to haul balls getting back.

569
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,120
So.

570
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,240
I mean, you've seen it all before.

571
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,080
Yeah, yeah.

572
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,980
So I'd love to have you guys at the,

573
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,300
anybody that's attending, you too, Popey,

574
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,140
anybody who's attending,

575
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,800
I'd love to have you at the brunch if you can make it.

576
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,920
And we may change all the details.

577
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,880
All the details may change depending on Noah's flight

578
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,920
because he hasn't locked in flights yet

579
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,640
because his wife's birthday is right in there.

580
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,900
But right now it's tentatively scheduled

581
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,760
for Friday the 22nd at 9.30 a.m.

582
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,240
And I just figured we'd do lunch at a cafe right by the,

583
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,200
look, I found a nice cafe right by the event center,

584
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,180
the convention center.

585
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,440
But if people have a better suggestion

586
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,320
that are more familiar with the area, I'm all ears.

587
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,980
So there is a Linux action show subreddit thread

588
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,400
where we're already organizing.

589
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,680
And P4P3R has been kicking ass.

590
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,200
He's been updating it with new details as I release them.

591
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,400
So hopefully he'll update the post

592
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,460
with a link to the meetup.

593
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,080
I would prefer that this be where the discussion is had.

594
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,920
I don't really check the meetup forms very often

595
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,320
because honestly I got to check all these different places

596
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,160
and I'm driving.

597
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,980
So it's not super convenient

598
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,600
to check the crappy meetup page.

599
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,080
So we can organize and discuss right here in the subreddit.

600
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,680
And this is a great thread that's already going.

601
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,960
And if you can attend, just join the meetup.

602
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,840
Otherwise, you get to just watch from afar

603
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,200
as we kill ourselves to get this content to you.

604
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,460
Hey, you know what I should do is I should mention

605
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,720
we have a shirt that we're selling.

606
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,240
Teespring, it's funny, you see I didn't even plan for this,

607
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,560
but teespring.com slash last400.

608
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,160
You're a natural seller, Chris.

609
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,240
Well, it's because this whole scale event

610
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,240
is, well, I mean, really, to be honest with you,

611
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,460
is sort of at the worst time ever

612
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,240
because not only did Christmas just finish up

613
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,580
and not only is my daughter's birthday today,

614
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,020
but on a personal side, I'm just finishing up a divorce,

615
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,120
which-

616
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,080
I've heard those make you more wealthy.

617
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,320
Is that accurate, Chris?

618
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,260
Because I have three kids

619
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,940
and they're staying with Ange in that house,

620
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,600
I'm giving them everything.

621
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,080
So I'm moving out on my own

622
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,640
and I literally am buying everything

623
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,400
from toothbrushes on up.

624
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,680
And so I can't really personally afford to finance this.

625
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,960
Traditionally in the past, whatever the gap is,

626
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,520
I just pay for it personally,

627
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,360
is how I've done it for 10 years now.

628
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,080
I can't really afford to do that anymore

629
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,920
and not for a while.

630
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,360
So the idea is we have a couple of things

631
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,200
that are coming up.

632
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,640
I'd love to celebrate last400 at that power brunch we have.

633
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
I'd love to have cameras there.

634
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,180
I'd love to be able to afford to bring the gear there

635
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,020
to record it.

636
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,940
But in order to just get to scale,

637
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,960
we're gonna need to get funding.

638
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,240
And then to be able to do something like last400 video.

639
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,120
I wanna make a video for last400 while we're all at scale.

640
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,200
That's my intention.

641
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,840
And I would like to get all of that funded

642
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,400
as much as we can without it going on my credit card.

643
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,240
That's the base.

644
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,320
I mean, I'm just being 100% honest with you.

645
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,280
The idea was this is something

646
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,560
that we recognize we wanna do.

647
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,460
And I believe there is long-term value

648
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,240
to the open source community by going there

649
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,680
and documenting it the way that our shows do it.

650
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,760
So I think there is value to the open source community

651
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,280
and I think it's also value to the show

652
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,160
to make the show something

653
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,320
that continues to be relevant

654
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,320
and covers relevant Linux things.

655
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,740
And so at the end of it all is what I wanted to do

656
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,840
was once again, when we can, have you guys help us out

657
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,260
but also get something in the process.

658
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,880
And these are all very nice items.

659
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,040
They're not cheap.

660
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,080
We don't make a huge margin on them.

661
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,560
The quality is very good.

662
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,160
We've worked with Teespring now for years.

663
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,480
So we have a relationship with them

664
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,640
that allows us to call them up and say,

665
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,600
hey, this doesn't work for us.

666
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,520
You've gotta fix this.

667
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,260
And they've been very responsive.

668
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,580
I really like the spot we're in now

669
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,560
because now we're able to really do some great stuff.

670
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,480
The one thing we don't have the leverage to do,

671
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,680
which means the guys in the EU get a better deal,

672
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,760
is over at teespring.com slash last400EU.

673
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,640
We have a t-shirt, we have a hoodie,

674
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,360
but they also have a tote bag.

675
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,760
Oh, I want that tote bag.

676
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,600
I think I'm gonna buy one.

677
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,440
Maybe two. I am.

678
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,560
I actually told Ansh today to get me

679
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,400
like three different ones

680
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,980
cause you know, we can order from the EU,

681
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,320
we just have to pay more in shipping.

682
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,160
Right.

683
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
So, but the EU guys don't have to.

684
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,040
So at teespring.com slash last400EU,

685
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,260
you get the EU shipping,

686
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,100
cause they have a different,

687
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,800
they have a different, like,

688
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,160
they set up another shop over there,

689
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,560
so they do the printing locally.

690
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,920
Right.

691
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,760
Tote bag.

692
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,680
Tote bag at conferences is a no brainer.

693
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,800
It's a no brainer.

694
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,480
So that is, we are like,

695
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,080
you need to bring that to the US.

696
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,760
So we've been talking to them,

697
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,940
but they're like, yeah, we can't do it for this campaign.

698
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,180
Anyways, I would love to get your support,

699
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,280
and I'd like you to get something too.

700
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,240
These shirts are great.

701
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,080
These hoodies are killer.

702
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
We have a bunch of different colors.

703
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,320
You got the ladies fitted tee.

704
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,000
And what we're gonna do is,

705
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,160
so right now we've probably sold 26 or so,

706
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,760
and a few other on the EU side.

707
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,560
We're getting close to covering the gas to get down there,

708
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,380
which is great.

709
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,220
Right.

710
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,360
You know, but we're not really covering any shipping

711
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,320
to get the equipment, the big equipment from NOAA,

712
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,120
and we're not really covering anything

713
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,520
to really do at the party.

714
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,240
But we're getting close to covering the gas,

715
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,800
which is great.

716
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,000
But we definitely are not there,

717
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,480
so we could use a lot more support.

718
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
And, you know, really, I appreciate the fact

719
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,040
that I can just sit here and tell you guys,

720
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,880
honestly, why I'm doing it.

721
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,160
I hope that you understand that,

722
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,480
from a business standpoint,

723
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,100
this is sort of our best way to keep doing this

724
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:36,100
in a way that allows us to sustainably produce these shows.

725
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,920
Because if I overextend for events as they come up,

726
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,800
that's not a sustainable approach.

727
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,740
You could put the network in jeopardy.

728
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,580
Yeah.

729
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,360
But at the same time, I also,

730
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,760
and I am willing to consider,

731
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,920
I am definitely willing to,

732
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,400
and this is not like you have to do this or else,

733
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,960
I am willing to consider that maybe the better option is

734
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,400
to go to a commercial sponsor

735
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,160
and have them just sponsor the hell out of an event.

736
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,680
But I don't know.

737
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,760
I don't know if it is or not,

738
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,960
and I'm willing to experiment with it,

739
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,180
but I also really like the idea of,

740
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,720
as best we can, crowdsourcing it,

741
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,640
because not only does that save me time

742
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,300
when having to line up deals,

743
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,880
but it also just sort of lets you guys know

744
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,120
I'm going there really for you

745
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,980
not to go promote somebody else.

746
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,280
Anyways, teespring.com slash last 400,

747
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,200
or patreon.com slash today.

748
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,040
And don't forget meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

749
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,440
for the meetup.

750
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,000
And I got a link to the Ubicon stuff

751
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,360
where they say Wednesday, January 20th,

752
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,560
one night before the event,

753
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,240
there'll be a meeting around 1900

754
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,540
for an informal gathering to get to know each other.

755
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,080
And I have a link to the whole Ubicon conference schedule

756
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,840
in the show notes if you guys are gonna be able to attend

757
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,680
both.

758
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,880
And it looks like there's gonna be a Thursday night party.

759
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,160
Which I don't know if I'm registered for.

760
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,300
Poppy, you and I need to talk.

761
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,580
Maybe you can get me in contact with somebody,

762
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,360
make sure I'm already in for all this stuff, okay?

763
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Cause I wanna go to that Thursday party.

764
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,640
Maybe after the show you and I can little wink-wink.

765
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,160
That's nice.

766
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,520
A party, that sounds good.

767
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,760
Get drunk with Mark Shuttleworth, right?

768
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,720
Yep. Right.

769
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,880
Plus you know- Body shots, I think that's-

770
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,720
Plus you know,

771
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,440
Poppy's drinking that watered down beer over there.

772
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,240
So when you're here drinking the Sierra,

773
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,160
the Sierra, what is it here?

774
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,200
The- Celebration.

775
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,040
Yeah, yeah.

776
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,760
Yeah, you know he's gonna get a little tipsy.

777
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,200
So you're gonna have to coax me off of dry January first,

778
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,160
which won't be that hard to be honest.

779
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,120
Dry January?

780
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,960
Tell us more.

781
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,200
Have you never heard of this?

782
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,400
Oh, it's just like, you know,

783
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,040
stop drinking for a month after the excess of Christmas.

784
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,120
Oh, really?

785
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,000
Oh, well I don't think that'll be too hard.

786
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,840
No, it won't.

787
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,680
It really won't.

788
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,480
It doesn't count if you're in another country.

789
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,260
Yeah, first of all, it's a way different area code.

790
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,440
So that doesn't count.

791
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,760
And second of all, it's like the end of January.

792
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,180
So it's, you pretty much did it.

793
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,640
Just have to make sure nobody tells my wife, all right?

794
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,800
No problem.

795
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,520
As long as she doesn't listen to the show, we're good.

796
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,320
Which I think we're probably good.

797
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,840
Everyone tweet at the real Popey.

798
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,760
I thought you had to drink to recover from Christmas

799
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,720
and the time you spent with the family and everything.

800
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,920
Popey, alls you have to do is just think of a line

801
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,760
that the wife will buy.

802
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,600
I don't know if she has any anti-American sentiment in her,

803
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,160
but just say, honey,

804
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,960
I was down there around all those Yankees.

805
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,400
It was just the worst.

806
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,120
They smell bad.

807
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,600
They don't drink any tea.

808
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,680
And they drive on the wrong side of the road

809
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,760
like a bunch of assholes.

810
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,240
I needed something to soothe my nerves.

811
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,080
And then she doesn't-

812
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,640
Have you been listening in to my conversations

813
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,480
with my wife?

814
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,440
That's exactly what I would say.

815
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,640
So there you go.

816
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,360
So you just say you got problem solved.

817
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,480
I'm a problem solver.

818
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,680
People ought to consult me for relationship counseling

819
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,520
as somebody who's going through divorce.

820
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,780
I think I could make some money at that.

821
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,920
Let me tell you something.

822
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,400
All right, let me tell you another way.

823
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,640
Maybe it's not the counseling.

824
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,120
Here's a way you could save some money.

825
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,400
Switch to Ting.

826
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,800
That would probably be a better way.

827
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,120
Maybe my counseling skills should wait

828
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,360
and you should just switch to Ting.

829
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,400
And this would be a good time to do it

830
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,240
at the beginning of the year.

831
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,520
Linux.ting.com.

832
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,480
That's where you go to support this here show.

833
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,040
Also get yourself a discount off some Ting gear,

834
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,720
which is all unlocked and you own.

835
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,120
Or get a credit if you bring a device.

836
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,380
And they have a lot of devices

837
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,440
because they have a CDMA and GSM network

838
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,760
that you get to pick from.

839
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,320
And some of these devices like the Nexus Eye devices

840
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,580
and some of the nicer ones,

841
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,920
they have the capability of running on CDMA or GSM.

842
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,320
Now that's cool.

843
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,360
Now you can get kinda picky.

844
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,480
Now you can sort of say, well,

845
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,000
I mean, for me, when I'm out in the Rover

846
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,520
and I go somewhere over the weekend,

847
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,280
sometimes I have better CDMA coverage

848
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,640
and sometimes I have better GSM coverage.

849
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,160
It just depends on the location.

850
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,800
So I can be kinda savvy about that.

851
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,480
And Ting has an incredible dashboard

852
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,160
that lets you manage all of this stuff.

853
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,220
It works on all of your devices.

854
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,680
But it's actually good.

855
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,320
It's actually useful.

856
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,860
I don't really know how else to describe it.

857
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,600
It is, you know, you can go in there

858
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,280
and you can set nicknames for your devices.

859
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,660
You can go in there and set alerts

860
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,680
and you can set maximum thresholds.

861
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:51,280
You can turn off individual level services

862
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,560
that allows you to really get granular control

863
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,200
over your account.

864
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,800
You can do things like transfer to another line

865
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,140
from the control panel itself.

866
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,720
You don't even have to call customer service.

867
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,800
But it's not to get you to avoid using customer service

868
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,400
because they have fanatical customer service

869
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,160
that sticks with you until the problem is solved.

870
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,180
So it's a really nice setup.

871
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,120
So go to linux.ting.com to see more.

872
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,400
They have great devices at great prices.

873
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,480
And they also have a great blog.

874
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,600
We covered this in Linux Action Show this Sunday.

875
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,560
Kyra just posted her top five apps

876
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
over the last 12 months.

877
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,400
Pretty good video.

878
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,160
And they also have done some recent holiday cord cutter

879
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,320
posts that are really useful if you need to cut the cord.

880
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,200
And they've also even got the sports.

881
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,760
Which I know, Wes, you're a big sports guy.

882
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,600
You're a huge.

883
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,520
It's hard to find those college football.

884
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,080
Playoff games on the internet.

885
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:45,920
Sports ball.

886
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,040
You know, I actually got a couple good ideas

887
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,960
from reading the blog post even though I'm not a sports guy.

888
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,000
Because I just am really interested in getting live TV

889
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,160
on the internet and things like that.

890
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,000
And that was actually, it was a good post.

891
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,440
IPTV the future.

892
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

893
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,520
You know, Ting really seems like they're made up

894
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,620
of people like us.

895
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,460
They really are.

896
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,280
They really are.

897
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,120
Which is awesome.

898
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,960
It is kind of cool.

899
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,720
And you know, so because they're owned by Two Cows,

900
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,880
which has been around forever,

901
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,640
and they're like one of the original internet companies

902
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,040
that figured out how to survive the dot com boom

903
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,860
and do things right.

904
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,840
So there's certain things that they just really,

905
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,360
like they just follow by law.

906
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,960
It's just like their own personal law.

907
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,160
Linux.ting.com.

908
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,840
Go there, support the show and get $25

909
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,480
off your first unlocked device and go own it.

910
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,380
Linux.ting.com.

911
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,320
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

912
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,160
I love it.

913
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,720
All right, Ryan, I hope you are back here, sir.

914
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,120
Because I would love to talk to you

915
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,360
about what's going on at the MyCraft project.

916
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,720
Ryan?

917
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,040
Did he make it back?

918
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,120
No.

919
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,240
Oh yeah, oh sorry.

920
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,080
There you go.

921
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,720
Okay, Ryan, go ahead.

922
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,120
Well, I'm here and I've got a lot to talk about.

923
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,200
Well, now hold on, let's tease it a little bit.

924
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,840
So Ryan emails me and we're talking back and forth

925
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,600
about a couple things that you guys probably hear about

926
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,160
more down the road.

927
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,400
And there was a tease that there might be something

928
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,200
landing that people, a tangible thing people

929
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,960
can go get their hands on online and look at

930
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
and sort of maybe even contribute to.

931
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,800
I don't wanna say anymore.

932
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,640
I'm excited already.

933
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,040
But I'm just saying something interesting

934
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,680
could be dropping very soon from the MyCraft project.

935
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,500
You think I have teased properly, Ryan?

936
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,340
Yeah, that's perfect.

937
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,600
Okay, so what's going on?

938
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Tomorrow at three o'clock PM, central standard time.

939
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I don't know what it is in UTC.

940
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,440
Ha ha ha.

941
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,280
Okay.

942
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,880
We are releasing the Adapt Intent Parser.

943
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,720
Hey!

944
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,960
Which is our software library that we use

945
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,040
to convert natural language into machine

946
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,680
readable data structures.

947
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,840
So what that means, yeah.

948
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,240
So it's the Intent Parser you said?

949
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,080
Yeah, that's right.

950
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,900
Okay.

951
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,520
And this is kind of some of the secret sauce of MyCraft.

952
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,480
So we're really releasing probably one of our

953
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,640
most powerful tools right out of the gate.

954
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,560
That's high.

955
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,440
Ryan, I might have you check your input a little bit

956
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,240
because you're clipping a little bit.

957
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,200
I think this sounds like, and I'm gonna ask you

958
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,080
if I'm right or not, but this sounds like this is

959
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,120
sort of like the critical decision maker piece

960
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,800
that once I've been given input, I have to decide

961
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,100
what the intent of that input was.

962
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,480
Are they looking to do a thing?

963
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,720
Are they asking about a thing?

964
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,920
Do I have that right?

965
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,060
That's exactly correct.

966
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,400
What it does is it looks at your sentence or your query

967
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,400
and parses it and it decides what the person is trying to do

968
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,200
and then turns it into an action.

969
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,480
Or turns it into at least a JSON little data set

970
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,320
that an application can use to take an action.

971
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,920
That kind of seems like that's a core thing

972
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,920
that makes Siri and Google Now useful is they know

973
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,840
when I say, what's the weather like today?

974
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,760
They're able to grab the context out of that and say,

975
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,680
well today is this, like they get the intent

976
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,880
of what I'm doing, like that seems like the thing

977
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,040
that makes these things actually smart.

978
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,880
Yeah, that's right.

979
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,800
And since we had, actually when we began

980
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,120
after the Kickstarter, we had received a lot of attention.

981
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,120
And Josh and I, the founders had, we had a,

982
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,620
what we call Mycroft Legacy now.

983
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,080
And we were using a variety of tools

984
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,760
in order to perform this action.

985
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,760
And then Sean Fitzgerald, who was formerly

986
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,040
one of the developers at Siri and on the Amazon Echo,

987
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,880
came over and he brought this with him.

988
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,720
Oh wow.

989
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,680
An earlier version of this.

990
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,560
And he was like, hey, I've been working on this,

991
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,800
I was gonna open source it, but it seemed like

992
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,720
it would be a good fit for your guys' project

993
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,200
considering I had spoken on multiple occasions

994
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,440
about wishing that I didn't have to rely on outside APIs

995
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,120
to do this type of task.

996
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,160
Ah, so this is huge in the sense too

997
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,120
that you're now less reliant on third-party services?

998
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,960
Yeah, that's right.

999
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,040
And so we immediately, once I realized

1000
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,240
what he'd brought with him, I was like,

1001
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,080
we need to put some resources into this

1002
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
and get this as polished as we can

1003
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,840
and then share it with the world.

1004
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,840
And so we've put some polish on it.

1005
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,040
It's still early days, but our release is in July

1006
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,800
of everything.

1007
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,800
And so we're just opening it up now

1008
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,760
so the community can get in there and hack it

1009
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,240
and use it for other things other than

1010
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,480
what we've used it for.

1011
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,440
I actually got some ideas laid out here

1012
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,160
because I wanted to share them with your audience

1013
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,320
because I'm really excited for people to use it.

1014
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,720
Yeah.

1015
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,920
What is, could you tell us what's the license gonna be?

1016
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,000
What is it written in?

1017
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,840
Oh yeah.

1018
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,040
It's gonna be, it's Python, it's all written in Python.

1019
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:19,880
Oh great.

1020
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,880
It's being released under the LGPL version three.

1021
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,320
Wow.

1022
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,920
We were originally going to release it

1023
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,960
under the GPL version three,

1024
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,560
but we realized that some people wouldn't be able

1025
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,400
to use it in their applications

1026
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,560
because of the nature of the GPL.

1027
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,240
So the one limited sort of negated that.

1028
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,080
Yeah.

1029
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,840
And so the LGPL can be used with other licenses

1030
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,020
a lot easier.

1031
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,520
And that was a conversation that I had

1032
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,120
with the community on mostly on Google Plus.

1033
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,600
I just asked, I was like, hey,

1034
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,840
we're gonna release this new project.

1035
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,960
I want to know what you guys think we should release it

1036
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,200
under and the overwhelmingly they said LGPL.

1037
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,880
So not to get too down into the weeds, Ryan,

1038
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,440
but does this intent parser kick in before

1039
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,200
or after a call out to a remote service?

1040
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,580
Where is this fall in sort of the decision chain

1041
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,180
that a MyCraft device follows?

1042
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,960
So right now what happens is it kind of depends

1043
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,040
on the device because adapt sometimes has to live

1044
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,800
on our servers with our testing with really small

1045
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,560
embedded devices that don't have any processing,

1046
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,040
real processing power on board, but it's super lightweight.

1047
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,040
We've run it on the original Raspberry Pi and the B plus.

1048
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,340
And it was just fine.

1049
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,280
It was fast and responsive.

1050
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,360
And it lives on our current MyCraft stack.

1051
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,880
If you're using the embedded device,

1052
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,400
so if you're using the MyCraft unit

1053
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,800
that we raise money for in the Kickstarter,

1054
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,720
it actually does live locally.

1055
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,720
So the query goes out, the STT,

1056
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,520
whatever we're using for STT in this case would be with AI

1057
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,520
or Google STT would come back with the text.

1058
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,200
So what you said, and then the adapt intent parser

1059
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,260
sitting on the unit would look at it

1060
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,200
and turn it into actionable data,

1061
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,840
which then MyCraft would take the next action,

1062
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,700
whether that be calling out to an API to get the weather

1063
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,280
or casting something to the Chromecast.

1064
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,280
So now this piece is sort of been pre-developed.

1065
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,080
Are you concerned at all about anybody

1066
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,200
that's gonna claim things like intellectual property patents

1067
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,040
or anything like that?

1068
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,000
Is this a minefield for you guys?

1069
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,800
Or are you feeling safe?

1070
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,240
We're feeling pretty safe.

1071
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,080
It's a different approach than...

1072
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,960
So there's two things.

1073
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,840
There's nothing like this out there

1074
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,040
that's open source right now,

1075
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,040
which is just a giant hole that's missing in the world.

1076
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,960
And it could be used for so many other things

1077
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,160
than what we're using it for, like chat bots, IRC bots.

1078
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,240
I actually keep thinking of studio automation tasks

1079
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,520
that I could use.

1080
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,520
And robots and video games.

1081
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,840
Video games would be so cool

1082
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,640
if you could type something to a character

1083
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,640
and have them understand your intent, or like a phone system

1084
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,800
or analysis of large amounts of data.

1085
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,280
Like if you were analyzing a whole bunch of tweets,

1086
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,360
this could pick out.

1087
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,760
Really?

1088
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,040
Various things about what they're doing and things like that.

1089
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,520
You mean there's wide applications

1090
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,560
outside of even AI devices like this?

1091
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,800
You mean there could be server-side

1092
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,160
background analysis applications for something like this?

1093
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,080
That's exactly right.

1094
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,840
And to answer your question,

1095
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,040
because I kind of sidestepped there,

1096
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,840
we're not worried about copyright infringing

1097
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,680
or anything like that,

1098
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,560
because we kind of have so many people now from backgrounds

1099
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,240
who have worked on projects like this before

1100
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,160
that a lot of people say that our approach

1101
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,400
is a lot different than those of the other existing companies

1102
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,440
and that they don't think that it's really necessarily

1103
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,400
going to be a problem.

1104
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,240
But we'll see.

1105
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,080
I mean, we'll see.

1106
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,440
It seems like, it seems,

1107
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,640
one of the things, Ryan,

1108
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,000
that has always struck me about these personal assistants,

1109
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,080
be it Amazon Echo and today,

1110
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,120
I talked about it in Tech Talk today, Ford announced,

1111
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,620
they're looking to integrate with the Amazon Echo,

1112
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,660
so that way you can give it commands from your car.

1113
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,640
It seems like what you really need for these things

1114
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,640
to ever be useful is ubiquity.

1115
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,220
So like I would need one in my home,

1116
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,480
I would need one in my office,

1117
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,640
I might need one in my car,

1118
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,400
and I would maybe need one in different areas of my house.

1119
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,720
And I think the only way to truly make that possible

1120
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,660
is to have the device be different types of devices

1121
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,600
for different scenarios.

1122
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,160
Maybe in my studio, it's all running on a computer.

1123
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,580
Maybe in my RV, it's on a little Mycroft appliance box,

1124
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,520
and in my kitchen, it's a Mycroft appliance box.

1125
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,160
But maybe in my studio,

1126
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,440
it's something that's on just a Raspberry Pi

1127
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,840
that I've implemented myself.

1128
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,060
It seems like the ability to have the stuff behind this,

1129
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,720
the open source software behind this,

1130
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,940
run on a server in a different form of implementation,

1131
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,480
actually gives the possibility of true ubiquity

1132
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,080
in this kind of artificial assistant.

1133
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,000
So I don't have to have just my phone.

1134
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,720
I don't have to have just the Mycroft device.

1135
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,520
I don't have to be in just this room.

1136
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,640
And if I have even a little a DIY inspiration,

1137
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,560
I could roll it myself,

1138
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,560
or somebody could make a product that does it.

1139
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,360
I could even have it running on my server

1140
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,640
that's checking my email in some degree.

1141
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,640
It seems to me that open source isn't just a licensing thing,

1142
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,480
but it actually makes like this truly

1143
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,480
an Internet of Things capable device or set of software.

1144
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,640
Yeah, you nailed it on the head.

1145
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,040
The idea where a lot of people are too siloed

1146
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,800
and they're thinking about what this type of technology means

1147
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,460
and where it's going to live.

1148
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,720
Mycroft, the thing that I keep saying in interviews

1149
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,400
is Mycroft is not just going to live on the Mycroft unit.

1150
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,280
Mycroft in the world that we envision lives on the computer,

1151
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,280
it lives on the phone, it lives on the freaking dishwasher.

1152
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,240
Maybe it's on a droplet working on something I gave it.

1153
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,080
Yeah, exactly.

1154
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,740
And these parts, and the thing that was the most frustrating

1155
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,480
when we took up this task was none of this was there.

1156
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,480
There were some projects that were kind of, you know,

1157
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,960
tackling maybe a little bit of one part of what we're doing.

1158
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,360
But the thing is, in order for us to actually make a dent

1159
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,440
and compete with the proprietary applications

1160
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,320
that are coming out, we have to,

1161
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,800
we've found ourselves having to tackle various parts

1162
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,080
of this project, which is fine.

1163
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,240
They need to be tackled.

1164
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,720
And so this is one part, you know, the adapt engine

1165
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,560
is one part.

1166
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,540
So I guess in day to day, here's to bring it all

1167
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,360
to a sort of like a point, a relevant point,

1168
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,840
is I could see myself having a Mycroft AI unit

1169
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,280
in my kitchen and then I go upstairs to work in my office

1170
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,640
and instead of having another hardware that I spent 100

1171
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,560
or 200 or whatever it is, I have Mycroft on the desktop.

1172
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,640
And it also is using my desktop mic and it is also aware

1173
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,940
of the same things my kitchen version is,

1174
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,120
but in the kitchen I have in a self-contained appliance unit

1175
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,240
and up in my office where I have my nice powerful desktop,

1176
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,560
I'm just running the Mycroft software.

1177
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,380
Does that seem like a feasible implementation to you?

1178
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,220
Yes, it does.

1179
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,560
In fact, I'm running it on my desktop right now.

1180
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,000
Yes, earlier.

1181
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,320
What else can you tell us about that?

1182
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,760
Well, we did release a video just a couple days ago

1183
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,640
about Mycroft on the desktop.

1184
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,040
But the other thing is, I, yesterday,

1185
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,320
or was it the day before, I don't know,

1186
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,600
Aaron's sitting next to me, he knows, I'm sure,

1187
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,720
I launched every application I could on my computer

1188
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,440
via Mycroft and my fan was kicking up

1189
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,840
and making all sorts of noise

1190
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,240
because I didn't close any of them,

1191
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,720
I just kept asking him to open more and more and more.

1192
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,720
And it was crazy what accuracy was and I realized,

1193
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,200
yes, you could just go and pick through your applications

1194
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,200
and open that random one, but it is so convenient.

1195
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,440
Are you using Mycroft on an Oryx Pro?

1196
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,440
There is, yeah, there's an Oryx Pro next to me

1197
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,280
that has it on it.

1198
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,160
What's a mitochondria?

1199
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,020
Mitochondria, an organelle containing enzymes

1200
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,760
responsible for producing energy.

1201
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,960
Hey Mycroft, what is 31 divided by six?

1202
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,360
5.16 repeating.

1203
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,520
It kind of sounds like Wimpy.

1204
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,520
Are you telling me, are you telling me

1205
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,120
that System76 gave you Oryx Pros for this video?

1206
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,200
Are you telling me that?

1207
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,640
Because I wanted an Oryx Pro real bad.

1208
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,440
They didn't give us one.

1209
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,280
You bought it?

1210
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,200
That's Aaron's, yeah.

1211
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,160
They're always, okay.

1212
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,640
I got back from System76 and I was talking about

1213
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,800
what the nice build quality was and everything

1214
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,080
and he broke down and bought it and a frenzy.

1215
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,320
I want one so bad I was about to get super jelly

1216
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,360
because you know what, I got to say,

1217
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,800
I want to be first in line if they're giving them away.

1218
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,080
All right.

1219
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,200
I want to say one thing about the Oryx Pro real quick.

1220
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,440
Okay.

1221
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,120
The keyboard on that is the best keyboard I've ever used.

1222
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
Yeah.

1223
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,360
I just put, yeah, I got to use it for one night

1224
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,200
and I fell in love.

1225
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,880
So I'm inferring from the video here

1226
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,840
that this is a working thing.

1227
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,320
Is this something I can get my hands on yet?

1228
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,600
Not yet, April.

1229
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,360
April is when, I mean, you,

1230
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,280
maybe we can work something out, but.

1231
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,640
But like I keep saying, we're really just trying

1232
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,840
to ensure that our first,

1233
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,200
each of these projects around Mycroft,

1234
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,040
we're trying to make as solid as possible

1235
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,040
before we release it to be contributed to

1236
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,160
because part of that is not does this run well,

1237
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,960
but it's how, what's the,

1238
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,680
what's it look like when someone wants to contribute

1239
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,960
back to this project?

1240
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,760
Are they able to do that in an easy way?

1241
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,600
Are they able to, do they have the documentation they need?

1242
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,880
Do they have the tools they need in order to develop for it?

1243
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,920
And so people just want me,

1244
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,720
a lot of people ask me like to just throw everything

1245
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,920
out there in one big release party,

1246
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,920
but I'm like, if I throw it out there

1247
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,640
without enough documentation,

1248
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,760
this is actually a problem that people aren't used

1249
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,640
to dealing with this artificial intelligence

1250
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,640
or in the event of like natural language processing.

1251
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,640
And so I've tried, I've set people in front of it

1252
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,920
and said like, hey, look at this.

1253
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,680
And they're like, I'm not familiar with any of these terms.

1254
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,240
I don't know how any of this works.

1255
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,200
And it's because we're used to creating applications

1256
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,200
where you point and grunt.

1257
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,680
You know, you're not used to parsing what people say

1258
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,200
and turning that into actionable.

1259
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,040
Is this your way of letting me know

1260
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,060
that you're not gonna bring a demo unit to scale?

1261
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,360
I am bringing a demo unit to scale.

1262
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,480
Oh, all right, nice.

1263
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,560
Yes, I was hoping so, I wanna see it.

1264
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,360
Yeah, I've heard you're giving out demos

1265
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,720
and I'm hoping to see one at scale.

1266
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,600
Watch Chris's hands, he will steal it.

1267
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,780
Ryan, what is your hope?

1268
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,000
I mean, aren't you at least a little concerned

1269
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,740
that the noise of the convention floor

1270
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,540
will make the audio interaction impossible with the thing?

1271
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:28,540
So I'm concerned about that, but I'm also planning on,

1272
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,020
I already talked to Jono

1273
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,240
cause I gave him a demo earlier today.

1274
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,760
And we talked about stealing a side room

1275
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,880
in order to show people so that we weren't,

1276
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,400
cause yes, just like when you're talking to a person,

1277
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,960
if lots of people are yelling around it,

1278
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,120
sometimes it picks you up, sometimes it's like hey,

1279
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:46,960
I don't know what you said.

1280
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,800
That's gotta be the worst case scenario

1281
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,360
is a convention floor for a device.

1282
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,440
So if it even works at all,

1283
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,440
then you're probably good.

1284
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,480
Make sure you grab me or Noah

1285
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,120
and let's get a little video of it

1286
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,280
cause that'd be amazing when we're down there.

1287
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,120
So Ryan, what else do we need to talk about today?

1288
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,960
Cause I feel like there's other things,

1289
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,600
but I don't, nothing comes to the top of my head.

1290
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,440
Well, I just really wanna remind people

1291
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,120
that what's coming out tomorrow, Adapt and Temp Parcer,

1292
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,360
and we are so excited to see

1293
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,040
what people will be using Adapt for,

1294
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,320
what ideas they have,

1295
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,600
where right now I've been spending all day

1296
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,000
working on the documentation,

1297
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,520
trying to make it as easy as possible

1298
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,280
for people to get up and use it for something.

1299
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,080
And this, if you start with this

1300
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,160
and you really gain an understanding of this,

1301
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,760
you'll be able to, on day one,

1302
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,440
probably write various skills from Mycroft.

1303
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,200
So it's not a waste of time to pop in

1304
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,400
and learn a little bit about this.

1305
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,080
And what I want to see

1306
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,440
are really, really intelligent IRC bots.

1307
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,520
Like that seems like a perfect match for this.

1308
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,520
It does, it really does.

1309
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,360
And JBot gets an upgrade in 2016.

1310
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,880
Yeah, and you know, like I said,

1311
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,200
robots would be a really good match for this.

1312
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,200
And video games, video games are the clearest one to me

1313
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,400
because you could have characters who understand

1314
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,320
the simplest of phrases.

1315
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,480
This very well may be the originator

1316
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,720
of the intended parser for the frickin' holodeck.

1317
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,560
Yeah. That could be, right?

1318
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,640
Oh, I know what we should talk about, Chris.

1319
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,480
Yeah.

1320
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,600
And I haven't committed to this, but-

1321
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,440
It's in the back of your mind,

1322
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,760
something you got kicking around?

1323
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,160
Yeah, I keep, I shouldn't commit to things on here.

1324
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,080
No, this isn't a commitment.

1325
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,920
This is a brainstorming session.

1326
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,880
Oh, a brainstorming session.

1327
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,320
So I told Chris this so everybody knows,

1328
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,960
that we should totally pimp the RV with Mycroft units.

1329
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,800
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1330
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,000
The Rover's gotta be upgraded with Mycroft AI.

1331
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,920
I'm not kidding, that's gotta happen.

1332
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,760
I just don't-

1333
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,280
Not just one, not just one.

1334
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,720
You don't want the unit at the front of the RV.

1335
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,440
No, you gotta have one in the back

1336
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,040
where the business is too, because-

1337
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,080
In the bathroom too.

1338
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,640
Oh, oh yeah, yeah.

1339
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,480
Just everywhere.

1340
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,320
That's a good point.

1341
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,860
You basically nailed the three sound isolation zones

1342
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,800
where I would need mic coverage.

1343
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,400
Yeah, yeah.

1344
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,240
So can you hook Mycroft up to accelerometers

1345
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,080
and things like that?

1346
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,600
So it can say to Chris in the middle of the night,

1347
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,920
stay calm, it's just an earthquake.

1348
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,080
Well, you know, this is something

1349
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:18,280
that we don't talk about enough anymore,

1350
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,720
but remember the actual units themselves

1351
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,640
are with the exception of the Raspberry Pi,

1352
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,080
which, you know, some people are like,

1353
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:25,920
that's not open hardware,

1354
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,440
but the unit itself is completely open.

1355
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,960
You can pop it open, there's a Raspberry Pi in there,

1356
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,760
and there's an Arduinos, and there's, you know,

1357
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,260
everything's exposed, all the ports are exposed.

1358
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,200
So you can hack on it if you want to

1359
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,600
and add whatever it is that you-

1360
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,920
That actually in the rover could be a useful feature.

1361
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,600
That could be a very useful feature.

1362
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,520
Somebody asked in chat, and I just wanted to tell them,

1363
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,440
you do not need a Mycroft unit

1364
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,740
in order to use Mycroft on the desktop.

1365
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,920
Right.

1366
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,760
Yeah, but I would still encourage anybody

1367
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,840
who's been on the edge to order a Mycroft unit

1368
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,920
because it supports the development effort.

1369
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,760
Yeah.

1370
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:11,760
But no, you know, anyone who has the ability

1371
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,880
to install Debian packages should be able

1372
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,320
to run Mycroft on their desktop.

1373
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,160
Cool.

1374
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,220
Now, Wimby usually had a question, go ahead.

1375
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:25,360
Yeah, we've obviously heard quite a lot about Mycroft

1376
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,080
over the last sort of six to nine months.

1377
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:30,720
I was just curious how much time you'd been working on it

1378
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,420
prior to the Kickstarter.

1379
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,280
I started working on Mycroft.

1380
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:41,280
Mycroft probably was born in January of 2015.

1381
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,540
I think that sounds right.

1382
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:49,540
And then that was Josh Montgomery, the CEO, at the time.

1383
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,600
Him and I, I actually hung out at his makerspace

1384
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:58,600
and what had happened is he'd seen a really simple AI

1385
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,380
at another makerspace.

1386
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,700
It was all like, you just said a specific word

1387
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:08,160
and it just had a pre-selected action that it took.

1388
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,160
And so we started geeking out about geek things.

1389
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,500
And he started telling me about this

1390
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,580
and we were like, you know, maybe we can make this.

1391
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,000
That would be so awesome if the makerspace

1392
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
that we hang out in had this in every room

1393
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,800
and you could say like, hey, Mycroft, where's this?

1394
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,760
Do this, play this music.

1395
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,300
And so it was originally named Scarlett, though,

1396
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,680
after Scarlett Johansson.

1397
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,040
Now I'm in love.

1398
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,560
Now you've sold me.

1399
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,660
And then over time, when we started playing

1400
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,740
with our early code, we were like,

1401
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,080
this is actually really awesome.

1402
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,300
We should make a product out of this.

1403
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,000
And that's where that was kind of born.

1404
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,040
So I got on around March or April.

1405
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,800
And so it's been worked on since January, 2015.

1406
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,280
And then the Kickstarter was, of course,

1407
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,960
I think around September.

1408
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,400
I kind of, that was so,

1409
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,920
there was so much going on at that point with Mycroft

1410
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:11,040
that my mind has kind of like blocked out all of that.

1411
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:15,000
But yeah, anybody who thinks you just throw up

1412
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,820
a Kickstarter and money rolls in is just wrong.

1413
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:19,660
Anyway.

1414
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,360
Are you saying the device was inspired by the movie Her?

1415
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,840
No, not necessarily.

1416
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,800
Have you seen that movie, the AI,

1417
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,380
voiced by Scarlett Johansson?

1418
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,200
It was inspired by many things.

1419
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,660
Yeah, I know, I'm just teasing.

1420
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,560
Well, you know the namesake, right?

1421
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,400
Of Mycroft?

1422
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,240
No, I don't.

1423
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,600
Oh, you did, I think you told me, but I don't remember.

1424
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,040
It's named after the AI in The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.

1425
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:42,960
Right, okay.

1426
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,080
It's also the name of Sherlock Holmes' brother, but.

1427
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,680
Yeah, right, right, right.

1428
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,720
Anyway, but yeah, so yeah, we've been working on it for,

1429
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,220
well, it's January now, so a full year.

1430
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,720
That's remarkable progress.

1431
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,120
Yeah, it's actually pretty neat to see.

1432
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,600
Yeah, really good momentum.

1433
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,400
Yeah, and I mean, especially if you're ready

1434
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,320
to show a device at scale.

1435
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,160
That's pretty cool.

1436
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,520
I'm excited to see that footage.

1437
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,840
Yeah, yeah, I'm really excited to share it, you know.

1438
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,600
So where do I go right now?

1439
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,360
I know I go to Mycroft AI for the project

1440
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,840
but if I wanted to jump in with the funding,

1441
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,600
where else could I go?

1442
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,760
Let me post a link.

1443
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,400
It's Indiegogo, you can pre-order on Indiegogo.

1444
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,680
They have a nice pre-order system.

1445
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,040
I'm gonna post a link in the chat.

1446
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,880
Sure.

1447
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,720
And if you can post it in the show notes,

1448
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,560
that would be awesome.

1449
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:30,880
No problemo.

1450
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,220
Yeah, I think this is really neat

1451
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:33,840
and one of the things I like about it is,

1452
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,840
I would like to have a hardware device.

1453
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,680
I genuinely think that's neat.

1454
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,840
But I also love the idea of just turning

1455
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,640
all of my Linux desktops into something

1456
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,160
that contributes to this thing.

1457
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,440
Like if they could all be tied into the same

1458
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,080
information sources and I have the same

1459
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,800
kind of functionality on my desktop

1460
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,040
that I could have and say my kitchen

1461
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,680
or the rover would really be pretty unique.

1462
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,020
And like VR and other things that are really

1463
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,440
kind of developing right now,

1464
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,960
I would love to see Linux really have

1465
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,120
something here for this.

1466
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:06,040
And what Mycroft to me, in my estimation,

1467
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,520
is it's putting us kind of ahead

1468
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,500
of the overall competition.

1469
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,040
Because the competition can't offer

1470
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,720
what Mycroft can offer and it's powered by Linux.

1471
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,480
So this is the one to get behind in my opinion.

1472
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,680
Yeah, and let me tell you guys

1473
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,640
something that's really exciting.

1474
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:24,640
I, we updated, so everything that Mycroft can do

1475
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,800
is called a skill.

1476
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,520
And we updated our skill framework right before Christmas.

1477
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,800
And so on December 24th, we're getting ready

1478
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,640
to head up to my parents' house

1479
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,960
and I've got the Mycroft code base open

1480
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,600
and I said I'm just going to see with the new,

1481
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,360
because it looked really simple, the new skill framework.

1482
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:47,600
I'm like, I'm going to see how quickly I can create a skill.

1483
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,440
I created a skill in 15 minutes.

1484
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,360
And that was with me having not touched the skill,

1485
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:54,640
the new skill framework.

1486
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,400
Like I'm granted, I'm somewhat familiar with, you know,

1487
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,360
how these things are developed and everything.

1488
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,580
But Sean and Jonathan, two of our developers,

1489
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,000
had really headed up the new skill framework.

1490
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,840
And I just sat down, looked at another skill

1491
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,060
that was based on the new framework

1492
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,440
and wrote one in 15 minutes.

1493
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,280
That's great.

1494
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,000
It was a Pokedex.

1495
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,720
So if any of you have played Pokemon,

1496
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,640
you could say like, what does a Pokedex say

1497
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,600
about this Pokemon and it would tell you.

1498
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,760
And so it seemed like an easy target.

1499
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,920
And so, and I was going up to visit

1500
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,920
my little brother-in-law, he's like 13.

1501
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,760
And so it was nice to be able to show him that.

1502
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,480
But just when I did that, I thought,

1503
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,640
holy crap, like that my own,

1504
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,960
like our own project surprised me.

1505
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,520
Cause I thought if I could do this in 15 minutes,

1506
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,560
people can do amazing things.

1507
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,160
There's so much out there that can be done.

1508
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,840
And that's why we're so excited.

1509
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,760
We're trying to get this stuff ready as quickly

1510
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,660
as we can to get it out there and get people,

1511
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,360
you know, having fun with it.

1512
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,880
It's probably worth mentioning too.

1513
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,200
If you go to the Indiegogo page,

1514
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,400
you can also just get in,

1515
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,480
you can just chip in at five bucks or 10 bucks.

1516
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,000
You know, you get a sticker, 30 bucks

1517
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,680
and you get the dev kit.

1518
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,040
You don't have to go all the way in.

1519
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,640
If you can't afford to get a hardware device,

1520
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,960
but you still think this is a great idea,

1521
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,640
there's a $5 and $10 and $35 or $30.

1522
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,240
We don't want the open source desktop to be,

1523
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,160
you know, left in the wayside with Cortana and Siri.

1524
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,560
Yeah, screw Cortana, screw Cortana.

1525
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,400
Yeah, really.

1526
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,840
Can I share something else that was really awesome?

1527
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,320
There's so much, I just need like,

1528
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,200
we need a Mycroft action show, but anyway.

1529
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,640
We very well might one day.

1530
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,600
Yeah, okay.

1531
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,900
So the other thing that we got running really well

1532
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,400
was up until just last week,

1533
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,760
I think of the week before,

1534
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,520
we had run Mycroft on a Ubuntu phone emulator.

1535
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,360
And so we finally got two Ubuntu phones

1536
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,520
and we threw, and we got Mycroft running

1537
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,660
on the Ubuntu phones.

1538
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,680
Cool, wow.

1539
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,940
So I was, but I was getting upset

1540
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:58,440
because I knew it could text

1541
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,800
because the other phone was able to text people

1542
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,080
by saying, hey, Mycroft, text so-and-so, this is awesome.

1543
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,760
You know, text that message to them.

1544
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,600
Yeah.

1545
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,760
So I was sitting there and I was like,

1546
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,060
hey Mycroft, text Aaron, you know, this is awesome.

1547
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,460
And then I didn't do anything and I was like,

1548
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,040
hey Mycroft, text Aaron, this is awesome.

1549
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,360
And so I was getting really pissed.

1550
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,240
And so I looked in the logs and it's like,

1551
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,880
you haven't put any contacts in the phone.

1552
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,040
I don't have anybody named Aaron to send a message to.

1553
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:29,140
And so, but it was, it's just so awesome

1554
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:33,640
that the tech is, it's so awesome using Ubuntu

1555
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:37,280
with like, whether it be on the desktop or on the phone,

1556
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,520
with a personal assistant.

1557
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,440
I mean, it's just.

1558
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,560
Yeah, absolutely.

1559
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,200
It's just, I think that a lot of people

1560
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,880
are going to appreciate having that option

1561
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,900
on the Linux desktop and also having the ability

1562
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,080
to add things that are specific to you.

1563
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,080
Right, and if it got really crazy big one day,

1564
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,840
so you know, somebody could make an Android app,

1565
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,560
somebody could, you know, I mean,

1566
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,960
it could be on all the platforms.

1567
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,000
Yeah, Aaron's writing an in-map skill.

1568
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,600
Nice, there you go.

1569
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,920
So I think Northranger sort of summarizes it a lot.

1570
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,920
And it really, for me, Northranger, I don't know about you,

1571
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,720
but it comes down to the fact that

1572
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,820
Mycroft doesn't have sort of an overall

1573
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:23,720
multinational corporate strategy tax,

1574
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,200
where Cortana has the tax of whatever Microsoft

1575
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,520
intends to do with their Bing and Azure

1576
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,120
and the entire Microsoft Windows ecosystem.

1577
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,520
And Google obviously wants to keep using Google search.

1578
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,000
They want to be able to mine your data for advertising.

1579
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,680
Siri locks you into the Apple platform.

1580
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,400
Mycroft doesn't have that baggage.

1581
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,200
And I don't know about you, Northranger,

1582
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,160
but I think that's maybe its most attractive feature.

1583
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,800
What do you think?

1584
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,720
I totally agree.

1585
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,240
Having something that both individuals

1586
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,960
who'd want to add their own skills, you know,

1587
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:59,160
and it's attractive, Mycroft is an attractive system

1588
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,920
for that, and you know, if it takes off,

1589
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,320
I'd love to see, you know, outside companies,

1590
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,000
you know, publishing their own Mycroft skills,

1591
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,280
you know, and not have to feel like they're giving away

1592
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,560
their secret sauce to Google or Amazon or whoever.

1593
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,800
Yeah, exactly.

1594
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,160
Em Hall wants help, Ryan, installing it at scale.

1595
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,040
So you're gonna be doing a little tech support

1596
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,960
while you're down at scale with Mr. Hall.

1597
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,160
That sounds good.

1598
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:29,840
Yeah, so anyway, keep your eyes peeled

1599
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,000
for Adapt getting released tomorrow.

1600
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,280
If you are not already following us on Twitter,

1601
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,920
it's at Mycroft underscore AI.

1602
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,280
And if you're on Google+, it's plus Mycroft A dot I.

1603
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,120
Yeah.

1604
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,480
And you can find us.

1605
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,840
If you search, you can find us,

1606
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,040
and maybe we can get into the show notes.

1607
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,360
Yep, yep, I'll have it linked.

1608
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,880
I'll have that linked up in the show notes for you

1609
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,080
because I think it's worth checking out.

1610
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,880
And you know, Ryan, I really appreciate you

1611
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,720
coming on the show and sharing this with us.

1612
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,040
It is extremely fascinating to follow this

1613
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,760
as you're working on it, so it really means a lot

1614
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,360
to come in and chat about it with us.

1615
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,560
I love coming in, chatting about this stuff.

1616
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,400
Well, thank you, sir.

1617
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,240
So thanks.

1618
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,160
Stick around if you want to,

1619
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,920
because after I go through and own up

1620
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,520
to my 2015 predictions later on in the show,

1621
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,440
I'm gonna open up the floor to some predictions,

1622
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,280
and I'd like to hear some of yours.

1623
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,920
So stick around if you can.

1624
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,080
And before we get into the rest of the show,

1625
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,280
I'm gonna take a moment and thank Linux Academy,

1626
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,800
sponsors of the Unplugged show now, for a long time.

1627
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,000
And I think that's because this is an obvious fit.

1628
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:27,840
Right?

1629
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,800
It's kind of a no-brainer, actually.

1630
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,320
This is a resource created for Linux users,

1631
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,980
by Linux users, who give a shit about open source.

1632
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,200
And if that sounds like somebody that

1633
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,100
sort of is in line with the things that you care about,

1634
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,680
that might be why it's such a great fit.

1635
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,320
Maybe that just has something to do with it.

1636
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,000
I don't quite know.

1637
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,280
But go over to LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged

1638
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,680
and take advantage of our discount,

1639
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,560
and go check out the Linux Academy.

1640
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,280
They really, I mean, I joke.

1641
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,760
I'm having fun with you here, but let's be serious.

1642
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,800
This Linux enthusiast got together with educators

1643
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,160
and developers, and they made the Linux Academy platform

1644
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,760
for people who know what Linux is,

1645
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,040
know what all of the different stuff in the stack is

1646
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,680
that you need to learn, and they know they needed

1647
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,620
a good place to go to learn it

1648
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,000
from people who actually care.

1649
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,760
So they've got over 2,000 video courses you can take,

1650
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,440
with instructor help when you need it,

1651
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:14,400
downloadable comprehensive study guides,

1652
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,640
seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from.

1653
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,000
It automatically adjusts the courseware

1654
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,400
and the virtual machines that you can SSH into

1655
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,920
from your favorite SSH client and do it like a boost,

1656
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,280
which is nice, right in with your existing workflow.

1657
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,360
They have the entire AWS stack.

1658
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,800
If you want to get into the Red Hat certified courseware,

1659
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,740
they've got that.

1660
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:36,040
If you want to learn the Ubuntu LAMP stack,

1661
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,020
they've got that.

1662
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,760
If you want to go into NGINX or Python or Ruby,

1663
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,560
if you want to go into Android development,

1664
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,120
if you want to go into virtualization

1665
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,040
and containerization, they have all of it.

1666
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,160
This is something that they've been really good at

1667
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,480
is they watch what's going on

1668
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,640
because they're into it just like we are,

1669
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,080
and then they pull the trigger on the stuff

1670
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,360
they know that's really gonna be the long-term stuff

1671
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,420
that's gonna add value to your life to learn.

1672
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,720
They have scenario-based labs

1673
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,420
so you get real hands-on experience.

1674
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:02,880
So you're actually working with the stuff

1675
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,080
so when you go to do it in person,

1676
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,320
it's not the first time you've ever done it.

1677
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,120
When you're actually doing it, getting paid for it,

1678
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,800
gives you that kind of confidence in their lab servers.

1679
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,240
And then they have that instructor help.

1680
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:18,160
That to me, that to me seems like the big differentiator.

1681
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,640
Because these topics are not like learning After Effects

1682
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,120
where there's tens and thousands of After Effects guys

1683
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,880
out there that they could go contract.

1684
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:30,400
It's not tightening the bolts on your sink

1685
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,240
that there's tons and tons and tons of ways

1686
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,040
to get instructions and help on that

1687
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,000
with experts that can help you.

1688
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,840
It is working with a Red Hat server.

1689
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,380
It's setting up AWS and working with S3.

1690
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,960
These are a little more esoteric,

1691
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,080
more complicated types of questions,

1692
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,760
and they have instructor help when you need it.

1693
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,640
They have graded server exercises.

1694
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,720
You log into a lab, you perform a specific task,

1695
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,680
and then they'll automatically grade your actions

1696
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,800
so you can see how well you did.

1697
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,440
This is really nice.

1698
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,280
Talk about the kind of experience you get

1699
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,200
from something like that.

1700
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,960
And remember, it's choosing from the distro

1701
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,480
that you've selected.

1702
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:04,320
That's pretty cool too.

1703
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,960
And imagine the amount of work they have to do

1704
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,160
to make that work.

1705
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,200
That's the thing.

1706
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,640
That's the thing that we thought about doing

1707
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,740
for How To Linux and we're like,

1708
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,280
whoo, we don't have a staff of a bajillion.

1709
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,160
We could never do it.

1710
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,120
You have to pick one.

1711
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,240
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1712
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,080
Go check them out.

1713
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,280
They just recently revamped

1714
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,440
their backend distribution infrastructure.

1715
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:23,340
Whole new CDN, HTML5 players throughout

1716
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,400
so it works on all your good devices.

1717
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:27,000
It really is a great resource.

1718
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,840
You can support the show

1719
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,080
by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1720
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,080
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring.

1721
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,360
Thank you.

1722
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,640
The unplugged program.

1723
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,760
Okay, Wes, so every year this guy comes along now

1724
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,160
with his big old list of crap that don't work

1725
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,280
on the Linux desktop,

1726
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:46,240
and this is the major Linux problems for 2016 edition.

1727
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,700
And this is as put a regularly updated article

1728
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,000
of all of the things that are wrong

1729
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,360
with Linux distributions.

1730
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,720
Now, Wes, did you get a chance by any chance

1731
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,440
to go through this long list of items?

1732
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,880
And did you get a sense of this person's intent

1733
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,660
when you went through this list?

1734
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,920
Yes, I think the intent is good.

1735
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,320
I think it's a helpful catalog.

1736
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,240
I think there are some items

1737
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,560
where it reads more emotionally

1738
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:17,460
or more heat of the moment than it could.

1739
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,080
I think there are some items that are either dated

1740
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,660
or I think a lot of it also draws attention

1741
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,760
to this fails in some cases.

1742
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,240
And it's important that we note that, right?

1743
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,360
Because any failure is important,

1744
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,380
but it also kind of I think highlights some things

1745
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,200
where it's like, well, you may have that problem,

1746
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,560
but 90% of people do not.

1747
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,240
I think what it really lacks is a real sense

1748
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,080
of any statistics and the larger context.

1749
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:44,000
Do you have a sense if this person is experienced

1750
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,800
with Linux or with other operating systems?

1751
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,840
Do you have a sense if they have a good technical capability?

1752
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,480
Yes, I would say it sounds like someone

1753
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,640
who's been in the trenches using a Linux desktop

1754
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,000
for a long time and continues to do so.

1755
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,720
I know a lot of people who have jumped that ship,

1756
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,520
now they're on the Mac, now they use Windows

1757
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,600
because they have games.

1758
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,080
This person sounds like someone who's put up with a lot

1759
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,080
and who's run the full gamut of working or not.

1760
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,860
He says here, I want to make one thing crystal clear,

1761
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,120
Windows in some regards is even worse than Linux

1762
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,120
and it's definitely not ready for the desktop either.

1763
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:15,120
Right, and I think a lot of these too are

1764
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,760
how you define that ready for the desktop

1765
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,860
because there's some of these where it's like,

1766
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,680
well, if ready for the desktop is you need it

1767
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,120
to work reliably, 100% production machine

1768
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,480
with this specific equipment, maybe it won't.

1769
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,000
Is it ready for your grandmother's computer

1770
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,920
to browse the web and write up a word,

1771
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,600
you know, or maybe it is.

1772
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,160
Right, and those are two different interpretations

1773
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:34,000
of the desktop.

1774
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:34,820
So here's where he starts.

1775
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:37,040
Open source Nvidia driver is much slower,

1776
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,480
up to five times than its proprietary counterpart

1777
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,000
due to improperly working power management

1778
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,600
and the AMD and Intel graphic drivers

1779
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,160
can significantly be slower than the proprietary

1780
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,000
counterparts.

1781
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,920
This is a huge issue, he says.

1782
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,720
And I think this is a prime example

1783
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,320
of what you were just saying.

1784
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,720
Those of us that would be using, in my estimation,

1785
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,400
the open source Nvidia driver could give really

1786
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,920
no crap about the performance.

1787
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,040
We just really want to be able to hook up a projector

1788
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,640
or hook up an external monitor, hook up our TV

1789
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,460
or just run our single monitor

1790
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,920
and as long as the windows render properly

1791
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,920
and if there is some sort of desktop effect,

1792
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,900
it is within appropriate response time,

1793
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,920
they're happy, that's the baseline,

1794
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,760
all they need from the open source driver.

1795
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,740
Those of us who want every bit of performance

1796
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:22,000
out of our GPU we can, we're already compelled

1797
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,600
to run the proprietary driver for other reasons.

1798
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,360
So this right off the surface is,

1799
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,160
it's not taking into context this complaint.

1800
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,640
And I would also, I could take a moment

1801
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,760
and mention that the graphic situation

1802
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,640
is not necessarily much better on the Mac.

1803
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:40,640
The Mac has horrible GPU drivers.

1804
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,120
So.

1805
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,380
And in some cases the open source,

1806
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,540
like I know the open source AMD graphics,

1807
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,800
while they may not be great currently for 3D,

1808
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,840
the 2D stuff is great,

1809
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,660
they support multiple monitors flawlessly.

1810
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,160
So I think his first complaint sort of puts it

1811
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,200
in the context of what you're saying

1812
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,960
with the overall issue we take with the article

1813
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,880
is it sort of, it blurs the lines

1814
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,460
between different use cases and it just tries to take,

1815
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,040
Linux is a very flexible operating system

1816
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,200
that can work on a lot of different scenarios

1817
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,760
and some scenarios have different requirements.

1818
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,880
Right, some of those requirements are directly at odds.

1819
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,000
If it works well in one scenario, maybe it can't.

1820
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:11,840
Yeah.

1821
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,200
All right, so Mumble Room, as we go through these,

1822
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,480
feel free to chime in as you like.

1823
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,600
That was our first one.

1824
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,320
But here's some other ones in here that,

1825
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,200
you know what, they ring a little true.

1826
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,400
Let's talk about the audio subsystem.

1827
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,980
Let's start with my favorite one

1828
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:26,400
because it affects the Mumble Room.

1829
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,160
No reliable echo cancellation.

1830
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,160
If you use a normal microphone and speakers,

1831
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,520
in many cases you won't be able to use Skype

1832
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,400
and VoIP services normally.

1833
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,400
Windows, Android, and Mac OS all implemented

1834
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,360
voice cancel echo cancellation on a system level.

1835
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:43,920
There's a solution for pulse audio

1836
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,320
and hopefully be enabled by default in the future.

1837
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,560
This is legitimately something that is kind of

1838
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:49,560
a pain in the ass on Linux.

1839
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,880
Are you familiar with that solution?

1840
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:52,800
I am not.

1841
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,640
I am not.

1842
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,560
The solution is don't use speakers, use headphones.

1843
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,920
That's the solution.

1844
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,120
Because even voice cancellation, echo cancellation

1845
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,080
isn't that great on the other platforms either.

1846
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,880
Just don't use Hangouts or Mumble

1847
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,360
with a microphone and open speakers.

1848
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:08,600
Use a headset or something like that.

1849
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,480
Which is what many professional broadcasters

1850
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,520
would be doing anyway.

1851
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,360
Yeah.

1852
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:14,720
All right, no reliable sound system.

1853
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,640
No reliable unified audio mixing implemented

1854
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,240
in all modern OSes except for Linux.

1855
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:22,200
Many old and or proprietary applications

1856
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,520
still open audio output exclusively,

1857
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,640
causing major user problems and headache.

1858
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,200
Too many layers of abstraction lead to situations

1859
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,480
where the user cannot determine why audio input output

1860
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:32,320
doesn't work.

1861
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,560
Also kernel drivers, also library connected to DMX

1862
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:37,320
connected to the pulse audio server,

1863
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,840
then the also library, then the pulse backend,

1864
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:41,080
then the application.

1865
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,120
That's six layers of redirection.

1866
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,440
And then you add the seventh layer in the case of KDE

1867
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,680
because they have phonon.

1868
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,000
That seventh layer really is killer sometimes too.

1869
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:51,840
Yeah.

1870
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,680
It really is.

1871
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:53,520
That seventh.

1872
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,840
Six seems to work.

1873
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,000
It's like a dip, man.

1874
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,080
The seventh layer dip, nothing bothers my gut

1875
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,200
except for the cheese on the top.

1876
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,200
It's that seventh layer that actually bothers my gut.

1877
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,600
Dammit.

1878
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,640
You know, it's funny because as somebody

1879
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,800
who is sitting in front of two Linux computers right now

1880
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,680
doing an audio podcast,

1881
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:16,000
I'm not really having a lot of audio issues

1882
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,240
with these machines.

1883
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,320
It really is only under KDE that I ever have problems.

1884
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,320
Otherwise I really like pulse audio actually.

1885
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:23,640
Yeah, I used it to as like an RTP source

1886
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,920
to play to some other speakers.

1887
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,760
Yeah.

1888
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,520
And it was two clicks of the config

1889
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,440
and it just was playing.

1890
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,200
So as an end user,

1891
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,200
if you remove Plasma Desktop from the equation,

1892
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,520
I actually don't feel like these are legitimate complaints

1893
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,120
because they're not,

1894
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,920
they don't really impact the end user.

1895
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,960
And there are definitely people

1896
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,800
who have weird pulse situations,

1897
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,880
especially on older districts.

1898
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,400
Yeah, Mumble Room, feel free to disagree.

1899
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,000
But in my estimation,

1900
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,120
this is kind of a non-issue for the average user.

1901
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,720
Unless you got three or four sound cards.

1902
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,560
Or you need it to not be mixed at the end.

1903
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,320
You know, you need direct output to the card.

1904
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,600
Then you might have to do some work around.

1905
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,440
Yeah.

1906
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,280
But for people who just want to listen

1907
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,800
to their YouTube video

1908
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,920
and have it play at the same time as another sound.

1909
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,760
Yeah.

1910
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,600
Works great.

1911
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,420
We got no disagreement from the lug.

1912
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:03,260
So we move on.

1913
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,880
I would say a unified control panel

1914
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,640
for all distros of letters would be better.

1915
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:10,480
Yeah, proof of control.

1916
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,300
Because.

1917
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:12,140
Proof of control.

1918
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:15,600
Because like there's sometimes when we have issues

1919
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,800
staging people and sometimes, you know,

1920
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,080
they don't know their own control panel

1921
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,720
and you're on a different distro

1922
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,960
and then you have to try to find some example.

1923
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:25,800
Yeah, that is.

1924
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,480
And it really doesn't help.

1925
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:28,960
Yeah, that is a good point.

1926
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:29,800
That is a good point.

1927
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:30,760
That is kind of a.

1928
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,320
Even here on my little Mint laptop

1929
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,440
they have a native sound settings.

1930
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,280
You know.

1931
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,100
Yeah.

1932
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:36,940
Cinnamon.

1933
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:37,780
Yeah.

1934
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,600
Which is different than.

1935
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:39,440
Yep.

1936
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,260
I like Pava control more.

1937
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:41,100
Yep.

1938
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:41,940
So that's what I use but.

1939
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:42,760
Yeah, that's a good point.

1940
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:43,600
That is well received.

1941
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,420
Okay, so.

1942
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,940
And I don't really have a response to it

1943
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:50,320
other than it makes remote support scenarios

1944
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,240
a little more difficult.

1945
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:52,800
Right.

1946
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,760
This was a point that he made it

1947
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,640
almost five times in the article over and over again.

1948
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:00,080
And I'm really curious to see what the mumble room

1949
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,040
says about this one.

1950
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:06,080
As he puts it, an insane number of regressions

1951
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,680
in the Linux kernel when with every new Linux kernel release

1952
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,460
hardware can stop working inexplicitly.

1953
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:17,260
Incomplete drivers, playback regressions on audio,

1954
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:18,960
all kinds of problems.

1955
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,360
He points, he pounds this issue

1956
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,040
throughout the entire article.

1957
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,760
Kernel regressions all the time.

1958
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,680
Kernel regressions all the time.

1959
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,280
Insane amounts of bugs introduced

1960
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,700
with every kernel version.

1961
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:35,440
It really happens.

1962
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,280
No, that happens all the time for me.

1963
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,120
All the time.

1964
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:38,940
Really, okay.

1965
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:42,500
In what use case scenario are you experiencing

1966
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,480
regressions all the time?

1967
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,300
Tell me.

1968
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,980
Typically the AMD open source driver

1969
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:48,220
because it seems like they rewrite significant parts of it

1970
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:50,560
every single major release.

1971
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,680
But that's not really the Linux kernel, right?

1972
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:53,960
That's the driver.

1973
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,720
But it's shipped with the kernel, right?

1974
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:57,760
It's the open source driver that ships with the kernel.

1975
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,880
It's a module that ships with it.

1976
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,100
So are most of the other devices

1977
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,120
that he could talk about here.

1978
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:01,960
Okay, all right.

1979
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,440
I think he's, by reading this entire article,

1980
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,020
I grok he's kind of talking about audio devices.

1981
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:08,640
I almost get the sense that he's an audio engineer

1982
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,680
that works with some Linux systems by reading this article

1983
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,720
because he gets into the specifics about the bit rates

1984
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,720
on Linux audio and stuff that I do kind of agree with.

1985
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,960
It seems like you would only know of

1986
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:18,320
unless you professionally work with it.

1987
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,520
And so I could see sound devices breaking on him.

1988
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,780
I guess I was just surprised

1989
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:26,560
because I pretty much, I am running current Linux kernels

1990
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,540
on four out of six machines I use regularly.

1991
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,600
And it also seems like another one where,

1992
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,800
at least the one you were just reading there,

1993
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,280
like if you follow the link,

1994
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,240
it's a DataMation article

1995
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,640
that has some other people talking about a few.

1996
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,480
Yeah, the source is weak.

1997
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,120
Hand-picked quotes from some kernel developers.

1998
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,560
And it doesn't even talk about regressions

1999
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,280
for like the majority of that article.

2000
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,160
So I'm willing to believe that there are regressions,

2001
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,680
but to say that so strongly

2002
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,200
and then not have any sort of like,

2003
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,160
what are the numbers?

2004
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,680
How many companies are affected by it?

2005
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,160
And here's where I think this blog post

2006
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,800
goes way down into the weeds

2007
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,120
because if you just back up for a second,

2008
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,760
you realize that's why there's things like Ubuntu 14.04

2009
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,220
that Mint 17.3 that you are running your laptop on

2010
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:06,860
right now is based on.

2011
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,880
It is not experiencing these regressions

2012
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,480
because this is being managed at the distribution level.

2013
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,820
And if you're in the enterprise

2014
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,200
where these things really matter,

2015
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,080
you're likely running Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

2016
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,960
Ubuntu LTS, or CentOS.

2017
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,360
You also couldn't afford to have QA teams

2018
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,200
that can review these things.

2019
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,080
True, but even if you didn't have a single tester

2020
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,240
before you just randomly installed a kernel update

2021
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,440
on a production machine,

2022
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:30,400
if you're running it in a business scenario,

2023
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,360
in most cases, you're using an LTS-style release.

2024
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,720
Hell, there's even Arch machines have,

2025
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,620
you can have an LTS kernel on an Arch machine.

2026
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:42,400
So this, it feels like a false argument

2027
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,780
because if the scenario in which you are so dependent

2028
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:48,400
on the kernel support of your hardware,

2029
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,760
that scenario is not one in which you would be

2030
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,160
also installing every single kernel update that comes up.

2031
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,080
The two just things are completely incongruent.

2032
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,760
It doesn't match up.

2033
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,580
No, I don't think so.

2034
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,160
I think you should be able to expect Upstream

2035
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,400
does a decent job testing the software they write.

2036
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,800
You shouldn't have to rely on a distribution

2037
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:03,760
to test all your software.

2038
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,200
You shouldn't rely on Red Hat to test that the kernel works.

2039
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:08,040
I agree.

2040
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,280
Because I've had a lot of esoteric hardware

2041
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,240
where it just does not work correctly with a major update.

2042
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,920
And I mean, even on point releases, they break things

2043
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,560
like the ButterFS bug that they introduced

2044
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:19,140
in like 3.19.1 or something that wasn't even in 3.19.0.

2045
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:23,940
Yeah, but my point is that these things do happen.

2046
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:24,960
It is a reality.

2047
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,300
And anybody that is administering these systems

2048
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,520
is aware of the reality because these are people

2049
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,320
that their jobs are on the line for managing these systems.

2050
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,520
And so they have to work in the reality

2051
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,480
of the context of the situation.

2052
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,760
So they're not deploying these kernel updates

2053
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,520
on these massively critical machines.

2054
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,560
It's just not something that's commonly done.

2055
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,560
It's not a shortcoming, right?

2056
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,120
It sucks when you're going to test these things

2057
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,220
and you have to weed through all these weird issues

2058
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:49,060
in your lab. I agree.

2059
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,400
I agree. It sucks.

2060
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,740
It's one of the main points of his articles

2061
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:53,920
as the drawback to Linux.

2062
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,600
I don't think it's a drawback because the fundamental way

2063
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,280
that Linux is deployed and distributed

2064
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,880
is essentially built to mitigate these potential issues.

2065
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:02,920
No, I don't think it's a drawback,

2066
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,600
but I think it's something that needs to be worked on

2067
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,040
because I don't think they do enough regression testing.

2068
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,360
And I think it can be a lot better.

2069
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:09,800
Yeah, I know.

2070
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:10,720
I agree there too.

2071
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,360
But the thing is, that is...

2072
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,200
Well, I mean...

2073
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:15,040
I guess that's what I was saying

2074
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,920
is that there's a lot of nuance there

2075
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,520
that is covered in that point.

2076
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,960
Well, maybe instead of funding a blockchain replacement,

2077
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,960
they should be funding more kernel testing

2078
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,480
over at the Linux Foundation.

2079
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,520
And there's the Hacker News article,

2080
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,640
our discussion, which maybe we should link to.

2081
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,880
They have some good discussions

2082
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:34,320
about what current test frameworks are used by the kernel

2083
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,240
and what they do.

2084
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,120
Anything to jump out at you?

2085
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,960
I just remember seeing a lot of the...

2086
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,040
Because that Hacker News thread

2087
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,120
seemed overly hostile to me.

2088
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,520
There are some hostile sentiments in there for sure.

2089
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,840
There's some nice ones too, but yeah,

2090
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,040
it was just like a whole bunch of people

2091
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,400
like, yeah, that's why I switched to the Mac.

2092
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,640
And I was like, I don't want to read that.

2093
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,760
Just, it's getting disappointing.

2094
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,600
And you know what?

2095
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,660
They're all gonna come back.

2096
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:55,200
They're all, they'll all be back.

2097
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,040
The Mac is...

2098
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:56,860
They switch to the Mac,

2099
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:57,960
but they find they have the same regressions, right?

2100
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,380
Like I think I updated to a minor point release

2101
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,640
on Yosemite or something,

2102
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,400
and my Wi-Fi driver broke pretty horribly.

2103
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:05,240
This Mac, this...

2104
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,520
And this is their hardware.

2105
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,160
This expensive Mac Pro,

2106
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,640
that is not the trashcan model,

2107
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,960
but it was the last one they released before the trashcan.

2108
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:15,800
Right.

2109
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:16,640
It's actually a decent desktop.

2110
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,480
Big metal.

2111
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,300
Kind of sexy.

2112
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,720
The one that actually has PCI Express slots

2113
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,920
that you can use and stuff and drive slides.

2114
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,760
It's kernel panic before the last two Linux unplugs.

2115
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,000
Maybe it's when I come over.

2116
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,760
Alls I'm saying is,

2117
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,760
anybody who actually uses Mac OS X

2118
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,440
under production load,

2119
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:40,360
where your CPUs are running at higher than 70%

2120
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,400
for more than say 90% of the machine's day,

2121
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:46,200
anybody who uses a Mac under those conditions

2122
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,160
knows that it is one of the weakest

2123
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:49,560
operating systems out there.

2124
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,200
It eats itself constantly.

2125
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,660
It has one of the worst file systems

2126
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:56,840
in the history of desktop computing.

2127
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,600
And on top of all of that,

2128
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:02,040
the expensive hardware has such a premium around it

2129
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,400
that all of the accessory manufacturers

2130
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,080
also get to add a premium

2131
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,120
to hook crap up to these expensive machines.

2132
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,120
It is infuriating.

2133
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,880
The Mac platform,

2134
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,420
this is what gets me about this hacker news thread,

2135
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:18,800
and we should link to it now that I'm ranting about this.

2136
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,040
You can go read it and see why I'm ranting about this.

2137
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,960
The arrogance of these people,

2138
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,600
the supposed superiority of their operating system,

2139
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,920
it makes me laugh because it is all about

2140
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,280
what the different work cases

2141
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:34,360
and how there's just simply some tools

2142
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,520
that work for some people better

2143
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,120
and other tools that work for other people better.

2144
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,680
And that's really what it comes down to.

2145
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:41,240
And when you read this guy's article,

2146
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:45,160
every single one of these issues that we highlighted here

2147
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,360
is a use case that is edge.

2148
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:50,080
And there are legitimate ones like Xorg allows applications

2149
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,320
to exclusively grab keyboard and mouse input.

2150
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,760
If such applications misbehave,

2151
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,520
you're left with a system you cannot manage.

2152
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,460
A lot of us have experienced this at some point or another.

2153
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:01,680
But again, it is an edge use case.

2154
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:05,160
And so when I read these things, I read these rants,

2155
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:09,080
I just, I walk away from something that doesn't feel

2156
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,960
productive, it feels more,

2157
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,880
it feels more nitpicky for nitpick's sake.

2158
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,140
What I would like to see from this article in 2017

2159
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:21,980
is a refinement of what we argue about.

2160
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:26,080
Because there are issues in here that, in my case,

2161
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,240
are worth highlighting.

2162
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,120
Like I've run into this one.

2163
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,600
In most cases, kernel crashes are invisible

2164
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,340
if you're running an X session.

2165
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:36,200
Moreover, KMS prevents the kernel from switching

2166
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:39,880
to plain 640 by 480 or 80 by 25 text in VGA mode

2167
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,160
to give you an error message.

2168
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,280
Because KMS is all locked up.

2169
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,880
Very incomplete hardware support for sensors, too.

2170
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,520
Yeah, I've seen that.

2171
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,000
You know, you might have a machine on a modern laptop

2172
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,800
that has 50 sensors.

2173
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:55,400
And HWinfo is only detecting maybe 20 of them,

2174
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,840
maybe 12 of them.

2175
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,560
It's a weak point of Linux.

2176
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,500
Power management.

2177
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,600
This isn't in his article, but Feronix took a look

2178
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,320
at power management for Linux.

2179
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,760
For 2014 versus 2015.

2180
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:10,160
And we are worse at power management at the end of 2015

2181
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,960
than we were at the end of 2014.

2182
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:14,440
We use more battery power.

2183
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,000
So there are obvious areas.

2184
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,160
But what he ends up doing is nitpicking in a way

2185
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:23,080
that feels unproductive and also so esoteric and specific

2186
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,720
that it doesn't feel like there's any action

2187
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,960
that we can take on these.

2188
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:29,920
And I think part of it, too, is where it lacks context.

2189
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:30,800
Like with the regressions.

2190
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,040
Like, regressions are bad, but how do the rates

2191
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,840
of the Linux kernel versus other kernels

2192
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,000
that are updated as much, that make as much project,

2193
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
that support as much new hardware as that does.

2194
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,880
Sure, that's a great question.

2195
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,120
Yeah, yeah, and almost in all of these,

2196
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:49,120
through this whole thing, I have to resist the urge to say,

2197
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,880
well, but Windows does it this way.

2198
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,200
Well, but the Mac does it this way.

2199
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,960
Because there's nothing perfect out there.

2200
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:54,800
Not at all.

2201
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,080
And I think we could all agree that no desktop is perfect.

2202
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,720
And basically, whatever desktop you spend the most time on

2203
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:00,920
sucks.

2204
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,920
And I think this just needs a little bit more context

2205
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,520
so that we, like, a lot of those are completely legitimate

2206
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,080
points that should be fixed.

2207
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:10,280
But we have limited work, you know, hours.

2208
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:13,120
And so I think that maybe this article needs a little bit

2209
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,680
context of which are the most important,

2210
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,560
which one of these should we really be pushing towards

2211
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:18,400
in the next year.

2212
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:19,800
That would be more helpful.

2213
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:24,800
And also, it also needs to not be so contradictory

2214
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
at the top of the article he bangs on about

2215
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
not bringing Android into the equation.

2216
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:31,840
Right.

2217
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:36,600
Then winds on about how Android UI becomes unresponsive

2218
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,840
if you do certain IO intensive operations.

2219
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:40,680
Good point.

2220
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:43,920
It's like, okay, well, you can't say,

2221
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,080
you can't talk about Android as a plus point

2222
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,600
and then draw on it as, by the way, Android.

2223
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,600
Yeah, that's nuts.

2224
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,880
There's another interesting one in here.

2225
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,840
I quite like this one, which I agree with.

2226
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:01,520
Xorg is largely outdated, unsuitable,

2227
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,840
and even terribly insecure for modern PCs and applications.

2228
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,320
And you could change one word in that sentence.

2229
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,960
Windows is largely outdated, unsuitable,

2230
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,280
and even terribly insecure for modern PCs and applications.

2231
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,120
That's true.

2232
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,000
Yeah, that's a good point.

2233
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:20,880
Yeah, you could also say the same about-

2234
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,400
That's comparing the display server

2235
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,200
with fundamentals of the operating system design.

2236
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:26,320
You could also say that about Mac OS X.

2237
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,880
Somebody just ran the numbers, right?

2238
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:31,200
And in 2015, the Mac OS X had the most vulnerabilities

2239
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,080
out of any desktop operating system.

2240
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,200
Now, sure, some of that was open source packages.

2241
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,400
Some of it wasn't.

2242
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,760
But you can pick and choose this data any way you want.

2243
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,640
You could then say the Mac OS

2244
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,640
was the most insecure operating system of 2015.

2245
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,940
It'd be kind of be a bullshit statement,

2246
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:47,080
but you could say that based on the data.

2247
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,800
You could say Xorg's architecture is inherently insecure.

2248
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,640
You could also claim that Windows architecture

2249
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,640
is inherently insecure.

2250
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:56,200
Yeah, that's a great point, Wimpy.

2251
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,120
Did anybody else in the Mamba Room

2252
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,840
have any points they wanted to make from this article

2253
01:19:58,840 --> 01:19:59,720
before we wrap up?

2254
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,280
And we'll have the full thing linked in the show notes

2255
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,200
if you guys at home want to read it.

2256
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,240
Can we not do this one next year?

2257
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,320
Maybe not, you know?

2258
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,840
I kind of like, the thing I like doing is,

2259
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,440
the reason why I like covering it

2260
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:14,180
is this article manages to get quite a bit of traction

2261
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:17,160
online and every year it's gotten more and it's less-

2262
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:20,280
Don't you think that's his agenda though?

2263
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:23,280
Don't you think he just loves trolling the Linux community?

2264
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,240
I mean, some of the hyperlinks in this article

2265
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:30,040
are links to bugs that he's raised on the LKML

2266
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:34,600
and have been closed and then he reopens every year

2267
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,960
and he's beginning to wind up people with every year

2268
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,080
these things being reopened.

2269
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:42,880
So some of his citations are his own bullshit bugs.

2270
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,200
See, this is the inevitable problem,

2271
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:48,080
is as this gets more attention,

2272
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,160
it almost feels like we are ignoring it

2273
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,440
if we don't respond to it because essentially,

2274
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,240
the way it is written and structured,

2275
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:56,780
that almost just gives it credibility

2276
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:57,800
right there unfortunately.

2277
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,320
Like when you read something like this online

2278
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:01,440
and then you see something that's sourced like this,

2279
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,400
you don't even start clicking links,

2280
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,760
you go, oh, this guy's really sourced his stuff,

2281
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,720
he really knows what he's talking about.

2282
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:09,200
And so it generates a 100-common deep hacker news thread

2283
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,960
that's an entire attack on Linux, right?

2284
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,800
And it gets linked all over the hell over Twitter

2285
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,560
and Reddit and Facebook and it starts generating this buzz

2286
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,720
of this is why it's still not the year of the desktop Linux

2287
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:21,240
and then that's the headline that runs it.

2288
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:22,720
It's not the year of the desktop Linux,

2289
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,840
it's got all of these issues and I just feel like...

2290
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,560
And it really hits that crowd of people too

2291
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,520
who use Linux on the server,

2292
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,360
but just don't think that they can use it on the desktop.

2293
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:34,080
And I feel like that rubs at least me

2294
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,000
and some people in our community just like...

2295
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,240
So I kind of feel like it is sort of our duty

2296
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,880
to sort of respond to it and say, no, no,

2297
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,560
this guy's blowing some of these things out of proportion,

2298
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,800
he's citing himself as Wimpy just pointed out,

2299
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,040
he's citing datamation articles

2300
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:50,840
that kind of refer to regressions in the Linux kernel

2301
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,920
and some of these are extremely niche use cases

2302
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,200
that don't affect regular day-to-day users,

2303
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,960
which he's supposedly writing this for.

2304
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,240
So I think that's worth mentioning.

2305
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,000
I don't want to give it necessarily any more credibility

2306
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:03,840
than it deserves though.

2307
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,920
So I don't, like we didn't cover it in last as news,

2308
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:10,000
for example, you know, just as we almost did

2309
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,120
and I thought, eh, we had a discussion behind the scenes

2310
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,240
about running it as news in the Linux action show

2311
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,960
and we decided that this is more of something

2312
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,680
we feel like as a community we should respond to

2313
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,600
in Unplugged and so we moved it down to the Unplugged show

2314
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,240
in the sense of, not to demote the status of it,

2315
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,200
but just to recognize what it really is.

2316
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,120
Right.

2317
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,120
It's really kind of a conversation piece.

2318
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:36,760
I actually feel like it's a more honest Linux sucks.

2319
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,300
Blaster Sissy feels like it's a less honest,

2320
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,760
I feel like it's a more because it is at least,

2321
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:44,240
it is appropriately updated and it is also cited,

2322
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:45,400
which is really nice.

2323
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,840
Yeah, there's a difference.

2324
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,460
The siting often is himself or the animation articles,

2325
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:51,120
but the siting is done.

2326
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,760
So it seems like it's sort of, it's a different spin

2327
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:55,800
on that sort of this is what's wrong

2328
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,120
and that's what plays well on the internet.

2329
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,100
Right.

2330
01:22:59,100 --> 01:22:59,940
And I think.

2331
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:03,180
I think it's at all ironic that that website

2332
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,980
is running on Linux.

2333
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,840
Well, the guy obviously uses Linux, right?

2334
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:07,720
I mean, you read the article,

2335
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,080
the guy obviously is a Linux user, that's the thing.

2336
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:14,400
And so these continue to generate discussion

2337
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:17,360
and he managed this year and last year

2338
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:20,080
to get a hell of a lot of traffic to discuss it.

2339
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:22,320
So yeah, I find it to be fascinating.

2340
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:26,260
I find it to be fascinating because it is like,

2341
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:28,360
geeks can argue about this kind of thing forever.

2342
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:31,480
The edge cases are, I guess, where all of the discussion is.

2343
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,200
And it's a lot of work, but you find these articles,

2344
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,280
it really gets your blood boiling

2345
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,660
and you know you're engaged and it's like,

2346
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:36,680
you have to put in some thought,

2347
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:37,700
like why is that so wrong?

2348
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:40,420
Well, like the stuff, like I think his PowerPoint,

2349
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:45,420
or his PowerPoint, I think his PowerPoints were really,

2350
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,080
where he goes into Xorg.

2351
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:48,920
Right.

2352
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:49,760
That is kind of Xorg.

2353
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:50,920
We all acknowledge that.

2354
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,200
Yeah, and then at the same time we all know

2355
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:56,220
we've got our solutions in the works too, so.

2356
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:57,780
And he harps on Flash.

2357
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:58,620
Right.

2358
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,020
It is kind of getting tiring, actually,

2359
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:01,120
now that I think about it.

2360
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,720
It is, the whole thing is just getting kind of old.

2361
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:06,360
And it's getting less and less relevant

2362
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:09,080
as the strategy tax of the big platforms

2363
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,160
becomes more and more apparent on the Mac and Windows.

2364
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:12,000
Right.

2365
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,640
So yeah, maybe next year we don't cover it.

2366
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,480
I don't know.

2367
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,300
Let's hope we don't even have to.

2368
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:20,000
Yeah, it does feel like it's sort of,

2369
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,640
it does feel like it's something of a bygone era.

2370
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,880
I'll tell you what's not of a bygone era,

2371
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,120
that's our friends over at DigitalOcean.

2372
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:27,320
Head over to DigitalOcean.com

2373
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,480
and get yourself a Linux rig up on their awesome servers,

2374
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:31,840
all running KVM, sitting on top of Linux boxes

2375
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:35,400
with SSD drives, 40 gigabit E connectors,

2376
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,260
and guess what, a $10 promo code

2377
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:40,480
when you use DO Unplugged, one word, lowercase.

2378
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,680
One word, lowercase, that'll get you hooked up

2379
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,160
over at DigitalOcean for two months

2380
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,400
to try out their $5 rig.

2381
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,960
You can get started in less than 55 seconds.

2382
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,320
And at $5 a month, you get 512 megabytes of RAM,

2383
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,480
a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte.

2384
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,320
Did you see my old terabyte dance I just did there?

2385
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,680
That was a beautiful dance.

2386
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,280
That's my terabyte transfer dance.

2387
01:24:58,280 --> 01:24:59,120
That's a big deal.

2388
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,920
Do the terabyte transfer.

2389
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,760
There you go, I just did it again.

2390
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:06,440
You get a terabyte of transfer with a $5 rig,

2391
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,600
it just, I just don't even.

2392
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,440
That's insane.

2393
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,440
That's great, I just, as somebody who used to have

2394
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,840
to do coload servers, I just, that really blows my mind.

2395
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,600
And they got data center locations in New York,

2396
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:16,760
San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London,

2397
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:20,160
Germany, and Toronto, so you can go have your server

2398
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,960
chill with Alan Jude.

2399
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:22,800
Hey hey.

2400
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,120
Yeah, Netflix and chill with Alan Jude.

2401
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,080
That's what I hear you do up in Toronto.

2402
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,440
They have a great interface, it's very simple and intuitive.

2403
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,320
And that's kind of my nice way of saying it's better

2404
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,680
than any other virtualization management platform.

2405
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:36,220
Way, way better than anything VMware could ever dream of,

2406
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:37,640
which is pathetic.

2407
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:39,840
It is really good.

2408
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,640
It's better than any other service provider out there.

2409
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:44,240
And then to just sort of put a little sprinkling

2410
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,040
on top of that tasty muffin.

2411
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,760
You know, because muffins with sprinkles are better.

2412
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,840
Ooh, they are.

2413
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:50,160
Just ask my five-year-old.

2414
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,880
They gave you a great API.

2415
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,160
Really straightforward.

2416
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,720
They've just recently updated it, well not,

2417
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:59,080
they updated it last year now, because this is 2016.

2418
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,780
That allows you to replicate the functionality

2419
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,160
of the control panel on a larger scale.

2420
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,180
And so there's a bunch of really nice open source code

2421
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:06,480
written around that API to manage droplets.

2422
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,320
It's nice.

2423
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,280
They got an HTML5 dashboard, so you can see it

2424
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,680
from boot all the way up to login.

2425
01:26:11,680 --> 01:26:12,500
It's a great system.

2426
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,520
Digitalocean.com.

2427
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,400
Use the promo code DOUNPLUG, get $10 credit.

2428
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,760
Also, go check out their documentation

2429
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,000
and their one-click deployment.

2430
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,880
You got Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, CoreOS, FreeBizzle.

2431
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:25,720
Is that what I see?

2432
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:27,160
FreeBSD right in the corner there?

2433
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,400
Yeah, yeah, that Alan Jude.

2434
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,120
That Alan, he's a campaigner.

2435
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:31,960
He's a campaigner.

2436
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,400
Let's see what we've got him,

2437
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,200
because it's running under KVM.

2438
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,840
Yeah, that's true.

2439
01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:37,680
That's true.

2440
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:42,200
Oh, that gives me a nice jolly.

2441
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:44,640
You can also deploy applications with a single click.

2442
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:46,120
They use DoCo in the background.

2443
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:47,240
They're big fans at Docker.

2444
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,920
They work upstream with the projects.

2445
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:49,760
It's pretty good.

2446
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,580
Digitalocean.com.

2447
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:52,000
Use the promo code DOUNPLUG.

2448
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,680
And a big thank you to Digitalocean

2449
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,280
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

2450
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:58,400
And thanks, you guys out there, for keeping the show going

2451
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:00,280
into 2016, and keep us going.

2452
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,000
Everyone get more droplets for 2016.

2453
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,680
DOUNPLUGED.

2454
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,000
All right, so in episode 3, Hyundai,

2455
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,840
and 45 of the Linux Action Show,

2456
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,680
I busted out my predictions.

2457
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,900
Now, traditionally, in the big show,

2458
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:16,160
what we do is we own up to our predictions from last year,

2459
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:17,400
and we make our new predictions.

2460
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:21,560
But since we had a host change up from Matt to Noah,

2461
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,160
I decided it wasn't really fair

2462
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:26,160
to make Noah own up to Matt's predictions, and vice versa.

2463
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,760
That would have been funny, though.

2464
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:29,700
What I did is I pulled out a few of my predictions,

2465
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,560
and I'm gonna own up to them in this episode.

2466
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:33,720
We start with a clean slate on last week,

2467
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:37,480
and then we'll do this own up thing in next year.

2468
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,080
I'm watching this, you know what?

2469
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,920
I came away realizing I didn't like

2470
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,960
the way I did this format last time.

2471
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,600
It really sucks to watch yourself,

2472
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:47,600
and then be like, you know what?

2473
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,560
I don't like the way I did that.

2474
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:52,520
So having watched this again, I decided

2475
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:55,520
I probably wouldn't do the format like this.

2476
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,720
So now I'm gonna, now I know, now I know.

2477
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:58,560
You know what I mean?

2478
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,560
Like, going forward, I'm gonna do this right.

2479
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,640
But what I will do here is I'm gonna play,

2480
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:07,040
I pulled out one, two, three, four predictions

2481
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,680
that I made, and I'm gonna see how I did.

2482
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,160
And I'll link to the full episode

2483
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,160
if you wanna watch all of them.

2484
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,160
But I wanna start with this one

2485
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,200
that I think I got half right.

2486
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,480
I kinda made the mistake of making

2487
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:20,320
like two predictions in one here,

2488
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,160
but I'm gonna play it for you.

2489
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:25,120
And this is about Debian, and how I thought

2490
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,200
that in 2015 they'd have a new feature come to Debian

2491
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,760
that would be a big hit.

2492
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:33,920
Hold on, that was my cue, but then I don't hear nothing.

2493
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,520
I hear nothing, hold on.

2494
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,440
See, Debian come up with a PPA-like solution for 2015.

2495
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:42,920
You know, like, honestly, one of the reasons

2496
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:47,160
I will go with Ubuntu over Debian is for PPAs.

2497
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:49,320
Yeah, yeah, but I would like them

2498
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,440
to not just, you know, carve and copy the concept.

2499
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,280
Because it's not a great system.

2500
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:54,120
It's not, I mean, even with PPA Manager,

2501
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,960
while that, god, that's a huge help,

2502
01:28:55,960 --> 01:28:58,960
it's more of a Pac-Man-like situation would be ideal.

2503
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,400
I would love, so obviously the Debian PPA thing,

2504
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,240
that didn't work out.

2505
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,080
That didn't happen.

2506
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,280
I thought for sure it would, too.

2507
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,480
And then there was even discussions in the mailing list

2508
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:08,960
about implementing a PPA-like system.

2509
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,080
Yeah, there was a lot of news about it.

2510
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,040
It got close, my prediction got real close.

2511
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:15,240
But it didn't quite work out.

2512
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:17,960
And then I kinda threw in like this other prediction.

2513
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:21,960
Love, love to see more distros work

2514
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,360
with the openSUSE build service in 2015.

2515
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,320
That would be cool.

2516
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,000
Although, open, yeah, it's a good idea,

2517
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
but their stuff is-

2518
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,320
It's not gonna happen, is it?

2519
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,720
There's still misses stuff.

2520
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,000
When I tried using it in the past,

2521
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,280
it does still miss some things.

2522
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,240
So, yeah, it's the right idea.

2523
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:37,240
I wanna put a stake in the ground right here.

2524
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,620
My prediction for openSUSE build service

2525
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:43,880
and for Copper is more of the same.

2526
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,120
And I think that was kind of true.

2527
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,800
I mean, they grew more, but it was just sort of more steady,

2528
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:48,960
more of the same.

2529
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,920
Nothing really broke through as like a big,

2530
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,080
like, oh, we're switching over to this.

2531
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,900
You think I kinda got that one, that last part right?

2532
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:57,000
I definitely didn't get the PPA thing right.

2533
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,280
Unfortunately, no.

2534
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:01,380
But the, yeah, I mean, I do think at least marginally more

2535
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:02,280
are using the build service.

2536
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,240
It's a great resource.

2537
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,540
I wish that more people would use it.

2538
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:07,600
I hope that's another repeat, let's just say.

2539
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,440
I hope that continues.

2540
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:11,200
All right, so then I made a prediction about Docker

2541
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:15,120
and how it might affect the Linux action show.

2542
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:18,040
I think containers will continue to see huge adoption.

2543
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,240
It's gonna blow up.

2544
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:20,360
Docker's gonna do great.

2545
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:21,720
Rocket's gonna do great.

2546
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:25,240
We're gonna come up with a lot of great new uses.

2547
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:27,800
You're gonna see probably your humble host

2548
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,160
here on the Linux action show say,

2549
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:31,220
here is a project, it's super cool,

2550
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:32,280
and you can do it in a container

2551
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:33,600
on your distribution right now.

2552
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,560
And we'll stop saying things like,

2553
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,000
this only works on Ubuntu.

2554
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,340
This only works on SUSE.

2555
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:39,840
This only works on Arch.

2556
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:44,320
That is gonna go away a little bit towards, but...

2557
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,160
So you know what?

2558
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,960
And it did kind of work out that way.

2559
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,120
Not completely as I thought,

2560
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:50,040
but I know off the top of my head,

2561
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:53,960
we talked about Smokeping and MB last year

2562
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:55,440
that at the end of the episode were like,

2563
01:30:55,440 --> 01:30:56,920
all right, go get this Docker container

2564
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:57,760
and you can use it.

2565
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:59,280
It came up a couple of times.

2566
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,720
But I saw you kind of go iffy.

2567
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,880
What was that iffy on, do you think?

2568
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:02,720
Oh, just don't know.

2569
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:04,440
I feel like Rocket from CoreOS.

2570
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:05,260
Oh yeah.

2571
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:06,100
It's not delivered as much as...

2572
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:06,940
Yeah, you're right.

2573
01:31:06,940 --> 01:31:07,760
It really hasn't, has it?

2574
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:09,160
Rocket hasn't been like huge.

2575
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,320
It's, yeah.

2576
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,160
They're there.

2577
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:11,980
I mean, I appreciate it.

2578
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:12,820
I like CoreOS, but...

2579
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:13,760
Yeah, yeah.

2580
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:15,480
Pocket Casey points out that ownCloud

2581
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:17,840
is using the openSUSE build service.

2582
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,480
In fact, I was gonna talk about that today in the episode.

2583
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,440
I just forgot.

2584
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:21,560
MB was for a while.

2585
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,300
Yeah, Joss Blog is like,

2586
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:28,000
don't use your native distro repo packages.

2587
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,800
You know, use the build service packages.

2588
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,100
So there's been some movement there,

2589
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,040
but I just attribute it at the same steady pace.

2590
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,920
I don't think the openSUSE build service

2591
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,040
or Copper has had a breakout.

2592
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,560
Like when I install Fedora,

2593
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:41,840
I still find Copper not nearly competitive at all

2594
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,320
with the AUR.

2595
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:46,400
And that's kind of my benchmark for both those things.

2596
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,360
All right.

2597
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,480
So I have one I'm saving towards the end,

2598
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:50,680
but I got one more.

2599
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:53,620
And I'm curious, I think this one is iffy.

2600
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:54,860
I wanna know what you think, Wes.

2601
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:56,560
I made a prediction about freeBSD

2602
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,520
kicking Linux in the bools.

2603
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:02,360
Is in large scale production, enterprise grade.

2604
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:05,740
People are gonna look at the Linux stack as a whole

2605
01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:07,980
and look at virtualization.

2606
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:09,920
They're gonna look at containerization

2607
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:13,080
and they're gonna look at the file system.

2608
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:18,080
And I predict that Linux over 2015

2609
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:24,480
will lose a lot of installations to freeBSD.

2610
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:27,960
I think 2015 will be the year

2611
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:32,960
that the Linux community recognizes the amount of heat

2612
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:35,400
that the freeBSD project

2613
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,380
and all of the people around freeBSD are bringing.

2614
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:41,680
So I was supposing that freeBSD

2615
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,820
would see a lot more market adoption.

2616
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:48,020
I don't know how to measure that now in looking back at it,

2617
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:50,920
but it does seem like a lot more VPS providers

2618
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,840
have started offering freeBSD.

2619
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,200
Free NAS has gotten a lot more mindshare

2620
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,940
and a lot more market.

2621
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:01,020
Noah just shared a story on Linux Action Show this Sunday

2622
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:02,160
about a client that wasn't even willing

2623
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,020
to consider Linux anymore.

2624
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:05,920
They wanted free NAS and CFS.

2625
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,240
So what do you think?

2626
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:08,400
Do you think?

2627
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,400
I think a lot of the system D stuff,

2628
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:13,280
I think there's a certain set of,

2629
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:15,060
well, on the Linux side,

2630
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:16,280
I think some of the system D fallout,

2631
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,900
there have been more Linux power users

2632
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:21,000
who have been exploring freeBSD.

2633
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,880
I think it still is the king

2634
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:27,320
in terms of easy, open source, secure data storage.

2635
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:28,280
But I'm not sure.

2636
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:30,640
I know from our emails that come into TechSnap,

2637
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:35,700
a lot of people have been switching in our audience.

2638
01:33:35,700 --> 01:33:37,640
So I know, and the BSD Now show

2639
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:39,720
has grown a ton in the last year.

2640
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:42,160
The BSD Now show really grew a lot last year.

2641
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:44,020
It was a big year for the BSD Now show.

2642
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:48,080
So yeah, I kind of think that did actually happen.

2643
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:49,080
If I go by those metrics.

2644
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:51,240
I think it does deserve to be recognized

2645
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:54,480
because freeBSD is a great open source project.

2646
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,800
I don't know, I feel like it deserves more recognition

2647
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,040
in the container space for jails.

2648
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,400
And I feel like there's the privileged admins

2649
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:02,720
and developers who do use it.

2650
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,900
But I feel like there's been so much further hype

2651
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:08,560
in the Linux community that that shift has not happened.

2652
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,840
Go ahead, Ryan.

2653
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,720
So I'm not really sure that even though there

2654
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:19,160
is a lot of interest in BSD, and especially

2655
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:22,200
among those who are really technical

2656
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:26,580
and like to explore this technology as far as they can

2657
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:28,720
and be kind of on the cutting edge,

2658
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:32,920
I think that we have to ask, at what expense?

2659
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:35,240
Is it at Linux's expense?

2660
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:38,840
No, I mean, Linux may be losing these users,

2661
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,680
but many are coming to take their place.

2662
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:42,880
That's a great way to put it.

2663
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,120
That's a great way to put it.

2664
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:46,080
There's so much momentum behind Linux and people

2665
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:47,980
that want to be creators and people that

2666
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:49,320
want to be on the cutting edge.

2667
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:51,380
There's so much momentum there that it's

2668
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:53,960
a drop in the bucket, right?

2669
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:55,680
Yeah, and I was just going to say,

2670
01:34:55,680 --> 01:35:00,120
I got the opportunity to talk to somebody who works for one

2671
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,880
of my former employers.

2672
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:06,000
And when I worked there, it was completely a Microsoft shop.

2673
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,960
They were a Microsoft Platinum partner,

2674
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,480
whatever the highest was, and they would not really

2675
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:11,680
deploy anything.

2676
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,440
I maintained three Linux servers that I

2677
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:16,600
had to beg to get in there.

2678
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:20,480
And I just had a conversation with one of the guys who

2679
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:24,440
works there, and now they have OpenStack deployed.

2680
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:29,640
It's pretty much all Linux where Windows was king before.

2681
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:32,120
And so I think about that, and I think,

2682
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:36,120
yeah, people might be moving over to BSD

2683
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,120
to try some of these technologies

2684
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:39,600
that they're interested in.

2685
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,320
But there are so many people continuing

2686
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,280
to come to Linux because it's becoming the de facto.

2687
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,680
The part that jumps out at me at the prediction

2688
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:50,960
is at the end there I said, by the end of 2015,

2689
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,520
we're going to recognize the heat that FreeBSD is bringing.

2690
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:57,400
And I think now if you look back at canonical preemptively

2691
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:00,200
announcing planned support for ZFS,

2692
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:03,100
I think that is sort of a recognition of the demand

2693
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:04,520
for some of the feature set there.

2694
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:07,560
Wimpy, you say more it's like you see FreeBSD going in

2695
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:10,120
for specific tasks, not really replacing Linux,

2696
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,360
but more like complementing it.

2697
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:13,080
Tell me more about that.

2698
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:16,200
Yeah, well, yes, replacing Linux, but not entirely.

2699
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:21,280
So the things that I do, I've been deploying

2700
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:24,640
PFSense for firewalls because if you're

2701
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:29,240
going for a full-on open source solution, in my opinion,

2702
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:31,360
there isn't a Linux-based firewall that

2703
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:34,320
can compete with PFSense.

2704
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:38,320
And in terms of doing big file servers,

2705
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:44,160
if you're not doing clustered storage like Ceph or GlusterFS,

2706
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:48,040
then ZFS is really the only game in town

2707
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:51,800
unless you really pay through the nose from something

2708
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:54,320
from EMC, for example.

2709
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:59,320
So I've been deploying BSD in those scenarios for file

2710
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:04,640
servers and for firewalls, but the rest of the Linux

2711
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:06,280
infrastructure has remained.

2712
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:10,400
So all of the big compute and data science stuff

2713
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,040
still runs on Linux.

2714
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:18,520
It's now just using TrueNAS in this case, or FreeNAS.

2715
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:19,200
As the back end.

2716
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:23,600
And ZFS as the back end, and then PF in front of it all.

2717
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:24,840
But I think you're right.

2718
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:30,200
I think with Ubuntu adopting ZFS in 16.04,

2719
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:34,200
and also some of the Debian derivatives,

2720
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:38,120
so Open Media Vault, for example, where ZFS is now

2721
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:42,120
an option, I think you were right in your predictions

2722
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:45,320
that this year is the year that Linux is going

2723
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:48,000
to sort of embrace ZFS, and ZFS will

2724
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:57,400
be the future of enterprise scale storage on Linux.

2725
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:00,120
And then you can layer all of the clustering file

2726
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:01,880
systems on top of that.

2727
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:04,200
So don't go away, because this last prediction,

2728
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,480
I think I kind of got it right.

2729
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:08,760
And I think what I got wrong was Ubuntu Mate edition

2730
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,720
wasn't at the forefront of my vocabulary at the time.

2731
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,040
But it's essentially, I think, what

2732
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,720
I was trying to say in my last prediction for 2015.

2733
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:17,360
Right.

2734
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,200
Here's what I think.

2735
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:24,920
I think 2015 will be the year that the bet that Mint took

2736
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:28,240
with their multi-year release, and that Ubuntu is taking

2737
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:31,720
with the let's not focus on a Unity 7,

2738
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:34,160
let's just make it better.

2739
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:37,600
I think 2015 is the year that that check is due.

2740
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,400
Like that payment needs to be made.

2741
01:38:39,400 --> 01:38:41,200
And 2015 is going to come along.

2742
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:44,240
And I'm not trying to brag, but guys

2743
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:47,120
like me on Arch, and Gnome 3, and the rolling releases,

2744
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:52,280
like KDE 5, SUSE Tumbleweed, Fedora,

2745
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:54,720
we are going to have such awesome desktops that's

2746
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:57,120
so much far and above what the commercial competitors are

2747
01:38:57,120 --> 01:39:02,360
going to do, that I suspect that where Linux's genuine gains are

2748
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,640
is in that geek, that enthusiast.

2749
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:08,680
That when we did how-to Linux in 2014,

2750
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:12,200
and Chase was sort of like the ideal Windows switcher.

2751
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:14,080
He was a Windows power user.

2752
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:15,560
He liked to tweak Windows.

2753
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,880
He was ready to do more.

2754
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,560
And what he found was, those old desktops

2755
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:22,400
were not very appealing to him.

2756
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,360
They weren't customizable enough.

2757
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,880
They weren't new enough.

2758
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:29,000
And I think in reality, you have more people switching

2759
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,840
to Linux that are savvy than you do that new mythical user.

2760
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:35,760
Over 2015, I think it's still going to be more of us,

2761
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,240
more geeks, more enthusiasts switching to Linux.

2762
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:42,520
And because of that, I think things like Plasma 5 and Gnome

2763
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:45,400
3 will be way better received, because you're

2764
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:48,240
getting a modern experience, you can still customize it.

2765
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:50,160
You don't feel like you're taking a step back.

2766
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:55,920
But I think in terms of raw numbers and organic adoption,

2767
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,920
things like the Matei project or Trinity,

2768
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:03,000
other classic desktop paradigms, I

2769
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,580
think that's where the most growth will happen.

2770
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:09,320
I think a lot of it's still going to be Ubuntu-based.

2771
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:11,440
Last year, I thought it was going to be Arch-based.

2772
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,200
I think this year it's going to be Ubuntu-based.

2773
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:13,820
Maybe I'll be wrong.

2774
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:14,960
Maybe it's going to be Fedora-based.

2775
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,380
I think a lot of it's going to be traditional Matei edition

2776
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:19,360
style, Ubuntu-based growth.

2777
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,720
But I think for power users, enthusiasts,

2778
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:24,760
the people that are watching this show, those of us who

2779
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:28,440
work in IT, those of us who are just like Windows power users

2780
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,020
that are switching to something else.

2781
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:30,640
I would agree.

2782
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:33,000
We're going to look for the more modern stuff.

2783
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,660
And a lot of the power user growth is going to happen there.

2784
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:36,740
So I think I got it right.

2785
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:38,800
The base usage growth, the granite growth,

2786
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:41,240
was in the Ubuntu Matei.

2787
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:43,360
And then people had to go with the Raspberry Pi grabbing

2788
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,120
the Ubuntu Matei edition.

2789
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:47,120
And then the people with powerful computers,

2790
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:50,400
more of us adopted Plasma 5 and Gnome 3 this year.

2791
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,920
That's sort of the long version of,

2792
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:53,360
that's a short version of a long thing I just said.

2793
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,720
But I think, I don't know, Wimpy,

2794
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:57,360
your thoughts being Mr. Ubuntu Matei over there?

2795
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,840
What do you think?

2796
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,960
I don't know.

2797
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:01,460
I know.

2798
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:04,180
It was a long way to get to it, watching that back.

2799
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:07,340
But I think essentially, it seems like Ubuntu Matei really,

2800
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:09,520
really came into its own in 2015.

2801
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:10,800
It really became recognized.

2802
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,440
It existed in 2014.

2803
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:16,240
But 2015, I mean, it became a serious contender.

2804
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,000
April, when the official version came,

2805
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,480
the official, when it became part of the Ubuntu family,

2806
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:26,960
that really did jump on quite considerably.

2807
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,300
Things have calmed down a bit now.

2808
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:30,000
People are used to the fact that it's there

2809
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,340
and it's part of the furniture.

2810
01:41:32,340 --> 01:41:34,160
So it's a bit more calm.

2811
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:36,280
I don't really know how to gauge,

2812
01:41:36,280 --> 01:41:38,280
because I've got no insight to how popular

2813
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:39,960
the other distributions are.

2814
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:41,880
I'm just pleased that I've made something

2815
01:41:41,880 --> 01:41:42,760
that's so many people.

2816
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,320
And there are a lot of people that are downloading it.

2817
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,960
Yeah, but you can just tell, as somebody

2818
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:47,620
who's been in the Linux community for a while,

2819
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:49,780
when a distribution moves up to the forefront

2820
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:53,880
and sort of gains mindshare.

2821
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:56,440
And yours has very quickly.

2822
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:57,920
Yeah.

2823
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:00,280
Yeah, maybe.

2824
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,400
I think, yes, it's clearly popular.

2825
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:06,280
I can't gauge how popular exactly versus the others.

2826
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,040
That's very difficult to do.

2827
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,600
But generally, there's a lot of interest

2828
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:13,720
around it, and that's very pleasing for me.

2829
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,320
You know, it started off as a bit of fun,

2830
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:17,960
and it's become a bit more than that.

2831
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:21,400
But yeah, it's been a very enjoyable journey

2832
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:23,320
and I'll make it continue.

2833
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:26,240
Now, Ryan is a crazy SOB, and he thinks

2834
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:28,120
that those blokes over at Canonical

2835
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:30,740
are going to actually make an Ubuntu vanilla desktop that's

2836
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:31,780
going to get all the buzz.

2837
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:35,240
Ryan, share your wisdom with me.

2838
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:38,280
So as somebody who spent a considerable amount of time

2839
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:41,520
using the Ubuntu phone here in the last,

2840
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,080
I don't know, probably month and a half,

2841
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:47,880
and just played around with Unity 8 a bit,

2842
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:52,160
I got to say that if the desktop, Unity 8 desktop,

2843
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:55,160
doesn't make a big splash, then the apps

2844
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:58,440
that the community has created for that desktop that

2845
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,540
seem to fit in so well in that desktop

2846
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:05,680
and scale as your screen size does, that I think

2847
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:08,720
will swing the pendulum back the other way.

2848
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:12,240
Because if you think about it, the Unity 7

2849
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:15,880
was just really iterative, almost for the past like two

2850
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:16,920
years.

2851
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:22,040
You know, it's just been bug fixes and the occasional,

2852
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:23,920
I would consider, minor feature.

2853
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,840
And I'm sure somebody could debate me on that.

2854
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,960
But especially this year, it kind of,

2855
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:32,600
it just kind of polished and fixed bugs.

2856
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:36,600
And I was using Gnome 3 quite a lot

2857
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:41,400
until I played around with the Ubuntu phone

2858
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:43,920
and then Unity 8 some.

2859
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,560
And I realized that they've actually

2860
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:47,840
got something really interesting there.

2861
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:51,460
And if I were going to predict, I

2862
01:43:51,460 --> 01:43:55,460
would say that there's going to be some renewed interest when

2863
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:57,160
they really push that to the forefront.

2864
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:00,400
So is this an official Ryan prediction for 2016?

2865
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:01,900
Because we've been writing it down.

2866
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:05,880
I'm willing to put my stamp on that.

2867
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,600
I've got another one if I can share it.

2868
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:09,920
Yeah, go ahead.

2869
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:11,360
So I've been saying this forever.

2870
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:14,320
And I know I'm sure Canonical doesn't like this

2871
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:17,160
when I spread these rumors.

2872
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:21,480
But I really think that we will see

2873
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:24,000
some Canonical partnerships.

2874
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,100
And I don't have any privileged information or anything.

2875
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:29,320
But I just think that I was looking

2876
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:33,240
at the stats of their cloud, how many deployments Ubuntu

2877
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:35,040
has in the cloud.

2878
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:38,440
And I don't feel like somebody who has so many,

2879
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:40,760
even on their competitors, like, well, not really,

2880
01:44:40,760 --> 01:44:42,080
they would say not a competitor.

2881
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:47,960
But Azure, on the Microsoft platform,

2882
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:50,720
they have significant market share.

2883
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:52,080
I don't think that's a play.

2884
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:53,760
I think what you want about Canonical,

2885
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:57,080
but that's not something they can ignore,

2886
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:00,000
these companies like Amazon and Microsoft.

2887
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,480
And so I would be really interested to see

2888
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:06,720
what happens with that company, Canonical,

2889
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:10,720
and their partnerships with these traditional big players

2890
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:11,720
in that space.

2891
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,280
So this Sunday on the Linux Action Show,

2892
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:15,800
we're doing what we wish happens in 2016.

2893
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:19,640
And one of my wishes, and I'll just give one of them away,

2894
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:23,720
I guess, is my wish is that Ubuntu's adoption

2895
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:27,080
in these cloud platforms encourages a desktop adoption

2896
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:30,400
after Unity 8 stabilizes, like Unity 8.5, Unity 8.7,

2897
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,600
something like that, is I really hope that.

2898
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,960
Can I?

2899
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:35,600
Go ahead.

2900
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:36,520
Sorry, go ahead.

2901
01:45:36,520 --> 01:45:42,000
No, I was just going to say, the thing that I think about

2902
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:48,280
is this year, it wasn't just Ubuntu, but people who,

2903
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:50,840
and we talk about the year of the Linux desktop every year.

2904
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,400
And I'm not saying it's the year of the Linux desktop,

2905
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:56,240
but the barriers to get there, every year,

2906
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:58,920
I think it's impossible for it to drop down again.

2907
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:01,760
I think this Linux, the desktop is

2908
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:04,200
going to remain this niche thing.

2909
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:07,120
And we've kind of got the users we're going to have.

2910
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:10,280
And it's just going to be the tinkerers, the hackers,

2911
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:16,000
and the really explorative, curious power users.

2912
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,240
But then something like Steam drops, or even more

2913
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:24,800
applications go to the web, or somebody implements,

2914
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:30,440
for instance, I've got Spotify on my Linux rig.

2915
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:33,320
And each time one of these things happen,

2916
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:35,880
somebody else can be talking to me.

2917
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:38,120
A new category of user can move over, yeah.

2918
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:39,920
Exactly.

2919
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:45,640
Months ago, I put my lay friend on the Ubuntu Mate desktop.

2920
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:49,840
And really, Spotify was probably the final app

2921
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:50,640
that made it doable.

2922
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:52,480
Not a single functionality or feature

2923
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,800
is missing anymore for her.

2924
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,080
Not a single thing.

2925
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,760
There's nothing that she needs her computer for

2926
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,840
that the Ubuntu Mate desktop is not providing.

2927
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:03,080
And maybe a stable Unity 8 could provide something

2928
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:05,560
of the reference platform that Ubuntu kind of already is,

2929
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,080
but in better form.

2930
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:07,880
I like it, Ryan.

2931
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,720
It's good stuff.

2932
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:16,520
I talked about this at System76, but I have a Yoga 2 laptop

2933
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,120
that I take around with me.

2934
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:21,000
And Unity 8 would be so cool if, when

2935
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,280
I flip it back to tablet mode right now,

2936
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:26,240
it just kills the keyboard and switches

2937
01:47:26,240 --> 01:47:29,400
to pulling up the online keyboard, which is fine.

2938
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:32,320
It allows me to just sit there and read a web page

2939
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,640
or something.

2940
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,600
But wouldn't it be so cool, since they

2941
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:40,200
have the tablet interface and the phone interface

2942
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:43,800
versus the desktop interface, if, when I did that,

2943
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:48,480
it actually switched to a complete touch-centric experience?

2944
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:51,120
Because when I want to read, I want

2945
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:54,720
to just be able to flip through the stuff with my hands,

2946
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:57,000
sitting there relaxed on the couch or whatever.

2947
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,640
And consolidating that device seems pretty nice,

2948
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,000
because I have all my files, and I

2949
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,560
wouldn't be using some kind of sync service to go to tablet.

2950
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,480
I agree.

2951
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:06,920
That's the dream.

2952
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:08,160
That's the dream, Ryan.

2953
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:11,440
And then you tie it all together with a little Mycroft here

2954
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:11,960
and there.

2955
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:15,120
And boy, that's a happy world after all.

2956
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:17,400
Yeah, then I don't even have to touch it anymore.

2957
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,920
I can just say things to it.

2958
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:20,320
Yeah, yeah, I love it.

2959
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,880
I love the fact that you're talking about the opposite way

2960
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,240
that whenever we talk about convergence at Canonica,

2961
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:28,800
we talk about how you take a phone out of your pocket,

2962
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:29,920
and you plug your keyboard and mouse,

2963
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:31,400
and it turns into a desktop.

2964
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:32,560
You want to go the other way.

2965
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,840
You want to take a desktop and turn it into a tablet.

2966
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:36,200
Oh, for me too, yeah.

2967
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:38,760
It should be able to do both of those.

2968
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:40,760
Yeah, I would say I fall in that category too.

2969
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:42,320
That's exactly how I think about it.

2970
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:45,080
Well, guys, I look forward to seeing both of you at Scale.

2971
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:46,840
Don't forget, if you're curious about Scale,

2972
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:48,120
we got links in the show notes.

2973
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:50,840
We also got links to all the Mycroft stuff that's

2974
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:52,720
going on, including the Indiegogo campaign

2975
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:53,880
and the community.

2976
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,560
As well, we have links to that episode of the Linux Action

2977
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:58,680
Show if you want to see all of the predictions of Matt

2978
01:48:58,680 --> 01:48:59,440
and mine.

2979
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,680
It's a whole bunch of stuff in the show notes this week.

2980
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:03,040
A whole bunch of stuff.

2981
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:03,760
Don't miss it.

2982
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:04,520
That's right.

2983
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:07,140
And you know, you could be here live to take in all of it

2984
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:08,440
and actually get even more show.

2985
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:09,240
You get some of it.

2986
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:10,200
Way more show.

2987
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:11,000
You get some of it.

2988
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,520
We could include some of it, but not all of it,

2989
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:14,880
especially the really dirty parts.

2990
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,380
What?

2991
01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:16,840
Whoa.

2992
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:18,280
Let's just say pants were involved.

2993
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:18,760
Yes.

2994
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:19,120
All right.

2995
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:21,160
So that brings us to the end of this week's episode

2996
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:22,080
of Linux Unplugged.

2997
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:24,400
We do this live on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv.

2998
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:26,640
Go to jubilabroadcasting.com slash calendar

2999
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:28,160
to get that in your local time zone.

3000
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:31,000
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com for topics and feedback

3001
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,520
into this here show.

3002
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,120
I'd love to get your feedback there.

3003
01:49:34,120 --> 01:49:35,800
And of course, join us live next week

3004
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:37,280
so you can be in the Mumble Room and take

3005
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,200
part of our virtual lug.

3006
01:49:38,200 --> 01:49:39,440
Thanks so much for tuning in.

3007
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,480
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

3008
01:49:41,480 --> 01:50:09,520
Good day.

3009
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:19,760
Now we're all done.

3010
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:21,960
I think it's time for a little Mycroft and Chili.

3011
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:24,000
We can just do this.

3012
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:24,760
That's a good show.

3013
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:26,440
Thank you, everybody, for making it out.

3014
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:28,760
That was an awesome show, guys.

3015
01:50:28,760 --> 01:50:30,720
Did you see my BSD and Chill image?

3016
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:32,920
Yeah, I did.

3017
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:34,160
That's perfect.

3018
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:35,680
Yeah, that's great.

3019
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:36,680
BSD and Chill.

3020
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:38,800
I guess it's like now that I did

3021
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:40,640
the whole, now that I totally didn't

3022
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,320
get the whole Netflix and Chill reference,

3023
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,440
now I'm seeing even Ted Cruz is making references

3024
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:45,400
to Netflix and Chill.

3025
01:50:45,400 --> 01:50:49,360
I am an old man when Ted Cruz has got a meme faster

3026
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,280
than I do.

3027
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:51,680
All right, jbtitles.com.

3028
01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:53,680
Let's go vote.

3029
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:57,360
Speaking of which, my wife is actually chilling here.

3030
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,320
I had the headphones unplugged for a little bit,

3031
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:01,000
and she was listening to you.

3032
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:01,520
What'd she think?

3033
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:02,320
She liked the show?

3034
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:06,640
And hold on.

3035
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,440
Java with Gnome Phone was kind of good.

3036
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:09,800
Oh, right, titles.

3037
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:11,400
Minecraft Action Show, that's not bad.

3038
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:18,320
Master Clickbaiting, that's good, too.

3039
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,360
Here she is.

3040
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:21,200
I'm going to let her tell you in her own words.

3041
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,440
Hello, Ryan's wife.

3042
01:51:22,440 --> 01:51:24,360
Hello.

3043
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:25,320
Ryan, hello.

3044
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:26,200
What's your name?

3045
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:26,920
Hello.

3046
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:27,440
Hi.

3047
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:28,160
Misha.

3048
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:28,640
Hi.

3049
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:32,520
So what'd you think of the show today?

3050
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:34,400
I actually didn't hear the show today.

3051
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,240
I was working.

3052
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:40,000
But I actually hear your various shows quite often

3053
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,200
because Ryan listens while he's in the shower

3054
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,440
and has it over a big speaker.

3055
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:46,200
How considerate.

3056
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:46,920
That's nice.

3057
01:51:46,920 --> 01:51:47,560
That's good.

3058
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:48,600
Yes.

3059
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:49,120
Yes.

3060
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:51,800
So I stay quite informed on Linux news.

3061
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:52,400
Oh, good.

3062
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,360
I listen in my fortress of solitude.

3063
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:54,840
Right.

3064
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:57,920
So while you're having shower thoughts, I understand.

3065
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:58,560
That's pretty good.

3066
01:51:58,560 --> 01:51:59,800
Yeah, it's the best time.

3067
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:01,040
All right, so give me your feedback.

3068
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:03,080
This is your chance to give me any feedback, any improvements

3069
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:03,680
you'd like me to make.

3070
01:52:03,680 --> 01:52:04,000
Go ahead.

3071
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:04,840
I'll note them down right here.

3072
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:05,760
I got a piece of paper.

3073
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:06,160
I'll note them down right here.

3074
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:07,080
I got a piece of paper.

3075
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:07,600
Oh, OK.

3076
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:09,120
OK.

3077
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:14,120
Maybe more, I don't know.

3078
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:15,200
I don't know.

3079
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:15,840
Really?

3080
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:16,640
I guess that's good.

3081
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,920
Something complementary.

3082
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,120
Yeah, something involving magic would be great.

3083
01:52:20,120 --> 01:52:20,680
More magic.

3084
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:22,040
OK, I'll write magic.

3085
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:22,520
Yeah.

3086
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:23,840
All right, magic and sparkles.

3087
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:24,480
Yeah, OK, I got this.

3088
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:25,480
Purple elephants.

3089
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:26,160
Purple.

3090
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:27,720
OK, these are all things I can work on.

3091
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:29,440
Purple elephants.

3092
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,040
Good.

3093
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:30,680
OK, thank you.

3094
01:52:30,680 --> 01:52:31,080
Yeah.

3095
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:32,160
That's solid feedback.

3096
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:36,080
The thing that I wonder about, Chris,

3097
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:39,920
because she gets to listen to you on Linux Action Show,

3098
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:43,160
Linux Unplugged, and Coder Radio mostly.

3099
01:52:43,160 --> 01:52:50,520
My question is, I know you have the women's,

3100
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:54,440
I'm blanking on the name, but I have the Women's Tech Radio.

3101
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:58,120
And I'm curious, do you know how much of your audience

3102
01:52:58,120 --> 01:53:01,960
as maybe a percentage or as a number is women?

3103
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:03,400
Do you have any idea on that?

3104
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,320
I don't think I have any current numbers,

3105
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:08,920
but I don't think it's a huge, I don't think it's more than about 6%

3106
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,720
or 7%, but I'm not sure.

3107
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:12,640
And how many of them are forced to listen

3108
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:13,880
by their showering husbands?

3109
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:14,880
Yeah.

3110
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,120
I'm going to have to try that.

3111
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:16,640
Do those count?

3112
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:17,120
Do those count?

3113
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:20,200
Maybe that could be a new marketing approach.

3114
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:23,200
Spread the word via the shower.

3115
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:29,280
Get those, tell those sponsors, if you're trying

3116
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:33,800
to hit this demographic, women who are forced to listen

3117
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:39,240
to their husband's podcast, then you never know.

3118
01:53:39,240 --> 01:53:42,040
We could have Ting, and then we could have, I don't know,

3119
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,280
what's a brand that wouldn't offend every woman that

3120
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:46,000
listens to this, if I said it?

3121
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,320
I feel like I could focus on shower-related products, too.

3122
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,880
That could be a new category.

3123
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:52,280
I could focus on soap.

3124
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:53,840
Yeah, oh, yeah.

3125
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:57,000
It's a video show, just chest up, Chris showering,

3126
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:58,400
shampooing his hair.

3127
01:53:58,400 --> 01:53:59,400
No more.

3128
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,400
No more shower talk.

3129
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:03,480
Actually, I would like to know what hair products he uses.

3130
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:04,480
He says he doesn't.

3131
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:05,480
Cut you guys off.

3132
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:06,480
This is ridiculous.

3133
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:07,480
This is Washington water.

3134
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:08,720
End of discussion right there.

3135
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:10,000
End of discussion.

3136
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:13,400
Just had my first day at my new job today, and I'm super excited.

3137
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:14,400
Oh, congratulations.

3138
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:15,400
How did it go?

3139
01:54:15,400 --> 01:54:16,400
Yeah, great.

3140
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:17,400
Like-minded people.

3141
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,400
Fabulous.

3142
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,400
All the right things.

3143
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:21,400
Lots of Debian, lots of Ubuntu, lots of open source.

3144
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:22,400
Yeah, really?

3145
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:23,400
That sounds wonderful.

3146
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:26,400
So are you saying Ubuntu and Debian on the desktop?

3147
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:27,400
What are you saying?

3148
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:31,400
I'm saying Debian for server infrastructure and Ubuntu on the desktop.

3149
01:54:31,400 --> 01:54:32,400
Nice.

3150
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:33,400
Mm-hmm.

3151
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:34,400
Mm-hmm.

3152
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:35,400
Get in.

3153
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:36,400
Get in?

3154
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:37,400
What the heck?

3155
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:38,400
That's such an old man thing to say.

3156
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:39,400
No, it's not.

3157
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:40,400
It's a very British thing to say.

3158
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:41,400
Oh, okay.

3159
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:42,400
Oh, okay.

3160
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:43,400
It sounds old.

3161
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:44,400
It sounds old.

3162
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:45,400
Yeah.

3163
01:54:45,400 --> 01:55:04,400
It sounds old.
