1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Wes Payne, ladies and gentlemen, bringing in something that smells rather fierce here, Wes.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What do we have here?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's in a red solo cup, too, so I have legitimately no idea what it is.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's like a sneaky beer.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's a very interesting taste.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah, what is it? What is it?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What do you think it is?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, it's fruity on the nose.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm going to go a little beer is tasty on you here just for a moment, okay?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, it's definitely fruity on the nose.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's got a thin, crisp smell.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It has a very thin head, just a thick layer of foam on top, but not a lot of head there.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm going to go ahead and go for the mouth test.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The good thing is I don't completely hate it, so that's a good sign.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Wow. Well, it's interesting. It's sort of got a lot going on on the higher notes with kind of a sparkle effect, like a real carbonation, but there's not much in the middle.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There's not a lot in the middle.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I kind of like that.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, it's definitely very drinkable. You could drink it very fast. It's good. It's refreshing, too.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If it was hot, like right now if we didn't have the AC going, like once we turn off the AC and it starts getting warm in here, I'm going to get warm and this is going to refresh the crap out of me.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's got a little bit of the bitterness, but it doesn't sit on your tongue.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, but I feel like it's not hops that I'm getting, but I mean it might be.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know. Citrusy isn't the right word because it's not citrusy.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, kind of. It reminds me of grapefruit somewhat.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah. Okay, so tell us what's going on here.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's real simple. It's just a Sierra Nevada hefeweizen.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Huh.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh, that's where the citrus is coming from.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There you go.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That is hilarious.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
None of the six packs looked good, so I just grabbed a 22 and split it between us. That's what happened here.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So you combined—hold on, just so I understand what you just did here—you combined soda pop and beer?

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Right together.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Where the hell did you get that idea?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What the hell?

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you not have Shandy in the U.S.?

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, no. I guess. I guess. I just—wow, Wes. That's good, though. That's ingenious.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You know what? I applaud your resourcefulness.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, thank you, sir.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 212 for August 29, 2017.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux podcast that might be dodging airplanes as we record.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
My name is Chris.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's your go. That's your cue.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, sorry. What am I doing?

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Are you installing Gentoo over there or something?

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Maybe, yeah, a little bit. I was hanging the command line challenge.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And, of course, we're joined by Beardsley. Hello, Beardsley.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hello.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hello. You know, guys, it's okay if you want to install Gentoo, but wake up. We have a lot to talk about today.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We sure do.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
In fact, we'll get to the Gentoo challenge here in just a moment, but first we're going to do big community updates, really big community updates,

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and maybe a couple that might make you a little hungry, plus a new segment that might have to become a reoccurring segment, we'll see, called Wimpy Was Right.

52
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We'll talk about that. It pains me. It pains me.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah, I hope not.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Bitcoin was spent. It pains me.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And then we're going to do a little follow-up on your feedback about replacing LastPass, a lot of great suggestions.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Plus, Mr. West there found a great tool that might just do the job for you for your offsite backups.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Then, Purism is getting serious about creating a phone.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They call it the Librem 5, and as we record right now, their fundraiser is about 10% funded.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's actually a substantial amount of money.

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And also, as we record right now, coming into the studio is a brand new Librem 15 to replace the one that I crowdfunded years ago now.

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Right here, we're going to do a live unboxing and look at the new Librem 15 that was just sent to us by Purism right here on the show.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, we'll just do initial hands-on reactions, and then we'll do a review later on.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
So, we're going to take a look at that.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Plus, we're going to talk about their new fundraiser.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We're going to talk about all the things I mentioned and community updates.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But before we go any further, we've got to bring in that virtual lug.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes, we do.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Time appropriate. Greetings, Mumble Room.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hello.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Guys, I have to start the show with a plea to you.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm going to make you judge and jury here.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There may be a penance that I have to pay.

73
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't know what it would be, but we'll discuss that.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We have to punt the Gen 2 Challenge one more week in light of the new Librem 15 hardware.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's just what we've got to talk about today.

76
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It just came in.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't know, Chris.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It sounds to me like you're scared.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It sounds like you're still compiling.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, did you install KDE?

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now it makes sense.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I was going to ask for your guidance, Mumble Room, on what we should do in light of yet another punt of the Gen 2 Challenge.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Where do we go from here?

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Because to me, it feels like a fail to deliver.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But to be honest, we've had some really good reasons.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, I think so.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm torn up, and I need your guidance.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's just say we're workshopping it.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's a special distro.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It needs a special take.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, yeah.

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So here's what I was hoping is maybe if I, in exchange for something, some of you would help us with the Gen 2 Challenge to really keep us to it next week.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If one of you in there were willing to also take the Gen 2 Challenge with us, then we would feel obligated at a friend level to really make sure it gets done.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't know what that pen seems to be to make that happen, but I feel like that's what it would take right now.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Does anybody understand that in the mumble room?

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Anyone?

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I think the penance has to be Linux from scratch challenge after this.

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I mean, producer Michael, you're trying out Linux all the time, and there could be additional content in it.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Monkey Comm, you've got to be thinking about Gen 2 sometimes.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Somebody in there, Mr. Arm, you have to be a little curious.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Nobody wants to take the Gen 2 Challenge with us.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Ain't nobody got time for that.

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Interesting.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I did Gen 2 about four or five years ago, and that's all I need to know.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So screwed.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Maybe Wimpy needs to see what mate is like on Gen 2.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No, he really doesn't.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Wow. What does that tell us?

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I tried it, and my boredom threshold got hit very, very quickly, and I was like, screw this, and just switched off the VM.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've always been of the opinion that the best place for Gen 2 is in embedded systems.

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I thought you were going to say the kitchen, just for a second.

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Sure.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The best place for Gen 2 is Chrome OS.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
There's plenty of embedded systems in your kitchen.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So the Chrome OS is a great thing to bring up, producer Michael, because it's a reminder that it's legitimately a relevant distro, isn't it?

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
For sure.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And the fact that it's based on Gen 2 makes Gen 2 even more important.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But I think most people aren't going to be putting much effort into Gen 2.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I did it once, just to say I did it, and that's enough I care about.

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I did it for years in production because it was the only way to get the versions of CUPS and the drivers I needed to get the bank that I wanted to move over to Linux to move.

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's one of its advantages, right? You have that kind of control.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The unfortunate thing is that Gen 2 is no longer the fastest, and just because it's sourced, people assume that it's going to be the fastest updated. It's not. It's very, very slow in some cases.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I've had software that just was abandoned years ago, and they don't even care.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And people who are trying to get maintainership are not given maintainership.

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I just want a hypothetical situation.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
We'll step into the transporter.

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We'll go into the mirror universe where Gen 2 no longer exists.

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Maybe Chrome OS is based off of Linux from scratch or Android or whatever.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What changes?

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I mean, they used to be known for really great documentation, but now that's sort of Arch's mantle.

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Right. Yeah, it is.

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So what changed?

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
They still have that documentation.

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I think Gen 2's documentation is better than Arch.

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I think there's a lot of things on Gen 2 that Arch doesn't address and Gen 2 does.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Hmm. Well, okay.

137
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So, gosh, I feel like you and I are...

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Although I did fix one of the things on the Arch Wiki that I found on the Gen 2 Wiki, but whatever.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Well, I, in some ways, now am more determined than ever to prove all of you jerks wrong

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and show you that there's some value still in my old friend Gen 2.

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You know what you should do, Chris?

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What?

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You should install Gen 2 on that super ancient laptop you did on that last throwback.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You know where Gen 2 makes a lot of sense to me?

145
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's like a Raspberry Pi 3 where I do the building off the machine.

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Like either using...

147
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, back in the day...

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The CC?

149
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah. Is that still a thing?

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeah.

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It is?

152
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I used the shit out of that back in the day because I had a whole server farm.

154
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And so I would just distribute the builds like crazy and I was like, update, shmupdate.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yeah, I used to run Gen 2 on a Wii way back when, and it worked very nicely.

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Had mPlayer going, could stream things to it, it was great.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, let's get into community updates.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Maybe we'll have more from Gen 2 land in the near future.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But this week we're going to talk about the new Librem 15 that came into the studio.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But first, there's a story that has been going steady since January,

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and it's picking up more and more momentum, and I'm kind of wondering what we all make of it.

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Mazda and Toyota now are getting together on this Linux infotainment system for cars.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's a project that the Linux Foundation has been working on,

165
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and they've been, to some success, keeping it in the news every single week,

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
and that seems to be paying dividends now.

167
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
With Mazda and Toyota joining forces, they're going to be working together

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
on the Linux-based connected car navigation entertainment system.

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Now, the system that Toyota ships and has been shipping I think since 2012 is called Intune.

170
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's an in-car infotainment platform, and it's got all the crap that is always sort of hacky and not so great.

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's got the hands-free phone call support over Bluetooth, music streaming, satnav, as they call it,

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and it's running on top of Linux.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This automotive-grade Linux project is taking off more and more, though,

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
with different people getting into Toyota and now Mazda and others that are getting involved.

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The reason why they're working together, even though they're competitors,

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
at least according to a Japanese business newspaper that the Register is citing,

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
they reckon that the joint effort is at least partially due to a shortage of vehicle-focused software development

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
and developers, especially in the land of the rising sun, as the Register puts it.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So, Intune and, in broader scope, the automotive-grade Linux project,

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I've talked about it a couple of times now on Linux Action News,

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and I've done some research into the project, and it seems interesting.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
If you are someone who likes to have everything built into your headset,

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
where it does all the nav, it does your music, it runs your apps, it does your streaming, it has Pandora,

184
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
maybe it has some kind of iHeartRadio and Spotify.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Right now, currently, because Microsoft's involved, it includes Bing.

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah!

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah, and you can get OpenTable for booking restaurant tables and whatnot.

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Those things are all inside the Dash and running on this Linux system.

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's the approach of automotive-grade Linux versus, say, Android AutoPlay or Apple CarPlay,

190
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
which is more built around the smarts being in the phone and then the receiver,

191
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
the headset being more of like a projection, it's a client of the smarts in the phone.

192
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The automotive-grade Linux project does not support CarPlay or Android AutoPlay or whatever,

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Android Auto as it's called, so it's sort of a competitor to those.

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And so, therefore, I'm a little leery on it as somebody who owns a 2012 vehicle

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
and is ready to replace that really old, prehistoric, awful computer in the dash.

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, man, no kidding, right?

197
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I really don't want to replace it with another one that I'm just going to get driven crazy by later on.

198
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I am more and more thinking about maybe a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen,

199
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
maybe even something as crazy as an NVIDIA Shield, or maybe Android Auto or CarPlay.

200
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
All these things, it's not that I'm going to be doing any time soon,

201
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
but right now what I can't deny is I have an audio aux-in.

202
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
A lot of people use Bluetooth, but I've been using audio aux-in,

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and I just play everything from my phone.

204
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If I want news, I listen on my phone.

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If I want music, and, of course, podcasts, I do it all on my phone,

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and the receiver in my truck is just like a dummy unit.

207
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It could just be a glorified – it could just be a volume knob and an aux-in jack for all I care these days.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So I don't need a lot in dash, and automotive-grade Linux is more about you build your entire system

209
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
on top of this Linux platform where we give you these basic functions and apps and UI elements,

210
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and then you deliver an experience for your car on top of it,

211
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
which is what automakers are interested in.

212
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But as an end user, I'm good just with my aux-in jack and running it off my phone.

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Well, in theory, you could also take the base that you get a car that has support for that.

214
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Maybe, maybe if they don't have some weird locking system or whatever,

215
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
you could replace it with whatever system you want.

216
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Sure.

217
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Well, that would be nice.

218
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There's also – this is interesting mainly because Mazda and Toyota already have a partnership for other things,

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
and it kind of solidifies it even more that they're partnering.

220
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Good point.

221
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Because they have partnerships with a technology of car development technology,

222
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
so now that they're doing it with the infotainment part of it, it means that it's likely that –

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I mean, this particular one, if this was the first time, it would be kind of weird,

224
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
but the fact that they've been doing it for a few years now,

225
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
it means that this is likely to be a pretty solid partnership.

226
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Sure. That makes sense.

227
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I agree with you. I'm just going to do this on my phone. I have my phone set up.

228
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But for people who just use a phone as a phone, if those people still exist,

229
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
is there value in having a better platform in the car?

230
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Maybe you're a senior and you want to be able to – you know about some of these things,

231
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
but you don't want to have to try to figure out how to do that and use the small screen of your car.

232
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah, I think so.

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Especially if they can make it better quality connection with your phone calls.

234
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I know a lot of people who are at that age that use the Bluetooth in-car stuff that are just –

235
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
it's just an awful experience. It's hard to set up. It's like the worst quality audio possible.

236
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If they can fix that, that would be fantastic.

237
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What about self-driving where there's so much information that all has to be integrated –

238
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
speed, traffic, weather conditions, information to the driver?

239
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It seems like having a platform that these car manufacturers – a common technology base

240
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
that is sound and proven based on Linux that they can build on top of, they've got to be working this.

241
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Even if as a consumer, like the reasons I just vocalized, I'd prefer to just do it all from my phone.

242
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Three generations from now of drivers, though, they're going to have a totally different set of requirements,

243
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and they're going to need a really refined system to bring all that information together.

244
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So I kind of get why they're working on it.

245
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Is it funny that we haven't even talked about that we're –

246
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
like we're talking about it because it's Linux probably, but we haven't talked at all about it being good for Linux or not?

247
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Or is that just – I think that we're just – we assume that this is what Linux does now, right?

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's in embedded systems. It's in cars.

249
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Hmm. Yeah, I guess so, huh?

250
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah. I guess maybe because I get a little lost in the – my thoughts are like, what version of Linux is it?

251
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's a good question.

252
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What kernel is it running?

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
There's not a lot of details here even about the product.

254
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No, if there was, I'd be talking about it.

255
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, you're right. So I haven't really thought about, like, what does it mean for Linux?

256
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I guess I don't think about that much anymore.

257
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I've mentioned this recently, but we used to be supremely concerned with the Tivoization of Linux.

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That was a supreme concern for us.

259
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And really sort of the impetus of the GPL3.

260
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah, right. Exactly.

261
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, that was the Tivo issue of, like, trying to lock down Linux or violating it.

262
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And here we are, and there's a foundation that's – all right, so moving on.

263
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is something that I think Popey's really going to have to get in on.

264
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I know he likes cryptocurrencies quite a bit.

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Popey, we should really make you our cryptocurrency reporter, to be honest.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah, in the field.

267
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah, in the field, on the lines of the Brexit –

268
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
In the bits.

269
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
On the lines of Brexit, where cryptocurrency will become more relevant than ever, is our field reporter, Popey.

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
And submitted to the desk, Mr. Popey, was this story by BBC.

271
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And it is Burger King launching a Whopper coin in Russia.

272
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
And the reason why I wanted to put this in here is because, of course, this is going to happen.

273
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You open source blockchain technology, of course this is going to happen.

274
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
This is the natural progression when you open source a fundamental technology like this.

275
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So Russians will be able to buy a Whopper with virtual cash once they have amassed 1,700 Whopper coins.

276
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Whopper coin.

277
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's a lot, though.

278
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah, it is, yeah.

279
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And so WAVES is implementing this.

280
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
They're going to use a blockchain ledger to keep track of who's gotten coins,

281
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
although some people say they've been getting screwed already.

282
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So here you go, ladies and gentlemen.

283
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This is Burger King helping usher in a cyber dystopia.

284
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Thank you, Burger King.

285
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And of course it's Russia.

286
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's either Russia or Florida.

287
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
How is this any different than the half a dozen store loyalty cards that I already have in my wallet that I get no value out of?

288
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think it's actually better, to tell you the truth.

289
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You know, I mean, you tell me you're a crypto reporter, Poby,

290
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
but to me this actually seems a little more legit because honestly, especially if I could trade,

291
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
say, you know, you're a big Whopper guy, you want to go get a Whopper in Peru, I could throw you some of my Whopper coins.

292
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, not only that, but I'm sure there's going to be a Whopper coin to Bitcoin exchange rate.

293
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, my gosh.

294
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It seems to me you're going to have to eat an awful lot of Whoppers in order for this to be worth anything at all.

295
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Or you've just got to hang around outside and accost everyone who gets their Whopper coins and buy them

296
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,000
when they're clueless people who don't know anything about blockchain stuff, which obviously isn't me.

297
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, you can always be right.

298
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Of course, you're a reporter.

299
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But what about, I mean, in your opinion, what about getting into like Whopper coin day trading where you,

300
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
but depending on you peg it to like, say, the dollar and when the Whopper coin is strong and the dollar is weak,

301
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
you could trade Whopper coins to other people using their iOS and Android apps.

302
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I mean, that seems.

303
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Well, I was thinking just amassing a ton of Whopper coins and then you just hoard them and you wait for the Bitcoin price to crash,

304
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
transfer all the Bitcoins and suddenly you just made a bunch of Bitcoin.

305
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Okay.

306
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Which I'm still going to spend on hamburgers, but whatever.

307
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So I guess the only natural conclusion and wimpy, this is just a suggestion.

308
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm just going to I'm an idea guy.

309
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm going to throw it out here for you.

310
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You can choose to run with this, but I think you should seriously consider implementing a Matecoin.

311
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And then here's the here's the thing.

312
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You what you do is you patch Kaja and people could share their local storage into a pooled encrypted shared cloud storage

313
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
using BitTorrent to distribute files.

314
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And the more storage you share and bandwidth you share, the more Matecoin you earn.

315
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So, you know, you know that that exactly what you've described exists.

316
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah.

317
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah. I'm not that original.

318
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Am I?

319
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yeah.

320
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's very good, actually.

321
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yeah.

322
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yeah.

323
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's a storage storage share.

324
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah.

325
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
S T O R J.

326
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And there's a even a command line version, a terminal version, and there's a version.

327
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's too funny.

328
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But you don't get any burgers.

329
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There's no hamburgers involved with this.

330
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm sure there'll be an exchange, right?

331
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Which is the downside exchange it to Whopper coin.

332
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That'd be OK.

333
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, I think we need to discuss the most important question.

334
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The Whopper coin be used for chicken fries.

335
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

336
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Especially the Cheeto ones.

337
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Right.

338
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And you did those suckers.

339
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Or is it just Whoppers?

340
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Because I'd be disappointed.

341
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Right.

342
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Right.

343
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
OK.

344
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I got I have to I have to admit something.

345
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And this is this this technically qualifies.

346
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah.

347
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You know how that makes me feel.

348
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah.

349
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yeah.

350
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
And the value of this is negative.

351
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So Wimpy was right.

352
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Wimpy Wimpy was right.

353
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
This never happens.

354
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
VR is dead.

355
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm going to I'm going to extract this clip and get it to my wife tomorrow.

356
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'll say it right now.

357
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Nice and clean right up front.

358
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I hate to admit it, but Wimpy was right.

359
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
VR was hype.

360
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's officially dead according to TechCrunch.

361
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And I think they're right because the metric they're using is is kind of sound.

362
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's this year's E3.

363
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's the biggest gaming date in the gaming industry.

364
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's known under its full titles Electronic Entertainment Expo.

365
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Huh?

366
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Huh?

367
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Woo.

368
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Uh huh.

369
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,660
And there was an Oculus shaped rift where there should have been a lot of showing off

370
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:53,520
of new games and HTC is dropping their price as well as Oculus.

371
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,960
And TechCrunch's Lucas Matney says over the past several months it's become clear that

372
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,200
the war is no longer HTC and Oculus trying to discover who is Betamax and VHS.

373
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:11,080
Now they're trying to ensure that high end VR does not turn out to be laser discs.

374
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,080
My kind of point of view, Chris?

375
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
That hurts.

376
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
It does.

377
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,000
Star Trek bridge crew.

378
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Haven't tried it.

379
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,540
You know, I'm thinking about I'm thinking about why I have a Windows 10 machine trying

380
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,360
it because I have one for like I think I feel like this week I'm going to have a Windows

381
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,480
10 machine and that's about as long as I'm going to make it.

382
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:32,040
I should give it a go because VR can't possibly be dead if you can play Star Trek on it.

383
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
I know.

384
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,200
I mean, I have seen it at like some bars and other type venues that have these sorts of

385
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,680
like and there's at least one in Seattle that has like you can go there and play VR including

386
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Star Trek.

387
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,960
So I think you can have like a party where you rent multiple of their rooms and then

388
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,600
you're all playing Star Trek together.

389
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
No kidding.

390
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Yeah.

391
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
So that sounds fun.

392
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,200
But it doesn't make it necessarily the same sort of cost benefit for an individual consumer.

393
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,160
I also think that they're they're not counting the fact that PlayStation just added VR to

394
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,640
their system.

395
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,360
Like that's a relatively large user base that they're going to be targeting.

396
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,920
Well, they added that in December last year, didn't they?

397
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,120
And the sales were well, well lower than they were anticipating.

398
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Well, yeah.

399
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,640
But I didn't I didn't know that this was the topic that was going to come up.

400
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:24,240
But what's interesting is I happened to be thinking about the whole VR thing because,

401
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,960
you know, predictions for this year, you know, December's coming and I was reflecting on

402
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,840
my predictions this year, which have the usual VR is rubbish in it.

403
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,720
And I went back and I listened to what episode number is this of Linux Unplugged?

404
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
212.

405
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:48,720
OK, so I listened back to episode 82 of Linux Unplugged, where Poppy and I have a rather

406
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,920
heated exchange about the relevancy of VR and everything that was discussed back in

407
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,240
episode 82 is the same today.

408
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,000
I had a good experience and I just wanted other people to I just wanted I feel like

409
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,160
the problem was it was the hardware and it was the expense.

410
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,320
Were you going to say something, Poppy?

411
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,920
I was just trying to remember that that conversation, I tried to block out of my mind because Martin

412
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
was right.

413
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
And you're focused on cryptocurrencies.

414
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
Oh, my goodness.

415
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
I'm so having that as my ringtone.

416
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,280
I do hope everyone else was talking over me.

417
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,280
So Martin can't grab.

418
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,280
Yeah, no.

419
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,280
Martin was right.

420
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,280
Right.

421
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
Talk over, talk over.

422
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,280
So did we talk about only VR or did we talk about AR as well?

423
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,720
I think back then we were only talking about VR.

424
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,720
I think we touched on AR at the very end.

425
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,840
But I think I suggested that that might be the only thing that would be useful.

426
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,200
You might be right on that because Google have announced AR Core for Android.

427
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,760
Yeah, that's the thing today.

428
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,240
So AR Core, which is like AR Kit, can even kind of sounds a bit alike.

429
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,800
And the reason why these are pretty substantial is you can write once and run on both because

430
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,440
you're talking about Unity and Unreal 4 here and then the tools in between will make it

431
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,720
run on AR Kit or, in theory now, AR Core.

432
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,040
And I've been seeing, if you step outside the Linux bubble, I got to say there have

433
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,640
been some significantly impressive AR demos.

434
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,400
I'm sure we've all seen them on Twitter and stuff of the iPhone with iOS 11.

435
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,920
There is some really interesting stuff happening there.

436
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,960
And it does make sense to do it at the phone level because you've got all those sensors

437
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,320
for where you're at in space, the angle of the device, the cameras.

438
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,360
Which has already had a ton of development effort poured into them over the years.

439
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:48,120
And then a really solid way to deliver new versions of the apps which need cutting edge

440
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,900
development to stay competitive.

441
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,460
It just makes sense to do it there.

442
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,680
But I mourn for the loss of high-end VR on the PC because it's so much better than anything

443
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,320
you could do with cardboard or even AR.

444
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,800
Yeah, see, I don't think VR is dead.

445
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,400
I think just the VR hype is dying.

446
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,640
I think VR is continuing to progress and starting to come more in line with consumer expectations

447
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,120
in terms of price.

448
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,240
That's why the price drops are coming, not because-

449
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,480
I don't think that this is an issue about price.

450
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,760
I think the issue is you have to wear equipment which tethers you to a computer.

451
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,120
And the solution to that apparently is to buy a backpack that you put your computer

452
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,920
in so you can now walk around tethered to this computer that you carry.

453
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:36,880
And then all of these sensors that you have to rig up in a room to know where you are.

454
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
Ultimately you're blindfolded.

455
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,900
You can't actually see what you're doing.

456
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,440
So you're just an accident waiting to happen.

457
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,820
And then there's the expense on top.

458
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:51,400
So there's a lot of reasons why VR has just got a load of reasons why mass consumer adoption

459
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
is a long way away.

460
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,840
Are you saying that VR's problem is the PC?

461
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,240
Yes, to some extent.

462
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,840
Geez, that makes me sad.

463
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,800
But the fact that you're blindfolded, you get these baby walkers that you can stand

464
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,920
in so you can now run around and walk around because you're sort of harnessed inside this

465
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
safe space.

466
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,240
The 360 degree-

467
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,080
It's just the solutions that are being created for this are just mental.

468
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,780
I've always thought the escapist aspect of it would be too overwhelming, too appealing

469
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:30,080
to deny, and that it would take off just because it would be like another drug.

470
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,280
It would be like another way to escape reality.

471
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,240
Yeah, I mean to me, that's not why it has problems.

472
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,880
That's why I want it.

473
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,480
It's putting me in a completely different reality.

474
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,480
It sounds fun, especially with those 360 degree treadmill stuff.

475
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,000
That's why I can see it in bigger places or community events or bars or venues and maybe

476
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,600
not in my home anytime soon.

477
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,360
Yeah, meanwhile though, AR is obviously going to get a lot of attention over the next year.

478
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,360
Especially in the industrial space.

479
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,820
Yeah, but it's the same thing about AR.

480
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:08,200
People have been saying AR is more interesting than VR, and it's basically gone nowhere.

481
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,920
The same amount of stuff.

482
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,400
I would be willing to bet you at dinner, the next time you're out in this neck of the woods

483
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,000
for an event, I'll bet you at dinner that by this time next year, we're talking a lot

484
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,600
more about AR just because of ARCore and ARKit.

485
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,320
Because ARKit is going to ship on every Apple device that supports iOS 11, which is going

486
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,880
to be 80% of the iPhones in the marketplace.

487
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,120
They're all going to have this AR capability.

488
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,920
And you know the new feature on the iPhone 8 is going to be dual cameras that have depth

489
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,640
sensing sensors that are going to support ARKit.

490
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,680
Yeah, but I don't want to experience augmented reality through my little phone screen.

491
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
No, no.

492
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
But maybe this is the trajectory.

493
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,760
Maybe you have to start here to get buy-off on this concept.

494
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,760
I don't know.

495
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
But do you want to-

496
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Go ahead.

497
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,080
Do you want to experience virtual reality sat down because it's the only safe way to

498
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,920
experience this reality?

499
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Yeah.

500
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,800
No, because that's the 360-

501
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
I'm kind of lazy though.

502
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,880
I mean, if I'm going to be in there for hours, I kind of want to sit down.

503
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,880
Wow.

504
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
That's true.

505
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,920
See, to me, the only compelling augmented reality thing, and I know I'm on Linux Unplugged,

506
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,440
it's the HoloLens.

507
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,400
If you're going to do AR, that is how you do it.

508
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Yeah.

509
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,040
And then on VR, we've still just got a bunch of tech demos.

510
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,760
There is no compelling titles.

511
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
If there was-

512
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,760
Oh, I disagree with you on that.

513
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
If there was-

514
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
You know what?

515
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
I have more faith-

516
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Rest of the sun's on VR.

517
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,820
I have more faith in ARCore that was announced today by Google than I do in HoloLens just

518
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,640
because Microsoft can't ship anything other than Azure.

519
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,280
That's the only thing they ship these days.

520
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,960
We had this conversation-

521
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
We should-

522
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Yeah, okay.

523
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
All right.

524
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,320
I have one thing I want to punt to you guys.

525
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,960
Minimac had an opinion about this in the pre-show.

526
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,040
I wanted to bring it up here.

527
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:02,120
Joe and I, Joe Resington and I, talked about Sailfish charging for their new ROM.

528
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:07,880
They're customizing for the Sony Xperia X. 50 pounds, I think it was, or I can't remember.

529
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
Actually, where's the price at?

530
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,880
50 euros.

531
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
50 euros.

532
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
I can't tell them apart.

533
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
I'm kidding.

534
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
What was the price?

535
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
What was the price?

536
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,000
I actually, in Linux Action News, I thought, shit, they should charge 100 because what

537
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,160
they're eventually promising is grade A support for the Sony Xperia X running Sailfish.

538
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
They're not there yet.

539
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,120
There's some of the sensors that don't work, Bluetooth doesn't work, but the idea is ongoing

540
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,920
support for this device, and they've included licensing for things like Exchange.

541
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,840
Minimac, you want to do a couple of follow-up points from Linux Action News.

542
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,360
2016, I think it was, if I'm recalling correctly.

543
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,720
Why don't you take some of the highlights there, and then maybe we'll kick it around

544
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
and see what other people had to add.

545
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
Yeah, thanks.

546
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,760
As mentioned before, I'm by no means a Sailfish developer.

547
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,960
I'm maybe a script kiddie for the Nexus 5 port, nothing more.

548
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,280
As you said in the show, the Xperia X is considered to be a first-class device for Sailfish OS.

549
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,480
That includes the license parts.

550
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,640
That means Android support, T9 root prediction, and Microsoft Exchange support.

551
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:19,400
One part of these 50 bucks is simply license fees, but there is a cool thing about it.

552
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:25,720
Jolla will publish the source code of the hardware adaptation layer called libhybris

553
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,600
for the device in the coming week or weeks.

554
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,220
There will be a free community port for the Sony Xperia X, and that is the cool thing

555
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:40,560
about it, because this is a milestone, the Xperia X is the first ARM 64-bit port of Sailfish

556
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:48,840
OS, and that might be the start of other Sony and other devices running 64-bit chipsets.

557
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,160
So they're doing the legwork to get this working on ARM 64.

558
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,400
Well, okay.

559
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,840
So what about Jolla's point then that, well, if there's a community version available,

560
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,600
where do they get off charging 50 bucks for it?

561
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,200
What's the incentive to pay for that?

562
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,320
I think that's what Jo's concern was, why would I pay 50 bucks for something I can get

563
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,320
for free?

564
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:14,440
I guess the idea is that you have software for Windows 10 and even Mac OS and Linux where

565
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:22,920
you can click install the ROM on your existing Sony Xperia X device in the future, but for

566
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:30,000
now you need a Linux computer, because right now you have to use a console for it.

567
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,900
Producer Michael, what are your thoughts about charging something like this for a ROM?

568
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,720
And let's just for sake of conversation say it was like lineage even, so something that's

569
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,840
super available, but it's just been totally designed for insert Android handset here,

570
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,760
and it's like perfectly designed for that, perfectly tuned.

571
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,160
I would say that it would be, the business model itself is not necessarily a bad thing.

572
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,160
If they were to say make a freemium version where you could get extra features for paying

573
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:01,000
for it, that'd be cool, but as long as it's not limiting the phone in any way, but it's

574
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,280
just like an extra thing, or it's more like if you want to support us, here's a way to

575
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,720
do that and buy this particular thing.

576
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
That kind of thing is fine.

577
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,200
I don't even care if they only did a premium and that's it.

578
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,680
I just don't like who it's coming from.

579
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,000
Tell me about that.

580
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,600
Well, I mean, I don't trust Yola.

581
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,160
You can't trust Yola, in my opinion, mainly because how much of this $50 is going back

582
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,120
to the money that they owe people for the tablet?

583
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,760
Well, I mean, yeah, okay, maybe.

584
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,500
If they still owe people like $100, $150 depending on what level they were in, why would anyone

585
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,800
trust them to buy a software that doesn't even work right now?

586
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:51,280
Yeah, you can put it on your system and also there's fundamental pieces that do not work.

587
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,840
I'm surprised to hear that because you in the United States have this thing that a company

588
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:03,040
can fail and Yola failed with the Yola tablet and I was one of the backer, but still they

589
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:08,400
live on and they try to continue and they try to do something which is really good for

590
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,520
the community.

591
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,800
So I can't agree with you really.

592
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,160
And most of the selfish always is open source.

593
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,520
When they pay money back to the people that they didn't get the money to, that would be

594
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
fine.

595
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,360
They are trying to, they are trying to.

596
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,120
Okay, good.

597
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:31,000
If they say how much money of this $50 per unit per purchase goes to that, that'd be

598
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
great.

599
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,360
But until they do that, we don't have any information except trust us.

600
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:43,740
No, they have a program which says when the Yola is making a profit, they will take a

601
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,700
part of this profit and pay back the backers.

602
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,560
So that was announced at the beginning of the year.

603
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,760
I don't really have an issue with the price either.

604
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,400
The price seems really reasonable.

605
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,520
So it seems like if this is how they're going to pay that back, yeah, it's going to take

606
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,520
them a while to do it.

607
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,000
If this is how they're going to, I bet a big part of how they're paying that back is coming

608
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,040
from the more business deals that they're, that was what I got when I did some digging

609
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,800
for Linux action news is they've lined up a couple of customization jobs for businesses

610
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,480
and that's going to pay some of that back.

611
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,960
But you're right, you don't really know.

612
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,960
You don't know.

613
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,040
If the software was ready to go when they announced this and it wasn't like, Hey, here's

614
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,440
these things that don't work.

615
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,960
And one of them happens to be very important to a lot of people, Bluetooth, like that,

616
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,840
that you, you need to fix that before you ship it.

617
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:38,100
And like if I would be interested because if they had, if this, if this ROM was fully

618
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,760
functional right out of the box and I don't have to wait for, for like some absurd, you

619
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,040
know, early adopter thing, if it's an early adopter, I'm just picking it up and then just

620
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
flashing it myself.

621
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
That's fine.

622
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,040
But if I have to flash it myself and have to pay for it, then I expect it to work because

623
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,520
it's a, it's a premium product.

624
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
Yeah.

625
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
Yeah.

626
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,960
But the Xperia, the Xperia X is a pretty reasonable price phone, $50 extra on top of that, still

627
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,720
way under the majority flagship phones.

628
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,680
So I would be interested as long as the ROM worked.

629
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,560
I have, I have good memories of Sailfish OS too.

630
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
All right.

631
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,160
Well, we should move on because we have, wrap it up, go ahead.

632
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,240
For Bluetooth, I think there are two problems with Bluetooth right now.

633
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,840
So first there have been big changes to the operating system.

634
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:28,960
They introduced Blues 5 for devices that have run kernels that run the Blues 5 API.

635
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,520
And the other problem might be the Qualcomm chipset, which is certified for Bluetooth

636
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,880
4.2.

637
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,960
So I guess they're just filling out these problems and maybe even the community can

638
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,920
help them to fill out these problems.

639
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,960
Well, Manny Mac, thank you for keeping us posted on that.

640
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,900
That is, that is good perspective and I appreciate it.

641
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:53,340
And if you want to know what sort of inspired this entire conversation, check out linuxactionnews.com.

642
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,000
We've got the latest stuff from there.

643
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,520
And if you think of anything else, let's, let's include it in the post show.

644
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,680
I think we should probably keep going.

645
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,680
There's like,

646
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,980
There's more to talk about today.

647
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,120
You made us an amazing show.

648
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,800
I mean, like, like, like we have so much more to get to, including, I want to, I really

649
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,160
want to unbox this, this Librem and check it out.

650
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,980
I have, I have really no idea what to expect.

651
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,000
So let's, let's talk about how we made this show possible.

652
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,480
It's our first sponsor this week and that's Linux Academy.

653
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,240
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

654
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,960
That's where you can sign up for a free seven day trial and support the show.

655
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,120
Linux Academy is a platform to learn more about Linux created by Linux enthusiasts.

656
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,440
From the basics all the way up to the big platforms that make the big bucks these days.

657
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,660
Linux Academy is really something special with human mentoring available, instructors

658
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,400
when you need it, and a community stack full of Jupiter broadcasting members.

659
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,280
Whether you're an experienced sys admin or new to the world of Linux, Azure and AWS,

660
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,600
OpenStack and DevOps, a sharp skill set is an absolute necessity to succeed.

661
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Meet Linux Academy, an online Linux and cloud training platform that uses self-paced video

662
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:06,720
courses and hands-on labs to give you real-world experience for a wide range of skills.

663
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,300
Train for your certification, learn the latest DevOps tools, and grow your skill set to do

664
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,400
better work.

665
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,280
Linux Academy is not just a video library.

666
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,160
Our scenario-based server labs and quiz system allow you to learn hands-on.

667
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,600
We also have full-time human instructors who answer questions and help you earn that certification

668
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,240
or promotion at work.

669
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,840
We add new training every week so you'll always be up to date on the latest tech.

670
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:36,940
Sys admins of every experience level use Linux Academy to stay on the bleeding edge of the

671
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,520
Linux ecosystem.

672
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,520
You should too.

673
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,740
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged, free seven-day trial, it is really a secret weapon.

674
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,680
I can only imagine if I could go back in time.

675
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,280
It'd be like if I was, if I was, uh, uh, Bic, or what's his name?

676
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,280
What's the guy's name?

677
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Bic?

678
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,280
Bic Tannen?

679
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,280
Yeah, I think it's Bic.

680
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
Is it Bic?

681
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
Why does it sound right?

682
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Is it Bif?

683
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,280
Bif.

684
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Bif.

685
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
Yeah, Bif.

686
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Bif.

687
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,040
Yeah, if I was Bif Tannen, if I was Bif Tannen and I had the sports almanac, only this would

688
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,040
be Linux Academy.

689
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,040
It would be a Linux Academy.

690
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,720
And I go back in time with Linux Academy and I'd know all the answers.

691
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
But now, of course, all them young whippersnappers.

692
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,480
You'd be like, hey, I'm really good with system D.

693
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,200
All them people looking for germs, all those people looking to get ahead, now they got

694
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Linux Academy.

695
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
You know what would be even better, Chris?

696
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
What?

697
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Is if you went back and you started Linux Academy.

698
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,480
Oh, I should have.

699
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,040
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

700
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
Thanks to them.

701
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,920
And sign up for a free seven-day trial.

702
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,200
All right, let's talk about a couple of quick things in Mumble Room.

703
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,960
Feel free to jump the F in if you got something even better that kind of conclude our conversation

704
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
about replacing LastPass.

705
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,440
Do you have any thoughts on remote backup, Wes, before we go any further?

706
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,560
Remote backup in general, because last week we had to talk about CrashPlan was dropping

707
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,600
their personal plan.

708
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,080
And that's sort of like that really good deal that lets you just send a ton of data up there.

709
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,660
And you got to get the F off the service.

710
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,040
We talked about different options.

711
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,200
Do you have any immediate thoughts?

712
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,960
Do you want to chime in anything on offsite backup on anything like that?

713
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,480
I mean, I think you guys did a pretty good job of rounding it up.

714
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,360
I use Tarsnap myself for some things.

715
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,440
And then I also have a couple of friends.

716
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,000
And we do have some, you know, set up some boxes that we can do R6 from, which works

717
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
pretty nicely.

718
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Yeah.

719
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Okay.

720
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
What about you, Beardsley?

721
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
There is one service that we didn't mention that I'm surprised we didn't mention.

722
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,120
At least I don't think we did.

723
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
And that's Backblaze.

724
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,280
Well, we mentioned in the context of B2 or whatever, because of their Linux support.

725
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
Yeah.

726
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
Yeah.

727
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,960
WSHacks wrote in on the subreddit and said, I'm surprised SpiderOak didn't come up, which

728
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,960
is my bad.

729
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,960
I'm a SpiderOak subscriber.

730
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:43,320
He says, it's one of the few consumer-focused backup services that I know of that has a

731
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,400
Linux client besides Tarsnap and Rclone.

732
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,560
The other options I looked at are rsync.net.

733
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,440
So that was what he had to add.

734
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,340
I know rsync.net now does, you can do like zfs send to them.

735
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,340
So that's pretty sweet.

736
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,340
That is.

737
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,340
If you have a big zfs array.

738
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,340
That is really sweet.

739
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,840
Alan Jude should get into something like that.

740
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Yeah, right?

741
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
That would be right in his wheelhouse.

742
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,520
Yeah, I'd send some bits over to Alan.

743
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,520
Yeah.

744
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
I just looked up Backblaze.

745
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,540
It is super damn cheap for B2.

746
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,320
It's half a cent per gigabyte per month.

747
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
Woo.

748
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,320
Woo.

749
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,400
So that's really, really.

750
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,400
But B2.

751
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
You're looking at B2?

752
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,400
Yeah, yeah.

753
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,520
So Rclone and whatnot does support B2.

754
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,400
Well, not only that, but they now have their own command line Linux client as well.

755
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
Is that right?

756
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
Yeah.

757
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
All right.

758
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,920
Now, Mr. Wimpy, you were going to make a mention about Enpass.

759
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:39,720
Yes, this isn't a backup utility, but an alternative to LastPass for storing your passwords.

760
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Which you probably need to back up.

761
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
Yeah.

762
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,240
And the way that Enpass works is unlike LastPass, they don't provide the cloud storage backend.

763
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,480
It's client software that runs on all the different platforms.

764
00:41:52,480 --> 00:42:00,000
And then you then sync your wallet with whatever backend file syncing service you choose to

765
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
use.

766
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Do you want to-

767
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Yeah.

768
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,180
And the price is very, it's free unless you want to do mobile stuff.

769
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,280
And then it's only like 10 bucks per device.

770
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,120
So Wimpy, do you feel like divulging what you've chosen to sync it with?

771
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:20,440
Well, I have it synced in Dropbox at the moment because it's all locally encrypted.

772
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,120
So there's nothing going into Dropbox that I need to worry about.

773
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,960
I was hoping you'd say because you hate freedom.

774
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,680
I knew there was a low chance, but I just thought that'd be really funny.

775
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,680
Yeah.

776
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,240
That's what I'm using too, myself.

777
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
Yeah.

778
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,080
Dropbox is still being used for a lot of stuff.

779
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,400
And for offsite backups, I'm using Rclone and S3.

780
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
Ah.

781
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
I am.

782
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Oh, and how are you liking that?

783
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,400
Yeah, very good.

784
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:51,080
I've also got Amazon photo storage and Amazon file storage through Amazon Prime.

785
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:56,400
And what I like about that is you can actually instigate cloud to cloud transfers.

786
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,520
You don't have to Rclone all of your stuff down locally and then push it somewhere.

787
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,720
You can actually clone it between cloud storage backends without having to pull it down.

788
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,720
Wow.

789
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,720
That is nice.

790
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
Yeah.

791
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,840
And I know you weren't here last week either.

792
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,880
Do you have any thoughts on offsite backup or want to share anything you've tried and

793
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,360
had success with?

794
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,280
So yeah, I don't do any offsite backup.

795
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,440
I do it all to a home server.

796
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,840
So yeah, if my house went up in flames, I'd lose everything.

797
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,840
That's bad.

798
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,640
And I keep not quite getting around to anything.

799
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,320
And I've tried most of these.

800
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,320
I've tried...

801
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,240
What was the one you mentioned, Spider Oak?

802
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,240
Yeah.

803
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,920
It's an atrocious user interface.

804
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:41,920
Yeah.

805
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,920
Slow too.

806
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
Yeah.

807
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,920
Yeah.

808
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,240
But I'm keen to know what other people use that are good and reliable and I can just

809
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,200
fire and forget and not have to faff about and worry about it with large volumes of data

810
00:43:53,200 --> 00:44:00,040
because I have a huge multi-terabyte array with all my backups on at home and I don't

811
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:02,680
know what to do with it.

812
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,680
So...

813
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,680
Hi ho.

814
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,680
What was that?

815
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,680
Hi, Chris.

816
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,680
It's Ben.

817
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,680
How are you doing?

818
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,680
Nice to see you, Ben.

819
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,760
Well, I just wanted to talk about this part of the show.

820
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,000
Well, I've always used...

821
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,280
I've used R Sync a couple of times and I've also used Google Drive and...

822
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,280
What else?

823
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,160
OneDrive and a couple of other different solutions.

824
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,440
And also, can I jump back to the Gen 2 part for just a minute?

825
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,000
I just wanted to say that I'm willing to help you on that front.

826
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
That's what I wanted to point out.

827
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Oh, you're gonna take the challenge with us?

828
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Welcome aboard.

829
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Yeah.

830
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Welcome aboard.

831
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,400
Well, I want to help you guys out at any point.

832
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,360
If you get stuck in the installation or anything like that, I'm willing to help.

833
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,760
Oh, I'm not so worried about that.

834
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,560
I mean, I feel like I can do that.

835
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,500
I feel like I'm more like I just want somebody to do it with us.

836
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,500
It's like, you know, when you're trying to...

837
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,680
Yeah, I'm willing to jump on board, that's fine, because I've installed it half a dozen

838
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,680
times.

839
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,440
I mean, Spatry even said I've installed it more times than people change things.

840
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,240
Well, okay.

841
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,040
So to our topic at hand here, so you're using R Sync to offsite what?

842
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,040
Like you're going...

843
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,040
Are you going to...

844
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,120
I mean, I've done a bunch of different Linux respins and different things like that and

845
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,120
different ISOs.

846
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:17,080
And I've helped out a couple of different people with their Linux respins and I've uploaded

847
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,080
stuff for them on R Sync and different stuff like that.

848
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,640
So yeah, I've uploaded several different files and stuff like that that I've had to back

849
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:32,280
up the different cloud sourcing like SourceForge, GitHub, different stuff like that with R Sync.

850
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,880
Surf Rock wrote into the show and he says, in regards to CrashPlan, eliminating home

851
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,240
accounts, he says, here's what led me to convert to a CrashPlan Pro account.

852
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,400
He did some soul searching, he did the math.

853
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,720
He looked at the fact that he's got a NAS server with 12 terabytes on it.

854
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,680
He's got some Dropbox systems that he wants to send offsite.

855
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,360
He's got a couple of machines he wants to back up.

856
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:59,960
He said, now I could do a single backup of my entire home to the local server, all over

857
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,080
like some sort of NFS or Samba mount.

858
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:07,720
And then still, trying to do all the math, he says, the best thing for me is to just

859
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,460
go for CrashPlan Pro.

860
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:17,780
It's 120 US greenbacks a year, but the backups not only capture all of your data, they also

861
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,000
capture all of the configs for all of the machines.

862
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,320
Which to him was sort of like the, ah, that's the sensor for me.

863
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:30,060
I want a utility that'll blast everything back to exactly the way it was, not just back

864
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,800
up the data, but everything the way it was.

865
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,280
And that's where CrashPlan Pro for him.

866
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:38,040
I mean, that's like on the more managed side of services, and in that scenario, I think

867
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,920
$120 a year, if you can afford it, is a reasonable amount for the kind of protection that you

868
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,920
get.

869
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,920
Yeah.

870
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,920
Yeah.

871
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:49,000
It comes always back to that question of how much do you, as a sys admin or a similar

872
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,320
person who can do some things, is this something you outsource or is it something you roll yourself?

873
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,000
He says when I kind of laid it all out with the wife, he says the spousal approval factor

874
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
is pretty high, especially when I mentioned the pictures.

875
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Yeah, right.

876
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,120
That's an important one, though.

877
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,480
We kind of invented digital cameras and then didn't come up with a reliable way to make

878
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,960
sure you could keep those pictures.

879
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,960
Yeah.

880
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
A Spider Oak.

881
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,480
So my thing has always been like, is what I use Spider Oak for is to back up Dropbox,

882
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,280
which is like, it's like my belt and suspenders approach to Dropbox, but it's really excessive

883
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,920
and it's really slow and it depends on one machine running that has both Spider Oak and

884
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,920
Dropbox installed.

885
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,920
It's like that's your sync machine.

886
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,960
Why can't one connect to the other and just do it like cloud to cloud, you know?

887
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,960
I mean, it's just servers.

888
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,800
It's not like they don't need some desktop.

889
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,800
It's all just Linux.

890
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,940
Do they really need a desktop PC in between?

891
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,320
They can't talk directly to each other?

892
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,320
Give me a break.

893
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,560
And of course, you're never going to get that with these closed source.

894
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,040
So one of the things that a lot of people wrote into the show, a lot of people wrote

895
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,520
into the show about was NextCloud.

896
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,680
I don't think we've ever gotten more people suggesting NextCloud ever than we did in response

897
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,920
to all of this.

898
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:00,120
Off-site sync, but the thing that people really brought up was that's where I store a lot

899
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,760
of my data that is resync.

900
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:10,240
So calendar, contacts, photos, notes, they just keep them on NextCloud and then they

901
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,680
reload the machine and then the NextCloud syncs that stuff back down.

902
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,880
That's a pretty good way to do it.

903
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:22,640
Yeah, but at the same time, like if it's critical data, I'm not like a security engineer or...

904
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,640
Are you sure?

905
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,160
That word's pretty legit.

906
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,440
I don't trust myself to be able to take care of that data.

907
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,200
That's why I'm wanting to offload it to another service.

908
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,200
Geez.

909
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Yeah.

910
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,200
Okay.

911
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,200
That's fair.

912
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:39,200
Yeah.

913
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,200
Because that's what they do.

914
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,200
Yeah.

915
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,200
That's their thing.

916
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,200
Yeah.

917
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,200
They spend their entire day doing that stuff.

918
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,400
I think that's what's sort of great about open source though is there is a good contingent

919
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,960
of us out there that we are...

920
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,520
I really kind of ebb and flow on it.

921
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,840
Some stuff I'm willing to maintain myself and some stuff I'm willing to just like sort

922
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,840
of off-site.

923
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,840
Yeah.

924
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,840
I agree.

925
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,600
For me, it varies depending on how important what you're doing.

926
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:04,640
How interested it is, how easy it is for you, and that kind of changes depending on what

927
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:05,640
you do.

928
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,040
How much it would hurt you if you lost it.

929
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,040
Right.

930
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,040
Right.

931
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,040
Yeah.

932
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,040
And backups though are...

933
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,240
What I really dream of is something that is like a, is this possible?

934
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,040
But maybe even like a 15-year system.

935
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,880
Is that just ridiculous?

936
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,880
These are your backups.

937
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,520
These are your photos, and your music, and your documents, and your creations.

938
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,480
You're going to want them for a while, right?

939
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,960
And in the past, they would have all been physical things that would have gone in boxes

940
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,500
that you would have stored somewhere ridiculously, and then your family would have to do something

941
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,720
with when you died.

942
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,720
But now I want...

943
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,840
And were you making three copies of that that you put at different people's houses?

944
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,840
Well, that's just it.

945
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,640
The longer I go, am I just building up more and more shit that I'm going to have to keep

946
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:50,160
converting to newer formats, drag to new cloud storage services, move to new types of open

947
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,120
source programs that come online, hosted by new cloud providers?

948
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,320
Am I just going to drag all this stuff with me?

949
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,400
And the thing is, is the more dispersed it is, the less control I have over it now, the

950
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,240
less flexibility I'll have down the road.

951
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:07,560
You see, so there is some logic to all of these people writing in saying, use Nextcloud,

952
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,760
because at least then you have some sort of escape hatch.

953
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,320
Like right now, I got a ton of stuff in Google, and Google's going to be around for a really

954
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,320
long time.

955
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,640
Will I be using Google services for 15 years?

956
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,640
I doubt it.

957
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:24,000
And at some point, I'm going to have to come to that reality of having to migrate all of

958
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,960
my crap out of their crap.

959
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,520
Well, even with like, I've had that with the Dropbox.

960
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,320
I just kind of just stopped using Dropbox at one point.

961
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,840
I still had stuff in it.

962
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,960
And then I have to make sure that my account stays open, or I have to then make sure that

963
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,960
I migrate.

964
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,960
So there are past issues.

965
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,520
I did go through my entire Dropbox and remove everything.

966
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,520
Mm-hmm.

967
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,680
I think this is why some of us feel compelled to build like super NASes in our houses and

968
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:50,000
just get something that has a ton of disk, and like Popey, just mine CryptoCoin and have

969
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,120
a bunch of disks, and just keep it all local.

970
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:57,200
You could Vericrypt stuff, maybe, and put stuff on these services.

971
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,160
And use, of course, CFS to prevent bit rot.

972
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,080
Well, that's just important.

973
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,480
I'll just take a nap and let it back up to tar snap.

974
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,160
I don't want to lose my Whopper coins.

975
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,600
Well, you know, and a lot of them are like, duh, Chris, Nextcloud on DigitalOcean.

976
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,680
I don't know if you've heard, Chris, but DigitalOcean is a really easy and quick way to spin up

977
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,720
droplets in less than 55 seconds.

978
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,200
Install BSD and get ZFS and SSDs.

979
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,200
All right.

980
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,440
So now this is sponsor time right here.

981
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,440
DigitalOcean.com.

982
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,920
Go over there, create an account, and use our promo code DOUNPLUGS.

983
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,880
You'll get a $10 credit, and then you can spin up their $5 rig.

984
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,800
I love their $0.03 an hour machine, because you get a lot of resources and a lot of memory

985
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,780
and a lot of core and a lot of everything for $0.03 an hour.

986
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:47,480
Everything you deploy will use SSDs from their really nice, low-end, like, you can't even

987
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,280
believe how little you're paying for it systems, all the way to the systems that are monsters.

988
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,560
Have you seen, like, their 200-plus gigabyte RAM systems and their new high CPU systems?

989
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,560
High CPU.

990
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,560
Yeah.

991
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,760
And you can manage it all with a simple API, which means if you start getting more and

992
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,320
more droplets, which does eventually happen, because they're great for everything.

993
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,680
You can deploy them all over the world.

994
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,840
You can get set up in seconds.

995
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,500
You can get started with an entire open source stack or a single low-level OS.

996
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,040
You're going to end up using the API.

997
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,720
And the API is so well done, you're going to love it.

998
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,720
Lightning fast networking, highly available storage.

999
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,120
You can attach as you need up to 16 terabytes, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and

1000
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,120
use the FS.

1001
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:27,200
And use the FS, just like the beard was saying, because it shows up as a block storage device,

1002
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,880
and you could use that.

1003
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,960
Or you know what?

1004
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,960
You know what?

1005
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,040
You could make the SUSE folks happy, and you could use ButterFS.

1006
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,040
You sure could.

1007
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,040
You could play around with it.

1008
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:38,040
You know, I hear RAID 5 and 6 are pretty popular.

1009
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,040
Give that a go.

1010
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,040
See, the nice thing about DO is once you get tired of that, you just blow it away.

1011
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,680
One button click, one API call, it's gone.

1012
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,680
Yeah.

1013
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:50,120
And something that the ButterFS folks really love is they also have snapshots.

1014
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,000
So you can take snapshots of your system before you create some sort of a fence.

1015
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,840
In fact, because that API is really nice and well-documented, you'll find that there's

1016
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:04,160
open source projects that might integrate with your package manager that will actually

1017
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:09,600
take a snapshot of your DigitalOcean droplet before it installs all your packages.

1018
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,520
So if something blows up, you can revert right back.

1019
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,520
That's awesome.

1020
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,840
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1021
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,640
Big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1022
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:23,520
And thanks to everybody out there for using the DOUNPLUGGED promo code after they create

1023
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,540
their account at DigitalOcean.com.

1024
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:30,440
So this week, the smoke was revealed from, I'm sorry, the fire was revealed from the

1025
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:37,040
smoke that is the Librem 5, and the Librem 5 is Purism's attempt to build a GNU slash

1026
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:44,620
Linux powered open source phone that respects your privacy and your GNU slash freedoms.

1027
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:49,660
Now it's going to start around $600, which is actually a pretty reasonable price for

1028
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,520
a bonafide smartphone.

1029
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,080
That's the world we live in.

1030
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:59,120
And it's got one interesting element that out of all of the things about it impressed

1031
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:05,920
me, is its support for matrix phone calling.

1032
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:11,800
Now I have quite a bit of skepticism about a fundraiser for $1.5 million for a smartphone

1033
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,160
in 2017.

1034
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,240
But I thought before we really even go there, I thought I'd tell you a little bit about

1035
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,320
it.

1036
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:24,640
They say it'll be the world's first IP native mobile handset for a new kind of cord cutter.

1037
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,280
And that cord cutter is one that's cutting the cord from the cellular network, which

1038
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:33,040
I actually feel like is not to make this a sponsor thing, but sort of why I use Ting,

1039
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,300
because I just pay for what I use, and I try not to use the cellular network, because screw

1040
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,120
the cellular networks.

1041
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,120
Screw those carriers.

1042
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,360
And so Ting is sort of like my hack around that.

1043
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,640
And now apparently it just turns out I'm a new kind of cord cutter hipster.

1044
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,760
I didn't even know it.

1045
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,680
And all of you Ting users out there didn't even know it.

1046
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,600
And you're not going to get credit for it either, don't worry.

1047
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:55,200
And the other thing about this phone is it's not shipping iOS, it's not shipping Android,

1048
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,360
it's shipping PureOS, which is their Linux distribution.

1049
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:04,300
They're working with the Matrix Project to get that calling and texting.

1050
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,320
It's going to be like a full-fledged messaging platform.

1051
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,320
It's not just phone calls.

1052
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,000
It's going to have a five-inch screen.

1053
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,440
It'll have hardware kill switches for the camera, microphone, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and

1054
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,440
the baseband.

1055
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,440
That's a lot of switches.

1056
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,440
It is a lot of switches.

1057
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,720
It's kind of like spiky on the outside of the phone.

1058
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,720
Maybe.

1059
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,720
I'm wondering.

1060
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,720
I'm wondering about that.

1061
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,720
They're going to have a separate CPU and baseband.

1062
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,720
They're going to have...

1063
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,720
Really?

1064
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,720
Mm-hmm.

1065
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,720
Now, that's something.

1066
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:37,720
So, what do you think, Wes, 2017, to get in, to get a phone of any real substance, to get

1067
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:44,560
a phone and a charger, you got to back it at $599, $600 US, and estimated delivery is

1068
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,120
January of 2019.

1069
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:51,200
That's a long, that's a ways away.

1070
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,240
And I wonder, it just seems like there's been a hard time in the past to get these things.

1071
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,160
Like right now, if I could have that phone right now, yeah, all right, that seems great.

1072
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,160
I would try it.

1073
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,160
I would use it.

1074
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,160
I'm curious about it.

1075
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,160
A lot of that appeals to me.

1076
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,660
But that's a long time.

1077
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,640
We've seen things slip in these kinds of projects.

1078
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:11,200
And the money I'm paying is money today, will that really have sold the same value in a

1079
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,680
year and a half or whatever?

1080
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,680
Yeah.

1081
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,680
Yeah.

1082
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,480
This was a pledge that you could get this, they know that there's people who want to

1083
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:22,240
do it and are willing to give them money, but not taking the money even when the campaign's

1084
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,320
over, waiting until it's actually like a physical thing.

1085
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,880
That I'd be happy to do.

1086
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:33,860
But $600 for a phone in a year and a half, no thanks.

1087
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:40,200
What about something that sort of shakes up the whole iOS, Android death grip?

1088
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,960
No, as far as PureS is, what they're saying that they're doing is amazing.

1089
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:48,480
Like there are certain aspects of this phone that I would love it, especially the separate

1090
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:55,380
baseband thing, because that brings so much potential to the mobile platform as the Linux

1091
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:59,320
mobile advocate that I want to be.

1092
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,640
That is something that was fundamentally important.

1093
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,640
$1.5 million.

1094
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,480
55 days to go.

1095
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,920
They've raised 8.55% as we record.

1096
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:18,760
That's 128,000.

1097
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,480
So I think I was a backer of their first fundraiser.

1098
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,000
I think that's how I got the Librem 15.

1099
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,340
It's been a little while now.

1100
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,360
The reason why I lose track is because I've kind of lost track of how many fundraisers

1101
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,460
there's been, because I think there's been a couple of different fundraising campaigns

1102
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:38,760
at this point for different hardware, and I've kind of lost track.

1103
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,600
I don't know if this is a bad thing or not.

1104
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:45,280
Does it become a red flag if you're three or four fundraisers in?

1105
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,360
Does that indicate that perhaps this is starting to become a business model in which that every

1106
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:52,720
few years, or every year or so, you have to do a fundraiser to keep going?

1107
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,040
That was one thing I was kind of bring up, is I would almost have more confidence in

1108
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,840
this, at least kind of with the Yala stuff, it feels like there is more of this business

1109
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,720
angle and I can kind of get on board, or I have a little more faith that that will have

1110
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,160
the sort of traction or momentum to influence the industry, or at least take a bite out

1111
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,160
of it.

1112
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:13,080
So like you're saying, this sort of intermittent funding model, does that have the same sort

1113
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:16,600
of staying power that we need to actually get market share, which is what you need to

1114
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,920
get apps that people want and users that are using it?

1115
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:25,080
I guess it's a way to maybe fish out consumer demand before you go all in on a product,

1116
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,080
perhaps?

1117
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:32,360
Well, to me, it just looks more like they aren't making enough money that they can be

1118
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,940
able to do these projects themselves.

1119
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:38,400
Whether that's true or not, that's the perception it gives me.

1120
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,400
Hmm.

1121
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,120
Wimby, you're suggesting that they've created their own funding platform.

1122
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,120
I guess I hadn't noticed.

1123
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,120
You're right.

1124
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,120
This isn't Kickstarter IndieGoGo, is it?

1125
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:49,560
No, it's that they're using their own platform and I'm just wondering what people feel about

1126
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,560
that.

1127
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:56,080
Because if you're taking the money and managing it yourself, do we lose some of the oversight

1128
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:01,880
and having a place to go that's independent of the organization looking for the funding?

1129
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,520
And does it suggest this is going to be something that happens more often?

1130
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,520
Go ahead, Bobby.

1131
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,120
It also means that there's no publicly visible feedback.

1132
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:17,320
Like when I go to a Kickstarter or an IndieGoGo or many of the others, I know I can go and

1133
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:25,160
have a look in the conversations that people are having in the comments and the comments

1134
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,240
underneath the updates to see what the general feel of that project is before I'm going to

1135
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,240
back it.

1136
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,640
So all I've got is the mouthpiece of the people who are making the project, I'm less inclined

1137
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:38,680
to feel I want to contribute to that thing.

1138
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:42,720
And they don't actually provide any policy information like what their structure of payment

1139
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,720
is either.

1140
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,920
Well, okay.

1141
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,560
Not only that, but it doesn't make a whole lot of business sense to them because aren't

1142
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:54,440
they limiting their number of eyes to the people that visit their site?

1143
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,640
Well, and maybe they're just hoping that social outreach will...

1144
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,240
How do you really get people to your Kickstarter page?

1145
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,240
You've got to get...

1146
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:06,440
I think they had to do this in order to be FSF friendly.

1147
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:11,940
You can't make a fully pure, fully free software device and then say, come on to this non-free

1148
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:16,480
platform in order to back the thing like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo because they're all completely

1149
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,480
non-free.

1150
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,800
I think one of them was on crowd supply, but I can see why they would want to do it on

1151
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,200
their own site, but it smells a bit bad to me.

1152
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,600
It's not the first people to do that though because the new PG people did it as well.

1153
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,960
But I mean, okay, so that is an interesting thing to be aware of and something to consider.

1154
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:41,720
I mean, it does mean that you bypass whatever rules are in place, like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo

1155
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,320
have certain criteria that must be met before you can just...

1156
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,840
You can't just throw any old project.

1157
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:51,160
I mean, it looks like that on IndieGoGo sometimes, but you can't just throw your project on there.

1158
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:56,640
There are some rules and there's some opportunity for recourse if things go bad.

1159
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:04,280
What opportunity for recourse do we have directly with purism themselves if there's no intermediary

1160
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:11,060
who can say, this project went south and you need to provide some kind of remuneration

1161
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:16,760
for the people who were done out of their cold hard cash.

1162
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,760
We also don't know if it's like a Kickstarter style or if it's like the IndieGoGo where

1163
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,600
you can do both fixed or you get it automatically regardless if they meet the thing or not.

1164
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:29,480
Fix and flex.

1165
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:35,480
So outside of the payment platform, I mean, is there a bitterness developing around this

1166
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:42,080
concept or is there still enthusiasm amongst us all gathered here today for a open source

1167
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:45,600
Linux powered handset that you can in theory load any distro.

1168
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:49,280
This one will be shipping with a Debian derivative, which would support hooking up a mouse and

1169
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:55,200
keyboard and an HDMI device and quote unquote convergence if you want to start X.

1170
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:59,680
The claim that it can run any Linux distribution is an interesting one given that it's an MX

1171
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,400
board and therefore it would need, you'd need to have a target for that platform.

1172
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,400
It's an ARM board.

1173
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,640
The reason why it would be ARM, yeah.

1174
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:13,920
Technically any distro could run on it, but in practice somebody would have to enable

1175
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,440
that hardware for that distro.

1176
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:20,480
Well they also, because of the baseband that, because they're doing a separated baseband

1177
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,440
with the firmware built into it, like that kind of.

1178
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,680
I understand that, but I'm just talking generally, you know, just, just everything about the

1179
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,680
board.

1180
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,160
If something's not based on ARM for sure.

1181
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,160
Yeah.

1182
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,160
Who is that?

1183
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,160
Who is that?

1184
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,160
Oh, is that Poppy?

1185
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,160
Oh, Poppy, you're breaking up.

1186
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,160
Hold on.

1187
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,160
Say it again.

1188
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,160
Oh, sorry.

1189
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,160
Go again.

1190
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,160
Yeah, there you go.

1191
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,160
Now you're clear.

1192
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,040
So the thing that gets me is this is basically just a small computer.

1193
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:49,160
Like the GPD pocket that people have been raving about, the small computer that has

1194
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:54,000
an HD display and a full size keyboard is like a tiny, tiny netbook-y kind of thing.

1195
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,680
It's not a distant step from that to the Purism device, right?

1196
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:04,640
It's the, there are tricky things because it's a, it's got no hardware keyboard and

1197
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:10,360
it's going to be used in a pocket with expected long battery life, but there's not a giant

1198
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:15,960
leap from existing hardware that can run general purpose Linux operating systems like the GPD

1199
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,960
pocket can.

1200
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,960
Okay.

1201
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,300
Modulo busted drivers for various things, but that'll get fixed.

1202
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:26,960
There's not a big leap from there to a mobile device that can run general purpose Linux

1203
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,280
operating systems.

1204
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:32,520
And we're talking some time away for this thing to be delivered.

1205
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,880
So it's not unreasonable to think that that could be delivered.

1206
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,880
I agree.

1207
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:42,880
I, I, and, uh, I tell you, I agree with all of you that said that if it was shipping today,

1208
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,680
it's something I would definitely consider purchasing.

1209
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,680
Yeah.

1210
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,960
I'd already be having it in my cart right now and checking it out.

1211
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:57,000
You know, something I did notice about their announcement was they are not committing to

1212
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,960
specific hardware as well.

1213
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:02,960
Which-

1214
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,960
Or functionality.

1215
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,960
Yeah.

1216
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,400
It clearly states everything is subject to change.

1217
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,400
Yeah.

1218
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:14,520
So it's, it's like they're asking you to back it, but they're also not committing to delivering

1219
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,120
you a specific product, which is really worrisome to me.

1220
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,320
Well, in a sense, like you could say that maybe because they don't want to commit to

1221
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:26,440
the hardware specs because in a year from now or something like that, or six months

1222
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:31,640
from now, the hardware specs would be, would be so much different that they wanted to upgrade.

1223
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,960
And if they already committed to a certain thing, people would expect that this way they

1224
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,680
could say, well, we're going to upgrade it automatically and then you're going to get

1225
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,360
a better, more RAM or a different type of RAM or something like that.

1226
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,360
Yeah.

1227
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:45,540
Well, just, just the other day, uh, they, uh, did an update on their blog and they said

1228
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:50,680
that, uh, the general interest in the fundraiser so far has kind of got us talking more with

1229
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,900
hardware manufacturers.

1230
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:59,920
And based on their post here, what I grok is that they have a rough idea of what they're

1231
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,920
targeting.

1232
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,920
They're targeting the processor.

1233
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,400
They, I think it's going to be about four gigs of RAM and then they have a couple of

1234
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,080
rough ideas, but I don't think they're super committing yet because it's all subject to

1235
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,360
change because it is so far out.

1236
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:10,960
I think that's pretty much it.

1237
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:18,880
Um, I wonder if we will be in not too distant future in a position where these kinds of

1238
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,840
crowdfunding campaigns will be able to essentially print a device like this every time somebody

1239
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,920
backs it.

1240
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,520
So the moment you back it, it's just on demand manufacturing.

1241
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:35,200
You don't have to secure 1.5 million orders because you don't have to preorder 300,000

1242
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,200
units.

1243
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,780
You can, you can just print out a unit as they're, and of course printing, I'm using

1244
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:46,720
loosely as a way to automate manufacturing, but you do have to wonder when will that scale

1245
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,460
get to a point where they can do one-to-one ordering and it doesn't require a huge batch

1246
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:56,200
purchase that has to be planned out for a year in advance because in some ways it feels

1247
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:02,120
like that's what's holding back true unfettered development of a free Linux phone.

1248
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:09,400
Because you would need something that was reasonably priced, that was reasonably functional,

1249
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,120
and that people could actually get their hands on immediately.

1250
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:16,480
So the moment it started to tip into popularity, people could start ordering it.

1251
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,520
Like a Raspberry Pi Zero or a Raspberry Pi when they were brand new.

1252
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:25,400
Like those, there was a tipping point where resources were limited, but there were ways

1253
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:32,960
to get your hands on it, and that's not possible for companies like Purism.

1254
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,800
They're in this position trying to get off the ground with a new product like this.

1255
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:41,800
I mean, to be fair, you could think about the fact that they don't have to set up deals

1256
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,460
with different companies and OEMs and all this other stuff because they're not making

1257
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:51,660
a software like an OS for a plethora of devices.

1258
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:54,280
They're making one device and one OS for that device.

1259
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,920
So Michael, what do you think?

1260
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:03,400
If this doesn't work, is this dream dead?

1261
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:08,760
No, I don't think it's dead because of UBports and Plasma Mobile, what they're doing, and

1262
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,040
the Holium project is awesome.

1263
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,480
So it's just going to be a different version of the dream.

1264
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,160
Instead of having the one ideal device you can buy that just comes all ready to go, it's

1265
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,080
going to be you buy the hardware and then load your OS.

1266
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,080
Right.

1267
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,720
It's going to be flash it yourself kind of thing.

1268
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,720
Yeah.

1269
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,520
It's going to work for Linux on the desktop, I guess.

1270
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:27,520
Yeah.

1271
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:32,320
I think that's the most likely to happen in general, especially because all the projects,

1272
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:36,480
especially ones that are working together, like the Holium project is a collaborative

1273
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,700
project to work with multiple different approaches.

1274
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,240
So I like that.

1275
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:46,400
But I hope Purism is successful in this and makes a fantastic device because I would really

1276
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,400
love to do it.

1277
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:55,800
I just can't convince myself to pay $600 for a dream.

1278
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,320
But I hope other people have money to risk on that.

1279
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:03,480
So feel free to back it so I can eventually get it.

1280
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:08,120
Well speaking of their hardware, arriving just in time for the show to give you a first

1281
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:13,040
impression is what appears to be a brand new laptop from Purism.

1282
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,560
So we'll talk about that in just a moment.

1283
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:19,600
Any closing thoughts, gentlemen, in the Mumble Room on the CrowdFunder?

1284
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,480
Anybody that decided to back it want to chime in?

1285
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,560
I'll kick it to you for final comment.

1286
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,100
I really wish them all success.

1287
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:35,900
Having worked on a phone that didn't succeed, I know this is hard, really hard.

1288
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:42,080
And even if you have a lot of people who are willing you on and are willing to get you

1289
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:48,000
like a significant chunk of the way, like Ubuntu Edge got $12 million towards the $30

1290
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
million target.

1291
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,120
And I know we didn't hit the target, but we got phones out in the market and we got an

1292
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,040
operating system out there.

1293
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,920
It was a lot of hard work and I think they're going to need a lot of help to get this done.

1294
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,360
I wish them all the best.

1295
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:06,320
Todd says, just a few years later, all you need is $1.5 million now instead of $30 million.

1296
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:09,200
Do you have any thoughts on that?

1297
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:17,320
I don't know the mobile market well enough to know if that's actually true or whether

1298
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,320
you'd get this.

1299
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:22,800
I mean, bear in mind, these are two wildly different devices.

1300
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:31,640
The Ubuntu Edge was a unicorn and with everything that phones now already have, but for a general

1301
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,640
purpose device.

1302
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,640
Right.

1303
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:39,320
So, I don't think, I think it's probably reasonable to say the numbers are lower.

1304
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,320
Yeah.

1305
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,760
The phone that they're going to be using is an ODM part, so I imagine most of this money

1306
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,360
will go into funding the required software development.

1307
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,000
Oh, okay.

1308
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Well, we will have links in the show notes and I definitely would say I'm in the camp

1309
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,680
if somebody would love to see this work out.

1310
01:09:54,680 --> 01:10:00,080
To your point about the manufacturing, it seems like it's a shame that the way it's

1311
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,800
gone never really involved the Linux Foundation because it seems like some sort of group like

1312
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:08,080
that or something that could, for spanning multiple projects, facilitate and build those

1313
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,880
reliable connections to the actual manufacturing community because we do it like re-spin these

1314
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,880
up every time.

1315
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,280
It just can't scale.

1316
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,320
Maybe somebody's run the numbers and said, we're going to focus on the card instead.

1317
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:18,320
Right.

1318
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,320
Exactly.

1319
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,320
Oh, I don't know.

1320
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,840
I don't know, but I'll tell you what.

1321
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,080
If they ever ship it, I'll run it on Ting.

1322
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,080
Go over to...

1323
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,080
Were you going to say something?

1324
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,080
Do you want to...

1325
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,080
No.

1326
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,080
Oh, okay.

1327
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:32,280
Linux.ting.com, Linux.ting.com.

1328
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,440
Not to get a burger, although that does sound delicious right now, but to get something

1329
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:41,000
even cheaper and that's your mobile service plan for just $23 per month.

1330
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,320
That's the average cost of a Ting plan.

1331
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,280
That includes your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

1332
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:50,400
The reason why is it starts at just $6 a month and then it's your usage on top of that.

1333
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:54,560
Nationwide coverage, no contracts, no quote unquote agreements.

1334
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,400
You just pay for any pairs that you use.

1335
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,280
And by pairs, I mean minutes, messages, or megabytes.

1336
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,280
That's what I call them now.

1337
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:04,760
A fair price for however much you talk, however much you text, or however much data you use.

1338
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,400
You're always in control with their great tools, both on phone and their web app.

1339
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,480
You can buy a device directly from Ting.

1340
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,480
Really nice.

1341
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,080
The whole line of solid devices.

1342
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:18,840
Things that I think often people don't think of immediately when they think about getting

1343
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,600
like a value Android device.

1344
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,240
Ting is really good about spotting devices that are going to get updates or they got

1345
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,160
good functionality or they got great battery life and they're a great value.

1346
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:30,800
Of course, they've also got all the Cadillac devices, both on the iOS and Android side.

1347
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,880
They have really fantastic customer service.

1348
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,520
But my favorite feature of Ting is paying for what I use.

1349
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:43,520
Because I feel like I am that hipster cord cutter for the new mobile age.

1350
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,000
I live on Wi-Fi.

1351
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I live on Wi-Fi.

1352
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,600
I download my podcast before I leave.

1353
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,480
I pin my music to my device.

1354
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:54,720
I have photos backed up only when I'm on Wi-Fi.

1355
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,320
It's perfect for when I'm on the go.

1356
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,480
All of it's local.

1357
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,160
I don't want to be on the phone anymore when I'm driving anyways.

1358
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,560
Those are really only times I'm off Wi-Fi these days.

1359
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,760
Or if I may be out shopping or doing something on the holidays.

1360
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,240
That's why it's perfect for Ting to fill in the gaps.

1361
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:15,120
CDMA and GSM networks, no contracts, no other termination fee, just $6 a month plus Uncle

1362
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,680
Sam's tax and then whatever you use.

1363
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,040
I love it.

1364
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,120
Some months I'm a little busier.

1365
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,720
Some months I'm not busy at all at all.

1366
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:23,720
Really average.

1367
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,080
Still end up saving money.

1368
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,080
It's amazing.

1369
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,440
Also when you're over at Ting, linux.ting.com, check out their blog.

1370
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:33,840
They got a blog post about Ting offering internet, home internet service in the future.

1371
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,840
Once?

1372
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,840
Yeah.

1373
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,840
Read about that.

1374
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,840
I'm just going to have to move right over there.

1375
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,840
Linux.ting.com.

1376
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:43,280
So just in time for the show, the Librem came in here.

1377
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,760
This I believe is a replacement for the one that I kick started a long time ago that had

1378
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,760
some cooling issues.

1379
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,760
Do you want to do the honors of the unboxing?

1380
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,040
Oh sure.

1381
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:55,320
I did a little uncutting of the tape so that way you wouldn't have to like futz with that

1382
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,320
on the show.

1383
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:01,160
But ladies and gentlemen, right now Mr. Wes Payne is extracting a sub box from an outer

1384
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,660
white box.

1385
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:04,720
It says nothing but purism on it.

1386
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:05,720
He pulls it out.

1387
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,880
It says notebook on the box.

1388
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:08,600
All right, Wes.

1389
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:13,360
This looks like your average laptop box just as you would expect.

1390
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:16,720
I would turn on the inside webcam but our Logitech camera died.

1391
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:21,240
If anybody has any recommendations for really great wide angle high definition cameras that

1392
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:24,000
work really well under Linux, tweet me at Chris Elias.

1393
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,000
All right.

1394
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,520
So he's opening up the sub box right now.

1395
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,900
What are your initial impressions, Wes?

1396
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:29,900
Very normal packaging.

1397
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:30,900
Seems fine.

1398
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,360
Looks like I bought an Acer at Costco.

1399
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,360
Does it feel cold?

1400
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,360
Is it metal?

1401
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,360
Can you tell?

1402
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,360
Oh it does feel cold.

1403
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,360
Yeah.

1404
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,360
There we go.

1405
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,360
Is it in a plastic wrap there?

1406
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:41,360
It is, yes.

1407
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,360
Styrofoam on the sides.

1408
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,360
Nicely safe.

1409
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,360
It was not damaged.

1410
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,360
Is it heavy?

1411
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,160
I mean it feels sturdy.

1412
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,160
In plastic case.

1413
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,160
Let's get this out.

1414
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,160
Oh yeah.

1415
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,160
It's dark.

1416
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,160
It's dark.

1417
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,160
I'd say it's like a black metal.

1418
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,160
It's like a midnight.

1419
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:59,160
It's got that same, you know, there's nothing on the top surface which I kind of like.

1420
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,160
It's elegant.

1421
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:02,800
Oh, look at that.

1422
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,800
So let's see.

1423
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:10,920
We've got DC power in, two USB three slots, headphone jack, SD card reader on the side,

1424
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:17,320
and then two more USB ports, HDMI out, and USB-C. Interesting.

1425
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:18,320
Not much else though.

1426
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,320
There's the power adapter.

1427
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,600
It doesn't appear to be much of a manual or anything else.

1428
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,600
How big is the power brick?

1429
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,600
Just say that.

1430
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:24,600
Oh, not too bad.

1431
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,600
No, not bad at all.

1432
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,600
Pretty standard.

1433
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:27,600
Yeah.

1434
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,600
Yeah.

1435
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,120
So it's got a pretty big trackpad.

1436
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,240
Typical barrel type power plug here.

1437
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,240
Purism button there.

1438
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:37,560
Oh, and there's those, there is those classic kill switches.

1439
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,860
So look at there in the latch, in the hinge of the laptop.

1440
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:43,800
You see the kill switches right here along the, just underneath the screen.

1441
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,800
Oh, yeah.

1442
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,800
Look at that.

1443
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,800
Yeah.

1444
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:47,800
That's actually not a bad place for them.

1445
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:48,800
It's out of the way.

1446
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,800
Yeah.

1447
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,600
So this thing has a sixth-generation i7 processor and it's using Intel graphics.

1448
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:56,040
I think it has 16 gigs of RAM and an SSD in there for the storage.

1449
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,680
I'll do a full review after I've had a chance to play with it.

1450
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,680
I just got it before the show.

1451
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:04,080
There's a little reset button on the bottom too, so that's like a physical reset.

1452
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,280
Like a classic PC reset button.

1453
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,280
I kind of like that actually.

1454
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,280
Yeah.

1455
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,280
That is kind of nice.

1456
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,240
I think it's using DDR4 RAM too, which should be, you know, nice and fast.

1457
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:15,240
What do you think about the weight and feel of it?

1458
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,520
And maybe give a try of that keyboard too.

1459
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,620
I was trying to think of how, I'd say it's like an old-style MacBook keyboard.

1460
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:25,560
So not the new, like the really, not the new really flat touch bar keyboard, but like the,

1461
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:26,560
if anybody's tried those.

1462
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,560
Yeah, right.

1463
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:28,560
Yeah.

1464
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:29,560
Not like that.

1465
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,560
You're right.

1466
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,560
It is kind of like that.

1467
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:32,560
Not too much flex.

1468
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,560
Or like a later-generation, not like a great ThinkPad keyboard, but like one of the more

1469
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,560
modern ThinkPad keyboards.

1470
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,560
Yep.

1471
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,240
The travel's not amazing.

1472
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,960
I don't particularly like this enter key.

1473
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,280
Some keys seem to be a little better than others.

1474
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,720
What do you think about that trackpad though?

1475
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:42,720
That's pretty good.

1476
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:43,720
Yeah, not bad.

1477
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:48,480
Big size, nicely offset, and it's a little less smooth than I think I would like.

1478
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,480
You want to hit the power button?

1479
01:15:49,480 --> 01:15:50,480
But it works.

1480
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,480
You see it there?

1481
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:52,480
I don't know where it is.

1482
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:53,480
I don't know where it is on that thing.

1483
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:54,480
Top right.

1484
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,480
Go ahead and power it up.

1485
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,480
Let's see if it's got a charge.

1486
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,480
It should be loaded with Pure OS.

1487
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,480
Yep.

1488
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,480
It looks like it's powering up.

1489
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,480
Wow.

1490
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,480
Boom.

1491
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,480
Right there.

1492
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,480
There's the Purism logo right there.

1493
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,480
Boom.

1494
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:06,480
Wow.

1495
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:07,480
And it looks like it's going right into a mem test.

1496
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:08,480
I'm not sure.

1497
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,800
It looks like it booted right into mem test.

1498
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,800
Maybe that's all that's on there.

1499
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,600
That might be the hall that's installed.

1500
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,200
It's just mem test because it just booted right into mem test.

1501
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,520
I'm good with that actually.

1502
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,520
That's fine with me.

1503
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,520
I don't know what to put on there though.

1504
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:23,600
So that becomes, maybe that's what I should put Gen 2 on.

1505
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,800
I thought I'd be trying out Pure OS again.

1506
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:27,800
Maybe it is.

1507
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:31,440
So is that just like their customized like firmware image there that has their, I thought

1508
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,680
that was going to be a Linux boot order.

1509
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:33,960
Or it's just an image on the disk.

1510
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,440
A rumor has it that beta 1 of 1710 is coming out soon.

1511
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,880
That might be what I put 1710 on.

1512
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,440
And by the way, it's silent.

1513
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,440
You hear that?

1514
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,440
That's silent.

1515
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:49,080
You know, I got to give them credit.

1516
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,280
You know, it took them a few years, but they really came through.

1517
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,920
There is a fan in the same spot on the bottom pretty much.

1518
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,560
To be fair, the other one was pretty silent until you put it under any load.

1519
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,560
No, no.

1520
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,560
No, it was 24.

1521
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,560
It was always.

1522
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,560
It was just full.

1523
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,000
You booted on it, it was full blast.

1524
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
You're thinking of the Galago.

1525
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,720
You're thinking of the Galago Pro.

1526
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:12,080
Yeah, no, the Librem was just full blast.

1527
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:16,560
So the other thing that I really got to give them credit for here is they also sent us

1528
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,640
the Librem 13.

1529
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,880
They sent it to Noah.

1530
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,720
And he didn't give it the best of review.

1531
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:27,000
So in the face of all of that, you got to give them credit for still coming through.

1532
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,760
I don't know if they would have done it if I didn't host this here show.

1533
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:35,880
But the note I got from them was as an original backer, they wanted to make it right.

1534
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:42,720
And the timing had nothing to do with the phone kickstarting, because the phone fundraiser

1535
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,280
actually got moved up a few weeks, and this has been in manufacturing for much longer

1536
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,280
than a couple of weeks.

1537
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:50,200
Well, I got to say, I'll be very curious to see what you think of it, especially after

1538
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,200
you load Gen 2.

1539
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,560
I just said I think it's 1710.

1540
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,560
Sorry, Chris.

1541
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,520
Did I hear crux?

1542
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,400
I really am feeling like beta 1 is going to be when I jump in on 1710 and start living

1543
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,400
the 1710 lifestyle.

1544
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:05,400
And I think beta 1 is perhaps nigh.

1545
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,400
The future is nigh.

1546
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,960
I wouldn't have expected FreeBSD.

1547
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:08,960
Wow, dude.

1548
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:09,960
That's not what I said at all.

1549
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:10,960
That's not what I said at all.

1550
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,280
Do you want to hand it over to Beardsley to have him take a look at it?

1551
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,280
See what he thinks of it.

1552
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,800
See what the beard thinks of the first impressions.

1553
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,120
I'd like to hear your thoughts on that trackpad, too, Rekai.

1554
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,680
Feels really heavy, that's for sure.

1555
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,640
But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

1556
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:30,640
So yeah, so this is the Librem 15, and this is part of the second batch they've done of

1557
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:31,640
these later models.

1558
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,320
It has a Core i7 Skylake in it.

1559
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:39,680
I think at 3.1 gigahertz with 16 gigs of RAM, DDR4 RAM at that.

1560
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:46,280
It has a, I think, 1080p screen, and you can do M.2 in it, or an MVME drive.

1561
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,080
I think this one has an M.2.

1562
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,080
Yeah.

1563
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:52,280
And it's got, instead of the Windows key, it's got the Purism button.

1564
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,400
It's got a Theros wireless in it.

1565
01:18:54,400 --> 01:19:00,060
It's got a hardware kill switch for the radios, the microphone, and the camera.

1566
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:02,880
I'm not a big fan of the trackpad.

1567
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,960
No?

1568
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:09,600
It feels like I'm not just sliding my hand across it, I have to drag really hard.

1569
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,600
It doesn't feel very smooth.

1570
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,600
It is a little more frictionless than I would want.

1571
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,600
Is it grabby?

1572
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,600
Yeah, grabby's a good term for it.

1573
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,200
The keyboard, though, I really like.

1574
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,520
So this is, does it say on the back there, does it say version three?

1575
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,520
Is that what it is?

1576
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,880
Is that version three of the Librem 15?

1577
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:23,880
Yep.

1578
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:24,880
Version three.

1579
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:25,880
Version three of the Librem 15.

1580
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:26,880
There you go.

1581
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,840
I'll let you guys know what I think about it after I've spent some time with it.

1582
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,440
It seems like a nice piece of hardware, though.

1583
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,240
The build quality actually seems really good.

1584
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,240
And it looks nice.

1585
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:39,560
I would not be ashamed whatsoever to have this in a coffee shop, especially with a few

1586
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,920
Linux stickers on there.

1587
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:44,760
I wonder if, I rubbed my grubby hands on it for a while, if my hand oils will smooth up

1588
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:45,760
that trackpad.

1589
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,520
Do the hardware kill switches look better than the first revision?

1590
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,520
Yeah, way better.

1591
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:53,840
Because in the first revision, they were just holes in the side of the laptop with black

1592
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,240
toggle switches.

1593
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,680
And now you don't even notice them, do you, at first?

1594
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:01,360
Now they're, I wonder if I could, can I pull up a picture?

1595
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:07,400
It feels to me a lot like a very black MacBook.

1596
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,360
Now the kill switches are underneath the monitor somewhere.

1597
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:13,960
It's hard to explain where they're at, but they're above the F keys, below the monitor.

1598
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:19,360
There's like a little bit of flex by the hinge on the bottom, but otherwise it's very sturdy.

1599
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,360
So there you go.

1600
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,460
The new Librem 15 in-house.

1601
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:23,600
How about that?

1602
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,680
August 31st, says Wimpy.

1603
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,000
So that is, the rumors are true, Wimpy.

1604
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,920
Where'd he go?

1605
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:31,920
There you are, Wimpy.

1606
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:32,920
Sorry.

1607
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:33,920
That was my bad.

1608
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:34,920
Say again.

1609
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:35,920
Yes, they are.

1610
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:42,320
It's August the 31st is the release date for beta, 17.10 beta 1 for the participating flavors.

1611
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:47,040
And I'm doing the corralling of the various flavors to do the release management for that

1612
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,640
this time round.

1613
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:53,220
And if you go and grab a daily image for any of your favorite flavors today, is a good

1614
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:57,360
chance that that's probably what will get shipped on Thursday.

1615
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:01,880
So at this point is mostly what we're seeing, what we're going to get, like the look of

1616
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,840
it and the major software and all that.

1617
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,840
Like pretty much now we're there.

1618
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:07,840
Yeah.

1619
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,360
So obviously proper Ubuntu doesn't participate in beta 1.

1620
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:14,960
You'll see that for the first time in beta 2 a month from now.

1621
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:15,960
Okay.

1622
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:20,680
But all of the flavors are participating in beta 1, which is out Thursday.

1623
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,680
Right.

1624
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,680
Okay.

1625
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,680
So including-

1626
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:24,680
And the images get made-

1627
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,680
Including that abuji mate that I've heard of before, I would assume.

1628
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:27,680
Yes.

1629
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,160
That's looking very tasty for this release.

1630
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,880
Maybe I should put that on the early room.

1631
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:32,880
Yeah.

1632
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:33,880
I think you should.

1633
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:34,880
Yeah.

1634
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:35,880
You totally should.

1635
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:36,880
I'll turn on Compass.

1636
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,840
I'll get my mutiny set up going.

1637
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:42,080
That's exactly right.

1638
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,560
I do like Kaja.

1639
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,160
And I do like that software boutique.

1640
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,160
So you do get in there.

1641
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,920
And now that there's the super key, I mean, what's not to love?

1642
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,180
That is true.

1643
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:50,180
That is very true.

1644
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:51,180
You probably live in there for quite some time.

1645
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:54,440
And the hud all up in your face and everything.

1646
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,320
Which is now locally integrated, by the way.

1647
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,320
Oh, really?

1648
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:58,320
Yeah.

1649
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,320
Nice.

1650
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,320
Wow.

1651
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,320
Wow.

1652
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,320
This thing is...

1653
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,200
This 1710 release, not just for Ubuntu proper, but for some of these flavors, too, is really

1654
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,200
something.

1655
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,200
What the hell happened?

1656
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,200
Yeah.

1657
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,740
I think everyone's working really hard on their 1710 releases.

1658
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:17,000
It seems like in the last couple releases, enough things have been changed or stabilized

1659
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,980
in the below parts of the distro that there's really time now or effort that can be spent

1660
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:24,760
on making all these things we've all been excited for.

1661
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:28,080
It's good timing for me since I'm distro hopping right now.

1662
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,080
So the machine...

1663
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,880
You know, what's great is I don't really have a horse in this race.

1664
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:34,120
So the machine that I'm recording this show on is running Arch.

1665
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:37,980
The machine I'm sitting in front of, like showing webpages and stuff, is running Solus.

1666
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:41,240
And the machine the mumble room is on is on Ubuntu LTS.

1667
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,980
So I'm pretty much like I'm sitting pretty and whichever way this thing goes, I'm pretty

1668
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:45,980
much happy.

1669
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:49,480
I'm just sitting back and enjoying it and just trying out different distros at this

1670
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:50,480
point.

1671
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,480
It's kind of a nice...

1672
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:53,960
Have you heard of the Church of Neon?

1673
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:54,960
You know?

1674
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:55,960
Yeah.

1675
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:56,960
Don't worry, buddy.

1676
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:57,960
I got your back.

1677
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:58,960
You know, it's funny is I do still have...

1678
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:01,560
I still have a system at home running Plasma.

1679
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,720
And it's my one like...

1680
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,740
It's still my one Plasma system.

1681
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:11,480
And I sit down at it and I fired up and like, you know, this is so smooth and so nice.

1682
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,480
I really enjoyed it.

1683
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,480
So, yeah.

1684
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,480
It's still...

1685
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,480
You're just a sucker for Kwin.

1686
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:16,860
It's still a contender.

1687
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:17,860
It's still a contender.

1688
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,860
All right, Wes.

1689
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:19,860
Well, you know what we got to do?

1690
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:21,100
We got to get out of here.

1691
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,360
Enough Linux for today.

1692
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,360
We must go.

1693
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,240
There is TechSnap to be had.

1694
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,360
Mumble Room, thank you very much for being here.

1695
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,840
I really appreciate it, guys.

1696
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,680
I think you just want to play with the purism.

1697
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:31,840
That's true.

1698
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:32,840
That is true.

1699
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:33,840
That is totally true.

1700
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,840
That is totally true.

1701
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:39,200
Thank you to our Discord chat for hanging out with us at Discord.me slash Jupiter Colony.

1702
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,200
Thank you to Beardsley.

1703
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,200
Where should people find you, Beard?

1704
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,200
Rec.net.

1705
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,200
R-E-K-D.net.

1706
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,560
You can, of course, get more of Wes on TechSnap.

1707
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,960
Anywhere else you want to send folks?

1708
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,040
At Wes Payne on Twitter.

1709
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,040
Boom.

1710
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,840
Check out YouTube.com slash Chris Fisher.

1711
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:56,160
I just posted a brand new vlog today where I go inside a very creepy barn.

1712
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,160
Thanks for joining us.

1713
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:23,960
I'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1714
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:41,880
All right.

1715
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:42,880
We did a podcast.

1716
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,960
We did a podcast.

1717
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:44,960
Thank you, Mumble Room.

1718
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:45,960
Thank you, IRC.

1719
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:46,960
Yeah.

1720
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:47,960
That was some good mumbling today.

1721
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:48,960
Thank you, Discord.

1722
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,560
So we got to pick our title.

1723
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:55,040
And I thought maybe should we do something around the Librem, the purism, like the hope

1724
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,160
of the free Linux phone?

1725
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,160
Something like that?

1726
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,160
What do you guys think?

1727
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:01,160
Bueller?

1728
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:02,160
Librem free phone.

1729
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,160
Phone's home.

1730
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:07,640
What about Librem 5, a new hope?

1731
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,360
The new hope thing's played, man.

1732
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,360
It's played.

1733
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,360
It's played.

1734
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:13,360
I don't know.

1735
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,360
Okay.

1736
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,360
How about Librem 5, the Phantom Menace?

1737
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,360
What do you think?

1738
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:17,360
Anybody?

1739
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:20,160
Mumble Room thoughts on titles?

1740
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:23,160
Mobile Linux purity.

1741
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,600
Uh.

1742
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,160
We could just call it Pure Linux.

1743
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:30,920
No.

1744
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:32,760
No.

1745
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:40,200
What about something about the free phone dream?

1746
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,840
Should it just be the free phone dream?

1747
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:44,840
Free phone nightmare continues.

1748
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:45,840
Free phone?

1749
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:50,320
No free phone nightmare.

1750
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,960
The free phone nightmare is not bad either.

1751
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,560
Librem.

1752
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:57,560
The free phone nightmare.

1753
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:00,320
Floss nightly.

1754
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,320
Phoning it in.

1755
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,320
Oh, I think we've maybe done that.

1756
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,280
Yeah, I think that does sound familiar.

1757
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,280
It does.

1758
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,280
We're so punny.

1759
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:11,800
It's not our fault, it's our culture.

1760
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,160
The free phone nightmare is kind of my current leading.

1761
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,400
I like that one.

1762
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:17,160
It's pretty good.

1763
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:18,160
Librem phone's home.

1764
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:23,200
No, it doesn't do that, I swear.

1765
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:52,200
That's deliciously ironic, I like that.
