WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
Are you tired of your Raspberry Pi sounding like this?

00:04.520 --> 00:07.760
Well, the Raspberry Pi Foundation has got some good news for you.

00:07.760 --> 00:13.520
It seems like the thermal performance on the old Pi Fourski is way better these days.

00:13.520 --> 00:18.560
Yeah, they've got a great blog post detailing it with some really neat thermal imaging images

00:18.560 --> 00:22.120
out there, so you can go take a look and see just where the hotspots are.

00:22.120 --> 00:26.020
And how they tested it, and what you could do to test it yourself.

00:26.020 --> 00:29.120
One thing I found humorous though is at the very end, despite all the great improvements

00:29.120 --> 00:33.560
that the recent firmware updates have indeed provided, their best recommendation is still

00:33.560 --> 00:36.360
to just turn the Raspberry Pi 4 on its side.

00:36.360 --> 00:37.360
You're stacking it wrong.

00:37.360 --> 00:48.980
Well, hello friends, and welcome in to the Unplugged program.

00:48.980 --> 00:51.220
This is episode 330.

00:51.220 --> 00:52.220
My name is Chris.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.220
My name is Wes.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.220
Almost forgot the number.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.220
There's too many.

00:55.220 --> 00:56.220
Too many to count.

00:56.220 --> 00:57.220
It's a lot of numbers, Wes.

00:57.220 --> 00:58.220
Hello to Cheese and Alex too, hey gentlemen.

00:58.220 --> 00:59.220
Hello, hello.

00:59.220 --> 01:00.220
Hello.

01:00.220 --> 01:01.220
Well, hello.

01:01.220 --> 01:02.220
We have a really fun show.

01:02.220 --> 01:07.040
I'm excited to be joined by not just you, but also our virtual lug, time appropriate

01:07.040 --> 01:08.040
greetings Mumble Room.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.040
Hello.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.040
Hello, hello.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.040
Hello, hello.

01:11.040 --> 01:12.040
Hi there.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.040
Mumble Overload.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.040
That's right.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.540
Happy Linux Tuesday.

01:15.540 --> 01:17.760
Happy Linux Tuesday to you too, Jill.

01:17.760 --> 01:25.760
And Ace Nomad, Byte, Cassidy, Dan, DM, and I'm going to say Jensen Gruck.

01:25.760 --> 01:26.760
Wow.

01:26.760 --> 01:31.200
Okay, so we have a lot coming up in the show today.

01:31.200 --> 01:37.760
We have some community news, but this episode is the one we've been waiting to do all year.

01:37.760 --> 01:41.800
We get to celebrate Linux as an implementation detail with the family.

01:41.800 --> 01:42.800
That's right.

01:42.800 --> 01:47.120
I mean, we already know Linux is everywhere, but it can be a few more places, especially

01:47.120 --> 01:48.120
in your family's home.

01:48.120 --> 01:52.480
Now, if you're like me or Wes or Cheesy or Alex or pretty much anyone in the virtual

01:52.480 --> 01:57.480
world, like you've likely got a small board computer of some type or you've thought about

01:57.480 --> 02:01.200
getting one, well, how cool would it be if you could make some great holiday gifts out

02:01.200 --> 02:02.200
of these suckers?

02:02.200 --> 02:06.540
So we're going to talk about ways to do that, but also just some really good projects.

02:06.540 --> 02:09.880
If you want to set up backup for yourself this year, if you want to build some mini

02:09.880 --> 02:15.300
projects for people yourself or maybe strangers, there's a lot of good ideas in here.

02:15.300 --> 02:19.520
This is basically all the things we love and what we're doing with them for the holidays.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.780
Really some great projects we're going to get to.

02:21.780 --> 02:28.640
Now, Mr. Payne, some really, really good news for the backers of the Librem 5 this week.

02:28.640 --> 02:37.040
It seems that backers have begun receiving their Linux phones, some mostly working, but

02:37.040 --> 02:39.080
exciting nonetheless to see this.

02:39.080 --> 02:43.360
And we all expected when people actually started receiving their devices, it would be all over

02:43.360 --> 02:44.360
the internet.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.360
And it has.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.360
Of course.

02:46.360 --> 02:47.360
I mean, who wouldn't be excited?

02:47.360 --> 02:48.360
Yeah.

02:48.360 --> 02:49.360
And these are geeks, right?

02:49.360 --> 02:50.360
That are passionate about the mission.

02:50.360 --> 02:53.360
They want to process it and it's here and it's great.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.400
And it mostly works.

02:55.400 --> 02:59.320
For the most part, things are exactly what you would expect, a little rough around the

02:59.320 --> 03:04.080
edges or completely rough around the edges.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.880
Stability issues have been mentioned.

03:05.880 --> 03:10.960
Charging issues doesn't charge when the device is powered up, essentially is a current problem.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.360
And battery only lasts about an hour.

03:13.360 --> 03:18.660
But there is in almost all of these reviews being posted, a thread of what seems to be

03:18.660 --> 03:21.520
genuine potential, like they see the potential here.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.960
These people are not, they're not ripping it up.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.120
They're just setting expectations, I think.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.120
Right.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.880
I mean, you have to view this as a work in progress and experiment, right?

03:29.880 --> 03:34.000
When you're on the cutting edge of freezing open source hardware.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Yeah.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.200
You can't initiate a call.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.800
You can receive a call, I believe.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.920
But I think there's something working where like they can't hear you, like the audio isn't

03:42.920 --> 03:44.880
routing properly or something to that effect.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.640
And of course, the phone app tends to crash.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.140
It does seem like it's a pretty nice web browser.

03:50.140 --> 03:54.160
And while it is thicker than most phones, so far, the reviewers seem to think that it's

03:54.160 --> 03:55.920
actually quite comfortable to hold.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.320
You can get around the actual Linux underpinnings, too.

03:58.320 --> 04:02.500
So if you know really what you want is a Linux box, I mean, it's there for that.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.980
Pretty neat to see people receiving them.

04:04.980 --> 04:09.480
It's early, early, early, like some of these are not fully functional.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.920
Some of them are very much prototypes.

04:10.920 --> 04:15.120
They seem to vary a lot in quality, more than I think we were led to believe.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.980
But it is nice to see it out there, and kind of along the same lines, while we're talking

04:17.980 --> 04:21.820
about these phones, there's an early look at the PinePhone Developer Edition, which

04:21.820 --> 04:23.320
is the one that I preordered.

04:23.320 --> 04:27.860
Yeah, Lucas, who we've had on the show recently, did a video, which we'll have linked.

04:27.860 --> 04:30.920
It's posted as well over at OMG Ubuntu.

04:30.920 --> 04:37.140
And I mean, you're only getting like a 10-minute look at this thing, so it's pretty hard to

04:37.140 --> 04:41.080
really come away with a firm opinion.

04:41.080 --> 04:45.380
But it feels a lot further along, and I think a big part of that is they're leveraging an

04:45.380 --> 04:46.940
existing software stack.

04:46.940 --> 04:47.940
Yes.

04:47.940 --> 04:48.940
Right.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.140
I mean, from a purism perspective, there's a lot of stuff that needs to get invented,

04:51.140 --> 04:54.860
and a lot of work they've done is things that aren't at that fit and finish layer, at least

04:54.860 --> 04:55.900
not yet.

04:55.900 --> 05:00.900
And something that I only recently come to appreciate, thanks to Cheese's conversations

05:00.900 --> 05:08.320
with Pine, is that they have some genuine experience with smaller systems based around

05:08.320 --> 05:09.320
these components.

05:09.320 --> 05:13.220
And the Popcorn Hour is a shipping commercial product that exists today and has existed

05:13.220 --> 05:14.220
for a very long time.

05:14.220 --> 05:15.220
Right.

05:15.220 --> 05:17.020
And that seems to be a lot of the challenges here, right?

05:17.020 --> 05:21.340
It's a unique space with its own constraints and a lot of difficulty getting the right

05:21.340 --> 05:22.340
components.

05:22.340 --> 05:23.340
Good video, though.

05:23.340 --> 05:25.780
So we'll have that linked in the show notes if you want to see the status of the PinePhone.

05:25.780 --> 05:29.260
For those that are still waiting, which I don't know if I consider myself anymore, but

05:29.260 --> 05:33.340
for those of you that are still waiting for that free Linux phone, it's getting closer.

05:33.340 --> 05:34.340
It's getting closer.

05:34.340 --> 05:37.540
Yeah, really, wherever we're at, it's exciting to see progress.

05:37.540 --> 05:40.020
And for all the folks that are interested in it, we're getting closer.

05:40.020 --> 05:42.380
What'll be the threshold for you?

05:42.380 --> 05:44.340
So you've got a Pixel 3, right?

05:44.340 --> 05:46.380
Yeah, Pixel 3.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.380
Pretty nice phone.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.380
Yes.

05:48.380 --> 05:49.380
Pretty good camera.

05:49.380 --> 05:53.020
I'm honestly using my phone more and more as an appliance, so I think that angle is

05:53.020 --> 05:54.260
a little easier to replace.

05:54.260 --> 05:56.700
I need a few apps, mostly for work.

05:56.700 --> 06:00.940
The camera's the kicker for me, though, because I just love having a decent camera in my pocket

06:00.940 --> 06:01.940
all day long.

06:01.940 --> 06:03.820
Yeah, the camera's really good, too, on the Pixel line.

06:03.820 --> 06:08.420
I wouldn't mind having a little full Linux device in my pocket, though, maybe not for

06:08.420 --> 06:12.060
using as a traditional phone, but just for sitting on the couch or carrying with me as

06:12.060 --> 06:13.500
a mobile workstation.

06:13.500 --> 06:17.420
Would it be more appealing if it was a foldable device with an actual physical QWERTY keyboard?

06:17.420 --> 06:18.420
Yeah, probably.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.420
I know.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.420
Isn't that funny?

06:20.420 --> 06:21.420
We've already built these.

06:21.420 --> 06:26.820
You know that they're actually working on a keyboard for the PinePhone 2.

06:26.820 --> 06:27.820
Oh, buddy.

06:27.820 --> 06:28.820
Oh, buddy.

06:28.820 --> 06:29.820
See, that's what I'm talking about.

06:29.820 --> 06:30.820
They get me.

06:30.820 --> 06:31.820
They get me.

06:31.820 --> 06:32.820
All right.

06:32.820 --> 06:35.420
Well, thanks if you guys want to read more about that, but we have some big news to talk

06:35.420 --> 06:36.420
about.

06:36.420 --> 06:43.020
A brand shiny, fancy, fantastic release of elementary OS.

06:43.020 --> 06:47.900
Elementary OS 5.1, Cassidy and Dan, congratulations on the new release, gentlemen.

06:47.900 --> 06:48.900
Thank you.

06:48.900 --> 06:49.900
Thank you.

06:49.900 --> 06:56.600
I have been kicking the tires on this one for the weekend, and I am so impressed with

06:56.600 --> 07:00.600
what you guys have accomplished with this release.

07:00.600 --> 07:07.700
You are truly crossing that uncanny valley that we have struggled to really fully cross

07:07.700 --> 07:10.420
for so long with desktop Linux.

07:10.420 --> 07:15.460
And now in some areas, I think you guys are exceeding the quality of experience that you

07:15.460 --> 07:19.640
get on commercial platforms in multiple categories now.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.300
So that's like a huge achievement on its own.

07:23.300 --> 07:27.420
And there is so much in this release that I guess I'll start with you, Dan.

07:27.420 --> 07:29.220
Why is this a.1 release?

07:29.220 --> 07:34.060
This seems like this should be like 5.5, 5.8, maybe even 6.

07:34.060 --> 07:37.980
Like there is new login screens.

07:37.980 --> 07:40.240
There's a new greeter that's the best greeter.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.220
The new onboarding app is the best onboarding app on any desktop.

07:43.220 --> 07:44.220
Incredible.

07:44.220 --> 07:45.220
It's so good.

07:45.220 --> 07:46.220
It's nice, clean.

07:46.220 --> 07:48.700
The only thing I would add is maybe like a little boutique style couple of apps.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.020
But other than that, it's so perfect.

07:50.020 --> 07:52.100
The Flatpak integration, you nailed it.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.100
It's great.

07:53.100 --> 07:56.060
I love the dialogues I get when I'm installing Flatpaks.

07:56.060 --> 07:58.220
So why is this not just a whole new version?

07:58.220 --> 07:59.700
So Dan's internet is actually dropping out.

07:59.700 --> 08:01.180
So it's just me right now.

08:01.180 --> 08:04.300
Cassidy, answer why is this just not a whole new version?

08:04.300 --> 08:10.080
So the big thing is that it's still based on the same solid core of Juno, which means

08:10.080 --> 08:17.360
it's Ubuntu 18.04 LTS based with the Ubuntu 18.04 repositories under the hood.

08:17.360 --> 08:22.540
So it didn't feel right to say that it's a whole new like 6.0 version.

08:22.540 --> 08:26.220
But at the same time, we wanted to like give it a new name and point release because there

08:26.220 --> 08:29.460
is just so much new stuff in this release.

08:29.460 --> 08:34.140
There's also, if I'm understanding correctly, all of the hardware enablement stuff from

08:34.140 --> 08:36.700
the underlying 18.04 updates that have come along.

08:36.700 --> 08:37.700
Exactly.

08:37.700 --> 08:43.540
So it's basically the same core as Ubuntu 18.04.3 with Linux 5.

08:43.540 --> 08:49.060
Whatever the latest is and all the hardware enablement stuff that comes along with that.

08:49.060 --> 08:51.580
That's thanks to Canonical for all that awesome work.

08:51.580 --> 08:56.420
And that's why we enjoy building off the LTS because we get this really solid foundational

08:56.420 --> 09:00.620
platform, but we can have a more rolling release style on top of it.

09:00.620 --> 09:01.620
Right.

09:01.620 --> 09:03.020
You know, things aren't going to change out from under you.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.020
Exactly.

09:04.020 --> 09:10.140
This is starting to address what my experience as somebody who's just a Linux desktop enthusiast

09:10.140 --> 09:14.580
and just enjoys all the different new things that are constantly being developed.

09:14.580 --> 09:18.980
My experience with elementary in the past had been it's sort of a tease.

09:18.980 --> 09:23.940
Like I see all these other great things like do not disturb mode and night color shifting

09:23.940 --> 09:24.940
coming to other desktops.

09:24.940 --> 09:27.460
And I think, oh, man, I really would love to have this on elementary.

09:27.460 --> 09:30.100
In the past, I would have waited quite a bit longer.

09:30.100 --> 09:33.900
But now these things are coming at a much faster clip.

09:33.900 --> 09:39.340
And when they do land, they're like the best implementation period.

09:39.340 --> 09:41.580
The recent, do you call it night light?

09:41.580 --> 09:44.660
The recent tone shifting that people can turn on for nighttime color?

09:44.660 --> 09:45.660
Yeah.

09:45.660 --> 09:46.660
Night light.

09:46.660 --> 09:47.660
Yeah.

09:47.660 --> 09:52.300
So it's just a great implementation where once you turn it on, there's a little icon

09:52.300 --> 09:56.460
up in the beautiful toolbar that I don't know what you call that, the pantheon, that top

09:56.460 --> 09:57.460
bar.

09:57.460 --> 09:58.460
Top panel.

09:58.460 --> 09:59.460
Top panel.

09:59.460 --> 10:00.460
It's gorgeous.

10:00.460 --> 10:01.460
Up there, a little sun icon shows up.

10:01.460 --> 10:02.620
And you can click that.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.540
And you can snooze it with one button.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.100
There's a couple of quick options.

10:06.100 --> 10:07.740
It's so slick.

10:07.740 --> 10:13.540
It's so well done that when these features do land, they seem to be one of the best implementations

10:13.540 --> 10:14.540
of them.

10:14.540 --> 10:15.540
Right.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.580
It's like a microcosm maybe of the whole philosophy of elementary.

10:17.580 --> 10:21.900
So what has been the enabler that's meant that, I feel like this is maybe the third

10:21.900 --> 10:25.340
time we've had a version of this conversation with this release, like they're landing faster

10:25.340 --> 10:27.780
and they're landing in the current releases.

10:27.780 --> 10:28.900
What's been the big shift that's happened?

10:28.900 --> 10:30.020
Is it a philosophical thing?

10:30.020 --> 10:31.420
Is it a resources thing?

10:31.420 --> 10:34.220
I think it's partially philosophical.

10:34.220 --> 10:38.540
We've kind of always had this mentality, but I think we've really kind of hit our stride

10:38.540 --> 10:43.620
with it now where we don't hold back features from the current release.

10:43.620 --> 10:48.820
As much and often as we can, we push out updates to the current release.

10:48.820 --> 10:51.420
It adds features, improves features.

10:51.420 --> 10:55.920
Maybe even redesigns entire apps or parts of the settings because it gives our users

10:55.920 --> 10:57.000
a better experience.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.260
So it's more of that rolling release mentality.

11:00.260 --> 11:04.960
And we've had that for the last few releases, but what's enabled it for us now is that we

11:04.960 --> 11:10.040
have so much automation going into our release process that it means somebody can report

11:10.040 --> 11:14.900
a bug or somebody can design a new feature and then the next day that can be hitting

11:14.900 --> 11:15.900
users.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.460
So it's so fast now and it's really, really great.

11:18.460 --> 11:19.460
Wow.

11:19.460 --> 11:23.220
And that has come online between the previous release and this release?

11:23.220 --> 11:24.220
Yeah.

11:24.220 --> 11:28.260
So that's been a lot of our work over the last month or two probably for kind of preparing

11:28.260 --> 11:30.620
for this 5.1 release to help enable that.

11:30.620 --> 11:35.780
And so it's automating the app releases and automating the ISO building and that all kind

11:35.780 --> 11:39.060
of came together for 5.1.

11:39.060 --> 11:41.580
It's got to feel like almost a new superpower.

11:41.580 --> 11:42.580
You've been upgraded.

11:42.580 --> 11:43.580
Yeah.

11:43.580 --> 11:44.580
It's so awesome.

11:44.580 --> 11:48.180
It's really just in the last couple of weeks we've been seeing like literally somebody

11:48.180 --> 11:53.040
will report a bug and then it gets approved and merged and fixed and out the next day

11:53.040 --> 11:55.100
and it's like, oh, that feels so good.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.360
That's where software should be.

11:56.360 --> 11:59.280
It's more continuous instead of waiting.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.660
In some cases, in some operating systems, you'd be waiting months for that update.

12:02.660 --> 12:03.660
Sure.

12:03.660 --> 12:04.660
Yeah.

12:04.660 --> 12:08.140
I think too, the overall experience I get is I use that uncanny valley analogy.

12:08.140 --> 12:14.340
It's like there's so many little areas that have been smoothed out that make it a more

12:14.340 --> 12:17.780
comprehensive product.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.500
I really, really like Pantheon.

12:20.500 --> 12:26.220
It is at first, not everything is super obvious, but it is pretty easy to discover.

12:26.220 --> 12:31.300
Like if you hit the super key, a menu comes up and it's very clear on what you can do.

12:31.300 --> 12:35.080
And within minutes I was, oh, so this is how I do multiple desktops.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.960
This is how I move stuff around and it's slick, it's smooth.

12:37.960 --> 12:43.460
Why is Pantheon so much smoother than some other projects that are based around similar

12:43.460 --> 12:44.580
technologies?

12:44.580 --> 12:45.580
What is it in there?

12:45.580 --> 12:47.080
Is it the way you guys are hitting the GPU?

12:47.080 --> 12:49.780
Is it magic?

12:49.780 --> 12:55.980
I mean, maybe a little bit of magic, but no, I think we've been working at like a decade

12:55.980 --> 13:03.100
now on UX focused development and all of our features are UX first.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.200
We don't think about, oh, here's a new technology.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.460
Now let's find a way to implement it in the UI.

13:07.460 --> 13:11.800
We think what do we actually want the UI to do and how do we want it to feel and work

13:11.800 --> 13:12.800
for the user?

13:12.800 --> 13:15.940
And then we build the technology to support that.

13:15.940 --> 13:18.340
So I think that's a big part of it.

13:18.340 --> 13:22.660
I mean, honestly, another big part is that we are building off of really solid technologies.

13:22.660 --> 13:27.000
A lot of stuff that's enabled from the gnome upstream projects.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.400
So we're not using gnome shell, but we're using Mudder, which is the window manager.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.500
So improvements there trickle down into elementary OS.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.820
So we have these really solid technologies and can kind of mold them and shape them how

13:36.820 --> 13:38.780
we want to create our own experience.

13:38.780 --> 13:39.780
I see.

13:39.780 --> 13:40.780
So that's great.

13:40.780 --> 13:44.700
I didn't quite appreciate that upstream Mudder improvements benefited the Pantheon desktop

13:44.700 --> 13:48.300
and that kind of maybe explained some of the performance improvements that I'm noticing.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.300
Okay.

13:49.300 --> 13:53.340
So now I have a couple of questions for you that are more like, why aren't you doing this

13:53.340 --> 13:54.340
questions?

13:54.340 --> 14:01.140
You're sort of one of the leading voices of a desktop standard, like a free desktop standard

14:01.140 --> 14:02.140
dark mode.

14:02.140 --> 14:07.420
I note though that dark mode is notably absent from elementary 5.1.

14:07.420 --> 14:09.500
Yes, it's not perfect yet.

14:09.500 --> 14:13.540
So we're doing a lot of work under the hood and behind the scenes and working with other

14:13.540 --> 14:16.100
projects to help standardize this.

14:16.100 --> 14:22.340
But it actually hasn't been standardized yet in GTK or a free desktop spec yet.

14:22.340 --> 14:28.200
So while we could just throw in like a hammer to smash dark mode onto your desktop, it still

14:28.200 --> 14:31.360
can cause breakage in certain areas.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.620
So we don't feel comfortable enabling that because it's not as good of an experience

14:34.620 --> 14:38.180
as it can be, but we are definitely working in that direction.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.180
That makes sense.

14:39.180 --> 14:41.580
I mean, it kind of hits on what you're talking about earlier, right?

14:41.580 --> 14:45.700
Other distributions might not make that choice, but that's the way you guys are doing things.

14:45.700 --> 14:46.700
Yeah.

14:46.700 --> 14:49.340
It's part of the philosophical difference I think of elementary OS compared to other

14:49.340 --> 14:55.580
projects is we really, really, really, and not to say other desktops don't care about

14:55.580 --> 15:00.660
the UX, but we were kind of fanatical about it.

15:00.660 --> 15:07.060
And so we'll be willing to not ship a feature early so that we can get it right and then

15:07.060 --> 15:09.060
ship it to users when it feels really good.

15:09.060 --> 15:10.060
Yeah.

15:10.060 --> 15:12.900
I mean, and at this point where we're sitting, I mean, that's clearly working.

15:12.900 --> 15:16.420
You can't argue with like early on as I don't know, guys, who are you to decide?

15:16.420 --> 15:18.300
But now I'm like, oh yeah, they've got this figured out.

15:18.300 --> 15:19.300
Okay.

15:19.300 --> 15:22.620
So the second question is, and this kind of plays off what you were saying earlier about

15:22.620 --> 15:26.420
how you don't just go and build something once the underlying tech is there.

15:26.420 --> 15:31.700
I was surprised I installed one of the flat packs I decided to sideload just to experiment

15:31.700 --> 15:39.120
with this flat pack and support was Nome firmware, which installs, but then complains excessively

15:39.120 --> 15:44.180
that there's no LVFS support on the system, but that doesn't come from Ubuntu automatically.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.780
Is there plans down the road to integrate that into app center?

15:46.780 --> 15:51.460
Have you guys looked at LVFS firmware updates for like laptops and whatnot?

15:51.460 --> 15:52.460
Yeah.

15:52.460 --> 15:54.100
So that's a feature that we've looked at.

15:54.100 --> 15:58.100
I've prototyped some stuff actually related to that.

15:58.100 --> 16:03.780
I think we plan to support FWEPT, you know, the firmware update Daemon and LVFS.

16:03.780 --> 16:06.940
It's just, we haven't built that out quite yet.

16:06.940 --> 16:10.720
There's still, I think, an open question too of do firmware updates belong in your app

16:10.720 --> 16:13.080
store or in your system settings?

16:13.080 --> 16:17.580
And so we kind of have to figure out what we want that experience to actually feel like

16:17.580 --> 16:19.940
and look like before we start building it.

16:19.940 --> 16:20.940
Yeah, that makes sense.

16:20.940 --> 16:21.940
Yeah.

16:21.940 --> 16:27.060
So the firmware is good, but I don't know if the display and the way it gives out information

16:27.060 --> 16:28.460
is really up to standard.

16:28.460 --> 16:29.460
Yeah.

16:29.460 --> 16:33.700
And it feels pretty Nomi, which Nome and elementary, we share a lot of technologies, but we have

16:33.700 --> 16:36.300
different human interface guidelines and styles.

16:36.300 --> 16:40.220
So it feels a little weird to shove a Nome thing into elementary or an elementary thing

16:40.220 --> 16:41.500
into Nome.

16:41.500 --> 16:45.740
So I think, I mean, right today you can do it from the command line.

16:45.740 --> 16:48.060
You can install FWEPT and use it from the command line.

16:48.060 --> 16:49.820
Obviously that's not the best experience.

16:49.820 --> 16:52.740
So we're looking at how we want to integrate it into the desktop itself.

16:52.740 --> 16:53.740
But there's a means.

16:53.740 --> 16:57.140
Should somebody need to, you know, update a thing bad or something like that that they've

16:57.140 --> 16:58.140
recently got?

16:58.140 --> 16:59.140
Yeah.

16:59.140 --> 17:02.780
I've got a Dell precision and I've run my updates from that and a eight bit dough controller

17:02.780 --> 17:05.040
and gotten updates for that, my watch tech keyboard and stuff.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.980
So it's, it's definitely there and working.

17:06.980 --> 17:09.340
We just got to integrate it into the UI.

17:09.340 --> 17:12.900
There's just a one other thing I thought we should touch on because you guys do such a

17:12.900 --> 17:13.900
great job at it.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.800
But I, I didn't really know when this started happening, but I definitely noticed it because

17:17.800 --> 17:23.420
of the new onboarding process that in the background, elementary OS is doing a bit of

17:23.420 --> 17:26.260
housekeeping and keeping temp files clean and logs.

17:26.260 --> 17:28.900
Like it's, is that, is that a newish feature?

17:28.900 --> 17:29.900
Cause that seems pretty cool.

17:29.900 --> 17:30.900
Yeah.

17:30.900 --> 17:35.580
I think that launched with Juno with 5.0, but a lot of people didn't know about it.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.700
And that's, that's a big reason.

17:37.700 --> 17:38.900
Onboarding is really nice.

17:38.900 --> 17:44.100
We've had people tweeting at us like in the past couple of weeks leading up to 5.1 about

17:44.100 --> 17:46.460
things are like, Oh, I got this new 5.1 feature.

17:46.460 --> 17:50.580
It's like, well, it's actually been in elementary OS for a while, but now that you have onboarding,

17:50.580 --> 17:56.020
you can say, Oh, a nightlight's a cool feature that I didn't know about or, you know, housekeeping

17:56.020 --> 17:57.340
to clean up that stuff.

17:57.340 --> 18:02.240
So I think that's been there since 5.0 and it's enabled by the gnome settings daemon,

18:02.240 --> 18:05.900
but it's just, we've found a way to better expose it to users.

18:05.900 --> 18:08.040
It makes all the difference.

18:08.040 --> 18:11.640
And that's, what's so good about that new onboarding thing is you get, you expose really

18:11.640 --> 18:15.340
good features in a totally non-obnoxious way.

18:15.340 --> 18:16.660
So I really appreciate that.

18:16.660 --> 18:19.620
But the one last thing I wanted to touch on is because I think you guys are doing kind

18:19.620 --> 18:25.880
of a special job at this is constant iteration and improvements on accessibility features.

18:25.880 --> 18:31.140
It's not something I personally follow, but I know that it matters a lot to certain people.

18:31.140 --> 18:33.980
And I know there's been some improvements in 5.1 in that regard.

18:33.980 --> 18:34.980
Yeah.

18:34.980 --> 18:40.640
So actually I recently gave a talk at the Linux app summit about this.

18:40.640 --> 18:45.740
Our philosophy, we kind of shifted our philosophy in the last year or two that accessibility

18:45.740 --> 18:52.740
features are just features rather than kind of putting these features away in a little

18:52.740 --> 18:57.840
closet called universal access where only people who, you know, have severe physical

18:57.840 --> 19:00.660
disabilities find them.

19:00.660 --> 19:06.940
We've decided that it's better and it's, features get better tested and more well supported

19:06.940 --> 19:11.140
if we actually just support them as a standard feature of the operating system and more people

19:11.140 --> 19:16.540
who might not think they need an accessibility feature actually end up using and benefiting

19:16.540 --> 19:17.540
from these.

19:17.540 --> 19:19.420
So that's been the focus.

19:19.420 --> 19:21.960
A lot of that has been in system settings.

19:21.960 --> 19:26.500
So things like text scaling, instead of being under an accessibility setting, it's just

19:26.500 --> 19:27.860
in the desktop settings now.

19:27.860 --> 19:28.860
Yeah.

19:28.860 --> 19:31.740
I think that's a brilliant outlook on it because I'm one of those people, right?

19:31.740 --> 19:34.060
And it fits with the sort of Linux world, right?

19:34.060 --> 19:36.360
We want to be able to tinker with and modify these things.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.260
I really liked the text size one specifically.

19:38.260 --> 19:41.220
That was the one I played with on this latest install just to see how do I feel about it

19:41.220 --> 19:45.940
because I'm on a 2K display and having slightly larger text size was nice.

19:45.940 --> 19:46.940
You know me, Wes.

19:46.940 --> 19:47.940
I love the 2K resolution.

19:47.940 --> 19:48.940
You love those 2K.

19:48.940 --> 19:52.100
So I really thought that was a great idea and I think that's a perfect outlook to have

19:52.100 --> 19:53.100
on it.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.100
Yeah.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.100
And the analogy I like to use is curb cuts.

19:55.100 --> 20:00.060
It's like where a sidewalk meets a road and you have the curb that is like a little ramp

20:00.060 --> 20:01.060
up to the sidewalk.

20:01.060 --> 20:02.060
Uh-huh.

20:02.060 --> 20:06.160
Those were designed for wheelchair users originally, but like those are, those are useful features

20:06.160 --> 20:08.940
for anybody to take advantage of.

20:08.940 --> 20:13.840
So we like to, we have this effort we call curb cuts around elementary OS of things that

20:13.840 --> 20:18.140
help access accessibility, but actually can be useful to everybody.

20:18.140 --> 20:19.880
And I think it's starting to show.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.140
That's a good insight into the project.

20:22.140 --> 20:25.300
And you know, I use those curb cuts when I'm rolling around in my blades.

20:25.300 --> 20:26.300
Cheese, I know.

20:26.300 --> 20:27.300
Exactly.

20:27.300 --> 20:28.300
You had something too you wanted to touch on.

20:28.300 --> 20:29.300
Yeah.

20:29.300 --> 20:31.940
So I have a question for you, Cassidy.

20:31.940 --> 20:36.100
First of all, I, you know, I've been running the latest 5.1 here for, I don't know, a couple

20:36.100 --> 20:38.940
of hours and just tinkering with it.

20:38.940 --> 20:43.220
One thing that you guys do that's really different from anyone else with the App Center is that

20:43.220 --> 20:48.220
you give people the opportunity to donate to these projects, to their favorite pieces

20:48.220 --> 20:49.600
of software.

20:49.600 --> 20:57.140
But one thing that I've noticed is across installs, there's no real say elementary account

20:57.140 --> 21:01.540
based system like maybe you would have with Mac OS or something like that where you can

21:01.540 --> 21:02.540
continue to log in.

21:02.540 --> 21:09.860
And so if I reload my laptop, I can log back in and all the software that I've previously

21:09.860 --> 21:13.180
purchased is available for me to download again.

21:13.180 --> 21:18.460
Are there any plans to maybe put some sort of feature into the App Center like that so

21:18.460 --> 21:23.940
that users who have purchased software can log back into the App Center and redownload

21:23.940 --> 21:25.780
the software that they've already purchased?

21:25.780 --> 21:26.780
Yeah, definitely.

21:26.780 --> 21:31.980
Today, there's actually a way to do it from the terminal to like export your purchases

21:31.980 --> 21:33.380
and then re-import them.

21:33.380 --> 21:35.460
And it's kind of hidden, not super easy.

21:35.460 --> 21:40.140
So we don't expose that for everybody to do because it's not the greatest experience,

21:40.140 --> 21:41.140
but it's possible.

21:41.140 --> 21:50.620
Kind of the hold up there today is we're very, very fanatic about not having a server where

21:50.620 --> 21:54.220
we have user accounts and store user information.

21:54.220 --> 21:58.740
But we do have a way we can do that in the future using actually our payment processor

21:58.740 --> 22:03.220
Stripe has a customer's feature where we're not actually like storing any data about users

22:03.220 --> 22:08.180
on our infrastructure, but we could have a restore purchases option.

22:08.180 --> 22:12.240
So that's definitely something we're working on and looking into.

22:12.240 --> 22:17.280
And alongside that, actually, we're working with the folks at Flatpak and FlatHub to enable

22:17.280 --> 22:21.020
payments for Flatpaks themselves.

22:21.020 --> 22:23.840
So Alexander Larson is doing some awesome work there.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.420
There's a new release of Flatpak coming out soon that should support that.

22:27.420 --> 22:34.740
And a lot of our work will be focused on enabling payments and payment restoration with Flatpaks.

22:34.740 --> 22:38.300
Yeah, I'm looking forward to see where they go with that.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.080
That is coming soon to Flatpaks.

22:40.080 --> 22:45.700
And I think that's going to make a huge difference over at FlatHub, even if it's just for donations

22:45.700 --> 22:47.660
initially, to just say thank you for making this.

22:47.660 --> 22:48.660
Right, having it built right in.

22:48.660 --> 22:49.660
Yeah.

22:49.660 --> 22:51.300
Well, Cassidy, thank you for coming.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.340
Sorry, Dan, that your internet connection was cutting out.

22:54.340 --> 22:58.060
But Cassidy, you covered it great and really enjoying the new release.

22:58.060 --> 23:02.020
I encourage everyone, check the link out in the show notes, read the release notes, because

23:02.020 --> 23:03.020
they're the best.

23:03.020 --> 23:06.760
And then grab an ISO, because it's the best.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.300
Just such a solid release every time.

23:08.300 --> 23:11.180
I can't remember the last time we've been like, boy, that new elementary OS sure is

23:11.180 --> 23:12.180
crap.

23:12.180 --> 23:13.740
I really blew it this time, didn't I?

23:13.740 --> 23:15.220
You guys nail it every single time.

23:15.220 --> 23:16.220
Every single time.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.660
So the wait is worth it.

23:17.660 --> 23:19.100
I say congratulations.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.420
Thank you.

23:20.420 --> 23:22.160
Go get 5.1.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.160
It's killer.

23:23.160 --> 23:27.420
With that said, it's time for a little housekeeping.

23:27.420 --> 23:31.140
First and foremost, gonna mention right here at the top of the housekeeping, Linux headlines

23:31.140 --> 23:37.660
are daily, every weekday, Linux podcast in three minutes or less, everything is happening

23:37.660 --> 23:40.220
in Linux and open source.

23:40.220 --> 23:43.720
And this thing is packed full of information.

23:43.720 --> 23:48.540
We've got a dedicated research person on there, plus our editors review the content, plus

23:48.540 --> 23:53.320
often multiple hosts review every single episode before it gets published.

23:53.320 --> 23:56.420
We're doing like our real best on this thing.

23:56.420 --> 23:58.340
Every single episode is a team effort.

23:58.340 --> 24:00.180
It's damn impressive.

24:00.180 --> 24:05.660
And you can grab it at linuxheadlines.show slash subscribe.

24:05.660 --> 24:08.260
While we're recording this here episode, another one's about to get posted.

24:08.260 --> 24:09.260
I love it.

24:09.260 --> 24:10.580
I mean, it just helps me stay up to date.

24:10.580 --> 24:14.460
And that means less time I have to spend on Linux subreddit or Hacker News or any place

24:14.460 --> 24:15.560
searching for news.

24:15.560 --> 24:20.820
We took our news pipeline collection and just grew it and expanded it.

24:20.820 --> 24:25.380
And it's really meant that everyone on the team is staying very up to date now.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.420
And it's easy to listen to, right?

24:27.420 --> 24:29.980
There's some support on a little smart speaker near you.

24:29.980 --> 24:30.980
Yeah, it's true.

24:30.980 --> 24:34.420
You can get it in your daily briefing if you got one of them echo tubes.

24:34.420 --> 24:39.080
And you can just subscribe at linuxheadlines.show slash subscribe, three minutes or less.

24:39.080 --> 24:42.420
And we aim for your afternoon commute if you're a commuter too.

24:42.420 --> 24:45.260
So you can just pop it on before you listen to anything else and get an update.

24:45.260 --> 24:46.260
That's what I do.

24:46.260 --> 24:47.260
Just pop it on.

24:47.260 --> 24:48.260
I pop it on.

24:48.260 --> 24:49.260
That's what I do, Wes.

24:49.260 --> 24:50.260
I pop it on.

24:50.260 --> 24:52.460
There's something I'm thinking about doing this Friday.

24:52.460 --> 24:57.060
This could be a really bad idea, especially since it's like the holidays and I already

24:57.060 --> 25:01.780
do enough as it is and you all have enough going on as it is and nobody needs one more

25:01.780 --> 25:02.780
thing.

25:02.780 --> 25:08.980
But I thought if you're around this Friday afternoon, as of when this episode's airing,

25:08.980 --> 25:12.740
maybe we do a little get together, some distros and drinks.

25:12.740 --> 25:13.740
Something I'm thinking about doing.

25:13.740 --> 25:14.740
Are you supplying the drinks?

25:14.740 --> 25:15.740
Nope.

25:15.740 --> 25:16.740
Ah.

25:16.740 --> 25:17.740
BYOD on that one.

25:17.740 --> 25:18.740
Got it.

25:18.740 --> 25:21.340
I'll probably be sipping on a Red Bull myself, but maybe a beer ski.

25:21.340 --> 25:24.940
We'll see if, if enough people take me up on this, I might go get some beer ski.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.900
You will be providing some tips though, right?

25:26.900 --> 25:27.900
Yeah.

25:27.900 --> 25:28.900
So here's the deal.

25:28.900 --> 25:30.700
Uh, I don't know if this is something I want to do all the time, but I thought I'd give

25:30.700 --> 25:31.700
it a try.

25:31.700 --> 25:35.100
And so for this week I thought let's do a little live setting up plasma session.

25:35.100 --> 25:37.260
How I configure my plasma desktop.

25:37.260 --> 25:40.700
Now that I've been back on plasma for a few weeks, I got some things to share.

25:40.700 --> 25:43.980
So tweak your plasma set up along with me from basic to brilliant.

25:43.980 --> 25:44.980
I will back him up.

25:44.980 --> 25:47.500
He tweaked my plasma install and I've been loving it.

25:47.500 --> 25:48.500
You just left it.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.500
It's great.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.540
Um, and I'll have the mumble room going.

25:50.540 --> 25:52.780
I'll have the IRC going, the live stream going.

25:52.780 --> 25:57.500
You can just watch along as I go from zero to hero with my plasma set up and maybe take

25:57.500 --> 25:58.660
a few of those suggestions yourself.

25:58.660 --> 26:00.020
I'll do a screen cap of it.

26:00.020 --> 26:02.060
I'll be on mic and walking you through it.

26:02.060 --> 26:07.620
I also thought this would be a good time to try out some meetup alternatives because meetups

26:07.620 --> 26:09.420
going in a bad direction.

26:09.420 --> 26:16.180
Meetup.com has been a go to resource, but they're charging coming and going these days.

26:16.180 --> 26:17.660
So I'm trying out get together.

26:17.660 --> 26:18.660
Dot community.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.900
I'll have a link in the show notes.

26:20.900 --> 26:21.900
Get together.

26:21.900 --> 26:22.900
Dot community.

26:22.900 --> 26:29.280
Distros and drinks with me on Friday at one PM Pacific to three 30 PM Pacific.

26:29.280 --> 26:33.940
So translate that to your local time and then they just go to jblive.tv there.

26:33.940 --> 26:34.940
Find all the links.

26:34.940 --> 26:35.940
Yep.

26:35.940 --> 26:37.800
We'll have the, we'll have all the streams up if you want to do, I don't, this might

26:37.800 --> 26:38.800
be a dumb idea.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.420
I know nobody uses get together dot community, so I'm probably not going to get people to

26:42.420 --> 26:45.820
register so then I won't know if anybody's going to be there and because it's Friday

26:45.820 --> 26:48.820
before the holidays, nobody's going to show up.

26:48.820 --> 26:52.800
But if you do show up and it becomes a thing, I'll probably start doing like distro reviews

26:52.800 --> 26:53.800
from time to time.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.960
Try out different distros on the live stream cause I got the capture all set up.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.420
So link for the get together page.

26:58.420 --> 27:01.960
I know it means like you got to create another account somewhere.

27:01.960 --> 27:02.960
It's easy though.

27:02.960 --> 27:03.960
I've tried it.

27:03.960 --> 27:04.960
Yeah.

27:04.960 --> 27:05.960
They got single sign on too, so that's not so bad.

27:05.960 --> 27:12.620
And go check out Jupiter extras extras dot show brunch with Brent episode 36 of Jupiter

27:12.620 --> 27:13.620
extras.

27:13.620 --> 27:14.620
Wow.

27:14.620 --> 27:15.620
We've done 36 of these things, but this one's a special one.

27:15.620 --> 27:20.620
He sat down with Rocco, big daddy Linux, great little chat brunch with Brent at extras dot

27:20.620 --> 27:25.660
show and you know, rumor has it if you fiddle around with the categories on that their site,

27:25.660 --> 27:28.800
there's a way you can get a feed just for brunch with Brent or some sort of magical

27:28.800 --> 27:29.800
tags.

27:29.800 --> 27:30.800
Confirm that.

27:30.800 --> 27:31.800
How would I know?

27:31.800 --> 27:32.860
I can't confirm that, but check that out.

27:32.860 --> 27:33.860
Extras dot show.

27:33.860 --> 27:40.340
Jupiter extras is, is up on YouTube and Hey look, after our call out, we got 76 subscribers.

27:40.340 --> 27:41.340
Thanks guys.

27:41.340 --> 27:42.340
Yeah.

27:42.340 --> 27:44.860
If you'd like to be notified of new brunches or any other extra, that's probably the easiest

27:44.860 --> 27:45.860
way.

27:45.860 --> 27:46.860
We're gonna need more though.

27:46.860 --> 27:48.820
Cause I think you need a hundred at least to get a name.

27:48.820 --> 27:50.380
We believe in you community.

27:50.380 --> 27:51.380
So I have a link to that.

27:51.380 --> 27:55.320
We need you to go over to our extras YouTube channel and subscribe for us so we can name

27:55.320 --> 27:56.320
our YouTube channel.

27:56.320 --> 27:57.320
It's really a team effort.

27:57.320 --> 28:01.620
It's so dumb the way YouTube works, but we would appreciate it.

28:01.620 --> 28:02.620
We'll have a link to that.

28:02.620 --> 28:06.420
And last but not least, you know what I'm going to mention West cause I can Jupiter

28:06.420 --> 28:10.180
broadcasting.com slash telegram boom.

28:10.180 --> 28:14.020
Our telegram group is going seven days a week, 24 hours.

28:14.020 --> 28:15.020
Amazing.

28:15.020 --> 28:16.820
I try to stop in there several times a day, minimum.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.160
A lot of us are in there.

28:18.160 --> 28:21.960
So if you want to chat with us, get some in front of us or just talk about a show episode,

28:21.960 --> 28:28.020
the community is always roaring at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash telegram and um, big

28:28.020 --> 28:31.820
shout out because I often will bounce things off of people in there to get their take on

28:31.820 --> 28:32.820
it.

28:32.820 --> 28:35.080
Uh, people will give me followup ideas to shows in there.

28:35.080 --> 28:40.020
So just shout out to that room over a thousand strong and just a bunch of awesome individuals

28:40.020 --> 28:42.080
at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash telegram.

28:42.080 --> 28:45.220
We don't mention it enough for how great it is.

28:45.220 --> 28:46.680
So go check that out.

28:46.680 --> 28:47.780
Anything else for the housekeeping there, mr.

28:47.780 --> 28:48.780
Payne?

28:48.780 --> 28:49.780
I think that does it.

28:49.780 --> 28:53.040
Alrighty then.

28:53.040 --> 28:58.660
So giving the gift of Linux this year, it really is true that for most of the world,

28:58.660 --> 29:01.540
Linux is an implementation detail.

29:01.540 --> 29:02.540
We don't like it.

29:02.540 --> 29:03.540
It drives us crazy.

29:03.540 --> 29:04.540
Hey, that Android device.

29:04.540 --> 29:06.100
Hey, that's got Linux on it.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.100
You know, they don't.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.100
They don't care.

29:08.100 --> 29:09.100
I mean, most they give you that.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.100
Oh yeah.

29:10.100 --> 29:11.100
Nice.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.100
Huh?

29:12.100 --> 29:13.100
Oh yeah.

29:13.100 --> 29:14.100
Isn't that the thing on the cloud?

29:14.100 --> 29:15.100
Yeah.

29:15.100 --> 29:16.100
That's what the cloud's made of.

29:16.100 --> 29:18.720
So I thought this time, let's just embrace it and let's give friends and family little

29:18.720 --> 29:20.780
trinkets and gadgets and gifts.

29:20.780 --> 29:21.780
Right.

29:21.780 --> 29:24.700
The gift to ourselves is we get to play with this stuff and then the gift to them is some

29:24.700 --> 29:27.540
sort of working device that they don't have to know runs on it.

29:27.540 --> 29:30.380
This is a little cheesy, but when you're, ha cheese.

29:30.380 --> 29:36.020
But when you're giving gifts to friends and family that you've known for a while or acquaintances,

29:36.020 --> 29:41.340
you know, work people, whatevs, there is something about getting a custom made gift.

29:41.340 --> 29:44.220
I know that sounds sort of cliche, but it is true.

29:44.220 --> 29:48.980
Like if somebody gave you something they made, I like, I did a thing where I gave out, I've

29:48.980 --> 29:49.980
talked about this.

29:49.980 --> 29:53.720
I gave out wifi access points and picture frames one year, the family loved it.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.340
It really was like it was a little kid I put together.

29:56.340 --> 29:57.340
Everything was all set up.

29:57.340 --> 30:01.860
The access ID, the WPA password, the photo frame was all good to go.

30:01.860 --> 30:02.860
Well that's just it, right?

30:02.860 --> 30:05.980
I mean most of the time the gifts are just something to show that you're thinking and

30:05.980 --> 30:10.420
have care for those people and what's better than spending some time working on a project.

30:10.420 --> 30:13.420
Well this really got kicked off into high gear when Michael wrote into the show.

30:13.420 --> 30:16.040
This is what happens when we start reading the feedback more, Wes.

30:16.040 --> 30:21.940
He wrote in and said, I recall back in episode 230 that Wes was setting up a NAS for his

30:21.940 --> 30:22.940
family.

30:22.940 --> 30:29.780
Well, fast forward and now I've decided that in 2020 it's my goal to do the same thing.

30:29.780 --> 30:32.900
He's wondering also if you have any updates, but wants to know how would you do it today

30:32.900 --> 30:35.580
if you're going to go about it and what would you build?

30:35.580 --> 30:40.120
He also says thanks for the amazing podcast, Michael subscribing from Germany.

30:40.120 --> 30:43.260
So he wants to know if we were going to do the same thing, give the family or a gift

30:43.260 --> 30:47.360
of like a Linux box or something that solves a problem out of the box, what would our approach

30:47.360 --> 30:49.340
be today?

30:49.340 --> 30:52.460
And I think it's pretty different than it was a couple of years ago.

30:52.460 --> 30:57.900
A couple of years ago, I wouldn't have had as nearly as many small board computer type

30:57.900 --> 30:58.900
projects.

30:58.900 --> 30:59.900
No.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.860
They use raspberry pies or, or the pine 64, right?

31:01.860 --> 31:07.220
I ended up deploying a NUC at my folks house kind of for that reason, but in those situations

31:07.220 --> 31:09.620
it's several hundreds of dollars.

31:09.620 --> 31:12.700
And now this year it's like, well, this is 35 bucks to do this.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.540
This one's going to be 60 bucks to do that.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.100
That's gift category right there.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.100
Exactly.

31:17.100 --> 31:21.420
So I am not doing this one, but I almost pulled this one off from my mom this year.

31:21.420 --> 31:22.980
It just didn't quite work out.

31:22.980 --> 31:28.300
I'm really going to recommend people consider giving the gift of network backups and you

31:28.300 --> 31:30.340
can make it really easy.

31:30.340 --> 31:35.820
There is a piece of open source software that has saved my bacon a few times and it's called

31:35.820 --> 31:37.500
backup PC.

31:37.500 --> 31:44.260
It's a brilliant, brilliant backup software that works over SSH and Samba and NFS and

31:44.260 --> 31:45.900
various other networking protocols.

31:45.900 --> 31:48.460
You can support all operating systems.

31:48.460 --> 31:51.020
It's easy to deploy as a Docker image.

31:51.020 --> 31:55.160
It's a little challenging to deploy on your system itself, but you can.

31:55.160 --> 31:59.260
And I think backup PC, even if it's just one or two computers and a USB hard drive plugged

31:59.260 --> 32:03.020
into a PI would be a fantastic gift.

32:03.020 --> 32:06.780
And if they already have a computer on the network that would be capable of this, you

32:06.780 --> 32:09.100
can load backup PC on that for them.

32:09.100 --> 32:14.340
And it's backup PC gives you a nice web UI to backup and restore files.

32:14.340 --> 32:19.660
And one of the things that's really smart about is eliminating duplicate images by looking

32:19.660 --> 32:24.260
at the block hash, I don't actually recall how it does it, but I'm going, I assume it

32:24.260 --> 32:28.140
hashes the files, looks at each, it does a hash for all the files and then it compares

32:28.140 --> 32:29.140
the hashes.

32:29.140 --> 32:32.500
And when there's duplicate hashes, it sets up hard links instead of actually copying

32:32.500 --> 32:33.960
the file a bunch of times.

32:33.960 --> 32:39.540
And so you end up using a surprising little amount of disk space, having backed up.

32:39.540 --> 32:44.300
So network servers and ZFS, we could have it all stored on ZFS.

32:44.300 --> 32:48.960
And then one other is just don't do, I'm not doing, but I think you could do.

32:48.960 --> 32:53.180
And I almost did for my dad this year, Pi-hole.

32:53.180 --> 32:54.780
We talk about it a lot.

32:54.780 --> 32:57.220
Pi-hole is a black hole for internet advertisements.

32:57.220 --> 33:01.140
You throw it on a device, you set it up for the family members, you tweak their DHCP.

33:01.140 --> 33:04.580
And now on every device they own forever, they've got ad blocking.

33:04.580 --> 33:08.900
What I like about that is ad blocking is fairly easy if you know what you're doing, but that's

33:08.900 --> 33:10.940
not always where your family members are, right?

33:10.940 --> 33:12.080
So this is something you can put in place.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.500
They don't have to think about it.

33:13.500 --> 33:17.200
You should probably tell them about it, I suppose, otherwise you won't get credit.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.180
But after that, it just works.

33:19.180 --> 33:22.340
DM, you have a backup solution for people?

33:22.340 --> 33:24.700
It's called Veeam Agent.

33:24.700 --> 33:28.980
They have Veeam Agent for Linux, Veeam Agent for Windows.

33:28.980 --> 33:36.020
It's not open source, but it's really good because you can backup the system and then

33:36.020 --> 33:38.380
you can do bare metal restore.

33:38.380 --> 33:43.500
So you can pretty much restore the whole system or restore a single file.

33:43.500 --> 33:44.500
That's nice.

33:44.500 --> 33:49.140
When you install the app, it lets you create like a recovery media.

33:49.140 --> 33:55.380
And it's really good for, especially for people that, it's kind of like you backup everything

33:55.380 --> 33:58.300
and then you pick whatever you want to restore after.

33:58.300 --> 34:04.180
Which most of the time people even, they don't know what they want until it's too late.

34:04.180 --> 34:08.500
And they don't know how valuable it is and how much they appreciate it until they need

34:08.500 --> 34:09.500
it.

34:09.500 --> 34:10.840
It really is a thing.

34:10.840 --> 34:17.220
It also does deduplication on the backup level, so you also kind of like save a lot of space

34:17.220 --> 34:18.740
on the backups and stuff.

34:18.740 --> 34:26.020
So I've been using it on a large enterprise scale, but it's also free for home users and

34:26.020 --> 34:27.020
stuff like that.

34:27.020 --> 34:29.020
So it's open source, but it's great.

34:29.020 --> 34:30.580
Veeam gets a plus one from me.

34:30.580 --> 34:33.900
I use it all the time in my network.

34:33.900 --> 34:38.980
Also worth an honorable mention in the PyHole category is the newer AdGuard Home, which

34:38.980 --> 34:43.780
can also run on a Pi as well, which does much the same thing, but I find generally I prefer

34:43.780 --> 34:45.100
the interface to AdGuard.

34:45.100 --> 34:46.700
Yeah, I've been meaning to try that.

34:46.700 --> 34:47.820
That does look really good.

34:47.820 --> 34:50.100
That's a good mention.

34:50.100 --> 34:55.020
And I thought maybe there's still a chance I might do one of these.

34:55.020 --> 34:57.580
So I wanted to put them on this list.

34:57.580 --> 35:00.500
Wes and I have two particular projects we are doing for our family this year, which

35:00.500 --> 35:01.500
we'll tell you about.

35:01.500 --> 35:05.540
But I want to take a moment to talk about the obvious elephant in the room.

35:05.540 --> 35:11.440
It is so easy these days to build a tiny little retro arcade machine.

35:11.440 --> 35:20.500
It's so easy that you could even gift it in a tiny retro NES case for 30 bucks.

35:20.500 --> 35:21.760
I have it linked in the show notes.

35:21.760 --> 35:24.780
You get an NES case built to hold the Raspberry Pi.

35:24.780 --> 35:25.960
Look at that handsome thing.

35:25.960 --> 35:27.300
You get a cooling fan.

35:27.300 --> 35:33.200
You get two USB Super Nintendo ripoff controllers that plug into the ports in the front that

35:33.200 --> 35:34.200
are USB.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.820
It's not just mix and match, why that controller doesn't make sense with the case.

35:36.820 --> 35:38.340
But that's fine.

35:38.340 --> 35:41.580
If somebody were to open this and you tell them, yeah, it does HDMI out, you can plug

35:41.580 --> 35:45.580
it into your current TV and play all your old favorite games, they would love this little

35:45.580 --> 35:46.580
thing.

35:46.580 --> 35:47.580
I mean, it is adorable.

35:47.580 --> 35:50.740
Right, great for kids or just old farts who still love video games.

35:50.740 --> 35:53.780
I'm going on a holiday shopping trip with my dad, I do it every year.

35:53.780 --> 35:57.460
And I always try to drop a few hints to see like what he bites on.

35:57.460 --> 35:59.820
And this is definitely on the possibilities list.

35:59.820 --> 36:05.880
Because it's just a presentation of the whole thing where it's in a retro Nintendo case.

36:05.880 --> 36:14.380
And you can load it with something called, I'm going to say, Laka, L-A-K-K-A, Laka.

36:14.380 --> 36:20.260
It's a DIY open source retro gaming console distro that you can flash on a device or you

36:20.260 --> 36:22.580
can load on even on an x86 machine.

36:22.580 --> 36:26.280
And it's got a sort of a PlayStation inspired UI.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.380
So if you like the PS3 UI style and the PS4.

36:29.380 --> 36:30.380
Oh, nice.

36:30.380 --> 36:31.380
A little more PS3, PS2.

36:31.380 --> 36:32.380
But it's nice.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.220
It's a classic side scrolling UI.

36:34.220 --> 36:35.820
Something very easy.

36:35.820 --> 36:36.820
Looks really good.

36:36.820 --> 36:38.500
And of course, cheese, you love RetroArch.

36:38.500 --> 36:42.000
Yeah, RetroArch is fantastic.

36:42.000 --> 36:47.460
And you can extend that, which is basically what Laka uses on the back end.

36:47.460 --> 36:52.380
But you can extend that to all of the consoles that are out there right now.

36:52.380 --> 36:57.160
Apparently, even it supports iOS and Apple TV.

36:57.160 --> 37:01.220
So if you're really into retro gaming, that's probably a great solution for you as well

37:01.220 --> 37:02.220
to look at.

37:02.220 --> 37:10.980
Maybe, although you built me a little Odroid Go Game Boy like thing that is also one of

37:10.980 --> 37:13.500
those like perfect kind of gifts at the holidays.

37:13.500 --> 37:17.540
Tell me a little bit about this because I've got it in my hands right now and it looks

37:17.540 --> 37:18.540
slick.

37:18.540 --> 37:21.340
It's got a transparent case so you can see the board in there and you can see the battery,

37:21.340 --> 37:22.340
which is super cool.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.780
And it's shaped like an old Game Boy.

37:24.780 --> 37:31.740
Yeah, so the Odroid Go is very similar to Adafruit's Pie Girl, which it's kind of a

37:31.740 --> 37:36.340
Game Boy sort of handheld console, retro handheld console.

37:36.340 --> 37:41.980
But what differs from the Pie Girl and Odroid Go, first off, Odroid makes single board computers

37:41.980 --> 37:43.260
as well.

37:43.260 --> 37:49.120
But this uses the ESP32 microcontroller instead of a Raspberry Pi.

37:49.120 --> 37:53.560
So you're going to get a lot more battery, you're going to get a lot more playtime out

37:53.560 --> 37:54.560
of it.

37:54.560 --> 37:58.540
It also has a header on top so you can break out that header.

37:58.540 --> 38:03.940
I think they have, there you go, I think that header will allow you to expand it and do

38:03.940 --> 38:04.940
some other things.

38:04.940 --> 38:10.900
They have some attachments for it, I'm not sure exactly what attachments are available

38:10.900 --> 38:11.900
for it right now.

38:11.900 --> 38:15.400
I think there's a microphone or something like that available for it.

38:15.400 --> 38:19.480
And you can also just, since it's a microcontroller, you can play with it and you can have it do

38:19.480 --> 38:20.680
just about anything you want.

38:20.680 --> 38:26.900
So if you wanted to turn it into a portable weather station or a tricorder of sorts, you

38:26.900 --> 38:28.980
could do that with this little device.

38:28.980 --> 38:29.980
A tricorder?

38:29.980 --> 38:30.980
I don't know.

38:30.980 --> 38:31.980
Pool holder?

38:31.980 --> 38:33.900
It's really, it's super simple, right?

38:33.900 --> 38:37.860
So instead of having to solder it all together, it comes as a kit and you can assemble it,

38:37.860 --> 38:40.720
but it's really easy to assemble, really easy to put together.

38:40.720 --> 38:44.580
So it's something that you could hand your kid and say, hey, you know, put this together,

38:44.580 --> 38:45.580
build something.

38:45.580 --> 38:48.260
And they would have this, you know, sense of accomplishment once they put it together

38:48.260 --> 38:51.380
and fired it up and got their first games going on it, for sure.

38:51.380 --> 38:52.900
Yeah, I love it.

38:52.900 --> 38:53.900
It's one of my favorite little things.

38:53.900 --> 38:58.020
And I love also just showing it to my kids and be like, here, this is what video games

38:58.020 --> 39:02.380
was like when I was your age, you know, I do one of those moves with it, which is extremely

39:02.380 --> 39:06.120
satisfying because I can be like, see if you can beat that kid.

39:06.120 --> 39:07.940
It's a really nice little gift.

39:07.940 --> 39:13.360
And I think anybody new or old gamer would be very, very happy with this thing.

39:13.360 --> 39:17.920
So we have links to this stuff, the Odre Go and the kit in the show notes.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.100
You got to check that out.

39:20.100 --> 39:23.260
But I love some of the ideas that came in from the audience.

39:23.260 --> 39:24.260
Dennis sent me an idea.

39:24.260 --> 39:31.380
He says, when you have a Raspberry Pi around a 3B plus somewhere level or better, if you

39:31.380 --> 39:34.800
have endless options, you have all kinds of things you can do.

39:34.800 --> 39:40.180
He built, we'll have a link to this to check this out in the show notes, a beautiful wood

39:40.180 --> 39:41.180
case around this thing.

39:41.180 --> 39:42.180
Look at that.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.980
I mean, I don't know if he hand built this or if he assembled it from various parts or

39:44.980 --> 39:51.500
what he did, but he put an LCD screen inside a, like a maple stained case.

39:51.500 --> 39:53.340
It's a gorgeous little computer right there.

39:53.340 --> 39:56.380
Just got a little little wireless keyboard and mouse connected.

39:56.380 --> 39:57.380
That's all you need.

39:57.380 --> 40:00.540
And he can put it in photo frame mode if he wants when he's not using it.

40:00.540 --> 40:02.100
So he's also got a little photo frame there.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.100
That's so slick.

40:03.100 --> 40:04.320
It's a great idea.

40:04.320 --> 40:09.420
So you can get a little inspiration by checking out the pictures there.

40:09.420 --> 40:13.980
But it's also worth mentioning, you could set somebody up a Kodi jellyfin setup on

40:13.980 --> 40:17.460
a Raspberry Pi and give it to him and say, here, plug this into your television.

40:17.460 --> 40:19.540
This is set up now to connect to my jellyfin library.

40:19.540 --> 40:23.860
Yeah, I had that set up with MB for a while, but I'm going to try it out with jellyfin,

40:23.860 --> 40:25.460
I think, over this holidays.

40:25.460 --> 40:29.620
And I just like that it makes it easy to share anything I'm watching with my family.

40:29.620 --> 40:31.100
And they don't have to learn any sort of new interface.

40:31.100 --> 40:32.720
They've been using Kodi before.

40:32.720 --> 40:36.700
So once the database backends plugged right in and you can do the same thing with Plex,

40:36.700 --> 40:38.940
they just keep on going and magically new content appears.

40:38.940 --> 40:39.940
Yeah, it's nice to see.

40:39.940 --> 40:44.620
I'd like figures that it would exist, but it's nice to see a jellyfin plugin for Kodi's

40:44.620 --> 40:49.860
or jellyfin app in Kodi so you can keep using the Kodi player and all of that.

40:49.860 --> 40:52.100
But you can get that jellyfin database.

40:52.100 --> 40:55.780
What a great way to share family movies, too, even if it's just for that kind of stuff.

40:55.780 --> 40:58.000
So that's an obvious one.

40:58.000 --> 41:03.660
But Wes, you're going like a whole other level with this one.

41:03.660 --> 41:08.260
For this year, you're building essentially Sonos in a box.

41:08.260 --> 41:10.060
It's not Sonos speakers.

41:10.060 --> 41:12.860
No, it's speakers powered by the Raspberry Pi.

41:12.860 --> 41:18.100
It turns out there's a whole bunch of high-end audio file gear that's made for the Raspberry

41:18.100 --> 41:22.180
Pi, all kinds of different hats and attachments and DACs that you can get so that if you want

41:22.180 --> 41:28.420
to drive speakers of basically any kind, you can use a Pi properly configured to do that.

41:28.420 --> 41:33.580
And there's a whole bunch, almost too many options for Linux of synchronizing audio to

41:33.580 --> 41:34.580
multiple devices.

41:34.580 --> 41:37.300
So if you can marry those two things, I think you're set.

41:37.300 --> 41:39.780
I haven't decided quite on the stack I want.

41:39.780 --> 41:44.340
A new one I saw was Strobe Audio, which if people remember from the Kodi radio days,

41:44.340 --> 41:48.780
I'm a lover of things hipsters like Elm and Elixir, and both of those technologies are

41:48.780 --> 41:50.140
in Strobe.

41:50.140 --> 41:53.820
But there's also an old favorite, Snapcast, which will do the same sort of thing.

41:53.820 --> 41:54.820
Okay.

41:54.820 --> 41:56.220
I really think Strobe Audio is worth a go.

41:56.220 --> 41:58.660
It looks really solid.

41:58.660 --> 42:01.740
And the thing that this does that I think is worth just wrapping your noodle around for

42:01.740 --> 42:07.180
a second is it allows you to get synchronized audio from any speaker.

42:07.180 --> 42:11.780
You got some old computer speakers sitting around or you've got great home entertainment

42:11.780 --> 42:12.860
speakers.

42:12.860 --> 42:17.340
You've got a whole range of options, which means you can fill audio in anywhere in your

42:17.340 --> 42:18.340
home.

42:18.340 --> 42:20.780
Like everybody probably has an old computer speaker somewhere and you want just a little

42:20.780 --> 42:23.620
bit of mid somewhere, just add it to that.

42:23.620 --> 42:27.660
So Strobe Audio, amongst the others, looks like a great option to handle all of that

42:27.660 --> 42:31.060
math over the network, make sure everybody's talking the same lingo at the same time.

42:31.060 --> 42:32.060
Right.

42:32.060 --> 42:34.740
I mean, you know, Sonos and similar products are definitely out there, but not only are

42:34.740 --> 42:37.120
they expensive, they have their own way of operating.

42:37.120 --> 42:40.300
And I don't, I just don't think that that's right for the people in my life and people

42:40.300 --> 42:43.420
that they know and something that can integrate with their existing systems and maybe even

42:43.420 --> 42:47.380
just take input from, say, a CD player, it's going to be a lot more flexible.

42:47.380 --> 42:53.860
I like this a lot because I was gifted an old set of theater speakers by my dad when

42:53.860 --> 42:58.220
he upgraded to like a Sonos sound bar, of course, he's like, here, you want all these

42:58.220 --> 42:59.220
old speakers?

42:59.220 --> 43:03.940
And I'm like, dad, these are great speakers, but he doesn't want to deal with all the hassle

43:03.940 --> 43:04.940
of wiring them all up.

43:04.940 --> 43:08.940
This I could easily use, especially with some of these DACs you link, that's really cool.

43:08.940 --> 43:12.940
So strobe audio on a Raspberry Pi, and then audio out.

43:12.940 --> 43:17.260
So what I was thinking you could do is just a really simple, cheap, just USB sound card.

43:17.260 --> 43:20.260
Yeah, it doesn't have to be, you don't even have to go fancy DAC unless you're really

43:20.260 --> 43:21.260
aiming at high end speakers.

43:21.260 --> 43:22.260
But you're right.

43:22.260 --> 43:24.760
Yeah, especially for things you just want something in the bathroom or a kitchen device

43:24.760 --> 43:25.760
while you're cooking.

43:25.760 --> 43:28.940
I mean, like 70% of what I would use this would be podcasts.

43:28.940 --> 43:32.380
I just want, I want to walk around everywhere and hear the podcast.

43:32.380 --> 43:33.740
So here's another project.

43:33.740 --> 43:37.820
I didn't include it in the doc, I'd like to extend some Wi Fi from from the main house

43:37.820 --> 43:39.740
that my folks have down to their sheds.

43:39.740 --> 43:40.740
Yeah.

43:40.740 --> 43:45.180
Oh, and then if I could get this going to write, you could have same music, both places.

43:45.180 --> 43:46.180
Yeah.

43:46.180 --> 43:47.420
Sonos, but not quite.

43:47.420 --> 43:48.420
I like that.

43:48.420 --> 43:49.420
All right.

43:49.420 --> 43:50.420
So here's what I'm doing.

43:50.420 --> 43:54.060
This is kind of on theme for me in the last year, especially now that Alex is the devil

43:54.060 --> 43:55.060
on my shoulder.

43:55.060 --> 43:58.980
I'm giving the gift of self hosted automation for Christmas.

43:58.980 --> 44:00.580
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

44:00.580 --> 44:01.580
Why?

44:01.580 --> 44:02.580
I thought you'd love the idea.

44:02.580 --> 44:06.220
I've got this picture of a little me, me, me, me, me, me in your shoulder.

44:06.220 --> 44:07.220
Oh, that part.

44:07.220 --> 44:08.220
Yeah, I know.

44:08.220 --> 44:09.220
Tell me about it.

44:09.220 --> 44:10.220
Right.

44:10.220 --> 44:11.780
Hey, Chris, buy this.

44:11.780 --> 44:13.940
No, I thought, you know what?

44:13.940 --> 44:19.940
I've got two Raspberry Pi threes and I'm going to put has IO on those suckers, which we talk

44:19.940 --> 44:21.100
more about in self-hosted.

44:21.100 --> 44:27.900
So check out selfhosted.show and I'm going to buy it with a cost of smart plug because

44:27.900 --> 44:31.980
home assistant has a built in integration to work over the land with the cost of smart

44:31.980 --> 44:38.340
plugs, which are made by TP link and I like a one pack is I think $20 you can get it or

44:38.340 --> 44:39.340
something like that.

44:39.340 --> 44:40.820
You can get a two pack for 35 bucks.

44:40.820 --> 44:42.180
Oh, we should talk.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.180
We should talk.

44:43.180 --> 44:44.260
We should get you a better plug than that.

44:44.260 --> 44:45.260
I know.

44:45.260 --> 44:46.260
But see, this isn't for me.

44:46.260 --> 44:47.260
This is for the family.

44:47.260 --> 44:51.420
So I, you know, I can get them this as a built in integration and I'm going to give them

44:51.420 --> 44:56.900
the gift of an automated smart tree because we just want something that's running Tasmota.

44:56.900 --> 44:57.900
That's what we want.

44:57.900 --> 44:58.900
I know.

44:58.900 --> 45:01.420
If you want to send me a plug to use, you got a couple of weeks.

45:01.420 --> 45:03.620
I can do that.

45:03.620 --> 45:06.300
But others, I'm going to link the TP link in there.

45:06.300 --> 45:12.140
It's all explained in self-hosted, but I think automating the Christmas tree is a great way

45:12.140 --> 45:17.700
to make it click for people and I'm just going to set it up for the smart plug to just have

45:17.700 --> 45:20.020
a sunrise sunset automation.

45:20.020 --> 45:22.260
So it's an hour before sunset, turn the tree on.

45:22.260 --> 45:23.260
All right.

45:23.260 --> 45:25.780
I'm stealing this because there's also great for like outside lights that you don't have

45:25.780 --> 45:26.780
to go out in the cold.

45:26.780 --> 45:27.780
Absolutely.

45:27.780 --> 45:28.780
Absolutely.

45:28.780 --> 45:32.380
Yes, if that's a, that'd be, that would be a killer angle.

45:32.380 --> 45:33.700
I hadn't even considered the outside.

45:33.700 --> 45:37.400
And if you combine it, I know I have got some, uh, some family members, a little skeptical

45:37.400 --> 45:39.820
of all these smart devices and just what's happening with their data.

45:39.820 --> 45:42.500
So you can also add in the gift of like, look, this is all offline.

45:42.500 --> 45:43.500
Yes.

45:43.500 --> 45:44.500
Yeah.

45:44.500 --> 45:49.860
Uh, TP link also makes an outdoor smart plug that has been weatherized with like perfect

45:49.860 --> 45:52.060
rubber covers and whatnot.

45:52.060 --> 45:56.540
Um, and I just think that's such a great way to be like, look, this is that for me, it's

45:56.540 --> 46:00.420
like, this is that thing I talk about all the time, you know, and I'm always talking

46:00.420 --> 46:03.820
about this thing and you know, it is useful and here it is.

46:03.820 --> 46:08.180
And when you put them and I have, I have an old flirt case for the raspberry PI three

46:08.180 --> 46:13.020
that I never used and I've got a raspberry PI three in the box still, and I'm just going

46:13.020 --> 46:14.940
to open them both up, put this together.

46:14.940 --> 46:19.140
I think I'll do Raspbian and then I'll do has IO.

46:19.140 --> 46:23.660
Well, I'm either going to do homocystin or has IO, I'm not sure which is has IO is like,

46:23.660 --> 46:24.660
it's a whole distro itself.

46:24.660 --> 46:25.660
So I could go that route.

46:25.660 --> 46:28.380
I'm going to decide what, because I do like the idea of being able to put other things

46:28.380 --> 46:29.380
on there.

46:29.380 --> 46:31.060
Are you wanting to run this as an appliance?

46:31.060 --> 46:32.820
Cause that's what it boils down to.

46:32.820 --> 46:33.820
That's what I got.

46:33.820 --> 46:36.820
That's the, do I want to run this as an appliance or do I also want to do other things for them?

46:36.820 --> 46:40.380
And I think the appliance angle is the way to go.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.260
Pitch it as a complete product.

46:42.260 --> 46:43.740
It does this.

46:43.740 --> 46:44.740
Yep.

46:44.740 --> 46:46.700
And uh, I think that's, I think I'll go has IO.

46:46.700 --> 46:48.620
And that's easier with all these small board computers, right?

46:48.620 --> 46:51.980
Cause if you need another appliance, you don't have to combine them, you just get another

46:51.980 --> 46:52.980
one.

46:52.980 --> 46:58.540
Something we're going to touch on before we wrap up is a super crazy, dead, easy, Nat

46:58.540 --> 47:02.940
busting way to remote support all of these things we're giving out.

47:02.940 --> 47:06.120
I am setting up remote access on everything this year.

47:06.120 --> 47:11.740
I am backdooring every box or I'm sorry, I'm setting up a service login on everything I

47:11.740 --> 47:12.740
give away this year.

47:12.740 --> 47:16.660
And we'll tell you how we're both West and I are doing that, but she's had a really great

47:16.660 --> 47:23.460
idea for a possible another take on the backup solution outside of my kind of half baked

47:23.460 --> 47:24.460
idea.

47:24.460 --> 47:30.060
I've been running open media vault on, uh, orange pie zero now for a little bit.

47:30.060 --> 47:34.300
Um, and it's, it's a great little easy to use backup solution.

47:34.300 --> 47:41.300
Um, so what I did is over black Friday, they had the Samsung Evo, uh, one terabyte SSDs

47:41.300 --> 47:42.780
on sale for a hundred bucks.

47:42.780 --> 47:43.780
Right.

47:43.780 --> 47:49.140
So for my brother and his entire family, immediate family, um, I'm setting up an orange pie zero,

47:49.140 --> 47:55.420
which is about a $10 single board computer paired with a little external, um, SSD case,

47:55.420 --> 48:00.780
uh, with that one terabyte drive set up in there and they have iPads and just some various

48:00.780 --> 48:05.980
little different, you know, laptops and odds and ends, um, that I wanted to be able for

48:05.980 --> 48:11.180
him to use to easily back up the whole household and still have access to, uh, in case they

48:11.180 --> 48:12.180
need it.

48:12.180 --> 48:16.580
So, you know, all in, I'm looking at about 120 bucks, but for me, this is going to cover

48:16.580 --> 48:17.940
a gift for four people.

48:17.940 --> 48:24.580
So, um, I felt it was a really reasonable, uh, amount of money to be spent for, you know,

48:24.580 --> 48:26.660
everyone to get their backup solution on.

48:26.660 --> 48:28.340
So that's, that's what I'm using.

48:28.340 --> 48:29.340
I like that.

48:29.340 --> 48:32.820
I like, see, the reason why I say mine's a half solution and yours is a complete solution

48:32.820 --> 48:34.460
is because you're going with open media vault.

48:34.460 --> 48:39.460
So it's an appliance, there's a web UI, you could even give them the URL and the login

48:39.460 --> 48:43.220
and they could, they could futz with it, whereas mine is like, I think I'd load Debbie in and

48:43.220 --> 48:46.900
then I harass me and then I think I'd do like, mine's a half baked idea, but that's a fully

48:46.900 --> 48:47.900
formed one.

48:47.900 --> 48:51.860
So I think that's really nice and good call on the orange pie zero.

48:51.860 --> 48:53.500
That's a nice little device for this.

48:53.500 --> 49:00.880
It's questionable if I'll give them the URL to log into, but I may just put a service

49:00.880 --> 49:03.900
door in there for myself as well.

49:03.900 --> 49:05.900
It's these white lies that keep families together.

49:05.900 --> 49:06.900
That's right.

49:06.900 --> 49:07.900
Everybody stays happy.

49:07.900 --> 49:12.780
So there is also a solution that's along all of these same lines that makes it really easy

49:12.780 --> 49:17.540
to one click install things like a wiki and mumble and next cloud, but it's not quite

49:17.540 --> 49:19.460
as DIY as everything we've been talking about.

49:19.460 --> 49:25.060
I've never tried the freedom box before, but it looks like a really cool project.

49:25.060 --> 49:31.860
Each freedom box includes a single board computer with an arm cortex, a seven processor running

49:31.860 --> 49:32.860
a gigahertz.

49:32.860 --> 49:39.500
It's got a gig of Ram, two USB, two ports, it's got gigabit, one native SATA drive and

49:39.500 --> 49:40.500
an HDMI port.

49:40.500 --> 49:45.260
And it comes with a 32 gigabyte micro SD card that has the freedom box software pre-installed.

49:45.260 --> 49:52.540
A couple of other neat things though, inside it's a little case, it has a built in battery.

49:52.540 --> 49:54.120
It sits inside the case.

49:54.120 --> 49:58.500
So the freedom box doesn't lose power if you lose electricity.

49:58.500 --> 49:59.500
Nice.

49:59.500 --> 50:01.380
I really like that.

50:01.380 --> 50:03.860
And it's running Debian under the hood.

50:03.860 --> 50:05.840
It's all running on top of Debian.

50:05.840 --> 50:11.940
So it's kind of a, it's a darling project of Debian, worth checking out the freedom

50:11.940 --> 50:12.940
box.

50:12.940 --> 50:18.100
I think it ran for 80 something dollars, 85 something dollars.

50:18.100 --> 50:23.520
And it's, it's got a platform that lets you just choose these massive open source software

50:23.520 --> 50:28.080
stacks as like a one click deployment at like, like VPS is do only it's on this little tiny

50:28.080 --> 50:29.820
freedom box that you put in your own network.

50:29.820 --> 50:33.620
It seems like a great way to introduce people who are interested in playing with the software

50:33.620 --> 50:36.660
but maybe aren't the most technical to get some of those benefits.

50:36.660 --> 50:37.660
All right.

50:37.660 --> 50:40.820
So let's talk about giving the gift of remote support with SSH.

50:40.820 --> 50:45.700
This is something you and I decided to do just for our own convenience and it's working

50:45.700 --> 50:46.860
out really well.

50:46.860 --> 50:49.120
So we thought we'd share it with the audience.

50:49.120 --> 50:54.020
We may have mentioned it maybe even one episode before, but Wes and I love the self healing

50:54.020 --> 50:57.820
reverse SSH tunnels that you set up using systemd.

50:57.820 --> 50:59.320
Oh yeah, it's so easy.

50:59.320 --> 51:03.740
And it's great because systemd is aware of your network state and all of these things

51:03.740 --> 51:08.660
that make it an ideal way to keep a persistent reverse connection.

51:08.660 --> 51:11.940
We'll have a link in the show notes.

51:11.940 --> 51:16.340
In short, you create a systemd unit file.

51:16.340 --> 51:20.740
It just sort of spells out how to do this SSH connection using the right command line

51:20.740 --> 51:23.900
flags and the right user information.

51:23.900 --> 51:25.420
And then you enable it and start it.

51:25.420 --> 51:31.340
And then there is a persistent, always on SSH connection to whatever you tell it to.

51:31.340 --> 51:33.340
In my case, it's a VPS.

51:33.340 --> 51:37.940
You will need some sort of publicly accessible bastion host out there to make this work really

51:37.940 --> 51:38.940
well.

51:38.940 --> 51:42.740
But I mean, come on, a lot of us already have one of these running somewhere.

51:42.740 --> 51:46.780
You could also get by with something forwarded on your own network if you needed to.

51:46.780 --> 51:51.500
If you have a public IP and you want to open the port, you could even have it connect back

51:51.500 --> 51:55.980
to an SSH, I mean, I'm sorry, you could have it connect back to a DNS address.

51:55.980 --> 51:58.580
I've hardcoded IP and no, actually, I did use DNS.

51:58.580 --> 52:00.900
So yeah, even if my IP changes, it's fine.

52:00.900 --> 52:02.900
If you have dynamic DNS, you'd be fine.

52:02.900 --> 52:07.660
And the idea here, really, you're just going to forward the port of your local SSH connection

52:07.660 --> 52:10.540
up onto that easily accessible server.

52:10.540 --> 52:16.740
And then you can use SSH's great support for jump hosts to just immediately jump right

52:16.740 --> 52:20.380
on through the bastion and get to whatever system you need, no matter how many levels

52:20.380 --> 52:21.380
of NAT are involved.

52:21.380 --> 52:22.380
Okay.

52:22.380 --> 52:23.380
All right.

52:23.380 --> 52:24.380
All right.

52:24.380 --> 52:26.540
We got to explain this just a little bit more, because this is such a fricking cool thing

52:26.540 --> 52:31.100
that SSH does that it's worth just everybody understanding what a jump host is.

52:31.100 --> 52:32.100
Right.

52:32.100 --> 52:35.260
So you used to be able to do this in all kinds of ways, including super hacky ones involving

52:35.260 --> 52:36.260
Netcat.

52:36.260 --> 52:41.020
But these days with modern SSH, the proxy jump feature is baked right in.

52:41.020 --> 52:44.860
And so you can just tell, you know, you tell SSH, hey, I want to go to this host.

52:44.860 --> 52:47.060
But you can tell it it needs a jump host.

52:47.060 --> 52:49.700
So it'll first establish an connection to the jump host.

52:49.700 --> 52:54.240
And then on that box using its DNS settings, whatever you need, it'll then go make the

52:54.240 --> 52:56.620
request to the host that you actually want to get to.

52:56.620 --> 52:57.620
So you can chain this.

52:57.620 --> 52:59.360
You can go many levels deep if you want to.

52:59.360 --> 53:01.180
But two is usually enough.

53:01.180 --> 53:07.220
My SSH config file is maybe 100 lines long because I just chain multiple boxes together.

53:07.220 --> 53:12.420
So I use proxy jump every day and it's wonderful.

53:12.420 --> 53:16.740
You can also specify nonstandard ports, users, all that kind of stuff in there.

53:16.740 --> 53:22.560
So, you know, the SSH config file is probably one of the most important, you know, second

53:22.560 --> 53:24.780
probably only to my SSH keys on my systems.

53:24.780 --> 53:25.780
Right.

53:25.780 --> 53:28.140
And that way, when, you know, when the person you're supporting gives you a call and says,

53:28.140 --> 53:29.820
hey, this isn't working, you don't have to worry about it.

53:29.820 --> 53:33.420
You can just type SSH, whatever name you've given it and you're in.

53:33.420 --> 53:36.380
And what I've done is I've made little notes to myself.

53:36.380 --> 53:38.660
So this computer is this jump address.

53:38.660 --> 53:40.140
This computer is this jump address.

53:40.140 --> 53:43.620
And when they say, hey, I need help, I'll just open up that text document, highlight,

53:43.620 --> 53:44.900
paste in my terminal and go.

53:44.900 --> 53:46.460
And I'll be on their system.

53:46.460 --> 53:48.940
I really set up the keys and everything.

53:48.940 --> 53:52.860
So I really, really strongly recommend either for yourself, if you need to get access to

53:52.860 --> 53:57.780
your machine, that's like even even my RV machines, which are behind double carrier

53:57.780 --> 53:58.780
grade gnats.

53:58.780 --> 54:00.580
Bob's your uncle, man.

54:00.580 --> 54:01.580
Works just fine.

54:01.580 --> 54:05.260
Richard is indeed my uncle now.

54:05.260 --> 54:06.260
We'll have links to that.

54:06.260 --> 54:07.460
We'll have links to explain the jump post.

54:07.460 --> 54:08.580
I've mentioned links a lot.

54:08.580 --> 54:13.260
So I realize I've been throwing that out there a ton this episode and I haven't said where

54:13.260 --> 54:14.260
you get those.

54:14.260 --> 54:15.260
And I apologize.

54:15.260 --> 54:16.260
It's just an old habit.

54:16.260 --> 54:20.740
Linux Unplugged dot com slash three three zero.

54:20.740 --> 54:22.660
And we'll have all of that stuff there.

54:22.660 --> 54:25.340
So you can you can get there, man.

54:25.340 --> 54:27.220
All of this really started because Michael sent in an email.

54:27.220 --> 54:28.220
So thank you, Michael.

54:28.220 --> 54:29.220
We would like more of that.

54:29.220 --> 54:32.620
If you're doing any of these or have similar projects in the works or know some great open

54:32.620 --> 54:37.260
source software we should be using to facilitate gift ideas, Linux Unplugged dot com slash

54:37.260 --> 54:38.260
contact.

54:38.260 --> 54:39.260
Yeah.

54:39.260 --> 54:40.260
Yeah.

54:40.260 --> 54:42.420
There's a lot of fun stuff out there.

54:42.420 --> 54:45.620
And if you're just even making it a project for yourself, I think it's worth checking

54:45.620 --> 54:47.060
out some of that stuff.

54:47.060 --> 54:52.260
We had something sort of amazing happen in the community that they didn't even know what

54:52.260 --> 54:53.260
happened.

54:53.260 --> 54:59.660
In my Linux Unplugged inbox came an email asking a question and then not even an hour

54:59.660 --> 55:04.900
later another email came into my inbox answering the previous question.

55:04.900 --> 55:08.340
So this is amazing because I was like, OK, we'll answer this.

55:08.340 --> 55:11.260
And then the next email that came in just did it beautifully.

55:11.260 --> 55:13.060
So let's start with Malik from Germany.

55:13.060 --> 55:14.060
Malik.

55:14.060 --> 55:15.060
Malik.

55:15.060 --> 55:20.540
We by the way, Germany has been representing hard working over there, Germany.

55:20.540 --> 55:21.540
I think we're proud of you.

55:21.540 --> 55:26.460
I think we got like four emails from Germany in this last week.

55:26.460 --> 55:30.720
And so Malik writes and he says, hey, Chris, happy listening and enjoy the Linux podcast

55:30.720 --> 55:35.380
quite a lot after listening to some interesting episodes on self hosted and also your episodes

55:35.380 --> 55:36.380
on VPNs.

55:36.380 --> 55:40.820
I came to the conclusion that you might have some ideas to solve my very specific networking

55:40.820 --> 55:41.820
problem.

55:41.820 --> 55:44.820
You see, I'm a web developer by trade and I like to tinker a bit in my home network

55:44.820 --> 55:46.020
from time to time.

55:46.020 --> 55:47.020
But there's one problem.

55:47.020 --> 55:50.020
I just can't get my head around yet when I'm out and about.

55:50.020 --> 55:55.180
I would like to VPN to all my machines, my Linux notebook, my Apple mobile devices back

55:55.180 --> 55:58.060
in my home from any of my devices.

55:58.060 --> 55:59.060
Why?

55:59.060 --> 56:00.780
Well, I love Pi-Hole, of course.

56:00.780 --> 56:04.660
And well, I'd like to access through Pi-Hole when I'm out on public Internet.

56:04.660 --> 56:07.420
And I'd also like to get access to my file servers and that kind of stuff.

56:07.420 --> 56:08.580
But what's the problem?

56:08.580 --> 56:09.580
You might ask.

56:09.580 --> 56:17.220
I've got no public IP for address since my Internet provider is using something called

56:17.220 --> 56:19.180
DS Lite.

56:19.180 --> 56:25.740
OK, I did quite a bit of research and I can't find a way to connect to my home, but it seems

56:25.740 --> 56:32.820
there may be a way to do it because I have an IP six address available.

56:32.820 --> 56:34.340
I don't know how to use this right.

56:34.340 --> 56:35.340
So here's my question.

56:35.340 --> 56:40.540
Do you know of a specific guide or tutorial that discusses a multi-platform approach to

56:40.540 --> 56:46.220
connecting home with only an IP V6 public address available?

56:46.220 --> 56:47.780
I say, yes, we do.

56:47.780 --> 56:51.780
But then Lucas writes and he says, hey, there, I heard you had problems with carrier grade

56:51.780 --> 56:54.140
now and I felt the urge to write in.

56:54.140 --> 57:01.460
I also sit behind a carrier grade at my German ISP and I took it took me a while to find

57:01.460 --> 57:02.820
a solution that works for me.

57:02.820 --> 57:05.140
See, we're bringing Germans together on this podcast.

57:05.140 --> 57:10.620
At least with my ISP, the carrier grade net is only active for IP for addresses.

57:10.620 --> 57:18.140
So what I did is I rented a super small VPS at I O N O S dot D E and I installed a tool

57:18.140 --> 57:28.020
called six tunnel, which allows you to tunnel IP for traffic through an IP six connection.

57:28.020 --> 57:30.260
And this has worked brilliantly for him.

57:30.260 --> 57:33.260
He's able to get back to his home network.

57:33.260 --> 57:37.540
I don't know if you really consider it a VPN, he says, but it sure has solved my problem.

57:37.540 --> 57:43.100
Wes, educate me a little bit about six tunnel, because I believe there's other solutions

57:43.100 --> 57:44.100
as well.

57:44.100 --> 57:46.340
But six tunnel looks pretty straightforward.

57:46.340 --> 57:47.340
Looks pretty nice.

57:47.340 --> 57:49.860
Yeah, I'd actually never used it before.

57:49.860 --> 57:50.860
It is kept up to date.

57:50.860 --> 57:53.620
You see project over on GitHub if you want to check it out.

57:53.620 --> 57:58.420
It'll be in the show notes and it allows you to use services provided by IP V6 hosts with

57:58.420 --> 58:02.860
IP V4 only applications and vice versa.

58:02.860 --> 58:06.920
So it's really just a little flexible little connector you can put in between things.

58:06.920 --> 58:10.780
If you're on one end and you can't talk quite what you need to stick six tunnel in the middle

58:10.780 --> 58:13.100
and it'll figure things out for you.

58:13.100 --> 58:18.300
Yeah, it can be used as a tunnel for all combinations IP for traffic so you could pretty much run

58:18.300 --> 58:20.780
anything through it.

58:20.780 --> 58:22.660
And it looks like it also has a lot of flexibility.

58:22.660 --> 58:27.580
I have a link to the man page in the notes and I'm reading through it right now.

58:27.580 --> 58:29.900
Okay, this is something I'm going to look into.

58:29.900 --> 58:34.340
I had also you and I at one point had talked about other solutions using IP V6.

58:34.340 --> 58:38.300
So it seems like the audience is sort of clicked into something that you and I were also kind

58:38.300 --> 58:39.980
of orbiting around.

58:39.980 --> 58:45.660
And I want to also mention that I had a follow up email from Ryan, the developer of Nebula.

58:45.660 --> 58:52.060
And he gave me the suggestion of configuring both of my Nebula clients behind that with

58:52.060 --> 58:53.060
ports of zero.

58:53.060 --> 58:56.500
So they randomly select ports when they're trying to break through the net.

58:56.500 --> 58:58.020
Sounds like we've got some more testing to do.

58:58.020 --> 59:00.860
Yep, so I will test that indeed.

59:00.860 --> 59:04.340
And hopefully that answered some questions if you've got some follow up or feedback or

59:04.340 --> 59:09.560
ideas for the show, like Wes mentioned earlier, Linux unpluged.com slash contact.

59:09.560 --> 59:11.480
That's how you get into the show.

59:11.480 --> 59:14.780
We're trying to do just a little bit more of that towards the end of the year just to

59:14.780 --> 59:16.260
hear from everybody.

59:16.260 --> 59:20.420
Get some different stuff on the air because we always read the emails, but we don't always

59:20.420 --> 59:21.540
feature them on air.

59:21.540 --> 59:24.300
But I thought something about this time of year feels like the right time.

59:24.300 --> 59:25.300
Right.

59:25.300 --> 59:29.420
And that's one of the best ways we get to hear directly from you and we love that now.

59:29.420 --> 59:30.780
Check out user error.

59:30.780 --> 59:35.340
Dan wasn't able to make it on because of internet connections, but error.show.

59:35.340 --> 59:36.340
So good.

59:36.340 --> 59:37.340
User error.

59:37.340 --> 59:38.700
One of my favorite podcasts of all time.

59:38.700 --> 59:39.700
Go check it out.

59:39.700 --> 59:43.100
And if there's one of our podcasts to share with your friends and family over this upcoming

59:43.100 --> 59:44.580
holidays, it's user error.

59:44.580 --> 59:45.580
For sure.

59:45.580 --> 59:46.580
It is.

59:46.580 --> 59:48.060
It's the one I listened to with the lady and she loves it.

59:48.060 --> 59:49.900
It makes me laugh every time.

59:49.900 --> 59:54.820
Techsnap.systems for more Wes Payne with Jim Salter talking about things over there and

59:54.820 --> 59:59.060
check out Alex and I on self hosted self hosted dot show.

59:59.060 --> 01:00:02.260
New episode is coming out this week and it's packed.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:03.260
It's packed.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.260
It's packed.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.260
And don't forget about my Friday stream.

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:09.220
I don't know if it's a good idea or not and I need you to like go to that get together

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:11.460
thing so I know if I should even bother.

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:12.580
I know I'm very needy.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.980
We listen to you, but I thought this would be a good thing.

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:15.980
Distros and drinks.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.980
What could go wrong?

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:42.860
See you back here next Tuesday.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:59.500
All right.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.500
Now we need them titles.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.500
JBtitles.com.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.700
We all go vote something.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.700
Something fun.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.740
You know, I enjoyed this episode.

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:08.860
I think it should be a fun one.

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:12.860
The gift of Linux is not I think it's a little too on the nose.

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:13.860
Have you looked to see what's trending?

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:14.860
All right.

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:15.860
Let's go check it out.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:16.860
JBtitles.com.

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:17.860
Let's investigate, you know.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:18.860
Just the gift of Germans.

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:20.700
I don't think we don't have enough votes.

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.300
So everybody go vote.

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.300
It's urgent.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:26.060
I've been keeping an eye on that Gnome Shell and Mudder development blog.

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:27.060
Yes.

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:31.780
They're working on something really cool that is going to make Mudder even better.

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:35.580
So one of the areas they've tried to focus on is just the general improvements of Mudder

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.620
like we touched on with Cassidy, right?

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:42.100
Well now they're working on really, really specific update areas.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:45.300
So Mudder only has to update small little bits of the screen.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:49.100
Much quicker, less work, less overhead.

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.100
Way better.

01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:51.100
Way, way better.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.100
Right.

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:54.140
And that's exactly the kind of change that will stumble I think very far downstream.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:59.820
So as the way they put it, Mudder has received the ability to update multiple regions independently

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:02.820
without using bounding rectangles.

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.580
I love developers.

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:08.500
And they have some screenshots that actually make it a little more obvious.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.980
There's a lot of other highlights on there.

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:14.420
But like I said, like I promised, I'm keeping an eye on this Gnome Shell and Mudder development

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:20.040
blog because it's so inspiring to see what they're working on and have a better appreciation

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.300
as to I can feel the desktop getting better, but why is it getting better?

01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:27.020
And what are the hard parts of this that otherwise we would have no idea about?

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:30.140
I can't help but respect their work even more when they do this.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:36.860
And it's a really well done post with, like I said, screenshots, but also tons of links

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:38.200
properly laid out.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.060
There's real thought to the organization of it.

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:42.540
There's an embedded video of the app grid improvements.

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.620
I think you really have to call out how much work that is, right?

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:45.860
You've already done all the code change.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.260
That's a lot of work in and of itself.

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:50.660
But then to go write up a blog post, that's also a significant amount of work.

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.460
Yeah, it takes a long time and they're nailing it.

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.460
They've really stuck to it.

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:55.980
So really impressed with it.

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.340
I'll have a link to that as well because it's worth following.

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:13.220
I just put it in my feed reader and I'm just going to see what they're doing.
