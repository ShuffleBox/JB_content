1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Not to start two shows out in a row with a system D joke,

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,640
but Knoppix 8.6 is out,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,040
the new release is based on Debian 10 Buster,

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,640
and they've ripped out that system D.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,800
Well, yeah, I mean, you just write whatever you want

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,560
in etsyrc.local, Chris.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,560
It's easy.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,960
You don't need a system D unit.

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,960
Oh, hey there, and welcome into Linux Unplugged,

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,600
your weekly Linux talk show.

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,440
My name is Chris.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,280
My name is Wes.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,360
Hello, Mr. Payne, and let's not wait another moment.

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,200
Let's bring Brent in too.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,020
Hey, Brent.

16
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,860
Hello.

17
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,680
In studio.

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,520
Nice to see you.

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,340
Always good to be here.

20
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,360
Nice to see you.

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,240
Good to have both of you here,

22
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,240
and of course, we've got Cheesy, Alex, and Drew as well.

23
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,240
Hello, gentlemen.

24
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,200
Hello.

25
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,320
Miss you guys.

26
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,800
I miss you too.

27
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,640
Yeah.

28
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,580
So they're not in studio with us,

29
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,700
but they were last week.

30
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,720
Everybody was in studio last week.

31
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,280
I mean, this is the next best thing.

32
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,520
At least we get to hear each other.

33
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,600
Yeah, it is nice.

34
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,200
I mean, this is what we're familiar with.

35
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,480
We have post-sprint depression right now.

36
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,320
A little bit.

37
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,040
It's nice to have Brent still here

38
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
cooking me brunch though.

39
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,800
Like, that's kind of helped smooth out the transition.

40
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,960
So I appreciate that, Brent.

41
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,240
It's a community service, really.

42
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,080
It is.

43
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,440
Keeping your podcaster happy keeps the shows good.

44
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,240
And of course, our virtual lug is here.

45
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,800
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

46
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,020
Hello.

47
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,960
Hello.

48
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,160
Hello.

49
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,980
Hello.

50
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,820
Hello, good to see you.

51
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,440
Bite and Dill's in there, hello.

52
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,360
And of course, Mini Mac as well,

53
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
and more joining as the show goes on.

54
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,100
That's cool.

55
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,120
Full house today, I love it.

56
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,360
The Mumble Room is always available

57
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,480
if you'd like to participate.

58
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,080
And we start this week with some community news, as always.

59
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,560
And it's a big headline from System76.

60
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,720
They have a new firmware manager

61
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,720
that updates both from their own repository and from LVFS.

62
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,800
Each components, the System76 firmware

63
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,160
and the LVFS component are also removable.

64
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,620
So if you wanted to deploy this graphical firmware

65
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,560
update tool they've built in Rust, by the way,

66
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,080
you could actually remove the System76 component

67
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,060
and just use it anywhere.

68
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,940
But the beauty is for System76 customers,

69
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,920
they'll now have a central location in GNOME settings

70
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,320
to update both LVFS firmwares

71
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,240
and their vendor-specific firmwares.

72
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,480
And this is important for them in particular

73
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,040
and other distributions like elementary

74
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,560
because they don't use GNOME software.

75
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,320
Right, if you just happen to be one of those distros

76
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,840
that has your own application center,

77
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
there wasn't really a solution before this.

78
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,720
This is pretty neat, the way they've built this,

79
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,760
making the System76 part modular.

80
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,600
I like that.

81
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,420
I mean, I think it shows,

82
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,320
that was kind of one of our big criticisms.

83
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,240
It was great that they were managing firmware,

84
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,420
getting it updated,

85
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,720
but there were kind of two players in this space

86
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,080
and okay, maybe they don't have to perfectly mesh,

87
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,560
but at least now we're playing ball

88
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,720
in a polite and friendly, open way.

89
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,640
I think the question has been,

90
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,800
well, why not just use LVFS completely?

91
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,640
Yes.

92
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,200
And my understanding is that's just not quite possible

93
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,400
with the current upstream OEM hardware

94
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
provided that they have.

95
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,280
I mean, you can imagine,

96
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,720
we'd see Apple all the time as an example.

97
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,000
Sometimes it's nice to have control of the complete stack

98
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,320
that you're working and building on.

99
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,280
So they seem to have found something here

100
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,260
that is a nice,

101
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,380
actually, I would say this is above and beyond

102
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,520
what you would expect because it's open source,

103
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,980
it's well engineered, it follows best practices,

104
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,400
it's completely open source up on GitHub,

105
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
and it is available in a way

106
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,420
in which you can remove the System76 components

107
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,220
completely, they didn't need to do that.

108
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,440
No, it's like a generically useful open source application.

109
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,720
And it's designed in such a way

110
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,060
that it plugs into GNOME settings,

111
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,480
like it's just part of GNOME settings,

112
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,600
or it can be a standalone GTK application as well.

113
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,780
And the back end is toolkit agnostic,

114
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,840
so if someone wanted to write acute front end,

115
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,160
they could, they would just need to submit the patches.

116
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,960
That's what you mean by well engineered.

117
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,080
It really, it's pretty neat.

118
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,240
So I had a couple of questions.

119
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,860
So I contacted Carl, the CEO of System76,

120
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,920
and I had basically a big picture question

121
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,220
and an implementation detail question.

122
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,080
And I think his email, I'll just read it to you,

123
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,220
he says, so far the coverage has been pretty accurate,

124
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,060
which is great to see,

125
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,680
because I always like to ask when I contact people,

126
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,100
how have you felt the coverage has represented

127
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,540
the accuracy so far?

128
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,080
Because that's a great way to ask them,

129
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,040
like, what are people getting wrong

130
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,200
that you'd like to respond to?

131
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,220
And you get a little insight into their thought process too.

132
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,620
I feel like it's a very revealing question.

133
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,260
And he writes, so far the coverage has been pretty accurate,

134
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,360
and they clarified some of the confusion

135
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,620
about distribution and repackaging,

136
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,960
which was a big part of the question.

137
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,720
But he says, most importantly,

138
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,460
I want to stress that the feature only requires

139
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,440
a small set of standard dependency support

140
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,720
for either firmware from us or LVFS,

141
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,960
which I think is awesome.

142
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,500
And then I asked him about a tweet,

143
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,780
because Carl had tweeted that this was the beginning

144
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,220
of System76 becoming a bigger software player.

145
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,240
And I asked him if he saw a future

146
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,980
where Pop OS could potentially have more users

147
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,720
than they have hardware customers.

148
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,300
And this firmware manager could get adopted

149
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,980
by distros like elementary and others that use GTK,

150
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,220
but don't use GNOME software.

151
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,100
I could see that really taking off actually.

152
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,260
People love Rust is so in right now.

153
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,940
So something built in Rust grabs attention.

154
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,640
It also just means they'll probably be able to ship

155
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,580
an easily installable package, right?

156
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,780
This is going to be available as a modern Linux application

157
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,540
that's easy to get and easy to run.

158
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,220
That's being maintained by an upstream provider

159
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,660
that has business motivations to keep it current.

160
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,540
A reliable, yeah, exactly.

161
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,020
So I asked him, I'm like, there's potential here

162
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,120
where you become just as much of a software shop

163
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,620
as you are a hardware shop.

164
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,980
And his response to that is we create features

165
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,980
with the hope that it's useful,

166
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,140
that everyone can use them,

167
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,440
but they focus on the needs of the customers first.

168
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,900
If the needs overlap with others,

169
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,420
so our work can be valuable to the broader community,

170
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,740
that's kind of great, I think is the implication.

171
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,340
He says, but this is what's special about open source.

172
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,500
There are all these places where the work overlaps

173
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
without conflicting with the ability to create unique

174
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,420
and focused products and solutions.

175
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,860
That is very well said.

176
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,700
It's profound.

177
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,420
Yeah, I mean, we talk about that all the time,

178
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,820
but that kind of just sums it all up.

179
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,100
We can, sure you compete with people,

180
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,820
but most of the time we can all work together.

181
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,060
And then he ends it with for us,

182
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,460
software and hardware are inseparable.

183
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,900
Hardware is the business model that enables us

184
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,140
to invest in the Linux desktop.

185
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,380
I think I've heard that before from somewhere

186
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,700
that's fairly successful.

187
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,580
Right, I mean, it's kind of an established model

188
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,420
in some ways.

189
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,460
I think they're really proud of the work.

190
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,380
I think they're really proud of something.

191
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,860
I think they feel like they've made something really good.

192
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,700
And I think they have.

193
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,700
Yeah, I don't know how easy it is to get at this moment,

194
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,460
but there is a GitHub repo we'll have linked

195
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,180
in the show notes, so you can go build it yourself

196
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,220
if you've got the Rust tool chain.

197
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,700
Yeah, we poked at it a bit and kind of decided not yet.

198
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,260
We'll wait till it's a little easier.

199
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,380
Maybe somebody's packaged it up a little bit easier

200
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,780
outside of Pop OS.

201
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,300
But we will have a link to the GitHub

202
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,500
with all of the details if you are curious.

203
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,060
But speaking of doing a great job,

204
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,100
the chairman for OpenSUSE has stepped down.

205
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,300
Richard Brown is leaving the project

206
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,980
and he's handing it over to another member of SUSE.

207
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,420
Richard will continue to work for SUSE as a developer,

208
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,660
but he will no longer be the chairman of OpenSUSE.

209
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,860
It's pretty big community news for OpenSUSE.

210
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,420
Yeah, passing the torch on to the next leader.

211
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,100
It seems like it would be sort of obvious.

212
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,980
The elephant in the room, if you will, if I didn't mention

213
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,460
the fact that they're working

214
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,780
on further independence from SUSE.

215
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,980
They're working on this new council

216
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,060
that we talked about before on the show.

217
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,460
He says in his changing of the guard post

218
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,260
that that's not a factor here.

219
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,860
And I just wonder what the root of this story is

220
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,100
because Richard didn't really share it.

221
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,820
So it leaves some to the imagination,

222
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,620
but I think he leaves a good legacy.

223
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,820
Five years, he was a passionate chairman.

224
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,660
Oh, very passionate.

225
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,060
I mean, I think did a good job

226
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,340
of trying to espouse the benefits of running OpenSUSE.

227
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,500
Good luck to whatever next endeavors he takes on.

228
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,580
We'll see what comes on next.

229
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,420
We'll see what other stories develop.

230
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,380
And of course, keep an eye on OpenSUSE in general,

231
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,060
just like we keep an eye on Fedora.

232
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,780
We have an update for Fedora 31.

233
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,940
It looks like the month old proposal

234
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,980
for the upcoming Fedora 31 Linux distribution

235
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,060
to release, to stop, I should say,

236
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,780
releasing the I-686 repositories for everything

237
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,540
and modules was voted on today by the Fedora engineering

238
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,780
and the steering committee.

239
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,860
Say that again, Chris?

240
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,900
No, I'll say it.

241
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,180
Yeah, it's a little- The Vesco Group

242
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,420
gave their formal approval today

243
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,340
for permitting these I-686 repositories

244
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,580
to be removed beginning with Fedora 31.

245
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,980
This also goes hand in step with Fedora 31

246
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,260
having already decided to stop I-686 kernel builds.

247
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,780
Mm, this is doom.

248
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,700
Obviously, all games are ruined.

249
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,500
This is gonna destroy wine on the Linux desktop.

250
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,140
And it was just about to be the year of the Linux desktop.

251
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,980
We're screwing it up.

252
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,860
I know, I can't believe it.

253
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,700
Right, Drew?

254
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,820
It's all- No, no, no.

255
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,660
Hold your horses.

256
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,500
What?

257
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,340
Oh, I was getting so worked up though.

258
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,260
Multi-lib is not going anywhere.

259
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,660
This is just to drop direct I-686 builds.

260
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,500
So they're not going to be releasing an x86 kernel.

261
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,180
They're not gonna have an x86 release,

262
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,780
but they are continuing all of the multi-lib work.

263
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,700
So if you're running 64-bit, which after 30, with 31,

264
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,620
you definitely will be running 64-bit.

265
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,620
You can still run everything that was in the 32-bit.

266
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,060
You're just doing it through multi-lib.

267
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,780
That's such a good clarification, Drew,

268
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,380
because I mean, it's kind of just recognizing

269
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,460
what we're all already doing.

270
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,220
Yes, I need to run some 32-bit applications,

271
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,020
but I want to run a 64-bit system.

272
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,780
Yeah, I know, that's perfect.

273
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,340
I just don't know what I'm gonna do with this pitchfork now.

274
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,860
Dang it, I got it all polished up.

275
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,420
You know, I got the flames, put the kerosene,

276
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,460
whatever it is on there, so it would burn real nice.

277
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,620
You know, I put a lot of effort into that.

278
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,980
Oh, I think you'll find something.

279
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,580
I was up all night working on that.

280
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,220
Well, you know what?

281
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,500
I was wondering why it took so long.

282
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Why did it take a month for them to decide?

283
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,620
Was it like super hard?

284
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,220
Did they deliberate like just constantly?

285
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,660
No, no, it's just the way time you worked out,

286
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,660
you had flock and you had to punt at once

287
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,220
and there was just a lot going on.

288
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,180
I mean, it's worth considering too, you know.

289
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,100
You don't want to have to take it back.

290
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,580
It is worth considering, yeah, it would be.

291
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,140
Well, you know, I bet, just like with the Ubuntu thing,

292
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,140
if there was some situation where things got a little weird,

293
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,780
something tells me a container or a flat pack

294
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,580
would probably solve the problem.

295
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,620
Put it all in a flat pack, that's what I always say, Wes.

296
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,380
Just put it all in a flat pack.

297
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,260
Now we have a new feed, a new content we're exploring,

298
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,460
minimum viable podcasts, if you will,

299
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,620
fun extras that maybe didn't fit in the show,

300
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,980
an extended interview or, for example, today,

301
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,500
Chris and Wes react to old clips of Linux unplugged,

302
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,340
it's brutal.

303
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,420
Oh, so bad.

304
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,820
We have new content, extras.show

305
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,180
and subscribe at extras.show slash subscribe.

306
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,860
It's the Jupiter Extras, the Jupiter Extras.

307
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,540
I mean, if you're at all curious,

308
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,780
I'd say just, you know, just subscribe, why not?

309
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,660
We're kind of excited about it and have all kinds of ideas

310
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,420
about stuff we're going to put there, so give it a try.

311
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,620
As they say in the biz,

312
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,420
we have a pipeline full of content

313
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,380
already queued up and ready to go.

314
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,100
Stay a while and listen.

315
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,580
Yeah, so extras.show, irregular,

316
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,380
extra content that we're having fun with.

317
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,340
We ended the Friday stream.

318
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,780
We'll be doing more live stream community events.

319
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,300
I don't know if we want to say anything yet, Cheesy.

320
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,140
Should we just hold on?

321
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,420
I don't want to spoil anything, but we got more coming.

322
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,740
Yeah, I don't want to spoil anything either,

323
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,260
but there is some stuff coming around the pike

324
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,340
and I think it's going to be good.

325
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,500
I think it's going to be bigger than the Friday stream was

326
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,580
in a lot of respects.

327
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,140
And with extras, it gives us definitely a platform

328
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,580
to try a lot of things and places to put stuff

329
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,500
that we really didn't have a place before.

330
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,620
So, you know, with a lot of these interviews and stuff,

331
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,620
you can only put so much into the show

332
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,540
without it being too campy almost.

333
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,220
So this gives, you know, that person

334
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,300
that was being interviewed an opportunity

335
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,460
to have the full interview aired.

336
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,940
And I think it gives the listeners something extra.

337
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,580
Extras, you might say.

338
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,660
It's been fun.

339
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,900
It was something that we were considering

340
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,740
during our recent sprint.

341
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,620
Everybody got together and it just like took off.

342
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,780
It took off in a big way.

343
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,900
The first thing we published

344
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,700
was the full Thomas Cameron Linux Fest keynote.

345
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,180
Then the Choose Linux crew got together

346
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,340
for the first time in studio

347
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,660
and recorded Elle's trip to Hacker Summer Camp experience.

348
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,300
Oh man, there's a lot in there.

349
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,380
And then this morning, we published you and I reacting

350
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,340
to old clips of Linux unplugged.

351
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,180
And tomorrow morning, there will be some breaking news

352
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,660
that doesn't fit in anywhere else.

353
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,740
So it'll be in the feed.

354
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,940
Oh yeah, stay tuned.

355
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,980
So go over to extras.show and subscribe.

356
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,220
It's just a little things here and there,

357
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,780
just fun extra stuff.

358
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,460
And we'll have, like I said,

359
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,460
a whole pipeline of content coming soon.

360
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,860
And I'm really happy with the way

361
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,940
the React series turned out.

362
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,780
We might do it.

363
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,420
We might turn it into a series.

364
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,260
Oh, I hope so.

365
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,500
We'll see what people say.

366
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,180
Extras.show, go check it out.

367
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,020
Now, with all of that said,

368
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,060
we should probably talk about

369
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,380
why we're gathered here today.

370
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,620
I spent the weekend on Wayland.

371
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,540
Who's Drew's fault?

372
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,380
We'll get to that.

373
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,220
Oh yeah.

374
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,460
And it meant going gnome shell for a bit.

375
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,580
And then it meant learning how to live with Wayland.

376
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,140
And I've got some observations.

377
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,980
I've got some tools, some tips, some tricks,

378
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,020
and we'll do a little kind of recap

379
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,980
of where Wayland support is at

380
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,180
and why it's taken so long.

381
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,020
So first,

382
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,260
a little of that old housekeeping.

383
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,580
I have to give a shout out

384
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,460
to the Linux Academy YouTube channel.

385
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,460
They've posted two really great tutorials recently,

386
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,100
Scanning Your Network for Vulnerabilities with Nmap.

387
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,900
It's eight minutes long.

388
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,380
It's a great tutorial.

389
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,620
Oh man, what distro is that?

390
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,500
Oh, that's Kali, of course.

391
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,660
That must be Kali.

392
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,820
Yeah, so using Kali in there.

393
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,260
And then there's another video

394
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,140
that was posted just a couple of days ago,

395
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,380
how to copy directories around your network

396
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,300
with SCP recursively.

397
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,700
Three minutes and 49 seconds.

398
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,260
So really quick videos, youtube.com slash linuxacademy.com.

399
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,420
Go check those out.

400
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,820
And then they're continuing to post

401
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,500
longer in-depth tutorials on the Linux Academy blog,

402
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
linuxacademy.com slash blog.

403
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,860
Good additional content that often complements

404
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,700
what we're covering in these shows.

405
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,620
Well, yeah, it really does.

406
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,260
So go check that out.

407
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,260
It's youtube.com slash linuxacademy.com

408
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,420
for the YouTube channel,

409
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,820
and linuxacademy.com slash blog.

410
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,100
For that blog.

411
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,780
There's a lot going on with Wayland, guys.

412
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,300
There's a lot going on with Wayland.

413
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,820
It's been a while since we talked about it.

414
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,780
I feel like some distributions,

415
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,580
some people started running it by default

416
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,260
with Gnome, for example.

417
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,100
Yep, yep.

418
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,820
And then we didn't hear anything else.

419
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,060
Is it just going well?

420
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,540
Is no one using it?

421
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,380
We haven't talked about it.

422
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,860
It's almost become a meme, really.

423
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,300
Like, when is it going to ship fully?

424
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,460
Like, everywhere.

425
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,980
Wayland begun in 2008.

426
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,060
Version 1.0 was released in October of 2012.

427
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,900
Wow.

428
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,100
So it's been a few years since this project started

429
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,060
as we record this here episode.

430
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,460
And if you look back at the history,

431
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,220
like the announcements of Wayland,

432
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,940
it wasn't described as the X11 killer.

433
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,180
In fact, it was kind of downplayed

434
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,780
as a tiny display server that might be good

435
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,140
for embedded media devices that, like, are doing displays.

436
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,260
Or maybe this might be the display server that GDM uses.

437
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,100
You'd still use X for your desktop,

438
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,420
but GDM would use this Wayland thing

439
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,980
because they were concerned about the overhead of GDM.

440
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,980
And that's the initial launch intention behind it.

441
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,300
But that started to shift.

442
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,220
Almost, if you look at the history of things,

443
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,700
and we have some links in the show notes,

444
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,540
about six months after Wayland's release,

445
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,020
everything kind of shifts.

446
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,860
You got to figure, like, people were looking for something.

447
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,340
And even the project begins to describe itself

448
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,180
as a simpler replacement for X.

449
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,820
I mean, this was kind of inevitable, right?

450
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,700
X is so old.

451
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,660
It first came out in 1984.

452
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,540
OK, all right.

453
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,100
I mean, we do computing a little bit differently these days.

454
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,100
And I mean, even just like in, say, 2013,

455
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,820
there were already a ton of issues,

456
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,260
and it was showing its age.

457
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,660
I mean, some of these are from the core protocol.

458
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,020
But also, most modern X servers run 23 of the 27

459
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,740
possible X extensions.

460
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,580
Yeah, this extension thing is like spaghetti.

461
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,340
Yeah.

462
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,700
And the policy is basically always

463
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,900
preserve backwards compatibility.

464
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,460
And so X.org, the main implementation

465
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,700
we're all using of X, it has four different input models,

466
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,940
four display models, and two rendering models,

467
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,180
despite the fact that many of those are actually obsolete.

468
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,620
So they were probably needed at some point in history.

469
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:42,860
Yeah.

470
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,020
And one thing, we kind of talk about what

471
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,340
happens for us as the end user.

472
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,180
And that's important.

473
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,580
But we should think, too, this is an open source project.

474
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,980
There's developers here who are putting time and energy.

475
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,420
And one of the developers describes it

476
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,060
as we've kicked that can as far down the road as we can.

477
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,100
And that's it, right?

478
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,780
If it's hard to work on, that's going to be security problems.

479
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,260
And that's just going to make it so no one wants to contribute.

480
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,100
Yeah.

481
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,460
I recently saw a developer post by the Fedora developers

482
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,180
who are some of the primary developers on Wayland

483
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,740
and, by contrast, also the maintainers for X.org.

484
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,300
And in the blog post, they write very clear, clear as day.

485
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,100
We now consider X.org in maintenance mode.

486
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,300
We are shutting it down.

487
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,700
We are transitioning off.

488
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,940
Wayland is the future, which kind of got this idea in my head.

489
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,180
So when Drew came along and was trying this, I was like, hmm.

490
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,740
That Fedora pusher, Drew.

491
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,700
But how did we get here?

492
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,300
Because initially, the core idea of Wayland

493
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,180
was to be something very simple and something very clean

494
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,700
and small.

495
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,660
And how's it going to replace something

496
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,140
as massive and sort of edge case accommodating as X?

497
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,700
Yeah.

498
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,100
I mean, can it?

499
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,620
Will it?

500
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,140
Will it?

501
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,140
And I think a lot of the concerns we've had have been,

502
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,340
how do we fill all the tiny little gaps, right?

503
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,060
We got pretty early with Wayland,

504
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,480
just basic rendering and compositing sort of stuff.

505
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,100
That's easy.

506
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,620
But making all the little details,

507
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,580
being able to capture windows, having security,

508
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,140
being able to have hotkeys around,

509
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,780
let's not get started about remote desktop connections.

510
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,700
All of those are little extras not used by everyone,

511
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,220
but are crucial to many workflows.

512
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,380
One of my biggest documented fears right here in the show

513
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,700
is some of those things are getting implemented differently

514
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,280
by different projects.

515
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,900
And so I raised that concern about a year and a half ago.

516
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,740
And so I thought this would be a good check-in

517
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,380
to see, how is that really playing out?

518
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,140
Is it really been that bad?

519
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,180
I thought that'd be also a note.

520
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,860
So there's been a few things, a few observations.

521
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,760
So Drew, you were here as part of the overall sprint.

522
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,900
And you run Gnome Shell, Fedora, Wayland on your ThinkPad T480.

523
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,460
And I was watching you and how smooth it was.

524
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,700
But there was one moment, I think, that I think you got me.

525
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,900
It was really a small thing.

526
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,020
It was like the straw that broke the camel's back.

527
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,300
Well, and what's funny is it has very little

528
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,340
to do with Wayland, the thing that caused you to switch.

529
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,180
Absolutely.

530
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,740
It was, I went to show you something on my computer.

531
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,400
And you saw my browser.

532
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,540
And you were about to epiphany shame me.

533
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,940
Screen peeker.

534
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,260
And I said, no, no, no, that's Firefox.

535
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,940
And it's just a CSS theme on top of Firefox.

536
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,420
And oh, by the way, Firefox is Wayland native now on Fedora.

537
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,060
And that seemed to be the thing that kicked it

538
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,460
into high gear for you of, OK, well, let's go ahead

539
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,860
and do this now.

540
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,740
I was just seeing, one, how good Firefox could look.

541
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,820
And two, that, oh, wow, browsers are starting to support it.

542
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,320
Yeah.

543
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,860
Maybe it's getting there.

544
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,420
There's something about Firefox having native Wayland support

545
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:54,020
and being smooth as silk on your desktop and looking.

546
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,500
So when I was epiphany shaming, it sort of says two things.

547
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,340
It says, wow, epiphany is great looking.

548
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,300
And then it also says it's not good enough, right?

549
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,800
But the fact that you've got Firefox

550
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,180
to look as good as epiphany.

551
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,340
Oh, we were both impressed.

552
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,140
It was just like, uh.

553
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,940
And it was smooth.

554
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,780
What?

555
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,820
It's kind of an open source testament, right?

556
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,140
Like, we can have it this good.

557
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,300
Yeah, we'll have a link to that theme in the show notes,

558
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:15,780
by the way.

559
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,100
Don't you worry.

560
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,100
And to get that browser meant I needed to be on Gnome Shell,

561
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,300
because that was a theme to look good on Gnome Shell.

562
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,020
And you needed client-side decorations

563
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,500
and all of that jazz.

564
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,220
And I had this niggling desire to try Wayland

565
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,440
in the back of my mind anyways.

566
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,500
So this was the moment.

567
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,340
I just took my ThinkPad with XFCE installed on it.

568
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,780
And I did a dnf group install gnome-desktop.

569
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,020
That's all it takes.

570
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,300
That's all it takes.

571
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,780
And then everything.

572
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:50,340
Oh, I also, using systemctl, disabled LightDM

573
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,940
and enabled GDM.

574
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,980
So then I also got a hot tip from Drew

575
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,620
to enable a certain copper repo.

576
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,340
Yes.

577
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,140
So there is a copper repo out there.

578
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,740
It's called gnome-with-patches.

579
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,780
And it's exactly what it sounds like.

580
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,660
All of those performance patches that

581
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,900
have been trickling in from other distros, some of them

582
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,060
from Canonical, some of them direct from the Gnome project,

583
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,700
but they're not yet in the stable repos for Fedora.

584
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,660
Those have all been kind of consolidated

585
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,980
into this one repo.

586
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,140
And it is technically experimental,

587
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,420
but it is great.

588
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,460
The performance in Gnome Shell is so much better

589
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,460
using this repo for me, personally,

590
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,260
that I'm using it on both a Radeon build on my desktop

591
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,380
and on my laptop.

592
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,900
And there is also experimental support

593
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,220
for enabling the real-time support that is coming in.

594
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,220
I think it's coming in 3.33.

595
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,300
But it's not there in 3.32 yet, but you can get it here.

596
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,380
And you do have to enable a setting through,

597
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
is it deconf or gconf?

598
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,460
Gconf, yeah.

599
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,220
Yeah, through one of those to get that support.

600
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,900
So when you say performance improvements,

601
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,540
what perceptively is noticeable?

602
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,380
It's just silky smooth, everything

603
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,540
from moving windows around, windows launching, scrolling

604
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,860
between your virtual desktops.

605
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,940
All of it feels almost as fast as XFCE,

606
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,860
but definitely smoother because you've

607
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,400
got those animations going on at the same time.

608
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,020
So I think that's where I wanted to start my Wayland observations

609
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,060
at right here, is I have felt like everything

610
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,380
has felt smoother on Wayland.

611
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,620
So you're saying it's even smoother with these patches?

612
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,380
Yes.

613
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,020
How smooth can you get, man?

614
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,020
Eventually, I'm going to slip off my computer.

615
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,260
Well, that makes sense, right?

616
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,580
Because if we're just talking about a protocol here,

617
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,660
then the protocol enables that smoothness.

618
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,980
And now we're seeing some of the implementation details.

619
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,540
The refinement.

620
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,700
Yeah, exactly.

621
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,460
Makes sense.

622
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,020
So that's a good way to break it down, Mr. Payne.

623
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,860
I definitely would say, though, my number one

624
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,900
with a bullet observation is Gnome Shell, so far, very smooth.

625
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,740
I'll tell you a couple of things that I think

626
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,140
are necessary to get there.

627
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,340
But everything's smooth.

628
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,120
Firefox is smooth.

629
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,100
Scrolling the settings is smooth.

630
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,020
It's ridiculous.

631
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,200
You're just sitting there scrolling all day,

632
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,280
not getting any work done.

633
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,220
I'm telling you, man, it's like I'm having an ASMR experience,

634
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,220
but there's no audio.

635
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,940
It's just so great.

636
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,380
So that has been my big preferred change.

637
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,180
I really like that.

638
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,620
Now, here's what I haven't liked.

639
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,580
Here's my dislike change.

640
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,320
And that is, surprise, now this is likely the entire stack,

641
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,780
not just Wayland, but it wakes up way slower than XFCE.

642
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,300
XFCE, man, I cracked that lid open,

643
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,100
and it literally wakes so fast that it's

644
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,100
open before I can see the light on the screen.

645
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,420
I mean, it's awake before I can see the light on the screen.

646
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,340
And it's so fast that I question if it was sleeping at all.

647
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,580
Did you actually check that?

648
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,180
Because that would be probably.

649
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,060
I do now.

650
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,180
I do, because it wakes so fast.

651
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,320
I'm like, one of these times it's not going to be sleeping.

652
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,740
So I always look to see if that little red IBM light is

653
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,100
pulsing right now.

654
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,580
It's that fast.

655
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,420
Now that I'm on the Wayland stack with GDM,

656
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,340
and then on Michelle Locker and all that,

657
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,520
I open up the old lid, and 1, 1,000, 2, 1,000,

658
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,220
screen wakes up.

659
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,780
I do the old space bar, log in with my password, hit Enter,

660
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,080
1, 1,000, 2, 1,000 at the desktop.

661
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,900
It's just not that perfect, faster than a MacBook

662
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,220
experience, which XFCE got me.

663
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,620
But all the other experiences of using the desktop

664
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,820
feel very smooth.

665
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,820
And having been away from UI effects for a long time,

666
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,620
and now being back on a desktop that implements them,

667
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,420
but I'd say in a nice way, in a clean way,

668
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,340
it's not over the top.

669
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,700
My windows aren't exploding.

670
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,540
Hey, hey now.

671
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,460
I like that.

672
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,220
But it's very smooth.

673
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,100
It's probably the smoothest I've ever seen it.

674
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,680
Now, I'm going to give it a little bit.

675
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,540
I'm not switching off XFCE.

676
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,180
See, I'm wondering if your experience in,

677
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,180
that's why we got XFCE in the studios, which I agree with

678
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,660
and is appropriate.

679
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,700
But there is a little smoothness, a little butter.

680
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,860
You miss, right?

681
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,460
Like a little just makes it sort of feel special and modern

682
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,060
and snappy.

683
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,860
This is something I was trying to work out with Brent off-mic.

684
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,120
And I was just trying to get his input,

685
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,340
because what I was saying to you was,

686
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,260
it feels like I'm compelled to use something

687
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,040
that I can't quantify in numbers.

688
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,860
It's just simply how it makes me feel when I use the computer.

689
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,100
And I struggle to assign a value to that.

690
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,020
Well, there's something about the user experience

691
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,140
that is so much richer when you can actually

692
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,140
enjoy every single aspect of it, right?

693
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,340
When it just kind of feels good in your bones

694
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,820
when you're using it.

695
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,980
If I don't enjoy using my tools, it

696
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,020
does seem like it's a creative blocker for me.

697
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,980
Like, if I'm frustrated with the experience,

698
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,820
you may have witnessed it recently.

699
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,060
I was doing a quick edit clip, and I busted out.

700
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,300
All the computers are in use.

701
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,420
We have a MacBook here, so I busted it out.

702
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,380
And I haven't used Mac OS in so long

703
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,660
that I became really frustrated with the UI,

704
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,940
like the way the trackpad worked, which I used to love

705
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,980
the trackpad.

706
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,860
I became frustrated with the way that even selecting windows

707
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,020
and resizing them.

708
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,740
I mean, it was like the experience was so awful.

709
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,340
I don't think I'll ever do it again.

710
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,580
It really made trying to do something

711
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,940
quick and creative a very frustrating experience.

712
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,980
You were on the edge of a nerd rage, for sure.

713
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,180
Yeah, Alex, you saw it, too.

714
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,100
You saw when I was really having a hard time with the Mac,

715
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,060
and it was like, I'm just not used to having

716
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,020
to fight my tools like this.

717
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,580
And if I don't enjoy using the machine,

718
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,460
I kind of burn out on the work.

719
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,580
Once I got the clip good enough, I was like, oh, screw it, man.

720
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,380
This took way too much work.

721
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,260
I'm done.

722
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,340
I was spent at that.

723
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,740
What kind of maniac am I?

724
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,060
What does that mean about me?

725
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,060
What does that say?

726
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,300
What's wrong with me?

727
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,340
Because you don't have this problem.

728
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,860
Your windows are exploding like a maniac.

729
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,540
You don't care.

730
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,260
No, I don't mind at all.

731
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,260
You can have a crack on your screen.

732
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,300
It doesn't drive you crazy.

733
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,580
If I have a crack on my smart screen,

734
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,220
I don't go to the AT&T store or whatever I got to go to go,

735
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,660
or the Apple store or whatever I got to drag my ass into.

736
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,420
I don't do that.

737
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,340
I don't do that.

738
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,100
But if my screen is cracked, I'm going

739
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,780
into that store like that day.

740
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:15,900
So sometimes you just got to be a little resilient.

741
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,820
It does help if you don't taste some of the other stuff.

742
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,980
You were on XF.

743
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,060
Now you're experienced.

744
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,580
I kind of just assume it takes a little bit

745
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,540
to wake up from sleep.

746
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,820
So that sounds normal.

747
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,340
That sounds normal to me.

748
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,540
I feel like I can't go back either.

749
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,460
That's the problem.

750
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,620
I mean, it's the same with proprietary stuff.

751
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,860
If you just try the open source solution and you make it work,

752
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,380
it's great.

753
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:36,860
It's fine.

754
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,180
And sometimes you try the proprietary,

755
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,340
and you're like, now I see the flaws.

756
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,140
Which is useful and good, and we should try to aim there.

757
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,620
But it's kind of a mental thing.

758
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,380
Another way to put that is I'd probably

759
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,900
think Lightworks or Acadian Live could do everything I ever

760
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,740
needed to do.

761
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,360
And anyone who said anything differently

762
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,940
was a dope if I had never used Final Cut.

763
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,820
Or I'd never used Premiere.

764
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,180
But I got access to those first.

765
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,580
And so the other tools to me just never really satisfied me.

766
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,620
Exactly.

767
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,020
But I'm sort of trapped here, because I find the overall

768
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,820
experience to be very pleasant.

769
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,140
My laptop runs cooler.

770
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,820
I don't have a solid read yet, but I'm

771
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,900
getting comparable-ish battery life to XFCE,

772
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,940
which if I even get in the ballpark of XFCE's battery

773
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,220
life, that's a breakthrough for Gnome Shell.

774
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,460
That's a breakthrough.

775
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,180
Now I'm on the ThinkPad T480 using the Intel GPU,

776
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,980
so I'm best case scenario.

777
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,180
So what is the state?

778
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,420
What is the state of Wayland?

779
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,020
Like, do you need to be on very specific hardware?

780
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,940
Sort of.

781
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,620
Now the Ryzen graphics stack is open source,

782
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,740
and the Intel graphics stack is open source.

783
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,940
You have a lot more options.

784
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,180
You can get some good desktops.

785
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,260
Drew, you said there's been some downsides, though,

786
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,340
on your Ryzen system.

787
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,420
Yeah, but it's edge cases.

788
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,500
Describe the system.

789
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Is it AMD graphics?

790
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,460
Is it a Ryzen CPU?

791
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,980
Like, is it an Intel system?

792
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,060
What is the hardware you're having issues with?

793
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,860
So I have a Ryzen processor, Gen 1.

794
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:04,380
And I've got a Radeon RX 580, as well as a Radeon RX 480.

795
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,100
But that one's just for pass-through.

796
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,340
So the 580 is really the one that's happening,

797
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,340
doing all of my Linux graphics processing.

798
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,740
And it runs great.

799
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,380
Wayland behaves normally under most circumstances.

800
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,420
But I do have a rotated monitor.

801
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,020
And that's where I get one of these little tiny edge cases

802
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,260
where, every now and then, I'll get a cursor stuck,

803
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,300
rotated back the other way, up in the corner.

804
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,820
And it just stays there.

805
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,340
And a lot of times, I could ignore it.

806
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,700
But like you, Chris, sometimes you look at it, and you see it,

807
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,060
and you just get angrier and angrier.

808
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,660
The good news is that particular bug,

809
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,420
along with other paper cut bugs, if we want to call them that,

810
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,620
are on a list that are actively being worked at

811
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:02,500
by the Wayland people to get those little paper cuts that

812
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,260
are kind of blocking mass adoption to just wipe those out

813
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,580
and get it working correctly for everybody all the time.

814
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,740
That's it.

815
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,700
Wayland is now at a point where there's some paper cuts.

816
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,220
There's some paper cuts, but you can get your job done.

817
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,820
And there's also appreciable benefits to using it now.

818
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,740
Drew, you've even done some No Man's Sky under Proton

819
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,940
on Wayland, correct?

820
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,660
Yeah, also on an Intel GPU.

821
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,060
That part's ridiculous.

822
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,460
I mean, X-Wayland is so, so smooth.

823
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,940
I have no idea what is a Wayland application

824
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,700
and what is an X-Wayland application.

825
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,940
I cannot tell you the difference at this point.

826
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,380
It's nice not having to know, right?

827
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,860
You just sort of use Windows.

828
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,980
You've been on it longer than I have, though, Drew.

829
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,140
Is there some standout identifiers?

830
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,380
Can you tell when something's an X-Wayland application?

831
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,820
Only when the application itself is kind of buggy to begin with.

832
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,580
And it can kind of show its cracks.

833
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,780
Like Reaper, as great as it is, for example.

834
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,500
And this is proprietary software running its own toolkit on Linux.

835
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,940
But a great audio editor.

836
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,260
A great audio editor.

837
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,140
I love it to death.

838
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,500
But every now and then, it can kind of

839
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,940
show some cracks where it's just not quite as good.

840
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,940
And I get more graphical glitches with Reaper

841
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,740
under Wayland than I do under X. But to be fair,

842
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:28,180
they're still very minor and are not breaking my workflow.

843
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,820
Just when I resize a window or something like that,

844
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,820
you can just kind of see the cracks at the edge.

845
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,020
But that's about it these days.

846
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,980
Other than that, no, I can't really tell.

847
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,180
Now, if you, like me, have grown to depend on a few core desktop

848
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,540
Linux applications, it is useful to have a Wayland buddy

849
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,420
when you switch.

850
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,860
Drew, you are my Wayland buddy.

851
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,900
And you helped me replace a few of my key go-to Linux desktop

852
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:57,060
applications with ones that do work better under Wayland,

853
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:02,580
starting with my favorite beloved built-in screenshot

854
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,900
tool to XFCE.

855
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,020
I had to get something better, something more modern.

856
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,660
And you pointed me to Flameshot.

857
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,380
Yes.

858
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,100
So I came across Flameshot when I first

859
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,580
started playing around with Wayland maybe a year ago

860
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,820
and discovered that Shudder does not work in Wayland.

861
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,300
And I had to find something to replace that

862
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,900
and came across Flameshot.

863
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,260
And it's just a great little screenshot tool.

864
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,340
Works very, very well in Wayland and also in Xorg.

865
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,980
So if you're still on Xorg, you're not missing out here.

866
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,060
You can still use it.

867
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,820
But it's great.

868
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,660
And I just rebound my Print Screen button for it.

869
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,060
And now, anytime I have to print anything,

870
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,180
I can do it with Flameshot where I

871
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,180
can draw a particular size of the screenshot.

872
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,980
I can copy it to a clipboard, publish it to Imgur,

873
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,900
any number of things.

874
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,780
It's just got support for all of this built-in

875
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,780
and a really slick interface.

876
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,060
It is really good, really good.

877
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,420
That was a solid recommendation.

878
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,940
And then there was the moment I struggled with the most.

879
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,860
I even considered some crazy hacks that

880
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,820
were offered by the project.

881
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,660
Side note, one of the project's workarounds

882
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,340
I'm about to mention was log out of your desktop,

883
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,620
choose the X11 desktop, and log back in.

884
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,780
I'm like, what kind of fix is that?

885
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,780
Yes, you still get that sometimes.

886
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:26,260
But my beloved ULauncher is usable, for sure, on Wayland.

887
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:29,420
But it is not a native Wayland application.

888
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,780
And one of the big disadvantages is applications in the past

889
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,100
where you'd set a hotkey for kind of don't work great

890
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,980
on Wayland.

891
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,860
It doesn't really let just any application

892
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,500
grab any old key input.

893
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,220
Which, I mean, that is nice.

894
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,220
And you can solve this by using the GNOME shell settings

895
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,140
to do key bindings.

896
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,820
Because that's at the shell level, and that does work.

897
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,940
And you, in the case of ULauncher,

898
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,180
had to load a couple of other things.

899
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,900
And I looked at all of my options.

900
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,060
Drew convinced me, drop ULauncher, which was rough.

901
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,820
You know that GNOME Shell has a.

902
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,700
And he was the built-in GNOME Shell launcher.

903
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,500
And there's a bigger philosophy there, Drew.

904
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,100
Yeah, well, use the tools that you're given.

905
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,020
And in this particular case, the GNOME Shell launcher

906
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,220
already does most of the things that ULauncher can do.

907
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,580
And you don't need to add extra stuff on top.

908
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,940
It's just like with extensions.

909
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,500
The more you pile on, the more chances

910
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,980
you're giving your desktop to misbehave.

911
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,940
So by trying to decide, OK, what's

912
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,500
the smallest number of extensions that I really need?

913
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,060
And granted, ULauncher is not an extension.

914
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,060
But I'm going to kind of lump it in with those.

915
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,540
No, I follow you.

916
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:48,620
By stripping those out, you can get down to a base that

917
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,720
is still very workable.

918
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,140
And still, maybe you have to kind of relearn the direction

919
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,660
you go for one particular thing.

920
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,500
But overall, you can still do everything

921
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,780
that you need to do, just in a slightly different way

922
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,100
and a much more stable and fluid desktop.

923
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,420
That's what I've found with Wayland and GNOME

924
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,700
in most recent builds.

925
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,500
I think you nailed the trade-off there.

926
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,060
If you're willing to go a different path

927
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,140
to get that task done, you're rewarded

928
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,860
with stability, smoothness, and a modern workflow.

929
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,380
Some compromises may be necessary.

930
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,020
And I mean, maybe you can put some pressure,

931
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,580
file some bugs, and improve the tools

932
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,420
that you have that start out really nice

933
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,580
and just need to grow a few new features.

934
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,940
Well, you've got to have a certain momentum of users

935
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,260
using Wayland to make it worth developer time.

936
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,740
Yeah, absolutely.

937
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,740
And we all just do weird stuff, too, right?

938
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,260
I mean, there's no way to figure out

939
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,940
how it doesn't work until you've run into it.

940
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,420
Oh, yeah.

941
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,180
Everybody's got their own workflow.

942
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,500
So yeah, I also am subscribing to the philosophy

943
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,780
of minimal extensions.

944
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,500
In fact, I think I've pared it down now to only three.

945
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,020
The hardest one since day one of using Gnome Shell,

946
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:05,780
well, since 3.12, that's like when Gnome Shell 3.12 launched,

947
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,980
I just see it as a new point.

948
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,900
It was like a new turning point in Gnome Shell.

949
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,940
That's when I really became.

950
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,580
Gnome Shell timeline, because there

951
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:16,220
was some stuff in the early 20 series that was also huge.

952
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,220
And there's some huge stuff in these reviews.

953
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,100
Right now, yeah.

954
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,940
And so it's also why it's kind of fun to check it out,

955
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,740
to not just totally dismiss the project

956
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,940
and see what they're doing.

957
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,100
Because they're kind of an important desktop.

958
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,260
So I kind of feel like it's my responsibility.

959
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,140
Well, and even if you don't like whatever they're exploring,

960
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,860
you can't deny that they are exploring a different way

961
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,140
of doing a desktop, right?

962
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,560
So I gave up the old dock, which I've

963
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,700
used Dash to Docker canonicals implementation to,

964
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,660
which is great.

965
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,140
I've used it on every Gnome Shell install

966
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,540
I've had since Gnome 3.12.

967
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,180
And that was the hardest one to give up,

968
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,900
because I've always used that one.

969
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,140
But Drew convinced me.

970
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,860
And I've pared it down to three extensions.

971
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,180
And I want to give you one of them.

972
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,740
I think it's really important.

973
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,660
It's made Gnome Shell more on par with Plasma for me.

974
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,180
One of the key things I love about Plasma desktop

975
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,380
is those fricking KWIN rules.

976
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,620
Once you learn to embrace KWIN rules,

977
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,120
your workflow changes forever, girl.

978
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,780
Let me tell you.

979
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,340
It is.

980
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,780
It's great.

981
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,820
You showed me the way, yeah.

982
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,540
Yeah, it's great.

983
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,580
I mean, we use it here in the studio for a lot

984
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,620
because some of our applications open up like 12 windows.

985
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:27,300
And there's nothing quite like it in Gnome Shell or in XFCE.

986
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,460
Now, in Gnome Shell, you could replicate the functionality

987
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,020
with two extensions, minimum workspaces,

988
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,660
and then another one where you'd say whenever this application

989
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,620
opens up, you always put it on this screen.

990
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,540
Ah, yes.

991
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,340
Minimum workspaces and that other extension,

992
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,660
they don't work under Wayland.

993
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,380
Of course not.

994
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,140
Not all Gnome Shell extensions work under Wayland.

995
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,980
I have discovered.

996
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,420
Well, it wouldn't be so easy, Chris.

997
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,020
This also encouraged me paring it down

998
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,340
to like three extensions, I'll add.

999
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,900
So I want to mention Auto Move Windows.

1000
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,960
This is not perfect.

1001
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,700
It won't recognize all Windows types.

1002
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,300
But it recognizes the couple that I need, Telegram, Slack,

1003
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,500
Chrome, Firefox, Thunderbird, that kind of stuff.

1004
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,100
It will, when they open, automatically move them

1005
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,540
to a workspace that you designate.

1006
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,020
It's so beautiful.

1007
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,860
So if I click a link when I'm like in Telegram chatting

1008
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,100
with Wes Payne and he sends me a link to something fancy

1009
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,220
and I want to click it, as you do.

1010
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,020
Of course you do.

1011
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,300
I send great links.

1012
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,860
The best.

1013
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,820
And I click that link, it always opens up

1014
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,460
the browser in that workspace.

1015
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,580
It's messy, you know?

1016
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,500
So no, I move that.

1017
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,700
Oh, you want that move.

1018
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,660
I move it.

1019
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,220
I move it with this Auto Move Window.

1020
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,660
It moves it to the workspace I designate for Firefox.

1021
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,060
So every future Firefox window opens.

1022
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,060
I see.

1023
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,020
That's perfect.

1024
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,300
Right.

1025
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,980
So then it keeps just Telegram clean.

1026
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,740
So I have just Telegram on that workspace.

1027
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,580
And it puts the browser in a different workspace.

1028
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,280
And when I want to go see your fancy link,

1029
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,540
I just move to that workspace.

1030
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,580
But if you want to go pop over and find out

1031
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,180
what's for brunch with Brent, then you'll know.

1032
00:38:59,180 --> 00:38:59,420
Right.

1033
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,540
Well, it's always delicious.

1034
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,100
I don't even need to check.

1035
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,300
Like here in the studio, when we open up Quasl,

1036
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,340
we have a KWIN window rule to always put it on desktop too.

1037
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,380
It's so nice.

1038
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:12,180
Now I kind of have that same functionality.

1039
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,260
Is it all the way?

1040
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,820
No.

1041
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,860
No, it won't do like this particular size

1042
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,180
in this particular region.

1043
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,700
But most applications will remember their size

1044
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,300
and position.

1045
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,100
So if you put them on the right workspace,

1046
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:28,020
they'll just resume in the spot that they were at.

1047
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,580
So that works.

1048
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,340
That's nice.

1049
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,220
Auto-move windows, and then I had

1050
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,740
to change up and get rid of my beloved Guake.

1051
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,140
It just was time.

1052
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:37,660
Of course.

1053
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,780
I mean, there's some hotkeys involved, right?

1054
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,400
And it's not a Wayland native application yet.

1055
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,060
And Drew recommended Tilex.

1056
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,860
We've heard of it before.

1057
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,460
It may have even been a pick years ago.

1058
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,820
I'm sure it was.

1059
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,540
And it's a great tiling terminal emulator.

1060
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,740
And my second Gnome Shell plug-in

1061
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,660
uses Tilex to do the drop-down terminal.

1062
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,380
So I can hit the tilde key, and I get a drop-down terminal,

1063
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,700
and it's using Tilex.

1064
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,220
Slick.

1065
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:04,700
Yeah.

1066
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,700
So it's, you know.

1067
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,380
Well, what do you think?

1068
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,900
Are you liking it as a terminal?

1069
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,980
That's an important thing.

1070
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,820
It's great.

1071
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,700
Tilex has always been a solid app.

1072
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,340
I just never had a strong need to use it.

1073
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,380
And Gnome Shell's terminal's fine, but Tilex is great.

1074
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,740
It's great.

1075
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,620
Drew, what are your favorite Tilex features?

1076
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:26,100
Because I'm brand new to it, and it's like my go-to now

1077
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,940
already.

1078
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,500
First of all, just UI, it's great.

1079
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,060
Second of all, feature-wise, it's kind of unmatched.

1080
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,260
Yeah, so it has the features where

1081
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,500
you can split the terminal window

1082
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:43,620
into multiple sections, left, right, or top, bottom.

1083
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,780
As the name implies, sure.

1084
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,540
Right, exactly.

1085
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,300
So it's tiling.

1086
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:51,460
But in addition to that, you can open up multiple tabs.

1087
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,020
Except the tabs, you can do them several different ways.

1088
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,060
You can either have it as a list down the left or right side

1089
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,980
with previews, where you can actually

1090
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:06,120
see what each tab looks like, including with their tiling.

1091
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:10,260
And that's kind of the biggest part of what makes it up

1092
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,500
as an application.

1093
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,620
Beyond that, I think it's just kind

1094
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,660
of quality of life improvements.

1095
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:21,140
Like, for example, using the newer style GTK scroll bars

1096
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,780
versus using Gnome Terminal, you've got that static scroll

1097
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,780
bar that's just kind of over there on the right

1098
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,380
and looks a little old, whereas with Tilex,

1099
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,280
it's got the thin scroll bar until you go over it,

1100
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,860
and then it expands.

1101
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,940
And it goes directly over top of the content,

1102
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,020
so it's not like this whole separate thing.

1103
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,860
So the whole thing to me just feels

1104
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,660
like if you took Gnome Terminal and pushed it

1105
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,740
to the modern equivalent of what it should or could be,

1106
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,180
and that's kind of where it is.

1107
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,780
It's also, and this is some of the features

1108
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,220
that I find to be, like this is where I'm going to Tilex

1109
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,860
all the time now, is it has some great different options around

1110
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,260
how it handles copy and pasted content.

1111
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,020
And that's really fancy, so check it out.

1112
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,900
We'll have a link in the show notes.

1113
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,820
We've mentioned it before, so enough with that.

1114
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,780
But I want to do a little update on how some

1115
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,660
of the different projects are getting along

1116
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,700
with Wayland support.

1117
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,260
So the number one question, probably the elephant

1118
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,140
in the room at this point, is what about NVIDIA?

1119
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,060
The story there isn't great.

1120
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,820
You've noticed we haven't really mentioned any of us

1121
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,460
are using it.

1122
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,940
However, different projects are getting along with support.

1123
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,780
In fact, the Kaywin project for Plasma Desktop

1124
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:37,740
now lists initial support in Plasma 5.16

1125
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,260
for the NVIDIA binary.

1126
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,620
Oh, nice.

1127
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:44,460
Partial work around, they say.

1128
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,420
OK, maybe it's gross.

1129
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:45,940
I don't know.

1130
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,380
Yeah, I don't know.

1131
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,980
But the situation is getting better.

1132
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,780
I think that's the overall story there,

1133
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,620
is the situation is improving.

1134
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,700
For GNOME, especially GNOME 3.34,

1135
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,820
there's refined X Wayland support.

1136
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,980
So X11 applications run even better,

1137
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,900
smoother, and with pseudo support, which is great.

1138
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,660
That is nice.

1139
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,460
Yeah.

1140
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,140
And the Amate desktop is working on implementing Wayland support

1141
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,740
via Mir.

1142
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,500
There is a demo video up on YouTube you can see now.

1143
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,340
But Mir essentially acts as a stable API

1144
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,020
to interface with Wayland.

1145
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,940
Yeah, you can sort of bridge right over to it.

1146
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,740
That's a really interesting use case for it.

1147
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:26,780
And that work is primarily being done by a canonical developer

1148
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,620
who is not Martin Wimpress.

1149
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,660
And then we'll have a link to the Plasma state of affairs,

1150
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:36,180
which looks pretty strong, and Drew DeVault's blog post

1151
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,220
on Wayland misconceptions.

1152
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,700
Yeah, there's a lot of good info there.

1153
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,420
In his, let's say, traditional style,

1154
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,500
there's a little bit of brazenness at times,

1155
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,420
let's say, because sometimes it's true,

1156
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,660
like there are missing features.

1157
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,460
But the only way to get those features

1158
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,220
is for the people who want them to show up, as he says,

1159
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,500
and get to work.

1160
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,740
They're happy to offer whatever support.

1161
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:01,220
He develops the WL roots project along with others.

1162
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,700
So there's a lot of work going on.

1163
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,180
We just kind of have to try it all out,

1164
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,860
figure out what's lacking, and then support

1165
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,140
development of those features however we can.

1166
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,500
Mobile Room, any of you on Wayland for a daily driver

1167
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,180
or a frequently used machine?

1168
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,940
Anybody rolling that particular dice at this point,

1169
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,820
or are you all X11 users in there?

1170
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:23,860
Well, I tried Wayland on my Chromebook,

1171
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,020
and I was pretty happy with it.

1172
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:28,860
But I have certain workflows.

1173
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:33,300
And Wayland has still some missing features.

1174
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,980
Like you say, I have, for example,

1175
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,020
mouse clicks based on window names.

1176
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,980
So if I have Firefox and do a left click, it goes side back.

1177
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,420
And if I do the same thing in Audacious and Lollipop,

1178
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,980
it goes last song.

1179
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,980
And I'm missing these kind of features in Wayland.

1180
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,580
If we get that, I'm ready to switch, probably.

1181
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,180
What about you, Dan?

1182
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,220
Are you, by any chance, a Wayland roller?

1183
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,020
I tried it a while back on Ubuntu with Gnome.

1184
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:07,300
But I'm using Ubuntu Mate now, so I'm

1185
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,300
struggling to get that running.

1186
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,700
And in that situation, I would imagine

1187
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,700
you're probably like most, you'll probably

1188
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,500
switch when the project switched as a default, right?

1189
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,420
Yeah, I will.

1190
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,060
Yeah.

1191
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:18,660
What about you, Byte?

1192
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,660
Have you tried out Wayland?

1193
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,860
Are you a Wayland roller, as I'm now calling it,

1194
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,980
which is kind of obnoxious?

1195
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,780
I love it.

1196
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,980
No, I'm just waiting until a WM-based distro comes up

1197
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,340
with the standard.

1198
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,220
Fair enough.

1199
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,180
I mean, I'm curious to see where the Monte project gets

1200
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,260
with a mere back end.

1201
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,860
Because that could be what I'll just

1202
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:45,220
say more niche desktops end up using, potentially,

1203
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,500
however that plays out.

1204
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,260
Because you're not really seeing a lot of progress

1205
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,580
on the desktops outside of Plasma and Gnome Shell

1206
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,740
at this point.

1207
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:54,580
Strong words.

1208
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,940
And with the new XFCE release just out, wow.

1209
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,300
Well, if I was the XFCE project, and I

1210
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,860
needed to start working on something,

1211
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,340
it'd be nice to have a stable API to develop against.

1212
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,660
And that's what Mir is offering.

1213
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,780
And if there is code that the Monte project uses,

1214
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,260
which is another GTK-based desktop that I could also

1215
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,540
take advantage of, that would be pretty compelling.

1216
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,340
And if you look at it, there's a lot of desktops out there.

1217
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,380
And they're all pretty dependent on X11.

1218
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,700
They're going to be looking for some kind of solution.

1219
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:27,060
Now, projects like Plasma and Gnome Shell, debatably,

1220
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,660
have the resources to develop for the full protocol

1221
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,820
on their own.

1222
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:35,180
But not every project has that amount of horsepower

1223
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,540
to do that kind of development.

1224
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,860
But also, if you aren't that different or can share,

1225
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:44,540
we could share and then have some sort of common back end,

1226
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,820
which might mean we can concentrate development there

1227
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,940
and have something better.

1228
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,700
But if you want to give it a go, check out

1229
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,340
some of the links we have in the show notes for extensions

1230
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,860
or application replacements.

1231
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:58,260
And live the lean extension lifestyle, if possible.

1232
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,620
You won't have much of a choice.

1233
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,380
There are still enough extensions available

1234
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,380
to get you in trouble.

1235
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,180
So there's still plenty out there.

1236
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,300
Be careful.

1237
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,500
Single-threaded.

1238
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,980
All right, well, let's move on to a question I think

1239
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,820
might just be perfect for Alex.

1240
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,340
Ed wrote to me on Twitter, at ChrisLAS,

1241
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,900
I've been out of the loop for a while,

1242
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,180
and now I need to back up a bunch of family data.

1243
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,300
I'm looking for a good incremental backup solution

1244
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,060
that will use little storage.

1245
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:26,060
He plans, if possible, to upload the backup to Google Drive.

1246
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,460
His server is Ubuntu 19-something.

1247
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,540
He doesn't say what.

1248
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:33,580
I'm going to assume 1910, 1904, probably one of those.

1249
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,540
It's a good bet.

1250
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,380
And if you have any suggestions, he says, he'd love to know.

1251
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,980
And thanks for our time, Alex.

1252
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,460
I'm curious to know if you have any go-to backup strategies

1253
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,980
to get data up on Google Drive.

1254
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:46,540
I might, yeah.

1255
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,500
Share them with us.

1256
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,580
Give us a little taste.

1257
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,060
The one that I use the most is called rClone.

1258
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:56,860
And this uses the fuse to translate transparently

1259
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:01,660
a Google Drive and many other endpoints, for that matter,

1260
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,260
transparently to the host operating system.

1261
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,020
That's a good one.

1262
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,700
There's so many solutions out there.

1263
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,260
There's so many different ways you could go that

1264
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,860
depend on your setup that you just,

1265
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,780
there's a lot of complex issues around this

1266
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,900
that you have to consider.

1267
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,460
So Wes, you have some sort of resource

1268
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,660
people could use that will help them at least see their options?

1269
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,940
Yeah, I was just looking around and found

1270
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,380
it looks like a new list put together.

1271
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,260
They kind of just had a lot of these keys,

1272
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,500
little tags for each program.

1273
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,540
Because it kind of depends.

1274
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,580
Are you considering integrating lots of cloud support,

1275
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,080
or are you just looking for something

1276
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,620
that can cryptographically verify and encrypt

1277
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,340
and then supports incremental?

1278
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:38,100
Or you want the replication as part of the backup tool

1279
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,140
or not, right?

1280
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,300
Back in the days of TechSnap with Dan,

1281
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,220
bacula was a common option that he really liked for managing

1282
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,180
big systems for backups.

1283
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:49,940
For some personal stuff, I've used RESTIC before,

1284
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,140
which I've enjoyed a lot.

1285
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,620
And I have a few things up in TARSNAP, which is not

1286
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:58,740
necessarily open source, but is a nice program, nice setup.

1287
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,380
And you can read the code.

1288
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,100
And the developer is brilliant.

1289
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,900
Another one that I use, which Linux Server Maker Docker for,

1290
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,060
is Duplicati.

1291
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,160
And this allows you to do incremental file level backup.

1292
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,660
I've heard from a good handful of folks in the audience

1293
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,580
that use Duplicati.

1294
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,100
So I think I've looked at it lightly.

1295
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,420
And it sounds like it's pretty popular in the audience.

1296
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,020
So Duplicati could be another one to look at.

1297
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,580
Put those in the show notes.

1298
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:28,020
If Google isn't your endpoint, there's always rsync.

1299
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,100
Just keep it simple.

1300
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,300
Yeah, all right.

1301
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,900
If you have any suggestions, tweet me.

1302
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,100
Let me know, at Chris Elias.

1303
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,500
Or join our Telegram, jupitabroadcasting.com

1304
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,100
slash telegram.

1305
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,500
I'm sure we've missed your favorite backup tool,

1306
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,140
because there are 1,000.

1307
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,140
Yeah, there are a lot.

1308
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:41,780
There are a lot.

1309
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,900
And maybe we'll get a few good suggestions,

1310
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,380
and we can integrate them into future coverage.

1311
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,580
Carry a pigeon.

1312
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,900
Now, we have a couple of picks this week.

1313
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,580
Alex, you saved the segment, because I

1314
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,100
got a pick in here that I'm kind of meh about,

1315
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,660
because it's sort of limited.

1316
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,180
It's early days.

1317
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:02,700
It's an open Apple AirDrop implementation

1318
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,580
written in Python.

1319
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:09,060
As iPhone users out there really, really need

1320
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,500
an AirDrop solution on Linux.

1321
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:14,180
AirDrop is a great solution for Mac to Mac or Mac to iPhone.

1322
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,140
But Linux users, we don't get to participate in this,

1323
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,140
because all this interesting implementation details.

1324
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,380
So that's where OpenDrop comes in.

1325
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,300
It is an AirDrop implementation written in Python.

1326
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:26,900
We'll see.

1327
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,820
We'll see.

1328
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:29,180
It has certain requirements.

1329
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,220
I think it might only work from Linux to Mac.

1330
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:35,220
It requires that you install a few packages via brew on Mac OS.

1331
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,020
So I wasn't feeling good about this.

1332
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,700
But I wanted to let those of you out there know that need this.

1333
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,380
There could be something.

1334
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,740
And Alex came in with a Hail Mary for our pick segment today.

1335
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,300
And it's special.

1336
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:51,220
It's really something that's going to drive you crazy.

1337
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,860
It's called Process Wallpaper.

1338
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,140
Tell me about this, Alex.

1339
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:58,620
Have you ever wanted your wallpaper to be a cloud of words

1340
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,740
showing your most used process?

1341
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,620
Well, if you have, great news.

1342
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,540
I've never wanted that.

1343
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,820
Never in my life wanted that.

1344
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:06,620
But now you see it.

1345
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,940
You do want it, right?

1346
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:08,500
I kind of do.

1347
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,940
It uses pleasant colors.

1348
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,260
Oh, yeah, it looks kind of nice.

1349
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,380
I almost want to try it.

1350
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,740
Now, do be careful that you're only running things

1351
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,420
with polite names now.

1352
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,740
I suppose so.

1353
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:24,180
It looks like if you want Spotify and Gnome Shell

1354
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,820
on your background, this is a good picture.

1355
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,580
That's a good way to do it.

1356
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,900
I am now a little curious what mine would look like.

1357
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,900
You should try it.

1358
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,580
It's pretty neat.

1359
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,700
It's a Python script that basically looks

1360
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,580
at all your processes and then puts together

1361
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:39,020
a nice color-coordinated word cloud

1362
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,420
and sets that as your background.

1363
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,620
And it's neater than you'd think, actually.

1364
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:43,740
It looks kind of good.

1365
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,940
But doesn't that just chew up more CPU cycles?

1366
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,260
Well, you'll know if it shows up on your background.

1367
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:50,020
Yeah, exactly.

1368
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,820
That's the one thing that seems to be

1369
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:55,260
missing on their example wallpaper

1370
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,980
is their own application name.

1371
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,900
It's interesting that ex-Wayland shows up, but not much.

1372
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,180
So whoever took the screenshot is a Wayland user.

1373
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,460
How fitting for today's episode.

1374
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,220
That is perfect.

1375
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,420
Diddle down in the chat room saying Konki.

1376
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:08,980
Oh, yeah.

1377
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,140
If you've got weeks and weeks to spare, sure.

1378
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,380
Good memories and bad memories with Konki right there.

1379
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,500
It's been a while since I've sort of tuned my desktop

1380
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,020
and gone to that level.

1381
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,180
What's the install process?

1382
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:20,820
I've got to look at that.

1383
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:21,300
Oh, yeah.

1384
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:21,820
So it's easy.

1385
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:22,900
It's just a Python script.

1386
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,140
You probably already have Python 3.

1387
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:29,900
A GNOME desktop environment is required for setup.ssh

1388
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,460
to change the wallpaper automatically,

1389
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,500
but it will export just a PNG.

1390
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,860
So you can hook that up to your desktop however you want.

1391
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,740
Wow, this is a really on-topic pick, Alex.

1392
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:40,500
See how he just saved the segment right there?

1393
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,260
He just saved it.

1394
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,100
You're welcome.

1395
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,340
I was coming in with this crappy half-working open AirDrop

1396
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:49,780
alternative, and you gave us a lemonade, so I appreciate that.

1397
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,940
Thank you, Alex.

1398
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,220
It's a pleasure.

1399
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,140
All right, thank you to the mumble room as well.

1400
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:55,900
What do you got there, Wes?

1401
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,220
You tried it?

1402
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,580
Oh, yeah, I tried it.

1403
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,140
Actually looks kind of good.

1404
00:52:59,140 --> 00:52:59,860
Doesn't look bad.

1405
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,340
Chrome is using a lot of resources.

1406
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:05,100
Yeah, I forgot that I was running wine for some Jack

1407
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:05,940
plugin.

1408
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,300
What's going on here?

1409
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,380
You say Electron.

1410
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,180
I say Flash 2.0.

1411
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,220
That's right.

1412
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,900
All right, so that's the show, I guess.

1413
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,900
Thanks for coming.

1414
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,140

We do it at 2 PM Pacific.

1421
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,100
You do the math.

1422
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,220
See you next Tuesday!

1423
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:46,220
I'm going to go get some coffee.

1424
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,220
See you.

1425
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,220
Bye.

1426
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,220
Bye.

1427
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,220
Bye.

1428
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,220
Bye.

1429
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,220
Bye.

1430
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,220
Bye.

1431
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,220
Bye.

1432
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,220
Bye.

1433
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,220
Bye.

1434
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,220
Bye.

1435
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,220
Bye.

1436
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,220
Bye.

1437
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,220
Bye.

1438
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,220
Bye.

1439
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,220
Bye.

1440
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,220
Bye.

1441
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,220
Bye.

1442
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,220
Bye.

1443
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,220
See you later.

1444
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,520
Hey, Unplugged program.

1445
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,520
Oh—all right.

1446
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:13,440
Now, we've got to title this thing.

1447
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,320
There's a story that didn't quite make it into the show I was looking at.

1448
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,280
Oh, it's just what you figure.

1449
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:24,120
If you were going to place a bet on if vendor firmwares work patched and following modern

1450
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,760
practices, you'd probably bet that they're not.

1451
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,760
Right?

1452
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:27,760
Yeah.

1453
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,760
Oh, yeah.

1454
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,760
Shocker.

1455
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,760
It's true.

1456
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:36,280
is what one researcher found. That's, according to Sarah Zataco, she's the chief scientist

1457
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,880
at the Cyber Independent Testing Lab, which is a nonprofit organization that conducts

1458
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:46,740
independent tests on software security. Quote, we found no consistency in vendor or product

1459
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:51,560
line doing better, or even showing improvement. There was no evidence that anybody is making

1460
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,680
a concerted effort to address, to address, I like this, safety hygiene of their products.

1461
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,840
Yeah, oh man, Microtech's looking pretty bad in this little result, as is Belkin.

1462
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:07,600
Well, Asus doesn't look so good either, and sorry Ubiquiti fanboys, which there are many

1463
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:17,000
of, the UAP AC Pro wireless access points, as well as the D-Link DWL 6600 access points,

1464
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,860
suck. They only did slightly better than average on the overall assessment. Yeah, sorry.

1465
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:27,920
I have three, five, nine of those in deployment right now.

1466
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:34,720
You know, I looked at doing this, covering this story in the TechSnap episode that's

1467
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,400
coming out later this week, but it was just too depressing.

1468
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,800
It is a bit of a bummer, and I think it continues to validate why it's important that we as

1469
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,760
consumers have the option to install our own firmwares.

1470
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,160
Yeah, and we need to figure out a way to make this, you know, a thing that, like, how do

1471
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,160
we get this in the culture so that we have ways to know? Because if you don't know, you

1472
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,800
can't actually choose what you're buying with any validation.

1473
00:55:53,800 --> 00:56:00,040
I kind of think you could get awareness about the issues with the firmware via the conversation

1474
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,880
about why it's important consumers can install a firmware.

1475
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,880
Right.

1476
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:08,040
Because it'll sort of beget the question, well, why? And then in that conversation,

1477
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,840
you'll talk about all of the issues. And I think the way to start having that conversation

1478
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:18,920
is to really hammer on the point that these are devices in our homes. We buy these, we

1479
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,720
own these, and then we put them in our homes.

1480
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,040
Oftentimes, they control access, right? They're like a gateway to our home.

1481
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:31,000
So it should be my right to install anything I want. If I want to attempt to put Windows

1482
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,920
10 on a Linksys, I should have...

1483
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,920
You are a madman.

1484
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,080
I would never, but I should be able to at least flash it with my own firmware. It is

1485
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:42,760
just like if I wanted to, for some reason, take the door off my microwave. You know,

1486
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,520
it's a dumb thing to do in some cases.

1487
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:47,080
That's why the studio looks like this.

1488
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,000
Have you put a fork in there yet? Try a CD. It's great.
