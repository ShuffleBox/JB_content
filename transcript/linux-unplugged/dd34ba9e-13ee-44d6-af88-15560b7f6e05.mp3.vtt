00:00.000 --> 00:05.480
Alexa, spell Linux.

00:05.480 --> 00:09.920
Linux is spelled L-I-N-U-X.

00:09.920 --> 00:10.920
That's not bad.

00:10.920 --> 00:15.880
I'm not sure I could do that.

00:15.880 --> 00:32.800
This is Linux Amplug episode 178 for January 3rd, 2017.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.520
Welcome to It's Unplugged.

00:35.520 --> 00:36.520
That's pretty close.

00:36.520 --> 00:40.880
Your weekly Linux talk show that's celebrating the New Year's with robots.

00:40.880 --> 00:41.880
My name is Chris.

00:41.880 --> 00:42.880
My name is Wes.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.080
I think I could do a better job than the Echo there.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.080
What do you think?

00:46.080 --> 00:49.000
You have had more practice than she has though, so in fairness.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.880
Hello everybody and welcome back and happy 2017.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.000
This is really Linux Unplugged.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.520
No, I'm not even sure what she said.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.520
I don't even know if she...

00:56.520 --> 00:57.520
Nope.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.520
No idea.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.280
But if you haven't guessed, later on in the show we'll be talking about securing the internet

01:01.280 --> 01:05.360
of things and how open source might be able to solve this particular problem and take

01:05.360 --> 01:09.240
something that's typically cloud-based and make it all local.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.240
What?

01:10.240 --> 01:11.240
Yeah.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.240
That's later on in the show.

01:12.240 --> 01:16.880
We'll be getting our 2017 predictions from our virtual lug, getting all prepped and ready

01:16.880 --> 01:20.720
for this Sunday's Linux action show, the official predictions episode.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.720
It's a big moment, Wes.

01:21.720 --> 01:22.800
That's a huge moment.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.840
This last week we put it off to review Solace.

01:24.840 --> 01:25.840
I saw that.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.880
Yeah, it's just like we had to go that way.

01:27.880 --> 01:32.320
But I got a couple emails and I can't remember if it was a tweet or a telegram.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.600
Somebody said, I really missed the predictions episode.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.080
Now the anticipation is building.

01:36.080 --> 01:40.560
And then the other guys, I got an email that said, I had a bet going on your predictions.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.680
And then you didn't do it.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.440
So we're going to get a little bit of that taken care of today.

01:45.440 --> 01:46.440
Not all of them.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.440
What's your appetite?

01:47.440 --> 01:50.560
Yeah, we've got to make room for some great open source project updates.

01:50.560 --> 01:51.560
I don't know.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.160
Maybe some of these open source developers got a little time off for the holidays and

01:54.160 --> 01:55.160
they banged out some code.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.160
Come back fresh at it.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.160
I know that's how I am.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:58.160 --> 02:02.800
So check it out, guys, because in a little bit we're going to have some great stories.

02:02.800 --> 02:07.760
And what I think could be a great trend for 2017.

02:07.760 --> 02:11.320
But first, let's bring in our virtual hug for the first time this year.

02:11.320 --> 02:13.920
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:13.920 --> 02:14.920
Time appropriate greetings.

02:14.920 --> 02:15.920
Happy New Year.

02:15.920 --> 02:16.920
Hello, everybody.

02:16.920 --> 02:17.920
Hello.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.880
It is good to see you.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.080
And I want to start out, I want to start Jesus.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.960
There's no way half this beer that you brought us could be hitting me that fast.

02:26.960 --> 02:34.080
But I guess by the way, Mr. Mr. West over there really, really outdid himself this week.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.800
He brought an Odin's gift.

02:35.800 --> 02:36.800
It's a gift for you.

02:36.800 --> 02:40.200
Which come on, how can you I can't ask for a better gift than Odin's gift.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.400
And it's an amber ale brewed with juniper berries, which is sounds a lot like Jupiter

02:44.400 --> 02:45.400
berries.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.400
It sure does.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.400
Yeah.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.400
So you really you're just pushing all the buttons.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.400
Is it local to us?

02:49.400 --> 02:50.400
Is it is it a local brew?

02:50.400 --> 02:51.400
Tequila, Washington.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.360
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.360
Well done, sir.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.360
Well done.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.360
That is my pleasure.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.360
Well done.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.440
So I've I've been talking about this since the beginning of last year.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.680
Feels a little weird to say.

03:03.680 --> 03:09.040
And I think I think, gosh, I just I don't mean to say I told you so.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.040
But I think maybe I told you so I think you did.

03:12.040 --> 03:16.080
There are more and more people these days that are looking for an alternative to Mac

03:16.080 --> 03:18.120
OS, a special group of people.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.800
I'm not going to sit here and pretend like it's millions of users not going to pretend

03:20.800 --> 03:25.760
like Apple is going to fall apart because of how your average designer or art person

03:25.760 --> 03:27.240
or whatever.

03:27.240 --> 03:34.000
But there are there are those like the fellow over a bit cannon bit cannon dotnet wrote up

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
an awesome post.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.120
And here's why I say it's awesome, because it's it feels like it's from the perspective

03:39.120 --> 03:43.320
of an analytical engineer or somebody who's laying it all out there.

03:43.320 --> 03:48.720
And it really breaks down the process from from the perspective of not not the Apple

03:48.720 --> 03:53.480
user that we we Linux users like to portray that the hipster with the tight jeans and

03:53.480 --> 03:56.880
and it's a concern about the image and the.

03:56.880 --> 04:03.560
This is this is someone who is smart and rational like yourself that.

04:03.560 --> 04:08.740
Chose a different path and is now using that same intellect that shows that path to evaluate

04:08.740 --> 04:09.740
other paths.

04:09.740 --> 04:10.740
And so he's right.

04:10.740 --> 04:12.480
I've used Mac OS since the public beta.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.240
I use it both at home and work.

04:14.240 --> 04:17.360
I've also run various Linux distributions and BSD since around 2000.

04:17.360 --> 04:22.320
So he's got some familiarity working with here, mostly using Ruby and has had some experience

04:22.320 --> 04:24.280
with a PC that he built on the side.

04:24.280 --> 04:28.840
It's got an Intel like I seven run at four gigahertz with lots of RAM and SSD and he

04:28.840 --> 04:30.340
put arch on that.

04:30.340 --> 04:33.640
But he mostly just SSH is into that from the Mac box to do Ruby development.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.320
And it's way faster than the Mac box.

04:36.320 --> 04:40.920
But recently he said there's been more and more appealing to a more and more appeal to

04:40.920 --> 04:44.120
switching from, you know, switching away from the Mac.

04:44.120 --> 04:47.800
He says, I spent a fair bit of time pondering the appeal of the switch.

04:47.800 --> 04:52.840
These are some of the benefits as I see them access to a regularly updated pro hardware.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.520
I'll give that a day.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.880
Not restricted to Apple hardware that makes choices that I don't value, such as removing

04:58.880 --> 05:05.900
the escape key, removing all legacy ports, the set, the set, the set, necessitating cheese,

05:05.900 --> 05:12.160
the use of dongles for everything, though that may be our future regardless, I wonder

05:12.160 --> 05:16.300
and prioritizing thinness and weight over everything else.

05:16.300 --> 05:20.080
Also access to hardware that Apple doesn't make such as two in one laptops, getting comfortable

05:20.080 --> 05:23.640
with alternatives before I'm forced to the ability to inspect and contribute to the OS

05:23.640 --> 05:24.640
I use.

05:24.640 --> 05:28.360
Oh, and using OS where developers are first class citizens.

05:28.360 --> 05:32.000
Oh, also see stagnation of the Mac App Store.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.040
Drawbacks of switching time required to find replacements of the software I use like Alfred

05:36.040 --> 05:40.600
one pass and sketch the lack of access to the iOS SDK because he does maintain an app

05:40.600 --> 05:41.600
in the iOS store.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.600
Yeah, that's rough.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.600
Yeah.

05:43.600 --> 05:47.200
He evaluated a bunch of different alternatives from Anna Gross and arch and bida and elementary

05:47.200 --> 05:48.400
really quite a good list.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.400
Yeah.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.400
This is on there.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.480
I see honorary mentions give deep in and haiku and redox.

05:53.480 --> 05:58.560
Here's kind of what he was looking for integrated consistent experience, good design, and simple

05:58.560 --> 06:02.720
easy to use high dpi support, which is underscored and timely updates.

06:02.720 --> 06:04.780
Top pick is fedora.

06:04.780 --> 06:10.320
Actually really top pick he says all three top picks were known based fedora, arch straight

06:10.320 --> 06:15.960
and elementary, which is not actually known three, which is his favorite right now says

06:15.960 --> 06:20.440
elementary is what he's going with human interface guidelines, which are a plus in his opinion,

06:20.440 --> 06:26.120
native programming language, or at least a primary focus, Vala, not Python.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.120
And that's it.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.120
That's what he says.

06:28.120 --> 06:32.360
A model for funding ongoing development bug bounties, Patreon asking for payment with downloading.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.160
That's an interesting thing.

06:34.160 --> 06:38.320
I could see why that would absolutely from the professional developer angle, someone

06:38.320 --> 06:42.560
who's used to you know, maybe he had paid for OS X updates back when that was the thing

06:42.560 --> 06:45.940
could be a and you know, and there are a lot of like, if you have an app, especially

06:45.940 --> 06:49.800
in that OS X ecosystem, a lot of really good apps you pay for, but you you know, you value

06:49.800 --> 06:50.800
them.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.640
Yeah, I just thinking about it, it really does matter to me that the Destro I'm using

06:53.640 --> 06:58.480
maybe has a full time developer to on if I'm using a full on curated distro.

06:58.480 --> 07:02.200
Let's get Ikey funded so we can do this full time is he doesn't think he does it full time.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.360
That's a really good question.

07:04.360 --> 07:08.220
Also designers as well as developers are on the team that he likes that they have a design

07:08.220 --> 07:10.500
angle and then he just sort of wraps it up.

07:10.500 --> 07:17.200
My ideal would be elementary on top of free BSD only your ideal man.

07:17.200 --> 07:21.200
He says next I plan to resize the arch partition on my work PC and install elementary alongside

07:21.200 --> 07:25.080
I'll aim to do all of my work duties on that machine and post how it goes.

07:25.080 --> 07:29.000
So I have a link in his in the show notes if you want to follow the blog as he goes

07:29.000 --> 07:30.740
along.

07:30.740 --> 07:34.920
Now I reason I want to talk about this because we could we could sit here and we could talk

07:34.920 --> 07:41.840
about Michael Dominic from Coder Radio or Leo Laporte or or or Bit Cannon.

07:41.840 --> 07:45.440
I mean there's so many there's those are so many example.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.620
Those are three examples of so many what I believe represent so many other people they're

07:48.620 --> 07:52.200
doing the same evaluation and I'm not doing this to harp on the MacBook.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.520
I don't really give a crap about that anymore.

07:54.520 --> 08:00.800
It just I think it's I think this I think this I think there is a new reality and that

08:00.800 --> 08:04.800
new reality is there is a there is an area of the market that Apple's decided it is no

08:04.800 --> 08:09.920
longer worth their investment to target based on the overall importance of the Mac to the

08:09.920 --> 08:13.400
Apple overall profitable ecosystem.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.920
And those people that are realizing that are looking for something else and they don't

08:15.920 --> 08:17.320
want to go to Windows.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.660
They really don't at Windows 10.

08:19.660 --> 08:24.040
The thing is is this is hitting I believe this is hitting when the Windows 10 hype train

08:24.040 --> 08:26.180
is stopped right.

08:26.180 --> 08:28.680
People at this point feel like it's a fine version of Windows.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.920
Maybe it's one of the better ones.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.640
But there are probably still a lot of Mac users especially who aren't ready to go back.

08:34.640 --> 08:38.000
You know they left they probably left or they've been using it a long enough time.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.240
Well here's the thing about Windows 10.

08:40.240 --> 08:44.600
All the things used that drove you crazy about Windows still exist.

08:44.600 --> 08:48.800
The crazy nightmare of downloading setup.exe to install your drivers.

08:48.800 --> 08:52.000
The crazy high DPI support that is totally non-existent.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.020
The mishmash of interfaces the 10 different ways to set your power management settings.

08:56.020 --> 09:01.120
All of these the integration of market trend of the year when they release the OS.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.120
That is so obnoxious.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.560
Like the Cortana features.

09:03.560 --> 09:04.560
Give me a break.

09:04.560 --> 09:09.060
Well and I think there's a difference like the Windows can produce these sorts of Windows

09:09.060 --> 09:10.060
power users.

09:10.060 --> 09:12.640
I think we've talked a lot about switching to Linux in the past.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.000
And they're the kind of people that know that right.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.320
Like they understand that there's going to be three different menus to configure things.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.320
They know how to go deep.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.400
They know how to do the regedit.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.800
That doesn't really exist in OSX to the same degree.

09:21.800 --> 09:25.400
Whereas these people are looking at OSX as like a this was their functional computer.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.800
I think it's interesting because I think I think a class of these people are probably

09:28.800 --> 09:34.720
on MacBooks and using Mac OS because their taste which they would probably classify as

09:34.720 --> 09:40.600
discerning would right would sort of compel them to go that direction.

09:40.600 --> 09:44.760
There's not a lot except for some of the more popular newer distributions I think that might

09:44.760 --> 09:48.680
that meet the level of quote unquote discerning tastes of a Mac user.

09:48.680 --> 09:55.000
And I'm not trying to be combative but I think it conveys the image like there is a certain

09:55.000 --> 10:00.040
standard they're going for in terms of quality and consistency and elementary OS is sort

10:00.040 --> 10:01.040
of unique.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.160
Solus is also pretty great in that way.

10:03.160 --> 10:07.520
And Gnome 3 desktop in general is the best generally available desktop that I think I

10:07.520 --> 10:10.780
honestly believe out of the box is the most consistent.

10:10.780 --> 10:13.840
And there's something about that like I mean obviously we've talked a lot about Plasma

10:13.840 --> 10:17.680
5 and how great it is but there's something about the simplicity of Gnome that matches

10:17.680 --> 10:21.960
more with also bear in mind too that he's specifically requiring high DPI which sort

10:21.960 --> 10:23.520
of focuses.

10:23.520 --> 10:24.520
Plasma is good.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.160
It's great actually.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.640
Plasma is still slightly inconsistent high DPI compared to them three.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.200
And that's really no three ballpark right now.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.200
Yeah.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.960
The GTK three GTK three.

10:33.960 --> 10:38.200
So I think it's sort of a fascinating trend that is going to increase in 2017 and it's

10:38.200 --> 10:41.560
why I just wanted to cover it at the top here because this is sort of what this episode

10:41.560 --> 10:43.600
is about is these types of things.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.400
Mr. Jude you have a point.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
Yeah.

10:46.400 --> 10:51.760
A lot of the people that I know that use Mac books it was not so much about the window

10:51.760 --> 10:54.160
manager and stuff but the apps.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.520
The apps and the fact that it has a shell right.

10:55.520 --> 10:59.600
I need my email that's going to be reliable and I want my browser it's always going to

10:59.600 --> 11:00.600
work.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.600
Yeah.

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
Yeah.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.400
You know both Chromium and Firefox under open source operating systems are some time

11:05.400 --> 11:11.320
a bit not perfect whereas well especially previous versions of Mac OS you could rely

11:11.320 --> 11:14.760
on the OS not to crash and your apps to work.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.400
That's actually not as true anymore.

11:16.400 --> 11:21.800
It's not just the hardware that Apple is falling down on but the fact that NFS and the latest

11:21.800 --> 11:25.600
version of OS 10 will crash if you try to connect to things.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.600
Right.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.600
Right.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.600
And you know to that point.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.080
And also just people having troubles with even just the web browser and email not working

11:31.080 --> 11:32.080
properly.

11:32.080 --> 11:36.040
To that point there was a release of Mac OS where I can't remember what the reason was.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.800
I think it was a licensing issue.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.000
They just ripped out Samba and implemented their own.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Oh right.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
That was pretty recently.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
Yeah.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.080
Their own SMB client and it just is absolute shit.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.240
It's shit.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.040
It's bad bad bad.

11:50.040 --> 11:54.640
And it's gotten better now in previous in excessive releases because that's releases

11:54.640 --> 11:58.200
but it's just was awful back then and it was just an example of something that just didn't

11:58.200 --> 11:59.200
really care for pro users.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.200
They wouldn't.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.200
They wouldn't.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.480
And it's another where you know maybe you have these skills you've used SIFs on other

12:04.480 --> 12:07.840
servers and now maybe the Mac implementation is different for perhaps no good reason.

12:07.840 --> 12:11.520
I think too and Alan I wonder if you agree do you think that some of it has to do with

12:11.520 --> 12:15.520
just more people shifting workload into the web browser or do you think it's still more

12:15.520 --> 12:18.360
about the native apps.

12:18.360 --> 12:24.680
I think it's a little bit less about native apps now but I think what we need to look

12:24.680 --> 12:29.480
at from this is actually getting back the idea of the reason any development happens

12:29.480 --> 12:33.000
in open source is developers scratching their own itch.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.040
So this might be the golden opportunity to get more developers back to using Linux or

12:38.040 --> 12:43.080
BSD and refining that desktop experience to make it good enough for them whereas before

12:43.080 --> 12:47.240
it was not quite good enough to drive them to get to go with the Mac instead.

12:47.240 --> 12:50.560
Yeah sort of critical mass thing.

12:50.560 --> 12:54.680
Before I go any further I should mention Alan reminded me I should plug it right now that

12:54.680 --> 13:01.200
you can join Alan and I for our last TechSnap episode 300 this Thursday at one o'clock

13:01.200 --> 13:06.400
JB time jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar and then the show goes on with Mr. West and

13:06.400 --> 13:08.320
Dan.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.200
So yeah I should mention that since Alan's here if you're listening you can join us for

13:11.200 --> 13:12.200
that.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.200
And thanks for joining us Alan.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.680
Yeah Alan it's good to see you.

13:14.680 --> 13:17.560
I just got back from the dentist and had nothing better to do.

13:17.560 --> 13:19.600
So hang out with those Linux guys.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.600
That's our audience folks.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.600
Got it Alan.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.600
I love it.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.600
I love it.

13:23.600 --> 13:28.520
Well you just also happen to be talking about a topic that's been of interest to me lately

13:28.520 --> 13:34.880
because I've seen a bunch of people I've known as hardcore Mac users for you know five or

13:34.880 --> 13:39.520
ten years more being like well they took away my escape key so I bought a Lenovo.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.520
Yeah right.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.880
Yeah we just had somebody in the chat room that just said that basically.

13:42.880 --> 13:48.520
In fact he said, who was it, I just yeah DeBill are you in the Mumba room DeBill?

13:48.520 --> 13:49.520
No I don't see him in the Mumba room.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.440
DeBill said that he replaced his Macbook at work for a three year old Lenovo with Linux

13:53.440 --> 13:57.160
because he got tired of it crashing and all those kind of shit.

13:57.160 --> 14:01.840
And I think that's the main reason so many Linux and BSD developers went with a Mac is

14:01.840 --> 14:07.320
because they were having these consistency and polish problems on the open source OS

14:07.320 --> 14:12.160
and a lot of that has gotten better although a lot of it is not.

14:12.160 --> 14:17.640
The thing that we haven't really caught up on is the lightness of the hardware although

14:17.640 --> 14:22.600
like the X1 carbon from Lenovo is nice and light and is getting there but you know reliable

14:22.600 --> 14:25.280
suspend resume and battery life.

14:25.280 --> 14:29.600
The Mac has always been way ahead there but maybe this will be the push to actually make

14:29.600 --> 14:32.000
people spend time on making that happen.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Yeah exactly.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.940
Yeah and I noticed I think specifically Solus and maybe elementary OS too have done something

14:37.940 --> 14:42.000
to make standby really fast and reliable on those distros because like it's with those

14:42.000 --> 14:46.360
distros my benchmark is is this is the password prompt on my screen by the time I finished

14:46.360 --> 14:47.360
lifting the lid.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.360
There you go.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.360
Yeah.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.900
And those meet that benchmark and that's as fast as I could possibly ask for.

14:51.900 --> 14:53.720
But then there's other desktops where it does.

14:53.720 --> 14:54.720
So what line before.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.880
OK so West has closed his laptop.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.680
What log in manager are you using on that you know GDM.

14:59.680 --> 15:00.680
OK.

15:00.680 --> 15:01.680
All right.

15:01.680 --> 15:02.680
So I think that seems to make a difference.

15:02.680 --> 15:03.680
All right.

15:03.680 --> 15:04.680
Fire it up.

15:04.680 --> 15:05.680
All right.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.000
Not quite about a half second after after the screen was up which is usable.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.840
It was usable but it's not as fast as a MacBook.

15:11.840 --> 15:12.840
Which is cool.

15:12.840 --> 15:13.840
Yeah.

15:13.840 --> 15:17.680
You have to see what the Mac is cheating by not doing things like erasing the full disk

15:17.680 --> 15:19.240
encryption password program.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.240
Right.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.240
Right.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.760
We covered that in last week's tech snap.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.960
It turns out that it's just sitting there in plain text in the RAM just hanging out

15:25.960 --> 15:27.520
just chilling the password.

15:27.520 --> 15:32.480
And if you plug into Thunderbolt you can DMA and yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just so

15:32.480 --> 15:33.480
just wait.

15:33.480 --> 15:37.900
So plug into the Thunderbolt port lift the Mac lid grab the RAM contents.

15:37.900 --> 15:38.900
There's the password.

15:38.900 --> 15:39.900
You don't have to.

15:39.900 --> 15:40.960
You don't have to crack nothing.

15:40.960 --> 15:41.960
That's this.

15:41.960 --> 15:42.960
And there's little devices you know.

15:42.960 --> 15:46.680
You just the Thunderbolt stuff is going to be and USBC is that's what's going to be crazy

15:46.680 --> 15:47.680
about them.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.680
We should move on.

15:48.680 --> 15:53.400
But with the MacBook specifically with those USBC ports being Thunderbolt in reality and

15:53.400 --> 15:55.720
that's right there on the bus.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.800
I wonder if that's going to become a security issue.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.480
It's going to have to be a Solus is using LightDM.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.480
Well damn.

16:01.480 --> 16:02.480
I don't know.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.480
I don't know what to tell you.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.440
Although I don't know if LightDM is specifically specifically fast or slower.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.120
I just have a lot of experience with GDM.

16:08.120 --> 16:12.160
Getting a Solus just really quick since we just put out our review.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.200
They have an update.

16:13.200 --> 16:17.760
We reviewed them on Sunday and that afternoon they put out an update and just thought I'd

16:17.760 --> 16:21.120
mention it really quick because it's sort of the distribution that I'm all excited about

16:21.120 --> 16:23.400
at the moment because that's what I just installed on my machine.

16:23.400 --> 16:28.080
I still have it sitting right here and I just checked and I got all the updates installed.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.080
Nice.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.080
Yeah.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.120
So there's just a few general improvements including a bump to the Nvidia driver.

16:33.120 --> 16:37.400
The new version of software center version 15 has gone out which includes updates and

16:37.400 --> 16:41.760
new apps that I probably would have mentioned in our review if they were in there at the

16:41.760 --> 16:43.840
time.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.000
And I guess they now are – this is like the last version of the Budgie desktop that's

16:47.000 --> 16:52.000
going out before they focus on Budgie 11 which is what a lot of the users are excited about.

16:52.000 --> 16:58.820
Also I should mention the Mate edition has been updated and it's got the new Brisk menu

16:58.820 --> 17:02.280
in it which we covered in like two weeks ago I think it was.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.760
That's going to be exciting to watch.

17:03.760 --> 17:04.760
It shipped.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.960
The first version of the Brisk menu is – gosh that was fast.

17:07.960 --> 17:08.960
That was really fast.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.000
It feels like we were just like – it was just kind of a dream.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
It was on the pipeline.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Now it's here.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.640
Now we just start the clock to see how long it shows up in other distributions because

17:16.640 --> 17:17.640
that thing is going to take off.

17:17.640 --> 17:18.640
That's for sure.

17:18.640 --> 17:22.160
Just as a quick comment like just looking at that little snapshot overview like you

17:22.160 --> 17:25.600
said like they do snapshots pretty regularly but like there is a lot of stuff in there.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.080
It's so clear how much is going on in this project.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.080
I know.

17:28.080 --> 17:29.080
I know.

17:29.080 --> 17:32.160
I don't – I feel conflicted because I feel like I could take up a half hour covering

17:32.160 --> 17:37.260
it actually to be honest with you but I don't feel like that probably would be the best

17:37.260 --> 17:38.760
use of all of the audience this time but –

17:38.760 --> 17:39.760
If you're interested go check it out.

17:39.760 --> 17:40.760
Go try it.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.760
But there is a lot.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.520
There is a lot in there for just a quick update.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.520
Yeah.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.080
So the momentum – the momentum is high with this one.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.080
Keep it up guys.

17:48.080 --> 17:53.880
Also it looks like kernel 4.8.15 as well as 13.02 OpenGL.

17:53.880 --> 17:55.600
I don't even – I didn't even – wow.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.440
I don't follow OpenGL at all anymore.

17:57.440 --> 18:02.360
I care – what I honestly was more curious and watch closer is the NVIDIA driver versions

18:02.360 --> 18:04.600
because I do like to have the later versions of that.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.920
So good job to the Solus project.

18:05.920 --> 18:08.280
So Wes you and I were chatting about this before the show today.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.440
This is kind of a nice thing for Nexus 5 phone owners.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.920
Now the Google has stopped updating it right?

18:13.920 --> 18:14.920
Didn't they stop updating it?

18:14.920 --> 18:15.920
Yes they did.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.360
No 7 for us.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.900
And then I think this year the 6P and the 5X lose support.

18:22.900 --> 18:23.900
They will.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.320
They still get security updates though.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.320
Oh.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.320
Oh.

18:27.320 --> 18:28.320
The new hotness.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.320
Okay.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.320
Yep.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.320
Boy that's pretty.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.320
I mean they almost feel still new.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.320
Yeah.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.320
I guess security updates is not the end of the world.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.320
No.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.320
Yeah.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.320
How long do they get the security updates for?

18:37.320 --> 18:38.320
Do you know?

18:38.320 --> 18:39.320
I want to say like a full year.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.320
Okay.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.320
Okay.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.480
So you get like two years probably from now if you have a 5X or a 6P.

18:43.480 --> 18:44.480
That's reasonable.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.480
Exactly.

18:45.480 --> 18:46.960
I feel like the 6P should get another year of –

18:46.960 --> 18:47.960
Yeah.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.320
It does feel like it was – that was an expensive phone.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.320
It was the last phone.

18:50.320 --> 18:51.320
Yeah.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.320
It was the last phone.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.320
Nexus 6?

18:53.320 --> 18:54.320
Yeah.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.320
It's –

18:55.320 --> 18:56.320
Yeah.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.880
Do you not get update 7 and so on?

18:57.880 --> 19:00.660
No it shouldn't be.

19:00.660 --> 19:02.580
I have the 7 update pending.

19:02.580 --> 19:03.820
I just have to press the button.

19:03.820 --> 19:04.820
Do you not get 7.1?

19:04.820 --> 19:05.820
I have no idea.

19:05.820 --> 19:06.820
You might not get 7.1.

19:06.820 --> 19:07.820
That would be –

19:07.820 --> 19:08.820
Yeah.

19:08.820 --> 19:09.820
That would be some real shit.

19:09.820 --> 19:10.820
Put you on the –

19:10.820 --> 19:11.820
Yeah.

19:11.820 --> 19:12.820
Put you on the –

19:12.820 --> 19:14.480
But you don't get the thing where we ironed out the –

19:14.480 --> 19:15.480
Yeah.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.480
That's the worst.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.920
I just don't know about that.

19:19.920 --> 19:22.480
And of course so this is a real thing.

19:22.480 --> 19:23.480
This is a real problem.

19:23.480 --> 19:30.900
And this is where I think things like Lineage or Ubuntu Touch have some real promise.

19:30.900 --> 19:33.460
The Nexus 5 is now fully working with Ubuntu Phone.

19:33.460 --> 19:38.480
So if you've got a Nexus 5, you can go all in.

19:38.480 --> 19:43.480
We've talked about Maurice's cool software that he created in the past that allows you

19:43.480 --> 19:45.720
to flash these devices super easy.

19:45.720 --> 19:46.720
So he's been working on it.

19:46.720 --> 19:50.560
He's also got an unofficial port for the Fairphone 2, which is becoming fully working, which

19:50.560 --> 19:51.560
is awesome.

19:51.560 --> 19:52.560
Hey, cool.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.160
The GPS still is not working, but otherwise it's fully working.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.160
Wow.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.160
Nexus 5, though.

19:57.160 --> 19:58.160
All in.

19:58.160 --> 20:03.480
It looks like it's working also on the 1 Plus 1 Ubuntu Touch port.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.480
Still some stabilization improvements that need to happen there, though.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.480
But wow.

20:07.480 --> 20:12.520
In fact, the developer, Maurice, is using a Nexus 5 running Ubuntu Touch as his daily

20:12.520 --> 20:13.520
driver.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.480
He even connects it to HDMI and gets the convergent stuff.

20:16.480 --> 20:17.480
Wow.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.480
That's neat.

20:18.480 --> 20:22.520
So it's full-on Nexus 5 with convergence, while Google's not even updating it anymore.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.520
Nope.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.520
That kind of makes me curious.

20:24.520 --> 20:27.440
I have one kicking around still, so I'll definitely try it on there.

20:27.440 --> 20:31.400
My mom's using a Nexus 5 still, and it makes me like, maybe I'm better off just flashing

20:31.400 --> 20:32.400
it with Ubuntu.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.200
She doesn't need a whole bunch of Android apps, so would that be a more secure, maintainable

20:36.200 --> 20:37.200
thing?

20:37.200 --> 20:38.200
I think it would.

20:38.200 --> 20:41.160
It would be really interesting to see that type of user's perspective.

20:41.160 --> 20:44.360
Also, if you check the show notes, you can get the link to the article, but you could

20:44.360 --> 20:52.040
also just go to ubports.com and learn more, which interestingly enough is powered by a

20:52.040 --> 20:53.040
DigitalOcean.

20:53.040 --> 20:57.200
Oh, digitalocean.com is our first sponsor this week.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.040
You know, DigitalOcean's awesome like that.

21:00.040 --> 21:03.560
It's not just that open source project they're hooking up, Ubiports is one of them.

21:03.560 --> 21:07.280
I think they also do support for elementary OS's back end.

21:07.280 --> 21:10.560
They're watching elementary OS's back end, yeah, you bet they're not.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.560
Oh yeah, you bet it.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.560
You bet it.

21:12.560 --> 21:13.560
You betta believe it.

21:13.560 --> 21:14.560
They know the movers and shakers.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.560
There's a few different distributions out there they're supplying infrastructure for,

21:17.560 --> 21:21.240
and remember that time Wimpy was on the show working on his releasing a version of Ubuntu

21:21.240 --> 21:22.240
Mate.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.240
He was running on DigitalOcean service.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.240
That's right.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.960
There's a reason why everybody's picking this as their infrastructure.

21:25.960 --> 21:32.280
It is so, so easy to get started, so quick to get started, and it's damn reliable.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.480
And it's super fast.

21:34.480 --> 21:35.480
Digitalocean.com.

21:35.480 --> 21:38.720
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, one word, you apply it to your account, you get a ten

21:38.720 --> 21:39.720
dollar credit.

21:39.720 --> 21:45.200
Now what's great about DigitalOcean is this super simple interface.

21:45.200 --> 21:49.520
It is like, if you were gonna ask for the best interface to manage virtual machines

21:49.520 --> 21:54.280
and data centers all over the world that use KVM for the virtualizer, Linux for the backend,

21:54.280 --> 21:57.360
and SSD for storage, and then you want to do like templates and snapshots and have an

21:57.360 --> 22:02.480
API and multiple distributions including FreeBSD to choose from, you honestly would not come

22:02.480 --> 22:03.480
up with a better idea.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.380
In fact, it's the gold standard.

22:05.380 --> 22:07.840
And you know, you've probably used some of those other cloud providers interfaces.

22:07.840 --> 22:08.840
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:08.840 --> 22:12.200
We have to configure like five or six things before you've even spun up a VM.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.440
That is not how it works at DO.

22:14.440 --> 22:16.040
Those are like designed in the 90s.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.040
I swear.

22:17.040 --> 22:20.160
Or they just scream enterprise throughout the whole thing.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.160
I swear to Linus.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.800
Those were created in the 90s.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.560
This is modern stuff.

22:25.560 --> 22:29.640
But what I think is truly awesome about DigitalOcean is I've been sitting here raving about that

22:29.640 --> 22:30.640
UI.

22:30.640 --> 22:33.040
I think that whole UI runs on their API.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.040
That's why the API is so good.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.040
It's super great.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.040
They did it right.

22:36.040 --> 22:39.840
And it also explains why it's simple and straightforward because they got to work with it themselves.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.400
I don't want to paint the answer right now.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.400
It's awesome.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.720
They got 40 gigabit connections into the hypervisors.

22:45.720 --> 22:48.120
They got data centers all over the world.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.120
They have team accounts.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.360
They have hourly pricing.

22:50.360 --> 22:55.600
You can run fantastic rigs with two gigs of RAM, two core processor, 40 gigabyte SSD,

22:55.600 --> 22:58.960
three terabytes of transfer for three cents an hour.

22:58.960 --> 22:59.960
What?

22:59.960 --> 23:00.960
What?

23:00.960 --> 23:01.960
Yeah, three cents an hour.

23:01.960 --> 23:02.960
I know.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.080
Develop locally and then deploy globally.

23:05.080 --> 23:09.240
This is a really, really slick system because you could spin up a rig when you need it.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.020
So you could be working in a Docker container.

23:11.020 --> 23:12.020
You could be working in a VM.

23:12.020 --> 23:14.400
You could be working in a jail for all I care.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.800
I don't care what you're doing.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.560
Maybe you're just running the directory in your opt folder.

23:18.560 --> 23:22.080
I'm not going to judge because when you're ready, you publish it up to DigitalOcean.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.080
You start testing on it.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.800
You get a bunch of users banging on it.

23:24.800 --> 23:28.160
It's so easy to manage the DNS, set up your SSH keys.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.160
You're going to be doing it at a boss level.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.160
DigitalOcean.com.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.640
Be like Ubiports.com and become a DigitalOcean customer.

23:34.640 --> 23:39.440
Just use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

23:39.440 --> 23:43.080
the Unplugged program and happy 2017 to DigitalOcean.

23:43.080 --> 23:47.800
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

23:47.800 --> 23:53.720
So Wes, do you have any interest in the Firefox inaugural consensus results?

23:53.720 --> 23:55.640
Oh yeah, that sounds interesting actually.

23:55.640 --> 23:58.520
I'm kind of curious who finds themselves a Firefox user these days.

23:58.520 --> 23:59.680
And I didn't even know they did this.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.680
I didn't know that either.

24:00.680 --> 24:04.120
But it makes sense when you, I mean you probably need that to help grow in the right direction.

24:04.120 --> 24:06.600
So from the fire, here we go.

24:06.600 --> 24:14.240
This is making me concerned from the Firefox department of whimsy.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.440
We get this report.

24:15.440 --> 24:19.160
This could be a bad, you know, I'm going to save it.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.160
You know what?

24:20.160 --> 24:21.160
I'll save judgment.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.160
Let's see what's happening.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.480
Because I was about to talk about having too much money and people sitting around with

24:24.480 --> 24:25.560
time on their hands.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.700
But no, I'm not going to get in there.

24:26.700 --> 24:27.700
So let's keep going.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.280
I mean you need at least two people making up department names, Chris.

24:30.280 --> 24:31.600
That's how any organization works.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.600
That's true.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.600
All right.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.600
You're right.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.600
All right.

24:35.600 --> 24:40.400
So a lot of their survey takers were between 18 and 34 years old or 55 plus.

24:40.400 --> 24:50.960
80% use a PC, 12% use a Mac, and 6.8% use GNU slash Linux, GNU slash Linux.

24:50.960 --> 24:55.840
However, a bunch of the Linux users bitched that I actually also run Windows a lot.

24:55.840 --> 24:59.200
So I sort of voted Windows, but I still have a Linux machine I run.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.240
So you should have had multi OS.

25:01.240 --> 25:02.240
Don't peg me.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.240
That's that was in there.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.240
I don't know.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.240
I don't know what that means.

25:05.240 --> 25:06.240
I don't know.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.240
Next time just pick Linux.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.240
Just pick.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.240
Yeah.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.240
I know.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.240
I know.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.240
That's what I was thinking when I read that.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.240
That's not that hard of a choice.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.920
They even they even said, by the way, anyway, I won't go into what they talk about.

25:15.920 --> 25:19.560
Speaking of our Linux folk, we found they tend to speak more languages than other OS

25:19.560 --> 25:20.560
users.

25:20.560 --> 25:26.120
58% of Linux users speak more than one language compared to 38% for Mac and Windows users.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.120
So more mold.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.120
That makes sense.

25:28.120 --> 25:33.160
Linux is, you know, those it feels like Mac OS and Windows developed for English first

25:33.160 --> 25:35.600
and then right and then.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.360
But there's other places in the world where the people are developing their own native

25:38.360 --> 25:39.840
language for open source.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.880
So and they can just run it on their desktop.

25:41.880 --> 25:45.040
A couple other things I thought were interesting.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.720
Likes for Firefox users cooking.

25:48.720 --> 25:52.640
At least 66% of good cooks, even if they don't like doing it.

25:52.640 --> 25:58.520
Fall is the favorite season by 32% and 16% for winter.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.200
And Star Wars beat Star Trek.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.040
It was a close call.

26:02.040 --> 26:03.720
Star Wars got fifty four point six percent.

26:03.720 --> 26:05.200
Star Wars on this article.

26:05.200 --> 26:06.200
Yeah.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.200
Forty five point four percent.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.200
I know.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.200
It's true for us.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.200
Dislikes.

26:10.200 --> 26:13.560
Most actors who have played Spider-Man.

26:13.560 --> 26:17.360
Fifty six percent chose no over Tobey Maguire.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.360
Bungee jumping.

26:18.360 --> 26:20.560
Sixty seven percent haven't been bungee jumping.

26:20.560 --> 26:22.000
Twenty six say they never would.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.880
Online dating they don't like.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.560
Seventy nine percent have never tried it.

26:25.560 --> 26:27.600
Nine percent said yes, they've tried it.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.080
But it's a horror show.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.480
Firefox sends their condolences.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.480
The world.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.920
Here's another thing Firefox users dislike.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.920
The word jowls.

26:38.920 --> 26:44.000
Fifty one percent said it's their least favorite word over synergy, fluid, and moist.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
That's a common one.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000
Moist.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Fluid though.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Come on.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.320
Fluid's a fun word and concept.

26:50.320 --> 26:53.600
If people didn't mind me swearing on this show, I would be swearing about this.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.080
This is what they spend their time and money on.

26:55.080 --> 26:58.240
I mean they probably didn't spend a lot of time and money on it, but still.

26:58.240 --> 27:03.880
I was hoping for like fifty six percent of Firefox users want multiprocessing.

27:03.880 --> 27:07.200
Ten percent of Firefox users know what sandbox tabs are.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.200
That's what I was hoping for.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.200
The things that people are excited about.

27:09.200 --> 27:12.680
I mean like I've been using Firefox at work and I'm always pleasantly surprised that when

27:12.680 --> 27:16.560
I have a tab open and I try to open a new tab to go to that same URL, it just pops me

27:16.560 --> 27:17.640
back to my current tab.

27:17.640 --> 27:20.900
These are things that I like about Firefox, but I don't, this survey does not tell me

27:20.900 --> 27:21.900
about that.

27:21.900 --> 27:22.900
Oh man.

27:22.900 --> 27:27.040
Oh too bad Alan had to go because this next one would be such a good update for him.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.040
I should pick up the pace.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.040
I think we're dragging.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.040
Should I pick up the pace?

27:30.040 --> 27:31.040
Let's do it.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.040
All right.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
So we'll just go through this really quick.

27:33.040 --> 27:36.080
Huge, huge, huge, huge, huge story everybody.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.880
Linux.com.

27:37.880 --> 27:40.720
How Facebook uses Linux and ButterFS.

27:40.720 --> 27:41.720
Oh man.

27:41.720 --> 27:42.720
Whoa.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.720
This is going to be great.

27:43.720 --> 27:44.720
Finally.

27:44.720 --> 27:45.720
Finally.

27:45.720 --> 27:46.720
We've been waiting for this.

27:46.720 --> 27:47.720
Finally.

27:47.720 --> 27:51.040
That pro argument that all ButterFS users always throw in my face when I say ButterFS

27:51.040 --> 27:53.480
is garbage and we should abandon it.

27:53.480 --> 27:54.480
But Chris.

27:54.480 --> 27:55.480
But Chris.

27:55.480 --> 27:56.480
Chris.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.480
Facebook.

27:57.480 --> 27:58.480
Facebook.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.480
Facebook uses it on their servers Chris.

27:59.480 --> 28:00.480
Chris.

28:00.480 --> 28:01.480
Are you better than Facebook Chris?

28:01.480 --> 28:02.480
Actually Chris.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.480
Actually.

28:03.480 --> 28:04.480
Well actually.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.980
Well actually Chris.

28:05.980 --> 28:06.980
Facebook uses ButterFS.

28:06.980 --> 28:08.720
That's what I get.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.720
Every time I get that.

28:09.720 --> 28:10.720
You've seen it.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.720
Oh yeah.

28:11.720 --> 28:12.720
Okay.

28:12.720 --> 28:13.720
Oh yeah.

28:13.720 --> 28:14.720
Okay.

28:14.720 --> 28:15.720
All right.

28:15.720 --> 28:16.720
So we have an interview.

28:16.720 --> 28:17.720
Actually.

28:17.720 --> 28:18.720
Yeah.

28:18.720 --> 28:19.720
Thank you.

28:19.720 --> 28:20.720
Thank you.

28:20.720 --> 28:21.720
Thank you.

28:21.720 --> 28:22.720
We have an interview with not just somebody who works at Facebook in the server department

28:22.720 --> 28:26.100
turns out to also be a lead developer of ButterFS.

28:26.100 --> 28:28.080
So this guy pretty familiar with the product.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.340
So let's go with what he says.

28:29.340 --> 28:30.340
So we're going to get.

28:30.340 --> 28:34.560
Now this whole article is framed around how Facebook uses ButterFS but in reality I love

28:34.560 --> 28:37.400
you Swampy but it's only two questions in an entire article.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.480
It's not about this at all.

28:39.480 --> 28:43.200
But so Swampy asks, ButterFS has been in development for a long time.

28:43.200 --> 28:44.460
Is it ready for prime time?

28:44.460 --> 28:48.320
I know some distributions are using it as a default file system while others don't.

28:48.320 --> 28:51.080
So the question is, is ButterFS ready for prime time?

28:51.080 --> 28:52.080
It's right there.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.080
Is it ready?

28:53.080 --> 28:55.160
The direct quote is, is it ready for prime time?

28:55.160 --> 29:03.720
Chris Mason's answer, it's certainly the default in Soos.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.800
Pretty strong answer there.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.920
And then he goes on talking about Soos and how Soos uses it.

29:08.920 --> 29:12.800
And then he says, Red Hat hasn't picked it up in the same way.

29:12.800 --> 29:13.800
Okay.

29:13.800 --> 29:14.800
Okay.

29:14.800 --> 29:15.800
Next question.

29:15.800 --> 29:19.420
What are the areas where ButterFS makes more sense?

29:19.420 --> 29:24.480
If I'm not wrong, Facebook also uses ButterFS?

29:24.480 --> 29:28.960
Here's all of the millions of deployments that Facebook has.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.960
It just has a couple of qualifiers.

29:30.960 --> 29:37.600
Inside of Facebook, again, we pick targeted places where we think the features of ButterFS

29:37.600 --> 29:40.000
are really beneficial to the workloads at hand.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.220
The big areas we're trying to focus on are system management tasks, the snapshotting

29:44.220 --> 29:45.220
type of things.

29:45.220 --> 29:49.840
In other words, they run it on a tiny fraction of their systems where that specific workload

29:49.840 --> 29:52.000
makes sense for ButterFS.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.520
So when you hear Facebook runs ButterFS, they run it on some of their servers.

29:56.520 --> 29:59.460
And then it's for things like, okay, well, you have snapshots for your root file system,

29:59.460 --> 30:05.580
you can do rollbacks, that kind of thing, but it's not their giant storage cluster.

30:05.580 --> 30:10.600
He also goes on to say that they use Gluster and XFS, and that they're all pretty much

30:10.600 --> 30:15.880
Linux, and that they don't really use ButterFS outside of management tasks around distributing

30:15.880 --> 30:19.100
around operating systems and updates by snapshotting features.

30:19.100 --> 30:20.240
And they like checks on the features.

30:20.240 --> 30:27.120
So they think ButterFS, and I agree, has some snapshots, checksums, copy-on-write, all things

30:27.120 --> 30:29.800
I would love, sub-volumes, all things I would love to see.

30:29.800 --> 30:30.800
Those are legitimate uses.

30:30.800 --> 30:34.360
And it's not that I don't like ButterFS, actually that's not true.

30:34.360 --> 30:35.420
I don't like ButterFS.

30:35.420 --> 30:39.400
It's a bad product, it's got a bad brand, nobody's deploying it seriously.

30:39.400 --> 30:44.240
And unfortunately, it's a jalopy, everybody knows it, unfortunately.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.640
I wish it wasn't.

30:45.640 --> 30:52.900
Because the world needs ButterFS, because ZFS isn't GPL.

30:52.900 --> 30:57.520
And I really think that's why XFS has been getting a ton of development in the last year

30:57.520 --> 30:58.520
and a half.

30:58.520 --> 31:02.080
Like the development pace on XFS is skyrocketing.

31:02.080 --> 31:08.240
And I think it really is, like they're talking about adding copy-on-write support to XFS.

31:08.240 --> 31:11.320
I really think XFS is trying to now fill that hole a little bit.

31:11.320 --> 31:15.080
And I think it kind of illustrates as well, like I know some of the things people in the

31:15.080 --> 31:18.480
XFS camp have talked about, you know, is ButterFS really wasn't designed in the way where, you

31:18.480 --> 31:22.280
know, stability, production, runnableness came first, where it wasn't going to lose

31:22.280 --> 31:23.280
your data.

31:23.280 --> 31:28.040
But I think it kind of highlights the siloed nature sometimes of kernel development, where

31:28.040 --> 31:31.920
we do have this like thriving XFS community, where it's very much trusted in production,

31:31.920 --> 31:33.960
and they're going to add some features, but they're going to do it in a way where they

31:33.960 --> 31:35.720
ensure they don't break compatibility.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.400
They're not going to break your file system.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.840
Will, go ahead.

31:39.840 --> 31:46.480
So just, it looks like in here, from what he said, pretty much all Linux, the places

31:46.480 --> 31:51.680
we're targeting is ButterFS and really management around tasks and distributing the operating

31:51.680 --> 31:52.680
system.

31:52.680 --> 31:55.400
This pretty much means if we have a server, the operating system is going to be installed

31:55.400 --> 31:56.400
on ButterFS.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.400
I didn't read it that way.

31:57.400 --> 31:58.400
I do get that.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.400
I see what you're saying.

31:59.400 --> 32:03.760
But see what he says, when he says here, where they have targeted specific work environments,

32:03.760 --> 32:07.120
that to me means that's not all of their systems.

32:07.120 --> 32:11.040
You will want the operating system to be using ButterFS and have Snapshotty and all that

32:11.040 --> 32:14.320
kind of stuff, but you don't need all of the application that they have on top, which is

32:14.320 --> 32:18.500
Facebook or whatever the database is or whatever it's the program, needs to be on the same

32:18.500 --> 32:20.840
file system because that will actually make sense.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.760
It's not needed for that.

32:22.760 --> 32:27.660
It's targeted of environment, doesn't mean the whole environment doesn't actually compensate

32:27.660 --> 32:29.600
or encompasses that part.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
All right.

32:30.600 --> 32:31.600
Okay.

32:31.600 --> 32:32.600
Fine.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.600
All right.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.820
So William, when usually we're talking about file systems, this is usually what I like

32:35.820 --> 32:41.600
to check in with you because you always tantalize me with... I can't remember the name of it

32:41.600 --> 32:42.600
right now.

32:42.600 --> 32:43.600
But it's-

32:43.600 --> 32:44.600
BcashFS, I think.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.600
Yes.

32:45.600 --> 32:46.600
Thank you.

32:46.600 --> 32:47.600
Yes, it is.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.600
It is.

32:48.600 --> 32:49.600
Can we get a little BcashFS update?

32:49.600 --> 32:50.600
How's it going?

32:50.600 --> 32:54.040
So development's still progressing at a pretty smooth pace.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.280
Encryption still hasn't landed, but there's a branch for it.

32:56.280 --> 33:00.600
A lot of work has been focusing on performance and stability recently in just the feature

33:00.600 --> 33:02.000
set that is there so far.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.480
Those are good things.

33:03.480 --> 33:08.040
Unfortunately, we don't have snapshotting yet, but checksumming works, and he's also

33:08.040 --> 33:13.600
working on multi-tiering and replication and those sorts of multi-device type features.

33:13.600 --> 33:17.120
Now, is... Okay.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.120
Is there no work being done right now on Extended 5?

33:19.120 --> 33:20.680
Is that a thing?

33:20.680 --> 33:22.320
I guess that's...

33:22.320 --> 33:23.320
I think that's a pipe dream.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.320
Yeah.

33:24.320 --> 33:25.320
All right.

33:25.320 --> 33:29.080
Also, I don't really see why you would want to port the X4 code base forward to add those

33:29.080 --> 33:30.560
type of features because it's a mess.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.560
Right.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.280
It's easier to do that kind of clean room implementation.

33:34.280 --> 33:38.520
Super quick mention, because I said I wanted to pick up the base, Kodi.

33:38.520 --> 33:39.520
Love it.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.520
Hey.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.520
One of our favorites.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.000
Seventeen is just around the corner.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.840
RC2 is out as we record this.

33:46.840 --> 33:50.720
Not much of a difference between RC2 and RC1, so if you're on RC1, don't worry.

33:50.720 --> 33:54.800
But I just wanted to give it a quick mention because it is coming down the pipe soon, and

33:54.800 --> 33:58.240
if you have a Kodi box you can test on, they could probably use the help because this is

33:58.240 --> 33:59.960
a huge release.

33:59.960 --> 34:03.760
The new theme is really what the headline feature is, the new default theme, which does

34:03.760 --> 34:04.760
look super good.

34:04.760 --> 34:05.760
You see that?

34:05.760 --> 34:06.760
It does look really nice.

34:06.760 --> 34:07.760
That looks really slick.

34:07.760 --> 34:12.040
But tons of new backend stuff, new way... I mean like everything from the PVR stuff to

34:12.040 --> 34:17.640
the video decoding stuff, add-on manager changes, all of that is worth talking... Is Mr. Tennell

34:17.640 --> 34:18.640
still in there?

34:18.640 --> 34:19.640
Mr. Tennell?

34:19.640 --> 34:20.640
Rotten.

34:20.640 --> 34:25.120
Michael, do you have any Kodi thoughts before... You're usually following Kodi pretty closely.

34:25.120 --> 34:28.080
Do you have any Kodi 17 thoughts?

34:28.080 --> 34:31.000
Is there somebody who has a few add-ons on 16, are there things maybe I'll have to worry

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
about for 17?

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Do you know any of the... Are you hip to any of that?

34:34.000 --> 34:38.520
Yeah, there's a lot of differences in 16 and 17.

34:38.520 --> 34:43.760
They're mostly appearance things, like the Krypton changes a lot of stuff for the way

34:43.760 --> 34:47.440
the theme is going to change, so it's actually changing a lot of the way the interfaces for

34:47.440 --> 34:49.760
all the different applicant add-ons work.

34:49.760 --> 34:54.160
So it's mostly transparent, you don't have to do that much, but there are some add-ons

34:54.160 --> 34:58.840
that require rewrites, but overall it's not a bad thing, it's more like they got a lot

34:58.840 --> 35:01.640
of extra features they can utilize.

35:01.640 --> 35:09.120
What I think is great is the LibreOffice, not LibreOffice, why did I say that, LibreELEC.

35:09.120 --> 35:14.160
The fork of LibreELEC is really fast-paced development with Kodi.

35:14.160 --> 35:19.480
So Krypton's not even out, and LibreELEC already has builds for the Krypton version, so the

35:19.480 --> 35:23.820
alpha builds and the beta builds are already there, whereas OpenELEC doesn't even have

35:23.820 --> 35:24.860
one yet.

35:24.860 --> 35:28.940
So it's really something I would suggest people look at if they're looking at using Kodi.

35:28.940 --> 35:32.960
So I'm going to put a link to this in the show notes if you guys want it.

35:32.960 --> 35:38.120
It's LibreELEC.tv, and their tagline is Just Enough OS for Kodi.

35:38.120 --> 35:42.040
So this is something you install, it gets you a base Kodi box, like an appliance-level

35:42.040 --> 35:46.500
OS that gets fairly close, that tracks the Kodi development fairly closely.

35:46.500 --> 35:49.880
So that's pretty cool, LibreELEC over OpenELEC, I'm going to check that out.

35:49.880 --> 35:50.880
Thank you, sir.

35:50.880 --> 35:53.480
That's cool, I'm dropping that in the show notes right now.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.480
17 is...

35:54.480 --> 35:55.480
I can't wait till it airs.

35:55.480 --> 35:56.480
Oh, I know.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.480
I can't wait till it gets out.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.480
I've been just continuously impressed with Kodi.

35:58.480 --> 35:59.480
I'm using it on...

35:59.480 --> 36:00.480
All the places you can use it.

36:00.480 --> 36:01.480
I'm using it on the Android TV.

36:01.480 --> 36:02.480
Oh, really?

36:02.480 --> 36:03.480
Yeah.

36:03.480 --> 36:04.480
I'm using it on the...

36:04.480 --> 36:05.480
I have not tried it on Android yet.

36:05.480 --> 36:06.480
Super good.

36:06.480 --> 36:07.480
It's super, super...

36:07.480 --> 36:08.480
I can't...

36:08.480 --> 36:11.040
It's got to be one of the best Android applications ever.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.040
It's just so...

36:12.040 --> 36:13.040
Wow.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.640
It's like everything you want from Kodi in an app.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.640
It's so...

36:15.640 --> 36:19.400
I mean, like, I'm sitting there browsing Zomboshare's on an Android app.

36:19.400 --> 36:20.400
It's just totally mind-blowing.

36:20.400 --> 36:23.320
Without having to go tab out to some other app or any of that.

36:23.320 --> 36:24.320
That's so great.

36:24.320 --> 36:25.320
Wow.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.520
And it can browse my local file system, too, which is good because I've got a hard drive

36:27.520 --> 36:28.520
in that thing.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.520
Ah, I tell you what.

36:29.520 --> 36:30.520
I just...

36:30.520 --> 36:31.520
I really love it on there.

36:31.520 --> 36:32.520
And it's such a...

36:32.520 --> 36:35.320
It's such a true appliance at that level.

36:35.320 --> 36:38.960
Like, we just unplug it from the wall sometimes, and it's just no big deal.

36:38.960 --> 36:39.960
It's so awesome.

36:39.960 --> 36:40.960
That's...

36:40.960 --> 36:41.960
That's amazing.

36:41.960 --> 36:42.960
Mm-hmm.

36:42.960 --> 36:43.960
Mm-hmm.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.960
I did an episode on it of the Linux Action Show for you guys.

36:45.960 --> 36:46.960
Here.

36:46.960 --> 36:47.960
Thunderbird development.

36:47.960 --> 36:51.860
So this is a question that came in from Kapi in the subreddit, and he asked, has anyone

36:51.860 --> 36:55.080
tried out Zimbr Desktop as a replacement for Thunderbird because he's worried about it

36:55.080 --> 36:56.080
dropping off?

36:56.080 --> 36:57.080
Yep.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.080
And Zimbr Desktop...

36:58.080 --> 36:59.080
Or...

36:59.080 --> 37:00.080
Well, if you like Outlook, you'll like Zimbr Desktop.

37:00.080 --> 37:02.960
That's kind of being harsh.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.160
It's better than Outlook, I guess, but...

37:05.160 --> 37:06.160
What does that even say?

37:06.160 --> 37:07.640
I want to check in with you.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.720
Are you still using LASN1 as your email client?

37:10.720 --> 37:14.000
I've kind of fallen off with LASN1.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Oh!

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Yeah.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.660
I was using it for a while, and I was enjoying it, and I liked it, but I didn't find myself

37:20.660 --> 37:22.080
using any of the pro features.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.080
I don't really...

37:23.080 --> 37:24.080
I mean, I send emails, right?

37:24.080 --> 37:27.360
I receive emails mostly, but I don't need enough.

37:27.360 --> 37:33.440
At work, we have 365, so I end up using the web interface for that anyway, so it was enough

37:33.440 --> 37:36.360
to kind of keep things in the web interface.

37:36.360 --> 37:38.080
That said, I still think it's a good project.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.080
I'm excited for what they've done.

37:39.080 --> 37:41.400
I like the way they develop things.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.520
I just don't know if I have enough of a use case.

37:43.520 --> 37:47.840
If anybody in the mobile room has thoughts on their favorite awesome mail client, tag

37:47.840 --> 37:48.840
me in the chat room.

37:48.840 --> 37:50.960
Actually, I'm still using N1.

37:50.960 --> 37:54.760
What are your thoughts?

37:54.760 --> 37:55.760
It's become invaluable.

37:55.760 --> 37:56.760
Wow.

37:56.760 --> 38:00.320
Not like I'd have to have it, but I definitely...

38:00.320 --> 38:03.920
Like when I installed Solace, I was like, oh my God, can I get N1?

38:03.920 --> 38:05.180
Oh, I can.

38:05.180 --> 38:08.760
What I really like about it is two things.

38:08.760 --> 38:14.000
I super like the fact that I can snooze emails, and I can say, alert me about this email tomorrow

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
at 6 PM.

38:15.000 --> 38:21.000
That is such a nice feature, because it helps me get away from leaving the mark as unread,

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
because like...

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
That gets messy so fast.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.000
Oh my God, dude.

38:24.000 --> 38:30.000
I wonder if it says on my phone, if I pull up the mail icon, does it say how much freaking

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
mail I have?

38:31.000 --> 38:37.380
It is an unbelievable amount of unread mail I have at this very moment, and so using what

38:37.380 --> 38:42.520
used to be a great horrible system, I suppose, of just leaving messages as unread, and then

38:42.520 --> 38:45.200
if it was unread, then I knew I needed to follow up on it.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.200
That doesn't work.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.560
You can't do that.

38:47.560 --> 38:49.440
Not when you have like a ton of email to get to.

38:49.440 --> 38:54.200
So being able to set a reminder like that is super useful, because then it goes out

38:54.200 --> 38:55.360
of my inbox.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.360
It clears out.

38:56.360 --> 38:58.120
So it looks like it's been cleared out of my inbox.

38:58.120 --> 39:01.000
Anything that can reduce the complexity of what you have to do, and it can make it easy

39:01.000 --> 39:04.320
at a glance to just be like, this is what I need to deal with now, later, I will check

39:04.320 --> 39:06.680
again and deal with what needs to be dealt with then.

39:06.680 --> 39:12.680
But the other thing I really like about it is this creepy feature that it has.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.080
Talking about the read notifications?

39:14.080 --> 39:17.880
Yeah, which is like read receipts on a whole new level.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.480
Do you have any idea how they're doing it?

39:20.480 --> 39:24.120
I assume they're shipping like a little pixel or element inside there.

39:24.120 --> 39:28.320
There's something in the email, but it seems to work even with plain text emails.

39:28.320 --> 39:30.920
But I don't know if that's true.

39:30.920 --> 39:34.800
I guess maybe everybody I email uses HTML mail, but it would have to be damn near everybody

39:34.800 --> 39:35.800
I email.

39:35.800 --> 39:39.800
So here's what it does, and it even integrates them with Gnome's notifications.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.440
So it's so fun.

39:41.440 --> 39:46.480
So I send off an email to somebody, and when they read it, instead of getting like the

39:46.480 --> 39:50.760
traditional read receipt email that you get in your email box, I get a push notification

39:50.760 --> 39:56.720
to the email client, which shows up as a Gnome notification that Wes has read my email.

39:56.720 --> 40:02.220
And I get that every time Wes opens up my emails, and it turns out, and this is really

40:02.220 --> 40:06.560
valuable for me because I like to dive into email and then get out for a while.

40:06.560 --> 40:10.720
And so I can tell if I'm having an active conversation with somebody because I can see

40:10.720 --> 40:13.960
that they're reading my emails, and then I know if I need to stay present.

40:13.960 --> 40:18.800
The other thing that's really great is if I leave n1 minimize in the background or running

40:18.800 --> 40:23.740
on like my second desktop and I'm on my main desktop, I will often see like Wes has opened

40:23.740 --> 40:25.720
up your email, blah, blah, blah, blah.

40:25.720 --> 40:30.240
Because what everybody seems to do in the entire world is instead of, when they go to

40:30.240 --> 40:33.760
email somebody, they just open up the last email from them, hit reply, clear out the

40:33.760 --> 40:36.840
subject line, put a new subject line in, clear out the body, put a new body in, and send

40:36.840 --> 40:37.840
the email.

40:37.840 --> 40:40.920
And so everybody opens up my old emails before they send me a new email, at least a lot of

40:40.920 --> 40:44.200
people, not everybody.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.860
So I end up getting a notification in like five, ten minutes that, hey, you're about

40:46.860 --> 40:48.800
to get an email from Wes.

40:48.800 --> 40:49.800
So I keep an eye out.

40:49.800 --> 40:51.920
And without fail, it always happens.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.960
Wow, actually that's pretty handy.

40:53.960 --> 40:57.640
It is very handy because otherwise, once I'm out, I'm done.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.440
It might be days until I open up my email again.

40:59.440 --> 41:01.960
You could have like, you know, you could have solved that thing or come to a resolution

41:01.960 --> 41:03.520
with a question you had right there.

41:03.520 --> 41:07.520
So that turns out to be a very super creepy, great feature.

41:07.520 --> 41:08.880
Well, maybe I'll have to give it another try.

41:08.880 --> 41:17.360
So that combined with the delay, the way you can snooze emails, and the overall UI is nice.

41:17.360 --> 41:21.120
I mean, it's an Electron app, but it's probably one of the best Electron apps I've ever used.

41:21.120 --> 41:23.120
I never found it to be slow or anything like that.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.880
And I don't mind that it has a pay structure.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.520
I'm glad the company's going to be around.

41:26.520 --> 41:29.880
And they still allow you to host your own server, which works fine on DigitalOcean.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.880
So I'm happy.

41:31.880 --> 41:32.880
Yeah.

41:32.880 --> 41:33.880
I don't disagree with that.

41:33.880 --> 41:37.840
I never want that feature ever, ever, ever.

41:37.840 --> 41:38.840
The creepy tracking?

41:38.840 --> 41:39.840
Yes.

41:39.840 --> 41:40.840
Yes.

41:40.840 --> 41:41.840
Please.

41:41.840 --> 41:42.840
No.

41:42.840 --> 41:43.840
Please.

41:43.840 --> 41:48.880
If I want to have that type of knowledge about people being about to text me, I would use

41:48.880 --> 41:51.680
an instance messaging service.

41:51.680 --> 41:52.680
There's plenty out there already.

41:52.680 --> 41:55.600
I'll make another one if you're listening to this, by the way.

41:55.600 --> 42:00.720
I should also say it has pretty great GPG integration, too.

42:00.720 --> 42:04.160
It beats even Enigma or whatever.

42:04.160 --> 42:05.160
What's the Thunderbird extension?

42:05.160 --> 42:06.160
Yeah.

42:06.160 --> 42:07.160
Enigma.

42:07.160 --> 42:08.160
There's also the...

42:08.160 --> 42:09.160
Well, Enigma...

42:09.160 --> 42:10.160
Yeah.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.160
It's good.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.160
It's fine.

42:12.160 --> 42:13.160
Yeah, it is.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.240
I like Enigma a lot, so I'm not trying to disparage it, because I also like that it

42:14.240 --> 42:15.240
has good key management.

42:15.240 --> 42:21.680
Made it easy, and it came out quickly on the time that FSF was trying to cash on the fears

42:21.680 --> 42:24.960
because of the revelations and stuff.

42:24.960 --> 42:25.960
It kind of does work.

42:25.960 --> 42:26.960
But you know what?

42:26.960 --> 42:27.960
Yes.

42:27.960 --> 42:31.240
So I just wanted to get it out there for Kipi, because N1 might be something, if you're willing

42:31.240 --> 42:34.000
to host your own server or willing to let them host it for you, because it does require

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
that server-side component.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.000
Right.

42:36.000 --> 42:40.480
And that's how the tracking works, but also sending notifications to your desktop.

42:40.480 --> 42:47.920
The other thing that's really great about it is that intermediary server seems...

42:47.920 --> 42:52.380
It just gets really shitty when you get a lot of email, and sometimes red status doesn't

42:52.380 --> 42:54.880
get synced correctly through IMAP and stuff like that.

42:54.880 --> 42:58.160
It's just a pain in the butt, and the N1 client doesn't seem to have those issues.

42:58.160 --> 42:59.440
So I like that a lot about it, too.

42:59.440 --> 43:00.900
So there you go, Kipi.

43:00.900 --> 43:03.240
That's my answer to your Thunderbird question.

43:03.240 --> 43:07.440
Now, before we go any further in the show, we really got to get to the predictions.

43:07.440 --> 43:08.560
We got to get to the predictions.

43:08.560 --> 43:09.820
That's the whole point of the show.

43:09.820 --> 43:11.240
That's got to be where we're going.

43:11.240 --> 43:12.800
So let's talk about Ting.

43:12.800 --> 43:16.320
That's our next sponsor here on the Unplugged program, and Ting is mobile service that's

43:16.320 --> 43:19.480
perfect for our audience, because it's really quite simple.

43:19.480 --> 43:23.720
If you just think about how you use your phone a little bit, you can save a ton of money.

43:23.720 --> 43:26.720
Honestly, it's not really all that bad.

43:26.720 --> 43:33.880
One of the things I've done is we have a nanny for the kids, and she has an iPhone on Ting.

43:33.880 --> 43:37.020
And I don't go like, Jenny, don't use data.

43:37.020 --> 43:38.020
Don't make phone calls.

43:38.020 --> 43:40.240
She just uses it however she wants.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.440
I don't really bother.

43:42.440 --> 43:46.040
I am the weirdo that enjoys hacking the system.

43:46.040 --> 43:53.680
I like looking at my bill and going, three phones, and I've only spent 35 bucks.

43:53.680 --> 43:54.680
That's crazy.

43:54.680 --> 43:58.400
I like that, because I know how to use Wi-Fi for phone calls and downloading podcasts.

43:58.400 --> 44:00.960
And you can get the thrill of optimization there.

44:00.960 --> 44:01.960
Yeah, I know.

44:01.960 --> 44:02.960
That's great.

44:02.960 --> 44:03.960
It's like, hey, I won a little bit.

44:03.960 --> 44:04.960
I cheated the system.

44:04.960 --> 44:05.960
That's right.

44:05.960 --> 44:06.960
I do deserve this cheeseburger.

44:06.960 --> 44:07.960
That's right.

44:07.960 --> 44:08.960
That's right.

44:08.960 --> 44:09.960
That's a good way to think about it.

44:09.960 --> 44:10.960
I do deserve a cheeseburger.

44:10.960 --> 44:11.960
You do.

44:11.960 --> 44:12.960
Right now.

44:12.960 --> 44:13.960
You sure do.

44:13.960 --> 44:14.960
Freak eye.

44:14.960 --> 44:15.960
Yeah.

44:15.960 --> 44:17.300
He deserves a cheeseburger, too.

44:17.300 --> 44:20.600
So here's what's great about Ting is your average monthly bill is like 23 bucks.

44:20.600 --> 44:25.200
That's your average device cost, like six bucks for your line, and then your usage will

44:25.200 --> 44:27.720
generally work out to about 23 bucks.

44:27.720 --> 44:28.720
It's amazing.

44:28.720 --> 44:34.000
And if you start with our URL, linux.ting.com, you get $25 in service credit, so it'll pay

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
for more than your first month.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.160
Now, if you don't have a device, you can go get one with that $25, and that's also a great

44:39.160 --> 44:40.160
way to go.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.160
They have fantastic customer service.

44:42.160 --> 44:47.840
They have CDMA and GSM networks to choose from, no contracts, no early termination fee,

44:47.840 --> 44:54.480
and they have, guess what, a really great control panel, a legit, a lit, as the YouTubers

44:54.480 --> 44:55.480
say.

44:55.480 --> 44:56.480
They have a lit control panel.

44:56.480 --> 44:57.480
Did you know that?

44:57.480 --> 44:58.480
I did not.

44:58.480 --> 44:59.480
Lit.

44:59.480 --> 45:00.480
Lit.

45:00.480 --> 45:01.480
Which I thought at first was like you're lit up.

45:01.480 --> 45:02.480
Yeah.

45:02.480 --> 45:03.480
Right.

45:03.480 --> 45:04.480
Sure.

45:04.480 --> 45:05.480
Getting lit.

45:05.480 --> 45:06.480
Yeah.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.480
Or you're getting wasted, getting lit.

45:07.480 --> 45:08.480
Yeah.

45:08.480 --> 45:09.480
I guess that's another term, getting lit, right?

45:09.480 --> 45:10.980
This is quite the overloaded operator we've got here.

45:10.980 --> 45:14.340
But no, now it's legit.

45:14.340 --> 45:15.340
Too lit to quit.

45:15.340 --> 45:16.340
Legit.

45:16.340 --> 45:17.340
Shouldn't it be le?

45:17.340 --> 45:18.520
That's le.

45:18.520 --> 45:19.520
Ting is le.

45:19.520 --> 45:20.520
It really is.

45:20.520 --> 45:22.480
I'm going on almost like what, three years with Ting?

45:22.480 --> 45:23.480
That's le.

45:23.480 --> 45:24.480
Let me tell you, that's le.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.480
That's longer than a lot of relationships.

45:25.480 --> 45:26.480
Look at you guys.

45:26.480 --> 45:27.480
Also that's le.

45:27.480 --> 45:28.480
Congratulations.

45:28.480 --> 45:29.480
I know.

45:29.480 --> 45:30.480
Me and Ting, you know what?

45:30.480 --> 45:31.800
I think it's really Kyra that makes it all work.

45:31.800 --> 45:35.120
I think Kyra behind the scenes, she's pushing all the buttons and making it possible.

45:35.120 --> 45:38.680
Without Kyra, I don't know what would be going on.

45:38.680 --> 45:42.080
Who else would explain to us how Ting works?

45:42.080 --> 45:43.080
We can't do it.

45:43.080 --> 45:44.080
We need her.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.080
No.

45:45.080 --> 45:46.080
Ting keeps rates simple.

45:46.080 --> 45:47.080
We don't make you pick a plan.

45:47.080 --> 45:49.480
Instead, you just use your phone as you normally would.

45:49.480 --> 45:52.580
How much you use determines how much you pay each month.

45:52.580 --> 45:55.420
You can have as many devices as you want on one account.

45:55.420 --> 45:59.560
That's good because when you use more, you pay less per minute, message, or megabyte

45:59.560 --> 46:00.560
of data.

46:00.560 --> 46:05.760
Your usage plus $6 per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill.

46:05.760 --> 46:06.760
Simple.

46:06.760 --> 46:10.640
That's what we mean when we say mobile.

46:10.640 --> 46:11.640
That makes sense.

46:11.640 --> 46:12.640
Yeah.

46:12.640 --> 46:19.280
Go check out their lit control panel, too, and I got an app, too, which is really nice.

46:19.280 --> 46:20.840
Sim cards for like $9.

46:20.840 --> 46:25.220
Put them in a device, security system, anything like that.

46:25.220 --> 46:27.360
I think you know what?

46:27.360 --> 46:29.800
I just got a really interesting idea.

46:29.800 --> 46:33.680
I would love to be able to check the battery status of LadyJuice remotely.

46:33.680 --> 46:37.840
I wonder if there's a little way I could hook up an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi and a little

46:37.840 --> 46:38.840
Ting.

46:38.840 --> 46:39.840
I'm sure you could.

46:39.840 --> 46:45.040
It wouldn't be great if I could SSH into something and get the battery level.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.040
Yes.

46:46.040 --> 46:47.040
That would be great.

46:47.040 --> 46:49.120
Maybe turn the car on remotely.

46:49.120 --> 46:50.120
Yeah.

46:50.120 --> 46:51.120
All right.

46:51.120 --> 46:52.120
All right.

46:52.120 --> 46:53.120
All right.

46:53.120 --> 46:54.120
You know what I can do?

46:54.120 --> 46:55.120
Let me try this.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.760
I'm not sure if this is the right command.

46:56.760 --> 47:01.760
Alexa, ask automatic how much gas I have.

47:01.760 --> 47:05.840
Your Ford Super Duty F53 motor home is 80% full.

47:05.840 --> 47:09.680
Your RAM 1500 is 72% full.

47:09.680 --> 47:10.680
Isn't that great?

47:10.680 --> 47:11.680
Wow.

47:11.680 --> 47:12.680
Yeah.

47:12.680 --> 47:13.680
We're going to get into that more later.

47:13.680 --> 47:18.760
Let's start with our 2017 predictions.

47:18.760 --> 47:21.580
I don't know what it is this year.

47:21.580 --> 47:26.840
This year, I feel like it's going to be the year of more of the same.

47:26.840 --> 47:31.440
What do I get excited about if it's more momentum in the right direction?

47:31.440 --> 47:32.720
We're going to have some fights.

47:32.720 --> 47:37.040
We're going to have some missteps, but overall, we're going to do pretty good.

47:37.040 --> 47:41.720
Maybe that means for all the negative 2016 comments, maybe it really wasn't a bad year

47:41.720 --> 47:42.720
for Linux at all.

47:42.720 --> 47:43.720
Yeah.

47:43.720 --> 47:44.720
I don't know about that.

47:44.720 --> 47:45.720
I don't know.

47:45.720 --> 47:46.720
I don't know.

47:46.720 --> 47:47.720
No.

47:47.720 --> 47:48.720
No.

47:48.720 --> 47:50.280
Freck Labs is not saying it's 1500% full.

47:50.280 --> 47:54.520
There's two different vehicles listed there, one motor home, one truck.

47:54.520 --> 47:57.760
So I want to defer to the virtual lug.

47:57.760 --> 47:59.640
Maybe they can get us going.

47:59.640 --> 48:00.640
Maybe they can get us.

48:00.640 --> 48:02.120
Do you have a quick one off the tip of your tongue?

48:02.120 --> 48:03.200
Well, we kind of already talked about it.

48:03.200 --> 48:06.720
I was just thinking at the end, we'll see BcashFS.

48:06.720 --> 48:11.320
I think by the end of 2017, that's going to be something that we will be talking about

48:11.320 --> 48:12.320
more.

48:12.320 --> 48:13.320
Interesting.

48:13.320 --> 48:14.320
I wonder if he just told Williams.

48:14.320 --> 48:15.320
All right.

48:15.320 --> 48:16.320
Sweetloo, what is your...

48:16.320 --> 48:17.320
Go ahead.

48:17.320 --> 48:18.320
You'll get first.

48:18.320 --> 48:19.320
Go.

48:19.320 --> 48:25.680
Well, I still hold on to my prediction about Ubuntu and Microsoft merging when Ubuntu reaches

48:25.680 --> 48:29.320
the end of the alphabet on this coming April.

48:29.320 --> 48:30.880
I'm going to keep track of this.

48:30.880 --> 48:31.880
I'm going to keep track of this.

48:31.880 --> 48:38.600
So Sweetloo's prediction is really what you're...are you really saying that Microsoft buys Canonical?

48:38.600 --> 48:39.600
Is that what you're saying?

48:39.600 --> 48:41.600
Yeah, either that or merges with...

48:41.600 --> 48:44.560
Yeah, it's going to be an acquisition, right?

48:44.560 --> 48:45.560
Not happening.

48:45.560 --> 48:46.560
All right.

48:46.560 --> 48:47.560
All right.

48:47.560 --> 48:48.560
So and then...

48:48.560 --> 48:49.560
All right.

48:49.560 --> 48:50.560
Hold on.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.560
I got to write this down.

48:51.560 --> 48:52.560
So that's not...

48:52.560 --> 48:53.560
Microsoft...

48:53.560 --> 48:54.560
Okay, go ahead.

48:54.560 --> 49:00.440
May make a deal with Canonical or actually more likely with Suze to be honest, though,

49:00.440 --> 49:02.880
because it's the previous deal.

49:02.880 --> 49:10.000
To have them help them support a Linux kernel, I don't believe they will acquire Canonical.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Is it like an Ubuntu...

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
Not now.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.220
It's like an Ubuntu blast kernel running on Azure?

49:15.220 --> 49:20.920
Not just that, but also because remember my prediction, we're ever closer to the year

49:20.920 --> 49:27.440
of my prediction of Microsoft running with Linux kernel and a Windows desktop environment

49:27.440 --> 49:28.440
on top that is proprietary.

49:28.440 --> 49:29.440
God, I would love that.

49:29.440 --> 49:31.840
Yeah, but I just think they're so allergic to the GPL.

49:31.840 --> 49:32.840
I think they're...

49:32.840 --> 49:33.840
They're not, though.

49:33.840 --> 49:34.840
They're not.

49:34.840 --> 49:37.640
This is the thing that they've been realizing is that it's actually useful to have other

49:37.640 --> 49:42.560
people maintain your stuff and you will not ever have the issue of not having people to

49:42.560 --> 49:45.720
hire to fix your stuff because everybody knows it.

49:45.720 --> 49:52.240
That's logical and very cognizant, but do you think they've actually made that big of

49:52.240 --> 49:53.240
a change?

49:53.240 --> 49:54.240
Yeah.

49:54.240 --> 49:55.240
Yes.

49:55.240 --> 50:03.200
Because look at the companies, I just can't not look at the fact that they've been acquiring

50:03.200 --> 50:07.640
talent more with the acquisitions of the apps companies and so on.

50:07.640 --> 50:11.360
They're not acquiring just the companies, they're acquiring talent that knows how to

50:11.360 --> 50:16.280
work in this platform without telling the world that they're doing so.

50:16.280 --> 50:19.720
Right now, if you want to look at the prospects of any business in IT and you want to know

50:19.720 --> 50:22.340
what they're up to, there's two ways.

50:22.340 --> 50:25.840
You can ask them and they might say about it or you can look at what they're hiring

50:25.840 --> 50:29.240
because they can't lie about the hiring because otherwise they'll not get the right people.

50:29.240 --> 50:33.640
So do you want to go on record and say that you're going to see Microsoft products running

50:33.640 --> 50:38.680
on an Ubuntu kernel or do you want to actually say Windows because I could actually get behind

50:38.680 --> 50:39.680
the first one.

50:39.680 --> 50:43.640
I don't know if I could get behind Windows in 2017.

50:43.640 --> 50:50.000
I'm not sure if it will be in 2017, but until 2018, I'm pretty sure there will be a Linux

50:50.000 --> 50:52.160
kernel with a Windows desktop environment.

50:52.160 --> 50:53.160
I think-

50:53.160 --> 50:54.160
That was my prediction.

50:54.160 --> 50:55.160
It was a five-year span.

50:55.160 --> 50:56.160
They're three years in.

50:56.160 --> 51:00.640
They already have a Linux distribution on the server and Azure and all the stuff.

51:00.640 --> 51:04.160
They love Linux now.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.160
Here's what I'm going to say.

51:05.160 --> 51:09.920
I'm going to kind of hijack your prediction a bit and I'm going to say in 2017, Microsoft

51:09.920 --> 51:13.640
makes a deal with Canonical to run a product on an Ubuntu blessed kernel.

51:13.640 --> 51:19.800
And it might be like the more like the slimmed down Ubuntu stuff, like Ubuntu core.

51:19.800 --> 51:21.600
I could totally see that.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.920
I could see them doing that on the cloud.

51:23.920 --> 51:27.240
I could even see them doing that in like a product.

51:27.240 --> 51:32.000
I really could see that happening, but running their core Windows desktop, I've always thought

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
eventually to go on a VM, but I figured it'd be because it'd be replaced with another Microsoft

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
product.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Right.

51:38.000 --> 51:43.200
And it seems like I could see them doing that on a BSD or something, but I feel like they're

51:43.200 --> 51:47.280
always going to want to withhold that to be able to have their new proprietary drivers,

51:47.280 --> 51:51.360
their new custom kernel integration that lets them have the one new feature or the HoloLens

51:51.360 --> 51:54.440
support or something where they have a competitive edge in the business.

51:54.440 --> 51:57.920
And I don't think, I think there are still enough things at the OS level for the desktop

51:57.920 --> 51:59.440
world that they wouldn't be willing to share that.

51:59.440 --> 52:03.880
On the cloud server angle, yes, I think that's a different ball game for them.

52:03.880 --> 52:06.400
I think you're on the same page.

52:06.400 --> 52:12.240
To be honest, it won't matter that much the feature of Microsoft and like in general what

52:12.240 --> 52:18.120
OS you're running because they're really moving to the assistant world, want to give you Windows

52:18.120 --> 52:19.120
10 for free.

52:19.120 --> 52:20.120
Why?

52:20.120 --> 52:21.120
Because it doesn't matter.

52:21.120 --> 52:25.220
You're going to profit on having you talk with Cortana.

52:25.220 --> 52:29.440
This is the thing that actually is dragging people still to Windows 10 and try and they

52:29.440 --> 52:32.080
were excited about the experimentation.

52:32.080 --> 52:35.880
You can run Cortana everywhere, even in your Android phone.

52:35.880 --> 52:40.280
Alexa, what do you think of Cortana?

52:40.280 --> 52:41.280
I like all AIs.

52:41.280 --> 52:42.280
Yeah.

52:42.280 --> 52:43.280
She's pretty nice.

52:43.280 --> 52:44.280
Fires.

52:44.280 --> 52:45.280
Yeah.

52:45.280 --> 52:47.980
So producer Michael, I would love to hear your predictions.

52:47.980 --> 52:48.980
You wanted to jump in.

52:48.980 --> 52:49.980
Go ahead.

52:49.980 --> 52:50.980
Yeah.

52:50.980 --> 52:55.480
One of my predictions is I think SNAPs will make a big leap forward ahead of everything

52:55.480 --> 52:56.480
else.

52:56.480 --> 52:57.480
Oh, yeah.

52:57.480 --> 52:58.480
So it's the year of SNAPs, huh?

52:58.480 --> 52:59.480
Yeah.

52:59.480 --> 53:04.800
I think the SNAPs are already on the track record of becoming the more standardized way

53:04.800 --> 53:09.880
of deployment, but I think this year they're going to set themselves apart way farther

53:09.880 --> 53:14.760
than 5X or App Images could be close to catching up.

53:14.760 --> 53:18.960
I think that won't happen until the end of the year, but I think it'll happen.

53:18.960 --> 53:23.800
I think 1710 will probably offer a Unity 8 by default.

53:23.800 --> 53:24.800
Oh.

53:24.800 --> 53:25.800
Okay.

53:25.800 --> 53:26.800
All right.

53:26.800 --> 53:27.800
So that's two right there.

53:27.800 --> 53:28.800
I'm going to mark you down for it.

53:28.800 --> 53:29.800
So 1710, Unity by default.

53:29.800 --> 53:30.800
Unity.

53:30.800 --> 53:31.800
You mean, you mean Unity 8 by default.

53:31.800 --> 53:32.800
Unity 8.

53:32.800 --> 53:33.800
Yeah.

53:33.800 --> 53:34.800
I meant Unity 8.

53:34.800 --> 53:35.800
Yeah.

53:35.800 --> 53:36.800
Okay.

53:36.800 --> 53:37.800
QT switch and stuff.

53:37.800 --> 53:38.800
Ooh.

53:38.800 --> 53:39.800
Ooh.

53:39.800 --> 53:40.800
Oh.

53:40.800 --> 53:41.800
All right.

53:41.800 --> 53:42.800
All right.

53:42.800 --> 53:43.800
All right, Double.

53:43.800 --> 53:44.800
You got two predictions for us.

53:44.800 --> 53:45.800
Go.

53:45.800 --> 53:46.800
I do.

53:46.800 --> 53:52.880
One is we're finally getting a proper KMS support as well as the right Wayland support.

53:52.880 --> 53:53.880
Okay.

53:53.880 --> 53:55.880
I'm down with that.

53:55.880 --> 54:00.760
The second is Solus is going to become more popular and will eventually come out with

54:00.760 --> 54:06.680
a AUR type solution similar to Arch where you can, you know, the community can maintain

54:06.680 --> 54:09.200
build scripts for separate packages.

54:09.200 --> 54:10.760
I get to see that.

54:10.760 --> 54:14.480
So it's like a Solus AUR equivalent.

54:14.480 --> 54:18.960
I'm going to vote for, I'm going to, my prediction is that doesn't happen.

54:18.960 --> 54:19.960
Yeah.

54:19.960 --> 54:20.960
Okay.

54:20.960 --> 54:21.960
Yeah.

54:21.960 --> 54:22.960
Here's the thing.

54:22.960 --> 54:23.960
Solus is anti AUR, anti other people's packages.

54:23.960 --> 54:24.960
Yeah.

54:24.960 --> 54:25.960
Yeah.

54:25.960 --> 54:28.320
I've already tried to make my own packages with them and they've already told me nah-uh.

54:28.320 --> 54:29.320
Yeah.

54:29.320 --> 54:30.320
Yeah.

54:30.320 --> 54:31.320
Yeah.

54:31.320 --> 54:32.320
Yeah.

54:32.320 --> 54:35.800
So I've done this too with Solus and the thing is if you go to install an application that

54:35.800 --> 54:40.040
doesn't support Solus, like you don't have the advantage of a dev or an RPM install.

54:40.040 --> 54:44.480
So you go into EO package and you copy a couple make files, you create a script, it starts

54:44.480 --> 54:48.380
downloading the source and you go through this rigmarole to get one thing installed.

54:48.380 --> 54:50.960
What people are doing is posting those to the Wiki.

54:50.960 --> 54:54.160
So the Wiki is starting to contain more and more of this third party and I think as they

54:54.160 --> 54:57.860
gain popularity, they're not going to be able to keep up and so they're going to have the

54:57.860 --> 55:01.160
ability for you to actually compile them, but it's not going to be part of the main

55:01.160 --> 55:02.160
repo.

55:02.160 --> 55:03.160
Yeah.

55:03.160 --> 55:06.240
I think that this is the possibility of happening, but I don't think it'll be Solus back.

55:06.240 --> 55:09.280
Solus will not like endorse it or anything.

55:09.280 --> 55:15.360
There won't be an SUR and my main reason is because I'm an official maintainer of a package

55:15.360 --> 55:19.560
for like the official upstream and they still wouldn't let me control the package in the

55:19.560 --> 55:20.560
thing.

55:20.560 --> 55:21.560
Yeah, but you just named it, dude.

55:21.560 --> 55:23.120
The SUR is good.

55:23.120 --> 55:24.120
I like that.

55:24.120 --> 55:25.120
That's good.

55:25.120 --> 55:26.120
You're welcome, sir.

55:26.120 --> 55:27.120
Yeah.

55:27.120 --> 55:28.120
I think there's something wrong with that.

55:28.120 --> 55:30.760
I don't know so much about NVIDIA getting Wayland support this year.

55:30.760 --> 55:32.880
I would say maybe beta support.

55:32.880 --> 55:35.280
I don't know about, I don't know.

55:35.280 --> 55:36.280
Oh, sorry, Wes.

55:36.280 --> 55:38.240
I was stepping on your pedal, Wes.

55:38.240 --> 55:41.320
At the end of the year maybe, you know, you start seeing the, yeah, some of the, like

55:41.320 --> 55:43.680
if you install some of the beta drivers or something that starts working.

55:43.680 --> 55:44.680
Yes, exactly.

55:44.680 --> 55:45.680
That's what I was thinking.

55:45.680 --> 55:46.680
But it's not like the default, it's not shipped in the...

55:46.680 --> 55:47.680
Yeah.

55:47.680 --> 55:50.800
And it won't be like the unbelievably great performance that we want or something yet.

55:50.800 --> 55:51.800
But I don't know.

55:51.800 --> 55:52.800
But maybe you're right, Double.

55:52.800 --> 55:55.840
Maybe they'll, they should, right?

55:55.840 --> 55:56.840
Here's the thing.

55:56.840 --> 55:58.560
It's not like they haven't seen it coming.

55:58.560 --> 56:04.760
We've been, Wayland has got to be the slowest moving train coming at you and it's like there's,

56:04.760 --> 56:08.080
if you don't see the Wayland train coming, then you're not looking.

56:08.080 --> 56:09.080
You are not looking.

56:09.080 --> 56:10.080
You've had like, what?

56:10.080 --> 56:12.520
Like four years now of gradual buildup?

56:12.520 --> 56:13.520
Yeah.

56:13.520 --> 56:14.520
That's ridiculous.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.520
All right.

56:15.520 --> 56:20.680
Anybody else in there want to toss into the mix a prediction for Linux in 2017?

56:20.680 --> 56:22.160
Hmm.

56:22.160 --> 56:23.680
Really?

56:23.680 --> 56:24.680
Nobody else has anything else?

56:24.680 --> 56:25.680
No?

56:25.680 --> 56:26.680
Nobody else?

56:26.680 --> 56:27.680
It's not going to be the year of the desktop.

56:27.680 --> 56:28.680
No?

56:28.680 --> 56:29.680
Linux desktop.

56:29.680 --> 56:30.680
Is there ever going to be a year?

56:30.680 --> 56:31.680
I'm not surprised at that at all.

56:31.680 --> 56:32.680
Will there ever be?

56:32.680 --> 56:33.680
I don't think so.

56:33.680 --> 56:34.680
Yeah.

56:34.680 --> 56:35.680
It depends on your perspective.

56:35.680 --> 56:39.280
If you want to talk about Linux in general, Chrome OS already kind of did that.

56:39.280 --> 56:44.960
A little birdie tells me from the Solus project that there's no way in hell the AUR is happening.

56:44.960 --> 56:51.440
I'm not going to, no, no, they say, no, no AUR free, no SUR, which is too bad.

56:51.440 --> 56:52.880
Can we make wishes too?

56:52.880 --> 56:58.000
I do agree that Solus will become even more popular than it has been before.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.000
Yeah.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.000
Yeah.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.000
I think so too.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
So the predictions, can we make wishes?

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Oh, I'd love to hear it.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Yeah.

57:04.000 --> 57:10.200
I just, I just wish that we have one either in a Google play store, like it's something

57:10.200 --> 57:11.840
that is just across all OSs.

57:11.840 --> 57:18.200
It actually is able to, if the app has compatibility with your multiple OSs, install it, please.

57:18.200 --> 57:19.200
Yeah.

57:19.200 --> 57:20.200
Yeah.

57:20.200 --> 57:25.540
Rekai says, if you're looking for crazy predictions, maybe 2017 will finally be the year KDE cleans

57:25.540 --> 57:27.040
up its mess of settings.

57:27.040 --> 57:28.040
Ouch.

57:28.040 --> 57:29.040
Wow.

57:29.040 --> 57:30.040
Wow.

57:30.040 --> 57:31.040
I don't know.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.040
How dare you, sir.

57:32.040 --> 57:36.000
But then how, where, what will we have that the windows users will be comfortable with?

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
Wait, where's the refuge?

57:39.000 --> 57:40.640
Yeah.

57:40.640 --> 57:44.520
I still feel like I don't have like, I don't have my like succinct prediction.

57:44.520 --> 57:49.280
I feel like I have good commentary on other people's predictions.

57:49.280 --> 57:50.280
Go ahead, Delby.

57:50.280 --> 57:51.840
You can jump in again.

57:51.840 --> 57:58.740
So I wonder if at the end of 2017, we'll look back at the 2016 MacBook Pro release and basically

57:58.740 --> 58:03.440
realize that a lot of developers have switched over to Linux and the wish and the wonder

58:03.440 --> 58:08.440
is going to be what gains we see on the Linux desktop from that.

58:08.440 --> 58:14.760
Do you think it's possible Apple could hustle and crap out another MacBook in like June

58:14.760 --> 58:16.360
that is 32 gigs of RAM?

58:16.360 --> 58:18.200
Do you think that could happen?

58:18.200 --> 58:22.240
Or are they just like, or do you think they're up there in their Johnny Ive white towers

58:22.240 --> 58:23.880
going, I don't know what the problem is.

58:23.880 --> 58:25.000
This is a really powerful machine.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.000
It's great.

58:26.000 --> 58:27.000
They just need to figure it out.

58:27.000 --> 58:31.000
I don't think that's going to happen now that they rely on common people to just get their

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
stuff.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.520
They don't care anymore to make it really high tech.

58:34.520 --> 58:35.520
Mass consumer.

58:35.520 --> 58:36.520
Yeah.

58:36.520 --> 58:37.520
Yeah.

58:37.520 --> 58:39.560
I was about to say, I don't think they're worried about like, what's the problem.

58:39.560 --> 58:41.360
I think they're like, there's no problem.

58:41.360 --> 58:42.360
Yeah.

58:42.360 --> 58:46.200
I wonder if that ties into that, their IBM partnership and stuff, because it seems like

58:46.200 --> 58:49.520
some enterprises make Mac works, but it also is particularly a pain point.

58:49.520 --> 58:51.720
So maybe this is a sphere they exit.

58:51.720 --> 58:57.240
You know, you think, you know, you think that they, they think that you think it's a problem,

58:57.240 --> 58:58.240
you know, or whatever.

58:58.240 --> 59:01.320
A lot of people think it's a problem, but remember, they think different.

59:01.320 --> 59:03.120
Oh boy.

59:03.120 --> 59:09.280
I think, you know, what's weird is my, my thoughts around Linux in 2017, oddly a Microsoft,

59:09.280 --> 59:11.160
the name Microsoft keeps popping up.

59:11.160 --> 59:12.160
I keep there.

59:12.160 --> 59:13.160
It's, which feels strange.

59:13.160 --> 59:14.160
It's weird.

59:14.160 --> 59:15.160
It's weird.

59:15.160 --> 59:18.320
And it's, I wonder if it's, I mean, if they continue that trend, that's, that'll be, that'll

59:18.320 --> 59:19.640
be noteworthy for sure.

59:19.640 --> 59:23.320
And it's, I think it's going to be, I think I'm going to, I'll wait.

59:23.320 --> 59:24.320
I guess I'll wait for last.

59:24.320 --> 59:28.360
But I think, I think we're going to be surprised by Microsoft in 2017.

59:28.360 --> 59:31.680
And I think, I think we're, we're probably all sort of settled on the fact that distributions

59:31.680 --> 59:36.480
like Solace and those others are getting more important than ever, but there's other distributions

59:36.480 --> 59:38.960
over 2016 that I think turned it around.

59:38.960 --> 59:40.480
And I don't know if that gets enough attention either.

59:40.480 --> 59:43.480
And I think OpenSUSE is one of them to a degree.

59:43.480 --> 59:45.760
I think it turned it around from a distribution.

59:45.760 --> 59:48.560
I don't know if it's still, it's not quite, I don't know if it's gotten there yet, but

59:48.560 --> 59:55.040
I, I guess it feels like it's not quite yet a distribution that's changing the conversation,

59:55.040 --> 59:59.480
that's influencing the conversation, quote unquote, but it's one that's getting a whole

59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.320
new tidal wave of excited users.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:06.360
Like, so they're doing things right as a project that's appealing to a lot of, a lot more people

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.360
than they were, say, at the beginning of 2016.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.360
Right.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.200
And they're kind of on the, that like starting point of the curve where it's like they're

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.200
doing a lot of cool things.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.200
They have some good, interesting ideas.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.480
And so yeah, maybe 2017 will be the year where we see like, do people flock there?

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.480
No, we don't know.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:21.520
But it could be a great, 2017 might end up being a great year for OpenSUSE.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.520
Yeah.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.120
The 2015 was when they first announced, it was like November, 2015 when they started

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.920
doing this whole new thing.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.200
So there's only been a year of this massive change.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:35.080
So I think there hasn't been enough time for them to actually like kind of develop the

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.520
curve completely yet.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:43.240
And now, now I think you're right, that 2017 will be a much, much more OpenSUSE friendly.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.240
Unless they screw it up.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.120
I mean, I think they're pretty much, they're pretty positionable to do well.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.920
Wecom, you want to jump in with a.NET one.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.280
All right, go for it.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.800
I could see.NET becoming a native.NET support for the desktop.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.800
Oh really?

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.800
For Linux.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:57.800
Why do you say that?

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:03.960
I think Microsoft has enough third party applications that if programmers could use their.NET languages

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:09.660
and just port them to Linux, you would see a lot more, people wouldn't be threatening

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:13.680
to move to different applications or different programming languages, which is a big problem

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:14.680
for them.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:20.240
So if they could install a.NET application on a Linux desktop, it solves the migration

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.240
of.NET programmers away from Visual Studio.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:27.120
You mean it helps Windows desktop become a reality on Linux.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.120
I get it.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:32.760
I don't know if it helps Windows desktop, but I think what it helps is Windows applications,

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:37.000
Outlook per se, or business applications where people want to run them natively.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Yeah.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Or third party developers.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Yeah.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.160
People that write in.NET, they can now run it in Linux.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:48.120
Yeah, Daredevil, they could use that for the.NET, they could release the.NET VM bridge

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.120
from your Linux desktop to the Windows VM.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120
That's good ones guys.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.040
So here's what I got.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:59.200
So Sweetloot says that Microsoft will make a deal or buy Canonical, Daredevil says that

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:04.340
Microsoft makes a deal to run a product on Ubuntu blessed kernel or maybe even Windows

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:09.320
in 2018, which we probably would start hearing about in 2017.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.600
I'm going to actually, mine is, I have a similar prediction along the same lines, just a little

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.880
more, a little more less ambitious.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.000
Rotten says it's going to be the year of snaps, they're just basically going to pull ahead

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.200
by a pretty good margin.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.600
And at 1710, Unity by default, Mr. Double says that NVIDIA gets Wayland support and

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:29.480
Solus will have an SUR equivalent.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.680
And Monkeycom says.NET becomes a mainstream Linux language.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.160
I got one last thing to throw in there.

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.160
Throw it in there, Mr. West.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.180
Doesn't make me happy to say, but I feel like at least, I think we're going to be talking

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:44.200
about Linux Mint in a less than positive way at least one time this year.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.200
You know, interesting.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:50.000
I don't know if that'll be another security breach or just relevance issues.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
It's not that I don't like the project.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.760
I just think that seems like something on the horizon.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.440
It feels like there is some direction and momentum that way.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.720
And over the holiday break, I was seeing a lot of threads, and I don't think anybody

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:04.400
in the Mumble Room saw this, I've seen a lot of threads about potentially Linux Mint was

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.400
compromised again.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.400
Did you see that?

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400
No, I didn't.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.400
Did you see any of this?

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.400
I saw someone asking the question about it, but it wasn't really.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:11.400
In a few Reddits, yeah.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.600
Well, what happened was, is somebody posted and slash pwned, hey, I just owned Linux Mint

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.600
again.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.800
And then in all the other subreddits, people were asking if it was true or not.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.800
Trying to validate, yeah.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.800
Yeah.

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.480
So no word there, though.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.800
Second time I have seen something like that since the initial break-in, though.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.360
And I hope that prediction is wrong, honestly.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.360
I really do.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360
But we'll see.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.360
Yeah.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.360
Hmm.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.840
Well, I mean, I just want Mint to stop doing the terrible decisions they do.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:41.480
I can give you one example that they should stop right now.

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.480
Lay it on me, brah.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.480
Which is incredibly stupid.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.480
Brah, lay it on me.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:48.280
The priority structure that they make their repo higher priority than PPAs.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.280
Yeah.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.280
They need to stop that.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:52.800
If it's FUD, if it's FUD, why is this happening?

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:54.160
What kind of FUD is this?

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.320
And who's behind it?

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.320
You're telling me that just somebody-

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.900
Canonical might be behind it.

01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:58.900
Come on.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:59.900
Joking.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:00.900
Come on.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:01.900
Do I have to have my conspiracy bacon clip here?

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:02.900
It spread pretty fast on Reddit.

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:03.900
So maybe that's the part that's-

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:04.900
Because I think the reason-

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:05.900
That particular thing.

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:12.000
Although the problem that they had was so easily avoidable that they should have never

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.280
had the problem in the first place.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.280
True.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.800
And it meant that anything can happen at this point.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.200
Like who's to say that they realized their problem the first time and like because they

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:25.520
should have never had that problem because what they claimed was the whole meant that

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:31.080
they didn't update their WordPress for three years.

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.040
That's just stupid.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.320
That's literally painting a target on your back.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.320
Exactly.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:39.840
And it's also an easy target because there's a plethora of holes for it.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:40.840
That has got to be the-

01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:41.840
That is-

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:42.840
Yeah.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:43.840
You know, it is Reddit.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.840
Who knows?

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.840
Yeah.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.840
Okay.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.840
Well, that part, yeah.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:48.840
I mean, the current one is totally probably-

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:49.840
I mean, I don't know.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.840
Could be.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.840
Could be not.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840
I mean, I don't know.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.840
It seems to be garbage.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:54.840
Probably.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:55.840
Like just not true at all.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:56.840
I don't like it.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:57.840
It just makes me the whole-

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.320
So that is a thought-provoking prediction to end on there, Wes.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.320
I like that one.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.320
You know what else is thought-provoking?

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.640
Getting an education, linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.720
Go there, sign up for a seven-day free trial, and try out Linux Academy, a platform built

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.680
by Linux enthusiasts and educators and developers that came together to create the Linux Academy.

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:17.440
They wanted to create content that Linux users could zoom to learn more, to spread Linux

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.560
and to help you get a job, get a raise.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.480
In fact, a lot of new features they've launched to the platform really enable these goals,

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:28.920
like public profiles to show your accomplishments, core schedulers to match a busy workday, mobile

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:33.200
apps for iOS and Android so that way you can practice on the go, which would be so awesome

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.480
like on the bus or on the train or sitting on the turlet.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.480
Up your skill game while you're just wasting time otherwise.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.840
I had an uncle that would seriously take a two-hour crap, really.

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.760
And I tell you what, if I had Linux Academy on my tablet-

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.760
You would too.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.040
That would be a very productive two hours, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.480
One of the things I think is really great about Linux Academy, it sets them apart from

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.580
everybody else, is instructor mentoring.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:57.440
Because these topics, they're not fixing the sink.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.880
They're not something where they could have somebody with a cell phone on call when you

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.280
have a question like that.

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.920
These are dedicated staff members that have to really understand this stuff.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:06.920
It's a business.

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.920
They know what they're doing.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.800
You know, they've been really good at adding new content and updating old content too.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.120
And that is also something else that sets them apart.

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.820
Plus they have these labs, these hands-on scenarios where you get real world experience.

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:20.720
If you just need to get some certs, they've got great courseware for that.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:23.800
They have study tools that you can download, comprehensive guides that you can look and

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:27.120
print out and listen to for audio.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:31.200
Seriously people listen in the shower, I can't even believe it.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.440
I mean, actually, shower thoughts are real, man.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:36.540
That's a real thing.

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:40.920
So why not, if I can have brilliant shower thoughts, maybe it is the perfect time to

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.920
learn actually.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.480
I think about it.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.480
It's shower thought time.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.040
You can check it out.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.920
Also, just a real quick thing.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:52.280
If you've already subscribed to Linux Academy, you've got like just a couple of days left.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.680
We were on break so I couldn't mention this sooner.

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.320
But if you're listening live or you're downloading like day after the next day, they're giving

01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.320
away a pixel.

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.320
What?

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:01.320
Yeah.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:02.320
Yeah.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.320
It ends on January 5th.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.680
They'll do this from time to time.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:06.240
So it's just good for you to watch.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.000
They have a blog where you can watch these things.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
You just got to log into your account and help spread the word.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.480
Well, they got it all on their blog.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:14.600
They just go to their Linux Academy blog and learn, but you got a couple of days left to

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:15.600
get a pixel.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.400
And Wes, would you recommend it now?

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.400
How many?

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.400
What are you like, what, one month?

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.400
Two months into it?

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.400
What do you want?

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.400
Yeah.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.400
Probably like two, almost three months probably.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.400
Are you loving it?

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.400
Hating it?

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.400
Caveat.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:28.920
I'm not a person who, my whole life is not on my phone.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:29.920
I mean, I do a lot with my phone.

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.840
Obviously I need it.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:32.840
It's a great, it's a great phone.

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:35.840
If you just need like a consistent phone, latest Android.

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:36.840
That sounds perfect.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:37.840
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:38.840
It's perfect for that.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:39.840
Sounds like an iPhone.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:40.840
Yeah.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.400
It's exactly the kind of like, I'm not, I don't have a lot of complaints.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.040
I don't have a lot of like, I don't need to do anything with it.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.040
It just works.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.040
How's the camera?

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.040
Lovely.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.040
Really?

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.040
Oh yeah.

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:52.040
I'm loving it.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.040
Yeah.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.040
Yeah.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.040
Yeah.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.040
I could, maybe one day.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.040
Maybe one day.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.040
And you know what?

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.040
If I could get, if I could get.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.400
Linux Academy dot com slash unplug.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.400
Go there.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.400
Get a seven day free trial.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:03.400
Learn more about the platform.

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:07.240
And while you're there, I mean, you'd probably be eligible to get a seven day free trial.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.240
I'm just saying.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:10.240
Go to Linux Academy dot com slash unplug.

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240
Sign up.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:12.720
Try to get a Google Pixel.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:13.720
And you're off.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.520
Boy, if you get it, tweet me at Chris LAS.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.240
I seriously want to know about that.

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:19.240
That would be.

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.240
Oh man.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.240
If a JB member can get, ugh.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:22.240
Yeah.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:23.240
Yeah.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.240
Yeah.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:25.240
All right.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:27.800
So are you ready to, are you ready to talk about securing the internet of things and

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.400
smart devices?

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:33.000
I mean, I'm quaking in my boots over here because you said IOT and smart devices in

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
the same sentence.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I know, right.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
But.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Can I put it another?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
But.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Yes.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Let's talk about it.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Cyber.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Ugh.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Ah.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Well, OK.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
How about this for a sentence?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000
You ready for this?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.480
Wes, are you concerned about cyber threats against your smart devices?

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:48.480
Internet of things?

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.480
Huh?

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.960
See, I got cyber threats in there, Wes.

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:51.960
Isn't that good?

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.480
Can I, is there like a thing I can do with my body that just, I'm like a hundred percent,

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.480
a thousand percent yes?

01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.760
Yeah.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:04.040
You know, so I got to just make a huge disclaimer if we go any further because I got to imagine

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.480
I probably should have said this way earlier in the show now.

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.480
Now that I think about it.

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.480
Yeah, that's true.

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:13.360
A lot of you are listening going, Chris, what the AF are you doing?

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:18.520
Why do you have a privatized spying device in your studio right now, literally listening

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.520
to every word you say?

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.200
Spied on the whole show.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.200
Yeah.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.200
Are you crazy?

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.200
Are you ridiculous?

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.200
Are you nuts?

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.200
Have you lost it?

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.360
Don't you care about open source and Linux?

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.600
My God, Chris, what about Mycroft?

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.840
Before you go down that route, I encourage you to go check out how I use the Amazon Echo

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.960
Dot to automate my studio.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:43.080
It's a vlog I posted this morning, just posted a couple of hours ago, and it goes over how

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:49.080
we use the Echo Dot in the studio, why we got them, how I've isolated them off on a

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:55.440
separate network, and what our intention is behind all of that.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:59.800
So just so you know, if you're concerned about that, go watch that episode.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.560
It's all covered in there, how we're using it, all of that stuff.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:07.760
It would be a whole episode to talk about that, so that video is in the show notes.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:11.560
Now, I want to talk about the big concern.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:15.600
The big concern everybody listening has is cloud services, cloud monitoring, things like

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.600
that.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.100
Well, it turns out I've done a little digging, and there's some interesting things that those

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:24.120
of you who are considering getting a device like this might want to look at.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:29.320
Now, I'm not like Mr. Expert on any of these devices yet.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.840
I've got three of them at this point for the studio, because the Echo Dot was $40, and

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.760
what I decided to do was, well, I should get one for myself to learn with it.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.520
So that's upstairs in my office, and then I wanted one in the studio because I checked

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.520
this out.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:47.680
Now, actually, we have video, so if you're watching the video feed, Alexa, turn on JB1.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.160
OK.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.320
Oh, that's so cool.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.320
Look at that.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.320
Yeah.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.320
Yeah.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.320
Alexa, turn off JB1.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.320
OK.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.080
And we're back.

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:08.120
So everything in the studio was sort of in place, and then I can do things like, Alexa,

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.840
turn on studio ambient lights.

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.080
Oh, I didn't say it fast enough.

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.960
Sorry for those of you at home, by the way.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:14.960
I'll get over this.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:15.960
I won't do this.

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.680
Just give them like two months, maybe?

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.720
No, give me like two more minutes in this episode, and then you just, there's a mute

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:21.720
button on there.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.840
Alexa, turn on studio ambient lights.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.320
OK.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.040
Oh, that's lovely.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.600
Yeah, isn't that great?

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.600
Alexa, turn on studio accent lights.

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.320
OK.

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:42.800
Alexa, ask for a fart.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.120
Just to prove a point.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:50.500
So the studio was kind of out of the box just over the years, ready to be integrated, but

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:55.200
we needed, you really kind of need something to centralize the control because this product's

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.320
made by Hughes, this product's made by Belkin, this product over here is made by TP-Link.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:03.280
They all support some weird subset of the same protocol, but, or maybe not.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:07.200
And I want them all isolated off on their own LAN, so that way they're not talking to

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.980
any of my other devices, they're not monitoring any of my other traffic, because I don't trust

01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:10.980
these things.

01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:12.480
I don't trust these things at all.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.360
And so I wanted them off on their own LAN, but in order to actually access them, you'd

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.520
have to take your device and put it on that LAN to talk to them.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.520
Well what kind of stupid idea is that?

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.080
That is not feasible in a lot of cases.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:27.280
That only is that a pain in the butt and breaks whatever I'm doing on my device, but it also

01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.500
then exposes that device to the very thing I'm trying to avoid.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:33.160
It's like the stupidest workaround ever.

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:39.880
And so this device, this Echo, is in that LAN.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:41.740
And so it's my bridge, essentially.

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:45.120
So I talk to it, and it talks to them.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.520
So that's kind of interesting.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.260
But I wanted to make this even better.

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:52.720
So I'm not here yet, but I've begun looking into two different products that look like

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.960
they could essentially act as the command and control of the cloud for a device like

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:57.960
this.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:01.640
The first is Home Assistant at home-assistant.io.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.640
It's a Python app, I think.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.840
Yeah, Python 3.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.160
Home Assistant is an open source home automation platform for running on Python 3.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.160
Open source, did you say?

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.160
Mm-hmm.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:11.160
See where I'm going with this.

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.580
You see where I'm going with this.

01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:20.200
And the other one, and this is maybe the one I'm more likely to look into, OpenHAB, OpenHAB.

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.840
It's a vendor and technology agnostic open source automation software for your home.

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:31.140
And my understanding is, the Echo, I'm trying not to say the hot word, the Echo could actually

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:34.200
talk to it over Bluetooth.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:38.520
And OpenHAB could run on something as simple as a Raspberry Pi.

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:39.520
So it's like-

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.000
Which is even cheaper than the dot.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Yeah, right.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Exactly.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.280
Fully open source, developed in Java.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.280
Yeah.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:51.320
It's got a web UI, it's got Android and iOS apps, and a web, of course, works on the desktop,

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.320
so that's already built in.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.640
It's got notification support, all of these things.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:03.480
And I've seen some indication that there is a way to tie the device into OpenHAB.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:08.880
So that way, instead of going to the Echo Cloud, or the Amazon AWS hosted services,

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.880
it goes to OpenHAB.

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:10.880
Oh, wow, really?

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.880
I'm not sure yet.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:12.940
I don't know what you're looking into there.

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:16.960
So it's kind of a fascinating path I've gotten.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:22.400
And I really kind of think, one of the reasons I want to wrap my head around it now is they

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.000
sold a ton of these over the holidays.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Oh, yes.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.800
And I had so many non-tech people in my life asking about them, or if I tried them.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:29.240
I was astounded.

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.880
And I thought I understood how this all worked.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:36.760
I thought I kind of had it all conceptually figured out, until I actually had to set all

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:41.400
of this up, and create smart groups, and do all of these things, and I have such a deeper

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.400
understanding of it now.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.400
It's like AWS Lite.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.400
Yeah.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.400
It is like an entire thing.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:46.400
You really have to learn.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.640
There's a command structure, and all of this stuff.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:50.280
So it's been fascinating.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.800
And I do kind of feel like it's an interesting thing to know, just the general consumer platform.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:58.280
But man, I can't wait until something like Mycroft comes along.

01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.640
And then that's really going to be where it gets interesting.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:03.480
And that's a space that we need to have open source stuff.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.720
What's that?

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.880
The API of the Echo is pretty good, too.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:07.880
Oh, yeah?

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:08.880
Yeah.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:14.240
There's a lot of integrations for... You can write your own integrations and commands

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:20.080
for the Echo to do a lot of things that aren't necessarily intended to do.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.700
They have integrations built into a lot of things, but you can pretty much write your

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:25.840
own for whatever you want.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:30.140
It's not really open, but the API itself is very extensive.

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:31.240
That's interesting.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:35.920
So I got a dot for the beard to do some experimental development with, too.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.920
Ooh.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.920
Yeah.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.640
I was thinking, maybe we could tie it in with J-Bot.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:43.640
Wouldn't it be great if I could execute... So we control different things in the studio

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.640
now with J-Bot.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.360
Wouldn't it be cool if I could get some of those... If I could bark that at the Echo?

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.360
Yeah.

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.040
How many times at the end of the show are you like, oh, I want to stop the YouTube stream?

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:54.320
You can just yell at the Echo.

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:59.720
It's been interesting to just see how many little scattered devices I had around the

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:02.240
studio that were controlled with it.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:03.860
It's a fun experiment so far.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:06.400
But I think OpenHAB is probably my path.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.400
So this is sort of my call out to the audience.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.920
I heard from an individual this morning, which is really awesome, who might be pretty well

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.360
informed on it, but I've also just put the call out there.

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:19.360
At Chris Elias on Twitter, if you've got something set up and maybe you could give me some advice

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.640
on how I could compare it with my Echo Dot.

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.920
And if it's feasible, I'd love to be able to have one here at the studio, an OpenHAB

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.600
set up, and one maybe like running at the RV, too.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.600
Oh, yeah.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.600
And do I even need the dot?

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:32.600
I have all these questions.

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.600
Yeah.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.600
You don't need the dot for OpenHAB.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:39.680
You can put the software on other devices.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:44.280
And then like, so I wouldn't get the voice stuff, but I would have like one app that

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.680
controls all?

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:46.680
Yeah.

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:47.680
You can have it.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:51.560
I've actually played with OpenHAB myself, but I haven't spent a ton of time on it.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:56.360
But I have dug into it a little bit, and it has ability to use pretty much any device

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.760
you want.

01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:01.520
And it just, depending on what hardware you give it, what features it has.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:07.840
So you can, you can, if you, you can't really like replace the dots or the Echo's like software.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.400
But if you have something that's similar to it and you put OpenHAB on it, you can use

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.840
it to facilitate most of it.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:13.840
Wow.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:18.520
But you can also make it where OpenHAB and the Echo connect to each other, too.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.960
That would be great.

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:24.600
That sounds interesting, because I think, I mean, here's where, here's where I feel

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.440
like this is gone.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:31.480
And as people where we talk about specs, and often we think about open source and community

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:37.920
solutions, we sometimes, I think we fail to see when the market has decided on something.

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:42.920
I wonder if this holiday season, if the Echo didn't tip over to a mass consumer product

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.200
and it sort of won.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:47.600
Boy, didn't Google Home try to push hard on the ads, though.

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.600
Yeah.

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.600
Yeah.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.600
But I don't know that actually translated.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:56.720
Can you name a, can you name a single Google direct product that's done well in the mass

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:57.720
consumer market?

01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.840
Is there any reason to think that Google's good at doing that kind of product?

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:02.840
Yeah.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:10.480
Whereas like Amazon at this point has really got, like there are, there is a, there is

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:14.520
a lot of, there is a lot of different functionality built into Alexa, like they have not slowed

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.400
down from the moment they released it.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.680
There is almost stuff daily they're doing on this thing, like they are very passionate

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.680
about this thing.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.680
It's a huge thing for them.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:23.800
Have you ordered any packages or other things with it?

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:24.800
No.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:32.080
I think it is the number one reason why Alexa, why the Echo will always, it's hard, well

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:36.760
I think will, it is a, it is a, it is a core business interest of Amazon to have this thing

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.160
in your home because they don't have physical stores.

01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:41.840
They need to have this in your home.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.320
This is super important to their business.

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.520
This is their like easy way to interact with you.

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.520
Right.

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.900
For Google, this is another metric.

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:50.600
This is another metric collection device.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.420
It's important, but it's no more important than your Chromecast or your Android TV or

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:59.920
your tablet or your Google Docs account or your YouTube account.

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:04.140
Those are actually probably great, especially your Gmail account is a much richer, greater

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:07.880
source of metrics than a Google Home will ever be because there is a certain line they

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:08.880
just can't cross.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.320
They can't, if they could always monitor, if they could listen to every dumb thing you

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:16.840
say and every time you masturbate and every time you cook dinner and every time you watch

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:21.560
TV, if they could listen to all of that, that would be extremely useful for them and that

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.320
would also destroy their business.

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.080
It would fundamentally undermine their business.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:28.720
So I think we're, I just don't think it's, I don't think it's as critically important

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.920
to Microsoft, to Apple, to, or to Google as it is to Amazon.

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:37.160
I think it's, it's fundamental to Amazon and here I will disagree.

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:42.480
I think the reason Google does not need to make such a big effort is because they already

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.480
have the phone.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:48.400
I actually, you can, there is a page you can visit in Google and listen to all of the recordings

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:54.320
of you saying, okay, Google, and basically see all of you said, I'll record it.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:59.360
You can have access to it, but they already have that and the reason, and the fact that,

01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.280
but they're not, but you know what I'm saying, like they're not always listening, you have

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:04.280
to trigger it.

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.280
Actually, it does.

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.280
Actually, it does.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:10.160
It is always listening to the point that you go to the recordings page, it includes the

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:14.160
part that you said, okay, Google, so it meant that it's recording all the time.

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:15.160
It is always listening.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.360
I can set it up where it's not paying attention to me.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.720
Like right now you said it a bunch of times where my phone's right next to my speaker

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.040
and it didn't do anything because it's not listening.

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:28.960
Well, but in the case of the home, it is, and same with the Echo, it is always listening

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.560
because there's no other way to hear the command word.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:36.840
Like if I just say the A word in casual conversation, it triggers her immediately.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:42.000
I don't have to say it like Captain Picard talking to the computer.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.520
If I just say, you know, Wes, today I tried the Alexa and it's working pretty great, it'll

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:52.880
just pick it up and start running like crazy and the Google Home is the same way.

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.960
However, it's just getting, what it does is it just has like a quick buffer.

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:02.560
It has like a 10 second buffer where it's, yeah, because honestly, if you think about

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:08.480
it, it would be like a constant 800 kilobit stream up if it was uploading everything you

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.480
always said to the cloud.

01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:10.480
It would.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:13.360
Of course it doesn't need to always upload, but this is the thing.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:19.340
When people saying that, you know, we're moving to these assistant oriented world where your

01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:25.280
device doesn't need to be a massive computer, have massive computational power, just get

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:30.880
all of the data from fast connection and basically have a huge battery and this is just the device.

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:35.760
And when you include that alongside having self driving cars, Google actually is working

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.760
on.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:37.760
Right.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:41.840
I don't feel that that's why they don't need to make a huge effort on us because they don't

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.060
care about it.

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:49.280
So today at CES, Amazon announced the Alexa everywhere strategy.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:59.080
So they're building, cancel, they're building it into watches, dish, whirlpool devices.

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:04.200
Volvo is going to do a series of speakers with it built in.

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.560
And there's probably other devices.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.880
I think that goes right back to what you're talking about, where like, here are these

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.960
companies where suddenly the incentive to work with Amazon on this is huge because they

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:12.960
want to sell them.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.660
They know that, you know, you want to get your refills, you're like, hey, washing machine.

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:21.080
Amazon gives preferential placement to devices that work with Echo.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.700
You've seen it if you've gone on Amazon ever.

01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:23.700
You see it.

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:27.520
And so imagine now that one of the biggest, the Walmart of the internet is now going to

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:32.400
feature devices that come with Echo built in and you've got dish enabling Alexa voice

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:35.080
control on its hopper, cancel.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:41.140
You've got whirlpool connected, whirlpool devices, whirlpool freaking appliances.

01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:43.160
Imagine that, cancel.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.840
Imagine being able to bark at that thing to start the dishwasher or just get an update

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:49.600
on how much longer the dishwasher has.

01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:54.320
I feel like also for these companies, Amazon is less risky.

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:59.680
Because not only do they get preferential placement, but when you partner up with Apple

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.360
or when you partner up with Google, you generally get taken to the washer.

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:04.360
Like, it generally…

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.360
And they have their own agenda.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:09.720
I mean, not that Amazon doesn't, but Amazon agenda you can understand in a much clearer

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.720
way.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.500
And the Amazon one is going to sell you more devices.

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:19.840
So that was sort of, I just sort of, in a long-winded way, which was much more eloquently

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:23.720
stated in my vlog video, explained part of why I got one.

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.760
And so I feel like right now I'm in the phase of wrap my head around how this damn thing

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:31.800
works with all these devices and figure out like all of the limitations and all the little

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.860
like boxes you've got to check.

01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:38.740
And then it's like, okay, now that I understand how this consumer product works, how it integrates

01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:41.400
with these other consumer products, what their risks are.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:45.080
Oh, and if you want to know like the monitoring and capturing we're going to do, also check

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:46.080
out that vlog.

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:50.240
Because we're going to be like packet capturing and all that stuff.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.720
Once I get my head around that, then it's time to roll out OpenHAB.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:58.600
Then it's time to like really like, now it's, I've lived that, I've walked that walk.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.600
Right.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:02.960
What's the state of the art if you don't care about the compromises?

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:07.120
If you want to build your own secure LAN, don't want to go out to the net, don't want

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.180
to worry about all of that stuff, is it possible at all?

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.400
Is it ever possible with a device like this?

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.960
Is it ever going to be possible?

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:14.960
Is that so possible?

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.080
You know what, just one last thing before we move on.

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:27.320
I am shocked at how quickly my son Dylan, who's almost 8 years old, picked up the Echo.

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:33.200
Like he's up in my office right now as we're recording this and he's just sitting there

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:38.520
playing Minecraft and he just casually barks over to the Echo to turn off the fan.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:39.520
Or play a fart sound.

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.720
Yeah, definitely that one.

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:46.600
There is something for, there's sort of like a, there's like a, it lowers the barrier.

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:51.000
Like I had all these devices before that I had control from my phone that I would trigger,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.320
that nobody else had access to, and that's not actually a good thing.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:58.080
Because now people around me can turn off the lights and stuff like that.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.080
That lets you delegate.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.040
Well, it just lets them get, like when they're up there too, it lets them get control over

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:04.360
their environment a little bit.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.360
Anyways.

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.360
And it's a great controlling device.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:11.640
It is also, yeah, because there's a Simon Says feature and you can just have it, that's

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.640
where the magic happens.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:17.040
So you can Simon Says that thing all day long and it'll repeat it back to you.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:20.160
There's also, you can have it connect to your phone.

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:23.800
So that's particularly handy too.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.000
It'll connect like a Bluetooth, as a Bluetooth speaker, which is kind of cool.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Wow.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.880
Anyways, playing around with it and I would love to hear the audience's thoughts on it.

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:34.800
So LinuxAction.reddit.com or tweet me at ChrisLAS.

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:38.080
I personally think this conversation's over.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:40.840
I personally think Echo's running away with it.

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:43.600
It's a solid product and it's one of those products too that people that got it are still

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.160
excited about it.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.720
So I think that's all in all.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.720
The barrier to entry is great with a dot.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:49.720
Yeah, right.

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.720
It was 40 bucks.

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:56.600
I think it's still 40 bucks and that's safe experimental levels.

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.160
Yeah, that's right.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:00.480
Something you can easily play with.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:01.480
Yeah.

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.480
Yeah.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.480
Uh-oh.

01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:05.320
I think Dylan's in here trolling us.

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.320
This is the problem.

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:09.280
I can't find the answer to the question I heard.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:13.400
Alexa, Simon says, Dylan, don't interrupt the show.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.560
Let's see if she says that.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.760
Dylan, don't interrupt the show.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:20.440
Dylan, come over here real quick.

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.440
Come here real quick.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.160
Come over here and sit on my lap.

01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:25.880
You got a couple of seconds to tell people.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.760
Dylan, what's your quick review of the Amazon Echo?

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:30.120
Do you like it?

01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:31.120
Yeah.

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.920
And what's your favorite thing to ask it?

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:38.760
Alexa, ask for farts.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.240
That's your favorite thing?

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.240
Yeah.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.680
I'm not sure what you meant by that question.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:47.000
Jesus, too bad.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.560
Alexa, ask for farts.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.560
There we go.

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.200
This is something that Dylan and I were trying earlier.

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:57.200
Let me do it, okay?

01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.440
Okay, I'm going to show them.

01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:05.280
Alexa, what is the largest state in the United States of America?

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.920
The largest U.S. state in the United States is Alaska.

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:13.400
Alexa, how many people live there?

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.480
The population of Alaska is about 686,000.

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.840
That contextual awareness is pretty powerful.

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.640
We've been able to go about three or four deep, I think.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.640
Oh, nice.

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.640
Yeah.

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.640
Do you have one more thing you want to add before we go?

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:25.640
We're about to wrap up the show.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:26.640
Did you want to say something?

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:27.640
All right, get in there.

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.640
Say it.

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:29.640
Bye.

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:30.640
All right.

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.440
It's Dylan's last day of winter break, so he's joining me in this studio.

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.440
Well, that's great.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.440
That's actually really cool.

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:38.800
All right, so that brings us to the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:43.480
If you've got any advice or thoughts on securing the crazy wild west of Internet of Things,

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:45.160
let me know if you've got any experience with it, too.

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.400
What are you doing to lock it down and any open source projects that are helping you

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.320
make it more secure?

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.760
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com.

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:55.040
It's also where you go to submit other project updates you think we should talk about.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.040
At least do.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:58.000
And we'd love to have you join us live next week.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.280
We'll do episode 179 on Tuesday.

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:05.760
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:09.080
And don't forget jblive.tv is the URL you put in there, where our chat room is, where

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.960
you get information about our virtual lug and hang out with us.

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:13.960
We love having all of that.

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:18.680
You can also send us emails at jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact.

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:24.940
And one last reminder, episode 300 of TechSnap, the last Alan and Chris episode, and then

01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:28.000
the new fresh Bigger and Better Blood comes in.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.040
See you next Tuesday.

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:36.040
Thanks for joining us and have a great week and Happy New Year!

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:10.920
Oh, you know what we should have mentioned?

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.880
The Patch Your Shit shirts have relaunched.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:13.880
Oh yeah!

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:14.880
Ahhhh!

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.240
You know what, Wes?

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:17.240
This is what I get.

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:18.880
This is what I get for not being a salesman.

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.560
If I was a good salesman, I would have thought of this.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.560
Yeah, you sure would have.

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:23.320
Teespring.com slash Patch Your Shit.

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.320
Check it out.

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:25.320
Spread the word.

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:26.920
I guess we should have said something.

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:29.360
I can't find the answer to the question I heard.

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:31.000
She doesn't ever find anything for me.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Alexa, buy me some shirts!

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.360
No, don't do that, Alexa.

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:39.440
Alright, jbtitles.com, jbtitles.com.

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:40.440
Thank you, Mumble Room.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.440
You guys are great.

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.440
Yeah, great suggestions.

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:43.440
Really appreciate it.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:44.440
You're welcome.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.440
We didn't actually, we didn't address one thing that's very important.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.640
I can't find the answer to the question I heard.

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:48.640
What?

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.640
What is that?

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:50.640
What did we address?

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.640
What's very important about the Echo?

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:52.640
What?

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:53.640
Perverting free software.

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:54.640
Oh, that's true.

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:58.840
Sorry, I didn't understand the question I heard.

01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:00.160
She doesn't understand it.

01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.960
She doesn't understand about free software.

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:02.960
No, she doesn't.

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.760
I kind of felt like the reason why we didn't really address the free software angle of

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.640
it is because that's kind of a foregone conclusion.

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:10.520
Oh yeah, it's totally not ever going to be.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:11.520
Yeah, no.

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.080
And I think really we've got to wait for the Mycroft.

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.080
Yeah, that's probably true.

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:19.320
But Mycroft is still using Google on the back end.

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:23.480
Well, no, it uses whatever you tell it to use.

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:24.640
You can tell it not to use Google.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.600
You can tell it to use Alexa, if you want.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:28.200
What I meant for the speech recognition.

01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:32.400
Remember that time I hooked Alexa up to the Big Sur?

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.400
Yes, I do.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:38.160
They built their own speech recognition as well.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:39.160
I don't think so.

01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:40.160
Just because, yes.

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:43.520
I think they're still using the web service through Google.

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:44.520
Nope.

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:46.960
They built their own.

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.080
Alexa cancels 2017.

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:50.080
That's one title.

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.700
Dude, this is not duct tape.

01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:53.020
This is gaffer's tape.

01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:54.280
This is what we use in the studio.

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:58.360
They're working on their own infrastructure so that you don't have to use Google and you

01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.360
can use whatever you want.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.400
And you can actually self-host their own protocol and their structure.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.120
Chris goes IoT.

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:07.400
Chrysler minivans will run Linux.

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.280
Alexa predict cancer.

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.280
Cancel.

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:16.120
Farting in 2017 with Alexa.

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:17.120
That's good.

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.120
That is good.

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:20.080
Ooh, Alexa engage 2017.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:22.680
I like the Alexa prediction cancel.

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:25.120
Are you guys still recording?

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.120
Yeah.

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.120
We're still doing our show.

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.120
Oh.

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.120
Yeah.

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.120
I know.

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.120
We do these shows forever, huh?

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.120
Oh, yeah.

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.120
I told you we'd be done at 3.30, didn't I?

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.120
Yeah.

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:35.120
Jeez, well.

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.120
You know, it's Wes.

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:37.120
He just talks so much.

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:38.120
You just can't get me to shut up.

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:39.120
Oh, Simon says the spiders are coming.

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.800
I don't have you hooked up to it.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:42.800
Richard Stalmazan.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:45.400
That's a pretty good pizza, dude.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:46.400
I like it.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:50.440
He won't like it.

01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:51.440
No.

01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:52.920
What does he like?

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.920
Emacs, mostly?

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:54.920
Yeah.

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.920
That's the first one I was gonna say.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.040
Don't say the A word.

01:31:58.040 --> 01:31:59.040
That's pretty good.

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:01.480
I like that, too.

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:04.360
Dot the cloud of things.

01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.800
Chris has gone full retard.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:06.800
Fair.

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.320
Big sister is watching you.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.320
That's pretty good, too.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.320
Yeah, that is pretty good.

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.320
Big sister.

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.320
I like that.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:13.320
Dylan, unplugged.

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:20.480
Boy, I feel like this is the hardest year to do predictions ever, and it's not because

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:25.760
I know, I know, I'm a horrible person.

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.760
Aren't we all?

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:31.240
That's what we've learned in 2017.

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.240
Alexa, cancel 2017.

01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:37.080
2016 is proving that anything can happen, so we're just like, okay.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:40.360
Yeah, I suppose so.

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:43.320
I don't know.

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.320
I don't know.

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:45.600
Do you like Big Sister is Watching You?

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.800
I mean, it might not be the best title.

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:49.800
Should it just be Big Sister is Watching?

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:50.800
Oh, maybe.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:51.800
Alexa, you're big sister.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:54.200
I can't find that skill.

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:58.000
To find skills, go to the skills section of the Alexa app.

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.400
Oh, they actually got a skill, too.

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:03.400
Interesting.

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:04.400
Ask for cards.

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:09.480
Sorry, I didn't understand the question I heard.

01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:12.440
What's great is you can turn that skill off.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:13.440
That's great.

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:16.440
Ask for cards.

01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:20.960
Sorry, I didn't understand the question I heard.

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:22.440
He is determined to get a fart.

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:23.440
Yep.

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:25.880
I mean, we've all been in that position.

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:29.480
Ask for farts.

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.800
I found a few matches.

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:33.080
Do you mean for a fart?

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:34.080
Fart sound jokes.

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.080
Or fart detective.

01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:36.080
Ooh, what's that last one?

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.080
Alexa, fart sound jokes.

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.080
What is that?

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:41.080
I can't find that skill.

01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:44.360
Alexa, what is a fart detective?

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:47.480
Sorry, I didn't understand the question I heard.

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:49.800
Gotta control your laughter there.

01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:55.000
Alexa, ask for farts.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.400
I'm not sure what you meant by that question.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:57.400
What is a fart detective?

01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.400
Find who dealt it?

01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.400
Is that what it is?

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.400
I like how calm she is, though.

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:04.580
I'm going to start, hmm, I don't know what the answer to that is.

01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:05.580
Not that I should know.

01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:07.720
There you go.

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:08.720
You got it.

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:10.640
Yeah, that's the Alexa.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:11.640
Don't you want one now?

01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:12.640
Yeah.

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:15.920
Can I give one to Wes?

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:17.400
You gave a fart to Wes?

01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.980
No, let's give...

01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:19.980
Give a dot to Wes?

01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:20.980
Wes, you should get a dot.

01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:21.980
I should get a dot.

01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:28.240
You know, one thing the Google thing has going for it, I will say, is Google Home.

01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.720
If they could connect all of the...

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:35.800
If OK Googs and Google Home and Google Assistant were all connected...

01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:36.800
Yes, that would be powerful.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.800
Yeah.

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:38.800
Assistant is, I think.

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:40.520
Because then you have it with you.

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:42.800
Because this thing, you know, the Echo is only...

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:43.800
If you're with it.

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:48.480
Yeah, if I could have my home then do all the assistant stuff, yeah, that would be nice.

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.880
So big sister is watching is now the number one.

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.520
They just made an Echo Alexa thing for your phone.

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:54.880
Well, they do have them for watches.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:57.360
I wonder why they don't make an app.

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:58.360
Yeah.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:06.360
Oh, speaking of which, you know, earlier you asked for what is a product that Google

01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:08.200
made that isn't a failure?

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:09.200
Yeah.

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:10.200
Chromecast.

01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:11.200
OK.

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:14.400
I don't know if it's super mass consumer, but it's definitely the biggest hit they've

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:15.400
ever had.

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.040
The $35 price point doesn't hurt.

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:18.040
Doesn't hurt.

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:19.680
Yeah, that's a good point.

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.820
What is the home selling for?

01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:22.880
Like $100 or something?

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:23.880
Or $220.

01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:24.880
$120 or $130.

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:25.880
Oh, wow.

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:26.880
Yeah.

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:27.880
Yeah, it's already back in stock.

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:29.920
It was out of stock in our local Best Buy.

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:34.480
It's the same price as the regular Echo, except Amazon made three versions of the Echo.

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:39.160
So people who don't want to spend the money that would be comparing to the home can get

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:44.840
a cheaper version, and also people who don't want it to constantly listen and get another

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.840
version which costs a little more.

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:51.600
So I think that's probably a really good strategy on Amazon's part.

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:52.600
But you know what?

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.120
I'll tell you.

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:58.200
The Google Home did sell out, but the Echo, everywhere.

01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:03.520
So I had a couple days off before Christmas, and I wanted to get them in the studio.

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:11.400
And I literally called every store, everything from Best Buy to Sears to Bed Bath and Beyond

01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:17.280
to Kmart and Fred Meyer and Home Depot, I called all of them, and they were all sold

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.280
out.

01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:19.280
They sold out everywhere.

01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:20.280
Five months ago?

01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:23.360
I mean, yeah, we talked about it a little bit, but it didn't feel this hot.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.080
Well, Amazon sure pushes it.

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:27.320
Every box comes with Echo stuff all over it.

01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:28.320
It's all over the front page.

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:29.320
The stickers, the packaging.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.560
And so I think people have been really aware of it.

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:35.340
So when it dropped from like $130 something to $40, that's a gift.

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:37.480
That's a casual buy it for yourself with no thinking.

01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:38.480
Sort of like what they did with the Kindle.

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.480
Yeah, right.

01:36:39.480 --> 01:37:00.800
If it's like $70, you're like, okay, yeah, fine, I want one.
