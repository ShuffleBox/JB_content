00:00.000 --> 00:17.920
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 288 for February 12th, 2019.

00:17.920 --> 00:24.800
Well hello there and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show, episode 288.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.480
If you can believe that mess, my name is Chris.

00:27.480 --> 00:28.480
My name is Wes.

00:28.480 --> 00:32.000
Hello Mr. Payne, we have a really fun show today.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.640
We have a tidy batch of community news, then we'll go over to the security corner and bust

00:37.640 --> 00:43.640
one of the biggest hype crazes around container security that I've seen all year.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.040
It's amazing.

00:45.040 --> 00:50.360
Plus this great handy piece of malware that does you a super solid and it cleans up all

00:50.360 --> 00:55.280
the other malware, deletes all the other crap off your system, so that way it can fully

00:55.280 --> 00:56.280
own your box.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.840
I'll tell you about that script that is hitting Linux boxes right now, it's just, it's just

00:59.840 --> 01:00.840
hilarious.

01:00.840 --> 01:05.920
Um, I just, anyways, it's just so funny, I'll tell you more about it then.

01:05.920 --> 01:09.480
After that, we'll have a moment with Fedora in the corner.

01:09.480 --> 01:15.000
There's a lot of Fedora news this week, plus we'll visit with Elle, who's been trying

01:15.000 --> 01:19.360
out OpenSUSE as part of the OpenSUSE challenge that Jason's been putting on.

01:19.360 --> 01:24.480
We'll check in with her, see if she's hit any snags, see if she has anything to report

01:24.480 --> 01:29.240
back that might be interesting to us, and it just happens to be, Wes and I also installed

01:29.240 --> 01:32.480
it last night, so we could give it a go a little bit, so we'd have a little bit to talk

01:32.480 --> 01:33.480
about there too.

01:33.480 --> 01:38.440
We'll wrap it all up with pics, but before we can get into any of that, it is our duty

01:38.440 --> 01:42.240
at this moment in time in the show to bring in that virtual lug.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.800
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
Hello.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.800
Hello.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
Greetings.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.800
Hello everyone.

01:47.800 --> 01:48.800
Aloha.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.800
Hello.

01:49.800 --> 01:53.040
Okay, can I get your, can I get your hot take guys on the OpenSUSE bell that I have?

01:53.040 --> 01:56.760
I've got a bell right here, so I'm holding it right here in my hand, and I got it for

01:56.760 --> 01:57.760
OpenSUSE.

01:57.760 --> 02:03.360
First, this is the first ding on the show, I'd like to hear your thoughts, are you ready?

02:03.360 --> 02:05.200
That is a very tall bell.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.200
Are you sitting on it?

02:06.200 --> 02:07.200
What the hell?

02:07.200 --> 02:08.200
No, I'm not.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.200
I'm sorry.

02:09.200 --> 02:15.080
All right, so maybe we won't be using the OpenSUSE, yeah, that's pretty bad.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.080
What do you think, Wes?

02:16.080 --> 02:17.080
That's pretty bad, isn't it?

02:17.080 --> 02:20.160
Well, I mean, so we've got the original bell, and maybe that, I don't know, what distro

02:20.160 --> 02:22.080
is this bell associated with?

02:22.080 --> 02:23.960
That's the Archbell.

02:23.960 --> 02:24.960
That's the Archbell.

02:24.960 --> 02:25.960
Yeah, that's the Archbell.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.080
Pure, clean as the driven snow.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.080
And then here's the Fedora bell.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.200
You hear that one?

02:30.200 --> 02:31.680
There's the Fedora bell right there.

02:31.680 --> 02:35.280
Yeah, and then I have the Ubuntu bell.

02:35.280 --> 02:42.440
All right guys, well, we're not here today to talk about bells, although it's all that's

02:42.440 --> 02:43.440
really on my mind.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.840
I thought we'd do a little community news to get things rolling.

02:46.840 --> 02:51.520
This first story is, you could look at it in two ways actually.

02:51.520 --> 02:56.720
One of run of the mill boring, or it is the great march of progress of open source desktops.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.040
I choose the latter, my friends.

02:59.040 --> 03:03.080
I am talking about the new release of Plasma 5.15.

03:03.080 --> 03:09.340
There's a lot in this release as always, but now, as a seasoned Plasma user, I thought

03:09.340 --> 03:13.220
I'd pull out a few of my favorites in here and we'd talk about them.

03:13.220 --> 03:20.640
Number one being that Discover has a whole bunch of improvements and fixes.

03:20.640 --> 03:24.720
Wes, do you mind just jumping ahead and listing off what some of those Discover fixes are

03:24.720 --> 03:26.360
there about Midway on the page?

03:26.360 --> 03:27.360
Oh yeah.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.320
And you know, just between you and me and I guess everyone else listening to this, it

03:31.320 --> 03:33.160
kind of needed some of these fixes.

03:33.160 --> 03:37.720
Like distribution repository management is just a lot more practical and actually usable,

03:37.720 --> 03:43.340
especially if maybe you're running something like Neon and it's an Ubuntu based distro.

03:43.340 --> 03:46.880
Also when you're performing a search from the featured page, Discover now only returns

03:46.880 --> 03:51.560
apps in the search results, which kind of makes sense as a basic feature.

03:51.560 --> 03:55.200
Add-ons will appear in search results only when a search is initiated from the add-on

03:55.200 --> 03:56.200
section.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.640
So it's a little smarter about figuring out what are you actually searching for?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.520
Yeah, that's nice.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.960
Here's where it also gets important.

04:01.960 --> 04:06.400
Handling and presentation of errors arising from misconfigured add-on repos has also been

04:06.400 --> 04:07.400
improved.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.560
And I've run into that one before and the previous error message, it just, it didn't

04:09.560 --> 04:14.280
explain what was going on and it was one of those things that often made me say, ah,

04:14.280 --> 04:16.120
maybe I won't use Discover.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.120
Yeah.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.120
Yeah.

04:18.120 --> 04:22.760
Well, I think we'll be talking more about that there in the, in the show later on.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.760
Those are all pretty good.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.680
I think those deserve an open Sousa ding.

04:25.680 --> 04:26.680
So there we go.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.680
We have that.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.600
They also updated the what's new section.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.120
Basically it just doesn't display anything if there's nothing to show, which I think

04:33.120 --> 04:34.120
a great idea.

04:34.120 --> 04:40.960
There's a few other minor things in here like displaying things in your local time and date,

04:40.960 --> 04:47.280
which is also nice to see and including notifications when there is an upgrade to your distro.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.840
So in the pop-up notification for updates, it will now in there mention, there is a whole

04:51.840 --> 04:53.480
new distro ready for you.

04:53.480 --> 04:57.440
But for me, the things that I like a lot is a virtual desktop.

04:57.440 --> 05:02.440
The settings for that have been greatly improved and rewritten to support Wayland.

05:02.440 --> 05:07.120
And along the sort of integration lines and the future of the desktop, integration modules

05:07.120 --> 05:13.400
such as XDG desktop portal, KDE and plasma integration now support the settings portal.

05:13.400 --> 05:19.840
So what that means is sandboxed flat pack and snap applications will respect your plasma

05:19.840 --> 05:27.000
configuration, including fonts, icons, widget themes, and color schemes without requiring

05:27.000 --> 05:31.760
read permissions to the KDE globals configuration file.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.520
Did I get that right, Popey, as far as you know?

05:34.520 --> 05:36.640
I have no idea what you're talking about.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.640
I do.

05:37.640 --> 05:38.640
Okay.

05:38.640 --> 05:39.640
Okay.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.640
Wimpy, did I get that right as far as you know about?

05:40.640 --> 05:42.320
Yes, you did get that right.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.320
Good.

05:43.320 --> 05:44.480
Yeah, that's huge, isn't it?

05:44.480 --> 05:48.080
That seems like a pretty big step forward for sandboxed.

05:48.080 --> 05:54.840
Yeah, it's not just KDE, it's KDE and GTK using desktop environments as well.

05:54.840 --> 05:55.840
Right.

05:55.840 --> 06:00.600
These are actually the X, sorry, XDG, two different components actually, two different

06:00.600 --> 06:03.640
parts and one is XDG desktop portal KDE.

06:03.640 --> 06:08.480
So I would assume there is one that's XDG desktop portal GTK or GNOME or whatever.

06:08.480 --> 06:13.560
Well, yeah, the standard portals are GTK stroke GNOME.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.560
Ah, I see.

06:15.560 --> 06:16.560
That makes sense.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.000
I follow.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.400
And then I love this one last feature I'll call out here is the network management applet

06:23.400 --> 06:28.480
has gotten support for firing up WireGuard VPNs and you can go to the main settings area

06:28.480 --> 06:31.720
and actually add a WireGuard VPN connection.

06:31.720 --> 06:32.720
Nice.

06:32.720 --> 06:34.520
That should get a real ding.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.520
Yeah, that is.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.080
I'm using WireGuard right now to do this show.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.240
I just love it.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.360
I love it.

06:41.360 --> 06:45.320
And so getting it built into my desktop environment is choice.

06:45.320 --> 06:46.520
So it's a really solid update.

06:46.520 --> 06:51.560
Updates to the breeze icons, updates to GTK application integration, a bunch of really

06:51.560 --> 06:53.200
good updates across the board.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.620
This is one of the things that we've been saying about plasma for a while now is if

06:56.620 --> 07:04.160
it's your type of desktop, it's just consistently getting better and better over time.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.820
Solid progress where if you've been using it for a year or so, there's been rough edges

07:07.820 --> 07:11.040
that are now gone and they just continue down that trajectory.

07:11.040 --> 07:17.360
Elle, I'm curious to know your initial take on plasma having come from elementary and

07:17.360 --> 07:22.000
I think you predominantly use GTK GNOME desktops in the past.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.200
So what's your first takes on plasma having used a week or two?

07:26.200 --> 07:27.960
I'm on week two.

07:27.960 --> 07:32.120
And honestly, once I'm able to take a step back from the troubleshooting and actually

07:32.120 --> 07:35.940
get to play with the environment, I very much have enjoyed it.

07:35.940 --> 07:41.800
One of the interesting things that happened to me was using KDE Plasma was the KDE wallet

07:41.800 --> 07:44.460
popping up right away, not letting me go into my environment.

07:44.460 --> 07:48.240
So I think I was blaming certain issues on others.

07:48.240 --> 07:52.520
So it's been interesting to try to learn distinctions between what's KDE, what's plasma, what's

07:52.520 --> 07:54.320
GNOME, what's actually OpenSUSE.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.480
It's been a little overwhelming.

07:55.480 --> 07:59.640
Yeah, that actually is a great example of the wallet because when the wallet comes up,

07:59.640 --> 08:04.160
it's like, hey, do you want to use Blowfish or do you want to use GPG, which is way better.

08:04.160 --> 08:07.480
But then if you choose GPG, it's like, oh, sorry, you don't have all this stuff you need

08:07.480 --> 08:08.480
installed.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.680
And you're just stuck in like a, for, you know, what it seems to be a broken loop.

08:12.680 --> 08:13.960
And yeah, that is very confusing.

08:13.960 --> 08:18.560
Same, you'll find the same thing when it comes to dealing with sound plasma.

08:18.560 --> 08:19.920
It's the same kind of thing.

08:19.920 --> 08:24.640
But I have to wonder, Dan, if every now and then as a team, elementary doesn't look at

08:24.640 --> 08:29.060
what plasma is doing and going, is there a way down the road we could integrate something

08:29.060 --> 08:32.920
like that into Pantheon and maybe smooth out some of the rougher edges, do a little bit

08:32.920 --> 08:37.880
different of an implementation, but some inspiration maybe from plasma from time to time?

08:37.880 --> 08:41.440
I think we're always keeping our eyes and ears open for what other people are doing

08:41.440 --> 08:49.200
and what trends are and features that users are finding useful and where we can look at

08:49.200 --> 08:53.040
our competitors, so to speak, and see what gaps need to be filled.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.040
It's fair enough.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.040
Got to keep out.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.040
Got to keep an eye out.

08:56.040 --> 08:57.040
I follow you.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.040
I follow you.

08:58.040 --> 09:01.120
I'm living in Pantheon right now, so that's where my head's at.

09:01.120 --> 09:04.040
It's been, yeah, why no minimize button, Dan?

09:04.040 --> 09:05.040
Why no minimize button?

09:05.040 --> 09:06.640
I mean, you're killing me with the no minimize here.

09:06.640 --> 09:07.640
You're killing me.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.720
I'm an animal that needs this minimize button.

09:10.720 --> 09:18.400
So this is something that like several years ago, we were looking at window controls that

09:18.400 --> 09:26.360
we decided to ditch the minimize button because we're trying to kind of think about, okay,

09:26.360 --> 09:30.560
if we get rid of all of our assumptions about how window management works and just think

09:30.560 --> 09:34.560
through if we were designing this for the first time, what conclusions would we come

09:34.560 --> 09:35.560
to?

09:35.560 --> 09:36.840
That's a weird concept, isn't it?

09:36.840 --> 09:37.840
Yeah.

09:37.840 --> 09:44.640
And something we thought about minimize was that to a user that has never used floating

09:44.640 --> 09:48.440
window management before, which a lot of them are now, right, because we have kids that

09:48.440 --> 09:52.120
are using iPads and cell phones and things like that, right?

09:52.120 --> 09:58.720
So floating windows is weird as far as people learning computers for the first time.

09:58.720 --> 10:02.600
And the distinction between minimize and close is pretty weird too.

10:02.600 --> 10:09.020
Like both of the things visually make the window go away and sometimes one of them makes

10:09.020 --> 10:12.800
it run in the background, but then there's a lot of apps where when you close it, it's

10:12.800 --> 10:14.920
actually still running in the background.

10:14.920 --> 10:19.380
So there's not really any clear technical distinction between why minimize and close

10:19.380 --> 10:24.520
are two different buttons because the result kind of depends on the developer's implementation

10:24.520 --> 10:25.520
anyway.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.000
So why even do all that stuff?

10:28.000 --> 10:32.540
And why not just have one button that gets rid of the window and then whatever the developer

10:32.540 --> 10:37.240
decides to do, whether that's actually quitting the app or running in the background, that's

10:37.240 --> 10:41.320
what they're going to do anyway, might as well get there.

10:41.320 --> 10:45.880
That's what I like about it actually, is that you guys think about it, you make an opinion,

10:45.880 --> 10:50.880
you go in a direction and you're committed to that idea and you're willing to try things

10:50.880 --> 10:53.680
that other distros or desktops aren't.

10:53.680 --> 10:57.520
I know on Gnome, you know, a lot of people get away with no minimize on Gnome Shell just

10:57.520 --> 10:59.540
fine too.

10:59.540 --> 11:05.960
But for me, I feel like maybe I've reached a point where because I've had it so long.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.240
You're just too old, Chris.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.240
That's it.

11:08.240 --> 11:13.000
I'm an old dog now, but also just because I've come up with ways of workflow that work

11:13.000 --> 11:15.560
really well for me, that's kind of like why I like to have it.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.560
But I am trying it.

11:16.560 --> 11:21.560
I basically just end up using multiple workspaces and that actually, that does fine too.

11:21.560 --> 11:30.840
I think with the seriousness of our next story, we have to take a moment right now in the

11:30.840 --> 11:33.720
show and cover the breaking news.

11:33.720 --> 11:41.600
This is CNN breaking news, SJVN writing for ZDNet in their Linux and open source category.

11:41.600 --> 11:47.080
The topic security doomsday docker security hole has been uncovered.

11:47.080 --> 11:53.840
A security vulnerability has been disclosed for a flaw in Run C and everyone is doomed.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.200
You have to immediately patch.

11:56.200 --> 12:02.400
It is a total disaster doomsday scenario, SJVN says.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.040
Well, ZDNet editors do.

12:05.040 --> 12:09.080
But what's really happened is actually the exact opposite.

12:09.080 --> 12:15.160
Not only is it not a doomsday scenario, but it is an example of a success story for Linux

12:15.160 --> 12:21.400
security and a living production example of why a belt and suspenders approach to your

12:21.400 --> 12:26.680
security in a production server environment is critical.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.160
It bears all that out right here.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.840
But of course, that's not that's weird.

12:30.840 --> 12:34.600
You know, let's give the old bell here to SJVN.

12:34.600 --> 12:35.600
You're in that one.

12:35.600 --> 12:40.760
Now, a security vulnerability affecting a key component of the larger container ecosystem

12:40.760 --> 12:46.200
has been discovered that can be exploited to give an attacker root access to a host

12:46.200 --> 12:47.200
operating system.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.680
So there is an underlying issue here.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.320
But there is some good news, right, Wes?

12:52.320 --> 12:53.760
Yeah, you know, there is some good news.

12:53.760 --> 12:57.960
So first of all, you're going to need to have a specific sort of compromised image, malicious

12:57.960 --> 13:00.440
image in the first place to do this.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.760
And in a lot of environments, that's just not going to happen.

13:02.760 --> 13:07.160
Now, the downside here is, as we've talked about on many JP shows, Docker Hub is not

13:07.160 --> 13:08.760
always the best place to trust.

13:08.760 --> 13:12.760
So if you haven't been following good practices with where you get your images from, you might

13:12.760 --> 13:13.840
have a problem.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.520
But it does actually require you doing something.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.220
It's not just going to happen randomly.

13:18.220 --> 13:23.720
There's also several mitigating factors in how the host or containers are run.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.440
And SC Linux might be configured on the box, right?

13:27.440 --> 13:28.440
Oh, yes.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.760
And don't you just know Red Hat was happy to point that out right away that if you do

13:31.760 --> 13:36.940
have their standards set up with SC Linux in enforcing mode, this wasn't actually going

13:36.940 --> 13:38.200
to affect you.

13:38.200 --> 13:42.280
And the other thing here that we should note, too, is if you are using some of the runtimes

13:42.280 --> 13:47.880
and most runtimes were affected by this, surprisingly, it's not just Run C. Run C is a little core

13:47.880 --> 13:52.200
of Docker that actually does all the talking to the kernel, makes all the namespaces, handles

13:52.200 --> 13:54.960
talking to cgroups, sets everything up for you.

13:54.960 --> 14:01.040
Alex C, also vulnerable, and the way it worked out is you can be really clever about it and

14:01.040 --> 14:05.120
you wait, it involves some timing stuff and getting it just right, but you can actually

14:05.120 --> 14:09.960
from inside the container replace Run C the executable outside the container.

14:09.960 --> 14:14.600
So once you've done that, obviously Run C is running with usually set UID and it's got

14:14.600 --> 14:15.600
root permission.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.040
So that's your box owned right there.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.040
All right.

14:19.040 --> 14:25.680
And in that particular scenario, so you've gotten a bad container image and you're putting

14:25.680 --> 14:31.280
that bad container image onto your production server without checking it and you are running

14:31.280 --> 14:37.480
with SC Linux disabled in a production server environment or AppArmor and your namespace

14:37.480 --> 14:38.640
is running as root, right?

14:38.640 --> 14:42.160
Because there is the possibility that these namespaces could be running with user privileges.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.360
Yeah, exactly.

14:43.360 --> 14:47.040
So there are ways that you could mitigate this and if you're not using that functionality,

14:47.040 --> 14:48.520
you're still vulnerable.

14:48.520 --> 14:53.800
Run C itself, Upstream and Mobi really only recently got enough stuff landed that would

14:53.800 --> 14:58.520
have fully mitigated this, but Run C underlying that does have the capability.

14:58.520 --> 15:02.440
So if you've understood really what's happening, if you've set things up with defense and depth

15:02.440 --> 15:06.280
and multiple layers, then it's something you need to patch, but it's not, you know, don't

15:06.280 --> 15:09.440
go pulling your hair out right now and setting the whole data center on fire.

15:09.440 --> 15:13.480
The way the Red Hat security engineer explained it is I've been calling SC Linux the spare

15:13.480 --> 15:14.480
tire here.

15:14.480 --> 15:20.480
I would drive around on a spare tire for three days, a week maybe, but I wouldn't drive around

15:20.480 --> 15:22.240
on a spare tire for a year.

15:22.240 --> 15:26.600
The good part about SC Linux secondary control is that it buys you time to patch before you

15:26.600 --> 15:28.280
get exploited.

15:28.280 --> 15:32.480
That's true for AppArmor 2 and other access control lists, but on top of that, I think

15:32.480 --> 15:39.080
the thing to make sure I'm clear on is it is best practice in production now.

15:39.080 --> 15:43.720
I grant you it is a recent best practice on Linux, but it is best practice now on Linux

15:43.720 --> 15:49.640
to run the namespaces that your containers are in with user-level accounts, not as root,

15:49.640 --> 15:50.640
correct?

15:50.640 --> 15:52.720
So it's been somewhat of a complicated history.

15:52.720 --> 15:56.680
User namespaces have been around for a while, but it's been a long time coming that they're

15:56.680 --> 15:59.760
actually seeing a whole bunch of use.

15:59.760 --> 16:03.160
And part of that was because it's a hard thing to really get right, and there have been several

16:03.160 --> 16:08.660
prominent vulnerabilities as a relation of us, the kernel community, getting those wrong.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.960
But it's been around for a long time now.

16:10.960 --> 16:16.440
And as we see with this vulnerability, not having the root from the host system mapped

16:16.440 --> 16:20.600
into the container, that's really good, and it can prevent a lot of the things.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.560
And yes, we have other tools.

16:23.560 --> 16:24.560
Yes, we have SC Linux.

16:24.560 --> 16:25.840
Yes, there's capabilities that you can do.

16:25.840 --> 16:29.200
There's all kinds of additional techniques to secure containers, and you should probably

16:29.200 --> 16:32.400
be using all kinds and mixing and matching from those things.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.760
But user namespaces is just a technology that its time has come to be used.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.920
We don't need to disable it in kernels anymore.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.620
You don't really need to be worried about it.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.000
Of course, there might be future bugs.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
That's always going to be true.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.840
And that's why you just need to make sure you update regularly and use all the security

16:46.840 --> 16:47.840
features you can.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.840
Yeah.

16:48.840 --> 16:55.920
And to me, it illustrates what a chicken shit operation ZDNet is, because SJVN can write

16:55.920 --> 17:01.040
this piece that even in the piece talks about how RHEL by default isn't vulnerable to this,

17:01.040 --> 17:04.080
and other distributions are not by default vulnerable to this.

17:04.080 --> 17:09.200
And the piece even stipulates that you have to use a pre-infected container that you pull

17:09.200 --> 17:13.080
down on your production system, even with all that in the article, they still run it

17:13.080 --> 17:18.920
with doomsday scenario for containers, a doomsday scenario for Docker.

17:18.920 --> 17:23.800
And the reason why you know that they are a worthless publication that makes no impact

17:23.800 --> 17:29.640
in the public discourse is because just reimagine this scenario if the New York Times or the

17:29.640 --> 17:35.000
Wall Street Journal or Ars Technica or TechCrunch ran a headline like that.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.640
That would actually damage the Docker brand.

17:37.640 --> 17:43.320
Like the company that runs Docker would be in PR crisis mode right now.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.720
But when ZDNet does it is no big deal.

17:45.720 --> 17:50.420
I still call them out for it because in my opinion, it's crap journalism that damages

17:50.420 --> 17:53.420
open source and SJVN should know better.

17:53.420 --> 17:56.900
And he should have the clout at ZDNet to go to them and say, don't put a piece of shit

17:56.900 --> 18:02.800
headline like that on my article, because this is an example of why running Linux in

18:02.800 --> 18:08.200
production is a success story, because even with a vulnerability like this, there are

18:08.200 --> 18:13.440
two other at least mitigating circumstances that would prevent you from being at risk

18:13.440 --> 18:18.520
from this, assuming you're following best practices, which you likely are if you're

18:18.520 --> 18:23.240
using a server in production in any kind of important capacity.

18:23.240 --> 18:26.540
And yet they run that as a doomsday.

18:26.540 --> 18:27.540
It's damaging.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.600
It's bad.

18:28.600 --> 18:34.280
And the only mitigating factor we have as a community is that they are irrelevant.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.880
That's the only mitigating factor we have.

18:35.880 --> 18:40.880
If they had more traffic, if they mattered more, this would be very bad.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.960
It's it's reckless.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.880
And SJVN should know better.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.820
He's been covering this stuff for forever.

18:48.820 --> 18:49.820
He should have.

18:49.820 --> 18:52.680
And if he doesn't have the pull with them to run better headlines than that, then he

18:52.680 --> 18:54.960
should leave and start his own publication.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.040
And I'd love to see how that goes.

18:57.040 --> 18:59.320
It's ridiculous.

18:59.320 --> 19:03.560
And you know, I'm almost done, but I just got to say we have been publishing shows for

19:03.560 --> 19:08.440
over 13 years and we have never, ever gone with a headline like that.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.840
It is completely irresponsible.

19:10.840 --> 19:11.960
It's so frustrating.

19:11.960 --> 19:17.240
It really does upset me because it's not like commercial software where there's a company

19:17.240 --> 19:21.280
that has a big marketing department that can manage the PR disaster.

19:21.280 --> 19:25.700
Like it gets in the mindsets of the open source community and it results in less contributions

19:25.700 --> 19:32.880
and it results in shit talk and it damages brands in a way that is totally unlike any

19:32.880 --> 19:33.880
other industry.

19:33.880 --> 19:34.880
All right.

19:34.880 --> 19:35.880
End of rant.

19:35.880 --> 19:36.880
It just really it does.

19:36.880 --> 19:37.880
It truly gets me upset.

19:37.880 --> 19:42.680
So in speaking, talking about branding there, just one little happy note at the end, interestingly,

19:42.680 --> 19:45.520
system dnspon, not vulnerable.

19:45.520 --> 19:49.400
It's an open to spell too.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.520
Now this has been known for a little while.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.520
It sounds like wimpy.

19:52.520 --> 19:57.440
Yeah, I mean, obviously these, these CVS are, you know, dealt with under embargo.

19:57.440 --> 20:01.840
I was just having a quick look at when these fixes were applied and they've been being

20:01.840 --> 20:03.520
applied for some weeks now.

20:03.520 --> 20:08.520
So in Ubuntu and the other distributions, you know, the unattended updates will have

20:08.520 --> 20:11.320
been rolling these patches out for weeks already.

20:11.320 --> 20:15.600
That's the other thing that makes it completely a non doomsday scenario is the patches are

20:15.600 --> 20:17.320
already available.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.320
Patches are good.

20:18.320 --> 20:22.400
They're out as people have been working on it for a few weeks, not working on it for

20:22.400 --> 20:23.400
a few weeks.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.280
These patches have been applied for a few weeks.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.440
You know, this work was done further back than that.

20:28.440 --> 20:32.080
The patches have been available and in the updates.

20:32.080 --> 20:37.200
So by today, there's been several weeks of you being able to get the updates.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.200
So there you go.

20:38.200 --> 20:43.480
It's not it's not even something that's like a large in the wild attack that people are

20:43.480 --> 20:45.480
suffering from.

20:45.480 --> 20:46.480
Not like our next story.

20:46.480 --> 20:47.480
Our next story.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.480
This is a great security story.

20:48.480 --> 20:51.000
This is my favorite kind of security story.

20:51.000 --> 20:56.080
Trend Micro has been tracking this cork, corkerds or whatever.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.880
Yeah, it sounds like it.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.880
I read it as cork nerds the first time.

21:01.880 --> 21:08.680
And it is a clever piece of malware that removes all other malware and miners, which is the

21:08.680 --> 21:12.920
most common kind of malware that Linux servers are getting these days from your system.

21:12.920 --> 21:17.060
It comes in and the first job one is clean your box up, which is hilarious to me.

21:17.060 --> 21:21.200
On further analysis, Trend Micro found that the script capable of deleting a number of

21:21.200 --> 21:26.240
known Linux malware coin miners, and it would also make sure it closed all connections to

21:26.240 --> 21:30.560
other minor services, ports and pools.

21:30.560 --> 21:34.680
It then installed a cryptocurrency mining malware itself, and it implants itself into

21:34.680 --> 21:39.920
the system and then uses cron tab to survive reboots and deletions.

21:39.920 --> 21:46.400
I love the cron tab angle like schedule yourself to restore yourself later after they find

21:46.400 --> 21:47.400
me.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.000
It's kind of perfect for that, right?

21:49.000 --> 21:53.360
Like I've got a good clip here showing just a bunch of net stat and grep and awk command.

21:53.360 --> 21:56.360
So it's really like, you know, someone's just having fun at the terminal, cleaning your

21:56.360 --> 22:00.800
machine up a little and as compensation, maybe you can mine some coin for them.

22:00.800 --> 22:01.800
Well you think about it, right?

22:01.800 --> 22:04.400
You don't want the machine busy mining other people's coins because that's going to slow

22:04.400 --> 22:07.440
down how much coin it mines for you.

22:07.440 --> 22:12.720
So to maximize profits, you got to make sure the box that you're going on to is clean.

22:12.720 --> 22:17.400
Because that way all of its dedicated CPU or GPU can be for you.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.040
How far do cryptocurrencies have to drop?

22:19.040 --> 22:20.560
We were talking about this last week.

22:20.560 --> 22:23.840
How far do they have to drop where we're not going to see this anymore, where there'll

22:23.840 --> 22:26.720
be more profitable things to do with the hijacked CPU?

22:26.720 --> 22:28.940
You know, I was thinking that could be a thing.

22:28.940 --> 22:31.900
But I think the issue is, is you've always got a new coin.

22:31.900 --> 22:36.760
And so there's always like a bit of bubble for these new coins.

22:36.760 --> 22:43.120
And if you can mine a few thousand of them pretty quickly across, say you own 5000 machines,

22:43.120 --> 22:47.960
and then you get all of them to generate 100 to 1000 coins, and then you can sell them

22:47.960 --> 22:51.680
all, even if it's super, super cheap at that volume, you could then convert it to Bitcoin

22:51.680 --> 22:52.680
and sell the Bitcoin.

22:52.680 --> 22:57.520
It's not like you, you know, even if you're, even if you're not mining a ton, you're not

22:57.520 --> 23:00.240
out anything because you're using other people's resources.

23:00.240 --> 23:04.040
So that's one genie, the crypto miner genie is never going back in the bottle.

23:04.040 --> 23:10.440
Maybe this might be one of the most persistent form of malware attacks we see for a long

23:10.440 --> 23:11.440
time.

23:11.440 --> 23:16.680
I mean, we've been seeing more and more crypto mining malware for a while, but one that removes

23:16.680 --> 23:18.520
other malware.

23:18.520 --> 23:19.780
That's awesome.

23:19.780 --> 23:21.400
That's so good.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.320
And then schedules itself in cron tab.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.320
Yeah, right.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.440
It digs deep, it gets its hooks in there.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.440
It wants to stay.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.720
I mean, when you put in that much work, you've earned it.

23:29.720 --> 23:30.720
Yep.

23:30.720 --> 23:31.720
Yep.

23:31.720 --> 23:32.720
Yep.

23:32.720 --> 23:36.400
All right, Neil, welcome on Fedora right now as we record this episode.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.400
Hi.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.060
All right, Neil, why don't you come in the Fedora corner with us?

23:40.060 --> 23:44.080
We're going to go, we're going to go over the corner where the air is a little fresher,

23:44.080 --> 23:46.240
smells a little more free.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.880
This is the Fedora freedom corner over here.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.400
And I like that.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.200
Yeah, it's, you know, it's nice here.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.340
Grass is greener sometimes.

23:53.340 --> 23:56.920
And then you look over the other camp and all of a sudden the grass looks greener again.

23:56.920 --> 24:00.220
Now there's a lot to talk about with Fedora this week.

24:00.220 --> 24:04.320
Each individually, it's not huge, but when you add it all up and you put Fedora in a

24:04.320 --> 24:06.360
corner, you've got a ton of stuff here.

24:06.360 --> 24:10.480
And I think we should start with the one that most people are talking about is Fedora's

24:10.480 --> 24:13.200
new logo redesign.

24:13.200 --> 24:18.160
I'm pointing this out to you because it is a fascinating study of what it is like to

24:18.160 --> 24:22.560
go through to design a logo, which we have been doing behind the scenes for all of our

24:22.560 --> 24:25.720
shows for well since October.

24:25.720 --> 24:30.880
And it's a really valuable insight into this process and they write here far from just

24:30.880 --> 24:33.860
being an arbitrary logo change.

24:33.860 --> 24:38.480
This process is being undertaken to solve a number of issues encountered with the current

24:38.480 --> 24:39.760
logo.

24:39.760 --> 24:46.440
Some of the issues with the current logo include the lack of a single color variant and consequently

24:46.440 --> 24:49.980
the logo not working well on dark backgrounds.

24:49.980 --> 24:56.200
Other changes with the current logo is confusion with well other known brands and the use of

24:56.200 --> 25:00.040
a proprietary font.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.600
And they have samples of where they're going with it.

25:01.600 --> 25:05.180
I think it looks pretty sharp, but of course the eye is always in the beholder so you can

25:05.180 --> 25:07.760
check the link in there.

25:07.760 --> 25:10.760
But I want to just make you aware of it.

25:10.760 --> 25:14.800
There's another thing brewing over in the Fedora camp that you may be somewhat familiar

25:14.800 --> 25:15.800
with.

25:15.800 --> 25:19.240
We've touched on it once before on the show and that is Fedora's attempt to come up with

25:19.240 --> 25:25.520
a way to track the install base without being creepy in you know in any kind of overly aggressive

25:25.520 --> 25:29.840
ways that might put off users and there's several different ways you can do this.

25:29.840 --> 25:34.580
We've seen Canonical strike a good balance with their system and Fedora wants to do something

25:34.580 --> 25:38.280
similar but implement it differently and maybe use some of their own built-in tools.

25:38.280 --> 25:44.120
Well they just had their weekly Fedora engineering and steering committee on Monday I think and

25:44.120 --> 25:50.320
they approved a sort of quote-unquote sane approach for counting users and that mostly

25:50.320 --> 25:55.400
is okay let's do it as long as we can do it in a way that we're all satisfied with.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.200
Which I guess is interesting.

25:57.200 --> 26:02.280
It's not the original UUID driven proposal that we originally covered.

26:02.280 --> 26:07.280
It's something different perhaps with some sort of DNF counting mechanism I suppose we'll

26:07.280 --> 26:09.200
see.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.360
Not really sure on the details of how they're going to track.

26:11.360 --> 26:15.960
Yeah they say that relies upon a count me bit that will be incremented weekly or so.

26:15.960 --> 26:19.520
I guess they're just trying to see sort of sort of liveness see how many installs will

26:19.520 --> 26:23.360
keep updating that bit and you know are actually being installed out there.

26:23.360 --> 26:24.360
I don't know.

26:24.360 --> 26:27.840
Neil what are your insights into this decision-making process and what the goals are?

26:27.840 --> 26:32.920
Well I mean so the logo thing is pretty straightforward you've already kind of covered that and for

26:32.920 --> 26:38.080
what it's worth I was actually part a little bit a part of that process as well because

26:38.080 --> 26:43.840
one of the annoyances to put it lightly about the Fedora logo as it is and I love the Fedora

26:43.840 --> 26:48.660
logo so like it's not you know being a hater on it or anything but one of the annoyances

26:48.660 --> 26:55.620
was that because it doesn't work in a monochrome environment very well we can't really use

26:55.620 --> 27:00.520
the Fedora logo as the boot ups of the desktop environment boot up splash and KDE because

27:00.520 --> 27:04.860
it looks like garbage when you do it that way because when you invert the color scheme

27:04.860 --> 27:11.440
it just looks really bad and so we just use the stock KDE logo because of that.

27:11.440 --> 27:16.120
Most distributions because their logo has either been already refactored to be single

27:16.120 --> 27:23.400
color like Kibuntus was or has already got a simple form already and it only works already

27:23.400 --> 27:29.800
works well in a monochrome like OpenSUSE does you know they didn't have this problem.

27:29.800 --> 27:37.240
So that's been a perennial issue for us with the branding side so I kind of welcomed this

27:37.240 --> 27:40.600
change and I've given my own feedback about like how it should evolve.

27:40.600 --> 27:44.040
I think it's going pretty well in that sense.

27:44.040 --> 27:52.320
For the tracking change, well not really tracking but like the counting, what it really comes

27:52.320 --> 27:57.840
down to is that nobody really has a clue about what stuff is being used and this has actually

27:57.840 --> 28:02.760
become a little bit more of a problem as Fedora has had more and more spins, additions, variants

28:02.760 --> 28:09.760
and whatnot and the thing is you know there's a certain point where you start wondering

28:09.760 --> 28:14.280
if the effort is going anywhere meaningful and it doesn't matter whether it's a first

28:14.280 --> 28:19.760
class edition as that's splashed on the front page or if it's a desktop spin that you know

28:19.760 --> 28:25.020
like five or ten people are working together on to kind of showcase their favorite desktop

28:25.020 --> 28:27.260
environment on their favorite distribution stack.

28:27.260 --> 28:31.480
You kind of want to know like how people are receiving your content and so you can help

28:31.480 --> 28:35.720
people who are interested in it to see it more and how you can attract other people

28:35.720 --> 28:40.080
to kind of take a look at it and you want to see like the growth trajectory for those

28:40.080 --> 28:43.440
things and that doesn't require knowing anything about anyone.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.960
No, you just want numbers, right?

28:44.960 --> 28:50.200
You just want a way to know how popular things are, what version is getting used a bunch

28:50.200 --> 28:53.560
or what software packages maybe would be nice I would think but doesn't even sound like

28:53.560 --> 28:54.560
they're going to get that.

28:54.560 --> 28:58.440
There's a couple of things about like knowing specific software being installed that gets

28:58.440 --> 29:04.720
a little bit weird but like knowing the variant that people are using like so in Fedora 30,

29:04.720 --> 29:13.060
the upcoming Fedora 30, we've made it so that each deliverable image whatever has its own

29:13.060 --> 29:17.960
unique identifier as a variant and so like for example the Fedora container, the base

29:17.960 --> 29:21.040
container has a specialized variant ID.

29:21.040 --> 29:27.060
So does the Fedora workstation, so does the server, so does the upcoming Fedora Core OS,

29:27.060 --> 29:32.740
so does the IoT edition, so on and so forth and we can use that information to identify

29:32.740 --> 29:37.640
like where are we hitting the right notes and where are we like a little bit off key

29:37.640 --> 29:44.580
so to speak and as we can fine tune and improve and like to help either broaden the base or

29:44.580 --> 29:48.360
like dig into places where we're getting really successful or shore up where we're really

29:48.360 --> 29:52.040
weak just to make it like the experience better and stuff like that.

29:52.040 --> 29:56.180
I mean Canonical and SUSE are both familiar with these practices because they've done

29:56.180 --> 30:02.260
it for years and years and years in different ways of course but like for them it has actually

30:02.260 --> 30:07.080
been a godsend because that's how they like the famous you know if you were around 10

30:07.080 --> 30:14.440
or 15 years ago like the famous paper cuts stuff that Ubuntu did for successive releases

30:14.440 --> 30:16.960
to make GNOME not suck.

30:16.960 --> 30:21.640
That was a lot of research and that was a lot of like getting information from people

30:21.640 --> 30:25.120
and doing a little bit of counting and tracking to identify what's going on.

30:25.120 --> 30:28.320
Let me have Popey jump in here because he has thoughts on this thing too.

30:28.320 --> 30:32.400
You think it's an interesting progression for Fedora as a project Popey?

30:32.400 --> 30:37.820
Yeah because it's not just, I agree with Neil, it's not just about raw numbers for things

30:37.820 --> 30:39.160
like installs.

30:39.160 --> 30:45.120
So one of the numbers that fledgling Linux distros like to throw around is the number

30:45.120 --> 30:51.440
of ISO downloads they have which is largely meaningless because you download an ISO image,

30:51.440 --> 30:55.080
you chuck it on a USB key, you take it along to a Linux user group and you spread it around

30:55.080 --> 31:02.200
and you know is that one, is that 10 or you download it, put it on a USB key, never use

31:02.200 --> 31:03.200
it.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.400
Is that one or is that zero?

31:05.400 --> 31:10.800
It's hard to know and what you really want to know is not how many people downloaded

31:10.800 --> 31:16.280
my thing but how many people are weekly active users, how many people are actively using

31:16.280 --> 31:21.740
the thing that I made and if that turns out to be zero then do you want to invest engineering

31:21.740 --> 31:26.120
time making that thing, whatever it is, a piece of software, a platform, an ISO image,

31:26.120 --> 31:31.840
whatever it might be and all the engineering effort that's invested in making the thing

31:31.840 --> 31:37.400
and keeping the thing running and all the security updates or the backend services,

31:37.400 --> 31:39.680
you've got to know whether that's worth doing.

31:39.680 --> 31:45.960
Like when Will Cook wrote his email about the proposal for having metrics, it was all

31:45.960 --> 31:52.680
so that we could drive these decisions so we could decide do we want to make significant

31:52.680 --> 31:57.640
investment in one project or another and we need to know.

31:57.640 --> 32:02.480
We can't just base it on number of ISO downloads because that is an irrelevant number and doesn't

32:02.480 --> 32:07.480
really match, it doesn't tell us whether people are running this in a VM or on real hardware,

32:07.480 --> 32:10.880
it doesn't tell us 32-bit or 64-bit, it tells us nothing.

32:10.880 --> 32:16.400
So I think this is great, it's extra data that will enable the Fedora teams to focus

32:16.400 --> 32:20.960
their attention on the stuff that matters to the significant number of users, it's great.

32:20.960 --> 32:21.960
Yeah.

32:21.960 --> 32:26.780
Neil, do you think they would make the numbers public and also do you think this is maybe

32:26.780 --> 32:30.720
useful when discussing the value of Fedora with IBM?

32:30.720 --> 32:34.840
Well okay, so first of all this isn't even Fedora's first rodeo at doing this.

32:34.840 --> 32:42.140
We did this back in, what was it, Fedora core 5, 6?

32:42.140 --> 32:45.980
So we did this a long time ago when we did it for a different reason.

32:45.980 --> 32:51.480
So Hopi alluded to figuring out whether the thing was worth putting engineering effort

32:51.480 --> 32:52.480
into.

32:52.480 --> 32:57.200
So back in those days the thing that we were looking at was making the graphic stack not

32:57.200 --> 32:58.200
suck.

32:58.200 --> 33:08.040
So Adam Jackson and other friends in the Xorg space, we used to have tooling in Fedora built

33:08.040 --> 33:16.160
in and would be optionally activated during setup to have records of your hardware profile

33:16.160 --> 33:21.520
and send it back to the Fedora project for figuring out what kind of hardware people

33:21.520 --> 33:22.520
are using.

33:22.520 --> 33:27.200
And that was actually a big part of how they originally focused on making things like AIGLX

33:27.200 --> 33:33.960
better, making the compositing stuff, figuring out which hardware profiles they needed to

33:33.960 --> 33:38.480
make sure that it worked the best, and which stuff actually sucked so bad that it needed

33:38.480 --> 33:40.380
immediate attention.

33:40.380 --> 33:46.340
That kind of stuff was invaluable for networking as well and a number of other categories across

33:46.340 --> 33:47.340
the board.

33:47.340 --> 33:52.280
We discontinued the program after a few years but that data really helped in that regard.

33:52.280 --> 33:55.880
And in this case now most of the hardware stuff is kind of not really a problem.

33:55.880 --> 34:00.400
We already have a good idea of what people are using so we don't really need to revive

34:00.400 --> 34:01.780
that kind of thing.

34:01.780 --> 34:08.600
In this case we're just trying to figure out how people are using it on a sustained level,

34:08.600 --> 34:11.820
which variants of Fedora, how they're using it, what stuff they're pulling.

34:11.820 --> 34:16.520
We have some idea through the mirror manager service that we run that we have the geologic

34:16.520 --> 34:20.120
ages of Fedora as Matt Miller likes to say.

34:20.120 --> 34:25.200
And so we have some idea of the sustained rate of the cumulative downloads of Fedora

34:25.200 --> 34:29.840
content that includes ISOs, RPMs, metadata, the works.

34:29.840 --> 34:34.720
But we don't have an idea beyond like that morass of downloads.

34:34.720 --> 34:37.380
We don't know like additions or any of those things.

34:37.380 --> 34:42.800
So we know that Fedora is on the balance getting more popular, being used more.

34:42.800 --> 34:45.800
But we don't know where is the breakdown exactly.

34:45.800 --> 34:50.460
We could kind of guess a little bit based on ISOs but as Pope mentioned that's basically

34:50.460 --> 34:54.440
a meaningless metric for all the reasons he said and more.

34:54.440 --> 34:59.140
Do you think we can expect to see the project be public with the numbers but also be very

34:59.140 --> 35:02.140
clear and explicit about how they're handling the data?

35:02.140 --> 35:07.960
If you read the messaging mailing list right now, it seems like they're very, very aware

35:07.960 --> 35:13.400
that this is a sensitive issue and they really have no intention of storing data and information

35:13.400 --> 35:16.680
about people and they want to design this thing in such a way to do that.

35:16.680 --> 35:20.920
But it seems like the challenge is going to be communicating that to Fedora users.

35:20.920 --> 35:23.280
Do you think they have a shot of successfully doing that?

35:23.280 --> 35:24.800
I mean they kind of have to.

35:24.800 --> 35:27.920
So here's the most important aspect of it.

35:27.920 --> 35:31.480
If they're not communicating that data and putting it up publicly, I mean even the Fedora

35:31.480 --> 35:34.000
contributors who are working on the things can't see it.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.400
So it's going to be public because that's just the way we've rolled with this stuff.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.040
We don't have the...

35:40.040 --> 35:44.360
So unlike some other distributions like for example Ubuntu has the wonderful benefit of

35:44.360 --> 35:50.320
having canonical spearheading a lot of the engineering stuff and OpenSUSE historically

35:50.320 --> 35:56.800
though not less so currently, I heard the sad bell.

35:56.800 --> 36:04.200
The OpenSUSE historically but not currently has had a lot of engineering driven from SUSE.

36:04.200 --> 36:09.540
So in those particular scenarios, they have the advantage of like it doesn't really matter

36:09.540 --> 36:12.000
too much if the data is publicized.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.880
For Fedora, the balance of contributors is heavily weighted towards non-Red Hatters and

36:17.880 --> 36:22.200
even within Red Hat, they're most likely not going to be happy if the data was private.

36:22.200 --> 36:26.900
So it's most likely going to be designed to be anonymized and designed to be public similar

36:26.900 --> 36:30.360
to how the hardware tracking data was when we had that years ago.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.360
Okay.

36:31.360 --> 36:32.360
Well, let's keep moving.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.280
A couple other stories in the Fedora corner.

36:34.280 --> 36:42.400
Fedora 30 is going to get Bash 5.0 and Yum's death sentence is postponed to Fedora 31.

36:42.400 --> 36:51.440
And then last but not least, draft schedule is now available for Fedora 31 and it looks

36:51.440 --> 36:54.040
like it's landing on time.

36:54.040 --> 36:59.560
After some discussion before the end of the year, we've decided to not go with an extended

36:59.560 --> 37:04.880
development cycle for Fedora 31 after getting input from within the team on Fedora.

37:04.880 --> 37:10.520
The basic structure of the Fedora 31 schedule is pretty much similar to the Fedora 30 schedule.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.400
Well, I think it was off air, Neil, but you totally called this off air.

37:13.400 --> 37:19.640
I asked you, I said, do you think this Fedora 31 delay, essentially missing a release cycle,

37:19.640 --> 37:20.640
is going to happen?

37:20.640 --> 37:22.800
And you said, no, I don't think it has a chance.

37:22.800 --> 37:23.800
What went wrong here?

37:23.800 --> 37:28.360
Because Matt came on the show and I think he made a pretty good case for retooling,

37:28.360 --> 37:33.800
taking some time to take care of themselves and look inward and self-love for a bit and

37:33.800 --> 37:37.040
then come back with a more efficient build process.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.960
And when I bounced that off you, you're like, mm, doubt it.

37:39.960 --> 37:40.960
So why?

37:40.960 --> 37:47.560
That's like the silliest way to describe this, but okay.

37:47.560 --> 37:52.700
So what it really comes down to is that it doesn't make, nothing happens unless there's

37:52.700 --> 37:55.220
a release target to go for, right?

37:55.220 --> 38:01.320
So whether we want to sit back for a year and make something happen is sort of beside

38:01.320 --> 38:06.400
the point because there's no value in doing that work if nothing is going to come of it.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.840
Like if nobody's going to see it.

38:08.840 --> 38:15.480
And quite frankly, historically speaking, for big changes like this, they're almost

38:15.480 --> 38:18.200
impossible to plan beyond a quarter anyway.

38:18.200 --> 38:21.540
Like once you go past three months, everything slips like crazy.

38:21.540 --> 38:22.840
It doesn't matter.

38:22.840 --> 38:30.360
So saying, okay, we're going to stop and just push back until like next year for another

38:30.360 --> 38:32.440
release so we could retool.

38:32.440 --> 38:37.520
Like in most cases, almost all that stuff will slip so much that Fedora 31, if it was

38:37.520 --> 38:46.540
like in next May rather than in October, that will slip because nobody will have taken it

38:46.540 --> 38:50.580
seriously enough to operate at their normal cadence and speed.

38:50.580 --> 38:55.680
So it wasn't going to happen because quite frankly, if you thought about it enough, it

38:55.680 --> 38:56.800
would be ludicrous.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.400
Like nothing in release engineering ever happens without a target, speaking as someone who

39:00.400 --> 39:01.760
does it professionally.

39:01.760 --> 39:07.680
If there is no target or no priority or no push for it, it's just not happening.

39:07.680 --> 39:12.120
And then the end users are left with nothing while other distros are continuing to release.

39:12.120 --> 39:13.120
Exactly.

39:13.120 --> 39:18.360
And for Fedora, a big part of it is the continuous incremental innovation that we have by shipping

39:18.360 --> 39:23.280
basically on a regular cadence, working with the upstreams directly and being part of that

39:23.280 --> 39:25.420
process.

39:25.420 --> 39:27.320
You take that part away, then what are we left with?

39:27.320 --> 39:30.800
Okay, so we're a distribution that has no customizations on anything.

39:30.800 --> 39:36.880
And we just ship a bunch of stuff and then eventually somebody gets it and they do stuff

39:36.880 --> 39:37.880
with it.

39:37.880 --> 39:38.880
What?

39:38.880 --> 39:41.560
No, just no.

39:41.560 --> 39:48.180
You take away almost all of the value in how Fedora operates and how it releases to people

39:48.180 --> 39:50.280
and how it's usually consumed.

39:50.280 --> 39:53.120
So if you take that part away, then what's the point?

39:53.120 --> 39:57.280
Well, the other option is now you've got to fix the vehicle while it's in motion.

39:57.280 --> 40:01.320
Fixing the vehicle while it's in motion implies that something is actually really broken.

40:01.320 --> 40:04.200
Fact of the matter is nothing's actually broken.

40:04.200 --> 40:11.040
The things that they're wanting are, some of it is big stuff, I will grant, but most

40:11.040 --> 40:15.160
of it is incremental improvements or layers that are stacking on top of the system.

40:15.160 --> 40:21.720
Nobody has been proposing something like what happened in 2005-ish when we decided that

40:21.720 --> 40:32.520
the build system we had prior, famously called Plague, was replaced with Koji, a brand new

40:32.520 --> 40:37.280
build system built from scratch to deal with the problems that Fedora had.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.440
Even in that case, we didn't delay Fedora's releases.

40:39.440 --> 40:43.120
What happened was that the new build system, Koji, was being developed in parallel.

40:43.120 --> 40:45.880
And then it was deployed and then everything was swapped over.

40:45.880 --> 40:47.940
That happened in 2007.

40:47.940 --> 40:51.200
And then in 2009, we switched from CVS to Git.

40:51.200 --> 40:55.000
Well, during that period, there was, I think, like a year and a half that they were running

40:55.000 --> 40:56.260
in parallel.

40:56.260 --> 40:58.560
And CVS was regularly exporting into Git.

40:58.560 --> 41:02.760
And we were checking how everything was working and blowing it away and trying it again.

41:02.760 --> 41:08.720
The thing is that you can do these kinds of things in tandem if you really want to.

41:08.720 --> 41:13.980
If you are really driven to be successful and make something big, then you can do it.

41:13.980 --> 41:17.960
It's just a matter of, do you care enough to make it happen?

41:17.960 --> 41:18.960
And fired up.

41:18.960 --> 41:19.960
Yeah.

41:19.960 --> 41:23.720
So this has been one of those things where I get actually quite upset about because...

41:23.720 --> 41:25.960
That's an episode of us getting on our soapboxes about stuff.

41:25.960 --> 41:26.960
I love it.

41:26.960 --> 41:27.960
No, go ahead.

41:27.960 --> 41:28.960
I already did mine.

41:28.960 --> 41:36.160
Well, so the thing is, the thing that I have counted on for the, oh, God, 12 years I've

41:36.160 --> 41:40.880
been using Fedora as a contributor and 15 years I've been using it as a user.

41:40.880 --> 41:47.320
All of that has been the cadence, the new stuff, the integration, and really just the

41:47.320 --> 41:53.200
overall quality and the development process has just been a big part of why I like using

41:53.200 --> 41:54.620
this distribution.

41:54.620 --> 41:57.800
And the thing is, yes, most people use Ubuntu.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.480
They don't use Fedora.

41:59.480 --> 42:04.160
And even though that's something that I wish was different, that is the way it is today.

42:04.160 --> 42:08.000
However, even the work we're all doing in Fedora still benefits people in OpenSUSE,

42:08.000 --> 42:10.440
and Ubuntu, and Debian, and so on.

42:10.440 --> 42:13.320
And if you take that part away, who's going to pick up the bag?

42:13.320 --> 42:15.520
I don't actually know who would do it.

42:15.520 --> 42:21.040
Your point is pretty well taken in the sense that they are filling a very important role

42:21.040 --> 42:25.560
in the open source desktop innovation space, and they're pushing the ball forward.

42:25.560 --> 42:26.560
It's not just the desktop, though.

42:26.560 --> 42:27.740
It's the server.

42:27.740 --> 42:28.740
It's the cloud.

42:28.740 --> 42:29.740
It's the containers.

42:29.740 --> 42:34.720
Like, Fedora is one of the few distributions I'm aware of that actively, directly tests

42:34.720 --> 42:40.540
and integrates SVN snapshots of GCC and Git snapshots of the Linux kernel.

42:40.540 --> 42:46.880
We do that, and it runs in our environments, and the entire Fedora rawhide collection of

42:46.880 --> 42:52.840
packages is used as a regression test suite against GCC.

42:52.840 --> 42:54.280
That is a big deal.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.860
Well, let me tell you, I've been trying out rawhide.

42:56.860 --> 42:59.600
It is a rough ride for us end users that want to try it, though.

42:59.600 --> 43:02.680
Yeah, but it is a big deal because somebody's got to do it.

43:02.680 --> 43:03.680
Right.

43:03.680 --> 43:06.640
And the thing is, it's not even as scary as it was 10 years ago.

43:06.640 --> 43:09.680
Most of the time, the shit's just working.

43:09.680 --> 43:10.680
I don't know.

43:10.680 --> 43:12.160
It broke on me.

43:12.160 --> 43:15.320
Well, I didn't say it was always working.

43:15.320 --> 43:16.920
I said most of the time.

43:16.920 --> 43:20.800
So Fedora plays such an important role because the community tries its best to bring the

43:20.800 --> 43:27.320
best of Linux to everyone, and at the same time, we try to make the Linux platform the

43:27.320 --> 43:33.600
best it can be, and we do it in a way that is transparent and, frankly, easy for everyone

43:33.600 --> 43:39.120
to be a part of, and that's incredibly valuable to me.

43:39.120 --> 43:41.160
Now that is a hell of a Fedora freedom corner.

43:41.160 --> 43:43.640
Boy, you got me all fired up about it now, Neil.

43:43.640 --> 43:47.720
Boy, if you ever want to talk Fedora with Neil, that is fascinating.

43:47.720 --> 43:51.760
So much interesting when you think about it, the critical role that they're really playing

43:51.760 --> 43:52.760
there.

43:52.760 --> 43:57.920
And yet, I would say we probably don't have a full picture of it as end users.

43:57.920 --> 44:03.000
I think we know bits and pieces of it, but I still maintain it'd be really great if somebody

44:03.000 --> 44:07.940
made a map, a visual map of the different projects that they're either lead of or contributing

44:07.940 --> 44:08.940
to.

44:08.940 --> 44:11.520
But Mr. Payne, you know what I'm getting excited about?

44:11.520 --> 44:15.000
I think you finally found a new bell that you wanted to purchase to replace the open

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
CC fail bell?

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
No.

44:17.000 --> 44:18.000
No.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.000
No, not yet.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.000
That's an aftershow task for sure.

44:20.000 --> 44:21.000
No, it's scale.

44:21.000 --> 44:27.200
March, what is it, like the 7th through the 10th or something like that?

44:27.200 --> 44:28.760
It's a long event.

44:28.760 --> 44:32.860
There's an Ubicon there too, I think early in the week, like on a Thursday.

44:32.860 --> 44:34.880
Anybody you know going to that, Popey or Wimpy?

44:34.880 --> 44:35.880
Maybe.

44:35.880 --> 44:36.880
Maybe.

44:36.880 --> 44:40.680
I'm not sure about the logistics because a lot of us are traveling a lot at the moment,

44:40.680 --> 44:41.920
including trips to America.

44:41.920 --> 44:44.400
So we want to make sure we spread the load around.

44:44.400 --> 44:49.060
Well, if you or someone you know makes it, make sure you tell them about our Saturday

44:49.060 --> 44:50.200
night meetup.

44:50.200 --> 44:54.720
We're going to do dinner with whoever wants to join us at PF Chang's unless the group

44:54.720 --> 44:56.520
gets huge and we may re-venue.

44:56.520 --> 44:59.360
But we have plenty of time to adjust to.

44:59.360 --> 45:01.480
It's going to be Saturday, March 9th.

45:01.480 --> 45:03.760
Go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.640
We've got seven people joining us so far.

45:05.640 --> 45:11.000
And a big thank you to Matty, aka Geek Dad, for setting up the reservation at PF Chang's

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
for that.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.000
I'm really looking forward to scale.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.840
I've already got plans.

45:14.840 --> 45:17.260
Right now we're trying to figure out where the hell to stay.

45:17.260 --> 45:18.260
No kidding.

45:18.260 --> 45:19.320
Elle suggested an Airbnb.

45:19.320 --> 45:20.320
That's not a bad idea.

45:20.320 --> 45:23.960
Plus, maybe you could bring that Super Nintendo system you got.

45:23.960 --> 45:24.960
Oh, that'd be fun.

45:24.960 --> 45:25.960
That'd be fun.

45:25.960 --> 45:26.960
That would be pretty good.

45:26.960 --> 45:27.960
Yeah.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.720
The only the only trouble is like you have no idea what the audio acoustics are like.

45:30.720 --> 45:31.720
So it makes it harder for podcasting.

45:31.720 --> 45:32.720
Oh, yeah, that's hard.

45:32.720 --> 45:33.720
There's no rating, right?

45:33.720 --> 45:36.800
I mean, you know, you can't just see like rate by acoustic reflectivity.

45:36.800 --> 45:37.800
That's right.

45:37.800 --> 45:38.800
So they should, though.

45:38.800 --> 45:43.080
The internet speeds and acoustics, those should be part of the reviews.

45:43.080 --> 45:46.920
But I'm I'm already setting aside Saturday morning.

45:46.920 --> 45:48.080
I think it's morning, right, Elle?

45:48.080 --> 45:51.920
You have a talk like pretty early on Saturday, early ish, like eleven ish.

45:51.920 --> 45:54.320
I'm right after the keynote Saturday morning.

45:54.320 --> 45:56.400
Oh, right after the keynote.

45:56.400 --> 45:57.400
Nice.

45:57.400 --> 45:58.400
No pressure.

45:58.400 --> 46:02.200
Do yourself a favor, skip the keynote, get a nice breakfast and then you'll be ready

46:02.200 --> 46:04.600
to learn all about containers and what you need to know.

46:04.600 --> 46:06.120
Yeah, that's a great title.

46:06.120 --> 46:09.680
Containers, what you need to know so you know what you need to know.

46:09.680 --> 46:11.880
I had a lot of fun coming up with that one.

46:11.880 --> 46:16.280
But anyone who's tried to learn something new can completely understand that sentiment.

46:16.280 --> 46:17.280
Oh, yeah.

46:17.280 --> 46:18.280
Yeah, you're right.

46:18.280 --> 46:19.280
Yeah, that does.

46:19.280 --> 46:20.840
That does make sense from that perspective.

46:20.840 --> 46:26.500
That looks good in ballroom B, Saturday, March 9th, eleven thirty to twelve thirty.

46:26.500 --> 46:29.120
Go catch Elle and something tells me that's probably where you're going to find Wes and

46:29.120 --> 46:30.760
I at that time, too.

46:30.760 --> 46:31.760
Sure will.

46:31.760 --> 46:32.760
Come join us.

46:32.760 --> 46:33.760
Yeah.

46:33.760 --> 46:34.760
All right.

46:34.760 --> 46:41.280
Well, why don't we now move over to the land of open Sousa and the open Sousa challenge.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.000
I think it's wasted effort.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.200
Elle, you've been running open Sousa now for a couple of weeks.

46:46.200 --> 46:49.280
You made the jump from elementary challenge.

46:49.280 --> 46:54.880
Jason from the Choose Linux podcast, Choose Linux dot show and Ryder over at Forbes had

46:54.880 --> 47:00.060
a great idea of doing these distro challenges and everybody loves a challenge.

47:00.060 --> 47:03.200
Everybody loves a challenge and has gotten quite a bit of traction.

47:03.200 --> 47:05.560
You gotten wrapped up in it.

47:05.560 --> 47:11.760
And I'm really fascinated to start with your take on the move from elementary and Pantheon,

47:11.760 --> 47:17.940
which is what I'm using right now, over to open Sousa and Plasma, which could not be

47:17.940 --> 47:20.760
more polar opposite than elementary OS.

47:20.760 --> 47:21.760
How did that go?

47:21.760 --> 47:26.520
Yeah, I honestly maybe it's because I don't have a lot of history with either of them,

47:26.520 --> 47:32.520
but I didn't notice that big of a transition, you know, the appearance wise and the ability

47:32.520 --> 47:38.000
to automatically shrink my windows, which I am one of those that likes that, you know,

47:38.000 --> 47:43.640
that was that was great, but I didn't really feel like there was a learning curve or anything.

47:43.640 --> 47:48.080
Now the package management system, though, totally different, the installer radically

47:48.080 --> 47:50.200
different than elementary OS.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.200
What about that stuff?

47:51.200 --> 47:55.080
So that's where I've definitely I don't want to say I've hit a wall because I've managed

47:55.080 --> 47:59.400
to configure things, but, you know, I was having the conversation earlier with I don't

47:59.400 --> 48:04.080
even know what repos I'm supposed to have because it feels like every time I go to install

48:04.080 --> 48:08.560
something or I try to configure something, they are giving me three to four more repos

48:08.560 --> 48:09.940
that I need.

48:09.940 --> 48:15.360
And I'm not somebody that just feels comfortable having 40 repos that I'm constantly updating

48:15.360 --> 48:17.700
and just trusting them at face value.

48:17.700 --> 48:19.240
I think more people should be skeptical.

48:19.240 --> 48:21.160
So I encourage that behavior.

48:21.160 --> 48:25.360
So you've been doing something really kind of clever, and that is you've been keeping

48:25.360 --> 48:31.600
a log of the software you've installed, the repos you've had to add, the printing woes

48:31.600 --> 48:34.640
that you've run into the issues with trying to get slack working.

48:34.640 --> 48:39.440
You're posting all of this stuff, stuff up on your GitHub repo.

48:39.440 --> 48:41.480
And this is all this is all in there.

48:41.480 --> 48:44.960
And I'm going through like your app install log right here.

48:44.960 --> 48:48.980
And you're right, like almost every single time you wanted to install an app with the

48:48.980 --> 48:55.400
exception of Git, it looks like, you had to add a repo.

48:55.400 --> 48:58.720
And that's pretty complicated commands to do it.

48:58.720 --> 49:02.920
Did you try using the Discover graphical GUI to manage software?

49:02.920 --> 49:04.240
So I did.

49:04.240 --> 49:07.980
And this is where it might be user error, it might just be being new.

49:07.980 --> 49:13.140
But I kept running into the issues of yast versus zipper, zipper, sorry.

49:13.140 --> 49:17.760
And I would run into issues where it says, okay, well, this graphical tool isn't configured

49:17.760 --> 49:22.040
to actually be able to do this, you know, you need to go change these settings.

49:22.040 --> 49:26.400
And then I would look it up online, and everybody's like, oh, just install it through the terminal.

49:26.400 --> 49:28.400
Like, why are you even bothering with that?

49:28.400 --> 49:31.960
So I got to the point where I think I turned to you and Wes and said, why are these tools

49:31.960 --> 49:35.760
even included in the GUI if I'm just supposed to know to go to the terminal?

49:35.760 --> 49:39.000
Yeah, it's like, just don't install them.

49:39.000 --> 49:43.880
One of the issues that we ran into as well is with the rolling updates is having 1000

49:43.880 --> 49:48.320
plus packages that were pushed and automatically getting the updates on Twitter.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.600
Don't do it through the GUI.

49:49.600 --> 49:50.600
Everything will break.

49:50.600 --> 49:51.600
You'll have to re kick.

49:51.600 --> 49:54.800
Unfortunately, I got that news after I'd already updated.

49:54.800 --> 49:55.800
Right?

49:55.800 --> 49:58.160
Because you get the little pop up down in the system tray, and it says, hey, there's

49:58.160 --> 49:59.160
updates available.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.380
So like, oh, okay, well, let me do that.

50:00.380 --> 50:05.920
We just fixed this bug upstream and package get like it just what was the bug?

50:05.920 --> 50:11.120
So here, they're actually kind of bugs, but one of them is the one that bites most people.

50:11.120 --> 50:16.640
So some backstory here, as everyone knows, is the package manager that opens is a uses

50:16.640 --> 50:18.200
for its distribution, right?

50:18.200 --> 50:22.280
So an RPM based package manager uses a SAT solver similar to what DNF does.

50:22.280 --> 50:28.800
But one of the problems with with zipper is that or not zipper specifically, but with

50:28.800 --> 50:34.480
the way openSUSE is using zipper is that there is a distinction with in my opinion, not much

50:34.480 --> 50:39.560
difference about how upgrades should be handled between tumbleweed and leap.

50:39.560 --> 50:45.320
Now package kit has no awareness of this difference, which makes this a problem because it does

50:45.320 --> 50:49.220
the wrong upgrade action every time.

50:49.220 --> 50:54.120
And so what happens is that you get into a half broken state, because zipper will hold

50:54.120 --> 50:57.120
back packages in a way that doesn't make any sense.

50:57.120 --> 51:02.700
It won't process transfers, source changes, renames, certain things like that.

51:02.700 --> 51:06.960
And so your computer just gets into a weird state and everything is broken.

51:06.960 --> 51:11.480
And you just have to use a you have to use a butterfist snapshot and roll back.

51:11.480 --> 51:12.480
That's not good.

51:12.480 --> 51:18.040
And so the what we just fixed, I think it was it just went in, it just got merged into

51:18.040 --> 51:22.480
package kit a couple of weeks ago, was a fix to change it so that it when it detects that

51:22.480 --> 51:27.720
it's going to when it hits a package in the package selection that says, okay, this is

51:27.720 --> 51:32.000
like, what openSUSE calls a product upgrade, like it's going from one tumbleweed snapshot

51:32.000 --> 51:35.120
to the next, it changes the upgrade mode.

51:35.120 --> 51:40.880
And so it automatically switches from doing a normal upgrade to what it's called is a

51:40.880 --> 51:44.220
dist upgrade or distribution synchronization state.

51:44.220 --> 51:48.520
And the distribution synchronization state takes all the packages, whether it's upgrades,

51:48.520 --> 51:52.600
downgrades, reinstalls, whatever from the server, and says, I don't care, they're getting

51:52.600 --> 51:54.080
applied on this computer.

51:54.080 --> 51:59.800
And so that keeps the that keeps the transaction state consistent, and should make future future

51:59.800 --> 52:01.560
stuff work.

52:01.560 --> 52:05.400
That should have been backwarded into package kit in openSUSE tumbleweed.

52:05.400 --> 52:09.240
And that should be rolling out hopefully this snapshot, maybe the next one.

52:09.240 --> 52:13.640
Well, no, that was probably all included in the series of updates that L installed.

52:13.640 --> 52:18.060
So L, what did you do to get out of the situation since you'd already clicked upgrade, I assumed

52:18.060 --> 52:19.840
you must have bought the system.

52:19.840 --> 52:24.480
So it was very interesting working if that's, I don't know, that's got to be the weirdest

52:24.480 --> 52:26.520
sentence I've ever made.

52:26.520 --> 52:30.520
But I had things like resolve.conf, all my name servers disappeared.

52:30.520 --> 52:32.400
I have no idea why.

52:32.400 --> 52:36.800
Suddenly if I suspended my laptop and I opened my lid backup, I could log into the system

52:36.800 --> 52:38.280
without a password.

52:38.280 --> 52:42.960
I went ahead and filed a bug report or actually somebody filed a bug report on my behalf as

52:42.960 --> 52:47.540
I found other users through Twitter that were experiencing the exact same issue.

52:47.540 --> 52:50.680
And we were lucky that we were doing it together because a few people were like, oh, well,

52:50.680 --> 52:51.680
we set up Lux and Crip.

52:51.680 --> 52:54.160
So we didn't think we needed a password anymore.

52:54.160 --> 52:57.840
And this is what happens when you have people who are new just trying to figure out a new

52:57.840 --> 53:01.640
technology that honestly doesn't have the best documentation.

53:01.640 --> 53:06.840
I found great documentation for Leap, but Tumbleweed, I feel like I'm making it up as

53:06.840 --> 53:08.120
I go along.

53:08.120 --> 53:12.040
I tried to system admin my way through it and fix issues.

53:12.040 --> 53:17.920
I went into the KDE, I forget which configuration file it was, and actually found what was enabled

53:17.920 --> 53:19.480
and disabled it.

53:19.480 --> 53:24.520
And in the end, I ended up deciding I no longer trusted my system and I didn't feel it was

53:24.520 --> 53:25.520
secure.

53:25.520 --> 53:28.440
So we just re-kicked again.

53:28.440 --> 53:30.480
Decided against just doing a rollback, but just do a reinstall.

53:30.480 --> 53:32.320
At that point, probably not a bad idea.

53:32.320 --> 53:36.640
Now I want to take a moment and let Cubicle Nate jump in here because there's a long time

53:36.640 --> 53:39.880
SUSE user, Cubicle Nate, a few things must be jumping out at you here.

53:39.880 --> 53:41.940
Yeah, I'm actually jumping around right now.

53:41.940 --> 53:46.600
So most of those fixes could have been taken care of if you actually just did, you know,

53:46.600 --> 53:47.600
sudo zip or dup.

53:47.600 --> 53:52.840
And that actually would have basically re-baselined your Tumbleweed install and you can just keep

53:52.840 --> 53:53.840
rolling along, pun intended.

53:53.840 --> 53:57.160
Okay, I'm going to just jump in here for a second right there.

53:57.160 --> 54:01.720
So I think part of one of the things that I've picked up on is, and Elle, tell me if

54:01.720 --> 54:06.280
you think I'm wrong here, is it's almost always the answer of, well, you could have just done

54:06.280 --> 54:08.240
X and that would have solved it.

54:08.240 --> 54:11.320
But that stuff isn't necessarily discoverable.

54:11.320 --> 54:14.920
And in some cases, it's not even what the UI may or may not be prompting you to do.

54:14.920 --> 54:16.560
Like there may be text that says you to do it.

54:16.560 --> 54:20.360
But if there's a button that does something else, that's a really mixed message to new

54:20.360 --> 54:21.360
users.

54:21.360 --> 54:25.000
You know, one of the things I ran into was the little gooey popped up and said, hey,

54:25.000 --> 54:26.680
you have a thousand plus updates.

54:26.680 --> 54:30.920
I figured I'll just let this run overnight and it'll be done when I get up in the morning.

54:30.920 --> 54:34.440
It wasn't until then that I was told about running the zipper dup.

54:34.440 --> 54:36.000
And so you said I could have just done that.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.600
Would that be possible after the fact?

54:37.600 --> 54:39.480
I mean, at that point I was already in.

54:39.480 --> 54:42.400
Yes, it would have been possible after the fact, after you even screw up your system.

54:42.400 --> 54:43.400
Good to know.

54:43.400 --> 54:46.880
If you have a working terminal and internet connection, you can pretty much recover any

54:46.880 --> 54:48.080
Tumbleweed install.

54:48.080 --> 54:49.080
That's awesome.

54:49.080 --> 54:50.080
Okay.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.080
So that's good.

54:51.080 --> 54:52.080
That's cool.

54:52.080 --> 54:53.080
And that's one of these things.

54:53.080 --> 54:56.360
Like if you stick with it for a long time, over a few months, you'll collect these little

54:56.360 --> 55:00.800
tools here and there and then you'll be you'll be pretty confident using the distro.

55:00.800 --> 55:03.680
It's just some of these things take a bit of a learning curve.

55:03.680 --> 55:04.680
Without a buddy system.

55:04.680 --> 55:05.680
Yeah.

55:05.680 --> 55:06.680
Right.

55:06.680 --> 55:07.680
How are you going to know?

55:07.680 --> 55:09.200
You almost seem like an assigned mentor for the project who will teach you all the tips

55:09.200 --> 55:11.040
and tricks you need to actually survive.

55:11.040 --> 55:12.840
Richard can only tweet so many people.

55:12.840 --> 55:14.080
Yeah, exactly.

55:14.080 --> 55:16.900
I love OpenSUSE Tumbleweed as a rolling distribution.

55:16.900 --> 55:19.880
It's actually one of the two major development environments that I use.

55:19.880 --> 55:22.920
I have a Fedora and I have an OpenSUSE system.

55:22.920 --> 55:28.160
But holy crap, somebody needs to sit down and like actually figure out what what things

55:28.160 --> 55:32.380
are the avenues that people are supposed to go and like get.

55:32.380 --> 55:34.560
People aren't supposed to second guess themselves on their own computers.

55:34.560 --> 55:38.320
I do that on my OpenSUSE system and I'm supposed to be an expert at this.

55:38.320 --> 55:42.240
Like if I'm second guessing myself on how my system is supposed to work, that's probably

55:42.240 --> 55:44.240
not a great thing.

55:44.240 --> 55:45.240
Yeah.

55:45.240 --> 55:49.400
And this is one of the reasons like when when we when the issue with package kit with like

55:49.400 --> 55:53.360
the contributor who fixed this, who made the patch to fix this, I was actually talking

55:53.360 --> 55:54.360
to him about it before.

55:54.360 --> 55:58.080
I was like, this is this is how we fixed it in the DNF back end.

55:58.080 --> 56:01.400
And we can probably replicate this in the zipper back end as well.

56:01.400 --> 56:05.120
And so he went in and like did it and I reviewed the patch for him.

56:05.120 --> 56:09.000
We got the guy who maintains different OpenSUSE to like take a look at the patch and he went

56:09.000 --> 56:14.560
and looked and at the end, some more fixes, then it got merged and hopefully next package

56:14.560 --> 56:15.560
kit that we find.

56:15.560 --> 56:21.240
But like the end problem here is the desktop environment and the desktop user experience

56:21.240 --> 56:26.320
is half broken because the tools that are part of the desktop environment can't be trusted

56:26.320 --> 56:27.560
to work.

56:27.560 --> 56:30.400
And that is that is a major failing in my book.

56:30.400 --> 56:34.640
And that's, you know, as much as I dislike the fact that Fedora doesn't have like when

56:34.640 --> 56:39.040
you look at a Fedora desktop, there isn't so much stuff that is uniquely Fedora anymore

56:39.040 --> 56:43.080
in a in a in a desktop, even on in no more.

56:43.080 --> 56:44.280
I completely agree.

56:44.280 --> 56:49.680
But the stuff works because we hammered the crap out of it to make sure that all the integration

56:49.680 --> 56:52.480
points from the upstream projects are actually working.

56:52.480 --> 56:56.600
And somebody needs to, you know, give a good a hard look at how these things are working

56:56.600 --> 57:00.880
in OpenSUSE and say, OK, we want these code paths to work.

57:00.880 --> 57:02.880
We want these behaviors to make sense.

57:02.880 --> 57:07.760
We want people to you know, we want them to have a true path to success here so that they

57:07.760 --> 57:10.400
can feel naturally able to use the distribution.

57:10.400 --> 57:13.880
It shouldn't matter that leap is the one that works and tumbleweed is the one that doesn't

57:13.880 --> 57:17.600
because it has, you know, a different upgrade mechanism that has to run.

57:17.600 --> 57:20.320
That should nobody should care about that.

57:20.320 --> 57:23.760
And I'm saying this as a person who cares about this deeply.

57:23.760 --> 57:25.840
Nobody should care about that.

57:25.840 --> 57:28.760
And the fact that you have to care is a problem.

57:28.760 --> 57:29.760
That's kind of it.

57:29.760 --> 57:30.760
That is kind of it.

57:30.760 --> 57:36.680
I tried to run leap to begin with before any of this started and ended up having issues

57:36.680 --> 57:39.880
with what we found out later was my graphical card.

57:39.880 --> 57:42.040
I read it as a kernel panic.

57:42.040 --> 57:47.640
And when I tried to bring that up, I have it in my GitHub, but the OpenSUSE response

57:47.640 --> 57:50.960
was basically telling me I couldn't compare the two.

57:50.960 --> 57:53.480
And really, I should have been using tumbleweed to begin with.

57:53.480 --> 57:58.200
When I'm thinking, wait, the driver issue should have been stable on leap, not on tumbleweed.

57:58.200 --> 58:01.000
So it gets really confusing for a new end user.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.720
So the fact that we've been we've managed to spend this much time even talking about

58:04.720 --> 58:10.540
these different nuances is staggering because they literally don't exist on Ubuntu or Fedora.

58:10.540 --> 58:15.120
And it makes a significant difference when people are coming into a system.

58:15.120 --> 58:21.760
If you're like cubicle Nate or if you're like Richard or even Neil and you have the time

58:21.760 --> 58:27.600
to spend six months to a year to a decade learning these tools inside and out, you were

58:27.600 --> 58:30.680
there when zipper was developed, you were there the day that they rolled out butter

58:30.680 --> 58:37.420
fs snapshots, you grok all this stuff, then it's a fantastic distribution because there

58:37.420 --> 58:42.520
are some tools in that distro and there are applications that ship and pre-installed that

58:42.520 --> 58:46.740
other distros just simply don't install and just don't have at all.

58:46.740 --> 58:48.720
And so it's really unique.

58:48.720 --> 58:53.040
And I'm curious if that's enough, Al, to make you want to stick with it, because I think

58:53.040 --> 58:55.960
Jason's going for a full month on his challenge.

58:55.960 --> 58:58.400
Where are you at right now with that?

58:58.400 --> 59:03.240
So as of last Friday, I was already talking to Joe about what the next challenge was going

59:03.240 --> 59:04.240
to be.

59:04.240 --> 59:08.040
And if he had any insight through Choose Linux, kind of give me the little lowdown so I could

59:08.040 --> 59:09.840
go ahead and change.

59:09.840 --> 59:13.400
But now knowing that it's going to be a month, I think I'm going to stick through it because

59:13.400 --> 59:19.360
as much of a headache as it's been, it's rekindled my love for Linux and being able to troubleshoot

59:19.360 --> 59:23.040
and getting that high when you're actually able to figure something else out.

59:23.040 --> 59:27.200
I don't know if I'd recommend it to someone else, but with a little bit of Linux background,

59:27.200 --> 59:28.320
I think I can do it.

59:28.320 --> 59:30.520
Is your distribution working too well?

59:30.520 --> 59:31.520
Try OpenSea's Tumbleweed.

59:31.520 --> 59:36.280
Oh, that's not fair.

59:36.280 --> 59:40.920
Even though I just ragged on OpenSea for two very important points, that's not fair.

59:40.920 --> 59:45.000
For 90% of what OpenSea delivers, it works really well.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.360
No, I get it.

59:46.360 --> 59:51.880
I think it's a little bit unfair to say you could just use Ubuntu and you'll be okay.

59:51.880 --> 59:58.840
But I have to say, part of the problem with this is if you're running a rolling release

59:58.840 --> 01:00:04.080
on a distro that doesn't have a tremendously high number of desktop users, then when you

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:10.280
discover an interesting corner case bug, you may be the first one to hit it or one of tens

01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.160
of people who've hit it.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:16.300
Whereas with that, I'm not trying to sell Ubuntu, but when you're running something

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:21.260
like Ubuntu where there are millions of people doing it and the support channels are well

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:28.160
known easily searchable, chances are when you hit a problem statistically, other people

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.440
have seen it, other people have asked the question and answered the question online

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.080
and you can find a solution.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:38.600
When I had a problem with OpenSea and it cracked itself and I got a black screen on boot, I

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.920
went into the support channels and it was cobwebs.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.800
Nobody answered my question at all for hours and hours and hours.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.680
That's the problem.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:53.800
It's okay to have a technically excellent set of tools and awesome developers, but you

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:59.400
need support and you need users who are willing to help other users fix these problems.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:05.000
Elle found some wonderful people on Twitter to help her out, but you need more of them.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
That's the problem.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Yeah, you need a network effect.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.440
Right, and Fedora has that to a lesser extent than Ubuntu does, but we have an excellent

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:17.460
network of people, many channels of where people can reach out and get assistance with

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.940
stuff like that.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:20.940
That helps as well.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:26.040
That's one of the reasons why Fedora has been its geologic ages, as Matt Miller calls it,

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:30.280
has been actually growing taller with each Fedora release.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:36.160
I think that it's a good virtuous cycle of improvement there because you get these good

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.400
feedback from users who help each other and figure out how to pinpoint problems and they

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:44.400
give you quality feedback that you can then turn around and do better development, focused

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.840
development and stuff like that.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:50.520
Yeah, I mean, that is just one of the many benefits of the network effect.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.200
Let me check in with our local network here, Mr. Payne.

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.520
Did you walk away with any impressions trying it for a little bit?

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.520
I gave it a go on the server side.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.800
I have some thoughts about that, but I know you tried it out on the desktop side.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.920
I did, and Neil, I think you just said that very well.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.880
There are a lot of aspects that are just done differently in this ecosystem and it's kind

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.200
of refreshing.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:16.160
It does make me almost, when I was using Arch more, there was that feeling of, all right,

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.680
well, it's the Wild West and I got to figure my stuff out.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:22.480
And again, as El so eloquently said, it's exciting.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.480
There's a rush.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.720
You get all that understanding, you try to figure things out.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:28.280
So I actually had a lot of fun getting OpenSUSE set up.

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:32.280
I tried the network installer, which actually worked really well and was very straightforward.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:37.280
There were a couple little gotchas around like not being able to set up automatically

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.840
if I wanted snapshots enabled on the root FS, which I did, but otherwise it booted up

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.840
really fast.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.840
It was snappy.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.320
And honestly, I thought it looked pretty good.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:51.160
I mean, to be honest, it's the rolling distribution with the safety net, which makes it a ton

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.800
of fun to play around with.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:57.000
It's not really quite the right fit for me, but I can really appreciate what does make

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
it great.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.480
I had a few bumps when I tried to deploy it on the server.

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:02.120
I went kind of on a hunt.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.860
I was really hoping to find a custom image on like the OpenSUSE build service or something

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:10.160
that I could upload to DigitalOcean and run it there.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.520
I didn't find one.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:16.800
They do have a kind of like temporary version of the build service.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.400
If you go to build.opensuse.org, you'll see what I'm talking about.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:25.120
It's like a placeholder right now where you can pull down some template images for some

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.620
cloud providers.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:35.040
You can get Suse Linux Enterprise Server or OpenSUSE Leap 42.3 for AWS as an example.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:38.540
You can get Leap 15 as a Docker container.

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:43.400
So there are some options, but I was really hoping, what I was hoping is when I go to

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.520
this page where I thought it'd be great, it's like a click to deploy on Linode or click

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.100
to deploy on DigitalOcean and there's more providers now.

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.760
You can find it on Linode and a few other VPSs.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.320
In fact, there is an OpenSUSE Wiki page that lists some of the different VPS providers

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.880
and VM providers that offer OpenSUSE and the list is growing.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:06.000
Linode I think is probably the most prominent and I found it to be pretty simple if you

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.600
just want to do it that method.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.460
If you want to go download an ISO and then upload it to your cloud provider of choice,

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:15.200
I didn't really want to do much hosting on something like that, like on an AWS instance.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:20.620
So it was mostly kick the tires and remember how cool Ncurses tools are.

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:25.200
If you want to check out the challenges Elle has run into along her way, go check out the

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:32.680
link in the show notes linuxunplug.com slash 288 where she has documented all up on GitHub

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.520
the problems, the repo of problems as I called it.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.520
Good luck Elle.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.520
I hope you're going to stick with it.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:44.120
I hope it I hope by the end of it that you feel like having learned some of the tools

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.080
that it's it's a usable thing for you.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.760
But if you move on, nobody will blame you.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:56.120
I ran suce enterprise Linux for like six years on the server across more than 100 servers

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.200
and eventually migrated away from it.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.720
So sometimes it works for you for a while and it's time to move on.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.120
And no, no big deal.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.880
There's plenty of good Linux out there for everybody.

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:09.360
There's a Linux for all of us as part of what makes distro hopping so much fun.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.280
Just before we run, how about a couple of quick picks?

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.040
You know, I love me the markdown Wes.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:17.840
So I found me now that I'm all about the GTK apps again.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:22.120
This is what happens is I swing between desktops and then I find these apps as I switch back

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.760
to like a GTK desktop and then I want to share it with everybody.

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:27.320
And I found one called Uber rider.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.320
It's Uber for markdown.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.980
No, it's it's I just hate it when people say that.

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.800
So I just get someone delivered to my house who does all my writing for me.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.800
How does that work?

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800
Would that be great?

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:36.800
I would actually be.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.800
Hmm.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.800
Let's think about that.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.760
No, it's it's just a nice little GTK markdown writer called Uber rider.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.200
And it has some nice preview modes.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.760
It has some code completion.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.220
It has a focus mode.

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:49.220
It looks gorgeous.

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:50.680
The fonts are great.

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.960
All the things that you would expect from a modern markdown editor.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:58.380
It's definitely like it's one of the ones that I think Mac users would even drool at.

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.960
It's got math right there in it and a dark mode.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960
So sold.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.460
Heck yeah.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.460
You can find it.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:09.040
You can find it at uberrider.github.io or we'll have a link in the show notes.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.480
And then did you see this last one that I found?

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.040
I'm on a roll, Wes, with the pics again.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.040
Are you noticing this?

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.480
Like I'm on a pics roll right now.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.800
You've been killing it.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.560
And really what you're doing is bloating my hardware so I just don't have any space left

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.560
on my root partition.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:26.000
Legitimately, we had somebody email into the program and they were like, do you guys uninstall

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.280
all these things that you pick all the time or do you just let your install grow and grow

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:33.120
and for the most part, I just leave them installed really.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.000
Well half the time, we really like what we find.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
So what are you going to do?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Yeah.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Right.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
And then, you know, they're small.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Like this next one.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
How about this?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.440
Solitaire on the command line.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:48.800
With VI key bindings, no less, so you can actually get some work done in it.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.160
Oh, so you're trapped in the solitaire.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.000
Well Chris is trapped in the solitaire.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Yeah.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.500
No, until they have nano nano tear.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:58.500
It's not for me.

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.960
Definitely wouldn't wouldn't know what to do.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.380
Wouldn't know how to get out.

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:05.600
Maybe this might be a way to gamify you actually learning it.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:10.380
You know, the reality is like you can't you can't get away from it.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:16.120
The only editor that I have managed to truly and wholly avoid is Emacs.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:20.440
Like Vim just comes pre-installed on everything and sometimes, you know, an assist admins

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.440
got to edit a config file.

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.440
You know what I'm saying?

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:25.200
And I don't have time to install nano or maybe I don't have network yet and maybe that's

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.480
why I need my editor.

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.520
You're thinking about it wrong.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.600
You're thinking, Chris, because Emacs is an operating system, so you've been doing the

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.240
text editing, you need to switch OS over to the Emacs world.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:37.040
And here I was thinking you were going to say the only editor you've managed to avoid

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.040
is Ed.

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.040
Yeah.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.040
Nope, nope.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.040
You dead before.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:42.040
I've used Ed.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.040
But nano master race for me.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.040
That's I'm all about the nano.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.280
I will I will live and die in nano.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.280
All right.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.360
Links to everything we've talked about today in the show notes.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.960
Neil, where can people find more of what you do online?

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:55.200
Maybe your twiddle handle or a key hub or something like that?

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.200
Twitter is my is the main place where you can get in touch with me.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:05.560
I'm twitter.com slash DET underscore Conan underscore kudo DT short for detective.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:12.920
And on GitHub, I am Conan dash kudo and get lab on Conan underscore kudo.

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:15.200
It's basically some variation or permutation of that.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.080
I have the same avatar almost everywhere.

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.080
And I'm in most of the fedora development channels.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:24.000
I'm on in many of the different IRC channels for your open suits.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.120
I mean, the snappy channels, flat back channels, wherever, wherever the wind takes me.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.080
He's everywhere.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.520
He's everywhere.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:38.040
Of course, you can find poppy and wimpy over at a book to podcast.org.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:42.480
Rumor has it there's a meetup soon with details posted over there.

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.960
And should we say it, guys?

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:44.960
Are you ready?

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:45.960
Do you want to announce it?

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:48.280
Are you are we ready to are we ready to get news about Linux fest?

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:51.040
Yeah, you can say the word so excited.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.040
So excited.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.080
It is official.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:57.120
Poppy and wimpy will be at Linux fest Northwest 2019.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.960
Oh, you know what?

01:08:58.960 --> 01:08:59.960
That deserves it.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.960
There you go.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:01.960
That gets a real bell.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:02.960
That gets a real bell right there.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.960
Yeah.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960
Flights booked.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.880
And yeah, we're gonna come and have some fun with you guys.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.920
Get a high car, maybe get a convertible and have a road trip.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.680
But I've been looking at the high cars.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.320
I've been looking at the bigger and bigger and bigger ones.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.320
Might as well go big.

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:17.320
We're going to America.

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.320
We should do it properly, right?

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:20.160
Get the biggest truck we can find.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.800
There you do it.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.680
And you'll laugh as you fill it with gas.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:24.680
You'll laugh.

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:25.800
Look, and you'll call it gas.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.800
You'll call it gas.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:30.720
Gonna scream yee-haw out the window as we fire our guns in the air.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.720
That would be pretty good.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.800
I might even pay for the higher car for that.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.920
I think you'd probably fit in if you rented an RV.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:37.920
There you go.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.920
We'll go.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.920
We'll go.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.920
What do you call it over there?

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.920
Caravanning.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.920
We'll go caravanning.

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:43.920
That'd be excellent.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:44.920
Yeah.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:45.920
Go get more Westpane.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.920
He's over at techsnap.systems.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:53.520
A new revamped TechSnap now with Jim Salter from Ars Technica joining Wes every other

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.520
week.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.600
And a deep dive on QoS is coming up soon.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:57.600
I'm looking forward to that.

01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.600
So techsnap.systems.

01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.600
Slash subscribe.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.080
But what about the Twitter handle for you there, Wes?

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.080
You got one of those?

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.300
Oh, I sure do.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:08.560
Go find all the weird things I dredge up from the internet at Westpane.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.680
Who knew?

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.380
Who knew?

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.560
Any great snow pictures?

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.680
I feel like you'd be pretty good with the snow pictures, Wes.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.680
Oh, yeah.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.440
There's a barbecue here at the studio.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.800
And of course, all the dogs covered in snow.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.680
Oh, I'll have to go look.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.480
I'll have to go make a trip over to the old Westpane Twitter.

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.200
I'm over there too, at Chris LAS.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.600

Yeah, we're tired, exhausted, got all fired up for today's extra spicy episode, so please

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.320
help us.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.320
Wes, you didn't get on a soapbox.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.960
Do you want a quick Poe Show soapbox about something?

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:39.720
You know, like a local issue or something to do with dogs or...

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.440
Actually I'm feeling pretty happy this week.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.240
I think everything's going darn swell.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:48.760
I could get you on a soapbox if I gave you a burger and 50 bucks.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.840
I still don't think you'd step up on that soapbox.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:53.960
Popey, have you got a soapbox to get on?

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.400
Yeah, come on Popey.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:59.640
No, they don't have big enough soapboxes here for me to...

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.400
I'll break them.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:16.280
We got big ones here in the States though.
