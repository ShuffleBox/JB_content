00:00.000 --> 00:22.000
Hello, friends, and welcome to a very special edition of your weekly Linux talk show.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.000
My name is Chris.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.200
My name is Wes.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.440
And my name is Brent.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.760
Hello, gentlemen, looking very snazzy for today's special edition.

00:28.760 --> 00:33.240
No doubt everyone out there has been waiting all year for this episode.

00:33.240 --> 00:36.860
It's the second annual taxis as voted by our community.

00:36.860 --> 00:41.940
The votes have been coming in for weeks, and it is indeed time to reveal the results.

00:41.940 --> 00:46.040
So before we go any further, before we get into that, let's say time appropriate greetings

00:46.040 --> 00:47.040
to our virtual luck.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.040
Hello, mumble room.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.040
Hello, everyone.

00:49.040 --> 00:54.040
Thank you for being here.

00:54.040 --> 00:58.320
I didn't want to bring down the show with a little bit of bad news, but I just want

00:58.320 --> 01:03.760
to get this done real quick and then we'll get back to the taxis.

01:03.760 --> 01:09.920
I hate to say this, but I think we are going to postpone the January 2nd meetup.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.640
We're still going to go ahead with the moving up.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.280
We're still going to have a big live event.

01:13.280 --> 01:16.920
We're going to have Brent and Wes in studio.

01:16.920 --> 01:19.240
We're going to go ahead with the server thing.

01:19.240 --> 01:23.020
But what I am going to do, just because the numbers are not looking good right now when

01:23.020 --> 01:28.720
it comes to the Omicron variant, is I'm going to punt the meetup until the end of January,

01:28.720 --> 01:30.460
which also happens to be my birthday.

01:30.460 --> 01:35.140
So we'll just have a birthday party here at the studio on January 30th, unless things

01:35.140 --> 01:36.400
are looking even worse.

01:36.400 --> 01:40.080
And I thought about this and I asked our get together group and, you know, everybody felt

01:40.080 --> 01:41.600
pretty comfortable coming.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.320
I don't I don't think anybody was really too concerned.

01:44.320 --> 01:49.720
But there are elements of this that feel a little bit like end of December 2019, early

01:49.720 --> 01:53.800
first couple of months of January 2020, where we didn't really know, but things just kept

01:53.800 --> 01:56.280
getting worse and worse.

01:56.280 --> 01:57.840
And I thought about it.

01:57.840 --> 02:01.200
And if somebody came here and they got sick while they were here, I would just feel really

02:01.200 --> 02:02.200
awful about that.

02:02.200 --> 02:06.800
You know, I mean, our audience means a lot to me and I just don't want that to happen.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.440
So we'll play it safe for a little bit longer.

02:09.440 --> 02:13.040
And I feel so embarrassed about it because I've already punted this once.

02:13.040 --> 02:17.800
But I think it's just the way we have to just kind of be a little extra careful these last

02:17.800 --> 02:18.800
couple of years.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.920
So what we're going to do is we're going to have a big live event on January 2nd for the

02:22.920 --> 02:24.860
first LUP on a Sunday.

02:24.860 --> 02:29.320
We're going to launch the new server and then on January 30th, which I believe is a Sunday

02:29.320 --> 02:33.640
at the end of the month, which will be just around the old birthday where if I'm doing

02:33.640 --> 02:37.360
my math right, I think that's the big four oh for me.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.240
So it's going to be it's going to be a special event.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.200
So hopefully, hopefully we'll have fun.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.520
Hopefully things will be looking better and it'll be safe.

02:44.520 --> 02:49.720
And you know, just to make things a little less down, birthday presents are no longer

02:49.720 --> 02:51.720
strictly required for entry.

02:51.720 --> 02:52.720
Yeah, right.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.760
Yeah, there you go.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.240
Suggested, encouraged, but not required.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.240
No, no, no.

02:58.240 --> 02:59.420
Now everyone's off the hook.

02:59.420 --> 03:01.360
That's a great point.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.040
And we, I think we'll still have a good event.

03:04.040 --> 03:05.240
We'll still be a lot of fun.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.400
We'll have things ready to go.

03:06.400 --> 03:11.280
In fact, in some ways, because we won't be launching the server, it means we actually

03:11.280 --> 03:14.160
have, when I thought about it, it means, okay, well, then that means we'll have more time

03:14.160 --> 03:18.520
to focus on like, socializing and making food.

03:18.520 --> 03:23.200
You don't want to see like stressed out LUP crew instead of the happy go lucky LUP crew.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.480
They're very different.

03:25.480 --> 03:30.520
But first, we must thank our sponsor Linode, linode.com slash unplugged.

03:30.520 --> 03:34.240
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.760
And you go there to support the show.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.920
Linode is fast and reliable cloud hosting.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.800
I tell you that all the time.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.960
But a listener wrote into the show who's been listening for a while he's been using Linux

03:42.960 --> 03:44.280
since 2014.

03:44.280 --> 03:48.920
And he wrote, I recently moved two of my brother's business websites from a large shared hosting

03:48.920 --> 03:51.360
provider to a Linode VPS in my region.

03:51.360 --> 03:57.860
My initial load page times for his WordPress site went from 10 to 11 seconds to three to

03:57.860 --> 04:01.280
maybe 500 milliseconds.

04:01.280 --> 04:05.440
After that, I moved my personal and work websites.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.760
Website performance got better, but the big difference in speed was when I went to mount

04:09.760 --> 04:12.360
the web directories or SSH into them.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.260
Before it was taking me three to four seconds on my previous provider.

04:15.260 --> 04:19.960
But now with Linode, it's like I'm connecting locally.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.100
I know, right?

04:21.100 --> 04:24.440
What I love about Linode is when you jump on there and you go do an update, you know,

04:24.440 --> 04:27.640
you go do the old app, get update or DNF update.

04:27.640 --> 04:34.200
It pulls down those updates faster than your SSH screen can really give you the information.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.800
And the nice thing too is like I know Linode is all over this log for J vulnerability.

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
They've been tweeting about it.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.800
They've been updating their post.

04:39.800 --> 04:43.400
Their security team has been watching it from day one.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.400
And they're keeping people apprised.

04:44.400 --> 04:48.760
So if that's something you're concerned about right now with your infrastructure, Linode's

04:48.760 --> 04:49.760
on it.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.180
They have fantastic customer service.

04:51.180 --> 04:52.400
They have the best customer service.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.800
They don't do that escalation thing.

04:53.800 --> 04:58.240
You call in, you got a problem, you got an email, a ticket, a social or a call.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.280
They're going to stick with you until it's solved.

05:00.280 --> 05:03.680
And they're rolling out MVME PCI storage to a lot of their systems.

05:03.680 --> 05:09.440
So like the IOPS per gigabyte are just mind blowing now because on their high end CPU

05:09.440 --> 05:13.600
systems, they've also got AMD EPYC processors with 11 data centers around the world, you're

05:13.600 --> 05:16.720
going to find something close to you, a dashboard that's so straightforward, you're going to

05:16.720 --> 05:20.920
be impressed that somebody managed to engineer something so simple yet powerful and API and

05:20.920 --> 05:23.800
a command line tool that really helps you take it to the next level in one click deployments

05:23.800 --> 05:27.320
that can get you working on a project in just seconds.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.000
That's Linode in a nutshell.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
So go try it out.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.940
I've been telling you for a while, so why not take advantage of that hundred dollars?

05:32.940 --> 05:34.800
That's Linode saying, give it a real go.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.360
They're confident you're going to like it.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.600
And I am too.

05:37.600 --> 05:38.600
So go try it out.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.600
Linode.com slash unplugged.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.640
Get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

05:42.640 --> 05:50.320
And of course you support the show, Linode.com slash unplugged.

05:50.320 --> 05:54.760
It's the second annual Linux Unplugged Tuxies, and this year we've had a tremendous response

05:54.760 --> 06:00.040
with over 1500 unique respondents, helping us determine the best of the best, your favorite

06:00.040 --> 06:04.840
Linux distro, the best desktop environment, the newcomer that impressed you and the server

06:04.840 --> 06:10.520
distro that beat them all, and yes, the best open source service as voted by you.

06:10.520 --> 06:17.280
It is the 2021 Tuxies from the world's largest Linux podcast as voted by our community.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.960
Grace yourselves.

06:18.960 --> 06:24.920
Year two begins now.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.760
And we're going to start with our best newcomer project.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.800
This is probably the most controversial one, so we're going to get it out of the way right

06:30.800 --> 06:32.160
now.

06:32.160 --> 06:37.080
The best newcomer open source project or the projects became well known in 2021.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.480
Last year it was WireGuard.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.760
Third place this year is going to Garuda Linux.

06:42.760 --> 06:43.760
How about that?

06:43.760 --> 06:47.080
Oh, you know, it definitely had some good time on the show this year.

06:47.080 --> 06:51.640
I mean, you sort of sneakily dove in and revealed it to the world, and I just had to follow

06:51.640 --> 06:55.160
suit and I've still got it running here on at least one machine at home.

06:55.160 --> 06:59.400
And I would say we have heard from a pretty solid trickle of people after that episode

06:59.400 --> 07:00.800
that have been trying.

07:00.800 --> 07:04.320
What's funny about it is it's like everything's turned up to 11 with Garuda.

07:04.320 --> 07:08.880
The theme, the pre-config, like the patches.

07:08.880 --> 07:12.360
It's like Arch turned up to like full mode, like crazy mode, right?

07:12.360 --> 07:13.560
It's ultimate Arch really.

07:13.560 --> 07:16.280
Yeah, it's funny because in some sense it's like it's like too much.

07:16.280 --> 07:21.000
It's not really the customize everything stage of the Linux desktop that I'm really in right

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
now.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.720
But at the same time, it did rekindle a lot of that spirit and it's really pleasant to

07:26.720 --> 07:27.720
use.

07:27.720 --> 07:28.720
Yeah, it's fun.

07:28.720 --> 07:34.080
It's like when you just, you know, realize every now and then it's OK to have fun.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.080
You know, I have it set up on a machine and it's fun and that's totally OK.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.740
OK, the second place winner for the best newcomer project.

07:41.740 --> 07:45.440
This was the only free form submission.

07:45.440 --> 07:49.520
So we got a lot of submissions to this category, a lot.

07:49.520 --> 07:52.960
And what we did, we extracted all of them, Wes did.

07:52.960 --> 07:57.160
He extracted all of them to a CSV file, parsed it all, got all of it, and then we did another

07:57.160 --> 08:02.560
refresh this morning to make sure we have the absolute latest numbers.

08:02.560 --> 08:08.860
And I am really impressed by our second place because I don't remember the timeline exactly,

08:08.860 --> 08:12.140
but I'm pretty sure it came in around midpoint in the year at best.

08:12.140 --> 08:18.760
And our second place winner for the best newcomer project of 2021 is Quick MU from our buddy

08:18.760 --> 08:19.760
Wimpy.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.760
Can you believe it?

08:20.760 --> 08:23.240
Quick MU second place.

08:23.240 --> 08:24.240
It makes a lot of sense.

08:24.240 --> 08:30.260
I find this super impressive and I got to say, it brings a smile to me, I think because,

08:30.260 --> 08:35.340
you know, he's a friend and he always works hard and it's nice to see him get some recognition.

08:35.340 --> 08:40.920
But also on a personal level, I've been using this so slick and it just makes me all fuzzy.

08:40.920 --> 08:44.960
I don't know if you guys have spent much time with it, but it's just darn nice.

08:44.960 --> 08:45.960
That's true.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.040
It's come together really quick.

08:47.040 --> 08:51.320
You've seen a lot of support for the graphic environments being created under Flutter.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.040
It took off on Hacker News.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.380
So congratulations to Quick MU.

08:55.380 --> 08:58.040
But the first place project.

08:58.040 --> 09:02.800
This is this is impressive because we had, like I said, a lot of free form submissions.

09:02.800 --> 09:08.600
NTFS 3 from Paragon Software made it in the honorable mentions for this category.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.080
Silverblue and KinoKnight also got a lot of submissions.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.400
Yeah, really just a lot of Fedora in that regard.

09:14.400 --> 09:19.120
I mean, regular Fedora, some specific Fedora 35, but those immutable variants, a lot of

09:19.120 --> 09:20.340
love out there this year.

09:20.340 --> 09:23.280
Some love too for Asahi Linux and Alma Linux in there.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.100
A lot of people trying out Alma Linux this year.

09:26.100 --> 09:30.540
And Podman, Podman got a lot of mentions and some people in the comments said they felt

09:30.540 --> 09:33.500
like Podman really came into its own this year.

09:33.500 --> 09:40.740
But none of them, none of them received as many votes as our first place winner for the

09:40.740 --> 09:47.080
best newcomer project of 2021 or the one that changed things for you in 2021.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.440
It goes to PipeWire.

09:50.440 --> 09:55.640
PipeWire is the best newcomer project of 2021 by a by a big number, right?

09:55.640 --> 10:00.240
I think, Chris, maybe you were just like late at night voting on this one while people were

10:00.240 --> 10:01.600
sleeping.

10:01.600 --> 10:06.560
It impresses me that such a, I don't know, seemingly specific tool like an audio subsystem

10:06.560 --> 10:08.160
is at the top of the list.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.120
Tell me, why is this possible?

10:10.120 --> 10:14.300
You know, maybe in part because pulse audio issues were always a bit of a meme and PipeWire

10:14.300 --> 10:17.280
is the solution to those problems for a lot of people.

10:17.280 --> 10:21.300
It seems to me like the PipeWire project doesn't really expect average Linux users to really

10:21.300 --> 10:23.320
know what's happening or care what's going on.

10:23.320 --> 10:28.320
Like I don't think they realize the broad recognition the project is getting.

10:28.320 --> 10:31.720
These votes, they show people recognize the work being done.

10:31.720 --> 10:32.720
Okay.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.800
I mean, part of it has got to be the fact that we're a little obsessed, right?

10:35.800 --> 10:39.640
I mean, we talk about the thing just about every chance we can get.

10:39.640 --> 10:43.900
But but no, I mean, just, you know, in our matrix chat in Telegram, I feel like we've

10:43.900 --> 10:49.280
definitely seen folks who've who have solved issues that they had with pulse audio just

10:49.280 --> 10:50.280
by adding PipeWire.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.000
Plus, okay, we've been following the PipeWire story.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
We've built it up.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.940
Everyone knows the complicated background of audio on Linux, right?

10:57.940 --> 11:02.040
So I think there's just a lot of community hope around PipeWire and this year, well,

11:02.040 --> 11:05.080
with Fedora's help, like PipeWire is in the hands of a lot more people.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.740
Well, thank you PipeWire for making our shows even better.

11:08.740 --> 11:12.680
And now we go from probably the most controversial category because a lot of people, there was

11:12.680 --> 11:20.000
a broad spread there, to probably the category people are the most passionate about.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.160
And that, of course, believe it or not, is the text editor of the year.

11:26.160 --> 11:30.680
This is the one people always feel strongly about.

11:30.680 --> 11:35.640
And last year, Vim1, we'll start with third place this year.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.720
Nano came in at third place.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.520
Oh, hiss, oh, bias.

11:40.520 --> 11:41.520
What?

11:41.520 --> 11:45.640
Nano, my Nano peeps are repping a second year in a row.

11:45.640 --> 11:46.640
I got you.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.540
I mean, I think, okay, the noteworthy thing there are, all props to Nano, I'm glad it's

11:49.540 --> 11:53.480
useful for folks, Emacs has seriously fallen this year.

11:53.480 --> 11:58.080
I mean, like Nano did not beat Emacs last time around, but Emacs was down at seven or

11:58.080 --> 11:59.080
eight, I think.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.080
Mm-hmm.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.080
Mm-hmm.

12:01.080 --> 12:04.640
Well, Vim has fallen to second place.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.720
How about that?

12:05.720 --> 12:07.720
Did you ever think we'd see this?

12:07.720 --> 12:08.720
So here's the deal.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.080
Here's the way it works on the show.

12:10.080 --> 12:15.180
If a project wins two years in a row in a category, they go into the Hall of Fame.

12:15.180 --> 12:20.820
So if Vim had won best text editor of the year, it would be in the Hall of Fame.

12:20.820 --> 12:25.000
And it's essentially enshrined forever as a two-time winner.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.200
And then we vote on the remainers.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.200
It was a close one this year, that's for sure.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.640
It was, it was.

12:29.640 --> 12:33.720
So in a way, though, by Vim getting second place, it stays in the game for a little bit

12:33.720 --> 12:34.720
longer.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.760
So it does have a chance to be first place next year.

12:36.760 --> 12:43.820
But our first place winner for your favorite text editor of the year, I bet a lot of you

12:43.820 --> 12:49.880
are guessing it, it's VSCode.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.640
It's been a good year for VSCode.

12:52.640 --> 12:56.060
It's wild to me that this is a Microsoft project that's at the top of our list.

12:56.060 --> 13:03.500
It was a very, very close, it was by just like a couple of votes between Vim and VSCode.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.200
But it's, I think it's official.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.480
And I just got to sit with that for a moment.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.540
I've contributed to this.

13:08.540 --> 13:11.240
I didn't actually vote this year on the tuxes.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.080
But I have been using VSCode all year long.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.080
Oh, dang it.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.080
I didn't vote either.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.080
I meant to.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.360
But I didn't vote at all.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.360
We did not impact the results.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.360
But you're right.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.320
I mean, yeah, you've been using it.

13:23.320 --> 13:27.280
VSCode is my day-to-day editor, writing Python at work.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.320
I mean, I know Alex is using it.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.640
Brent, are you using it?

13:30.640 --> 13:32.200
I'm using it via Alex.

13:32.200 --> 13:35.400
He's teaching me some things, and he said, you must use VSCode.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.960
You can't use anything else for playing around.

13:37.960 --> 13:43.160
So I've gotten to maybe have it as an appetizer.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.160
OK.

13:44.160 --> 13:48.920
I would say keep an eye out for the tuxes next year if you disagree with these results.

13:48.920 --> 13:53.560
But in a way, Vim not winning this year does keep it in the game.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.480
Of course, the spread here is huge and wide.

13:56.480 --> 14:01.800
My K-Write and K-Editors did not get the representation I thought they should this year, unfortunately.

14:01.800 --> 14:02.800
I agree with you.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.800
Kate is my daily everything.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.200
So I don't know where it is.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.420
Come on, Kate folks.

14:08.420 --> 14:13.480
I think it's just the people who have adopted VSCode are just really passionate about VSCode.

14:13.480 --> 14:17.020
If you're curious, though, take a look at those Hector Martin live streams working on

14:17.020 --> 14:21.400
Asahi Linux, because, boy, he pushes Kate to the limit, I think.

14:21.400 --> 14:25.380
Hector Martin, the guy that's supporting, well, him and the Asahi Linux team that's

14:25.380 --> 14:30.240
supporting Linux to the M1, he makes, is it K-Write or Kate that he uses, Wes?

14:30.240 --> 14:31.240
I'm sorry.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.080
People will have to double check.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.360
But it's definitely a KDE text editor.

14:35.360 --> 14:39.760
Well, it's basically unrecognizable when you see it, because he's essentially turned it

14:39.760 --> 14:40.760
into an IDE.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.380
That's what he's done.

14:42.380 --> 14:43.400
It's very impressive.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.240
So I don't think that I don't think those projects get enough attention.

14:46.240 --> 14:52.080
But I think right now, VSCode is solving problems for people is what it is.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.080
And people are, you know, they're still adopting it.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.080
All right.

14:55.080 --> 14:59.040
Let's move to one of my favorite categories.

14:59.040 --> 15:05.600
This is one I always look forward to the best desktop distro for 2021.

15:05.600 --> 15:12.320
Last year, Fedora came in strong as after a good, strong year of releases.

15:12.320 --> 15:15.200
So let's start with third place this year.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.200
Is anybody surprised?

15:16.200 --> 15:17.620
I think this sounds pretty reasonable.

15:17.620 --> 15:18.620
It's Pop!

15:18.620 --> 15:19.620
OS.

15:19.620 --> 15:20.620
Congratulations to Pop!

15:20.620 --> 15:21.620
OS.

15:21.620 --> 15:22.620
You guys got third place.

15:22.620 --> 15:23.620
And they've done a lot.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.680
You know, this was even after that Linus video.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.360
So hey, good work.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.360
True.

15:28.360 --> 15:33.720
It didn't did not hurt them in the numbers when they had when they had the steam issues.

15:33.720 --> 15:38.240
Now our second place goes to OpenSUSE.

15:38.240 --> 15:41.800
What's interesting about that is that has shot way up in the charts.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.920
Wes, you might double check.

15:42.920 --> 15:49.080
But if I seem to recall, it performed fairly poorly, like it was way down in the charts

15:49.080 --> 15:50.080
last year.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.760
And now OpenSUSE is in the number two position.

15:53.760 --> 15:54.760
Wow.

15:54.760 --> 15:55.760
Even above Ubuntu.

15:55.760 --> 16:00.560
After we gave it a somewhat not so nice review earlier in the year.

16:00.560 --> 16:06.680
I was wondering if there's a correlation between how our opinion of OpenSUSE has changed throughout

16:06.680 --> 16:11.320
the year and the voting near the end of the year, just saying there might be maybe some

16:11.320 --> 16:12.320
influence there.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.320
I wonder.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.320
There could be.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.760
But this is desktop distro.

16:15.760 --> 16:19.680
And we've I've kind of all the whole time been like, I'm still not really sold on the

16:19.680 --> 16:21.000
desktop for SUSE.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.600
But seems the audience is.

16:22.600 --> 16:27.640
I got to say for my little dive into desktop OpenSUSE, I've been really loving it.

16:27.640 --> 16:32.580
And we've gotten a lot of feedback in the last few months of folks saying the exact

16:32.580 --> 16:34.160
same thing and giving us tips and tricks.

16:34.160 --> 16:40.440
So I could see how those who are listening would definitely throw some votes in.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.440
I think there's a strong audience there.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.320
And I'm glad to see this actually.

16:44.320 --> 16:50.360
Something tells me that in 2022, with us using evermore OpenSUSE on the server, we'll probably

16:50.360 --> 16:54.440
be drawn back in to play with the desktop a little bit here and there as well.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.360
I suppose that could happen.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.360
All right.

16:57.360 --> 17:02.380
Well, then let's reveal our first place winner as voted by our audience.

17:02.380 --> 17:07.900
We had 200 votes last year, and I was hoping to get to about 800 votes this year just to

17:07.900 --> 17:11.220
grow the number a little bit to widen the base of selection.

17:11.220 --> 17:14.500
And this year we had 1500 votes.

17:14.500 --> 17:18.840
So our community, this is starting to get a pretty good representation size.

17:18.840 --> 17:30.720
So 1500 people voted and the number one best Linux distro for 2021 is Fedora.

17:30.720 --> 17:35.460
For a second year in a row, congratulations, the Fedora project.

17:35.460 --> 17:37.760
This was a big win for you.

17:37.760 --> 17:43.100
And it also means you are now in the Tuxes Hall of Fame.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.680
We have our first Hall of Fame winner right here.

17:45.680 --> 17:50.440
It is Fedora, which means next year the first place position is going to open up.

17:50.440 --> 17:54.000
Suse could claim it or something else might fill that spot.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.280
Arch got more votes than Ubuntu this year, though.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.680
What is going on for Ubuntu on the desktop?

17:59.680 --> 18:02.000
I think that's been one of our questions across the year.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
I don't know.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.040
We've got, you know, got a big LTS coming up.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.360
I guess we'll see what 2022 will bring.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.360
Hmm.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.520
That might change things.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.520
You're right.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.120
That LTS could be a big win.

18:12.120 --> 18:14.000
It does seem like Fedora had a great year.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.880
I mean, we almost were talking about it every other show that they were doing something

18:18.880 --> 18:19.880
kind of neat.

18:19.880 --> 18:23.240
Wasn't Butter F.S. by default included this year or am I?

18:23.240 --> 18:24.240
That was last year.

18:24.240 --> 18:27.320
I think that's what started kicking off that, well, that's what I think kicked off the win

18:27.320 --> 18:28.320
last year.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.560
And they've held that momentum this year.

18:30.560 --> 18:34.180
The notoriety they got for that, they've kind of built something into each release that

18:34.180 --> 18:35.540
is building on top of that.

18:35.540 --> 18:37.260
And I think they've done that really well.

18:37.260 --> 18:41.160
And we should point out this was not like a squeaker win to get into the Hall of Fame.

18:41.160 --> 18:46.720
Okay, second place OpenSUSE had 11% of the votes with like 162 votes.

18:46.720 --> 18:52.160
Fedora had 46, that's 680 votes for Fedora.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.160
Oh my goodness.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.160
Yeah.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.160
They won.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.160
Yeah, I know.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.880
It's a strong vote of confidence from our audience.

18:58.880 --> 19:02.720
And I think that's telling that, you know, there's people out there recognizing the engineering

19:02.720 --> 19:04.400
work that's going into Fedora.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.900
SUSE also pretty interesting.

19:05.900 --> 19:10.320
And now Fedora in the Hall of Fame, that position opens up for others.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.320
So that is the desktop.

19:11.320 --> 19:16.120
And of course, we all know it's not where Linux makes its bread or its butter.

19:16.120 --> 19:20.600
No, no, it does that in the server market.

19:20.600 --> 19:25.320
So this is the category that really hits Linux in the pocketbook.

19:25.320 --> 19:31.040
The best server distro as voted by our community for 2021.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.720
A lot's changed in this space.

19:32.720 --> 19:36.640
And last year, Ubuntu was our number one winner.

19:36.640 --> 19:40.320
Third place this year is Debian, not too surprising.

19:40.320 --> 19:46.960
But what is surprising, I feel like there's kind of an upset in the mix.

19:46.960 --> 19:51.920
A newcomer comes in for best server distro of 2021.

19:51.920 --> 19:54.040
First time on the list, AlmaLinux.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.680
Congratulations AlmaLinux.

19:55.680 --> 20:00.440
Jack, I think the community is recognizing the hard work over there coming in at second

20:00.440 --> 20:05.360
place after just getting started, what really at the beginning of the year?

20:05.360 --> 20:06.840
You've never seen this happen before?

20:06.840 --> 20:09.680
Yeah, we're flattered.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.080
Thanks so much to the community.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.440
We do everything for you.

20:13.440 --> 20:17.520
So I'm glad that, you know, people like what we're doing.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.520
Absolutely.

20:18.520 --> 20:19.520
It's very impressive.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.560
Now we do have the first place to give away.

20:22.560 --> 20:26.000
This one I don't think is going to be too surprising because there's been a big shift

20:26.000 --> 20:27.440
in the market.

20:27.440 --> 20:32.520
People have moved around in response to the traditional CentOS release coming to an end.

20:32.520 --> 20:38.120
CentOS Stream got a very good showing, but it didn't get first place this year.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.800
But it does seem like people are really impressed with Stream.

20:40.800 --> 20:50.080
No, our first place winner for the best server distribution for 2021 is Ubuntu.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.280
Congratulations Ubuntu project.

20:52.280 --> 20:56.820
This is your second year in a row that you win.

20:56.820 --> 21:02.600
But I think Ubuntu had an even better showing this year because the feedback was, I thought

21:02.600 --> 21:06.440
about switching to CentOS Stream, I thought about switching to this or that, and I just

21:06.440 --> 21:07.920
decided to go to Ubuntu.

21:07.920 --> 21:13.160
And I, when Red Hat announced the transition for CentOS, I came on the air and I said nobody's

21:13.160 --> 21:16.880
going to go from a RHEL base to an Ubuntu base because of this change.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.120
It's just too much work.

21:18.120 --> 21:21.360
Well, apparently there's a lot of stubborn bastards out there in the audience because

21:21.360 --> 21:25.680
they've been making the switch this year and they showed up in the voting and it gave Ubuntu

21:25.680 --> 21:28.800
the win for the second year in a row for best server distro.

21:28.800 --> 21:34.080
It's interesting that maybe it's a different track that has been followed on the desktop,

21:34.080 --> 21:39.200
you know, I'm not surprised that Ubuntu remains dominant here, but it seems like that's one

21:39.200 --> 21:41.800
area that Canonical has continued to invest in, right?

21:41.800 --> 21:46.400
Like it feels much less stale on the server side than some of us might feel on the desktop.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.060
Yeah, I think that's it, Wes.

21:49.060 --> 21:53.800
The Alma initial release, Alma Linux initial release was eight months ago.

21:53.800 --> 21:54.920
How about that?

21:54.920 --> 22:00.000
To get second place in eight months in the server distro market vote?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.140
Wow, that's super impressive.

22:02.140 --> 22:07.240
And to see Ubuntu capitalize on the situation as well, double down on what they do best

22:07.240 --> 22:11.160
and have it represented in our vote, I think is, it's also, you're right, Wes, it kind

22:11.160 --> 22:13.920
of underscores their focus, doesn't it?

22:13.920 --> 22:14.920
This is where they're putting their attention.

22:14.920 --> 22:21.080
Well, it's that or people just run stuff in containers now and the server OS doesn't matter.

22:21.080 --> 22:22.960
Maybe also that, I'm not sure.

22:22.960 --> 22:23.960
All right.

22:23.960 --> 22:29.200
So we talked about distros, but what about desktop environments?

22:29.200 --> 22:32.000
So it's the best desktop environment of 2021.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.480
I don't care what distro you're running on.

22:34.480 --> 22:39.120
What desktop was the MVP for you, our audience this year?

22:39.120 --> 22:42.060
This is always interesting to watch the transitions.

22:42.060 --> 22:45.020
Last year, GNOME Shell won this category.

22:45.020 --> 22:46.020
Pretty interesting.

22:46.020 --> 22:51.840
I mean, I think you hear a lot of anti-gnome sentiment in the general, like a chattering

22:51.840 --> 22:55.960
social layer of the Linux community, but when it comes down to people actually getting their

22:55.960 --> 22:59.680
work done last year, they said, well, at the end of the day, it's GNOME Shell.

22:59.680 --> 23:03.300
And that does represent in the default desktop environment for a lot of distros.

23:03.300 --> 23:10.100
The upset this year is the third place position coming out of nowhere.

23:10.100 --> 23:16.440
Like a rocket, it's cosmic, cosmic, not even a full fledged desktop environment yet this

23:16.440 --> 23:17.440
year.

23:17.440 --> 23:18.440
Whoa.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.440
Isn't that something?

23:19.440 --> 23:21.960
Is that some of the excitement for what's going to come, I wonder?

23:21.960 --> 23:22.960
Yeah.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.320
Like people sort of a vote of, we like this direction, I guess.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.320
Yeah.

23:26.320 --> 23:30.980
It's sort of closest in the runnings with XFCE, but are those, those are opposites,

23:30.980 --> 23:31.980
I think.

23:31.980 --> 23:32.980
Yeah.

23:32.980 --> 23:38.400
So isn't that something too, when you look at the numbers, XFCE and MATE are basically

23:38.400 --> 23:40.700
slugging it out in the numbers.

23:40.700 --> 23:43.340
And it's been that way for a little bit.

23:43.340 --> 23:47.440
It seems to be that sort of an area where people are kind of split.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.920
There's an XFCE camp and there's a MATE camp.

23:49.920 --> 23:53.020
And so the numbers really get split between those two desktop environments.

23:53.020 --> 23:57.500
So the traditional desktop paradigm sort of has a split vote there and that does change

23:57.500 --> 23:58.500
things a little bit.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.240
So that brings cosmic up to third place.

24:00.240 --> 24:06.160
But I wonder too, if there's not a split between GNOME Shell and cosmic, one is born of the

24:06.160 --> 24:07.160
other.

24:07.160 --> 24:11.840
And so I'm curious if we have the numbers from last year's GNOME Shell ranking versus

24:11.840 --> 24:12.840
this year's.

24:12.840 --> 24:17.600
I mean, we've lost a little despite still getting probably, I would imagine good votes.

24:17.600 --> 24:18.600
Sure.

24:18.600 --> 24:19.600
Yeah.

24:19.600 --> 24:20.600
It was, it was GNOME 40 this year, right?

24:20.600 --> 24:22.720
It was a big transition year for GNOME.

24:22.720 --> 24:26.080
I could see that reaction in some of the votes a little bit.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.160
And I would imagine too, like you could see it change next year as people settle into

24:29.160 --> 24:30.280
the changes.

24:30.280 --> 24:31.900
That's going to be really interesting to watch.

24:31.900 --> 24:37.200
So plasma came in at second place again this year, and I really thought it was going to

24:37.200 --> 24:38.200
win it this year.

24:38.200 --> 24:43.920
I thought plasma would have it for sure because of these changes in the GTK GNOME ecosystem.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.960
I thought it was really going to be plasma.

24:45.960 --> 24:49.720
And it does have a solid contingent that shows up and votes for it each year.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.280
And I do think that gap has closed a bit in 2021.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.280
Oh yeah.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.280
Yeah.

24:54.280 --> 24:55.280
Good point.

24:55.280 --> 24:56.860
It's getting, see, that's interesting.

24:56.860 --> 25:00.880
Let's talk about that because I think plasma has been getting recognized in that chattering

25:00.880 --> 25:02.640
class a lot more.

25:02.640 --> 25:08.900
And if you look at the trends, it's possible plasma could take first place, especially

25:08.900 --> 25:12.720
when you consider what our first place winner was this year.

25:12.720 --> 25:22.600
So the best desktop environment of 2021, the MVP for our audience as voted is GNOME Shell.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.760
GNOME Shell wins it and enters the hall of fame.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.600
We've got a few hall of fame enters, enterers here.

25:27.600 --> 25:31.760
Congratulations GNOME Shell for entering the hall of fame.

25:31.760 --> 25:38.600
We acknowledge your popularity and thank you for a fantastic year from the team.

25:38.600 --> 25:45.520
And it opens up the possibilities for next year's Tuxes as well.

25:45.520 --> 25:47.680
That's really something GNOME Shell, you guys did it again.

25:47.680 --> 25:53.160
I thought plasma would catch up to you this year, but the GNOME heads, they still showed

25:53.160 --> 25:54.160
up for you.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.960
See, pressure's off now for 2022.

25:55.960 --> 26:00.280
So you can fix all the stuff, maybe a multi-threaded, I don't know.

26:00.280 --> 26:03.040
And then, you know, in a few years you can come back for another shot.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.040
Oh my God.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.040
No, I'm kidding.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.040
Brutal.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.040
Brutal.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.040
All right.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.040
Okay.

26:09.040 --> 26:14.660
We got to, we got to move along, maybe get a little more meta here.

26:14.660 --> 26:18.760
What was the largest impact in open source this year?

26:18.760 --> 26:22.640
What project changed the universe for open source?

26:22.640 --> 26:26.560
There was a wide range here to pick from, a lot's going on in our community.

26:26.560 --> 26:30.800
And last year our audience voted the Linux kernel.

26:30.800 --> 26:35.780
Now looking at the very, very, very fresh numbers, we have an interesting situation.

26:35.780 --> 26:39.880
So I'll tell you what got third place this year, WireGuard.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.400
WireGuard got third place this year.

26:41.400 --> 26:45.360
People are still very excited about WireGuard, came out last year, but this was the year

26:45.360 --> 26:46.880
people implemented it.

26:46.880 --> 26:50.200
And I think this is the year it started changing people's workflow.

26:50.200 --> 26:54.680
And that showed up in the numbers and gave WireGuard a good showing into its second year.

26:54.680 --> 26:55.680
Yeah.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.840
I mean, like not only can you just use it by itself, but there's projects that build

26:58.840 --> 27:03.560
on it like tail scale and even a whole bunch of commercial VPN services now offer it just

27:03.560 --> 27:05.560
right along with open VPN.

27:05.560 --> 27:10.440
Now we got a situation you guys, because we've got a tie at the first place.

27:10.440 --> 27:13.520
Just of course we had to go get the most current numbers and screw this up because we did have

27:13.520 --> 27:16.080
a clear winner, but I actually like it.

27:16.080 --> 27:22.480
So initially our first place winner for the open source project that had the biggest impact

27:22.480 --> 27:25.280
this year was PipeWire.

27:25.280 --> 27:29.520
Initially our audience is very hyped about PipeWire because it's already won a category,

27:29.520 --> 27:30.520
right?

27:30.520 --> 27:32.400
It got the best newcomer already.

27:32.400 --> 27:33.400
Yeah.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.760
In the most competitive category with a whole bunch of different entrants.

27:36.760 --> 27:37.760
Right.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.480
Where things like the Linux kernel won last year, right?

27:40.480 --> 27:44.220
So we're talking, this is a category.

27:44.220 --> 27:50.120
And so PipeWire was our winner, but when we check the votes right now as we go live, it

27:50.120 --> 28:01.240
is tied neck and neck, 26% between PipeWire and the winner for this category, Proton.

28:01.240 --> 28:05.360
383 votes, 26% of the votes for Proton.

28:05.360 --> 28:10.240
Since we have a tie here and PipeWire won the last category, I say we give it to Proton

28:10.240 --> 28:13.960
in this category because this was a big year for Proton.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.440
Pretty much no question about that.

28:16.440 --> 28:20.800
It's really nice to see WireGuard and PipeWire on this list.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.080
That's great.

28:22.080 --> 28:25.440
But no doubt Proton should be somewhere on this.

28:25.440 --> 28:32.840
And right before we went live, G-Hacks Tech News ran an article that says now 75% of the

28:32.840 --> 28:37.960
top 100 games on Steam now run on Linux.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.720
In fact, that's the top 1000 games.

28:40.720 --> 28:45.200
If you zoom in at the top 100 games, it's actually 80%.

28:45.200 --> 28:50.000
Ironically, if you go to the top 10, it actually gets a little bit worse, it's down to 40%.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.600
But looking at the top 100 games, it's an 80% coverage now.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.920
And that is in big part because of Proton.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.140
That's today, right?

28:58.140 --> 29:00.560
That's right now as we record.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.100
The deck launches in just a few months.

29:03.100 --> 29:06.400
And I think Proton is an absolute linchpin for the deck, right?

29:06.400 --> 29:09.920
The deck wouldn't exist without Proton and this could open up a whole new category for

29:09.920 --> 29:11.120
Valve.

29:11.120 --> 29:15.120
So unless you guys disagree, I think we give it to Proton this year.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.520
No, it seems fitting, right?

29:16.520 --> 29:21.840
Like this sets things up as a category to watch for 2022 because, well, one, it's deserved

29:21.840 --> 29:26.300
now but the next year, that's going to be the test and it could either be an amazing

29:26.300 --> 29:31.240
Hall of Fame entry if things go well, or a dramatic shakeup.

29:31.240 --> 29:32.240
Yeah.

29:32.240 --> 29:36.680
Or it may show up in the numbers next year as the deck because I would imagine the Steam

29:36.680 --> 29:39.380
deck is going to be one of the entries that's going to be possible.

29:39.380 --> 29:44.160
So congratulations to Proton.

29:44.160 --> 29:47.200
You get the tiebreaker this year as voted by our hosts.

29:47.200 --> 29:51.520
And I think it's going to be, I think it's going to be a good year for Proton next year

29:51.520 --> 29:52.520
as well.

29:52.520 --> 29:59.020
We have two more categories left, so let's do the second to last category now.

29:59.020 --> 30:01.960
This is a new one for the Tuxes.

30:01.960 --> 30:05.240
There is no last year winner because we decided to kick it off this year.

30:05.240 --> 30:14.640
It is the best hosted or self-hosted open source service of the year.

30:14.640 --> 30:17.380
Third place went to GitLab, which makes a lot of sense.

30:17.380 --> 30:19.160
That is an absolute winner of a tool.

30:19.160 --> 30:22.280
So third place goes to GitLab.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.280
Second place.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.320
Now this doesn't have to be something you self-host.

30:25.320 --> 30:30.280
This could be something that you go subscribe to but is powered by open source software.

30:30.280 --> 30:36.000
So second place went to the Matrix ecosystem and the Element chat app, which I totally

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
agree with.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.120
First time they've showed up here.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.120
Congratulations to them.

30:39.120 --> 30:41.400
We've got a thriving Matrix community right now.

30:41.400 --> 30:42.520
Yeah, we sure do.

30:42.520 --> 30:45.560
And I mean, there's just a lot of developments and updates.

30:45.560 --> 30:50.700
And I'm sure if we went back a year, the Element and Matrix ecosystem experience would have

30:50.700 --> 30:52.420
been fairly different.

30:52.420 --> 30:56.100
And I'm sure a year from now that will remain the same, you know, like it's going to see

30:56.100 --> 30:57.100
more improvements.

30:57.100 --> 30:59.280
It's going to be a better service, a better system.

30:59.280 --> 31:02.400
And hey, maybe we'll even have some new backend servers that perform a little better.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.840
Yeah, we might be on that new one.

31:04.840 --> 31:08.120
We might be off Synapse by this time next year.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.120
All right.

31:09.120 --> 31:12.880
Well, we do have a first place winner.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.920
It was a very close call between Matrix and the Matrix ecosystem.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.800
So we did kind of make it broad.

31:18.800 --> 31:20.360
And our first place winner.

31:20.360 --> 31:23.760
But our first place winner did edge out just by a bit.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.680
So it's a fair win.

31:25.680 --> 31:35.240
Ladies and gentlemen, the best service of the year as voted by our audience, Flat Hub.

31:35.240 --> 31:39.560
Flat Hub wins first place as one of the best services for the community.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.380
And I completely agree.

31:41.380 --> 31:46.120
This was the year that I started going to Flat Hub to discover what new apps are out

31:46.120 --> 31:47.680
for the Linux desktop.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.120
That's massive, man.

31:49.120 --> 31:53.640
That's a high watermark for me because that is a job I have been doing for 15 years, right?

31:53.640 --> 31:58.160
I've been looking for places that always give me the latest application updates.

31:58.160 --> 32:02.560
And I've switched over the years to different places as like my source and Flat Hub is now

32:02.560 --> 32:03.560
one of them.

32:03.560 --> 32:07.120
And it's great to see somebody collecting and getting adoption like that, too.

32:07.120 --> 32:08.600
It's just so great.

32:08.600 --> 32:13.280
Well, and we've seen more and more app stores on various distributions and variants sort

32:13.280 --> 32:18.200
of tie in directly or automatically with Flat Hub or just make it simpler to do so.

32:18.200 --> 32:23.240
And I think for many of us, it's now, if not the default, one of the default ways that

32:23.240 --> 32:24.240
you're acquiring software.

32:24.240 --> 32:27.800
You know, I load a new machine, I get Flat Pack set up, I go over to Flat Hub and install

32:27.800 --> 32:31.480
some of the apps that I know that I just need by default.

32:31.480 --> 32:36.440
And it's always there like, okay, I don't have stats on this, but it works whenever

32:36.440 --> 32:37.440
I need it there.

32:37.440 --> 32:40.080
And I think it's nice to be a little grateful that there's, you know, this is a service

32:40.080 --> 32:42.000
being provided to us for free.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.880
I wonder if we'll see them monetize.

32:43.880 --> 32:47.800
That may be a hint at one of my future predictions, which is next week.

32:47.800 --> 32:53.840
But I think also for a lot of us, not obviously in Linux, there's never consensus 100%.

32:53.840 --> 33:00.000
But for a lot of us, it feels like Flat Packs really just kind of became the go to solution

33:00.000 --> 33:01.640
for desktop software.

33:01.640 --> 33:05.840
I mean, maybe that kind of correlates with the Fedora adoption and Fedora trend.

33:05.840 --> 33:10.280
It just becomes so simple to install so many things like a lot of the crap stuff I have

33:10.280 --> 33:14.160
to have to interact with humans and do work stuff is just in Flat Packs now.

33:14.160 --> 33:18.600
And I'd actually prefer for some of those things to be in a Flat Pack, if you know what

33:18.600 --> 33:19.600
I mean.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.520
Like Zoom, I'm looking at you.

33:21.520 --> 33:26.880
So I think it's good to have Flat Pack and Flat Hub, you know, as connected to Flat Hub.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.520
I think it's nice to see that represented on this list.

33:28.520 --> 33:31.000
So I'm actually really glad they got this win.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.160
Which brings us to our last category.

33:34.160 --> 33:38.360
This is a special category.

33:38.360 --> 33:41.160
This is something we open up to the audience.

33:41.160 --> 33:47.580
You send in your recommendation to Uncle Brent's mailbag at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

33:47.580 --> 33:52.240
He reaches in that mailbag and rifles through and gets a few honorable mentions for us.

33:52.240 --> 33:56.480
So Brent, what do you got in your honorable mentions bag?

33:56.480 --> 33:58.700
Yeah, we got a whole bunch of stuff.

33:58.700 --> 34:01.240
And we may not have been able to mention all of them.

34:01.240 --> 34:06.440
But I gotta say, most of what we got in there were text editors, which maybe you're not

34:06.440 --> 34:07.440
surprised by.

34:07.440 --> 34:14.120
But it just shows to me that there's such a love for where we spend our time writing

34:14.120 --> 34:17.320
maybe the simplest stuff that ends up being quite strong for us.

34:17.320 --> 34:22.920
So one of the mentions was fertility, which I hadn't heard of, but it's a terminal text

34:22.920 --> 34:26.280
editor that tries to be super intuitive.

34:26.280 --> 34:30.960
It says on their website, the main audience fertility is users who normally work in GUI

34:30.960 --> 34:35.440
environments, but sometimes require an editor for a console or terminal environment.

34:35.440 --> 34:39.440
So I thought of you right away, Chris, and myself, actually, I'm a huge nano fan like

34:39.440 --> 34:44.260
you, only because I don't spend that much more time in any of the other ones than and

34:44.260 --> 34:45.860
I don't necessarily want to.

34:45.860 --> 34:50.020
And you're a gentleman who recognizes quality and elegance makes sense.

34:50.020 --> 34:55.440
So that was Philip that wrote in and he suggested the following when he wrote in, I just love

34:55.440 --> 35:00.400
it, he says not because it is the most efficient or anything, but till the looks and functions

35:00.400 --> 35:06.900
a lot like the old dos edit.com, and it transports me back to when I was a kid and all our computers

35:06.900 --> 35:10.780
at home ran dos somehow that makes me happy, he writes.

35:10.780 --> 35:15.200
And so I love using Tildy just because it makes me nostalgic and has become one of the

35:15.200 --> 35:20.000
first programs I always install when setting up a new Linux machine.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.480
I thought that was a really nice anecdote.

35:22.480 --> 35:26.040
That's a good angle to like if you connect with a piece of software that you like using

35:26.040 --> 35:30.000
you there's something about it that just like clicks with your monkey brain and just go

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
with it.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.240
You know, just roll with that because then you're going to open that thing up, you're

35:33.240 --> 35:36.120
going to be more inclined to take notes, it just reduces friction a little bit.

35:36.120 --> 35:37.320
So I love it.

35:37.320 --> 35:40.980
So that was Tildy, T-I-L-D-E, right?

35:40.980 --> 35:41.980
Which is a terminal text editor.

35:41.980 --> 35:43.520
We've got a couple others though.

35:43.520 --> 35:46.800
A couple other text editors, that is.

35:46.800 --> 35:51.800
We had Aiko and Robin write in suggesting micro text editor, supposed to be a modern

35:51.800 --> 35:53.440
and intuitive terminal text editor.

35:53.440 --> 35:56.720
And I got to say the screenshots that I saw look super nice.

35:56.720 --> 35:59.000
So I have not used it.

35:59.000 --> 36:01.200
Wes, have you given this a try at all?

36:01.200 --> 36:02.880
No, you know, I've seen it floating around.

36:02.880 --> 36:08.360
I've not tried this one, but it does look pretty nice and I'm glad to see support out

36:08.360 --> 36:09.640
there in the audience for it.

36:09.640 --> 36:10.640
Heck yeah.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.960
Perhaps I'll give it a try over the holidays.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.400
Glenn wrote in about CUDA text.

36:14.400 --> 36:18.120
So you got to give that one a try if you're a cross platform person who likes to have

36:18.120 --> 36:21.000
a code editor written in an object Pascal.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
Okay.

36:22.000 --> 36:27.280
And then, you know what, Sway, if this wasn't on our list, probably should have been.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.560
Joseph and Robin wrote that in, they're right.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.240
Sway should have been on there.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.720
That we should probably make sure that gets on there next year.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.640
A bit of a miss on our part, I think.

36:36.640 --> 36:42.960
Also we got some text in suggesting that for best distro, we missed something as well.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.240
We missed listing NixOS.

36:45.240 --> 36:46.640
Robin said it should be on the list.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.880
They seem to have had a year of growth.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.280
Oh, you know what?

36:50.280 --> 36:53.480
Let's give them an honorable mention right now because that's true.

36:53.480 --> 36:57.360
NixOS gets an honorable mention in the tuxes this year because they have had a great year.

36:57.360 --> 37:00.480
I've heard more people talking about them than ever.

37:00.480 --> 37:06.400
I feel like this is a, I don't know, greatest hits of 2021, you know, it's a double album

37:06.400 --> 37:08.600
and we just get to sit back and enjoy the whole thing.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.280
This is, I'm loving this.

37:10.280 --> 37:13.960
I mean, we used to like do recaps of the year and stuff, but then I realized this is way

37:13.960 --> 37:14.960
more fun.

37:14.960 --> 37:15.960
Isn't it?

37:15.960 --> 37:16.960
Yeah.

37:16.960 --> 37:20.240
And NixOS is going to have to be on the list next year.

37:20.240 --> 37:25.000
So Tim wrote in to let us know that Nextcloud wasn't on there, even though we were doing

37:25.000 --> 37:28.800
the entire survey in Nextcloud, which actually turned out to work really good.

37:28.800 --> 37:31.760
Yeah, that's kind of embarrassing.

37:31.760 --> 37:36.040
And one of the great things about Nextcloud is we hemmed and hawed about this because

37:36.040 --> 37:39.760
like, well, we don't really want to make our Nextcloud instance public.

37:39.760 --> 37:43.880
Then Wes was like, well, I could just go spin one up in like 30 seconds and we just could

37:43.880 --> 37:45.320
do it because it's free software, right?

37:45.320 --> 37:46.840
And it takes no time on Linode.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.320
So we did just that.

37:48.320 --> 37:52.880
We just spun up a Nextcloud for the tuxes and it was something that was safe and on

37:52.880 --> 37:53.880
its own island.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.000
And it's really nice for that kind of stuff.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.040
And now we've been using it for over two years as our way of syncing our editing stuff and

38:01.040 --> 38:04.520
all of our clips and stuff between the hosts and the editors and all that kind of stuff.

38:04.520 --> 38:07.600
So honorable mention to the Nextcloud project as well, I say.

38:07.600 --> 38:08.600
What do you guys think?

38:08.600 --> 38:09.600
No.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.600
Yeah, I think that's definitely true.

38:10.600 --> 38:16.160
Look, we've complained about it a fair amount and there are things that it could definitely

38:16.160 --> 38:17.360
still improve on.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.960
But at the same time, it really has kind of become this background infrastructure.

38:20.960 --> 38:24.720
It doesn't take a huge cost to keep it up to date or maintain it or any issues on that

38:24.720 --> 38:25.760
side.

38:25.760 --> 38:29.400
And it has enabled the team to collaborate in many real ways.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.400
Yeah.

38:30.400 --> 38:34.240
I kind of feel like the magic bullet there was using object storage on the back end.

38:34.240 --> 38:36.880
So that way we're not running out of disk space on the regular.

38:36.880 --> 38:37.880
Well done.

38:37.880 --> 38:38.880
Good choice.

38:38.880 --> 38:43.520
I got to say for myself personally, it's like the underpinning of my whole digital existence

38:43.520 --> 38:47.760
that keeps me organized and keeps me connected to people, especially if you're trying to

38:47.760 --> 38:48.960
do the de-Google thing.

38:48.960 --> 38:55.400
It feels maybe like Nextcloud has become a bit boring in the last year or two, only because

38:55.400 --> 38:58.160
they become stable and everything just works as expected.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.440
And I think that's actually a really good thing.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.200
They've come out certainly with some features.

39:02.200 --> 39:05.960
But for me, it's just like, it just works these days.

39:05.960 --> 39:08.440
And I was thinking about it.

39:08.440 --> 39:12.300
I think that's maybe one of the pieces of software that's the most important for me

39:12.300 --> 39:16.040
in an everyday lifestyle, if I can put it that way.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.040
Wow.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.040
Well, then let's make it official.

39:18.040 --> 39:21.720
Honorable mention locked in.

39:21.720 --> 39:22.720
Nextcloud.

39:22.720 --> 39:23.720
Thank you, guys.

39:23.720 --> 39:24.720
That's really...

39:24.720 --> 39:25.720
I agree.

39:25.720 --> 39:26.720
I'm glad we got those in.

39:26.720 --> 39:27.720
LinuxUnplugged.com.

39:27.720 --> 39:29.960
Contact if you have feedback about the Tuxes.

39:29.960 --> 39:30.960
We'll start collecting them.

39:30.960 --> 39:34.600
And really what we should do, and I meant to do it this year, but time always gets the

39:34.600 --> 39:35.600
better of me.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.600
Yeah.

39:36.600 --> 39:37.760
It's a gradual process to improve this.

39:37.760 --> 39:38.760
Yeah.

39:38.760 --> 39:39.760
Yeah.

39:39.760 --> 39:40.760
We're going to do it.

39:40.760 --> 39:41.760
We're going to continue to refine it.

39:41.760 --> 39:42.760
We appreciate it.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.840
And then one of the things I'd love to do is put an early version of the list out and

39:45.840 --> 39:48.640
maybe get some feedback on it.

39:48.640 --> 39:53.040
We did workshop the list a little bit with the virtual logs, so we did run some passes

39:53.040 --> 39:54.040
over.

39:54.040 --> 39:57.340
But I'd like to do one with a general audience, too.

39:57.340 --> 39:59.080
That requires that we're way ahead of the game, right?

39:59.080 --> 40:01.760
Because you think you got to start thinking about that kind of thing a solid couple of

40:01.760 --> 40:03.040
months before.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.040
But we're going to try.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.040
Yeah.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.040
End of summer, maybe, we get started.

40:06.040 --> 40:07.040
Yeah.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.040
Probably, right?

40:08.040 --> 40:10.580
It actually also feels like a good problem to have that there are so many projects that

40:10.580 --> 40:14.040
we're sort of losing track of even some of the best ones.

40:14.040 --> 40:18.400
So I think that speaks volumes for the open source community.

40:18.400 --> 40:19.400
It's pretty great.

40:19.400 --> 40:22.520
Also, I want to say thank you to our members, UnpluggedCore.com.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.400
Some of the best bits are the stuff that we stream live that don't make it in the final

40:25.400 --> 40:26.400
edit.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.400
It's just the way it goes.

40:27.400 --> 40:28.780
It's human nature.

40:28.780 --> 40:33.200
If I could do one thing, it would be capture those things just natively in a show.

40:33.200 --> 40:36.680
But what happens is when you stop recording, people relax.

40:36.680 --> 40:38.200
And they know we're streaming.

40:38.200 --> 40:41.060
But it's just different when the disk space isn't being burned.

40:41.060 --> 40:43.160
And that's what goes into the member feed.

40:43.160 --> 40:44.200
It's pretty great.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.760
You can support the show directly at UnpluggedCore.com.

40:46.760 --> 40:47.960
Or you can get a totally ad free.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.720
It's still got all the great Joe production on it.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.760
But it's just 100% ad free now.

40:51.760 --> 40:52.920
That's new.

40:52.920 --> 40:55.040
And we've also launched a network wide membership.

40:55.040 --> 40:58.820
So if you're already listening to a couple of shows, why not just get the membership?

40:58.820 --> 41:04.480
Because for right now, until the end of this year, for less than the cost of two show memberships,

41:04.480 --> 41:08.320
when you go to Jupiter.party, you can sign up, support all the shows and get access to

41:08.320 --> 41:11.820
all the special feeds from every single show, including this one.

41:11.820 --> 41:15.420
And it's the only way to get Linux action news totally ad free.

41:15.420 --> 41:18.660
So that is Jupiter.party for that one.

41:18.660 --> 41:20.300
And thank you everybody who's been signing up.

41:20.300 --> 41:22.600
That's been really nice to see.

41:22.600 --> 41:27.280
And I hope that as we add more content down the road, you'll just get more and more value

41:27.280 --> 41:28.280
out of that.

41:28.280 --> 41:30.880
But that does wrap up the 2021 Tuxies.

41:30.880 --> 41:34.360
Don't forget our Luplug is every Sunday.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.560
And we'll be going on Tuesdays.

41:36.560 --> 41:39.200
Details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

41:39.200 --> 41:42.240
We have one more live Tuesday.

41:42.240 --> 41:45.440
It's our predictions and our results from this year.

41:45.440 --> 41:51.360
Join us for the last Tuesday, then we're moving to Sunday, 12pm Pacific, 3pm Eastern.

41:51.360 --> 41:53.440
Linuxunplug.com for our links.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.440
Thanks so much for joining this week.

41:54.440 --> 42:08.440
And for one last time, we'll see you next Tuesday.
