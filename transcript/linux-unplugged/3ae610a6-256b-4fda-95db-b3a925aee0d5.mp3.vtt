WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
Holy smokes, Wes, look alive.

00:04.520 --> 00:07.040
It's perfect timing for Linux Unplugged today.

00:07.040 --> 00:11.140
We are going to be getting into a conversation around different methods of crowdfunding open

00:11.140 --> 00:16.880
source projects, and one of the titans of Kickstarter has launched their brand new Kickstarter

00:16.880 --> 00:18.300
project today.

00:18.300 --> 00:21.200
They're not struggling, though, Wes.

00:21.200 --> 00:28.760
They have already raised, of a goal of a million, four million, oh boy, 22,000 backers with

00:28.760 --> 00:30.720
36 days left to go.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.760
They're only a few hours into this thing.

00:32.760 --> 00:35.560
It's the new Pebble 2, Time 2, and the Pebble Core.

00:35.560 --> 00:37.800
Hey, Kickstarter.

00:37.800 --> 00:38.800
We're Pebble.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.800
Hey there.

00:39.800 --> 00:44.120
In 2012, we came to you with an idea called a smartwatch.

00:44.120 --> 00:49.320
Your incredible support helped Pebble smash Kickstarter records not once, but twice, and

00:49.320 --> 00:51.880
ushered in a revolution in wearable technology.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.120
OMG, OMG, OMG.

00:53.120 --> 00:58.080
Today, we've come home to Kickstarter to push these boundaries even further.

00:58.080 --> 01:04.400
Introducing Pebble 2, a sporty, ultra-affordable smartwatch with a built-in heart rate monitor.

01:04.400 --> 01:10.800
Time 2, a premium smartwatch for the active professional, and Pebble Core, an entirely

01:10.800 --> 01:15.000
new device for runners that connects to your cellular network and fits in the palm of your

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
hand.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Hey, gang.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
It's time to write the next chapter in wearables.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Am I part of gang?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
I want to be in the gang.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.320
Yeah, we're in the gang, dude.

01:22.320 --> 01:26.540
Pebble 2 is our latest smartwatch, now with built-in activity tracking.

01:26.540 --> 01:29.920
So they got the new watch, now hold on, because this isn't the one you're interested in.

01:29.920 --> 01:34.180
But it's neat that it has real-time heart rate all the time.

01:34.180 --> 01:35.180
It's waterproof.

01:35.180 --> 01:38.040
It does microphones so you can do dictation.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.040
That's all neat.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.040
But oh boy.

01:40.040 --> 01:44.740
And with a single click, Pebble 2 is an all-around amazing smartwatch.

01:44.740 --> 01:48.640
And starting at just $99, it's the most affordable smartwatch ever.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.800
All right, so that's the Pebble 2.

01:50.800 --> 01:51.800
But now...

01:51.800 --> 01:57.800
We're excited to announce Time 2, our all-new premium full-color smartwatch.

01:57.800 --> 02:02.440
Machined from marine-grade stainless steel in gold, black, or silver, Time 2 introduces

02:02.440 --> 02:08.400
a crisp new color e-paper display that's 53% larger than the original and packs twice the

02:08.400 --> 02:12.320
text on screen, keeping you up to date at a glance.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.000
Time 2's battery lasts up to 10 whole days on a single charge.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.640
Now that is amazing.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.640
10 days?

02:18.640 --> 02:19.640
Wow.

02:19.640 --> 02:25.840
And like Pebble 2, it has a mic, heart rate monitor, and is water-resistant to 30 meters.

02:25.840 --> 02:29.160
Both watches also feature an updated version of Pebble Health.

02:29.160 --> 02:33.900
Now you can tell Pebble your activity and fitness goals, and it sets targets that automatically

02:33.900 --> 02:36.040
adjust based on your performance.

02:36.040 --> 02:41.080
Now they also have the new Pebble Core, which is basically just a voice-activated push-button

02:41.080 --> 02:42.960
little activity tracker.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.960
Pebble's getting big into fitness, huge into fitness.

02:45.960 --> 02:50.160
So you could leave your phone at home.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.680
I like that.

02:51.680 --> 02:54.600
Core streams music from Spotify to keep you motivated.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.240
So that's kind of a neat thing.

02:56.240 --> 03:00.880
So we're going to be talking about this today, and not necessarily the Pebble, but I think

03:00.880 --> 03:03.520
it's really interesting timing for some of the subjects we're getting into, Wes.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.520
Are you ready to get started?

03:05.520 --> 03:06.740
Oh yeah.

03:06.740 --> 03:16.360
This is Linux Unplugged episode 146 for May 24, 2016.

03:16.360 --> 03:28.440
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's skipping pebbles into

03:28.440 --> 03:31.680
the body of water that is our Mumble Room.

03:31.680 --> 03:32.680
My name is Chris.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.680
My name is Wes.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.680
Was that profound, Wes?

03:34.680 --> 03:38.040
I'm not going to pretend that made sense, but let's just keep going.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.200
The body of water.

03:39.200 --> 03:43.600
I also liked Rekai's fighting the Windows 10 upgrade menace.

03:43.600 --> 03:44.600
Oh, much better.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.840
Yeah, stay tuned for the Poe Show for more on that.

03:47.840 --> 03:51.400
Coming up on today's episode of the Unplugged program, we are going to talk a little bit

03:51.400 --> 03:54.360
about funding open source projects, but in a new light, in something we've never really

03:54.360 --> 03:59.760
done before, in projects that have a bit of a name and a bit of a reputation, good and

03:59.760 --> 04:00.760
bad.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.880
We're going to start with the Mycroft project today, which is delivering some actual software,

04:04.880 --> 04:08.920
which we have loaded there and HamRadio has been trying out, but we're also going to talk

04:08.920 --> 04:11.600
about Purism.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.520
They have a new initiative, a new piece of hardware.

04:13.520 --> 04:18.160
They claim it is the Microsoft Surface for those of you who respect your privacy and

04:18.160 --> 04:19.160
freedom.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.160
Big promises.

04:20.160 --> 04:25.320
But can we rely on Purism to deliver a product like this when you could argue they haven't

04:25.320 --> 04:28.560
even mastered the last product they launched?

04:28.560 --> 04:32.560
As you can imagine, I have thoughts on this topic, so we'll be discussing that coming

04:32.560 --> 04:33.560
up in the show.

04:33.560 --> 04:39.520
But before all of that, Wes, before all of that, we have some great open source project

04:39.520 --> 04:40.520
updates.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.520
How did you get all these links this week?

04:41.520 --> 04:42.960
Like, this was a Wes blowout.

04:42.960 --> 04:43.960
They've just fallen out of the sky.

04:43.960 --> 04:44.960
You were blowing it out, this.

04:44.960 --> 04:45.960
You were just blowing it out, Wes.

04:45.960 --> 04:46.960
Just blowing it out.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.800
Speaking of blowing it out, you were blowing it out with the beer, too.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.420
Well, hopefully you won't be blowing it out.

04:51.420 --> 04:52.840
It's a delicious beer, and I...

04:52.840 --> 04:54.520
We have to restrain ourselves, Chris.

04:54.520 --> 04:58.920
Once again, you have managed to bring a beer into the Unplugged program.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.640
This is from a local brewery that I've never heard of.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.200
Sneaking it in under your radar.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.480
Copper Donkey.

05:03.480 --> 05:06.160
Copper Donkey from the No Lee, I think is how you say it.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.160
No Lie?

05:07.160 --> 05:08.160
Probably, probably.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.160
It's L-I.

05:09.160 --> 05:10.160
L-I.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.160
I don't know.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.600
It is... Oh, it's a good beer, though.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.600
It's kind of new.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.920
It's from a new brewery they launched just a year ago.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.360
And it is also fairly strong at 8%.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.000
They're doing a good job already.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.120
So Wes brought us a couple of pints.

05:22.120 --> 05:26.760
So we'll be drinking that on today's program, drinking along with you, water, beer, whatever

05:26.760 --> 05:28.160
your beverage of choice is.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.160
Let's bring in that Mamba Room.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.160
Time of property greetings, Mamba Room.

05:30.160 --> 05:31.160
Greetings, users.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.160
Greetings.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.160
I've never installed Gnome slash Linux.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.160
Hi, hi.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.160
Wow.

05:35.160 --> 05:39.920
That is a huge turn in.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.920
I think I even heard some Richard Stallman in there.

05:41.920 --> 05:42.920
That is unbelievable.

05:42.920 --> 05:43.920
Oh, you guys.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.360
Oh, jeez, Louise.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.800
Okay, so I want to talk about this one just really quick.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.960
Well, there's a plane flying overhead right now.

05:50.960 --> 05:51.960
Wes, do you hear that?

05:51.960 --> 05:52.960
I do.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.280
Our friends from the south, Mr. Bowen.

05:55.280 --> 06:00.040
So maybe it's somebody from this new project to come here to talk to us in person because

06:00.040 --> 06:01.080
it could be a big deal.

06:01.080 --> 06:05.980
You may have heard it before, formerly known, the artist formerly known as XDG App is now

06:05.980 --> 06:12.960
Flapjack with a brand new fancy website at Flap or Flat Pack, not Flapjack.

06:12.960 --> 06:18.240
Although I got to imagine, if you think about it, Flapjack is a good metaphor here.

06:18.240 --> 06:23.160
Yeah, I picture stacking individual delicious pancakes on top of each other that don't necessarily

06:23.160 --> 06:27.780
connect until I take my delicious butter and syrup and I mash my fork down in between them

06:27.780 --> 06:31.680
and then bring them all together with my fork stab and put them in my mouth, hence installing

06:31.680 --> 06:32.680
software.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.480
This is why Chris is not a software architect.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.600
No, but they should just talk to me first because I think if they would talk to me-

06:37.600 --> 06:38.600
That's a great breakfast bar though.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.560
Because, you know, they're going for those Ikea easy to pack things, but I'm telling

06:41.560 --> 06:44.360
you a pancakes might just play a little better.

06:44.360 --> 06:49.120
Anyways, Flat Pack is the future of application distribution, according to them.

06:49.120 --> 06:52.880
The days of chasing multiple Linux distributions are over.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.960
You hear that playing with?

06:54.960 --> 06:58.840
Standalone apps for Linux are here, self-contained and future proof.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.080
Distributing applications on Linux is a pain.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.080
Different distributions-

07:02.080 --> 07:03.360
Don't we know it.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.760
Different distros, multiple versions, each with their own versions of libraries, but

07:06.760 --> 07:08.800
Flat Pack is here to change all of that.

07:08.800 --> 07:15.160
It's cross-platform, it's stable, and it's secure.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.680
So you've, you know, another thing you've heard of in another way.

07:17.680 --> 07:22.220
So XEG apps, you've also probably heard this referred to a sandbox apps to make it possible

07:22.220 --> 07:24.480
for third parties to distribute applications.

07:24.480 --> 07:29.560
We talked with someone from the known project in Linux action show about this in our Linux

07:29.560 --> 07:32.480
Fest Northwest coverage.

07:32.480 --> 07:36.520
I don't know Wes, they have a demo here.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.360
I think they're really close to shipping it.

07:38.360 --> 07:42.920
It almost feels like it's now in that spot where is anybody going to ever adopt this?

07:42.920 --> 07:44.120
That's what's going to matter here.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.120
We have that.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.120
We have a app image.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.200
Mumble of many thoughts on anyone ever adopting this.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.540
Will it actually take off?

07:51.540 --> 07:56.340
Will upstream packages embrace this?

07:56.340 --> 07:58.440
I think no, we're going to embrace it quite heavily.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.080
I mean, they're the ones really pushing this.

08:00.080 --> 08:06.440
It's their runtime that's doing all the flat pack stuff right now.

08:06.440 --> 08:10.440
The sticking point for me is still the inefficiency of it.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.760
Like I don't want to have 20 copies of the known runtime for my 20 different flat pack

08:13.760 --> 08:14.760
apps.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.760
Yeah.

08:15.760 --> 08:20.800
Do you see a way around that though and trying to accomplish what they're accomplishing?

08:20.800 --> 08:26.160
I don't, but I think the use case of where they're trying to accomplish it, you know,

08:26.160 --> 08:30.040
it might be a case of just needing that niche of, it's the same niche that's kind of taken

08:30.040 --> 08:31.160
out by rolling releases.

08:31.160 --> 08:35.100
So if I kind of think with my tumbleweed hat, it's like, yeah, I don't care.

08:35.100 --> 08:40.080
If I think with my leap hat on though, yeah, I can see us bundling up flat pack apps and

08:40.080 --> 08:45.000
pushing out shiny and new versions of known maps when previously that would be like a

08:45.000 --> 08:47.120
complete and utter no no.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.120
Yeah.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.480
They have right now on their page, they have nightly builds of GIMP, Inkscape, Darktable,

08:51.480 --> 08:58.180
MyPaint and Scribulous, and they're working on stable builds of the known core applications.

08:58.180 --> 09:01.520
The other thing we have to keep in mind is at the same time this is happening, Canonical

09:01.520 --> 09:08.240
has their own solution, which is snap packages, which is sort of a similar solution for their

09:08.240 --> 09:11.160
specific platform.

09:11.160 --> 09:17.560
And I wonder if that's going to be sort of a duplication of effort on some levels.

09:17.560 --> 09:23.280
For example, if the Gnome desktop could be bundled up as a snap package, then what about

09:23.280 --> 09:26.720
also bundling up as a flat pack?

09:26.720 --> 09:28.840
Is who's going to do that work?

09:28.840 --> 09:33.520
I think flat pack has way more going for it because they're trying to be cross distro

09:33.520 --> 09:37.600
because they're working with all these other other projects, other distros that then, you

09:37.600 --> 09:38.600
know, it's known.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.280
They don't just think about themselves.

09:41.280 --> 09:45.960
Whereas Ubuntu is going to work fine on Ubuntu, but is it going to work anywhere else?

09:45.960 --> 09:52.080
But I think if you I see I would tend to agree with you, except if you look at the way history

09:52.080 --> 09:57.040
has played out when it comes to just packaging up installation packages for distributions,

09:57.040 --> 10:02.880
you see very much very much like in terms of people will go out of their way to package

10:02.880 --> 10:05.560
up for Ubuntu and in a lot of cases, just Ubuntu.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.320
Yeah, that's true.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.040
And that feels like the same thing.

10:09.040 --> 10:14.360
Maybe they're just going to focus on snap packages instead of flat packs.

10:14.360 --> 10:19.640
I look at you know, I look at there's there's projects out there that we are all familiar

10:19.640 --> 10:25.640
with that will soon be repackaged individual components in the entire desktop as snap packages.

10:25.640 --> 10:28.600
They're working on it right now.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.720
And I don't think they're working on flat packs.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.080
That's the thing is the projects I'm thinking of, I already know are working on snap versions,

10:34.080 --> 10:36.120
and I don't know they're working on anything else.

10:36.120 --> 10:42.120
But doesn't that kind of like erode the whole cross distro, you know, appeal?

10:42.120 --> 10:49.720
I mean, the appeal of a flat pack is you do it once and it will work on every distro plus

10:49.720 --> 10:50.720
Ubuntu.

10:50.720 --> 10:51.720
Yeah, I agree.

10:51.720 --> 10:57.280
I mean, if you apply it so much to snap packet packages right now, the only people interested

10:57.280 --> 10:59.040
in snap packages are Ubuntu.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.560
It's like you might as well just do it Ubuntu dev.

11:01.560 --> 11:02.880
I completely agree.

11:02.880 --> 11:07.680
I just I worry that the problem is the people that are making these decisions are idiots

11:07.680 --> 11:08.680
or something.

11:08.680 --> 11:09.680
I don't know why.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.360
I mean, today, I couldn't tell you why so many of them only package for Ubuntu.

11:12.360 --> 11:15.800
I mean, I could it's market share related, but that might just be what pushes them to

11:15.800 --> 11:16.800
use snap packages.

11:16.800 --> 11:17.800
I don't know.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.960
It's probably you're right.

11:19.960 --> 11:23.640
Because flat pack includes Ubuntu, you hope that gives it the nudge ahead.

11:23.640 --> 11:27.920
That just means people will and if they can get behind the mind, if they can get mind

11:27.920 --> 11:28.920
share out there.

11:28.920 --> 11:32.320
And the other issue is Canonical has some momentum behind mind share already.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.480
And they just the ability to promote a little bit better as a company that has resources

11:35.480 --> 11:37.800
to do so and avenues to do so.

11:37.800 --> 11:41.640
And if they can have a good, you know, they can be like, hey, look, have the shiny apps

11:41.640 --> 11:45.160
user base that's already going to install 1604, then they might have a good in road

11:45.160 --> 11:47.560
to actually get people using it.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.360
You can get you can try that right now, though.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.360
It's out there.

11:50.360 --> 11:57.400
So I really want to talk about today just so that we sort of have flat pack now on our

11:57.400 --> 11:58.400
radar instead of XD.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.800
I guess it'll probably depend to like how easy is it to create one or the other?

12:02.800 --> 12:03.800
Yeah.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.640
How well will they integrate into different build tools or build change that people are

12:06.640 --> 12:07.640
already using?

12:07.640 --> 12:08.640
I'm listening to that right now.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.080
It might be worth playing with.

12:10.080 --> 12:14.480
You'd be like, hey, Mike, just target this and go.

12:14.480 --> 12:18.760
I actually like the idea of flat pack and snaps just because I don't have to worry about,

12:18.760 --> 12:24.800
you know, whenever I update my system or right now that I'm on 1510 and like 20 apps that

12:24.800 --> 12:27.880
I want to try, I can't even get yet.

12:27.880 --> 12:28.880
I agree.

12:28.880 --> 12:32.320
I think it makes the I think it makes long term support and enterprise distros way more

12:32.320 --> 12:35.560
viable to if you can get more modern applications and have a nice stable base.

12:35.560 --> 12:36.960
I think that's going to be really sweet.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.400
What do you what do you think, Wes?

12:38.400 --> 12:40.800
So the chat room is asking, why not?

12:40.800 --> 12:41.800
Why not app image?

12:41.800 --> 12:44.480
Why are we why are we not just app image is already a thing.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.920
There's already project shipping with app images.

12:46.920 --> 12:50.000
Why don't we just use an app image, Wes?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.280
It seems like it's going to be the same thing.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.960
It's going to come back to adoption.

12:52.960 --> 12:56.120
And there are a few people like subsurface obviously thinks it's great.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.040
And I don't know, I haven't made an app.

12:58.040 --> 13:02.600
So I guess it would come back to like, how easy is it to integrate into existing build

13:02.600 --> 13:03.600
systems?

13:03.600 --> 13:07.400
How, how hard is it to just go from packaging for distros already and having it ship in

13:07.400 --> 13:08.400
one of these packages?

13:08.400 --> 13:11.480
You know, if Ubuntu provides a really good thing where hey, you're making a dab already,

13:11.480 --> 13:15.600
bam, now you have your snap package, then that would be really nice if it's harder to

13:15.600 --> 13:18.120
make a flat pack or an app image.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.080
App image seems like it's pretty simple.

13:20.080 --> 13:23.760
I haven't looked too much into, you know, here installing a runtime, etc.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.320
But I'd be interested to see a comparison.

13:26.320 --> 13:29.720
They have their own build kit and to it's not it's not bad at all.

13:29.720 --> 13:33.760
And app image is really interesting, because when you first run it, you have to give you

13:33.760 --> 13:35.560
have to manually give it permission to execute.

13:35.560 --> 13:39.340
But once you launch it, it asks, do you want to put it in your your menus, right, like

13:39.340 --> 13:40.340
automatically does that.

13:40.340 --> 13:41.800
So that's pretty cool.

13:41.800 --> 13:46.760
And maybe it's the excuse that or that the complaint that everyone goes against canonical

13:46.760 --> 13:49.320
is like, not developed here.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.440
Maybe gnome is doing the exact same thing.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.280
And for some reason, people aren't mentioning that.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.800
Yeah, and it's a shame we don't have something like the like what we're they're working on,

13:56.800 --> 14:00.760
like on container standards, you know, some sort of here, we're gonna have static static

14:00.760 --> 14:04.480
images keeping contained at all, actually, well, I will just in the same way of having

14:04.480 --> 14:08.120
some sort of standard for if we're gonna do if we're gonna have less, you know, dynamic

14:08.120 --> 14:12.280
linking, etc, in our in future ways that we're shipping software be cool, if we had some

14:12.280 --> 14:16.040
sort of underlying target so that we could have, here's a snap, we can convert it to

14:16.040 --> 14:17.040
a flight.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.040
Right?

14:18.040 --> 14:19.040
Yeah, for sure.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.040
Like, yeah, absolutely.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.840
I think, I think it's two things.

14:21.840 --> 14:25.600
I think it's two things to answer the core question, why not app image right now, I think

14:25.600 --> 14:29.800
the first thing is, is that the gnome guys have been and gals have been working on this

14:29.800 --> 14:35.320
for years, I if you if you recall back, I covered this story as gnome OS, and it's in

14:35.320 --> 14:38.480
a sense, years ago, like they've been working on different iterations of this crazy idea

14:38.480 --> 14:40.360
of applications that can move around.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.840
And it's only really once they kind of let it die off.

14:42.840 --> 14:46.760
And it was only really once since containers and sandboxing and all these kinds of different

14:46.760 --> 14:51.040
things like Wayland and namespaces all started to become available options that we could

14:51.040 --> 14:53.720
actually ship one day, they got serious about it again.

14:53.720 --> 14:57.840
And a core component of it for them, this, I believe, is the second part is sandboxing.

14:57.840 --> 15:01.600
They believe sandboxing fundamentally, and I've linked it in their wiki why they believe

15:01.600 --> 15:02.600
this.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.400
And they don't they don't want to use sandboxing for the reasons that like you traditionally

15:06.400 --> 15:10.840
think of like, prevent you from getting access to things on your system, it is legitimately

15:10.840 --> 15:15.680
to isolate the application to move it around and to protect the overall system.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.920
And that's a core functionality for them.

15:17.920 --> 15:21.040
And they see it not just core to security, but core to how these things are portable

15:21.040 --> 15:23.680
to begin with.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.280
And I think app image is a great solution.

15:25.280 --> 15:28.320
I personally am I'm happy to download an app image thing.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.760
I just really have it really hasn't been an issue for me.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.760
Yeah, exactly.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.320
App Images has actually been around for a while too, because they were originally the

15:35.320 --> 15:36.320
portable apps.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.320
Mm hmm.

15:37.320 --> 15:38.320
That's true.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.200
And it's really it's a really cool idea.

15:40.200 --> 15:44.920
But as far as like, the containerization in the sandboxing, they don't really have any

15:44.920 --> 15:45.920
of that.

15:45.920 --> 15:52.240
So so I guess in a way, they're kind of improving the concept with the Flatpak, and also Flatpak

15:52.240 --> 15:53.240
is a cooler name.

15:53.240 --> 15:54.240
Yeah, way better.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.920
Yeah, they're doing a better job with the branding.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.760
So hopefully that will help, you know, people ship.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.960
And I think the other thing that just maybe just to finish up the mindshare thing is I

16:00.960 --> 16:04.440
think this is another example of mindshare, where mindshare makes a difference in app

16:04.440 --> 16:07.440
image has gotten traction among some of us, but it just really hasn't gotten the mindshare.

16:07.440 --> 16:11.560
And part of that is, and this is the part we just have a hard time connecting the dots

16:11.560 --> 16:16.640
with is there are people from the known project that are going out to technology conferences

16:16.640 --> 16:22.040
like Linux plumbers conference and, and, and then in the Gwadek and Fedora's and all the

16:22.040 --> 16:26.400
different conferences, and they are they are promoting this idea, they're talking about

16:26.400 --> 16:30.920
this idea, they're engaging with people about this idea in a way that is probably at a higher

16:30.920 --> 16:32.240
intensity than the app image project.

16:32.240 --> 16:35.780
Well, it kind of makes it feel like if you're targeting our platform, here's our solution

16:35.780 --> 16:38.520
for this rather app image feels a little bit like you're an independent developer with

16:38.520 --> 16:39.600
a one off app.

16:39.600 --> 16:40.600
Here you go.

16:40.600 --> 16:44.080
You can package it up with totally, totally nailed that I think that and that's a big

16:44.080 --> 16:45.080
way about me.

16:45.080 --> 16:48.160
That's a big, you have to remember that's how the known project thing, right?

16:48.160 --> 16:49.880
That's a and that's a big part of it.

16:49.880 --> 16:55.260
Also, I would say last but not least, I think it just underscores how important the in person

16:55.260 --> 17:00.840
application and meetings and discussions are to really move some of these important technologies

17:00.840 --> 17:01.840
real.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.640
Yeah, to move them through an open source community where everybody kind of has to sign

17:04.640 --> 17:07.680
off and implement and all the different fiefdoms.

17:07.680 --> 17:11.280
And the and that's something I think that the known projects just better at.

17:11.280 --> 17:18.040
Speaking of that exact thing, system D, system D has a big update version two, three, oh,

17:18.040 --> 17:20.760
when's the last time we even mentioned system D on this show.

17:20.760 --> 17:23.800
And the reason why we're in a while, yeah, we're bringing it up because let's not kid

17:23.800 --> 17:29.200
ourselves in terms of how long these things have been around, still kind of an early

17:29.200 --> 17:30.200
project.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.200
And this is a big update.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.520
A lot of things are changing, right?

17:33.520 --> 17:36.040
And it's one of those that they recommend themselves.

17:36.040 --> 17:39.320
The project recommends that even the more aggressive distributions keep this one in

17:39.320 --> 17:40.520
testing for extra longer.

17:40.520 --> 17:41.520
Did you see that in there?

17:41.520 --> 17:42.520
I did see that.

17:42.520 --> 17:43.520
Yeah.

17:43.520 --> 17:48.240
So there's a bunch of stuff like DNSSEC being turned on by default, etc, etc, etc.

17:48.240 --> 17:51.400
But I wanted to jump right down to the one you're the most excited about.

17:51.400 --> 17:55.560
This because it's, I get it on some level, but I think you have a bigger reason why you

17:55.560 --> 17:56.560
like it.

17:56.560 --> 18:00.760
And essentially what it is is the system D networking stuff will now allow a unique identifier

18:00.760 --> 18:04.280
to be sent in a DHCP request.

18:04.280 --> 18:08.120
And you can configure for each system in the.network file managed by system D networking

18:08.120 --> 18:13.720
or network D. And they'll have different like DUIDs and DUID raw data and IAID options.

18:13.720 --> 18:18.840
And I would guess this would be, well, I'm guessing so that when you're spinning up a

18:18.840 --> 18:21.640
bunch of machines, you know what machine it is somehow.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.400
I mean, why not just use MAC addresses, etc.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.840
Well, it's mostly that.

18:25.840 --> 18:32.280
So you do have control over the MAC address, but with IPv6, and like if you're using DHCPv6,

18:32.280 --> 18:35.200
you can no longer for a lot of systems use a MAC address.

18:35.200 --> 18:39.760
They use something, the DUID device unique identifier or something like that, which is

18:39.760 --> 18:45.180
a longer string of hex characters in a similar fashion, like any kind of DUID.

18:45.180 --> 18:47.520
But that is sent to identify a device.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.080
So this adds support.

18:49.080 --> 18:52.320
I've enjoyed system D network D. It's not going to do everything, but for servers or

18:52.320 --> 18:57.120
especially containers where you probably already have system D, and you can make like a two

18:57.120 --> 18:59.680
line file to enable DHCP on all your interfaces.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.960
So when you're spinning up a new container, bam, you have addresses.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.720
And then this just lets you add, which I've been looking forward to do for when I want

19:06.720 --> 19:09.920
to, you know, I have some containers where I just like, they're going to be ephemeral.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.780
I just want them to spin up, get an address, do something and disappear.

19:12.780 --> 19:15.720
Some like I'm going to have more permanent and maybe they need static IP addresses or

19:15.720 --> 19:18.000
I'm going to have them in DNS or something like that.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.040
So this will let you easily just add a line where you can change that identifier and you

19:22.040 --> 19:25.920
can change like interspace specific or for the whole system and you can change the DHCP.

19:25.920 --> 19:29.880
You can change it to have send a unique identifier instead of the MAC address.

19:29.880 --> 19:30.880
So it'll just make it a lot easier.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.920
And then your, you know, your DHCP server will just pick them right up, give them the

19:33.920 --> 19:35.320
address that they want.

19:35.320 --> 19:38.120
Also a bunch of stuff change your system D login D in this release too.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.320
So that user, the user stuff is pretty big.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.320
Yeah.

19:41.320 --> 19:42.320
What is it?

19:42.320 --> 19:43.320
And from my understanding...

19:43.320 --> 19:48.120
So that's where when you, when your user session is over, now all of your programs will be

19:48.120 --> 19:49.120
terminated.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.120
Right.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.440
If you have a team X running, it will be terminated.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.140
So that's one of the big changes that they're stressing here that people will be looking

19:55.140 --> 19:56.280
out for.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.280
That was it.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.280
Yeah.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.280
And, yeah.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.400
And I think in some regards it will, there'll be a point in time where we just think that's

20:02.400 --> 20:05.360
obvious that it should be the default behavior, but it's a big transition.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.560
It is a huge transition now.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.960
And it, and it, you know, it just kind of makes sense.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.440
It does fit if you, if you adopt what they suggest and you, you know, use it system D

20:12.440 --> 20:17.400
run to run it in the right scope and is in the right user scope and everything, then,

20:17.400 --> 20:20.800
then yeah, you can account for it well and you can control its resources, et cetera.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.680
And probably you'll have, you know, there'll be a lot of stuff where you're going to set

20:23.680 --> 20:25.640
up like a user level service for it anyway.

20:25.640 --> 20:26.640
So it won't matter.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.640
Yeah.

20:27.640 --> 20:31.360
And that was, that is definitely the, that's going to just definitely make sure you do

20:31.360 --> 20:33.920
set that up that way, which is just best practice anyways.

20:33.920 --> 20:34.920
Right.

20:34.920 --> 20:37.280
There are, I have seen way too many people where you're like, Oh, I'm just gonna, yeah,

20:37.280 --> 20:38.280
it works.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.280
I tested it out.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.280
I run it into my session.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.280
It works.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.120
You don't have to really demonize it and you're like, yeah, yeah.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.240
So watch out for that one.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.040
And we have a link in the show notes with more info.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.040
Anything else to about at you?

20:47.040 --> 20:48.040
Yeah.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.040
I mean, there's a lot of, there's a lot of interesting stuff.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.440
It depends on how you feel about system D, but they keep plugging along.

20:51.440 --> 20:52.440
Yeah, they do.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.840
So the, the full release notes are in there.

20:54.840 --> 20:55.840
All right.

20:55.840 --> 20:56.840
Then watch yourself.

20:56.840 --> 21:01.400
We got a little valve update kind of sort of not directly, not directly.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.320
It's just a, let's see, where's my, here it is.

21:03.320 --> 21:04.320
Oh yeah.

21:04.320 --> 21:06.320
Oh, I got it right here.

21:06.320 --> 21:11.200
My my steam controller, I bought the steam controller thinking this is going to become

21:11.200 --> 21:13.600
the defacto Linux controller.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.600
This is the one you're going to use.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.600
You're going to try to erase the sun.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.600
That's what you'll be using.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.600
Yeah.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.600
No more Xbox 360.

21:18.600 --> 21:19.600
It's going to be this guy.

21:19.600 --> 21:20.600
And I think.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.600
No go?

21:21.600 --> 21:22.600
No.

21:22.600 --> 21:26.440
Well, um, the big problem was, is it's been so directly attached to steam.

21:26.440 --> 21:27.440
Right.

21:27.440 --> 21:31.160
That I just, the extra hassle of having to open up, even if I want to just play a game

21:31.160 --> 21:34.440
I installed from a repo, having to open up steam and configure and all that kind of stuff.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.140
It was a real bummer for me.

21:36.140 --> 21:38.720
So I want to introduce you to SC controller.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.440
Man, I love open source.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.440
Look at this thing.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.440
It's a GTK.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.440
Well done.

21:43.440 --> 21:49.000
Yeah, it's a GTK UI for configuring your steam controller, setting up all the buttons, what

21:49.000 --> 21:50.760
they do, mapping all of the different stuff.

21:50.760 --> 21:55.960
It allows you to configure it completely without ever launching steam profiles.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.200
You can switch between games.

21:57.200 --> 22:01.440
It's got stick pads and gyroscope input, haptic feedback support, macros, rapid fire mode

22:01.440 --> 22:02.440
shift.

22:02.440 --> 22:07.260
And you can also enable emulation for the Xbox 360 for a mouse pad and balls and keyboards

22:07.260 --> 22:08.260
and all that.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.260
Yeah.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.480
So maybe some, maybe next week we'll have to give that a go.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.480
Maybe, maybe.

22:12.480 --> 22:13.480
Yeah.

22:13.480 --> 22:16.680
Cause it was just pretty, pretty, just a post over at gaming on linux.com and I'm really

22:16.680 --> 22:17.680
impressed by this.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.120
When was the last time you played with that bad boy?

22:20.120 --> 22:21.120
Hmm.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.880
Well at least two machines ago.

22:22.880 --> 22:23.880
Right.

22:23.880 --> 22:24.880
Yeah.

22:24.880 --> 22:25.880
Cause I've had some machines in and out here.

22:25.880 --> 22:26.880
Cause we've been moving hardware around.

22:26.880 --> 22:27.880
Yeah.

22:27.880 --> 22:28.880
So there you go.

22:28.880 --> 22:29.880
I think that's really neat.

22:29.880 --> 22:30.880
And it's posted up on GitHub.

22:30.880 --> 22:31.880
We have a link in the show notes.

22:31.880 --> 22:32.880
Yeah.

22:32.880 --> 22:33.880
That's interesting.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.780
That's a good, Liam says at the bottom of his post that a valve should really hire this

22:36.780 --> 22:39.600
guy to speed up uncoupling the steam controller from big picture.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.600
Yeah.

22:40.600 --> 22:41.600
Yeah.

22:41.600 --> 22:42.600
There you go.

22:42.600 --> 22:43.600
Yeah.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.600
Have you tried it?

22:44.600 --> 22:45.600
Do you want to, have you, have you want to, you want to manhandle it there?

22:45.600 --> 22:46.600
You want to?

22:46.600 --> 22:47.600
Ooh.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.600
Yeah.

22:48.600 --> 22:49.600
That's nice, right?

22:49.600 --> 22:50.600
It is smooth.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.600
That's nice.

22:51.600 --> 22:52.600
That's nice.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.600
Okay.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.600
So just a super quick little heads up for you out there that are on Fedora and want

22:54.600 --> 22:55.600
GUIs for all the things.

22:55.600 --> 23:00.840
Yum extender is a GUI for managing, you guessed it, yum and DNF.

23:00.840 --> 23:01.840
Really DNF.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.080
Now it's a front end graphical interface for DNF.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.080
You can check it out.

23:05.080 --> 23:09.760
I think in the show notes called yum extender and yum extender powered by DNF.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.720
Man, between that and that system D.

23:11.720 --> 23:12.720
I know.

23:12.720 --> 23:13.720
What can't you manage?

23:13.720 --> 23:14.720
That's right.

23:14.720 --> 23:15.720
That was the thing.

23:15.720 --> 23:16.720
That system D manager works pretty well.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.720
Looks pretty sweet.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.720
Yeah.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.720
We talked about that in this week's Linux action show if you guys haven't seen that.

23:21.720 --> 23:22.720
Okay.

23:22.720 --> 23:25.720
So before we jump any further, we have a lot still to cover in the updates.

23:25.720 --> 23:26.720
We probably need to pick up the pace.

23:26.720 --> 23:29.140
We probably need to shake, shake it off like Mariah Carey.

23:29.140 --> 23:32.960
So first let's talk about Ting because we got to get legit here for a second.

23:32.960 --> 23:33.960
We got to get real.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.200
We got to get real mobile that makes sense.

23:35.200 --> 23:39.840
No more messing around with stupid guesses on how many minutes you might use or megabytes

23:39.840 --> 23:40.840
or messages.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.440
It's just pay for what you use over at Ting.

23:42.440 --> 23:46.760
They got no contracts, no other termination fee, six dollar dollars.

23:46.760 --> 23:47.760
That's it.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.200
Six dollars is all you pay for the line.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.080
Girl, are you hearing that?

23:51.080 --> 23:52.080
Whoa.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.080
Six dollars.

23:53.080 --> 23:56.600
Plus you got the Uncle Sam taxes because Uncle Sam loves his cut.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.600
Got to pay for that.

23:57.600 --> 23:58.600
It's such a good deal he needs something.

23:58.600 --> 24:01.300
Got to pay for all them important federal programs somehow.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.880
So Ting's got to pay the pet taxes.

24:02.880 --> 24:07.080
So all right, so it's six dollars taxes and then just what you use.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.080
You on Wi-Fi?

24:08.080 --> 24:09.080
You're not paying for nothing.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.920
You want to get updates from your Android phone?

24:12.920 --> 24:13.920
Ting don't care.

24:13.920 --> 24:14.960
Ting is honey badger.

24:14.960 --> 24:15.960
They don't care.

24:15.960 --> 24:16.960
They don't care.

24:16.960 --> 24:17.960
Why would they?

24:17.960 --> 24:18.960
They don't care.

24:18.960 --> 24:19.960
You can get updates.

24:19.960 --> 24:20.960
Go to right now.

24:20.960 --> 24:21.960
You ready?

24:21.960 --> 24:22.960
Linux.ting.com.

24:22.960 --> 24:23.960
Linux.ting.com.

24:23.960 --> 24:24.960
That's where you go.

24:24.960 --> 24:30.840
You get yourself a little savings like 25 bones.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.800
You support this show.

24:32.800 --> 24:37.920
If you got a compatible device and you just might because they got CDMA and GSM, you get

24:37.920 --> 24:39.960
credit on your account.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.200
I'm not playing.

24:41.200 --> 24:42.200
You get credit.

24:42.200 --> 24:45.920
It's probably going to pay for more than your first month because that's how freaking inexpensive

24:45.920 --> 24:46.920
Ting is.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.560
All right, so you get the credit on the account.

24:48.560 --> 24:53.040
Then you're so happy with it, you go do a little evangelizing.

24:53.040 --> 24:55.720
Now I'm not telling you not to send people to linux.ting.com because that would seriously

24:55.720 --> 24:57.120
help out our show if you spread that around.

24:57.120 --> 25:02.080
But I'm just saying if you're a Ting customer, they got a referral program.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.640
They got a referral program.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.200
A referral program.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.200
They got a referral program.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.040
What kind of program is that?

25:08.040 --> 25:09.040
It's a referral program.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.040
And if you get people to switch over to Ting, you get a little something something.

25:12.040 --> 25:15.760
And the reason why I don't want to say too much is because I think it's a better deal

25:15.760 --> 25:16.760
than I can get you.

25:16.760 --> 25:18.560
But just get started by going to linux.ting.com.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.560
Just go right there.

25:19.560 --> 25:20.560
Check out your prices.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.560
They got early termination relief programs.

25:21.560 --> 25:24.600
If you got stuck on one of them duopoly contracts like a sucker.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.600
Never again.

25:25.600 --> 25:26.600
I was there.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.600
I was there.

25:27.600 --> 25:28.600
I feel you.

25:28.600 --> 25:29.600
I was there.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.600
I'm not there again.

25:30.600 --> 25:31.600
No, no.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.920
I don't go to Ting, Linux.ting.com.

25:33.920 --> 25:35.100
It's different.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.560
Ting keeps rates simple.

25:36.560 --> 25:38.120
We don't make you pick a plan.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.140
Instead, you just use your phone as you normally would.

25:40.140 --> 25:43.140
How much you use determines how much you pay each month.

25:43.140 --> 25:46.520
You can have as many devices as you want on one account.

25:46.520 --> 25:50.800
That's good because when you use more, you pay less per minute, message or megabyte of

25:50.800 --> 25:51.800
data.

25:51.800 --> 25:56.760
Your usage plus $6 per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill.

25:56.760 --> 25:57.760
Simple.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.300
That's what we mean when we say...

25:59.300 --> 26:00.300
Alright!

26:00.300 --> 26:01.300
...mobile.

26:01.300 --> 26:02.300
That makes sense.

26:02.300 --> 26:03.300
I like this one too.

26:03.300 --> 26:08.800
They got a good post up there by Luke about data caps, and about what an SOB they are

26:08.800 --> 26:09.800
when you're trying to cut the cord.

26:09.800 --> 26:10.800
They got a great blog too.

26:10.800 --> 26:11.800
You can go read it.

26:11.800 --> 26:17.840
Just start by going to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com, and thanks for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.240
Alright, roll up your sleeves.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.240
Whoa!

26:21.240 --> 26:23.840
LibreOffice is getting to work in the Italian Army.

26:23.840 --> 26:28.040
Following the announcement made last year, the Italian Army has moved forward with its

26:28.040 --> 26:30.720
plans to replace Microsoft Office with LibreOffice.

26:30.720 --> 26:36.000
So far, the Army has tested its plan across 5,000 workstations.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.000
Wow!

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
That's a pretty big roll up.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Without any major problems too.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Yeah.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Yeah.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Now, they have those...

26:42.000 --> 26:45.640
This is just the beginning, Wes, because once they get through this test program, this is

26:45.640 --> 26:46.640
the part I really like.

26:46.640 --> 26:49.880
I'm like, okay, yeah, that's great, you know, they're aiming to replace all MS Office by

26:49.880 --> 26:50.880
the end of the year.

26:50.880 --> 26:53.040
Okay, I've heard this story before.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.360
This is the part I like.

26:55.360 --> 26:58.960
The Department of Defense is also working on e-training materials to help new users

26:58.960 --> 27:04.520
adapt to LibreOffice quickly, and once these materials are complete, the department aims

27:04.520 --> 27:07.040
to release them under a copyleft license.

27:07.040 --> 27:10.560
This will be a great contribution to LibreOffice project and will increase the adoption of the

27:10.560 --> 27:14.520
Office suite across Italy.

27:14.520 --> 27:15.520
Now that's a very good point.

27:15.520 --> 27:16.520
Yeah.

27:16.520 --> 27:19.240
I was just reading Visual Basic turned 25.

27:19.240 --> 27:22.760
But VBA, right, the scripting language in so many of their Office projects, that still

27:22.760 --> 27:24.000
exists, but it's not a major...

27:24.000 --> 27:26.720
It's used all the time, but it's not being heavily developed.

27:26.720 --> 27:28.920
There's so many things with open source here.

27:28.920 --> 27:33.240
If the army has some sort of pain point or they need enhancement of a feature, they can

27:33.240 --> 27:35.840
pay developers to do that, and everyone benefits.

27:35.840 --> 27:36.840
That's true.

27:36.840 --> 27:37.840
That's true.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.600
And they don't have to wait for it to be in the interest of the parent company.

27:40.600 --> 27:41.600
Yeah.

27:41.600 --> 27:45.600
And really, why not, if you're going to use the public's money to do something like this,

27:45.600 --> 27:46.600
why not?

27:46.600 --> 27:47.600
Absolutely.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.600
Yeah.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.600
That's a nice thing too, you know?

27:49.600 --> 27:50.600
Okay.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.440
So, Wes, you had a little bit of an arch story.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.640
I secretly use Arch Linux.

27:54.640 --> 28:00.000
And I thought this was kind of perfect, because it's about bringing PPAs to Arch, which, as

28:00.000 --> 28:02.880
Popey is a recent Arch switcher, I'm sure this is going to be great for him.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.880
This will kind of make it all...

28:03.880 --> 28:04.880
Need something like this to, you know...

28:04.880 --> 28:05.880
Yeah, make it familiar for him.

28:05.880 --> 28:06.880
...facilitate his workflow.

28:06.880 --> 28:07.880
Yeah.

28:07.880 --> 28:12.680
So, this is a new tool that would allow you to create basically what they're calling PPAs

28:12.680 --> 28:13.680
for Arch, which is kind of...

28:13.680 --> 28:17.760
I don't know if I like the branding or the title, but the functionality does seem like

28:17.760 --> 28:19.360
something maybe I could use.

28:19.360 --> 28:24.360
Think of the Arch PPA like a do-it-yourself PPA personal package archive in the style

28:24.360 --> 28:26.280
of PPAs.

28:26.280 --> 28:31.320
Think popular Ubuntu's operating system PPAs, but hosted for you on your own terms, either

28:31.320 --> 28:35.200
locally or on a server that you have access to, and they allow you to distribute packages

28:35.200 --> 28:38.600
to hundreds of thousands of possible Arch users.

28:38.600 --> 28:43.320
Arch-PPA developer Ryan McGuire says that he created this utility to help the Arch Linux

28:43.320 --> 28:49.080
personal packaging ecosystem be more secure than it is right now, by making your own

28:49.080 --> 28:53.520
private repo that doesn't get its audits contributed back upstream, and officially recognizing

28:53.520 --> 28:56.520
software repositories where anyone with the proper skills can now upload, they can have

28:56.520 --> 28:58.120
their own repo.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.200
Wow!

28:59.200 --> 29:02.900
This is where Arch-PPA comes in handy for AUR package maintainers who are looking for

29:02.900 --> 29:06.760
an easy way to create a manual repository that they can maintain with the Arch Linux

29:06.760 --> 29:09.320
packages they want to distribute in a secure, safe environment.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.160
I love it for a LAN-like repository.

29:12.160 --> 29:15.920
Yes, exactly, or on your VPN or whatever.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.520
Nothing about that's like a PPA.

29:17.520 --> 29:18.520
No.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.800
It's more like an overlay.

29:20.800 --> 29:24.640
I don't think people are going to suddenly add a bunch of these repositories when there's

29:24.640 --> 29:27.560
already the AUR in place.

29:27.560 --> 29:32.160
I like the Popeye and the Charms, just as we start moving PPAs to SNAPs.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.440
But boy, I wish I had a comedy horn for that.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.440
That's a good point.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.440
That's it.

29:36.440 --> 29:37.440
I will probably set this up and play with it.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.440
Really?

29:38.440 --> 29:39.440
Now, what's the use case?

29:39.440 --> 29:40.440
Seriously.

29:40.440 --> 29:44.800
Well, mostly things just like maybe like the ZFS module, you just build it once there

29:44.800 --> 29:49.320
and then anyone else can jump right in.

29:49.320 --> 29:52.680
I think it's because he hasn't refreshed his machine in a while, so he wants to trust more

29:52.680 --> 29:53.680
weird stuff.

29:53.680 --> 30:00.160
Yeah, I was thinking, that's what I was thinking, ChilledPrimary, I guess, ChilledPrimary says

30:00.160 --> 30:02.400
that it's great for the enterprises.

30:02.400 --> 30:03.400
Yeah, exactly.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.200
You can kind of have, you can build your own, build your own use arch in the enterprise

30:06.200 --> 30:07.200
though.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.480
I mean, some must, I grant.

30:09.480 --> 30:10.480
You are.

30:10.480 --> 30:11.480
That's kind of crazy.

30:11.480 --> 30:12.480
But you could now, I guess.

30:12.480 --> 30:16.160
Well, it doesn't have to even be from the AUR, right?

30:16.160 --> 30:19.120
It's just kind of a way to like, you can make your own package builds for whatever, your

30:19.120 --> 30:23.060
own proprietary software, whatever, and then this will compile it and host a repo for you

30:23.060 --> 30:25.360
so that any other arch machine can be configured.

30:25.360 --> 30:28.840
Maybe you want your own custom kernel that you want to compile on your build host, host

30:28.840 --> 30:29.840
it here.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.240
You know, that seems fine.

30:32.240 --> 30:37.100
What I was thinking is instead of getting it directly from the AUR, before you push

30:37.100 --> 30:40.000
it to users, you check out the script, yeah, it's fine.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.000
Then I push it to users.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.080
You know, you control the rates of how much comes from the AUR, how fast.

30:46.080 --> 30:48.280
Or you then, and then you whack out your latest version of your package.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.960
You run all your build tests, you run all the rest of your tests, and then you push

30:50.960 --> 30:51.960
it to Brad.

30:51.960 --> 30:52.960
Yeah.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.760
And if it does handle some of the dependency logic for you, that is, yeah, that is really

30:54.760 --> 30:55.760
nice.

30:55.760 --> 30:56.760
You're right.

30:56.760 --> 30:57.760
Yeah.

30:57.760 --> 30:58.760
Okay.

30:58.760 --> 30:59.760
All right.

30:59.760 --> 31:00.760
Now I'm starting to see it like for, for, I wish I had more droplets that still used

31:00.760 --> 31:01.760
arch.

31:01.760 --> 31:02.760
I only have one left that uses arch.

31:02.760 --> 31:03.760
I was like, I just have it as a matter of principle now.

31:03.760 --> 31:06.200
You know, I just keep it up because, well.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.200
You have to.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.200
I can.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.200
I can do it every day, brother.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.640
This was a big story out of Google IO.

31:12.640 --> 31:17.440
We really haven't covered Google IO in any of our shows much, except for Coder Radio.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.200
But I thought maybe we could talk a little bit about this one, because I think you found

31:20.200 --> 31:21.720
this link here, Wes.

31:21.720 --> 31:25.480
It gives us a little insight about how they're going to be running Android apps securely

31:25.480 --> 31:32.360
on Chrome OS, and you guessed it, containers.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.980
They're going to be using containers on Chrome OS, yeah.

31:34.980 --> 31:35.980
Not just containers, though.

31:35.980 --> 31:36.980
I'll tell you about it.

31:36.980 --> 31:40.800
So this is looking at a development preview, which is, you're going to have other versions

31:40.800 --> 31:41.800
available in August.

31:41.800 --> 31:42.800
You guys can get your hands on.

31:42.800 --> 31:48.680
But apparently, Chrome OS has taken advantage of containers to get this Android app compatibility.

31:48.680 --> 31:52.240
The full Android framework is implemented in a Linux container that isolates Android

31:52.240 --> 31:56.280
from the rest of Chrome OS and puts its apps in a sandbox.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.880
And here's a little bit of a diagram if you're watching the video version.

31:58.880 --> 32:01.160
Yeah, that was a nice diagram.

32:01.160 --> 32:04.880
A hardware abstraction layer has been built between Android and Chrome OS that runs native

32:04.880 --> 32:09.400
ARM code on Chromebooks using processors with ARM instruction and emulates it on Chromebooks

32:09.400 --> 32:12.240
using Intel processors.

32:12.240 --> 32:17.640
With SE Linux, ah, yes, the secure version of Linux implemented in Android 4.3 back in

32:17.640 --> 32:23.600
2003 on Android and in Chrome OS in 2012, the Android framework runs in a container

32:23.600 --> 32:27.040
that isolates it from other containers and OS modules using Linux functionality called

32:27.040 --> 32:28.680
namespaces.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.840
Android is granted only specific privileges to view and interact with Chrome OS hardware

32:31.840 --> 32:36.940
resources such as keyboards, cameras, communication stuff.

32:36.940 --> 32:40.440
The isolation prevents potentially harmful code within the Android container from interacting

32:40.440 --> 32:43.480
with code outside Android containers.

32:43.480 --> 32:46.880
So containers in SE Linux is how they're going to get Android apps on Chrome OS.

32:46.880 --> 32:50.160
Hopefully that does mean we'll be able to see it ported to other Linuxes at some point.

32:50.160 --> 32:53.160
Yeah, but there's going to be a lot to set up.

32:53.160 --> 32:54.160
Yep.

32:54.160 --> 32:59.280
Yeah, every time this comes up, I think, would I actually use these apps on Linux?

32:59.280 --> 33:03.320
It's also so strange to see, like, using, you know, kernel technology, but in such like

33:03.320 --> 33:10.400
a far removed and heavily packaged and consumer focused, taking some hardcore like server

33:10.400 --> 33:11.400
grade stuff.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.400
Very strange.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.560
I mean, it's cool.

33:13.560 --> 33:14.560
It's neat.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.960
That's, but I guess I would check out the Photoshop app.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.720
If I could try out the Photoshop app, I might try that.

33:20.720 --> 33:21.720
And Evernote, maybe.

33:21.720 --> 33:22.720
Mm hmm.

33:22.720 --> 33:23.720
Yeah.

33:23.720 --> 33:24.720
Evernote, Photoshop.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.720
I don't know.

33:25.720 --> 33:26.720
I mean, there's a few things.

33:26.720 --> 33:27.720
Bubble, UPMPs.

33:27.720 --> 33:28.720
Sling TV.

33:28.720 --> 33:29.720
I would like that too.

33:29.720 --> 33:32.280
I would like that.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.280
So I guess there's a few.

33:33.280 --> 33:34.280
There's a.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.280
Yeah.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.280
OK.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.280
All right.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.280
Maybe Google Play Music.

33:38.280 --> 33:39.280
Maybe.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.280
Oh, yeah, that's true.

33:40.280 --> 33:41.280
Hmm.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.280
Hmm.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.280
Yeah.

33:43.280 --> 33:44.280
Look at that GitHub script there.

33:44.280 --> 33:47.840
Muahaha in the chat room links the DigitalOcean Debian to ArchScript.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.000
That is a thing.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.080
That's also a great script.

33:50.080 --> 33:53.600
If you want to learn a little bit how, like, init RAMFS and pivot root and that kind of

33:53.600 --> 33:55.980
stuff works, I would definitely recommend checking those out because there's some clever

33:55.980 --> 33:57.880
stuff you could do to convert a running system.

33:57.880 --> 34:01.480
Yeah, you convert a running Debian box into an Arch box.

34:01.480 --> 34:02.480
It's just awesome.

34:02.480 --> 34:03.480
It helps now that there's a system involved.

34:03.480 --> 34:06.480
Like, if you ever, like, in a conversation with someone, like, what can Linux do that

34:06.480 --> 34:08.240
Windows can't do, really?

34:08.240 --> 34:09.240
What can, what can?

34:09.240 --> 34:13.160
Like, because I've got video games and I've got Exchange and Outlook.

34:13.160 --> 34:14.160
What can Linux do?

34:14.160 --> 34:16.080
And you're like, well, let me show you this.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.080
Right.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.080
Come here, son.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.080
Sit down.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.080
Let me show you something.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.080
Yeah.

34:21.080 --> 34:22.080
All right.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.560
So anybody in the moment have thoughts about Android apps on Chrome OS?

34:23.560 --> 34:26.920
I don't sense a lot of interest from you guys.

34:26.920 --> 34:27.920
I'm already interested.

34:27.920 --> 34:28.920
Okay.

34:28.920 --> 34:29.920
It's cool.

34:29.920 --> 34:34.800
It's something that I would like for people who already have a Chromebook, because I know

34:34.800 --> 34:39.560
people who have them, even though I kind of didn't want them to get one, they get it anyway.

34:39.560 --> 34:42.640
So it was kind of because they wouldn't, and immediately they started complaining about

34:42.640 --> 34:44.920
not being able to install stuff and things like that.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.120
So we kind of solved their problem.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.480
But really, other than that, I don't care.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.480
All right.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.480
Who else?

34:51.480 --> 34:52.880
I know a couple of people want to speak up.

34:52.880 --> 34:53.880
Go ahead.

34:53.880 --> 34:58.880
Yeah, and the Play Store has a wide variety of apps, which is-

34:58.880 --> 34:59.880
And games.

34:59.880 --> 35:00.880
With them.

35:00.880 --> 35:01.880
Yes.

35:01.880 --> 35:04.760
Which is far better than the Linux desktop that's available right now.

35:04.760 --> 35:10.400
For example, Bacon Reader is the best Reddit client I've ever used, and nothing on Linux

35:10.400 --> 35:11.520
can imagine.

35:11.520 --> 35:12.520
So-

35:12.520 --> 35:16.440
Those are fighting words right there.

35:16.440 --> 35:19.560
But you can't have too many selection of apps.

35:19.560 --> 35:23.160
So adding the Android ones is good.

35:23.160 --> 35:29.720
I mean, they're not going to be- Theoretically, they could become Linux-based with the container

35:29.720 --> 35:30.720
structure.

35:30.720 --> 35:35.120
But right now, they're not even released yet, and it's going to be like a couple months

35:35.120 --> 35:36.480
before it even becomes beta.

35:36.480 --> 35:41.280
So the likelihood of it becoming Linux will be a very long time away.

35:41.280 --> 35:47.280
I'm kind of curious to hear what Richard thinks, just from the perspective of OpenSUSE too.

35:47.280 --> 35:52.320
I hear, well, Android Play Store has a lot of great apps that Linux desktop doesn't have,

35:52.320 --> 35:55.760
and I guess maybe like this little primitive part in the back of my brain goes, uh-oh,

35:55.760 --> 35:56.760
is that a threat?

35:56.760 --> 35:57.760
Is that a threat to Linux?

35:57.760 --> 36:01.360
Is that a- Hold on, are we never going to get to the desktop now if something based

36:01.360 --> 36:04.680
on Linux has these great proprietary Play Store applications?

36:04.680 --> 36:05.680
What do you think, Richard?

36:05.680 --> 36:08.480
Is that not really apples and oranges?

36:08.480 --> 36:09.480
Is it a fair threat?

36:09.480 --> 36:10.480
Your thoughts?

36:10.480 --> 36:16.640
I've seen a few times now of trying to get mobile apps running on the desktop.

36:16.640 --> 36:21.440
I mean, it's- I think I even had it running on one of my machines a while back, like way

36:21.440 --> 36:27.120
in the early Android days when that kind of stuff wasn't too crazy.

36:27.120 --> 36:34.440
It never really appeals because it isn't the right- the wrong form factor, the wrong screen.

36:34.440 --> 36:39.520
It's like the same thing you already have with Android phone apps and Android tablet

36:39.520 --> 36:40.520
apps.

36:40.520 --> 36:43.480
Well, you're going to have, what, Android laptop apps?

36:43.480 --> 36:45.880
Yeah, that is going to be funky, huh?

36:45.880 --> 36:46.880
Yeah.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.880
Embedded West, your thoughts for people that might want this over, say, an iPad, like your

36:49.880 --> 36:51.680
real basic user?

36:51.680 --> 36:58.720
Yeah, I mean, I think it has a place for people like that who are just going to use it to

36:58.720 --> 37:00.560
check mail or play games.

37:00.560 --> 37:05.440
I think that it could be more beneficial than a tablet because it gives you a little bit

37:05.440 --> 37:06.920
more flexibility.

37:06.920 --> 37:12.880
I just don't think it could ever replace, at least for me, a true operating system where

37:12.880 --> 37:17.080
I get file system access and stuff like that.

37:17.080 --> 37:23.320
I mean, it is compelling to be able to buy a $300 or $200 or $180 laptop that has Chrome

37:23.320 --> 37:24.640
and Android apps, but-

37:24.640 --> 37:28.480
And I could see people who are already heavily invested, they've got the Pro apps for all

37:28.480 --> 37:29.480
the different-

37:29.480 --> 37:30.480
Yeah.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.480
Oh, sure.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.480
I've got my juice SSH Pro, whatever, all the things-

37:32.480 --> 37:36.560
Or if games could actually work and there was a well-known game that comes out in the

37:36.560 --> 37:37.560
Play Store.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.560
That's true.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.520
West, let me ask you this because this move and instant apps, which I'm sure you're familiar

37:40.520 --> 37:44.120
with, you search for something in Google search and a link comes up and actually instead

37:44.120 --> 37:49.560
of taking you to a website, it launches just the bare minimum app from the Play Store on

37:49.560 --> 37:50.880
the fly.

37:50.880 --> 37:57.400
Mind-blowing is this move, Android apps coming to Chrome OS, which Chrome OS, the web operating

37:57.400 --> 38:00.520
system, the operating system for the web, the open web Google-

38:00.520 --> 38:01.720
Yeah, I'm sent you.

38:01.720 --> 38:04.520
Open web platform.

38:04.520 --> 38:13.520
Is this and instant apps a massively anti-web, anti-open web ecosystem move?

38:13.520 --> 38:18.280
Is this Google saying, you know what, you can't really have good app experiences in

38:18.280 --> 38:19.280
the browser.

38:19.280 --> 38:22.280
If you want good apps, you got to go native.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.280
I mean a little bit.

38:23.280 --> 38:27.040
I don't know if that's fully their intention but I can definitely see it as a potential

38:27.040 --> 38:28.600
consequence of that.

38:28.600 --> 38:33.360
I think they are still invested enough in the web that they don't – I don't think

38:33.360 --> 38:34.360
that-

38:34.360 --> 38:35.360
Sure.

38:35.360 --> 38:37.600
All of them, especially as the giant organization they are, could be invested in that.

38:37.600 --> 38:44.320
But you're right and it does build in that weird side premium extra layer that it just

38:44.320 --> 38:46.520
doesn't – it's not really standard.

38:46.520 --> 38:53.000
Well and as somebody – you got to wonder too like it really – I would rather just

38:53.000 --> 38:59.160
– if I go to the web and I search for something in Google on the web, there's a very high

38:59.160 --> 39:01.720
likelihood that I want a web result.

39:01.720 --> 39:02.720
Right.

39:02.720 --> 39:03.720
You're already using it.

39:03.720 --> 39:07.320
I don't want – if I want that app, I will go install that app.

39:07.320 --> 39:08.320
I find the whole thing-

39:08.320 --> 39:10.160
I have already been like frustrated by that.

39:10.160 --> 39:11.160
Yeah.

39:11.160 --> 39:16.320
So I guess it is – things are changing and Chrome OS is becoming a new beast that will

39:16.320 --> 39:21.160
be entirely competitive on a different level and I think Richard absolutely is right.

39:21.160 --> 39:26.680
If they don't nail the UI experience, which is going to be damn near impossible, I just

39:26.680 --> 39:30.880
don't see how serious users will want to use it outside of note taking apps and things

39:30.880 --> 39:32.520
like that.

39:32.520 --> 39:38.960
I guess, JM, I will give you the last words on this because it does kind of feel like

39:38.960 --> 39:43.440
a convergence of the two platforms in a sense using – because in a sense, if you look

39:43.440 --> 39:47.920
at that diagram, just core fundamental Linux technologies to bring the two together.

39:47.920 --> 39:48.920
Sure.

39:48.920 --> 39:53.520
I mean this has been the long term strategy with Chrome OS and Android.

39:53.520 --> 39:57.160
They've always planned to bring the two together eventually and they're going to

39:57.160 --> 40:02.040
be the premium place where developers will go to publish their apps because it will be

40:02.040 --> 40:03.040
Google first.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.040
Forget Windows.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.040
Forget Mac.

40:05.040 --> 40:08.040
It will be on Google's platform.

40:08.040 --> 40:09.040
Interesting.

40:09.040 --> 40:13.680
I think you're probably right and nothing else we can do other than watch at this point.

40:13.680 --> 40:14.680
So we move on.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.680
And talk about it.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.680
That's what we're here for.

40:16.680 --> 40:17.680
Yeah.

40:17.680 --> 40:18.680
And observe.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.680
And then when it lands, we're like, told you.

40:19.680 --> 40:22.200
You know what else they told you about is digital ocean.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.440
This is really where you should go to spin up infrastructure on demand.

40:24.440 --> 40:30.040
Now we know that the key decision you have to make is when you're using cloud computing,

40:30.040 --> 40:33.280
it has to be done on a system that's actually good.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.560
This is where digital ocean comes in.

40:34.560 --> 40:39.280
They've got data centers all over the world, all over the world, using Linux as the base

40:39.280 --> 40:45.200
operating system, KVM as the virtualizer, SSDs for all the disk IO, 40 gigabit e-connections

40:45.200 --> 40:49.600
into the virtualizers, Class A data centers all over the world.

40:49.600 --> 40:52.360
It is really, it's like nothing you could ever do without yourself.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.000
That's a beautiful picture.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.200
And then they come in there.

40:55.200 --> 40:59.240
They come in there with that crazy VC funding, that Hoopspa and that great product and all

40:59.240 --> 41:00.640
of a sudden they blow up.

41:00.640 --> 41:05.920
And they're able to offer you real time, I mean, like, well, less than 55 seconds, spin

41:05.920 --> 41:11.160
ups of virtual machines, starting at $5 a month for 512 megabytes of RAM, sorry, what?

41:11.160 --> 41:19.020
A 20 gigabyte SSD, a blazing fast CPU, and a terabyte of transfer with a batacle, batacle

41:19.020 --> 41:20.480
UI.

41:20.480 --> 41:26.320
Nothing like this you've ever seen to manage your digital ocean droplet, shoot, son.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.320
Girl please.

41:27.320 --> 41:31.360
I wish I had an interface like this, but then to back that up.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.360
The best API.

41:32.360 --> 41:33.360
Oh man.

41:33.360 --> 41:34.360
The best API.

41:34.360 --> 41:35.360
Woo!

41:35.360 --> 41:36.360
You know.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.360
First class.

41:37.360 --> 41:42.840
If you're, if you're an API snob, you're hanging out in the bar, you're talking about

41:42.840 --> 41:48.520
APIs with your API snobby friends, drinking your martinis.

41:48.520 --> 41:51.520
Digital ocean's the top of the list.

41:51.520 --> 41:54.440
Everybody talks about digital ocean.

41:54.440 --> 41:55.440
It's that API.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.440
It really is.

41:56.440 --> 41:59.440
What's great about it is there's tons of open source applications already written that you

41:59.440 --> 42:02.000
don't have to write yourself to take advantage of, so you can be super lazy.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.600
But if you hate all of them, the API docs are great, so you just write your own.

42:06.600 --> 42:09.160
And you know, back to that interface, back, back, back to that interface they got.

42:09.160 --> 42:13.600
They got HTML5 console so you can manage your machine from boot all the way up to post.

42:13.600 --> 42:17.680
One click application deployments.

42:17.680 --> 42:19.160
One thing you got to do though.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.160
One thing.

42:20.160 --> 42:21.160
Hold on, West.

42:21.160 --> 42:22.160
Let me make sure it's legit.

42:22.160 --> 42:23.160
Let me see.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.160
Double check.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.160
Double check.

42:25.160 --> 42:26.160
I'm checking here.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.160
Okay.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.160
Multiply that.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.160
Carry the two.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.160
Go this over here.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.160
Let's see.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.160
And I'll just run this crunch over here.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.160
Let's see here.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.160
Get it out of here.

42:34.160 --> 42:35.160
Oh yes.

42:35.160 --> 42:36.160
That's right.

42:36.160 --> 42:37.800
If you use the promo code DOUNPLUG, that's the thing they have to do.

42:37.800 --> 42:41.200
I thought it was just go there, create an amazing system, get your work done, experiment

42:41.200 --> 42:46.280
with something, put it into production, use whatever damn distro you think is best, and

42:46.280 --> 42:47.760
then enjoy their incredible documentation.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.680
I thought that's all I had to say.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.200
But then I remembered.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.940
We would like to do episode 147.

42:52.940 --> 42:53.940
We really would.

42:53.940 --> 42:56.000
So you got to use that promo code DOUNPLUG.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
That's the thing.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
Keep us here.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.000
You got to do that.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
You get a $10 credit.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.600
You try out their $5 rig, two months for free.

43:02.600 --> 43:03.880
Keep us going.

43:03.880 --> 43:09.680
Use that promo code DOUNPLUG and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplug

43:09.680 --> 43:11.600
program.

43:11.600 --> 43:16.800
Now Wes, there's this crazy upstart out there.

43:16.800 --> 43:18.360
I don't think Ryan's not in the Mamba Room, is he?

43:18.360 --> 43:19.360
He's not in there?

43:19.360 --> 43:20.500
No, I don't see him.

43:20.500 --> 43:25.340
There's this crazy project out there that's working on this thing to compete with Google

43:25.340 --> 43:27.680
Home or whatever they're calling it, the Amazon Echo.

43:27.680 --> 43:28.680
And we've talked about it before.

43:28.680 --> 43:30.840
It's called Mycroft.

43:30.840 --> 43:35.480
And recently, the Mycroft project released Mycroft Core 0.6 Alpha.

43:35.480 --> 43:36.480
Shipping.

43:36.480 --> 43:38.080
Shipping some code.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.520
And they put it up on GitHub.

43:40.520 --> 43:42.680
You can download it and get it running on Ubuntu.

43:42.680 --> 43:43.680
Whoa.

43:43.680 --> 43:44.680
What was that?

43:44.680 --> 43:46.200
What was that?

43:46.200 --> 43:47.560
I think that was a space-time distortion.

43:47.560 --> 43:48.560
I think so, yep.

43:48.560 --> 43:49.560
Yeah, we hit a micro fragment.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.880
That was the Mycroft AI in the future reaching back.

43:51.880 --> 43:52.880
That's exactly what I was thinking.

43:52.880 --> 43:53.880
Tell us to keep going.

43:53.880 --> 43:56.040
Because I was about to show you the Mycroft with his pants off.

43:56.040 --> 43:57.040
Look at this.

43:57.040 --> 43:58.680
Isn't it just so cute?

43:58.680 --> 44:00.300
This is the dev unit here.

44:00.300 --> 44:03.000
And if you're watching the video version, we have this linked, the video in the show

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
notes.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.560
The Mycroft with his pants off, so you can see all the guts here.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.600
And this thing is looking really good.

44:07.600 --> 44:10.560
This is just a prototype, right?

44:10.560 --> 44:11.560
I'm impressed.

44:11.560 --> 44:15.640
But what's so great about Mycroft in this Amazon Echo era now is...

44:15.640 --> 44:16.640
You mean besides their name?

44:16.640 --> 44:17.640
Yeah.

44:17.640 --> 44:18.640
Yeah, that is a great name.

44:18.640 --> 44:19.640
You're right.

44:19.640 --> 44:20.640
That is really brilliant.

44:20.640 --> 44:24.440
What's so great though, and it's not...what also is great is they're open sourcing tons

44:24.440 --> 44:28.820
of different code, but the thing that I really love about Mycroft, the thing that really

44:28.820 --> 44:34.000
gets me excited about Mycroft is you can just get Mycroft Core and install it on any damn

44:34.000 --> 44:35.360
thing you want.

44:35.360 --> 44:41.460
And that means I could truly, eventually, if I had the chutzpah and initiative, I could

44:41.460 --> 44:44.640
deploy Mycroft ubiquitously in my life.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.080
I could have it on my Kodi box.

44:46.080 --> 44:47.080
I could have it on my server.

44:47.080 --> 44:48.080
I could have it on my desktop.

44:48.080 --> 44:49.080
Mycroft.

44:49.080 --> 44:50.080
Start the show.

44:50.080 --> 44:55.960
I mean, it truly...because I'm not going to buy 50 Google Homes or 50 Amazon Echoes or

44:55.960 --> 44:56.960
whatever.

44:56.960 --> 45:00.360
But if I could get a couple of Mycroft devices where I don't want an easy button, and then

45:00.360 --> 45:03.520
I can install the software in all the other places, like my phone, like my desktop, like

45:03.520 --> 45:05.520
my laptop, like my server.

45:05.520 --> 45:06.520
Computers, whatever.

45:06.520 --> 45:07.520
Yeah.

45:07.520 --> 45:09.480
So, I know you've been playing around with it.

45:09.480 --> 45:10.960
I think Ham's been playing around with it.

45:10.960 --> 45:11.960
I don't know.

45:11.960 --> 45:12.960
Have you actually gotten started yet?

45:12.960 --> 45:15.200
Because it's pretty early days still.

45:15.200 --> 45:18.400
I haven't quite, but I haven't had time to look into too much of the configuration.

45:18.400 --> 45:19.400
What's the process like?

45:19.400 --> 45:24.120
Well, it's a Python app, and they have some nice scripts that'll install all the app dependencies

45:24.120 --> 45:25.680
for you and set up in a virtual environment.

45:25.680 --> 45:29.640
I haven't gotten the sound...I haven't gotten it working quite yet, but I'm sure if I play

45:29.640 --> 45:32.960
with it for a little bit longer, I'm excited to get it to work.

45:32.960 --> 45:36.600
Now, Ham, you were saying in chat earlier today that you've been playing with it too,

45:36.600 --> 45:37.600
yeah?

45:37.600 --> 45:39.600
Yeah, I actually got it working.

45:39.600 --> 45:45.460
I cloned the Git repo, and I read the README file.

45:45.460 --> 45:46.460
Super easy.

45:46.460 --> 45:52.360
It was 0.6.0, I couldn't get it to build, but they released a new version just a day

45:52.360 --> 45:57.640
or two later, 6.1, and that one built for me super easy.

45:57.640 --> 46:04.120
I rebooted the computer, like they said, opened the terminal, three terminal instances, and

46:04.120 --> 46:07.120
ran the commands they said, and I got Mycroft running.

46:07.120 --> 46:14.560
I said, hey, Mycroft, open up CNN.com, and it opened up CNN.com, opened up Thunderbird

46:14.560 --> 46:18.640
just fine, a few problems here and there, but it's pretty cool.

46:18.640 --> 46:19.640
That's great.

46:19.640 --> 46:24.120
Now, did you also have to create an account with the intent parsing service or something

46:24.120 --> 46:27.520
like that, which I guess is going to be...they're going to be moving to an open source solution,

46:27.520 --> 46:31.040
but right now, you have to go create an account somewhere, right?

46:31.040 --> 46:37.400
Oh, that is correct, sybaris.mycroft.ai, I think it is, yes, I did have to create an

46:37.400 --> 46:38.400
account there.

46:38.400 --> 46:41.220
But that's just pretty quick and simple, and that's just used to do some of the speech

46:41.220 --> 46:42.720
recognition, I guess?

46:42.720 --> 46:49.640
Oh, yeah, I signed in using my Google account, and so it took like two seconds to sign in,

46:49.640 --> 46:56.640
and I just said, Mycroft, pair up my device, and Mycroft gives me a little code.

46:56.640 --> 47:00.360
I put it in there, and I was paired within literally two minutes, is that...

47:00.360 --> 47:03.980
Can you try other things, like can you ask it for weather?

47:03.980 --> 47:08.480
Is there any additional things you can ask, or is it pretty basic right now?

47:08.480 --> 47:13.720
I asked, what's the weather, and it gave me the weather for some place in Kentucky or

47:13.720 --> 47:24.160
something, and I'm like, hey, Mycroft, change my location to Lewiston, Idaho, and it totally

47:24.160 --> 47:26.560
didn't get it at all.

47:26.560 --> 47:30.480
So does it feel sort of like a verbal command line right now, or does it feel like you're

47:30.480 --> 47:32.880
having a conversation?

47:32.880 --> 47:35.080
Like a verbal command line, it is not a conversation.

47:35.080 --> 47:39.280
I mean, when I asked, what's the weather, and it said, it's sunny out here, you better

47:39.280 --> 47:40.280
get your...

47:40.280 --> 47:44.040
It said, you better get your sunglasses.

47:44.040 --> 47:45.040
That's kind of fun.

47:45.040 --> 47:46.040
Yeah, that's kind of fun.

47:46.040 --> 47:47.040
Yeah.

47:47.040 --> 47:49.920
Yeah, I think there's two different types of assistance right now.

47:49.920 --> 47:57.040
I feel like Siri and Google Now and Amazon Echo really are very much...

47:57.040 --> 48:02.320
They're command lines, and if you learn to say things in this precise order, like, hey,

48:02.320 --> 48:06.160
they're googs, set a reminder for 5.30 PM.

48:06.160 --> 48:07.160
It works pretty well.

48:07.160 --> 48:09.240
And then they'll say, what would you like a reminder for?

48:09.240 --> 48:12.840
Remind me to tell Wes that he's awesome, and then it sets a reminder, right?

48:12.840 --> 48:15.720
And you have to very much walk through a sequence like that.

48:15.720 --> 48:21.720
And what the next generation of artificial intelligence is doing is more conversational.

48:21.720 --> 48:26.200
And you see, we're kind of there now, but they're not necessarily as reliable, because

48:26.200 --> 48:32.160
they depend on being able to suss out your intent and your context, whereas the command

48:32.160 --> 48:38.360
line is a little more intentional, a little more exact, and it can also be replicated

48:38.360 --> 48:39.360
on text.

48:39.360 --> 48:40.920
And that's where I really think...

48:40.920 --> 48:44.600
I was joking earlier, but I would love to see...

48:44.600 --> 48:49.080
So Mycroft has this intent engine, and I would love to see if this thing could be integrated

48:49.080 --> 48:50.080
at all different aspects.

48:50.080 --> 48:55.840
If it truly is, it's all open, and my desktop is open, could Mycroft intent be integrated

48:55.840 --> 48:59.100
into the app launcher to learn what apps I most frequently launch?

48:59.100 --> 49:04.260
Could Mycroft intent be integrated into my contacts application?

49:04.260 --> 49:11.760
Could this be a pervasive artificial intelligence system for the Linux desktop?

49:11.760 --> 49:18.520
Something that is not driven by necessarily a strategy tax by a larger parent company

49:18.520 --> 49:19.520
or something like that.

49:19.520 --> 49:24.520
I just find the possibilities to be really compelling, because it's not just a hardware

49:24.520 --> 49:25.520
box, right?

49:25.520 --> 49:26.520
Because it's software.

49:26.520 --> 49:30.200
If you really haven't got it working yet, and it's kind of hit and miss, it is possible.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.760
Ham's got the beginning version of it.

49:31.760 --> 49:35.160
And this is 0.6 alpha.

49:35.160 --> 49:36.160
That's really cool.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.800
Anybody else in the Mumble Room have any thoughts on the topic?

49:38.800 --> 49:39.800
Yeah.

49:39.800 --> 49:44.160
Oh, go ahead, Poppy, and then North.

49:44.160 --> 49:50.960
So I was at OSCON last week, and I met Ryan Sipes, the CTO of Mycroft AI, and I held one

49:50.960 --> 49:53.320
of the Mycrofts in my hand for the first time.

49:53.320 --> 49:54.320
I saw your tweet.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.320
That was great.

49:55.320 --> 49:56.320
Wow.

49:56.320 --> 49:57.320
Yeah.

49:57.320 --> 50:05.160
And he said to me that I asked about the voice stuff and whether the new voice was ready.

50:05.160 --> 50:07.320
And he said they've got a new version.

50:07.320 --> 50:12.080
They've been regenerating all the sounds.

50:12.080 --> 50:16.080
And he said there was a problem with one of the early ones that the voice sounded a little

50:16.080 --> 50:17.660
bit like Max Headroom.

50:17.660 --> 50:20.880
So we go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

50:20.880 --> 50:24.200
He really wanted to keep that in, but they decided, no, it would be unprofessional to

50:24.200 --> 50:25.200
do that.

50:25.200 --> 50:26.600
So we got rid of that, unfortunately.

50:26.600 --> 50:27.600
I really want that.

50:27.600 --> 50:29.360
Yeah, that would be maybe later.

50:29.360 --> 50:30.360
Maybe later.

50:30.360 --> 50:31.360
That would be good.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.920
So, Poppy, did you get it?

50:32.920 --> 50:36.240
Was the noise environment suitable to trying it at all?

50:36.240 --> 50:37.240
How was that like?

50:37.240 --> 50:41.160
Not really, because the conference center was just so noisy.

50:41.160 --> 50:45.320
Every so often you could, like randomly, it would start talking, and you'd see the little

50:45.320 --> 50:50.200
lips, the light lips moving on the front, and it was very cute when it's talking.

50:50.200 --> 50:53.160
But it was just way too noisy in there for us to get a good demo.

50:53.160 --> 50:59.440
So your thoughts just overall on integrating Mycroft at more than just, to me, and I wonder

50:59.440 --> 51:03.400
for you too, it seems to be more compelling than just a little hardware device.

51:03.400 --> 51:07.120
I would like to see that just be one representation of how I interact with Mycroft.

51:07.120 --> 51:11.080
Do you see it being much bigger than just a hardware device?

51:11.080 --> 51:16.880
So you were talking there about having access to your most recent apps and stuff, like most

51:16.880 --> 51:22.600
modern desktops have that kind of surfacing, that kind of data, or using stuff like Zeitgeist,

51:22.600 --> 51:25.240
which would keep track of which documents you've opened.

51:25.240 --> 51:30.520
If you could say to Mycroft, open the document I had open last Tuesday when I was listening

51:30.520 --> 51:34.360
to ABBA or something, because you remembered the document and what you were listening to

51:34.360 --> 51:35.360
at the time.

51:35.360 --> 51:40.600
That is kind of the purpose of Zeitgeist, that it records what you're doing all the

51:40.600 --> 51:41.640
time.

51:41.640 --> 51:48.320
So there's a data source there that could certainly be mined by Mycroft, and I think

51:48.320 --> 51:50.740
that would be awesome if it was all integrated together.

51:50.740 --> 51:57.240
The Mycroft project is an interesting one to watch because, boy, the timing is perfect.

51:57.240 --> 51:58.240
It really is.

51:58.240 --> 52:02.040
It was just – I'm so thrilled that we're not really behind the curve on this.

52:02.040 --> 52:05.880
It really felt like we were going to be missing out before Mycroft started getting all the

52:05.880 --> 52:07.120
momentum they have now.

52:07.120 --> 52:11.080
But since Ryan Sipes, who I think is just great.

52:11.080 --> 52:19.360
I think Ryan – he's a great – not only is Ryan very well spoken and he articulates

52:19.360 --> 52:20.360
the project's vision.

52:20.360 --> 52:22.880
He's a wonderful advocate.

52:22.880 --> 52:26.880
But he's also just a super nice guy to hang out with and chat with.

52:26.880 --> 52:31.300
He was going to join us today, but I'm assuming he's just super busy, because he had emailed

52:31.300 --> 52:34.180
me earlier today saying, hey, can I make it, and I said, yeah, absolutely.

52:34.180 --> 52:36.440
So that's totally understandable.

52:36.440 --> 52:37.440
I wonder –

52:37.440 --> 52:38.440
Come back any time.

52:38.440 --> 52:41.760
If he was here, what I would like to ask him – probably the hardest question I would

52:41.760 --> 52:45.280
have had for him is, is it getting too much?

52:45.280 --> 52:48.440
Is it growing too fast?

52:48.440 --> 52:57.200
Is this weird thing that – I don't know how to explain it, but I could tell that our

52:57.200 --> 53:03.960
audience was not super impressed by this update and was having a hard time parsing it.

53:03.960 --> 53:04.960
And so –

53:04.960 --> 53:05.960
It's pretty long and –

53:05.960 --> 53:12.200
It's long, dense, and it's not traditionally as well done as communication from the Mycroft

53:12.200 --> 53:13.360
project.

53:13.360 --> 53:18.720
And so I think it kind of fell a little flatter than maybe they were expecting, or at least

53:18.720 --> 53:23.360
I was expecting, because I think this is a bigger deal than people are realizing.

53:23.360 --> 53:28.760
And I don't know if every single stupid thing – well, it's not stupid, but if every single

53:28.760 --> 53:33.080
little thing needs a video with some hipster music and a tweet or what –

53:33.080 --> 53:34.080
Chris, you know that it does.

53:34.080 --> 53:35.080
Well, okay.

53:35.080 --> 53:36.080
That's probably true.

53:36.080 --> 53:37.080
Yeah.

53:37.080 --> 53:39.640
And a scrolly website.

53:39.640 --> 53:45.200
So maybe I just would like to ask him – and what I'm worried about is, does something

53:45.200 --> 53:49.560
like this that has not just their ideas of what would be great, but then once you start

53:49.560 --> 53:54.660
talking to other people and you start working with other groups, a lot of other ideas start

53:54.660 --> 53:57.320
getting brought into the mix.

53:57.320 --> 53:58.320
People start telling you, you should do this.

53:58.320 --> 53:59.320
You also got to do this.

53:59.320 --> 54:00.320
Get involved with this.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.320
Go to this event.

54:01.320 --> 54:02.320
Make sure you talk to these people.

54:02.320 --> 54:07.920
Make sure you talk – and I wonder if scope creep is becoming an issue at all.

54:07.920 --> 54:13.240
So maybe Ryan will join us soon and we can talk about that, because even from the perspective

54:13.240 --> 54:21.940
of managing an open source project that is fairly well watched, what's that like?

54:21.940 --> 54:24.920
What does that feel like?

54:24.920 --> 54:30.400
What happens if you decide you're going to hit your – like really Wimpy to some degree

54:30.400 --> 54:31.960
has this too with Ubuntu Mate.

54:31.960 --> 54:32.960
Absolutely.

54:32.960 --> 54:37.540
And of course, Richard has this with OpenSUSE.

54:37.540 --> 54:43.640
What is it like when all of a sudden you're dealing with something that is very, very

54:43.640 --> 54:44.640
heavily watched?

54:44.640 --> 54:47.800
Richard, do you have any thoughts just off the top of your head as I just sort of sprung

54:47.800 --> 54:48.800
this on you?

54:48.800 --> 54:49.800
Well, yeah.

54:49.800 --> 54:52.000
I mean, I guess I've kind of got an example today.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.280
I mean, we've just released 42.2 Alpha 1.

54:55.280 --> 54:57.780
Like we thought we knew the scope.

54:57.780 --> 54:58.780
We knew everything.

54:58.780 --> 55:02.240
And like the first bunch of feedback is, oh, we want this extra thing and this extra thing

55:02.240 --> 55:05.240
and this extra thing.

55:05.240 --> 55:12.080
But on one hand, you want to say yes to everything because it's – part of that's where the

55:12.080 --> 55:14.100
enthusiasm comes from.

55:14.100 --> 55:17.600
On the other hand, you can see if you say yes to everything, you're going to end up

55:17.600 --> 55:18.600
with an ungodly mess.

55:18.600 --> 55:19.600
Yeah.

55:19.600 --> 55:20.600
Absolutely.

55:20.600 --> 55:21.600
Like you get monster scope creep.

55:21.600 --> 55:22.600
NorthRanger, you had a positive spin.

55:22.600 --> 55:23.600
I'd love to hear that.

55:23.600 --> 55:24.600
Yeah.

55:24.600 --> 55:28.320
So you talk about what they've been out in the community talking about.

55:28.320 --> 55:30.600
You worry about the scope creep.

55:30.600 --> 55:34.660
I think you're totally right on the timing of this that I think their timing actually

55:34.660 --> 55:40.400
is good because people's awareness of these types of devices and these types of services

55:40.400 --> 55:46.760
is constantly increasing with Amazon Echo and Google Now and Siri.

55:46.760 --> 55:54.640
But all of those existing solutions are very much focused on Amazon wants to sell you stuff.

55:54.640 --> 56:03.720
Google wants to mine all your S. Whereas Mycroft, if you set aside what they're talking about

56:03.720 --> 56:09.960
and focus on what they've actually done, they're showing real hardware and they're releasing

56:09.960 --> 56:16.160
the core, the things that you have to get right, the speech recognition, the ability

56:16.160 --> 56:21.000
to create intents and create actions.

56:21.000 --> 56:25.160
And that's where I think the open source community can take in and run with it.

56:25.160 --> 56:26.160
Yeah.

56:26.160 --> 56:27.160
That's well said.

56:27.160 --> 56:32.200
And also just as a tip of the hat to the Mycroft project, when you go to sign up for that account

56:32.200 --> 56:35.320
where Ham said he just uses Google and you can just super quick get in there and get

56:35.320 --> 56:39.680
the speech recognition, they literally say, like, hey, if you want to help out and give

56:39.680 --> 56:43.240
us a little financial contribution, we're going to be able to replace this whole proprietary

56:43.240 --> 56:47.700
have to log in thing way faster and we'll have the open source solution ready to go.

56:47.700 --> 56:48.700
That's our direction we're going.

56:48.700 --> 56:50.320
We're going to get there one way or another.

56:50.320 --> 56:52.800
Here's a couple of ways you can help us get there faster.

56:52.800 --> 56:56.800
And you look at Mycroft as a project that was funded initially by the community and

56:56.800 --> 56:58.200
they're not done yet.

56:58.200 --> 57:04.240
And that, I thought, I thought what that represented was a super clever way to continue additional

57:04.240 --> 57:08.480
bits of funding because you know, you know that they can't just go raise, even if they

57:08.480 --> 57:12.840
raised five hundred thousand dollars, that money is going to run out when you start hiring

57:12.840 --> 57:16.200
people and you start having expenses and you start having to go to events and they're just

57:16.200 --> 57:20.000
like world class work here, you know, like these are the things that like, yeah, of course,

57:20.000 --> 57:23.500
they're having to like this is like, you have to outsource some of this stuff because right

57:23.500 --> 57:26.520
now all the solutions that anyone uses are proprietary.

57:26.520 --> 57:30.000
So they're like exploring new ground and doing work that a lot of them could be paid good

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
money to do.

57:31.000 --> 57:32.000
Yeah.

57:32.000 --> 57:37.360
So I think it's I really hope they come up with a solid revenue stream that doesn't necessarily

57:37.360 --> 57:39.260
involve data analytics of their customers.

57:39.260 --> 57:42.440
But it comes, you know, a great way to raise money that contributes back to the project

57:42.440 --> 57:45.040
because you want to see something like this continue.

57:45.040 --> 57:48.760
And it's really cool it's gotten this far because of community funding so far.

57:48.760 --> 57:50.320
And then, of course, open source development.

57:50.320 --> 57:51.320
All right.

57:51.320 --> 57:52.320
Let's take a moment.

57:52.320 --> 57:56.680
Speaking of community funding, it's time to talk about the Libram 11.

57:56.680 --> 58:03.000
It's called and dubbed the surface book for those of you who care about your privacy and

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
your freedom.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
What?

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
Okay.

58:06.000 --> 58:10.320
I have a few thoughts on this as somebody who funded their first attempt at crowdfunding

58:10.320 --> 58:11.920
hardware, the Libram 15.

58:11.920 --> 58:16.840
So come over here into the hallway with me for just a moment, Wes, and let's talk about

58:16.840 --> 58:19.200
Linux Academy.

58:19.200 --> 58:21.200
Linux Academy.

58:21.200 --> 58:22.200
Dot com.

58:22.200 --> 58:23.200
Go there now.

58:23.200 --> 58:24.200
Slash Unplugged.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.200
Slash Unplugged.

58:25.200 --> 58:26.200
You got to go there to get the discount.

58:26.200 --> 58:27.200
Go there now.

58:27.200 --> 58:28.200
And support the show.

58:28.200 --> 58:29.200
So, Wes, let's get real while we're out here in the hallway.

58:29.200 --> 58:30.720
If you don't know this, we're out in the hallway right now.

58:30.720 --> 58:31.720
We stepped out of the studio.

58:31.720 --> 58:34.020
The hallway always sounds like this.

58:34.020 --> 58:35.880
This is how it sounds at Jupiter Broadcasting Studios.

58:35.880 --> 58:36.880
Of course.

58:36.880 --> 58:37.880
We've got all these computers here.

58:37.880 --> 58:39.880
This is why it sounds like this.

58:39.880 --> 58:45.760
If you want to chill in the hallway, Wes, if you want to get your employer's attention,

58:45.760 --> 58:50.720
if you want to maybe do a little better on the next review or get a raise, you know one

58:50.720 --> 58:54.640
of the ways to do that is to continue your education and show them you're expanding your

58:54.640 --> 58:57.000
knowledge set.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.140
It's legitimately one of the best ways to get your employer's attention.

59:00.140 --> 59:03.680
It's one of the best ways to make you more employable and it's also a great way to challenge

59:03.680 --> 59:04.680
yourself.

59:04.680 --> 59:05.680
Linux Academy.

59:05.680 --> 59:06.680
Dot com slash unplugged.

59:06.680 --> 59:07.680
Come on.

59:07.680 --> 59:10.360
Step out here into the hallway with us and think about it just for a little bit.

59:10.360 --> 59:11.360
Go there and try them out.

59:11.360 --> 59:12.360
Linux Academy.

59:12.360 --> 59:13.360
Dot com slash unplugged.

59:13.360 --> 59:14.360
You get a discount.

59:14.360 --> 59:19.680
They have self-paced courses with two thousand four hundred and four to seven videos, scenario

59:19.680 --> 59:26.000
based labs that put you in the middle of everyday common tasks, instructor mentoring.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Could you imagine?

59:27.000 --> 59:28.000
You're standing out here in the hallway.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
Let Linux Academy tell you what to do.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
You're out here on the hallway.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.760
You're looking at your smartphone and you're thinking, you know what, I need help.

59:32.760 --> 59:34.200
They got it.

59:34.200 --> 59:35.200
Instructor mentoring.

59:35.200 --> 59:36.200
Because you're in the hallway right now.

59:36.200 --> 59:37.200
Right there.

59:37.200 --> 59:38.200
Linux Academy.

59:38.200 --> 59:39.200
Linux Academy.

59:39.200 --> 59:40.200
They got graded server exercises.

59:40.200 --> 59:41.200
Sign up.

59:41.200 --> 59:42.200
Right now.

59:42.200 --> 59:44.040
Because this is not neural programming.

59:44.040 --> 59:45.040
This is the hallway.

59:45.040 --> 59:46.040
OK?

59:46.040 --> 59:47.040
This is the hallway.

59:47.040 --> 59:49.040
This is not neural programming.

59:49.040 --> 59:50.040
Linux Academy.

59:50.040 --> 59:51.040
Dot com slash unplugged.

59:51.040 --> 59:52.040
You go there.

59:52.040 --> 59:53.040
You learn more.

59:53.040 --> 59:54.040
You got graded server exercises.

59:54.040 --> 59:56.680
So that way, if you're like me and you s' your pants when you gotta take a test.

59:56.680 --> 59:59.640
You know what I don't like is scenarios where there's no option other than win lose.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.000
I like a couple of options.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.680
I want a plan B. I want a plan B. Here, now come over here.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.880
Now let's step into the computer room.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.160
Yeah, OK.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:10.640
So here we are in the computer room now, Wes.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.360
Right next to the studio.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.880
We got data to crunch here, folks.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:16.880
Yeah.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.920
And the way we learned how to do that is Linux Academy.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.920
Linux Academy.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.920
Dot com slash unplugged.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920
They got the best courseware.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.920
I'm going to say it right now.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:23.920
The best courseware on the Red Hat stuff.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:27.080
Oh, you got stuck in the dev ops position all of a sudden.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.080
Oh, I shouldn't say stuck.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.080
I shouldn't.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.640
One, they'll tell you what that term means.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.160
Two, they'll tell you how to effectively use those tool sets.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.560
They've also got great, great courseware on Amazon Web Services, Android Development,

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.360
Ruby, OPHP, and their courseware comes with their servers.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.360
What?

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:48.400
Had we not mentioned that?

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.160
I got to say, I should have mentioned at the top.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.360
See, I'm a rookie here.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.680
I should have mentioned at the top.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.440
You get to choose from seven plus distributions.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.960
No, this is not neural programming.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:00:59.960
I'm just letting you know.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.960
OK.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:01.960
Seven.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:07.640
Seven plus distributions, and then they automatically adjust the courseware.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.640
Virtual machines.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.640
Crazy.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:10.640
They spin that up on demand.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.760
They spin up that, and it matches the courseware.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.040
Now think about that.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.960
That's how you know that they actually know how to use this stuff.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.040
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.040
Go check them out.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:22.040
They've got great instructor mentoring.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.760
They have a community stacked full of Jupiter Broadcasting members, and I think the other

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:30.080
thing that really speaks for them is they legitimately have constant results.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.080
It's really neat.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.440
And actually, I like it when you tweet me and you tell me about it, too.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.440
So thanks, you guys.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.440
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.280
All right.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.560
So we've stepped back into the studio.

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:43.840
We're no longer in the hallway or the computer lab or whatever that last room was.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:48.960
I want to talk about the Liebroom 10, a 10.1 inch two-in-one detachable laptop tablet designed

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.600
to protect your digital life.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:56.360
From the Purism folks, they say it's beautiful freedom, and they believe in users' rights.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.760
It's a tablet and a laptop.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.840
They say a ton of work to make the Gnome Shell ready for this.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:02.840
It ships up.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.280
Yeah, and it ships Pure OS, and they got a video.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.680
It doesn't really say much, but I guess I could read you the highlights because I don't

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.000
think there's actually any voiceover here.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.880
So they say, what's on your tablet?

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.620
Privacy isn't about what you want to hide.

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:27.380
It's about what you need to protect.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:33.960
If you could design the ultimate tablet, what would it be?

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.160
You are helping design your next computer.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.160
We are listening.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:39.240
Hey, it's Todd.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.440
Your current computer and service providers know more about you than anybody else.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:51.160
Apple, Google, or Microsoft hold the master key to your digital life.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:57.120
You want a computer designed to protect you rather than monitor you.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:03.040
Introducing the Liebroom 11, the latest computer from Purism designed by you to protect your

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:05.080
digital life.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:10.840
An 11-inch, two-in-one detachable privacy, security, and freedom-focused computer running

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:16.520
Pure OS 3.0 where you hold the master key to your entire digital life.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.520
All right.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:26.320
We've been to the Chris Last school of music overlays here.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:31.920
The Liebroom 11 turns off remote spying with hardware kill switches.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.320
It does not track you at all.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:37.000
Nor does it phone home to the parent company.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.080
The Liebroom 11 runs free software with the source code available to verify that it protects

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:44.120
your digital rights.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:04:00.000
And above all else, makes protecting yourself as easy as turning it on.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.800
At Purism, we believe protecting your digital rights should be easier than giving them up.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:13.140
We make hardware and software that is designed to protect your digital life.

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:18.080
In order to achieve this goal, Purism has amassed an amazing team of the best freedom

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:30.560
operators from all over the world.

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:33.760
With your help, Purism will continue leading the way in protecting everybody's digital

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.760
life.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.760
Thank you.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.760
Man.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.880
I'll tell you what, I'm pretty stoked about that hammock in the back of Todd's yard there.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.880
That's nice.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.920
That shows he's got good taste.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.920
That looks comfy.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.200
I'm more confident now.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:49.880
So the Liebroom 11, a two-in-one tablet that protects your privacy.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:53.040
They want to raise $150,000.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.160
They have two months left, so it's a real long one over on IndieGoGo.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.060
Real nice and long one.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:08.080
And they've so far raised $12,455 with only 11 backers.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.480
Eleven backers.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.480
Starting at $999.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:16.160
You can get a $599 if you want a less capable one.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:22.640
So, I got a lot of thoughts on this, but I guess I wanted to open it up to you first,

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.120
Wes, and then I'll toss it over to the Mumba Room after that.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.120
What do you think?

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:30.440
Do you, at this point, what is just your initial thoughts?

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:33.640
I mean, people might not be fully familiar with my history with the company, so that

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:37.200
aside, what is just your initial thoughts on something like this?

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.440
There are some good things and some bad things.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:42.680
They're very zoomed in on this core M processor here on the page, which has me a little off

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:43.680
but already.

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.480
But I think the video was good.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:50.200
I think there are some people with very good intentions behind this.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.120
Bringing in your history there, I do have some questions about if they'll be able to

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:58.480
ship it, what it really will look like, and I also don't know how much I'm that interested

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:03.440
in the tablet two-in-one workflow anyway.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:06.120
Here's my question.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:11.720
I don't know how to state this in a way that doesn't – that maybe if you're not already

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:20.160
there with me, you might not understand, but inherently, would you agree or disagree that

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:24.760
one of the features of a tablet is build quality?

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.760
Yeah, I agree.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.760
I mean –

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.880
And would you agree or disagree that one of the features of a tablet is content consumption

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.000
and therefore its ecosystem?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.280
Yep.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:39.120
And would you agree that one of the things of a tablet that makes it compelling to a

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:45.640
large market is a healthy accessory ecosystem, maybe like cases for kids, charging stations

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:50.120
for people that want to have multiple charging options, Bluetooth speakers that have holders

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:54.200
that are – you know, like connector speakers and chargers that hold alarm clocks and things

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.200
like that.

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.680
It's an ecosystem that I would say you could say makes a tablet viable.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.320
Would you agree with that to some degree or not?

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:02.320
No.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:07.120
I mean I think I see what you're saying and that – I mean right there, that limits

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:12.040
the scope of who could be interested in this.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:15.320
I mean if – I'm really curious to see what they – you said they've done a lot

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:16.800
to the Nome Shell.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.560
It would be really interesting to see this succeed.

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:21.920
I don't – you know, I don't want to preclude this being an awesome product.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:27.040
Well, I mean for a tablet, so it's going to have Linux, 16 gigabytes of RAM, user-upgradable

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:31.400
easily removable screws, six to eight battery lives, hardware kill switches for wireless

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:35.400
Bluetooth camera, microphone, GPS, and the cellular data if you get it.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.400
Oh, wow.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.400
Cellular data.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.400
Yeah.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:45.800
So I think it ties back with the laptop, you know, with the – there's a lot of things

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.320
here that I could really like and I'd love to see it succeed.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:53.060
I don't know that it will and I don't know that what percentage of success that

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:55.320
they do achieve will be enough to make it worthwhile.

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.320
Hmm.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:02.720
Anyone in the room have any thoughts about – I mean is this a good pivot?

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:07.060
Is this maybe a pivot from building – trying to compete in the traditional laptop space

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:11.200
and saying we're going to go after this sort of niche here, this surface niche?

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:19.480
Yeah, because what the year they were competing in before, there were a lot of providers like

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:24.400
– in Europe there's Antroer and Schenker and PC Specialists.

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:28.240
There were a lot of boutique companies that just repackaged clearful products.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:34.880
But there doesn't seem – from these companies, there doesn't seem any proper surface competitors.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:40.260
So I think it's a nice niche to go into and from my experiences with my brother Surface

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:45.200
Pro and with Gnome, I really, really want to experience how Gnome works on a proper

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:50.360
tablet because I think it would be a very good experience of having a full desktop into

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.600
a tablet with a good desktop environment that integrates both ideas.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.840
So I think it's a good idea.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:00.320
Toby, what are your thoughts on it?

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:06.400
As someone who worked on a product which landed on a tablet that got some interesting feedback

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:13.080
recently, I would say the thing they need to nail is not just the hardware build quality

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:17.840
but people can be quite forgiving of hardware build quality if it's at the right price

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:24.560
point but what they often can't forgive is poor quality or unfinished software.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:32.360
If they don't get that nailed, then people who've backed it might revolt slightly.

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:38.960
Do you think they could spend say several months with Gnome 3 Shell and get Gnome Shell

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:43.160
in a state that is usable in a touch environment?

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.760
To be fair, I haven't used Gnome Shell for a long time.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.120
So I don't know what state it's in in a touch environment.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.480
I haven't got it on any machines that have got a touch screen.

01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.480
So I don't know.

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:54.280
And I don't know how touch-oriented.

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:59.000
I know everyone who sees any operating system that has big icons immediately erroneously

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:05.480
thinks it's a touch UI but I don't know how well Gnome Shell is suited to touch at the

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:06.480
moment.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.480
So I don't know how far they've got to go.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.680
I just think they need to focus on that quite hard.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.840
I think it comes down to the apps.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.520
I think the Shell does okay.

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:17.800
I mean I've used it on like not a great, some like mediocre touch interfaces and like launching

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.360
apps and that kind of stuff is fine.

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.440
It'll depend on like, you know, if you use Chromium it'll do well or Chrome, maybe some

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:26.000
other web browsers less so or similar for the rest of your apps.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.640
You know, if you're using Linux apps that just aren't going to work with touch, it's

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.640
going to be painful.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:30.640
But…

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.640
Yeah.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.960
What about like gestures and pinching and things like that?

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:38.480
So I have not read through the whole post where they say all the work they did for Gnome

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.200
but I know they did address some of that.

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.920
They also – they said they're going to eventually have optional docking station features

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:48.080
like a power connector, an RJ45 Ethernet port, HDMI out, two USB ports.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.080
I'm really…

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:53.240
Like how they solved the fan problem with not having a fan.

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.240
Yeah that is nice.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:55.240
That was my solution too.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.720
I guess they just adopted my solution from their laptop problem.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:05.380
Now I look at this and I think to myself it's really, really, really a difficult position

01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:12.320
to be in, to be a project out in the open like this, hardware or software, and be crowdfunded

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.640
and have to publicly fail a few times, which a lot of companies and a lot of initiatives

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.560
and a lot of projects do.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.560
But now…

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.560
But this is right out in the open.

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.560
Yeah.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.920
This could be Pureism abandoning the laptop line and – like this you could see two ways.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:30.720
This could be Pureism abandoning the laptop line and moving over – or not abandoning.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.980
That's the wrong way to put it.

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:40.360
This is Pureism redirecting their attention and getting distracted by a Shiny and not focusing

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:50.400
on just nailing and really making something good and then moving on to the next thing.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.520
They feel like they haven't finished the last thing.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:59.180
But you could also look at it and say this is a company that is recognizing the competitive

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:05.800
landscape and wants to contribute something unique and cater to a market that wants that

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:12.560
product but wants to have some of their essential requirements met.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.360
And they're recognizing that and saying you know what we couldn't nail this but we think

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.360
we can nail that and so we're going to pivot and we're going to try to make that our

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.360
thing.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.360
That's also reasonable.

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.560
If they would actually literally say that then it would be like well you admit your

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.840
mistake but they haven't done so.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:29.840
Well that's true.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:30.840
That's a good point.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:31.840
Yeah.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.840
No.

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:33.840
True.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:34.840
But I'm just of two minds of this thing.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:35.840
Right.

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:36.840
I look at it and I go I don't know.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.520
It would be really cool to have a Linux tablet that I loved using.

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.520
That would be awesome.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.520
Yeah.

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:46.520
I look at that and I go geez a quad core, micro SD slot, HDMI out, docking station.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:53.400
If the keyboard clip in business works well and it doesn't feel chintzy then that would

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400
be great.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.400
All right.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400
Jama Biz.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.040
I don't know how you say your head on JMA, BBZ.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.040
Go ahead.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.040
Your thoughts on crowdfunding.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.040
Yeah.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:06.520
I mean with crowdfunding you are essentially not buying a product.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.080
You're just investing in the hope that – and they have managed to get a product out.

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.040
It wasn't very good.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.840
Hopefully this one will be better.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:17.320
We'll have to wait and see.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:21.160
But they are trying and hopefully they're contributing back to knowing that as always

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:24.320
there's a risk with crowdfunding and people need to be aware of that.

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:31.700
Well I want to say they contacted us after my Librem 15 review which you guys can go

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:33.120
find on your own.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:37.240
And they said well would you be willing to try the Librem 13 because we really think

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.560
we did a much better job with the Librem 13.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.860
We got a better hardware partner.

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.560
We had a chance to do it better.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:46.280
Would you be willing to look at that?

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.240
Him and I haught about it because I'm not a big 13-inch laptop guy.

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:54.000
I'm more of a 15-inch laptop person.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.560
And I was a little burned, right?

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:59.560
I was a little burned by them so I thought that might influence my review.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.680
So what I decided should have Noah review it.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.140
That guy loves 13-inch laptops, loves them.

01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.760
And he didn't get burned by the 15-inch laptop.

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.400
No skin off his back.

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:15.200
So on this week's episode of the Linux Action Show, on Sunday's episode, we're going to

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.760
review the Librem 13.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:23.320
It's not that I want to keep doing all these hardware reviews over and over again but every

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.240
single day I get an email about the perfect Linux laptop.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:31.900
And every single week on Reddit I see a thread about the perfect Linux laptop.

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:35.720
And once a month somebody on Hacker News talks about how they have found the perfect Linux

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:36.720
laptop.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:37.720
It's talked about all the time.

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:40.800
So we're going to look at the Librem 13 on the Linux Action Show and see if they nailed

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.800
that product.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:46.480
And my estimation is, depending on how well they did that, when they got another chance,

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.960
how well they did on the Librem 13, if they nailed that, if Noah says they did a great

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:50.960
job.

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:53.360
Because that is really the test is like you just need to keep some amount of people that

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.040
will keep funding them and letting them progress.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.440
And the brown bear loves himself the 13-inch laptop.

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:05.100
So if they nailed the 13-inch laptop then I think this might be a viable project.

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.920
You could rely on them to really be able to iterate on something.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:08.920
So we'll see.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:09.920
I don't know.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.920
I specifically asked him not to really give me any details about it.

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.360
I want to find out during the show.

01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:15.720
So he's had it for like three weeks or something.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.360
Sounds like a good one to watch live.

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.360
Yeah.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.840
Which has been interesting because he's received like maybe four.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:20.840
I don't know.

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:21.840
He's had it for a while.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.540
And he got it like during the Oryx.

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.760
So he's had the Oryx and the Librem side by side.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.760
Yeah.

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.000
It should be a really interesting review.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.560
So we'll talk about that on Sunday's show.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:36.600
But we'll have links to this crowdfunding campaign if you want to go get yourself one.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.600
Maybe just hang out.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.160
I think it's got two months.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:41.720
It's a long one.

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:46.240
So maybe just wait for a little bit and see where it goes.

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.560
If you want to support something today, check this out, Wes, patreon.com slash today.

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.720
That's where you go to fund the network.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.780
Now this page is all jacked up.

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.960
It's got like stuff on there about Tech Talk today.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:00.040
It's got a video of me with like an old hairstyle, which is just hard to look at.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.040
How to date.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.040
90s.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.040
Whew.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.000
But none of that matters.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Go there anyway.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
What it's really about-

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Put your credit card in.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
What is-

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Chris, put on the confusion thing.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
I'm putting it right now.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
I'm putting it there.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Okay.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Wait.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
No.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Nothing.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Nothing.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Let's go to the hallway.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Yeah.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Okay.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Hold on, Wes.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
We'll go to the hallway.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Hold on, Wes.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
We're on the hallway.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Just you and me.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Nobody's here.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Tell them about Patreon.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.400
Patreon.com slash today.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:31.480
This is where you go to support the Jupiter Broadcasting Network and orient our compass

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.160
towards our audience.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.520
Now I say that in a really kind of nice, fancy way, right?

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.800
Orient our compass towards our audience.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:38.800
What does that really mean?

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.800
I'll tell you, Wes.

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:40.800
Well, it's just because we're out in the hallway.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:41.800
It's just you and me.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.800
Tell us, Chris.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:43.800
If we were in the hallway, I wouldn't say this.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.800
Tell us now.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.680
Advertising on the web is only going to work for so long.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:50.920
It's eventually going to go bust.

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.400
I'll say it right now.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:58.920
And if you've read the New York Times recently, you know that NPR and a bunch of other podcast

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:02.360
advertising brokers are going to screw it all up for all of us.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.820
They're really messing it up bad.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:08.040
They want Apple to create its own garden system around podcasting.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.960
Google Play now has its own walled garden that has its own stats and re-hosts our files.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.840
It is, Wes, if we weren't out in the hallway right now, right now legitimately standing

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.640
in the hallway, I wouldn't say this.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.120
It ain't going to work much longer.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:26.440
That's why I think we've talked about crowdfunding today from a multiple set of angles.

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.840
I think this is a big one.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:34.360
What it really does is it makes your priority your crowdfunding source.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:37.960
Your priority is going to be what your funding source is.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.320
That I think is really all you need to know.

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:43.640
And we want our priority to be the audience, patreon.com slash today.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:47.520
Now I don't want to say more than that because we're in the hallway.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:49.600
If we were in a different room, I might say something else.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.480
But that's all I want to say about it.

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:56.280
You might also find an extended live edition of this show.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:00.040
Extended live.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.160
Extended live edition of this show at patreon.com slash today.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.160
Full featured.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160
601 patrons.

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160
That's really great.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.160
We're getting close.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.560
Well, by close I mean we need to double that.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.760
But once we double that, subscribe again, then three times, then I'll do all these shows

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:15.760
topless.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:18.760
Oh, boy.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:26.600
Or, or pay five dollars more than that and Chris wears two shirts.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.600
Oh, man.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:31.320
I was waiting to see what you'd say about that.

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.320
No, I'm kidding.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.480
But patreon.com slash today.

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:36.800
We are beginning to post the live recordings of our shows.

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:37.800
The whole thing.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.800
I love it.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:39.800
I was already recording the live stream.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.800
Were you really?

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:41.800
Oh, yeah.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.800
Well, it's more fun.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.360
I love the live stream.

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:45.360
They are better, right?

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:48.240
And sometimes I can't be there or I'm out and about or whatever.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.300
And so now you guys do all the hard work for me.

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:53.080
And since I'm a patron already, like, it's an awesome benefit.

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.360
Yeah, it's an early system.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.360
We're still setting it up.

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:58.860
But if you want to get in on it, what essentially it lets you do is we're posting a few shows

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:00.960
throughout the week, the entire live stream.

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:06.640
Now I think it's funny because I don't know if people really like jumped on it, but I

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:12.500
posted the tech snap one and that's the first time we have ever showed any live clips.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.280
We've never do outtakes in tech snap.

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.360
It's nothing like that filtered out.

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:17.560
It's just what's in there.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:22.640
And the moment, my favorite moment in that, and it's right there if you're a patron, is

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.420
it starts with Alan troubleshooting his microphone.

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:36.240
And what is revealed is that A, Alan Jude has a favorite USB port and B, Alan Jude broke

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.660
his favorite USB port.

01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:40.600
And so the whole thing is quite funny.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.300
And it's just it's a brilliant example of what happens on the live stream before tech

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:47.220
snap that no one ever sees unless you make it.

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:48.760
Totally different show.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:52.960
And now with this new Linux powered OBS rig we have here doing this extra work and all

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:57.480
these extra sat coms we got going, we thought now is the point.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:00.440
Now we can finally contribute back to our patrons.

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:05.240
And we specifically had a milestone we wanted to reach to be able to financially do that.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.360
And it worked out perfectly.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.760
As we crossed that milestone, the hardware went into place.

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:11.760
That's awesome.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.040
And now we're delivering those exclusives to our patrons.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.040
Patreon.com slash today.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.040
You start at the three dollar level.

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.200
You go all the way up, they got swag levels, we got all that.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.480
Them people over there are crazy.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:23.440
Just ignore everything else on the page that doesn't well, you actually it's been getting

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:24.440
updated over time.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.000
It's been getting quite fancied up.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.600
We got like a new cord cutting level.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:29.600
If you're a cord cutter.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.600
Yeah, like your Netflix.

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.600
$10 or more.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:32.600
Yeah, read that.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:35.200
You're a cord cutter.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:39.060
You decided mainstream cable isn't how you want to consume content anymore.

01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:42.680
And it turns out J.B. has just what you need.

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:46.400
This level means you support content that is tailored to your technical needs and you

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.720
are still saving money.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:48.720
That's true.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:49.720
Ten dollars a month is nothing.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:50.720
Yeah, I know.

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:51.720
Right.

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:52.720
I know.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:53.720
So check it out.

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:54.720
Patreon.com slash today.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.720
You support the whole network.

01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.240
And we have big things coming that we want to accomplish in 2016 that I feel like now

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:01.240
you've proven it right.

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:03.760
Like you've shown like you give more money, you get more.

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:04.760
I feel like we have.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:09.240
I feel like we've delivered and I want Chris to go live in an RV and travel around the

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.240
country.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.240
Bam.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.240
He'll do it.

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.840
But what really it's about is it's not about me.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:19.360
It is it is about being able to launch new shows and not have to think about sponsors

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.360
first.

01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:23.840
It's about being able to determine what what six hundred and one people like, not what

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.320
a hundred thousand people might like.

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.760
See, one of the fundamental problems we have at the Jupiter Broadcasting Network and it

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:34.560
is literally our biggest competitive disadvantage is we cover Linux and open source.

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.080
And it's the stuff we love and that's why we cover it.

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.320
But it is the niche of the niche.

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.400
Technology podcasting is a niche.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.700
Open source and Linux is a niche within that.

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:47.920
Like Mac and Windows are niches within that category.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:52.200
Imagine right where desktop Linux and the concerns of the open source community fit

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.240
within that overall consumer market.

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:55.240
We're tiny.

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.240
We're absolutely tiny.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.960
And that's why you don't see us often featured in iTunes.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:02.880
That's why you don't necessarily see us listed in Pocket Cast network list.

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:06.440
Because you'll see you'll see tight you'll see networks that literally get half the downloads

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:11.220
we get listed there simply because they cover topics that appeal to a wider audience.

01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:15.760
So one of our major competitive disadvantages is that we talk about Linux and open source.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.440
But at the same time, that's our biggest competitive advantage because that's all we're really

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:20.440
about.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.160
We really dig into that stuff on these shows.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:26.040
And if you enjoy that content, if that is something that's provided value to you or

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:30.760
something that you just have listened to over and over again and enjoyed, patreon.com slash

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:35.480
today we need you because we do not have the advantages that some of the other podcast

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:42.040
networks have by covering Apple and iPhones and everything Google does and all of that

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:47.400
extra crap that we're all sick and tired of hearing about all the time.

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:52.400
And so that's why we're really, really hoping that we can funnel more attention to our Patreon

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:57.280
and grow that because that really then unhinges us and allows us to go cray cray cray cray

01:22:57.280 --> 01:22:58.280
Wes.

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.440
And it's great to have a system like Patreon where you really can just give money right

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:04.920
to the awesome people who make the show and you get a little extra bonuses.

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:08.060
Patreon.com slash today.

01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:11.600
Thank you everybody who does support us.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.040
And that brings us to the end of this week's episode of The Unplugged Program.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.080
Oh Wes.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.720
I feel like we could go on more and more.

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:22.620
The whole episode had a thread through it and I find that to be interesting since it's

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:24.320
not really intentional with this show.

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:29.960
This is The Unplugged Program and you can hang out with us live over at jblive.tv, JupiterBroadcasting.com

01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:33.640
slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:37.080
If you want to think bots do it, I'll let you believe that.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.080
I'll let you believe that.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:39.080
It's fine.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.700
We have a mumble room if you want to participate in our virtual lug.

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:46.160
And last but not least, we love your feedback at linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.160
Join us in the hallway.

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:51.600
All right everybody, thank you so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Unplugged.

01:23:51.600 --> 01:24:18.480
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:40.760
All right, so before we start the show, Mr. Corpse brought it up in the mumble room and

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.760
it's amazing.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.040
Holy smokes.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.960
When I got on the live stream today, this was still at three million.

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:47.520
It's already at four million.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.440
Wow, so this is the Pebble 2, Time 2 and the new Pebble Core.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.040
It already has 21,000 backers with 36 days left to go.

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:56.640
They had a goal of a million dollars.

01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:03.400
They've now raised four million dollars and this is very perfect timing because some of

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.160
the discussions we're going to get into today are very much around open source projects

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:11.760
like the Mycroft device and others that are open crowd funded.

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.800
Open source, open different, not necessarily Kickstarter, but different methodologies of

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.800
funding.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:20.760
This is one of the all-time big names on Kickstarter launching this today.

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:22.520
I think it's kind of perfect timing.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:29.800
I don't hear anything though, it's all screwed up.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.160
I don't know what happened there.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:36.040
That was really signed up pretty well too, it's kind of a shame.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.040
I don't know.

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.040
Let's go HTML5.

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:42.160
Damn it Linux, why are you doing this to me now?

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.160
What's going on baby?

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:44.160
Don't you love me?

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.160
Don't you love me Linux?

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:57.480
You know I watched this not 35 minutes ago and we're just fine.

01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.920
Mustaches dude, mustaches.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.680
Well okay let's bust it out, let's go into the lab, let's figure out what's going on

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:05.680
here.

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.840
I'm going to pop and lock my audio interface.

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:13.440
Stand by, live hotswap in progress.

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:25.920
Okay, hold on, hold on, reswapping, utilizing gnome extension to re-default, sound interface

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:34.520
recognized, original output selected, refreshing web page, activating video.

01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:38.040
Hey, I did it, nice.

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.760
I want to reset that up in purpose.

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.400
You're an IT wizard.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:55.400
Not only did that solve the problem, but there were sound effects and live commentary.

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.520
See that's how you know I used to do IT, right there.

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:03.080
Okay now shut up Wes, we're going to start over again because I want that S to be smooth,

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.080
okay?

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.080
All right?

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.080
Okay?

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.080
Man.

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:21.440
I almost blew that ass Wes.

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:24.520
Now this is almost perfect timing for the big show today.

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.600
Wait no that's not, damn it, see now I'm all off.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.600
Damn, man.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.600
We're the cute little show.

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.200
OMG, OMG, OMG.

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.760
I'm too warm Wes, I'm too warm.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:37.760
All right, fine.

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:38.760
Hear what?

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:39.760
The jacket's coming off.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:43.360
Even though I love this matte jacket, which Wes commented on, it's a nice Ubuntu matte

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:48.240
jacket that was sent to me by Mr. Wimpy and I really like it.

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:53.400
And it was pleasant in here until the damn log guy started doing his thing.

01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:58.240
So now, if y'all can get your crap together, we're going to start over, okay?

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:11.040
And we're not going to call it the big show.
