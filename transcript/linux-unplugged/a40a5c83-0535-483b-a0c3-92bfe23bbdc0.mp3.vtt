00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
I have a really embarrassing story to start with.

00:02.400 --> 00:03.400
Oh, yes.

00:03.400 --> 00:07.700
So, I know I'm going to get crap about this all the time by sharing this, but I have to

00:07.700 --> 00:11.900
just let you know, so in case the audience out there runs into this, they know what the

00:11.900 --> 00:12.900
fix is.

00:12.900 --> 00:18.680
So, you know, last week, Wes, like a champ, you set up a Starbound server during the show,

00:18.680 --> 00:19.680
and that evening...

00:19.680 --> 00:20.680
That was fun.

00:20.680 --> 00:26.320
So that evening, I was kind of in a unique position because, you know, when you live

00:26.320 --> 00:31.080
in a tiny home, when you get offered to house-sit for somebody in downtown Seattle, you take

00:31.080 --> 00:32.080
that up.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.080
Hey, that sounds nice.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.960
By the way, that's a little relationship pro-tip too, and that offer comes along, you've got

00:35.960 --> 00:36.960
to try to accept that.

00:36.960 --> 00:37.960
You say, yes.

00:37.960 --> 00:38.960
Yes.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.960
So, we go down and we start house-sitting Tuesday evening, we were going to, you know,

00:41.960 --> 00:49.240
wake up there Wednesday morning, and I get down there, and I don't have any Wi-Fi access.

00:49.240 --> 00:53.000
The password, they didn't leave it on the notes, we can't get a hold of them, I can't

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
get on the internet.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.200
So, in a moment of panic, because I want to play Starbound.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.200
Naturally.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.080
I turn on tethering on my phone, I'm like, I'm just going to use phone data, this is

01:01.080 --> 01:02.080
important.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.080
Thank you, Ting.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.080
Yeah.

01:04.080 --> 01:07.800
And I connect, and I start playing, and I'm wondering, is Wes online?

01:07.800 --> 01:10.320
And I'm playing along, and all of a sudden I notice that I'm having kind of a hard time

01:10.320 --> 01:11.760
controlling and looking around.

01:11.760 --> 01:12.760
Okay.

01:12.760 --> 01:18.240
I can't really explain why, but I keep seeming to get this intermittent freeze, or pause

01:18.240 --> 01:19.240
in the game.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.240
Bop, bop.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.240
Bop, bop.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.240
Every three, four seconds.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.240
Maybe every three seconds.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.240
Bop.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.240
Bop, bop.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.600
And it's like, you know, when you're in a battle or something, it's just enough to kill

01:27.600 --> 01:28.600
you.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.600
It's just not untenable.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.600
And it's really, it was like, really distracting.

01:30.600 --> 01:34.720
And I'm like, well, maybe I have a video driver problem.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.720
Maybe I have a power manag-

01:35.720 --> 01:36.720
Sure.

01:36.720 --> 01:37.720
Sure.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.720
There's a lot of options.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.720
Yeah.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.720
I start looking, maybe it's a power management setting, like a CPU frequency.

01:40.720 --> 01:44.800
And I'm chatting with Rekai, and I'm tethered to my phone, and I'm looking up stuff online,

01:44.800 --> 01:45.800
and I'm-

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
You're in full troubleshooting mode.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.480
This is like, this is not how I was going to use my mobile data, but now I got to know,

01:49.480 --> 01:53.240
and like, we're down, we're house sitting, and of course my lady, she's like, so do you

01:53.240 --> 01:55.240
want to come out on the deck, or-

01:55.240 --> 01:56.240
Yeah, we're going to hang out on the deck.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.240
What are you doing?

01:57.240 --> 01:58.240
Yeah, I got this bottle of wine here.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.240
What are you doing?

01:59.240 --> 02:00.240
And I'm like, I got to fix this.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.680
This is important.

02:01.680 --> 02:06.480
And I dig around, and I dig around, and I'm starting, and I'm trying things.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.920
I'm adding kernel boot parameters.

02:08.920 --> 02:13.080
I'm tweaking the X config according to the Arch Wiki for Skylake graphics.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.320
I'm making all these modifications to my system, and I'm rebooting, and I'm rebooting, and

02:16.320 --> 02:17.320
I'm rebooting.

02:17.320 --> 02:21.240
And one of the times I log in, the problem's fixed.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.240
Oh.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.920
That diggity dang, that link Rekai found me about the kernel parameter fixed it.

02:25.920 --> 02:26.920
Look at that.

02:26.920 --> 02:32.920
And I go to hit one of my keys, and I realize that nothing happens because none of my extensions

02:32.920 --> 02:33.920
are loaded.

02:33.920 --> 02:34.920
Oh.

02:34.920 --> 02:40.680
So I quickly go remove the kernel boot parameter, reboot again with extensions off.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.240
The game doesn't have the glitch.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.720
I log out of Gnome login with extensions on.

02:44.720 --> 02:45.720
The glitch is back.

02:45.720 --> 02:46.720
The glitch is back.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.920
And I start to notice that the glitch also exists in video playback.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.240
It exists sometimes when just moving the mouse really quickly.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.720
I start noticing, like, when I'm dragging Nautilus windows around, I can see that glitch,

02:55.720 --> 02:57.640
and I'm like, what is going on here?

02:57.640 --> 03:00.520
It's interesting that the plugin has the ability to cause so much trouble.

03:00.520 --> 03:06.720
So I discovered it was my system monitor Gnome extension, which is a really cool system monitor

03:06.720 --> 03:10.360
extension that puts all of your hardware devices in an icon, just icons.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.880
And so instead of having, like, all of these moving menu meters and stuff like that up

03:13.880 --> 03:17.800
in your toolbar, you have an icon that represents your CPU and your disk and your NIC, and you

03:17.800 --> 03:22.160
click those, and it drops down, and you get an expansive dropdown menu of your entire

03:22.160 --> 03:23.640
system resources.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.640
Well.

03:24.640 --> 03:27.000
It sounds nice enough.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.480
And I've had plenty of these over the years.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.960
Since Gnome 2, I've used things like system monitor.

03:30.960 --> 03:36.280
I did a little digging around, and it turns out there is actually a current issue on their

03:36.280 --> 03:38.040
GitHub about this.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.720
The extension causes stutter and lag in video players is where they noticed it.

03:41.720 --> 03:47.480
And there are some fixes that have been proposed, but what I did is I just did a purging of

03:47.480 --> 03:48.480
anything.

03:48.480 --> 03:53.080
So it turns out, by reading through this bug, that what it really comes down to, it's not

03:53.080 --> 03:56.300
actually Gnome's fault, and it's not actually the extension's fault.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.300
That's why this is particularly tricky.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.300
Wow.

03:58.300 --> 03:59.300
This is interesting.

03:59.300 --> 04:03.160
It's just simply an issue in Linux when you have that many open files, and when you're

04:03.160 --> 04:06.860
catting a bunch, a bunch, a bunch of things in proc, at the same time you've got a game

04:06.860 --> 04:11.440
accessing all of its image data and its sound files and all that stuff, you sometimes get

04:11.440 --> 04:12.720
an I.O. stutter like that.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.480
It's just like a problem right now.

04:14.480 --> 04:18.320
And they talk about it here in this thread, and they talk about ways you could alleviate

04:18.320 --> 04:24.080
the problem by making the extension more efficient, and other ways to sort of coalesce some of

04:24.080 --> 04:25.560
the polling and things like that.

04:25.560 --> 04:31.320
So I just did a grand purge of extensions that checked my CPU temps and my GPU temps.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.320
Anything with lots of random access.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.320
Yeah, I just did a purge.

04:33.320 --> 04:36.720
I did a purge, and it has been totally smooth, but it totally interrupted my gameplay.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.760
So I didn't get a chance to jump on the server last week.

04:39.760 --> 04:40.760
There you go.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.240
That is my story of a Gnome extension that turned out...

04:43.240 --> 04:44.240
That's good to know.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.800
It's gone through exactly the same turmoil as you did.

04:45.800 --> 04:49.680
Such a rabbit hole, because you start with all the obvious things like, oh, it's freaking

04:49.680 --> 04:54.240
open source graphics, or oh, it's freaking power management, or it's my new Arch kernel.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.920
And you're so used to those icons up there, you don't even think about it.

04:56.920 --> 05:00.840
Yeah, and I've always had system monitor extensions, literally, for ever.

05:00.840 --> 05:06.080
Because I'm often compiling, or not compiling often, but when I'm re-upting my AUR packages,

05:06.080 --> 05:09.200
I like to watch how busy my system is so I know I can do a bunch of other stuff.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.880
Or definitely when I'm encoding video, it's extremely handy to have that.

05:12.880 --> 05:17.240
So it's, yeah, it was a little embarrassing, and I had to share it with you.

05:17.240 --> 05:20.200
And you might want to look into it too, if you have the Gnome system monitor extension,

05:20.200 --> 05:24.040
which is kind of a popular one, or any of those that pull your system a lot for what's

05:24.040 --> 05:27.720
going on, maybe try turning them off for a little while and see if you notice a difference.

05:27.720 --> 05:30.860
That's my lesson.

05:30.860 --> 05:43.400
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 156 for August 2nd, 2016.

05:43.400 --> 05:51.760
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that was almost running a little

05:51.760 --> 05:52.760
late.

05:52.760 --> 05:57.200
Because even though it rained so damn much, people still don't let it dry very well.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.480
This is something where Linux will save us all one day.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.160
Linux will be in the cars driving us.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.160
You know it.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.600
And us meat sacks will be busy playing on our phones.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.600
That's what I think.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.200
But that's not what we're here to talk about on today's episode of the Unplugged program.

06:09.200 --> 06:12.360
We have a huge, huge fun show to get into.

06:12.360 --> 06:16.240
A bunch of really great news has propped up just in the last couple of days from some

06:16.240 --> 06:17.560
of our favorite open source projects.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.400
So we're going to spend a bunch of time at the top of the show digging through some of

06:20.400 --> 06:21.960
those really good stuff there.

06:21.960 --> 06:28.120
New version of Mint X F C E is out, and there's some really interesting news in there.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.960
And also, really interesting language and positioning by Clem.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.880
We'll talk a little bit about that in the show.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.280
Then the Googs has the Chromecast.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.960
You guys all know about the Chromecast.

06:38.960 --> 06:45.200
It's sold like hotcakes, but it's really reliant on Google services.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.400
That's got to be its Achilles heel.

06:47.400 --> 06:52.080
This week, we'll talk about ways you can use the Chromecast with tools on your Linux box

06:52.080 --> 06:53.560
to stream to a Chromecast locally.

06:53.560 --> 06:57.360
So you can go pick yourself up one of these cheap streaming little devices.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.840
We'll also talk about some open source alternatives to Chromecast, get the Mumble Rooms tips and

07:01.840 --> 07:03.560
all of that.

07:03.560 --> 07:07.960
Then we're going to transition into some of the Kodi exploits I've been doing.

07:07.960 --> 07:12.240
And by that, I mean adventures in figuring out how to name my files, some of the cool

07:12.240 --> 07:15.240
add-ons and extensions I've found, of course.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.400
In-depth experience here.

07:16.400 --> 07:20.960
And also a tool to help whip my media collection into shape, and I know we'll get some great

07:20.960 --> 07:26.080
advice from that virtual lug, too, on making a really great Kodi installation.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.040
I am really looking forward to what they have to say there.

07:28.040 --> 07:32.760
Plus, we'll talk about some alternative backends that the community has been talking to me

07:32.760 --> 07:35.240
about since I've been talking more about Kodi recently.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.360
And they look really cool.

07:36.360 --> 07:41.760
Some really neat stuff you can do, even if you're not a home theater person or a Kodi

07:41.760 --> 07:43.580
or Plex or MB person.

07:43.580 --> 07:47.400
What we're going to talk about and how these open source projects can interact is absolutely

07:47.400 --> 07:48.400
fascinating.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.880
So there's just a ton of stuff there.

07:50.880 --> 07:55.660
So to help us get through all of it, and I mean there is a lot of it, let's bring in

07:55.660 --> 07:56.660
that virtual lug.

07:56.660 --> 07:57.660
Time appropriate greetings, mother room.

07:57.660 --> 07:58.660
Greetings, folks.

07:58.660 --> 07:59.660
Hello.

07:59.660 --> 08:00.660
Hello.

08:00.660 --> 08:01.660
Hello.

08:01.660 --> 08:02.660
Hello.

08:02.660 --> 08:03.660
I secretly use Arch Linux.

08:03.660 --> 08:04.660
No, that's fine.

08:04.660 --> 08:05.660
Poppy, you don't need to...

08:05.660 --> 08:06.660
All right.

08:06.660 --> 08:15.160
So anyways, I wanted to start with something that proves a prediction that virtual lugger

08:15.160 --> 08:22.480
Daredevil made months ago when Microsoft announced Ubuntu runtime for Windows, whatever they

08:22.480 --> 08:26.160
call that monstrosity.

08:26.160 --> 08:30.580
This he said, and I think he's right, Linux is going to become the new default platform

08:30.580 --> 08:32.320
that you write applications for.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.760
And check out this first story we're going to talk about.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.080
So there's a lot of Docker news this week.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.760
We won't bore you to tears with all of the news, but I'll tell you just a couple of things.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.120
First of all, we're going to start with this post about bringing Linux apps to the Mac

08:43.120 --> 08:45.760
desktop using freaking Docker.

08:45.760 --> 08:46.760
Why?

08:46.760 --> 08:52.040
Well, to access newer versions of software because it usually takes a while for Mac people

08:52.040 --> 08:54.320
to get to our second hand ports.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.600
I can think of a few, like there's some Linux games I like to play where you can install

08:57.600 --> 09:01.560
them on Mac, but a lot of Mac users might not have Xcode installed, all the things you

09:01.560 --> 09:02.560
need to build it.

09:02.560 --> 09:06.280
Whereas Linux, I can be like, here, run this script in a Docker and bam, done.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.280
Right.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.100
To test versions simultaneously, multiple different versions simultaneously, to use

09:10.100 --> 09:14.680
tools that have been ported over to the Mac, and for sandboxing applications.

09:14.680 --> 09:19.680
So this is really kind of an intense walkthrough of how to get...

09:19.680 --> 09:24.320
Docker is an example of a GTK Slack app to get all these different apps that are Linux

09:24.320 --> 09:27.380
applications running on top of the Mac.

09:27.380 --> 09:32.780
And sort of along with this today, Docker has announced that they now consider Mac Docker

09:32.780 --> 09:38.120
version production ready, like it's officially been stamped as you can now use Docker on

09:38.120 --> 09:39.120
the Mac in production.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.280
What do you think about all this?

09:42.280 --> 09:43.520
You know, it is interesting.

09:43.520 --> 09:47.480
It does, I think it really does speak to what Daredevilin said about the Linux runtime being

09:47.480 --> 09:48.480
everywhere.

09:48.480 --> 09:57.000
Yeah, it kind of worries me a little bit.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.520
Because I'm still not...

09:58.520 --> 10:06.540
I haven't seen a container ecosystem where things are being smoothly and routinely updated

10:06.540 --> 10:11.400
and things are being patched when there's security exploits.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.680
And I'm worried that what we...

10:12.680 --> 10:15.840
You know, one of the big things that scares me about the internet of things, quote unquote,

10:15.840 --> 10:19.600
I hate that term so much, but it's just there's so many terms I hate now that I just figured

10:19.600 --> 10:21.080
like I gotta roll with it.

10:21.080 --> 10:24.560
Like I can't hate cloud for the rest of my life or derp learning, you know.

10:24.560 --> 10:29.220
But internet of things devices, what's the big security issue in your mind about internet

10:29.220 --> 10:31.040
of things devices?

10:31.040 --> 10:32.760
Well they never get patched.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.000
Exactly.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.480
And now we're doing the same exact thing in containers.

10:36.480 --> 10:41.240
We're just loading our secure Linux boxes up with containers that never get patched.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.040
Now that's not universally the case.

10:44.040 --> 10:48.640
But it's easy enough that you've pulled that one Docker file one time and it runs and you've

10:48.640 --> 10:50.400
never done anything else.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.400
Exactly.

10:51.400 --> 10:56.040
The handfuls of Docker images that I have done, that tends to be the case for me.

10:56.040 --> 10:59.760
And even if I'm willing to stay up to date on them, it's not always easy because sometimes

10:59.760 --> 11:02.360
you can lose data if you screw things up because...

11:02.360 --> 11:04.960
And also sometimes they just simply don't update them.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.800
That's another problem.

11:06.800 --> 11:12.920
So this is sort of potentially leading us down a path that two, three years from now

11:12.920 --> 11:15.680
could leave a lot of people in a bad situation.

11:15.680 --> 11:20.080
We're going to wish there was some sort of shared common run time among all these or

11:20.080 --> 11:21.080
something.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.320
But hopefully the increased prevalence on other platforms will contribute to an incentive

11:24.320 --> 11:25.320
for that.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.320
Yeah, I suppose so.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.320
It doesn't have to be that way.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.320
Boy, that is a silver lining.

11:28.320 --> 11:32.880
I do wonder if there's any work going on to integrate with that Windows, the new Windows

11:32.880 --> 11:33.880
layer.

11:33.880 --> 11:39.280
I think right now they're using Hyper-V and they're using XHive on the Mac, but I wonder

11:39.280 --> 11:41.640
if they'll be able to do a little bit closer binding.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.600
I don't know, that's weird.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.800
I don't even get me started on containers that use virtualization because that just

11:46.800 --> 11:50.200
sounds like a VM to me, but I digress.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.160
This next story, I think a lot of people are going to be excited about it.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.200
I know Noah and I have talked about this quite a bit.

11:55.200 --> 11:59.880
I'm not sure where you weigh in, but folks like Popey, don't worry about this.

11:59.880 --> 12:00.880
Look at this.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.440
Popey tweeted this today.

12:02.440 --> 12:08.620
He's taking apart a NETGEAR GS116 switch and getting a soldering iron out to fix this thing.

12:08.620 --> 12:15.340
But for those of us who want to buy new routers and run open source firmwares, TP-Link might

12:15.340 --> 12:19.800
be back on the list of possible devices that will run Linux.

12:19.800 --> 12:25.840
This is after a FCC ruling that's going to force TP-Link to allow open source firmwares

12:25.840 --> 12:26.840
on the...

12:26.840 --> 12:27.840
I did not expect this.

12:27.840 --> 12:28.840
Yeah.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.800
They're also going to pay a $200,000 fine, so that's really kind of something.

12:31.800 --> 12:35.600
The TP-Link settlement was announced in the midst of controversy spurred by those new

12:35.600 --> 12:37.560
FCC rules we've talked about in the past.

12:37.560 --> 12:43.560
The new rules for the 5 gigahertz band require router makers to prevent third party firmwares

12:43.560 --> 12:47.800
from changing the radio frequency parameters, i.e. letting you blast it up and stuff like

12:47.800 --> 12:51.080
that, because they're worried you're going to mess with Doppler radar, I guess.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.080
That sounds legit to me.

12:52.080 --> 12:58.080
TP-Link didn't break any rules by blocking third party firmwares, but it got attention

12:58.080 --> 13:02.760
from the FCC's enforcement bureau by selling routers that made it possible for users, once

13:02.760 --> 13:06.940
they load those firmwares, to circumvent power limits.

13:06.940 --> 13:10.880
Other manufacturers that came up with ways to... Links just worked with Marvell and

13:10.880 --> 13:13.960
others to allow open source firmwares, but not allow the firmwares to tweak the radio

13:13.960 --> 13:14.960
transmitting.

13:14.960 --> 13:15.960
Right.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.600
Here's the thing that I kind of feel a little icky about.

13:18.600 --> 13:22.760
After admitting the violation, TP-Link halted sales of the offending devices.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.760
That makes sense, right?

13:23.760 --> 13:24.760
Right.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.760
Yep.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.160
But then they issued a software update so that units already sold to consumers would

13:28.160 --> 13:29.160
comply.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.160
So they just...

13:30.160 --> 13:31.160
Oh, yeah.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.160
That is a little...

13:32.160 --> 13:33.160
That's a major feature.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.840
If I could control the radio power... I'm way out in the fricking boondocks, dude, right?

13:35.840 --> 13:40.840
If I could control the radio frequency powers and maybe get a little more signal, that would

13:40.840 --> 13:42.400
be the main thing I would want that for.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.960
So that'd be a huge bummer.

13:43.960 --> 13:49.520
And it's interesting because TP-Link's violation related to 2.4 gigahertz band, but their software

13:49.520 --> 13:53.440
update also precludes customers from installing third party software, including open source

13:53.440 --> 13:55.560
software, to meet the new five gigahertz requirement.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.100
And that's kind of where they got in trouble.

13:59.100 --> 14:02.800
It's interesting that getting in trouble for that has then led to a settlement where they're

14:02.800 --> 14:05.360
required to keep working with open source.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.360
Yeah, very much so.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.680
I really like that development.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.680
That's great.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.680
Yeah.

14:09.680 --> 14:10.680
So...

14:10.680 --> 14:15.760
And hopefully they can just figure it out on the hardware level and just... Before,

14:15.760 --> 14:16.760
I think people loved TP-Links.

14:16.760 --> 14:20.320
A lot of people were using them because they had great support for OpenWRT and such.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.320
Yep.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.320
That's why I bought one in the past.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.320
Also, just kind of a separate thing.

14:23.320 --> 14:31.280
Imagination Technologies, which is a chip maker, is working with OpenWRT and others to put

14:31.280 --> 14:36.600
the OpenWRT software into a virtual machine on these devices, which would be isolated

14:36.600 --> 14:37.600
from the radio controls.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.600
Now, I don't really know if I like that a lot, because what would be the host OS?

14:40.600 --> 14:42.080
Is it something super base?

14:42.080 --> 14:43.080
Or is it their crappy firmware?

14:43.080 --> 14:44.080
Right.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.080
Is it like a very minimal hypervisor?

14:45.080 --> 14:46.080
Yeah.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.080
Yeah.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.080
What is that?

14:48.080 --> 14:49.080
And is it safe and secure?

14:49.080 --> 14:51.820
But that is an interesting approach, and then you can run whichever open source firmware

14:51.820 --> 14:55.720
you want in a VM, and I would think the upgrades on that are going to be pretty rock solid

14:55.720 --> 14:58.440
because it's virtualized hardware, so it's not like that's a moving target.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.440
Right.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.440
Exactly.

15:00.440 --> 15:01.440
So that's pretty cool.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.960
You guys can check out more in the show notes.

15:03.960 --> 15:09.120
So Wes, you found a pretty cool project that we wanted to share with the audience this

15:09.120 --> 15:13.840
week, and this is so perfect for somebody like me who's often trying to figure out ways

15:13.840 --> 15:18.480
to not use mobile data because it's like a personal challenge of mine.

15:18.480 --> 15:19.480
Right.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.480
Totally.

15:20.480 --> 15:24.820
And when you hear of tethering, you always hear about connecting your laptop to your

15:24.820 --> 15:26.280
phone's internet connection.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.280
Exactly.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.280
That's the common use case.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.280
That's the common use case.

15:29.280 --> 15:35.360
So what if my freaking laptop or desktop is plugged into a nice, solid ethernet connection

15:35.360 --> 15:38.680
and I got a big update or something like that I want to do on my phone?

15:38.680 --> 15:45.720
Wes, here is Simple RT, simple reverse tethering for Android.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.000
So this is exactly that.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.200
It allows you to share your computer's internet connection with your Android device via a

15:52.200 --> 15:54.280
USB cable.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.520
Linux and OS X, it says, are supported.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.520
Windows is not and unlikely to be in the future.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.520
Understandable.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.080
So you've got to plug it in right now.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.080
Is it working?

16:03.080 --> 16:04.080
Does it work?

16:04.080 --> 16:05.080
It does work.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.080
Let's see.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.400
So it must be two pieces, an app on the phone, right?

16:07.400 --> 16:08.400
Yep.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.400
Right.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.480
And then there's software on your laptop.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.480
Here we go.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.480
Okay.

16:13.480 --> 16:14.480
Connect.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.480
Requires Android 4.0 or higher.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.640
And did you have to, was there packages?

16:18.640 --> 16:19.800
Did you have to build something?

16:19.800 --> 16:20.800
What was that like?

16:20.800 --> 16:24.400
They have a pre-built APK, so I downloaded that on the phone and installed it.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.820
And then it doesn't install an app or anything, it all just runs in the background.

16:27.820 --> 16:32.040
And then on your, so you don't need root on the phone, but you do need root on the computer

16:32.040 --> 16:33.480
that you're using.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.280
Then you would download from GitHub, they have a thing.

16:35.280 --> 16:40.000
You need to install lib USB, but that's the only thing I needed.

16:40.000 --> 16:46.440
A simple make, and then it spits out, it binds to the USB so that you use sudo, you run dot

16:46.440 --> 16:49.400
slash simple RT, and then it waits for you to plug your phone in.

16:49.400 --> 16:53.560
You plug your phone in, and then that triggers the app, which starts a custom VPN, like through

16:53.560 --> 16:55.200
the Android VPN interface.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.200
Oh, smart.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.200
Yeah, it seems to work.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.200
I'm actually pretty impressed with that.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.640
And it, you know, I tested it earlier at work, and I was able to-

17:00.640 --> 17:01.680
Have you done a speed test?

17:01.680 --> 17:03.600
I have not done a speed test yet, but that's a good question.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.760
Do you have the speed test app on there by chance, because that would be, that'd be really

17:06.760 --> 17:10.920
interesting to know that, because you should be pretty much getting whatever our WiFi could

17:10.920 --> 17:11.920
deliver your, well, of course-

17:11.920 --> 17:14.120
This might be USB 2, though, here.

17:14.120 --> 17:18.600
Yeah, yeah, that would be the limiting factor, but even still, that would be pretty interesting.

17:18.600 --> 17:20.240
Yeah, so that's really cool.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.240
So again, it's called simple RT.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.680
I was really pleased with the Android integration.

17:23.680 --> 17:27.060
I've done a little bit of this with IP tables and a root terminal on my phone, but it's

17:27.060 --> 17:30.400
all very hacky, and this is, it's not quite all the way polished.

17:30.400 --> 17:34.280
Like if you have a lot of custom DNS, for instance, if you're trying to get your phone

17:34.280 --> 17:38.640
onto a VPN through an Ethernet connection only or something like that, then I think

17:38.640 --> 17:44.040
there could be some stuff improved, like maybe how some of the AP scripts set up DNS masks

17:44.040 --> 17:45.040
for you.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.560
I think something like that might go a long way, but it's already very nice.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.560
Huh.

17:48.560 --> 17:53.520
Yeah, Android N, not too far, I mean, Ham was saying it's three days away, actually.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.400
Then that would be, that might be a way to get that download.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.640
I mean, of course, you'd probably be on WiFi in most cases, but if for some weird reason

17:59.640 --> 18:03.760
you don't have WiFi, but you have the machine you're sitting at has internet access still,

18:03.760 --> 18:06.260
this could be a way to, or doing a whole bunch of Android app updates, or-

18:06.260 --> 18:08.840
Or maybe you're like in a place where you only have Ethernet, but you really want to

18:08.840 --> 18:10.040
make a phone call.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.840
Or hell, even syncing down your Spotify music.

18:11.840 --> 18:12.840
Yeah.

18:12.840 --> 18:15.760
That could be a way faster way to do that, because I like to do the extreme quality.

18:15.760 --> 18:16.760
So yeah.

18:16.760 --> 18:20.040
And then you're doing this, by the way, on a Nexus 5 running Marshmallow?

18:20.040 --> 18:21.040
Yes.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.040
Okay.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.600
So it works on anything 4.0 all the way up to Marshmallow.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.600
Yeah.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.600
That's great.

18:25.600 --> 18:26.600
That's a huge range of devices.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.600
It was really easy to get going.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
Huh.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.600
Yeah, this is right up my alley.

18:29.600 --> 18:33.240
This is right up my alley, because I'm constantly gaming the system when it comes to mobile.

18:33.240 --> 18:37.280
Yeah, and you never quite know when you might want that, you know, and so it can just be

18:37.280 --> 18:38.280
very helpful.

18:38.280 --> 18:41.040
Or maybe you're on a wired network, but you really want to use the cast from your phone

18:41.040 --> 18:43.920
for a specific thing on your phone that you can't do on Linux.

18:43.920 --> 18:50.160
And you know what I just remembered is I have had mobile phones, one, that the Wi-Fi chip

18:50.160 --> 18:51.800
died on it.

18:51.800 --> 18:55.080
And so the only thing you could use was the network, the cellular network.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.080
Right.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.080
So there you are paying for that data.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.080
That's no good.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.080
That's no good.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.080
So this kind of thing would be perfect for that.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.080
That would be perfect.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.080
Huh.

19:02.080 --> 19:07.200
Simple RT, not for retweet, but for reverse tether for Android 4.0 or higher.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.160
You know, while we're talking about mobile, this is probably a great time to mention

19:10.160 --> 19:11.160
Ting.

19:11.160 --> 19:14.240
Ting is my mobile service provider, and I really enjoy using Ting because it's only

19:14.240 --> 19:16.160
pay for what you use mobile.

19:16.160 --> 19:20.560
And because like I know of things like Simple RT, but really, you know, I have Wi-Fi at

19:20.560 --> 19:21.560
work.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.560
I have Wi-Fi at home.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.720
I have Wi-Fi at families, houses that I go to.

19:24.720 --> 19:30.120
I find that to be really all I need to just keep my bill down to an absolute bare minimum

19:30.120 --> 19:33.240
for three devices talking 35, 40 bucks.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.240
And that's, you know.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.240
That's crazy.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.240
That's with three people using their phones.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.340
And of course, Rekai again, Rekai, same thing, on Wi-Fi all the time.

19:39.340 --> 19:42.080
So it's basically like his line is almost free for us.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.080
It's $6 just for the line, and then your usage on top of that.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.080
There's no contract.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.520
There's no determination fee.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.520
It's pay for what you use wireless.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.520
See, that's right there.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.240
Like, it's a sell plan for adults.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.360
You know, there's not a lot of rules.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.360
There's no gimmicks.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.360
You don't have to worry about some arbitrary Linux.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.920
No pink shirt and leather jacket required.

19:56.920 --> 19:57.920
Yeah.

19:57.920 --> 19:58.920
They know that you use what you want.

19:58.920 --> 19:59.920
You pay for it.

19:59.920 --> 20:00.920
It's very simple.

20:00.920 --> 20:01.920
It is.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.400
And you can get started right now by going to linux.ting.com to support this show and

20:04.400 --> 20:07.320
get a $25 discount off your first device.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.760
Or if you're going to bring a device and they have a CDMA and GSM network you can pick from,

20:10.760 --> 20:14.320
which is really cool, they'll give you that in credit in service.

20:14.320 --> 20:18.160
And since your monthly bill on average can be like $23 for a line, that'll pay for more

20:18.160 --> 20:19.160
than your first month.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.640
They have really great customer service.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.840
I mean, this is like a cornerstone aspect of Ting.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.180
And they have a super nice dashboard as well.

20:26.180 --> 20:27.180
You can check it all out.

20:27.180 --> 20:31.160
They give you great controls from your phone, on the web.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.840
I love their blog as well.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.440
They've just recently done a post about the Ting pricing promise.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.440
Check that out.

20:36.440 --> 20:37.840
Just start by going to linux.ting.com.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.960
They have great cord cutting info over there.

20:40.960 --> 20:45.980
They have also extra storage, how to hook up extra storage to your device blog post.

20:45.980 --> 20:46.980
Really good ones over there.

20:46.980 --> 20:47.980
Check them out.

20:47.980 --> 20:48.980
Linux.ting.com.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.800
My mobile service provider for well over two years.

20:50.800 --> 20:54.560
If you want to take the test and just see if it might work for you, go over to the what

20:54.560 --> 20:57.880
would you save buttons right there on the front page when you visit linux.ting.com.

20:57.880 --> 20:58.880
Plug in your information.

20:58.880 --> 20:59.880
They make it really easy.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.880
You can see how it works.

21:01.880 --> 21:02.880
Linux.ting.com.

21:02.880 --> 21:03.880
Thanks Ting.

21:03.880 --> 21:04.880
All right.

21:04.880 --> 21:09.680
So this next story is a quick mention because I've seen some people talking about it in

21:09.680 --> 21:10.680
the chat room today.

21:10.680 --> 21:14.600
And I want to give people a heads up because I don't know, I didn't see when this ends.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.200
Oh, oh, they're accepting entries until the 14th.

21:17.200 --> 21:21.200
So we will have time to talk about it in the last, but today System76 announced they're

21:21.200 --> 21:22.200
giving a laptop away.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.320
Hey, those are nice laptops.

21:25.320 --> 21:29.600
They're doing, they're giving away a Lemure, which is a pretty popular laptop over at System76.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.360
It's going to be preloaded with Ubuntu.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.360
14 inch.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.500
They're just giving it away.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.480
They're going to do a, yeah, you got it.

21:35.480 --> 21:36.480
There's a little bit of effort though.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.640
So you have to go read the post in the show notes to find out more.

21:38.640 --> 21:44.400
But it's going to be a 14.1 inch screen with a six generation core i3 processor, four gigs

21:44.400 --> 21:48.840
of RAM and a 500 gigabyte hard drive and an Intel dual band wireless AC card.

21:48.840 --> 21:49.840
Sweet.

21:49.840 --> 21:50.840
Yersh.

21:50.840 --> 21:51.840
That would be a nice laptop to give for free.

21:51.840 --> 21:52.840
And you know it runs great with Linux.

21:52.840 --> 21:53.840
Yeah.

21:53.840 --> 21:54.840
So that's really cool.

21:54.840 --> 21:55.840
You can check that out.

21:55.840 --> 21:56.840
It runs Ubuntu.

21:56.840 --> 21:57.840
Ubuntu?

21:57.840 --> 21:58.840
Ubuntu?

21:58.840 --> 21:59.840
I don't know.

21:59.840 --> 22:00.840
I use Linux Mint.

22:00.840 --> 22:06.320
Linux Mint XFCE Sara has been released and it's a big release because it's going to be

22:06.320 --> 22:07.800
supported until 2021.

22:07.800 --> 22:13.560
If you think about it, if you're an XFCE user, you probably don't, you probably don't like

22:13.560 --> 22:15.380
reloading your system a lot.

22:15.380 --> 22:19.400
So being able to install something that is a first class XFCE implementation that is

22:19.400 --> 22:22.320
supported until 2021, that is damn attractive.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.320
Yeah.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.320
Yeah.

22:24.320 --> 22:27.040
Think of a lot of like, you know, workshop machines where you just want a nice little

22:27.040 --> 22:28.040
desktop.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.040
Yep.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.040
That just runs for ages.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.040
Yeah.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.040
Yeah.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.040
And that would be, I mean, geez, that's great.

22:33.040 --> 22:36.520
So here's a couple of new things in XFCE Sara edition.

22:36.520 --> 22:39.960
I wanted to quickly mention, he talks a lot, Clem does in his post, he talks a lot about

22:39.960 --> 22:40.960
XApps.

22:40.960 --> 22:45.440
And remember those XApps is this new project to produce generic applications for GTK desktop

22:45.440 --> 22:47.400
environments, Forks and et cetera.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.500
And he talks about Zed and XViewer and a bunch of the different ones in here.

22:50.500 --> 22:54.200
But he makes a comment down here that I thought was interesting and it sort of reflects his

22:54.200 --> 22:56.320
attitude about this, which I found refreshing.

22:56.320 --> 23:03.560
He says, note that the GNOME apps and MATEI apps and XFCE apps and that these XApps replace

23:03.560 --> 23:05.680
are still available in the repositories.

23:05.680 --> 23:09.980
You can install them side to side with XApps to compare them to decide which ones you like

23:09.980 --> 23:10.980
best.

23:10.980 --> 23:16.240
XApps do integrate better, however, with your environment, not only in obvious ways with

23:16.240 --> 23:20.100
traditional interfaces, but also in the way they support desktop environments.

23:20.100 --> 23:22.680
But I do like that he says, you know, you can install them side by side and see which

23:22.680 --> 23:23.680
ones you like better.

23:23.680 --> 23:24.680
Yeah.

23:24.680 --> 23:25.680
That's a good attitude.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.680
You're using a ton of applications and suggesting your users use them.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.240
Which hopefully means like, yeah, they're going to try to compete on their merit, right?

23:31.240 --> 23:33.840
So if they are better than people, people will use them.

23:33.840 --> 23:34.840
Yeah.

23:34.840 --> 23:35.840
Yeah.

23:35.840 --> 23:36.840
So I thought that was, I thought that was kind of nice.

23:36.840 --> 23:41.720
Anybody in the mumble room an XFCE user by chance?

23:41.720 --> 23:43.920
I find that surprising.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.200
I find that really surprising.

23:45.200 --> 23:51.080
I used to use it when I first tried Arch on a machine, but it doesn't do what I want to

23:51.080 --> 23:54.360
do because I want to, I don't want things really simplified.

23:54.360 --> 23:58.160
I want things more complex and tweakable like KDE.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.440
So I just no longer use it.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.960
I used it for quite a long time after the very first release of Unity and I was still

24:04.960 --> 24:05.960
in Ubuntu.

24:05.960 --> 24:06.960
Me too.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.840
I switched over to XFCE and I mean, at the time I think it was in school, so I didn't

24:08.840 --> 24:12.760
have a lot of time for customization and it was, I mean, it still is a fine desktop if

24:12.760 --> 24:13.760
that's all you need.

24:13.760 --> 24:14.760
Yeah.

24:14.760 --> 24:19.820
I feel like after I looked at this release here, I thought maybe I should seriously consider

24:19.820 --> 24:22.280
the XFCE again for my workhorse machines.

24:22.280 --> 24:23.280
I love Gnome 3.

24:23.280 --> 24:26.600
I have no complaints, but you know, like I had that weird extension issue right into

24:26.600 --> 24:27.600
that.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.600
Yeah.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.800
And I just simply need this thing to just work every single time.

24:30.800 --> 24:31.840
Not that it isn't now.

24:31.840 --> 24:32.840
So I don't really have any issues now.

24:32.840 --> 24:33.840
Right.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.920
There's no incentive, but it is certainly a stable platform.

24:35.920 --> 24:41.480
But that just thinking, like it just feels like it would be a rock, but yeah.

24:41.480 --> 24:46.600
Still a Raspbian user if that counts for, you know, XFCE.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.600
That's true.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.600
That's true.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.600
Yeah.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.600
I guess maybe...

24:50.600 --> 24:51.600
So the Raspbian user likes DE.

24:51.600 --> 24:52.600
Yeah.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
Yeah.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.120
I guess maybe that's what it is too, is there's just less excitement on XFCE these days.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.160
I think that's a big part of it.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.160
Yeah.

24:59.160 --> 25:00.160
That's true.

25:00.160 --> 25:01.160
Yeah.

25:01.160 --> 25:04.600
There's also a great Manjaro spin with an XFCE desktop.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.880
Now I enjoyed on my last road trip, Gnome maps a lot.

25:08.880 --> 25:09.880
I thought having...

25:09.880 --> 25:16.400
I went from why is Gnome wasting time making a mapping application to, oh, this is why

25:16.400 --> 25:20.360
Gnome's making a map because it's so nice to actually have it in a native desktop application.

25:20.360 --> 25:21.360
Totally.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.360
Totally.

25:22.360 --> 25:23.360
Yeah.

25:23.360 --> 25:24.360
I hate the web browser.

25:24.360 --> 25:25.840
Waiting for the DOM to up to edge just the web.

25:25.840 --> 25:26.840
Nobody needs that.

25:26.840 --> 25:27.840
Nope.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.600
And plus, I can be doing my search end and looking up stuff in one window and I can be

25:30.600 --> 25:32.780
doing my mapping in my Gnome maps.

25:32.780 --> 25:38.440
And I was thrilled to have that along with Fedora 24 on my last road trip.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.520
Then almost the day after I got back...

25:40.520 --> 25:42.020
It really was terrible timing.

25:42.020 --> 25:47.120
The map quest API got pulled underneath them, from underneath them, and Gnome maps just

25:47.120 --> 25:49.760
started displaying developer tiles.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.360
It was kind of embarrassing actually.

25:51.360 --> 25:55.920
It looked awful and Ubuntu Gnome announced they'd be dropping Gnome maps and it just...

25:55.920 --> 25:57.760
It felt like what was maps gonna do, right?

25:57.760 --> 25:58.760
Yeah.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.160
Here we had this nice application and just...

26:00.160 --> 26:01.160
Real shame.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.160
Just a real shame.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.160
Well, guess what?

26:03.160 --> 26:04.160
We got good news here, Wes.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.640
Good, good news.

26:05.640 --> 26:09.920
Things are back up and looking better with 3.20.4 release.

26:09.920 --> 26:14.200
They're switching away from map quest, open API for fetching tiles, and instead they're

26:14.200 --> 26:16.720
gonna start using Mapbox's API.

26:16.720 --> 26:22.400
They're using a community API key from Mapbox and Mapbox is a company they say with a commitment

26:22.400 --> 26:26.480
to open source and provides infrastructure that will allow us to do more with maps.

26:26.480 --> 26:34.320
We're accessing the Mapbox API through a Gnome proxy that will allow us to easily switch

26:34.320 --> 26:36.560
our tile provider in the future.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.560
See, that's the way to do it.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.560
A little extraction there.

26:38.560 --> 26:39.560
Also watch everywhere you go.

26:39.560 --> 26:40.560
What?

26:40.560 --> 26:41.560
Yeah, well, I mean, yeah.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.560
So there you go.

26:42.560 --> 26:46.080
Are you saying you didn't want to tell Gnome where you are anyway, Chris?

26:46.080 --> 26:49.200
You know what I would like to see Gnome Maps do?

26:49.200 --> 26:52.240
You know the direction I would like to take this?

26:52.240 --> 26:55.880
Imagine Gnome Maps allowing me to configure my own backend so I could point it at like

26:55.880 --> 26:59.120
OpenStreetMaps or something or my own hosted mapping server.

26:59.120 --> 27:01.840
Just the wrapper around a compatible map API.

27:01.840 --> 27:06.840
Yeah, so if it was Canonical, if Canonical had announced that they were shipping a mapping

27:06.840 --> 27:14.600
application on Ubuntu Touch that used a proxy, a proxy everywhere you go, wouldn't that be

27:14.600 --> 27:16.160
a huge controversy?

27:16.160 --> 27:20.080
A proxy to some, you know, somewhat proprietary service.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.480
Yeah, exactly.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.480
Exactly.

27:22.480 --> 27:27.920
When they did that with Unity Dash Launcher, like we lost our collective S over that.

27:27.920 --> 27:31.640
Now the Gnome camp goes, yeah, we're going to be proxying all of your map requests through

27:31.640 --> 27:34.600
a central proxy run by us, but don't worry about it.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
It's fine.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.600
And we're like, okay, cool.

27:36.600 --> 27:37.600
Good idea.

27:37.600 --> 27:38.600
That's good.

27:38.600 --> 27:39.600
Thank you for planning for the future, guys.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.840
I wonder how that proxy is set up.

27:42.840 --> 27:48.120
I mean, would it be different if it's a Chef configured server and you can see the Chef

27:48.120 --> 27:49.120
recipes right there?

27:49.120 --> 27:50.120
Sure, sure.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.120
That's a good idea.

27:51.120 --> 27:54.520
I mean, you can't actually verify what's on the box, but it's a little bit more transparency.

27:54.520 --> 27:55.520
Hmm.

27:55.520 --> 27:58.800
NorthRanger, you got a little conspiracy bacon there.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.640
Why don't you share it with the class?

28:01.640 --> 28:08.120
I guess I trust Gnome more to run a proxy that could potentially snoop on my location

28:08.120 --> 28:15.920
than both an app, a game developer and Google farming out hundreds of millions of users

28:15.920 --> 28:20.080
with Pokemon having their location shared, basically.

28:20.080 --> 28:26.120
But isn't the issue not about Pokemon and Diantic and all these people, but more people

28:26.120 --> 28:31.480
losing their minds on results from Amazon, even though they're going through a proxy

28:31.480 --> 28:34.320
with Canonical?

28:34.320 --> 28:37.700
I think it was both.

28:37.700 --> 28:42.080
They were saying that Amazon was tracking you and all this other stuff and they're letting

28:42.080 --> 28:45.360
... No, they weren't, because the data never went to Amazon.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.320
It went to Ubuntu first.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.320
Yeah.

28:48.320 --> 28:51.000
There could be a flip side of that.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
I remember the first question that was asked after Canonical announced the built-in search

28:55.000 --> 28:56.800
was, is it going to be HTTPS?

28:56.800 --> 28:58.160
And the answer was no.

28:58.160 --> 29:00.760
Is this Gnome maps proxy HTTPS?

29:00.760 --> 29:03.920
Why are we not asking the same questions?

29:03.920 --> 29:04.920
Why is that?

29:04.920 --> 29:05.920
Why is that a thing?

29:05.920 --> 29:06.920
Right.

29:06.920 --> 29:10.160
I'm not saying that Gnome Project is doing anything wrong, and I agree with North Ranger.

29:10.160 --> 29:15.640
I trust them 100% implicitly more than I trust Google or Niantic.

29:15.640 --> 29:16.640
But you're right.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.660
We should have a set of standards for how we think maps or other personal sharing services

29:20.660 --> 29:23.320
like that should be run.

29:23.320 --> 29:28.140
Is this crazy to say that we need a constitution for hosted services and in the constitution

29:28.140 --> 29:35.160
it says if we host something that tracks you or knows where you're at at all times, we

29:35.160 --> 29:37.320
will make sure that it's set up and protected in these ways?

29:37.320 --> 29:41.520
I mean that feels like something that should just be – whenever I'm making the choice

29:41.520 --> 29:42.520
to either self-host or –

29:42.520 --> 29:44.920
Like a privacy pledge for hosted services.

29:44.920 --> 29:45.920
That's a better term.

29:45.920 --> 29:46.920
Yeah.

29:46.920 --> 29:47.920
A privacy pledge.

29:47.920 --> 29:48.920
That's better.

29:48.920 --> 29:49.920
Yeah.

29:49.920 --> 29:50.920
Because it feels – yeah, exactly.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.080
Because it feels like if I'm making the conscious decision to self-host versus use

29:52.080 --> 29:53.080
a hosted service –

29:53.080 --> 29:57.200
A lot of times it comes down to like control of your data and knowledge about where that

29:57.200 --> 29:58.200
will be.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.800
And I can't properly make that determination right now on any service.

30:00.800 --> 30:04.480
That's a tough thing to sort out right now.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.480
And the only –

30:05.480 --> 30:08.760
Especially where it's like all the other desktops.

30:08.760 --> 30:12.320
What is left of the desktop experience is becoming a lot of integrated with services.

30:12.320 --> 30:16.200
So it's kind of a question we need to address in the Linux world if even GNOME is doing

30:16.200 --> 30:17.200
it.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.200
Yeah.

30:18.200 --> 30:19.200
I agree.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.200
Ww, you have a thought on the pledges?

30:20.200 --> 30:25.400
The thing is privacy pledges are pretty much said like off the top of anybody's head

30:25.400 --> 30:28.400
nowadays by whoever.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.960
And they could pledge themselves to whatever.

30:30.960 --> 30:36.560
It's actions and transparency that are more important that people need to see.

30:36.560 --> 30:40.160
They need to see, hey, what's going on with my data?

30:40.160 --> 30:44.320
For me, I don't think we'll – I don't know if we'll ever see this.

30:44.320 --> 30:50.000
I want to be able to see how the data was used and what you guys are doing with it rather

30:50.000 --> 30:56.860
than saying – having a marketing person or a social community member of your team

30:56.860 --> 30:58.600
say this stuff.

30:58.600 --> 31:03.560
People need to see concrete evidence that you guys are doing right by the community

31:03.560 --> 31:04.560
or by them.

31:04.560 --> 31:05.560
Yeah.

31:05.560 --> 31:10.360
You know, so have you guys noticed – I mean, I just today logged in to Google because I

31:10.360 --> 31:12.840
was curious – what was I reading about?

31:12.840 --> 31:13.840
Oh, Mussolini.

31:13.840 --> 31:19.760
I was reading about Mussolini and I was curious how much of that would show up in my Google

31:19.760 --> 31:20.760
history.

31:20.760 --> 31:23.200
And there's two sets of Google history when you're a Chrome user.

31:23.200 --> 31:28.440
There's your browser history and then there is everything Chrome sends to Google.

31:28.440 --> 31:34.440
And so they actually legitimately make that manageable.

31:34.440 --> 31:37.080
Because I'm so often a skeptic of Google, I do want to give them credit here.

31:37.080 --> 31:41.280
In Chrome, in your history, they say you should also check what Google services know about

31:41.280 --> 31:42.320
you and you click that.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.620
They make it very obvious.

31:43.620 --> 31:45.720
They really do tell you what Google knows about you.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.680
Like they know – and I just showed up right away.

31:48.680 --> 31:51.480
Like it shows that I listen to Pocket Cast on my drive.

31:51.480 --> 31:54.840
They know what time I open up Pocket Cast and how long I listen to a podcast.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.480
Every morning I drive into work.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.720
It is something.

31:58.720 --> 32:03.040
Yeah, there is that angle too because there's like I think a certain component of Google,

32:03.040 --> 32:08.240
of how we perceive Google's awareness and creepiness, etc. that like even if they are

32:08.240 --> 32:11.000
doing – I'm not saying necessarily that they are, but even if they are doing everything

32:11.000 --> 32:15.520
correctly in terms of prompting you for what you want, they're so much a part of our lives

32:15.520 --> 32:18.900
that even if you've said yes to all these things, you forget about it and sometimes

32:18.900 --> 32:22.000
you realize again how much they do know and you're like, oh.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.560
Antonis, you have a tip for users to sort of see what Google knows about them.

32:26.560 --> 32:27.560
Yeah.

32:27.560 --> 32:33.120
So with Google Dashboard, you can go take a look and see what Google tracks.

32:33.120 --> 32:37.960
If you have an Android phone especially, you can see where you've been with the Google

32:37.960 --> 32:38.960
Maps.

32:38.960 --> 32:43.840
It will show your location history and also even if you use Google Now with your voice,

32:43.840 --> 32:45.800
it even shows you previous voice searches.

32:45.800 --> 32:49.040
You can listen to them and it's kind of like a diary of all the places you've been.

32:49.040 --> 32:51.480
I hear it back and I'm like, oh yeah, that was when I was in the car with the kids and

32:51.480 --> 32:54.240
they were jacking in the background the whole time.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.760
Yeah, the dashboard is creepy and also a very nice feature.

32:57.760 --> 33:02.520
But it leaves me with this and the no maps thing was also another lesson.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.080
Do I have to be an extremist?

33:04.080 --> 33:07.040
Do I have to be like all self-hosting or bust?

33:07.040 --> 33:08.040
Right.

33:08.040 --> 33:10.000
I mean, because that just seems unrealistic at some point.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.240
There's a lot of services at some point you just, you know, convenience wins.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.240
Yeah.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.240
Yeah.

33:15.240 --> 33:19.820
And you know, that is something we talked about a little bit last week, how sometimes

33:19.820 --> 33:29.480
open source loses when your time becomes more precious than your values about software freedom.

33:29.480 --> 33:33.800
I still sort of with every single service have to go through that evaluation.

33:33.800 --> 33:39.400
Because there's like a certain amount of, you know, yes, and it can be, I think, okay,

33:39.400 --> 33:44.160
if you consciously value here like, well, the thing that these people are offering is

33:44.160 --> 33:47.660
they have their own little layer on top of these open source tools that they do for me

33:47.660 --> 33:49.880
and I like that because I just don't have time to do it.

33:49.880 --> 33:52.920
But you do have to kind of value like, well, do they contribute back to those open source

33:52.920 --> 33:54.840
tools that I might otherwise be using?

33:54.840 --> 33:56.920
Are they good citizen in open source?

33:56.920 --> 33:57.920
Do I think they're going to vanish?

33:57.920 --> 33:58.920
Are they going to change models?

33:58.920 --> 34:00.720
It's a lot of things to think about.

34:00.720 --> 34:05.200
Minimac, you have a point about once you have privacy settings set up correctly on Google,

34:05.200 --> 34:07.880
they managed to seem to stick with it, right?

34:07.880 --> 34:10.000
Yeah, they stick with all devices.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.280
You see, I also have an Android TV and all that stuff.

34:13.280 --> 34:16.360
So I have a lot of Android stuff now.

34:16.360 --> 34:21.760
And once you can figure out your privacy settings, all devices are synced and applied to these

34:21.760 --> 34:22.760
settings.

34:22.760 --> 34:23.760
I find that pretty cool.

34:23.760 --> 34:24.760
Yeah, that is nice.

34:24.760 --> 34:29.800
That is nice that they legitimately at least seem to make an effort to make it clear and

34:29.800 --> 34:30.800
coherent.

34:30.800 --> 34:34.720
And you can compare and contrast that to what Facebook does, where it's still not clear

34:34.720 --> 34:35.720
and it's confusing.

34:35.720 --> 34:36.720
And they change it all the time.

34:36.720 --> 34:37.720
Yeah.

34:37.720 --> 34:38.720
Yeah.

34:38.720 --> 34:42.120
Yeah, you really have to dig all these settings once, but there are a lot of settings you

34:42.120 --> 34:43.120
can change.

34:43.120 --> 34:48.520
It is, you know, it is honestly to say that a hosted service that somebody else manages

34:48.520 --> 34:52.480
for you is maintenance free and doesn't require your time to keep it going and running is

34:52.480 --> 34:55.840
false because when you have services like Google that knows much about you, you do kind

34:55.840 --> 34:58.320
of need to go in there and manage it from time to time and see what they're tracking,

34:58.320 --> 35:01.120
see if you're comfortable with that because they're always adding stuff.

35:01.120 --> 35:04.520
And the thing about hosted services too is they may add stuff, they may remove stuff

35:04.520 --> 35:06.080
and you have no say in the matter.

35:06.080 --> 35:10.040
Of course, I think ultimately to decide whether you need to do that evaluation or not, just

35:10.040 --> 35:12.160
ask yourself, are you the product here?

35:12.160 --> 35:13.160
Right.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.160
Oh, yeah.

35:14.160 --> 35:15.160
That's an interesting metric.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.160
Yeah.

35:16.160 --> 35:19.520
I think – I read a book that says that as time goes on, more and more average citizens

35:19.520 --> 35:23.720
will start asking themselves that question, but so far I haven't really seen that play

35:23.720 --> 35:24.720
out.

35:24.720 --> 35:25.720
We will see.

35:25.720 --> 35:30.320
I actually – speaking of Google, so the rest of the show – not the rest of the show.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.320
That's not true at all.

35:31.320 --> 35:34.960
The next segment of the show is going to be kind of Google heavy, but it's actually

35:34.960 --> 35:38.480
sort of using some Google – bypassing some Google services.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.920
It's the Chromecast but not using Google.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.980
So before we get off self-hosting entirely, it would be a good time to mention Digital

35:43.980 --> 35:48.680
Ocean and you can support the show by going over to Digital Ocean and reusing our promo

35:48.680 --> 35:49.680
code DOUNPLUGGED.

35:49.680 --> 35:53.440
It's one word, it's lowercase, you apply it to your account balance.

35:53.440 --> 35:58.520
Now I think in response to this conversation that you and I were just having, probably

35:58.520 --> 36:03.400
the key thing about Digital Ocean that I think has really contributed to their success is

36:03.400 --> 36:05.040
that it's really fast to get going.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.080
It's simple, it's straightforward.

36:07.080 --> 36:13.360
And so the cost of trying something like a project like NextCloud or Rocket Chat or GitLab

36:13.360 --> 36:14.360
is …

36:14.360 --> 36:16.920
Aaron Ross Powell The speed plus the per hour billing kind of

36:16.920 --> 36:17.920
stuff.

36:17.920 --> 36:18.920
Jason Kuznicki Yeah.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.680
And in like the case of GitLab, the entire application stack, if you just want to just

36:21.680 --> 36:26.720
deploy the entire stack on an LTS distro, is ready to go and you just plug in the details

36:26.720 --> 36:29.020
you need and it's set up.

36:29.020 --> 36:35.280
So that is really giving people the opportunity to try out self-hosting in a way that doesn't

36:35.280 --> 36:37.800
mean a huge time commitment.

36:37.800 --> 36:40.200
Aaron Ross Powell You're not provisioning a bare metal server,

36:40.200 --> 36:41.440
you're not worrying about colo.

36:41.440 --> 36:42.440
Jason Kuznicki Yeah.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.240
And look at this pricing.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.820
And so you can see like you could really, once you get going, you could really have

36:46.820 --> 36:49.840
something that is just running all the time.

36:49.840 --> 36:54.480
I love this middle plan here, three cents an hour, two gigs of RAM, two core processor,

36:54.480 --> 36:55.480
40 gigabyte SSD.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.480
Aaron Ross Powell That's really what does it.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.480
Jason Kuznicki Yeah.

36:57.480 --> 36:58.480
That's, I mean, wow.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.480
Right?

36:59.480 --> 37:02.680
When you have super fast, they're all SSDs, they have really great internet connections,

37:02.680 --> 37:05.920
they have data centers all over the world and when you have all of that on a machine

37:05.920 --> 37:11.680
with two core processors, if it's for you, your business or your family, that is going

37:11.680 --> 37:14.840
to be a screaming machine and it's really easy to step up and upgrade.

37:14.840 --> 37:18.840
And if you want to play with something like Nextcloud and your storage starts to grow,

37:18.840 --> 37:22.360
it's a totally different story now on DigitalOcean than it was even a couple of months ago because

37:22.360 --> 37:28.280
they have serious block storage now that is going to make it possible for you to grow

37:28.280 --> 37:31.720
your storage on your droplet as you need at a really nice price.

37:31.720 --> 37:36.160
Highly available block storage, you attach it to your droplet and of course, because

37:36.160 --> 37:39.360
it's DigitalOcean, it's SSD-backed block storage.

37:39.360 --> 37:40.360
Yes.

37:40.360 --> 37:44.680
You know, I talk a lot about the DigitalOcean interface and how freaking great it is.

37:44.680 --> 37:47.200
I often will mention their API.

37:47.200 --> 37:51.200
So this week, I thought I'd give you a few examples of why they really just have one

37:51.200 --> 37:52.960
of the best APIs out there.

37:52.960 --> 37:57.240
It's well-documented, they iterate on it as part of their entire platform feature set

37:57.240 --> 38:02.440
and then because it's so clear and because it's documented, there's a ton of nice code

38:02.440 --> 38:04.000
you can take advantage of already.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.560
I like this Runbook.io project which uses DigitalOcean's API.

38:09.560 --> 38:13.080
It's available, it's free, you can grab it and it monitors and automatically resolves

38:13.080 --> 38:18.760
issue with if this, then that style automation for your droplets, which could be neat.

38:18.760 --> 38:26.600
Like reactions from anything, like restarting Apache, rebooting a DigitalOcean droplet completely,

38:26.600 --> 38:33.360
it is what you get if Nagios and if then, then that had a baby.

38:33.360 --> 38:38.000
If those two things came together and had a mad passionate love session, this is the

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
child they would produce.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.840
That sounds like a great recipe for not getting woken up in the middle of the night.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.680
It is exactly that.

38:43.680 --> 38:48.000
Also, this is kind of neat, I thought this was kind of cool, a DigitalOcean dynamic DNS

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
project.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
Okay, that is neat.

38:50.000 --> 38:55.580
Yeah, the script allows you to dynamically update a DO domain name A record like a mini

38:55.580 --> 38:57.040
dynamic DNS update.

38:57.040 --> 39:00.760
See, those are all things that you could write for yourself, but because it's so easy with

39:00.760 --> 39:02.360
DigitalOcean, someone's done it for you.

39:02.360 --> 39:03.360
Yeah, it's cool.

39:03.360 --> 39:04.360
It's right there.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.360
It is really cool.

39:05.360 --> 39:08.720
Check them out, digitalocean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUG to support the show to

39:08.720 --> 39:13.360

And if you guys see a really cool open source project that uses the DigitalOcean API, please

39:18.760 --> 39:21.060
do tweet it at me.

39:21.060 --> 39:25.720
So before we get into the whole discussion about the rest of the Chromecast stuff and

39:25.720 --> 39:29.000
Kodi stuff, I thought maybe we'd take a moment and talk about why we're discussing this

39:29.000 --> 39:34.080
at the moment because just recently, it was revealed how dramatic the Chromecast sales

39:34.080 --> 39:35.080
have been.

39:35.080 --> 39:38.720
Google has not traditionally shared numbers on this, but in a conference call, they were

39:38.720 --> 39:44.040
confronted and Sundar Pichai actually answered.

39:44.040 --> 39:48.320
When responding to questions, he revealed that the company has shipped 30 million Chromecast

39:48.320 --> 39:52.080
units since its release back in 2013, which includes all the different iterations, even

39:52.080 --> 39:53.080
the Chromecast audio.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.080
30 million units.

39:54.080 --> 39:55.080
Do you have one?

39:55.080 --> 39:56.080
I do.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.080
I actually have two.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.080
Yeah, I have two as well.

39:58.080 --> 40:02.920
In fact, I've even bought one for friends before because they didn't have anything to

40:02.920 --> 40:05.240
like watch like YouTube or anything on their TV.

40:05.240 --> 40:08.400
And bought it for parents or family or yep.

40:08.400 --> 40:11.600
We have one here at the studio, which has been great when we have people over and we

40:11.600 --> 40:14.820
have a big group and people want to watch different YouTube videos.

40:14.820 --> 40:18.680
My Nvidia Shield TV I talked about on Linux Action Show this Sunday has Chromecast support

40:18.680 --> 40:19.680
built into it.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.500
A lot of apps have Chromecast support stuff for like, you know, lots of stuff for like

40:23.500 --> 40:28.280
having them run displays, Android and I believe has a lot of more a lot more Chromecast stuff

40:28.280 --> 40:30.420
built into the OS level.

40:30.420 --> 40:35.140
So I thought, okay, let's talk about ways that us Linux users can get content from our

40:35.140 --> 40:37.200
Linux boxes on the Chromecast.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.060
And maybe if the mumble room knows of some open source hardware replacements or alternatives

40:40.060 --> 40:41.760
to Chromecast, we can talk about those too.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.640
But I want to start with the easy button.

40:43.640 --> 40:48.200
So that way, if you're listening and you want something super applicable to you, and you

40:48.200 --> 40:51.480
just and you just want that right off the top.

40:51.480 --> 40:54.800
I've used this from time to time, I don't keep it installed in Chrome when I'm not using

40:54.800 --> 40:55.800
it.

40:55.800 --> 40:58.040
But it's video streaming for Google Chrome.

40:58.040 --> 41:02.380
And it allows you to load any local video file on your Linux box.

41:02.380 --> 41:06.600
It opens up as like an app inside your Chrome browser, you can open then you can use the

41:06.600 --> 41:10.380
local file browser to pick any local file.

41:10.380 --> 41:13.360
And it will stream this to your Chromecast from your Linux box.

41:13.360 --> 41:17.260
This is just a quick dirty install in 30 seconds, you can be streaming to a Chromecast.

41:17.260 --> 41:20.360
It doesn't go out to the Google account and servers and send it down, it just goes directly

41:20.360 --> 41:22.080
from your laptop to your Chromecast.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.400
So that's just a that's a Chrome plugin.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.060
But that's not super cool.

41:26.060 --> 41:27.060
And that's not Linux specific.

41:27.060 --> 41:29.880
And you have to pay for some things if you want more features.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.360
Yeah, there is something you have to pay for.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.360
It doesn't deserve that.

41:32.360 --> 41:33.440
I'm not saying that.

41:33.440 --> 41:36.120
But I can't even remember what it was you have to pay for, because I just use it for

41:36.120 --> 41:37.880
the basic feature set.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.280
But cast now could be another option.

41:39.280 --> 41:40.280
So check this out.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.840
Cast now is a command line utility.

41:41.840 --> 41:42.840
Hey, here we go.

41:42.840 --> 41:45.760
Okay, do playback media files to your Chromecast device.

41:45.760 --> 41:50.920
It supports playback of local video files, videos on the web and torrents too.

41:50.920 --> 41:54.560
You can also reattach a running playback session, which is really nice.

41:54.560 --> 41:56.180
So it's cast now.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.000
And it's just really simple syntax.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.560
You do cast now and then the directory that has the videos in it, you can play the entire

42:02.560 --> 42:09.200
directory or the specific file or you drop in a URL to like an MP4 file, or a torrent

42:09.200 --> 42:10.200
file.

42:10.200 --> 42:14.840
You can also do better luck sometimes like persnickety HLS streams, that sort of stuff.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.320
Cast now seems to work pretty well with.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.320
Yeah?

42:17.320 --> 42:18.320
Nice.

42:18.320 --> 42:22.320
So cast now, just a simple tool to install and you can do that from the command line.

42:22.320 --> 42:24.860
I know how much we love our command line utilities.

42:24.860 --> 42:26.880
So that seemed like a good one.

42:26.880 --> 42:27.880
Then there was this one that came in.

42:27.880 --> 42:31.840
A contender that's getting some update and coverage on web update this week streamed

42:31.840 --> 42:36.860
a Chromecast, stream to Chromecast, the number two, is a command line Chromecast media streamer

42:36.860 --> 42:37.860
for Linux.

42:37.860 --> 42:41.640
It can transcode to unsupported formats in real time and play them on the Chromecast.

42:41.640 --> 42:44.640
It can also do audio, so it can send audio only.

42:44.640 --> 42:49.480
It can transcode any format not supported by the Chromecast using FFmpeg or LibAV, provides

42:49.480 --> 42:52.960
basic control commands like pause, unpause, stop, and playback.

42:52.960 --> 42:55.760
You can do specific devices when you have multiple Chromecast on your network, which

42:55.760 --> 42:56.760
is nice.

42:56.760 --> 42:57.760
Yeah.

42:57.760 --> 43:01.540
Supports passing custom transcoder parameters to FFmpeg and supports specifying the port

43:01.540 --> 43:03.200
to use for streaming media.

43:03.200 --> 43:07.400
For audio only files, no metadata is displayed on the Chromecast at the moment.

43:07.400 --> 43:10.480
So these are two different command line utilities that will take video files or audio files

43:10.480 --> 43:12.800
and send them to your – now, have you tried stream?

43:12.800 --> 43:15.280
I haven't but after this show, I think I will.

43:15.280 --> 43:16.280
Yeah.

43:16.280 --> 43:17.280
That's really nice.

43:17.280 --> 43:20.880
That's really – that is kind of changing my opinion about the Chromecast a little more

43:20.880 --> 43:23.560
especially since I have it built into the Shield 2.

43:23.560 --> 43:26.960
There are like so many of those services where it's a little bit like, well, it works great

43:26.960 --> 43:30.760
and Netflix and YouTube obviously have great support for it but there are some like outliers

43:30.760 --> 43:32.280
where you're like, it is frustrating.

43:32.280 --> 43:33.280
You don't have full access.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.480
You don't have root on it, right?

43:34.480 --> 43:36.360
So this does help with that.

43:36.360 --> 43:40.560
Irocast, what's this, NorthRanger?

43:40.560 --> 43:44.640
Actually it was just, you know, me doing a little bit of Googling a few days ago actually

43:44.640 --> 43:49.160
trying to figure out my Kodi box on a Raspberry Pi to extend some functionality.

43:49.160 --> 43:53.400
I haven't tried it yet so I'm curious if anybody else has found a similar solution

43:53.400 --> 43:56.600
for like LibreELEC or OpenELEC type distributions.

43:56.600 --> 43:57.800
Yeah.

43:57.800 --> 44:04.760
Like so you want to – you want to be able to have Chromecast like functionality with

44:04.760 --> 44:07.400
Kodi, is what you're saying.

44:07.400 --> 44:08.400
Exactly.

44:08.400 --> 44:09.400
Hmm.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.400
Interesting.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.400
Interesting.

44:11.400 --> 44:16.800
You know, I believe there could be somebody working on such a thing right now.

44:16.800 --> 44:24.560
Dr. Tanel in the Mumble Room, a.k.a. formerly known as Rotten Corpse, sir, could you perhaps

44:24.560 --> 44:27.720
have something up your sleeve just like this?

44:27.720 --> 44:30.520
Well, I mean that's convenient.

44:30.520 --> 44:33.000
That – convenient with a K even.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
Heyo.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.000
Well, Kast for Kodi is what I'm working on which is a script that does exactly that

44:39.000 --> 44:48.800
and it adds – be able to stream live video through like Twitch or RTMP streams or anything

44:48.800 --> 44:49.800
like that.

44:49.800 --> 44:57.440
It also supports local videos through like Samba and I recently fixed some things that

44:57.440 --> 44:58.440
you can now do torrent streaming.

44:58.440 --> 44:59.440
Oh.

44:59.440 --> 45:06.720
Yeah, like a MetaLink for some kind of video, it'll – like the torrents that JB has,

45:06.720 --> 45:08.520
it'll play those through that.

45:08.520 --> 45:09.520
Cool.

45:09.520 --> 45:13.960
And it also supports multiple devices so you can have multiple Raspberry Pis with Kodi

45:13.960 --> 45:20.200
on it or OpenELEC even and a lot more features that I'm working on too.

45:20.200 --> 45:27.420
It supports about 15 current add-ons for Kodi including YouTube, Twitch, Dailymotion and

45:27.420 --> 45:28.420
many more.

45:28.420 --> 45:29.420
Heyo.

45:29.420 --> 45:30.420
And of course, YouTube broadcasting.

45:30.420 --> 45:31.420
Heyo.

45:31.420 --> 45:32.420
Hey.

45:32.420 --> 45:34.760
So the interface for this is a command line utility as well?

45:34.760 --> 45:36.840
It has both a GUI and a command line.

45:36.840 --> 45:38.020
The GUI is very simple.

45:38.020 --> 45:40.800
It uses Zenity to provide that.

45:40.800 --> 45:41.800
Okay, nice.

45:41.800 --> 45:44.880
And like it's just like a – hey, select the file you want to send to the Kodi machine

45:44.880 --> 45:45.880
and then it's looking?

45:45.880 --> 45:46.880
Yeah.

45:46.880 --> 45:51.560
Well, the – it uses the file manager to do the local file sending so you just right

45:51.560 --> 45:57.040
click and send it to the file – send it through the script to your Kodi device.

45:57.040 --> 46:01.720
So what is the technology behind the scenes that's making my desktop talk to the Kodi

46:01.720 --> 46:02.720
software?

46:02.720 --> 46:12.400
Well, it's basically just a Bash script on one end, a JSON API on the Kodi end, and

46:12.400 --> 46:16.400
then whatever file manager you have that supports, you know –

46:16.400 --> 46:17.400
Send to Actions or whatever?

46:17.400 --> 46:18.400
– adding extensions.

46:18.400 --> 46:19.400
Yeah.

46:19.400 --> 46:20.400
Yeah, exactly.

46:20.400 --> 46:24.200
But what I'm trying to get to is like is there like some DLNA standard that Kodi supports,

46:24.200 --> 46:27.840
universal plug and play like discovery like what is – what's happening?

46:27.840 --> 46:29.320
Is it a dynamic DNS?

46:29.320 --> 46:34.900
What's happening on the back end to make my Linux box capable of sending a video file

46:34.900 --> 46:36.560
over the network to Kodi?

46:36.560 --> 46:41.480
What two technologies or whatever multiple technologies are connecting to make that happen?

46:41.480 --> 46:47.480
Well the actual sending of it is pushing the data – the signal through curl to the Kodi

46:47.480 --> 46:52.240
box and the Kodi takes whatever signal you give it and then applies its effects.

46:52.240 --> 46:58.500
So technically like if you're watching a YouTube video, it's not going through your

46:58.500 --> 46:59.500
computer first.

46:59.500 --> 47:02.720
It's just sending the signal to play the YouTube video on your Kodi box.

47:02.720 --> 47:03.720
Oh.

47:03.720 --> 47:04.920
So it's just going from YouTube straight to Kodi.

47:04.920 --> 47:06.360
How does it – so how does it – okay.

47:06.360 --> 47:10.360
So how does it handle the scenario if one time I'm sending it an MP4 file and the next

47:10.360 --> 47:12.760
time I'm sending it a URL?

47:12.760 --> 47:15.960
It detects on – it runs scans based on what you're sending.

47:15.960 --> 47:19.880
Kodi already has – Kodi already has facilities to do that.

47:19.880 --> 47:20.880
Huh.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.920
No, Kodi has the ability to take the signal in.

47:23.920 --> 47:24.920
Oh, your script is –

47:24.920 --> 47:26.360
The script is actually scanning everything.

47:26.360 --> 47:27.360
So is it possible –

47:27.360 --> 47:28.480
So if you send it something and it –

47:28.480 --> 47:30.600
Is it possible for you to send like torrent metadata?

47:30.600 --> 47:34.920
So like if I'm say pulling down TechSnap and via torrent will it pull down like the

47:34.920 --> 47:37.880
episode name and all that kind of stuff and show that on Kodi?

47:37.880 --> 47:38.880
Yes.

47:38.880 --> 47:39.880
Nice.

47:39.880 --> 47:40.880
Wow.

47:40.880 --> 47:41.880
Damn.

47:41.880 --> 47:42.880
That is slick.

47:42.880 --> 47:47.320
Now what do you think like future way out totally down the road possibilities like to

47:47.320 --> 47:51.920
have this show up as like – to show up in the share sheet on Android as like an option

47:51.920 --> 47:56.440
to send a file to when I open up in VLC or something like that?

47:56.440 --> 47:59.400
I haven't working on – I wasn't working on Android support.

47:59.400 --> 48:01.520
Basically just Linux desktop support is the only thing I –

48:01.520 --> 48:02.520
Yeah.

48:02.520 --> 48:04.080
But there would be anything to prevent that?

48:04.080 --> 48:06.560
I mean that would be theoretically possible maybe?

48:06.560 --> 48:08.440
Yeah, it would be possible for sure, yes.

48:08.440 --> 48:09.440
Yeah.

48:09.440 --> 48:10.440
How do we really –

48:10.440 --> 48:14.640
There's some features that you can already do that on Android with – I'm pretty sure

48:14.640 --> 48:19.080
the core – the K-O-R-E remote has some features like that.

48:19.080 --> 48:20.080
Oh, okay.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.080
Okay.

48:21.080 --> 48:26.280
I'm not sure how well it does it or how extensive it is in comparison but I think it does work

48:26.280 --> 48:27.880
for like the basics.

48:27.880 --> 48:34.120
So is this – so this requires no changes or add-ons to Kodi at all for this to work?

48:34.120 --> 48:35.640
No, it doesn't.

48:35.640 --> 48:37.080
Some things require the add-ons.

48:37.080 --> 48:40.780
So for example, I mean you're going to add these add-ons anyway so if you wanted to watch

48:40.780 --> 48:43.320
YouTube on Kodi you got to install the YouTube add-on.

48:43.320 --> 48:44.320
Sure.

48:44.320 --> 48:47.160
And then it uses the YouTube add-on to send the signal to.

48:47.160 --> 48:48.160
Sure, okay.

48:48.160 --> 48:52.800
So basically what it does is that it takes – it figures out what you want to send it

48:52.800 --> 49:01.040
to the script then it creates the signal in the syntax that Kodi wants then it says this

49:01.040 --> 49:05.740
is a YouTube URL so send it through the YouTube add-on specifically so that way it just immediately

49:05.740 --> 49:10.840
jumps to the add-on and if you have it – if you don't have the add-on it will tell you

49:10.840 --> 49:14.160
that you can't play this design for this particular add-on.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.680
Oh, that's nice.

49:15.680 --> 49:17.960
If you do have it, it will just start playing.

49:17.960 --> 49:22.180
Huh, I can't wait to try it, that's really nice.

49:22.180 --> 49:27.920
I think for me I'm kind of in a position where I don't – I didn't realize this but

49:27.920 --> 49:34.560
using Android TV, not to make this about Android TV, but by using Android TV my KodiBox natively

49:34.560 --> 49:38.800
already supports Chromecast built into it but it wouldn't be – but then when I use

49:38.800 --> 49:42.600
that functionality it drops me out of Kodi so this would allow me to stay in the Kodi

49:42.600 --> 49:43.600
app.

49:43.600 --> 49:44.600
Yeah.

49:44.600 --> 49:45.760
Well, that's cool.

49:45.760 --> 49:48.480
How do we find out more about this?

49:48.480 --> 49:50.120
I just sent a link to the – into the chat.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.120
Oh, perfect, there it is.

49:51.120 --> 49:52.120
Yes, thank you very much.

49:52.120 --> 49:53.120
Oh, okay.

49:53.120 --> 49:55.520
I will put a link in that there, what I like to call show notes.

49:55.520 --> 49:57.040
Did you know we have show notes, Wes?

49:57.040 --> 49:58.040
Yes, we do.

49:58.040 --> 49:59.040
Yeah, that's true.

49:59.040 --> 50:03.120
Just one more quick – I wanted to answer Dream's question about Ubuntu Touch.

50:03.120 --> 50:04.360
It should work in Ubuntu Touch.

50:04.360 --> 50:05.360
Oh, yeah.

50:05.360 --> 50:06.360
Oh, gosh.

50:06.360 --> 50:07.360
Hell yeah.

50:07.360 --> 50:08.360
That makes sense.

50:08.360 --> 50:09.360
I like that.

50:09.360 --> 50:11.360
I like that a lot and I like that it already works with Jupyter Broadcasting.

50:11.360 --> 50:12.360
Boom.

50:12.360 --> 50:13.360
That's great.

50:13.360 --> 50:14.360
That's great.

50:14.360 --> 50:18.200
A bash script tool for creating – for casting media to Kodi Entertainment Center.

50:18.200 --> 50:21.120
So I want to take a little time now to talk about making Kodi great again.

50:21.120 --> 50:25.040
Not that it's not already great but I want to make my Kodi great again.

50:25.040 --> 50:26.040
You guys know me.

50:26.040 --> 50:31.160
I love trying to use open source solutions whenever possible but every now and then that

50:31.160 --> 50:37.120
little voice in the back of my head goes, Chris, just set up Plex.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.120
Just set up Plex.

50:38.120 --> 50:42.560
It will be much easier because then your kids can stream the files they want.

50:42.560 --> 50:45.200
It automatically takes care of the metadata problems you've been having.

50:45.200 --> 50:46.400
You don't have to worry about that.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.680
Just set up Plex.

50:48.680 --> 50:52.560
But now that I've moved and I'm resetting up my home entertainment system and I'm going

50:52.560 --> 50:59.120
to be resetting up network storage and I'm reevaluating anything that requires an internet

50:59.120 --> 51:01.560
connection top to bottom.

51:01.560 --> 51:05.800
And one of the things I don't ever want to have to really deal with is I sit down to

51:05.800 --> 51:09.040
watch TV and I can't because we're somewhere where we don't have internet connection.

51:09.040 --> 51:10.440
I just want my media to work.

51:10.440 --> 51:11.440
I just want my TV to work.

51:11.440 --> 51:14.400
And when you're in that position, you've had a long day, you just want to unwind.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.240
The last thing you want to do is get up and fix whatever's wrong.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.400
Likely like if I'm on a road trip, I've been driving all day long.

51:18.400 --> 51:19.400
Exactly.

51:19.400 --> 51:20.400
You need to put your feet up.

51:20.400 --> 51:23.320
And Kodi is fast, it works great with local media.

51:23.320 --> 51:24.560
It's the best playback interface.

51:24.560 --> 51:25.920
It just really is.

51:25.920 --> 51:26.920
It's got a great UI.

51:26.920 --> 51:29.120
It has great support for like tons of good skins.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.120
IR control.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.120
Yep.

51:31.120 --> 51:32.120
Yep.

51:32.120 --> 51:33.120
Lots of great add-ons.

51:33.120 --> 51:34.120
Some of those skins are just beautiful.

51:34.120 --> 51:35.120
Yeah.

51:35.120 --> 51:36.120
There's a new one coming.

51:36.120 --> 51:37.120
There's a Jupiter broadcasting app.

51:37.120 --> 51:38.120
Whoa.

51:38.120 --> 51:41.920
Yeah, so I'm going to be migrating from Plex to Kodi.

51:41.920 --> 51:43.360
And there's a lot that comes with that.

51:43.360 --> 51:44.360
Yeah.

51:44.360 --> 51:45.360
It's a different paradigm.

51:45.360 --> 51:46.360
It is.

51:46.360 --> 51:47.360
And I do have to rename some of my media.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.220
I have to change how I've done some of that.

51:49.220 --> 51:52.640
And there's different back ends I can use for Kodi, too, if I want a shared Kodi central

51:52.640 --> 51:54.860
database, if I want to take advantage of streaming.

51:54.860 --> 51:59.760
So I want to chat about all these different options, plus get some of the virtual lugs

51:59.760 --> 52:01.920
ideas and takes on some of this.

52:01.920 --> 52:06.560
It's kind of a new adventure for me, because Kodi is a really cool, super impressive open

52:06.560 --> 52:12.520
source application that I have played with on and off every single release since it was

52:12.520 --> 52:14.320
XBMC on a hacked Xbox.

52:14.320 --> 52:15.320
Right, exactly.

52:15.320 --> 52:16.320
I really have.

52:16.320 --> 52:17.320
Humble origins.

52:17.320 --> 52:24.360
But I have never really put 12 terabytes worth of media into it and tried to get playback

52:24.360 --> 52:30.040
and metadata synced across three television screens and then remote streaming for people

52:30.040 --> 52:31.040
on tablets.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.240
I've never gone that far into it.

52:32.240 --> 52:35.200
I've never actually really integrated it.

52:35.200 --> 52:40.800
And that's the route I'm taking now, and it does involve sort of reassessing how I have

52:40.800 --> 52:41.800
things set up.

52:41.800 --> 52:44.880
And if it's something you've ever considered doing or if you have tips on, I'd love to

52:44.880 --> 52:45.880
get your input.

52:45.880 --> 52:48.880
I'm going to mention right now our friends over at Linux Academy.

52:48.880 --> 52:51.780
Linux Academy is where you've got to go to get your basics and then work your way up

52:51.780 --> 52:53.160
to the advanced topics.

52:53.160 --> 52:57.960
If you're thinking about getting some certs, this is a great resource for you, linuxacademy.com

52:57.960 --> 52:59.380
slash unplugged.

52:59.380 --> 53:04.520
They have self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux, cloud, and DevOps topic.

53:04.520 --> 53:09.720
They have hands-on scenario-based labs that give you experience on real servers.

53:09.720 --> 53:13.080
They have learning plans that allow you to pick a course and set a timeframe to fit your

53:13.080 --> 53:16.400
schedule and your learning goals.

53:16.400 --> 53:17.760
They have labs that spin up on demand.

53:17.760 --> 53:22.240
They have instructor mentoring, full-time human instructors happy to advise and answer

53:22.240 --> 53:27.960
questions, nuggets, tiny little sparks of wisdom that go deep into a single topic, iOS

53:27.960 --> 53:32.200
and Android apps so you can study on one of your devices when you're on the go, custom

53:32.200 --> 53:36.240
randomized decks of study cards that can be forked and improved by the community, a community

53:36.240 --> 53:39.880
that's stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members, study guides, lesson audio, personal

53:39.880 --> 53:42.400
notebooks and tools that help you study.

53:42.400 --> 53:47.560
You pick from your distribution to adjust the courseware and the servers and their system

53:47.560 --> 53:52.280
can evaluate you while you perform tasks on their server to give you real-time feedback.

53:52.280 --> 53:57.780
With hands-on guides that give you real-world experience, the feedback system, the study

53:57.780 --> 54:02.520
tools and the learning plans that allow you to pick your availability, nobody can touch

54:02.520 --> 54:05.400
Linux Academy and they're growing like crazy.

54:05.400 --> 54:13.640
They just announced a major, major partnership with a real actual physical school.

54:13.640 --> 54:17.120
This is something they've been growing on more and more recently and I think it's kind

54:17.120 --> 54:20.520
of an interesting way to take the Linux Academy hands-on training experience and offering

54:20.520 --> 54:25.560
it to students at a traditional university level class and they're getting real college

54:25.560 --> 54:26.560
credits for it.

54:26.560 --> 54:29.040
It's fascinating they have more information over on their blog.

54:29.040 --> 54:34.160
They've got the best tools to prepare you for search in a variety of Linux, AWS, OpenStack,

54:34.160 --> 54:38.480
DevOps, Azure and big data topics if you're searching for those search, it's a great platform

54:38.480 --> 54:39.480
for this too.

54:39.480 --> 54:45.320
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

54:45.320 --> 54:48.480
the unplugged program.

54:48.480 --> 54:52.480
Now I want to start with the obvious, this is like the due diligence segment of the show.

54:52.480 --> 54:59.160
I have to mention this part so I'm contractually obligated to reference you to the Kodi Wiki

54:59.160 --> 55:02.800
on naming video files and TV shows correctly.

55:02.800 --> 55:06.880
So this is the canonical guide by the project that's being updated all the time.

55:06.880 --> 55:10.140
They give you hierarchy examples, et cetera, et cetera, to follow.

55:10.140 --> 55:11.880
This is sort of the golden standard.

55:11.880 --> 55:15.520
So that is linked in the show notes right at the top of this segment if you're going

55:15.520 --> 55:16.520
to get into this.

55:16.520 --> 55:19.200
Have you any experience like going through and naming this stuff?

55:19.200 --> 55:21.320
For MB, I've always used FileBot.

55:21.320 --> 55:23.120
Tell me about FileBot, Wes.

55:23.120 --> 55:25.160
Tell me about FileBot.

55:25.160 --> 55:27.120
FileBot is a script that...

55:27.120 --> 55:28.120
Oh really?

55:28.120 --> 55:31.560
Yeah, and it has some parameters, specific parameters they call...

55:31.560 --> 55:33.560
FileBot.net.

55:33.560 --> 55:35.000
Automated Media Center and so...

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Is this it?

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
This?

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
This is it right here?

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Is this it?

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
With a GUI?

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
Yeah, that looks right.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
I think it's a Java program actually.

55:42.000 --> 55:43.000
Oh, snap, son.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.500
And here, let me throw in the Automated Media Center link right there which is kind of around

55:45.500 --> 55:47.640
a forum but it works very well.

55:47.640 --> 55:53.600
You kind of pull down your torrents or Usenet or however you have your media, you then run

55:53.600 --> 55:54.600
it on that folder.

55:54.600 --> 55:55.600
You can set it up to auto run.

55:55.600 --> 55:58.720
I'm sure you could use something like I notify wait if you wanted to do it that way or system

55:58.720 --> 56:00.520
D timer or anything.

56:00.520 --> 56:05.520
So this sounds like something that you could plug in with a Usenet downloader and have

56:05.520 --> 56:06.520
it automatically...

56:06.520 --> 56:07.520
Yes, absolutely.

56:07.520 --> 56:11.000
Or like some torrent clients support triggering programs to run, that kind of thing.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.760
So you can also have support for running things so like you can have it use butterfs reflinks,

56:14.760 --> 56:16.960
you can have it make symlinks when it organizes them.

56:16.960 --> 56:20.280
This is never really something I ever had to worry about with Plex.

56:20.280 --> 56:25.800
Like everything I just download or backup and I throw in there and I name somewhat correctly,

56:25.800 --> 56:28.320
Plex seems to grab it and nail it every single time.

56:28.320 --> 56:29.840
Like it seems to be really good at that.

56:29.840 --> 56:31.400
I think some people use it with Plex too.

56:31.400 --> 56:32.880
Alex I know that's what I've heard about it from.

56:32.880 --> 56:36.800
So I was thinking about trying out Tiny Media Manager which is kind of the same thing.

56:36.800 --> 56:40.160
Does a scan, it helps you manage the file naming and all that.

56:40.160 --> 56:43.760
Tiny Media Manager, a multi-OS media management tool.

56:43.760 --> 56:47.800
So what I'm thinking right is I got to get the original set of media correct first.

56:47.800 --> 56:48.800
Exactly.

56:48.800 --> 56:49.920
I got to go through a lot of files.

56:49.920 --> 56:52.160
Lots of seasons of crap and all that stuff that I love.

56:52.160 --> 56:57.800
Just stuff that I treasure but maybe I have sort of let the automated system manage the

56:57.800 --> 56:58.800
naming of it.

56:58.800 --> 57:02.040
This looks like a great interface to kind of explore that and make sure everything checks

57:02.040 --> 57:03.040
out.

57:03.040 --> 57:04.040
I like that it has a GUI.

57:04.040 --> 57:05.040
That's great.

57:05.040 --> 57:06.040
Yeah.

57:06.040 --> 57:07.040
Yeah.

57:07.040 --> 57:09.120
And it does look like it's pretty straightforward to use too.

57:09.120 --> 57:15.400
So that's sort of what I've found so far in how to sort of set up and prep my Kodi library.

57:15.400 --> 57:19.920
I don't know if anybody in the Mumble Room has tips for managing Kodi.

57:19.920 --> 57:25.680
And just to give you a picture here, I have been attempting to sort of move stuff in to

57:25.680 --> 57:29.760
see what just works without having to just sort of manage it.

57:29.760 --> 57:31.720
And it's pretty hit and miss so far.

57:31.720 --> 57:33.120
So it hasn't been perfect.

57:33.120 --> 57:37.000
I think one of the things that I want to sort of transition to is talking about some of

57:37.000 --> 57:39.600
the backend solutions you can use here.

57:39.600 --> 57:46.640
The ones that I've gotten feedback on are obviously MB backend for Kodi and Plex backend

57:46.640 --> 57:47.640
for Kodi.

57:47.640 --> 57:49.520
Wes, have you messed with the MB backend for Kodi?

57:49.520 --> 57:50.520
And what's the advantage?

57:50.520 --> 57:51.520
What's the reason?

57:51.520 --> 57:52.520
Why would I do that?

57:52.520 --> 57:54.120
Not just use Kodi's built-in database?

57:54.120 --> 57:58.480
Well, I used it to share my MB library with my parents.

57:58.480 --> 58:03.320
So I installed Kodi on a NUC at their house and VPNed our two networks together.

58:03.320 --> 58:06.720
And then I connected the MB plugin for Kodi with my MB server.

58:06.720 --> 58:10.080
And so I could then have local media there for them if they want, but like the NUC had

58:10.080 --> 58:11.760
a limited hard drive space, right?

58:11.760 --> 58:15.520
So then anything at my house just looked like it was right in the Kodi database.

58:15.520 --> 58:16.520
They could play it.

58:16.520 --> 58:18.960
It was transparent to them.

58:18.960 --> 58:25.040
So for me, it seems like the advantages of using MB on the backend or Plex would be that

58:25.040 --> 58:31.580
I can let MB and Plex scan the media, manage that, set up the libraries.

58:31.580 --> 58:35.440
You also get the web interface to go in and correct mistakes or watch it and stream it

58:35.440 --> 58:38.520
myself, which is a big deal.

58:38.520 --> 58:42.160
And I can then sync watch status across my Kodi instances.

58:42.160 --> 58:43.920
Does that work okay?

58:43.920 --> 58:45.360
It did seem to.

58:45.360 --> 58:48.320
I made multiple users.

58:48.320 --> 58:51.000
There was a little bit of an issue, I think, with how you do it.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.520
And I think if you want to have multiple users, there was kind of some workarounds you had

58:53.520 --> 58:57.520
to do because I think by default, it syncs it into the info files, but there are some

58:57.520 --> 58:58.520
options there.

58:58.520 --> 58:59.520
Interesting.

58:59.520 --> 59:00.520
So that's...

59:00.520 --> 59:01.520
MB is definitely...

59:01.520 --> 59:02.520
And the nice thing is...

59:02.520 --> 59:07.160
Just with how smoothly it integrated and if you have a good link to your MB backend, playback

59:07.160 --> 59:08.160
was seamless.

59:08.160 --> 59:12.760
So the other one I'm considering a lot since I have an existing Plex database, but I probably

59:12.760 --> 59:13.760
would not...

59:13.760 --> 59:14.760
I'm probably not going to go this route.

59:14.760 --> 59:19.520
But one that I am looking at and it was pretty, pretty strongly recommended in the subreddit

59:19.520 --> 59:23.520
after last this weekend is Plex Kodi Connect, PKC.

59:23.520 --> 59:28.240
It combines the best front-end media player Kodi with the best multimedia backend server

59:28.240 --> 59:29.240
Plex.

59:29.240 --> 59:31.280
And I do have like a lifetime Plex pass or something like that.

59:31.280 --> 59:32.280
So that's also...

59:32.280 --> 59:34.360
Well, isn't the backend of Plex open source?

59:34.360 --> 59:35.920
It's the front-end that is closed source?

59:35.920 --> 59:36.920
Oh.

59:36.920 --> 59:37.920
So that would be nice.

59:37.920 --> 59:40.040
I'm not sure if that's still the case, but at one time, wasn't that?

59:40.040 --> 59:42.520
The front-end and the backend are no longer open source.

59:42.520 --> 59:46.960
The front-end used to be open source and they decided to...

59:46.960 --> 59:47.960
Whack that.

59:47.960 --> 59:50.480
Basically hire someone to make it closed.

59:50.480 --> 59:58.080
Now the Plex backend for Kodi supports movie and TV shows and pictures and music.

59:58.080 --> 59:59.920
It automatically downloads the artwork.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.880
It does all the stuff that you'd expect including the transcoding and the streaming.

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:09.680
There's a few issues like when you toggle the view state of an item, you have to resync...

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.280
Kodi has to rescan the library before it sees that change on another Kodi box.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.760
But it seems like it's sort of the best if you're familiar with Plex, you get the management

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.500
of Plex that does seem to have pretty good metadata matching, at least in my experience

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:27.080
so far, at least for how I have my files named, with the Kodi front-end.

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.360
So that's something else I'm chewing on.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:36.440
If anybody out there has tried it, I'd love to hear your feedback, linuxactionshow.reddit.com

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.280
and let me know.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:43.920
Mr. Tonnell, or Dr. Tonnell over there, you're developing Kodi add-ons and things for Kodi.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.840
You must have a decent Kodi setup.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.840
Can you describe it a little bit?

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.840
How do you have it?

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.440
Are you just Samba server shares?

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.320
Are you accessing local files?

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.920
What's been your tried and true method to keep it working?

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.200
Yeah, basically a Samba server.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.720
Here's one of the nice things.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:04.360
The Plex Media and I think MB server backends support swapping out local file paths if you

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.360
turn it on.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.000
So you can turn on, when you click a file, instead of using the Plex HTTP path to the

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.400
file, you can have it use your Samba share in the background.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.560
So it'll do a file that way, which is really nice and fast.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.760
So that's sort of cool, too.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:23.880
I use Samba for the storing of the thing, but I use Raspberry Pi to push it to the server.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.720
So it'll open a leg on Raspberry Pi.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.520
Oh, that's great.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:34.920
There's also this thing, there's this adapter called the Flirrk, and that is so awesome.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.040
What is the Flirrk?

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:41.160
It's a little dongle that gives you a regular remote, like a TV remote.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.160
Oh, okay.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.800
There, I put it in the RC there.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.640
Will you drop that in the show notes, too, there?

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.640
Absolutely.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.840
So here's my really dumb Kodi 101 question.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:56.520
Is a shared back-end database the only way for me to have... Really, the only thing

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.560
I want, truly, is sync to watch status.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.840
I do like the idea of being able to remotely stream files, but that's secondary.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.960
What I really, really want is for the TVs to all see what files have been watched.

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:12.860
So if I'm watching Mr. Robot or Silicon Valley, which are my two shows I only watch, really,

01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:16.480
but when I watch those, I want to be able to watch them and have them marked as watched.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.840
Run downstairs, you hit play, and it's the same thing.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:26.520
And bearing in mind that I'm on both ends, I'm on an Android TV box, it seems like there's

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.800
a lot of effort, unless I want the remote streaming capabilities, it seems like there's

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.600
a lot of effort just to get sync to watch status across them.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.600
Yeah.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:34.600
Anyways, so...

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:41.040
I don't use the sync to watch status, so I mean, I just use the... I only have the one

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.040
device anyway.

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:45.800
Well, I have multiple devices for testing of making the multi-device work, but I only

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:49.360
have one that I care about, so I couldn't really help with that one.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:54.000
The other nice thing having a central back end would be if Kodi misidentifies something,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.280
I fix it in one spot.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.280
Yes, that's true.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:57.280
That is nice, too.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:02.960
Yeah, I've played with MB, and so far I like MB for the functionality, what you're talking

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.960
about.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.360
I haven't rolled it out in a big scale or anything, because I don't need it, but I have

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.080
played with it, and it seems to work as advertised.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.080
Yeah.

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.240
Yeah, I'll second that.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:21.680
My Kodi on Raspberry Pi 3 plus an MB server back end, and I was even able to stream 720p,

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:30.880
or have MB downsampled to 720p, and stream to a Raspberry Pi box at my dad's house 300

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:36.000
miles away over my Comcast internet with a 10 megabit upload.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.400
Hey, you know, that's pretty slick.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.400
From a Raspberry Pi?

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.400
Yeah, I love it.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.400
I'm really leaning...

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.400
There's so many options.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400
There's so many options.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400
It's awesome.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.920
The other thing it looks like with the MB back end, or to do the MB back end, and Wes,

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.040
maybe you could tell me if I'm wrong, but it looks like all they really have to do,

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.360
there's already an existing add-on.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:55.960
Yeah, you just install the add-on, configure it to point to your server.

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.520
Do I have... If I just go in Kodi, is it in the main list right there?

01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.520
I believe so.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:00.520
And then you just have...

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.520
It should be in the main list.

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.720
It's also created by the MB team.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.720
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:08.280
And that is also another reason why I really like that long term, and it gives you a GUI

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.200
where you put in the MB server info and stuff like that right there.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.480
And so I think when I'm working from an Android TV set top box, I don't feel like... I hate

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.480
Android's file system.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.480
I don't want to dig around on that.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.480
Exactly.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.480
It's a mess.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:20.480
So that's kind of appealing.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:24.520
Plus, MB is open source through and through, and it seems like that's a better match with

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.140
an open source media server.

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:31.040
And I think the MB back end also supports swapping out the local file paths, so I could

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.040
use my Samba shares.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.040
Yeah, totally.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:35.920
I'm getting really excited.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.800
It's been a long time since I've reevaluated how I do this.

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.800
I set this up.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:44.280
It's kind of a big decision, not because it's that important, but just because you really

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.600
aren't going to come back to it for a long time if it's working.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.600
So get it right.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.600
There's that.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.600
Once you set it up, you don't want to mess with it.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:55.360
And two, I am not mature enough as an adult to be over that embarrassment that I feel

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:58.900
when... So this happened this weekend.

01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:04.480
So this weekend, we were in Leavenworth, Washington with no internet connection.

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:12.680
And we have Plex on a set top box in the bedroom, and we have Plex on a set top box in the living

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.520
room of Lady Tubes.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.520
I use these terms loosely.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:22.360
And the living room, Nvidia Shield, has a Plex media server locally running on it.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.680
That's how I currently do this at home.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:30.560
And without an internet connection, the Plex front end in the bedroom can't just go out

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.560
and make the roundabout connection and play the local file.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.560
I don't know why.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.560
It's supposed to.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.560
It is supposed to.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.560
But it wouldn't.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.560
That's really annoying.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.560
And so there we are.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.840
And so I'm like, okay, let's watch the movie.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:44.400
But this is where Noah's voice is in the back of your head, and you're like, ugh.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.400
So then I'm like, okay.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.440
From now on, I'm just going to set this up, and I'm going to do local file paths, and

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.840
I'm done with this.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.840
Totally.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:55.320
So I think that's going to seal the deal on Envy, and then you just not have to worry

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.320
about it.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.920
Because when I do watch TV a couple of times a week, it's like my sort of unwind, relax.

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:03.880
I do it when I'm totally worn out, and there's nothing else more productive I'd be doing

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:04.880
anyways.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:05.880
I'm like, all right.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.880
Time to allow myself a little chill out time.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.880
Exactly.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.680
And to get frustrated when that thing just sits there and spins and spins and spins on

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:11.680
the screen.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.680
It's like, okay.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:15.560
So the other nice part about using Envy or Plex is you also then get Chromecast support

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:18.560
if you are somewhere where you're like, well, I really want to do this, but I don't have

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.560
my Kodi set up with me.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.560
But you have a Chromecast.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.560
Boom.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.560
Yeah.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.560
Hmm.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.560
I'm excited to set this all up again.

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:25.760
It's been a long time.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.760
And it makes my-

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.760
Actually-

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:28.760
Yeah, go ahead.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:29.760
Sorry about that.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:38.880
I'm actually looking at the Envy's plug-ins, and it actually has an Envy Kodi Sync Kuli

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:39.880
plug-in built in.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:40.880
Yeah.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.880
You can just install it.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.880
Yep.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.880
It goes right to it.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.880
Yeah, I know.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:45.880
It looks really straightforward.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.880
It looks like-

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.880
And then you're using two great open source projects together.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.880
Yeah.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:49.880
So it's just I have-

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:50.880
The only thing that's-

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.520
The only hesitation I have is I have had really great experience with Plex.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.800
I have a Plex Pass, and I have friends that I'm sharing my Plex libraries with already.

01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.800
And they're pretty good.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:02.320
I mean, for being partially proprietary, they're pretty good.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.800
I mean, they employ that MPV developer.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:04.800
That's true.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.800
I mean, they seem like good citizens.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.800
Yeah.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.800
And they have kicked up some upstream code.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.800
So that's-

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:09.800
Yeah.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:10.800
That is-

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.800
But they're not Envy, though.

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.800
But they're not Envy.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.800
Right.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:14.800
We live in interesting times, Chris.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.800
Yeah.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.800
I know.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:17.800
I know it doesn't-

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.800
For me, I'm not trying-

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.800
This is not some big problem I'm trying to solve.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.040
It's a fun challenge to get to relook at my home storage and now try to do it in a way

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.520
that's mobile and low power.

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.080
You get to play architect, sysadmin.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.080
All these things.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:33.680
You try to do it in a way that's going to be like long-lasting, sustainable, low maintenance.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:34.680
Low maintenance.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.680
Yes.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.680
And that's the trick.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.560
And that's the perfect trifecta if you can pull it off.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.320
And that's exactly what you want for your home media system.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:48.660
And the thing that I think that really has me fired up about it is just spending a couple

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:54.080
of months in Kodi using local files on the NVIDIA Shield, I have just grown such a new

01:07:54.080 --> 01:07:58.200
appreciation for this open source project that that is-

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.640
It's been going for so long and it's very polished.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:05.400
And it's like, I really respect some of the decisions they've made recently because I

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.840
think they're really following some interesting trends and there's more and more better hardware

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.840
out there all the time.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:10.840
Yes.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.240
And then it feels like if this is something I can really get my head around, then down

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:16.440
the road I can start experimenting with Raspberry Pis running.

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:17.440
Exactly.

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.440
Yeah.

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:19.440
And then it's like-

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.480
Especially with all those things Wimpy was telling us about compiling with better video

01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.480
support.

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.480
Yeah, exactly.

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.880
And I think what makes me think about that is it's a really easy, sustainable, long-term

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:30.400
way when like a family member wants something like this after they check out.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:32.000
Add them right into your network.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.280
Yes, exactly.

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:38.480
So it could be really nice and it could be a really fun, sustainable home project.

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.320
So I'll give you guys an update when I actually put it all together.

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.640
I'm going to start experimenting with stuff over the next few weeks and then figure out

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.440
how I'm doing the backend storage.

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.360
And then we'll actually probably have to figure that out sooner than later, really.

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:51.320
And then I got to rename all the media.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.320
But it's a good problem.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.320
It's a good problem to have.

01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.320
I'm looking forward to it.

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.480
And we have links to all bunch of stuff in the show notes if you guys want to check it

01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.480
out.

01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:00.280
And if you have any experience in this area, I would love to hear it.

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.280
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.280
Go chime in.

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.280
Go chime in.

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.000
There's never too many cooks in this kitchen.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.880
No, I've been getting mixed responses, but I've been getting mixed responses.

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:15.960
Some people are, yeah.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:18.040
But a lot of folks have been very helpful.

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.340
So it's really cool.

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:20.340
And it's pretty exciting.

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:23.280
Be all end all, we're very excited about all these open source projects.

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:30.520
It's neat to rediscover and re-embrace something that I've observed but haven't really fully

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:31.520
dived into for a long time.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.520
Right, exactly.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.120
That's sort of a fun aspect of it as well.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:35.120
Cool it is.

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.920
All right, that brings us to the end of at least the official part of this week's show.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.840
Episode 156 wraps up.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:45.800
We love your feedback, your responses, your topic ideas at LinuxActionShow.reddit.com.

Your feedback also is welcome at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.680
And a huge part of this show is our virtual log and our live chat room.

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.160
Find out our lifetimes at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:02.000
And then just head over to jblive.tv during that lifetime, which is 2 p.m. Pacific.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.200
And hang out in the chat room, our do-bag mumble, and get the mumble server info.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.120
Just join us any way you can.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.120
Absolutely.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.840
Man, I can't wait till next week.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:30.120
See you right back here next Tuesday.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:50.040
You know, in some ways, I feel like the whole media center topic has been done over and

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:51.360
over and over again.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:56.080
But in other ways, I feel like it's sort of re-energized in the sense that there is cooler

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.840
hardware available than we've ever had.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.880
This way, like the stuff is getting, the embedded stuff is getting powerful enough to actually

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:01.880
do this.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:02.880
I feel like ARM's coming up.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.360
Intel's getting cheaper and smaller.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.480
It's like there's a lot of those middle range devices.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.200
And on the back end, like hard drives are getting big for cheap.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.880
I think, what is it, Seagate now has a 10 terabyte hard drive you can buy.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.680
And which means, what that really means is their 8 terabyte hard drives are now completely

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680
reasonable in price.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.680
Yes, exactly, right.

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.240
Eight terabytes in a single drive.

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.240
You know, you put three of those.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.240
That's a lot of Star Trek.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.240
Woo!

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.240
Yeah, exactly.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:30.800
So there's like this confluence of super well-priced, really powerful front-end hardware.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:35.880
And an abundance of free software that you can just use it to manage all.

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.940
At all levels.

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:41.120
From getting this content automatically off the internet, from backing it up off your

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.480
own optical media, to managing it.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:50.400
And then, on top of it, the seamless integration now with things like YouTube and Torrance

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.360
and all this stuff that makes online media at the same level as all the other stuff.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.280
Everything's on the same level playing field.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.000
And Kodi is in a perfect intersection of all that stuff with the hard drive.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000
It's just, I love it.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.600
I'm really excited about it.

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:07.360
I just linked a super sexy case from the Flirk team.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.360
That is really nice.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.360
Check this out.

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.360
I saw that.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.360
I think I saw it.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.360
Maybe linked on the Kodi main site.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.360
Oh, I might have to pick that up.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.360
I can't remember where I saw this.

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:17.960
Yeah, they had a deal, the Flirk and Kodi made a deal to make their own Kodi version

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:18.960
of this.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:19.960
Okay.

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.960
Oh, nice.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.960
Yeah.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.960
Doesn't that look really nice?

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:23.960
Wow.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:27.960
Like, legitimately, I could see like when Angela's like, okay, I'm ready to replace these Rokus,

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.600
I would totally go with this.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:32.360
See that's perfect because I have that NUC of my parents' house that's also their like

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:35.040
router and it's, you know, it's playing a lot of roles for them, but I can just, I have

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:38.080
a pie sitting around, buy one of these, stick it in their bedroom upstairs.

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.400
Now they have both TVs connected to my chair.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.880
You know, I wonder if Noah's going to start working with some of this stuff too.

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:43.880
I know.

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:44.880
Because he does some displays too.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:45.880
Exactly.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.880
Nice rotten corpse.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.880
Yeah.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:48.880
Thanks for mentioning that because I'd forgotten about that.

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.040
And it's 15 bucks and your money's going to a great deal.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:53.840
Anytime I feel like you're buying from this ecosystem, that's going to a good cause.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:13:00.720
And specifically since Chris mentioned on last that the Nvidia Shield was just so responsive,

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:06.520
I noticed a huge bump upgrading from Raspberry Pi 2 to Raspberry Pi 3 when using Kodi.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.520
Hmm.

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.520
Yeah.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:09.520
I believe that.

01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.920
I should make mention that on playback, when watching my review of the Shield, Plex actually

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.560
started the file right away, but the video file I just happened to chose had like two

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:21.140
seconds of black.

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:25.740
So somebody on YouTube was like, um, hey, and I watched it back and I'm like, oh yeah.

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:31.360
So it actually, the Nvidia Shield is just wicked fast, period.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.200
And I mean that on like every level.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.000
Like Netflix is, obviously that's going to be fast, it's a simple app, but like Borderlands

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
2 launches instantly.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Wow.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.200
It's really, it's really powerful.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.480
And Noah's box is cheaper and I like that.

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.400
And then the Raspberry Pi's are even another route to go.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.840
So who am I to say which one you should go with?

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.880
But at each level there's great options.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:54.000
And I can't even want to build a full PC over here in the studio too, just to have fun with

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
that.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.920
But you know, I do have that Pi sitting around, so if you want to try it as an end point to

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:02.600
whatever solution you go to, I would be happy to set that up.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.600
Love you, Wes.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.440
What were you going to say, Noah?

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:10.280
I have a Pi B Plus that actually runs Kodi.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:17.000
It's not the fastest solution, but it does work pretty well, especially if you're only

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.560
doing like 720p and lower.

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.120
It runs like a champ.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.120
Yeah.

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.360
I mean, almost all the TV shows I get are 720p or lower.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.880
North Ranger, were you going to say something, but we kept cutting you off here?

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:29.880
Oh, yeah.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:35.520
I can't remember if I saw this on the big rundown on last two that some of these Android

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:39.760
TV boxes are really the only ones that you can do reliable 4K streaming yet for people

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.360
that are jumping on the 4K TV bandwidth.

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.360
That is true.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.360
Yeah.

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:48.840
You know, and I don't have a 4K TV, so I just mentioned it in the specs, but not only does

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:55.680
the Shield support 4K video, but it also supports UHD 4K, and I'll tell you, I am more excited

01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.520
about UHD 4K than I am 3D because what UHD, basically, if my understanding is correct,

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:07.080
and it might not be, but my understanding is that UHD is essentially HDR 4K video.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:10.360
So like it's 4K video with HDR exposure.

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:12.560
The spec you want to look for is UHD Plus.

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.560
Right.

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.560
Yeah.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.560
Okay.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.560
Thanks.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.560
Yeah.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.560
And that, I cannot wait.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:24.120
It does not compel me, but 4K UHD Plus, yeah, that's got me.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:30.880
So Chris, what are you thinking for storage hardware, especially in the RV, and aren't

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.800
you worried about heat?

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:33.800
Big time.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:38.160
Yeah, I really am because it's going to be in a dinette booth underneath the booth, closed

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.160
up.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.120
I'm already worried about heat with just the cradle point and the Wi-Fi, and I have a cell

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.160
booster in there right now.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:49.960
So I don't know, I have pledged to make it Linux.

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:50.960
That's what I know.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:51.960
Okay.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:58.240
Which has eliminated FreeNAS from the running, which is a little disappointing because I

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:01.800
could use the FreeNAS plug-ins to accomplish some of the stuff I want because I don't want

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.280
to run more than one device.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.280
Right.

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:05.440
Just because of the power issues.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.440
So these are running on-

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.760
It simplifies everything if you just have the one.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.260
All of this stuff is going to be running off an inverter, which also powers my fridge and

01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:13.460
two other TVs.

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:16.820
So there's not – I don't know how much overhead this thing has, but this inverter

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:20.720
probably only has like another thousand watts to give.

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:26.040
So I got to make sure that I really – I got to make sure that I am very power conscious

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.360
about what I choose.

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.080
So whatever I implement, I think I'm going to need the support of – I got to be able

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.080
to virtualize.

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.080
Yeah, totally.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:40.000
So I think – so I am really trying not to do a NUC with Linux on it that's just connected

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.520
to some disk, but that seems like a possibility to me.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:49.640
But what I really want to do is I would really like to have something like FreeNAS that is

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:50.640
Linux-based.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:57.000
But eventually, I'm going to put – I have three booth dinette seats to work with.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.840
So I'm going to spread things out amongst the dinette seats to spread out the heat,

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.380
and that is one thing I'll be doing.

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:10.320
And then I want to have a shit ton of storage so I can consolidate all of my media that

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:14.980
I store here at the studio and all of my media that I store at Angela's house, which is

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:19.400
about two terabytes here at the studio and about 12 terabytes at Angela's house.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:24.800
I want to consolidate all of that into my own file server so I can get off their file

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:25.800
servers.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:30.220
The studio's file server shouldn't be housing some of my personal media.

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:31.600
So get that off there.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:35.280
Get it off Angela's house server so that way she can put more of her own stuff on there,

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.360
like whatever she wants to watch.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.640
And then I want to have enough left over to run virtual machines and enough left over

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:48.220
to store video content and audio content that I record on the road when I'm, like, doing

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:49.220
rover logs or shows.

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:50.220
I want to have a local backup.

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:52.280
A nice working set that you can have all the time.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.280
Yeah.

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:57.880
And how to do all of that without generating a crap ton of heat or a crap ton of maintenance.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:04.320
And something that is super reliable because when I'm on the road, I've got a million

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.320
things to worry about.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.320
And –

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.320
You need it to just work.

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.320
Yeah.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:09.320
So that's my challenge.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.320
Yeah.

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.320
Go ahead.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.320
Whack walk.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.320
Whack work.

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.320
Whack work.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.320
Whack work.

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.420
I like that we have muhahaha in there too.

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:19.500
So that is my goal.

01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:21.680
That is where – that is what I'm aiming for.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.580
And I will – whatever I end up – whatever solution I build, I'll probably record it

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:30.280
all as I build it up and set it up and then do an episode of Last About It or something.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.120
So whatever I end up doing, whatever – however I try to solve all these things –

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.120
Stay tuned.

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.120
Yeah.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.120
Stay tuned and find out.

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.120
All right.

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:40.640
I have a little conspiracy bacon to fry that's not really Linux related.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.720
It's actually Apple related.

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:45.360
But it might result in more Linux users.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.360
So –

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.360
Hey.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.360
You want to fry a little conspiracy bacon with me?

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.360
Yes.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.360
Let's do it.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.360
Mmm.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.360
Smells good in here.

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:54.540
So if you follow any of the Apple blogs or Scuttlebutt or whatever, I mean they're just

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:56.080
all over the internet.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:00.300
Apple users are belly aching about how old Mac hardware is, right?

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.320
It's like super ancient now.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.960
With the exception of like a couple of Mac devices, they basically are – some of the

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:09.240
machines are running three-year-old hardware and they're still charging the same exact

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:14.280
price they did when they shipped it, like the Mac Pro or some of the MacBook line.

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.800
And I've been wondering like what are they doing?

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:16.800
Are they crazy?

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.840
And then today this new Apple commercial went online.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:21.840
Have you seen this?

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:22.840
I have not.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.280
It's called iPad Pro, what is a computer?

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.760
Now I can't play all of the audio because I'm sure even though it's a commercial I'll

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:28.760
get taken down for playing it.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:29.760
Well of course, Chris.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:35.000
And a screen you can touch and even write on.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:40.080
So the whole ad is the premise around rethink what a computer is.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.140
Don't assume that it's just for content consumption.

01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:44.920
This is the new iPad.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:48.560
Imagine what your computer could do if your computer was an iPad Pro.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.560
So here's my conspiracy.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.560
Are you ready?

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.560
Oh yeah.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:57.360
So Apple is intentionally slowing down the MacBook and the Mac line in general to try

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.720
to get their consumer base to switch over.

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:00.720
Rev up on the iPads.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:01.720
Yeah.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.720
Yeah.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.480
To be like, let's buy iPads instead because they feel like they can't really, you know,

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:08.360
there's not like that Mac business isn't going to go, it's just sort of what it's been

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:09.360
forever.

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.360
Yeah.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.360
Do you think that could be what it is?

01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.200
Could it be the grand Apple conspiracy to get everybody on iPads?

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:17.120
I mean it is their beautiful walled garden environment.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.120
I could see it.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:22.120
It's up to you to decide, dear audience.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.120
Who knows?

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:24.120
Makes sense to me.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:28.200
Everyone will have services and iPads and only us weirdo Linux users will be left on

01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.200
the desktop.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.200
Yeah.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.200
Yeah.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.200
Oh.

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:34.400
Maybe it's better that way.

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:37.640
Then people who want to make desktop apps will have to come to us and we'll by then

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:41.040
we'll have decided on the one true packaging format so it'll be fine.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.040
Oh, we've already decided.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.040
We're going to talk about it in the show today.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:44.040
Oh great.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.040
Yeah.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:50.240
We're going to talk about Apple's margins on their A9, A10, and A11, all their in-house

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:52.520
chip sets compared to Intel.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.520
Sure.

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:58.240
Especially since they can build that one chip and use it across three mobile devices.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:15.480
The margins on that have got to be pretty smart.
