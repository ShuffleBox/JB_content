1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Who says you can't have fun in your terminal? Wes found SSHtron. Multiplayer Tron in your

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,320
terminal. That's awesome. You just SSH to SSHtron.ZackLotta.com. We'll have a link in

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,320
the show notes.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,320
Oh yeah.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,480
And you can play Multiplayer Tron in your terminal window. I love it, Wes. Good find.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,040
SSHtron for the win. That's it right there.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,400
You didn't even know it was missing from your life, but it was.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,400
Show's over. We're done.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,920
Yeah, we're just going to be busy playing this, so entertain yourselves.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:46,360
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 231 for January 9th, 2018.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's ready to kill the Gen 2 challenge

12
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,320
in its face.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
My name is Chris.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
My name is Wes.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,320
This should be it right here. This should be the final Gen 2 challenge episode, but

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,160
we'll have to wait and see, because first we have to get through a packed show. Yes,

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,780
my friends, 2018 is starting off with a bang. We'll give you a snapshot on where Linux is

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,880
specifically with Meltdown and Spectre. Then we'll get into a couple of new releases that

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:22,000
might be some of the best open source software you're not using. It's great. Then, I say

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,740
the perfect Linux workstation is Ni. The absolute perfect desktop to run Linux is Ni, and it's

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,680
well under $1,000. We'll talk about that. Plus, our friends over at elementary have

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,080
a new app, looking pretty good. Then the register says buckle up. It's going to be the year

23
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,120
of Gnome, and it's going to be the year of Ubuntu. They got a couple of notes on how

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,480
it's going to just be a blowout year. We'll talk about that whole Lenovo firmware bug

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,360
that cropped up while we were off the air. We'll touch on that. Then, Telegram's got

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:09,220
a cryptocurrency. Then, Wes, it's back. Linspire returns. Our old friend. The old Linspire.

27
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,520
Remember Lindos, then Linspire? Remember Xandros? Yeah. They've only been merged together and

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:24,440
relaunched. Linspire 7.0 launched this week, and I paid the $80 license fee to download

29
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
it-

30
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
You got your hands on it.

31
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
... and give it a shot.

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Look at you.

33
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,480
I bought it so you don't have to, because you can't just download Linspire. No, no.

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,320
You have to buy a $79 license, which includes an install media, which works out to be $94,

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
all told.

36
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,640
The things you do for the audience.

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:48,440
I'll give you my take on the new Linspire. I went into it with a bit of a bias, like

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:57,400
$95, $95, and then I started to use it. It might be the best XFCE desktop I've ever used.

39
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,560
Hey, boy. Wow.

40
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,800
I don't know. It's early days, but it blew me away. If I could get it installed and running,

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,600
it'd really impress me. We'll tell you more about that. Then, towards the end of the show,

42
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:19,800
at least, my God, I hope, Wes, it is the final chapter of the Gen 2 Challenge.

43
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,040
Well, yeah, we're switching everything over to Linspire. Gen 2 was 2017, so, Wes.

44
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,680
The most hated segment of all time. But you know what? Damned if we didn't actually get

45
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,000
a little morsel out of this segment. Wes and I were talking about it before the show, and

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
we genuinely walked away with a lesson. What the hell is Gen 2 for? What good is Gen 2

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,280
for? What's its place in 2018 in Linux? I think we figured it out, and I think it's

48
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,240
extremely important. In fact, I think it's sort of as important as Linux itself is. We'll

49
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,240
talk about that, and we'll hopefully wrap up the Gen 2 Challenge.

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,800
But before we go even a moment further, we've got to say hola to our virtual log. Time-appropriate

51
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:11,400
greetings, Mumble Room. Hello. Hello. Happy New Year's, everybody. Take a moment from

52
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,500
playing SSH Tron, and let's update everybody on Meltdown and Spectre. You and Beard touched

53
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,320
on this last week, because it was sort of like this awkward, there's something coming.

54
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,200
The pre-release, yeah. Really, it wasn't supposed to be announced until today. Today was the

55
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,280
day the embargo was supposed to be lifted, and today was actually the day we were supposed

56
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,480
to learn about Meltdown and Spectre. In a different universe. Yeah. So we have some

57
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,040
great coverage coming out of JB. I'll just say that right now. Later today, the Ask Noah

58
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,640
program is doing a special on Meltdown and Spectre, and Noah is bringing on Brandon Johnson

59
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,960
from Red Hat to talk about their work with it, which I think is going to be an extremely

60
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,800
interesting insight. And then later in the week, Wes and I are doing a hell of a roundup

61
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,080
on Meltdown and Spectre. There's still a big part of the story that hasn't been told. We're

62
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,080
going to have a complete timeline, a concise timeline of how everything went down. Lots

63
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,320
of interesting tidbits there. So there's more coverage to come. So with that said, just

64
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,640
a quick state of the union for Linux as we record this episode. In brief, Meltdown is

65
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,340
a CPU vulnerability. It works by using modern processors out of order execution to read

66
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:31,400
arbitrary kernel memory location, which could include personal data like passwords, SSL

67
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,680
key information. And then there's Spectre, a second issue. Spectre breaks down the barriers

68
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,680
between different applications. So you could theoretically use it to trick applications

69
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,840
into accessing arbitrary programs, not kernel, but arbitrary program memory locations. Spectre

70
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,640
is harder to exploit than Meltdown, but it's also harder to mitigate. It's more of like

71
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,520
a design issue. So it's going to be something we'll be hearing more about through 2018.

72
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,440
There's probably going to be more patches coming upstream from Linux. So it's probably

73
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,800
just the beginning of this story. As far as Meltdown is concerned, this is where we have

74
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,160
some of the most traction with patches. Work is continuing though. The latest updates of

75
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,520
the upstream stable Linux kernel 4.14.2 have current patches. Some people may experience

76
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,560
boot problems with this release, however, so don't jump to get it. 4.14.13 will be out

77
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:30,160
in just a few days. And patches have also been added to the old 4.4 and 4.9 stable kernel

78
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
trees.

79
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,880
Yeah, I've seen a lot of questions expressed about those backports though. So if security

80
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,200
is really your concern, it'll probably be best to have the most recent kernel available.

81
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,260
Yeah. And Greg Cage has sort of been advising that and 4.14 and 4.15 are getting those.

82
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:52,560
There's still a lot of things that are happening. And it's obvious that the kernel team had

83
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,920
more time to prep for Meltdown than they did Spectre. It's a totally different story. There's

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:03,240
really no official like blessed Greg KH Linus Spectre patches at this point. There's different

85
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:11,480
distributions that have solutions, but there's nothing that's been blessed by upstream yet.

86
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,800
It's really all still shaken out.

87
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,440
Yeah, yeah. I've been seeing Red Hat issue kernel updates for the two series Linux kernel.

88
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,440
Oh boy.

89
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,440
Yeah. Canonical has been updating people on the status of their patches for Ubuntu, same

90
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,880
with other distributions. And there's been reports of performance impacts on certain

91
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,920
workloads, specifically cloud workloads that have a lot of say disk and network IO.

92
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,440
And where security is particularly important.

93
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,360
And that's sort of going to be the big story. Don't you think bashful long term?

94
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:52,280
Absolutely. There's some people that are reporting up to 40% CPU spikes. And there's a ton of

95
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,520
stuff where when they have auto scaling set on for something like Amazon or whatever,

96
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,160
and then also their bills are just bouncing way up because what used to be an adequate

97
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,580
workload for what they had deployed is now auto scaling up and they're getting hammered

98
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,580
with the bills.

99
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:13,920
Yeah, yeah. And we, I think we'll probably talk more about this on TechSnap and get deeper

100
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,160
into that or on Coder Radio maybe too. I was thinking about it, but this is going to really

101
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,840
impact the Jupyter broadcasting development audience.

102
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,360
And you know, really, it's no fun for anyone, especially when you when you go into something

103
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,120
like cloud computing. So that way you can budget like a certain set cost. And then all

104
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,280
of a sudden, like you got to have a bar. Yeah. So we'll get more into that later. But I also

105
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,040
wanted to say if you've been speculating, I know this affects all kinds of different

106
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,320
processors. What about GPUs? The answer is, yeah, yeah. Nvidia graphics drivers have been

107
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,400
updated to address vulnerabilities. In the show notes, we have linked a Ubuntu security

108
00:08:52,400 --> 00:09:00,360
notice that covers 1710, 1704, 1604 and 1404. And it's the same thing. Jan Horn discovered

109
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,540
that microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and branch prediction may allow

110
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,280
unauthorized memory reads via side channel attacks. And guess what? Nvidia's GPUs take

111
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,000
advantage of that little trick as well. So you got to get fast. I mean, yeah, yeah. You

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,400
got to get Nvidia driver 384.111 to get that fix on Ubuntu. Good to know. Yeah. So there

113
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:25,760
is oh, and then also there's news today or yesterday that but it's been updated today

114
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:33,280
that Microsoft has halted the meltdown inspector patches for Windows 10 after AMD machines

115
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,840
were reported as unbootable.

116
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,120
Yeah, it seems like there's a lot of difficult patches. And as always, it's a, you know,

117
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,460
patching is sometimes it's true. Sometimes it's like, okay, two packages got upgraded.

118
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,660
But especially when it's your kernel, you got to be careful.

119
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,040
It's interesting that Microsoft can really turn the dial on this one. So they can just

120
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,840
go, all right, well, we're going to continue pushing patches, but not for machines with

121
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,600
AMD processors. Like they can get really granular on what client machines receive updates. They

122
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,760
have a very tight control.

123
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,800
Yeah, cloud connectivity, Chris.

124
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,560
Oh, oh, oh. So yeah, not a good day for our Windows users either. Ask Noah, if you're

125
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,080
on the live stream comes on right after Linux unplugged. Now, we're doing like a Linux blowout

126
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,080
afternoon.

127
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,400
It's perfect. You just sit down in the afternoon, hang out with us for a couple of hours and

128
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
have a great time.

129
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,880
That crazy guy's working on integrating mumble with the phone call system too. So you can

130
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,880
hang on. Yeah, join the virtual lug during the show. And then you just hang tight. And

131
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,280
you can participate in Ask Noah right with your same mumble setup. And so yeah, he'll

132
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:38,040
be taking calls and be discussing Spectre and Meltdown with his guests. So that'll be

133
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
coming up more.

134
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,640
I think go over to TechSnap.Systems and subscribe to our feed there because I have a suspicion

135
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,080
that this is a story that is just beginning and there's going to be a waning period where

136
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,880
people sort of get tired of it. But what we're going to do with, I would suspect, what we

137
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,720
always do with TechSnap is we continue to monitor story and find interesting nuggets

138
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,520
that maybe aren't getting reported on very much and just continue to follow it for a

139
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
while.

140
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,240
Three, six, nine months, pieces of this are going to be popping up.

141
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,160
Yeah, exactly. So we'll probably, long term, you'll probably see a lot of coverage there.

142
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,040
Now, anybody in the mumble room want to talk about this big story before we move on? Oh,

143
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,880
Batchful, you said you had some crashes at work. I didn't see that.

144
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,240
Yeah, a couple of the guys are doing some testing for our internal stuff. And there's

145
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,760
like a reg file that you actually have to import. And they've now said, don't do it

146
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,240
because we started getting a bunch of systems dropping out due to that. So now we're waiting.

147
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,800
We had to go and pull it back out. And now it's just a wait and see thing.

148
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,080
Yeah. Yeah, I have a sense that, you know, and it's unfortunate there's not only the

149
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,520
performance issues, but there's apparently some stability issues and other side effects.

150
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:57,160
And at the same time, you know that there has been developers and other people that

151
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,320
have just been working their butts off to get this stuff out in time, especially when

152
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,000
it was disclosed earlier than it should have been. So you got to take them up and say thank

153
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,760
you to these people, these unnamed faceless people who were working over the holidays,

154
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,040
working through Christmas and New Year's to try to get this stuff together. And it might

155
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,680
not be perfect yet. But my God, where would we be without them?

156
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,320
Right. It's definitely a scramble. And there are people doing the scrambling.

157
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,400
Yeah. So you got to in one moment, you got to go, okay, thank you, guys. Appreciate the

158
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,800
hard work you're doing out there.

159
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,480
It really just it just sucks. We did CPUs wrong.

160
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Everything is ruined.

161
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,960
We all have to pay.

162
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,360
It's all bad. We're actually it's funny. We're gonna get back to that in a moment. We're

163
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,400
gonna go back to the good old days before processors were broken. But before we go there,

164
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,280
I want to give a shout out to two open source projects that I bet you're not using that

165
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:50,000
you really should be. And I'm guilty of this myself. So I may be projecting. But first

166
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,720
project that had an update since last episode is Shotcut, a really good video editor on

167
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,160
Linux. It's I don't understand why we don't talk about it. It has one of the features

168
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:08,280
that Rekai and I like the most in Final Cut 10, which is it renders preview stills and

169
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,760
waveforms in line with your media. So it's all together and it makes it easy to skim

170
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:19,080
and preview. Yeah. And it's got good performance. And they just added a feature that I am particularly

171
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:26,480
interested in. It's an audio spectrum visualization filter, which we use for a lot of our audio

172
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,280
only shows. And we use a series of Python scripts and whatnot. But this may be a way

173
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,760
to do one offs in a new and interesting way. So Shotcut just had a new update just a couple

174
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,920
of days ago. It's released 18.01. And it just it's I think maybe the best open source video

175
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,840
editor you're not using. And it doesn't have as much hype as some of the other ones. But

176
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:56,160
it's just been so steadily awesome. So Shotcut, shotcut.org for that. And then I know you're

177
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,360
not using this one because y'all keep talking about Evernote replacements and killers. And

178
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,120
the reality is, we've had an Evernote killer for for ages now. It's even been an app pick

179
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,120
on the Linux action show. Oh, yeah, I remember that. And it just got even better. So just

180
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,920
a couple of days ago, an interesting naming scheme again, 18.01.1 of qownotes has been

181
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,320
replaced. Now this is a plain text notepad with markdown support and own cloud slash

182
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,540
next cloud syncing integration. And one of the things they've recently added that I'm

183
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:35,240
all on board with, and it's it is a full featured really well done application. Don't let the

184
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:40,120
queue throw you off. If you're like a gnome desktop or a unity user or whatever. It is

185
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,640
it is great. It is a well designed cute application. But one of the things that they've added recently

186
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,860
that I really appreciate is they've you've always been able to kind of create like to

187
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,240
do lists and whatnot. But now you've actually got the ability to check items off in your

188
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,280
notes. So you can create a list of these are the things I've got to do today. And then

189
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,200
when you're done, you can go in there and check them off. That's awesome. It's a simple

190
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,120
thing, but it makes such a difference for my note taking application. I use the share

191
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,720
of this for like, about to hit the road and I need to do a checklist of all the stuff

192
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,980
I got to bring all the equipment we got to bring to go do like a live show. So useful.

193
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,440
And the fact that you can then sync on the back end with different open source solutions.

194
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,720
You can do small little like note windows that just take up tiny bits of space. Or you

195
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,480
can do like a full featured thing that allows you browse your tags and your your different

196
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,320
categories and has multi column live preview of the markdown like you can go all out or

197
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,720
you can just have it be this tiny little window on your desktop. It's one of my favorite cute

198
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,600
applications for Linux. It's a it is better than an Evernote replacement because it's

199
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,700
using markdown. It uses next cloud. And I don't know I don't know why we don't talk

200
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,960
about it more. So I just thought since they had a new release, they just pumped out a

201
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,600
new version that now lets you check things off. It's time to install that just right

202
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,600
now because that's half of what I would do. Right? Yeah, that's a that's a great app pick.

203
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,040
I've been looking for a placement for Zim Wiki for a long time. Yeah, I think this is

204
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,600
it. Yeah, this looks terrific. Yeah, I've even been wondering if we couldn't use this

205
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:09,120
for production of our shows instead of using slack and Google Docs or whatever else. Seems

206
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,200
like this is just got a lot of potential. So I think 2018 may be the year of QO notes

207
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,920
for me. I have to give some love to my next cloud instance first. Plus, there's a new

208
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,360
version of next cloud that's just around the corner. So I may let that land first and then

209
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,840
do this. But I feel like it's fair. I feel like it's happening. Apparently, you can also

210
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:36,120
import from Evernote to QO notes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So stop talking about Evernote alternatives,

211
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,600
because QO notes has been here for a while. And they got the new update 1801 dot one,

212
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:49,480
which just came out. And I love it. I think there's tools like that, that we like we don't

213
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,720
really fully like wrap our head around yet that are that make Linux competitive desktop.

214
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,600
But you got to have great hardware, too. Yeah, oh, yeah. It's not just about like getting

215
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,560
a great LTS release or getting a great rolling release and getting your favorite desktop.

216
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:12,240
You also need to run it on the best hardware possible. And we've all we've all seen different

217
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,120
different different solutions for like the ultimate Linux workstation ones you build

218
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,000
yourself. Dell just recently updated the XPS 13, which looks like a killer laptop. I thought

219
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,080
you're supposed to use a Raspberry Pi. And that was that was the end of the story. Is

220
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,480
that not you're telling me that we can do more? Oh, well, well, there's a machine on

221
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,520
the horizon that wimpy and I have been talking about to each other offline for ages now.

222
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:41,760
And we finally with CES in full swing, have details on what I think is going to be 2018

223
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:49,080
perfect Linux desktop. And it's a NUC. It's the Intel Hades Canyon NUC with the dedicated

224
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:55,360
quote unquote, Radeon graphics that comes on the Intel CPU. Oh, and then you combine

225
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,960
that with Thunderbolt three ports, super fast disk, the latest Intel processors. Wimpy,

226
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,840
what do you think? This has got to be the desktop of the year, right?

227
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,920
I'm really hoping so. And I'm going to find out by buying one the day they say I'm very

228
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,720
tempted to. It's a weird situation to be in. So we talked about this a little bit on user

229
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,000
error, Episode 40. I've been following I've been tracking the the rumors about this device

230
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
for some months now. I have its predecessor. So this is I have the Skull Canyon NUC. And

231
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,280
I'm in a weird position where I've been so happy with the Skull Canyon NUC. I've been

232
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,980
pining for its replacement almost since I got it because I was like, if this is so good,

233
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,720
what's the next one going to be like? And here it is. We've now seen it announced CES

234
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,080
2018.

235
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
And are you satisfied?

236
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,880
Yes, I mean, there is there is nothing about this specification of this device that I'm

237
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,040
unhappy about. I'm really looking forward to getting one. Yeah, yeah. I don't find it

238
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,320
wanting if I was going to be really nitpicky. The only thing I would say is I can't upgrade

239
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,800
it to 64 gigs of RAM, I can only go to 32. Which is what I have in the current NUC. But

240
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,520
then the flip side of that is when I get this one, I will just be able to pop my old one

241
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:30,460
open, remove the two M2 SSDs, remove the RAM, plug them into the new one, plug my Razer

242
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,960
core into one of the Thunderbolt ports and power it on and I'm back in business on a

243
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,280
whole new hardware platform. Yeah, that's you know, almost instantly.

244
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Yeah. The one other thing I would have asked for is two is because it has one Thunderbolt

245
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,680
three bus, two Thunderbolt three buses, like maybe four USB-C type would have been amazing.

246
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,960
I do like this. Yeah, that's true. And if I put my storage over Ethernet instead of

247
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,560
over Thunderbolt, then that's probably fine. There's six display options on this right

248
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,880
because it's two Thunderbolt three, there's two mini DVI, sorry mini DisplayPort and there's

249
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:16,880
two HDMI. The HDMI are both HDMI 2.0A with HDCP 2.2. I mean, it's absolutely spec'd to

250
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,480
the max. Oh, there is a third USB-C port on the front of it. So there is technically three

251
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,880
USB-C ports. It's just one Thunderbolt three bus.

252
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:33,280
There's also internal headers for USB ports. Really? Yeah, it's totally tripped. I really

253
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,840
love it. It's a bit fatter than the one that I have. But then again, the skull on the new

254
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:45,960
one is illuminated with red and blue LEDs. So you know, you can't really go wrong. Yeah,

255
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,600
yeah, it's it's still smaller than a Mac Mini. I think the thing I want to see is power V

256
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:59,640
USB-C. Yeah, that's just too much of a machine for that, though. I think it takes this machine

257
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:09,840
draws 6.32 amps. With similar capacities that do it? Yeah, maybe. Maybe. I don't know. 6

258
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,240
amps is... Maybe for the lower power model, the 65 watt model, you might be able to power

259
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,640
over USB-C. But the larger one that's 100 watt, I don't think you can do over USB-C.

260
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,800
Yeah, I can't imagine. Certainly my USB-C charger is all capped at like 65 watts, I

261
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,940
think. I'm just reading. I'm reading the specs. It's 120 watt adapter, 19 volts at 16.32 amps

262
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:38,120
is what the specs are for it. Man, I really like this thing. So the and so not only is

263
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,400
it tiny, but it's quiet too, right? Yours is pretty quiet, Wimpy. Yeah, my my NUC is

264
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,560
quiet. Obviously, my 1080 Ti in a Razer Core is a little bit louder. Yeah, but thankfully

265
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:56,620
through the magic of directional microphones, you can't hear it. But you have the ability

266
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:02,240
to dynamically switch between the external GPU in the Razer Core and the internal Intel

267
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,040
GPU, correct? Yes. In fact, up until two days ago, that's how I was running things. So when

268
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:14,920
we spoke about this a few weeks ago, I had one of my monitors exclusively powered by

269
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:25,880
the IGP in the NUC and the other monitor exclusively powered by the 1080 Ti in the Razer Core.

270
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,440
And the acceleration was on one monitor with the 1080 Ti. And I could, it's a seamless

271
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,640
X session. There's a little bit of magic in the way you need to set this up. But I can

272
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,560
drag windows between the two monitors and you can watch the 3D performance drop off

273
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:49,120
as you drag it from the Nvidia accelerated screen to the Intel accelerated screen. But

274
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,520
over the weekend, I've actually changed my setup. So I now have display ports out of

275
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,920
the back of the 1080 Ti to both monitors. So I'm not using the internal IGP at all now.

276
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:08,380
I'm driving both monitors just off the 1080 Ti. And I've actually had the happy coincidence

277
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:14,120
of a performance boost through doing that, which I can't explain. Do you think there's

278
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,000
going to be an advantage to this dedicated bastardization of an Intel processor with

279
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,840
an AMD GPU? I mean, that's sort of the big story about this NUC. Yeah, I mean, it's certainly

280
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,240
got a lot of people scratching their heads and excited in that you've got an Intel CPU

281
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:40,080
package with an AMD graphics skew on the side. A skew that it could be possible to use entirely

282
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:47,640
free graphics drivers. Yeah, absolutely. So you referred to it as Radeon graphics, but

283
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:55,080
specifically the branding here is this is RX Vega mobile graphics. And I don't know

284
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:04,200
much about how the consoles are manufactured, the PS4 and the Xbox 1S and 1X, but they obviously

285
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:11,460
have a combination of Intel CPU and Radeon graphics as well. So I wonder if this is an

286
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:17,360
evolution of that package. And maybe this is maybe the smallest games console that's

287
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,720
yet to hit the market. No kidding. Maybe future games consoles are going to be built around

288
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:27,060
similar architectures. Well, have you seen that they're pitching it, the 999 US greenback

289
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:35,560
version as a VR ready machine? Yeah, yeah, I have. Nobody cares about VR. No, of course

290
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,280
not. Yeah, there is. So the other thing about the NUC that I really, really appreciate besides

291
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:48,720
its size and its low noise profile, is that they've really built the storage ideally.

292
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,220
So the core platform is set up so that the M.2 slots, and there's two of them, I believe,

293
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,840
and the Thunderbolt controller, by the way, are hooked up directly to PCIe lanes right

294
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,440
off the PCH. So you have super high bandwidth hungry things like disk or Thunderbolt peripherals

295
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:11,400
that get dedicated PCIe lanes right to the CPU, which means your disk is sitting right

296
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,320
next to the CPU. It's got a fast track lane to the CPU. And so you combine the latest

297
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:23,960
Intel CPUs with storage that's wired directly to the CPU, and it makes for a very fast combination.

298
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,920
Yeah. And right now, in fact, on the model that I have the the M.2 SATA ports are both

299
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:38,280
MVME and they've both got their own dedicated lanes. So the disk performance is excellent.

300
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,200
What I'm really excited about in this model is I've currently got one USB Thunderbolt

301
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:55,160
port, and I have the 1080Ti connected to that. But I also have a HDMI capture card that I

302
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:00,560
can connect over Thunderbolt 3 and mimic a third screen through this capture device,

303
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,440
but I can't have both running at the same time. So I'm now kind of excited by this one

304
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,280
because I could have both of those things connected up.

305
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,240
I think this is going to be like I say...

306
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
And another one at the front.

307
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:20,000
I think this might be, you know, I find the XPS 13 extremely appealing. Maybe Dell can

308
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,200
convince me otherwise. I've invited Barton George from Dell on the show next week if

309
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,040
it works for him to talk about the new Dell hardware. But, you know, with the price of

310
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,320
Bitcoin dropping, I'm going to be more selective.

311
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
You have to watch.

312
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,960
2018 is going to be more selective. And if I can only buy one machine, I think it's this

313
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
one.

314
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:45,840
I actually had one of those new XPS 13s in my shopping basket on Sunday evening, and

315
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,840
the additional accessories I wanted. And I was sitting there hovering over the buy button,

316
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:59,800
thinking to myself, this will make my fourth XPS 13. Do I need a fourth XPS? And I eventually

317
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:04,440
decided to bail on the purchase and decided that I didn't need a fourth one of these just

318
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,320
yet. And I'm kind of glad I did because then the next day this device gets announced. And

319
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,520
I think it's going to come on the market in March, which is ahead of the projections that

320
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:21,800
I'd seen rumored of around June. So yeah, I'm going to hang on to my money and get one

321
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
of these in March.

322
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,040
I've been trying to convince Wes of this for about a year is I'm becoming a big fan of

323
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:35,600
the powerful central desktop that is permanently attached to my large NAS storage. So I can

324
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,880
run services like AmbientPlex directly on my quote unquote workstation. And then on

325
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:50,280
the edge, my edge devices can be phones, can be low end, you know, 2012 laptops that don't

326
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:55,520
need to be all that powerful because I can either remote in using X2GO to my machine

327
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:02,000
and then have my full power available. Or really what I have done is I've set up a series

328
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,880
of queue jobs where I have different folders in Dropbox. And when I drop files in there,

329
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:13,760
they sync to my powerful workstation and kick off different jobs for me. And so my theory

330
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,960
is invest in a central desktop like a NUC that could be attached to local NAS storage.

331
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,620
I mean, this thing's going to have dual gigabit networking. I could just dedicate one of those

332
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,760
to an iSCSI or NFS purpose and then the other one connected to the rest of the networking.

333
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,120
Then you could hook up external GPUs when I need to game and when I quote unquote need

334
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,200
to game. And if I don't, I could just use the baked in AMD GPU, which is going to be

335
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,040
great, which will support free sync, could have an entirely free open source driver stack.

336
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,880
And it's going to be the ideal machine to be running during the Wayland transition,

337
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
I suspect.

338
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,360
Yeah. And it's just refreshing, especially when you've run a bunch of random machines

339
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,400
with different manufacturers doing the motherboard and doing all these internals. As Wimpy said,

340
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,560
it does just feel tricked out and it feels like a proper computer that you can be proud

341
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
of.

342
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:10,220
The other thing that I am taking some comfort in, and I bet you agree, Wimpy, is this appears

343
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,360
to be a product that Intel is going to continue to invest in because the NUC now has been

344
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,200
around for ages and they've been steadily improving it. So it's something where you

345
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,540
could buy the Skull Canyon NUC last year and you essentially had full confidence that there

346
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:32,000
was going to be another NUC for you to upgrade to. And that's also kind of nice because when

347
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,880
you're buying some of these machines, sometimes the different OEMs will start up a product

348
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,600
line and they'll have it going for a year or two and then their upstream ODM changes

349
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,240
things up and they have to cancel that product line and launch an entirely new product line.

350
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,160
And there's no congruency there. There's no, you know, continuance, continuancy there.

351
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah. Now, while I appreciate that this new Hades Canyon NUC is not cheap by any means,

352
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I think the 65 watt model is going to, is rumored to be $799 and the 100 watt model

353
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,400
is rumored to be $999. But what I'm able, and that comes without disks or SSDs, it comes

354
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:20,680
without RAM and it comes without an operating system. But those three parts are interchangeable

355
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:27,680
for me. So I'm going to take the RAM and the SSDs out of my old model and plug them into

356
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,880
this one. I don't have to buy those this time around.

357
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
And your eGPU as well.

358
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,440
And I'm going to plug my eGPU in and I'm off to the races. So I actually anticipate the

359
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,020
upgrade is going to be the time it takes me to unscrew one, remove the parts, plug them

360
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,040
into the other and put the lids back on.

361
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,380
That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. And as a work station,

362
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,440
as a work station where you work and you want it to be reliable and you want to have minimal

363
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,920
fuss, that is, even if it only works for two models, even if you can only pull this off

364
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,340
from the Skull Canyon to the Hades Skull Canyon or whatever, the Hades, even if it

365
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:11,680
only happens once, that is so worth it. That kind of smooth, keep going about your day,

366
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,360
kind of, it's going to take you the time to reassemble and disassemble. That is so valuable.

367
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,520
That's what I'm talking about. The same thing here is we bought early on when the NUCs were

368
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,320
brand new and they were those cute little squares.

369
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,760
Yeah, I've had a couple of those too.

370
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Yeah, it was the same.

371
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
I have some of those.

372
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,080
Yeah, it was the same thing as we were able to move the parts between them and that brought

373
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:37,240
a certain glue and duct tapeness to them. We could just stick them wherever we needed

374
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,620
them. They weren't always even the best machine for the job, but because they were so flexible

375
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,540
and so easy to move parts in, you could just stick them wherever you needed them. It is

376
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,440
supremely useful. So yeah, this will probably be the generation I buy in. I kind of wish

377
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,640
I got this Skull Canyon. It just didn't really work out, but I think this will be the year

378
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,120
hopefully. Maybe we'll have reviews. I'm sure you'll have a review, if nothing else, on

379
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,560
the Fantastic Ubuntu podcast when it returns.

380
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,680
Well, that's still undecided.

381
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,120
Of course, of course. Yes, of course it is.

382
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,600
Christmas break. We are very much pre-curry at this point.

383
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Has curry been scheduled?

384
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,560
No, no, we haven't scheduled curry yet.

385
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Oh, okay.

386
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,800
No, we are in full Christmas New Year break, not even talking about it to one another at

387
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
the moment.

388
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Amazing. I can't even fathom.

389
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
What a world.

390
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
I can't even fathom.

391
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
What a world.

392
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,240
Yeah, it's some sort of utopia. Speaking of utopia, why not switch over to a mobile utopia?

393
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,520
Go to ting, linux.ting.com. It's a smarter way to do mobile because you only pay for

394
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,400
what you freaking use. I know. They just take your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes,

395
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,800
and they put them all together, and they're like, okay, guess what, homes? Six dollars

396
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:53,080
for the line. Then your usage. That's it. That's it.

397
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:57,760
What about like weird fees? Do I have to like sign a five-year deal to get that sweet price?

398
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,960
No contracts. In fact, you could try it for a month, and you could say, screw you, I'm

399
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,360
out of here, and there's no termination fee. In fact, if you want to turn it on and turn

400
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,240
it off, you could do that. I have two myfis from Ting, one that I leave on all the time,

401
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,320
and then one that I only leave on when I'm traveling because it's CDMA, and I'm like,

402
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,520
eh, you know, but it's great for when I'm traveling. I just go to linux.ting.com, I

403
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,760
log into my ass, I turn it on. It's so straightforward. Six dollars a month for the device means that

404
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,200
if you need a go-to line for a monitoring device, for something in your IT bag, it's

405
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,800
easy. But if you want to use it as your full service, you feel like you're hacking the

406
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,680
system, you know? You feel like you're hacking the system because you can download your audio

407
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,280
books and your podcasts, and you can pin your music on Wi-Fi, and then if you don't take

408
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:51,960
calls while you're driving, I mean, for me, when I'm commuting just between work and home,

409
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,800
I'm like some sort of new-age, non-cell using guy. You wouldn't even think I had a cellphone.

410
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,720
I don't talk to anybody on the phone when I'm driving. That's crazy. And don't even

411
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,720
text me. I'm using the, I'm using iOS 11. You know what I turned on? You know what they

412
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,720
got in that thing?

413
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,280
What do they got? What do they got?

414
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:13,800
They got this, they got this system where it automatically using the accelerometer and

415
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,660
the Wi-Fi chipset, when it notices that you're blasting past Wi-Fi access points like a maniac,

416
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:26,040
the phone goes, oh, you're driving. You're driving. Let me turn on do not disturb mode.

417
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
Wasn't that nice?

418
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,640
So people, when they text me, they get a message back going, homeboy's driving. Do you really

419
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,480
need to interrupt him? Is it that important? You what? You got nothing else to do right

420
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
now? What's your big deal?

421
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Yeah, why are you so bored?

422
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
You're so important?

423
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Get your life on.

424
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,500
So they get like this thing that comes back, tells them to shut the hell up so they don't

425
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,500
bother me.

426
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
So you're happy already right there.

427
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,960
And I don't, I don't have to deal with nothing. I just listen to my podcasts.

428
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Drive it along.

429
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,360
You're never spending a dime on cellular because you just pay for what you use. Six dollars

430
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,840
for the line, you pay for what you use. Go to linux.ting.com and I got a suggestion.

431
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,080
You need a phone? Do you need a phone?

432
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
Yeah. Oh, who doesn't?

433
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
What do you got?

434
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
Me?

435
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Do you have the Pixel?

436
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,080
I do have the Pixel.

437
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,080
But you don't really need a phone.

438
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,960
But I mean, maybe, maybe I need a phone.

439
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,600
You will. What about like a backup phone?

440
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Well, when you drop that thing.

441
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,960
Or when I, yeah, when I smashed this to tiny little bits.

442
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,440
So everybody knows that some of the best Android experiences are the Motorola devices. Check

443
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,940
this out. Motorola G5s Plus. Two hundred and fifty dollars when you go to linux.ting.com.

444
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:25,580
No contract. It's new. It's a multi-network CDMA and GSM. So you can just pick whatever

445
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,040
works best in your area. And you can even deactivate and reactivate. It's got 32 gigs

446
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,320
of storage. Goes up to 128 gigs with S, with an external SD.

447
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Oh, I love that.

448
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
MicroSD.

449
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,640
I know. More phones need to have MicroSD. Also has turbocharging so you can charge,

450
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,320
you can get six hours of battery in 15 minutes.

451
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
Nice.

452
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,240
And it has a super high resolution. It's a 5.5 inch screen. But it's a 400, 401 PPI

453
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
density.

454
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
Oh, that's good. Yeah.

455
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,360
Yeah. And it's got a fingerprint unlock. All metal design. Android 7.1 with Android 8 update

456
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,360
coming soon.

457
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,880
It sounds like flagship features without a flagship price, Chris.

458
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,060
Two hundred and fifty, two hundred and fifty four dollars. You completely own it outright.

459
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:11,160
No contract. No agreements. Nothing. Two hundred and fifty four dollars. You completely own

460
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,160
this phone. You get a great Android experience. 8.0 is coming down the pipeline. Fingerprint

461
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,720
reader. 401 PPI screen. And you pay for what you use.

462
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,120
It's obvious. Linux.ting.com. Go there. Get $25 off the device. Or if you want to bring

463
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,160
one, if you've got something that's compatible, check their BYOD page. They'll give you service

464
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:36,400
credit. Linux.ting.com. And thank you to Ting for sponsoring this here unplugged program.

465
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,680
So Cassidy James over at elementary OS wrote up a post on the medium blog that elementary,

466
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,460
I think that's how it works. I don't, I don't get medium, but my, my, my vague understanding

467
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:53,480
is, is you can have a medium blog and elementary has a medium blog. And over there, Cassidy

468
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,240
wrote about a new tool that's coming to elementary desktop users. And I thought, who better to

469
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:06,280
pick the brain of than regular friend of the show, Mr. Mr. Dan the rabbit. Yeah. So Mr.

470
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:12,840
Daniel Fore joins us and from the elementary project with I, what I perceived to be has

471
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,200
to be the only scoop on this, right? Nobody better to go to than, well, except for maybe

472
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,920
Cassidy since he wrote the post. Well, we got Dan. So Dan, what can you tell us about

473
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,840
a, what may be a renamed to something that may be named code soon?

474
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:33,400
Okay. So I guess the big, the big thing about it is it's not really necessarily a new thing.

475
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:41,880
It's a new old thing. So we've been working, um, we released our scratch text editor in

476
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,600
like 2011, right? Like when we did a Luna way back in the day and hacking on this thing

477
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:53,000
for ages kind of came to a point with it where we sat down and kind of thought about, okay,

478
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,640
what's the point of this app? Like, what is it supposed to do? Is it for notes? Is it

479
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,880
for hacking on code? Is it, you know, what, what's, what do we do with this app? And we

480
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,920
finally decided, you know, this is an app that we use every day for programming. And

481
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,280
so we're going to rebrand it. We're going to change all the defaults and we're going

482
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:16,440
to make it a great code editor and not just a generic text editor.

483
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,480
I think this is, this is great. It looks good too. Now I have so many questions that come

484
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,960
to mind when I hear this. So first of all, do you, okay, uh, boy, I don't want to forget

485
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,320
them. So I'm going to tell you what they both are. Number one, do you think people are going

486
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:38,440
to use this over say Adam or visual studio code or sublime text or insert whatever builder

487
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:46,720
or, and, and known builder? Yeah, that's that. Yeah. And, um, uh, do you foresee that a large,

488
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,600
do you, do you perceive, I guess I should say that a large portion of the elementary

489
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:56,400
os user base are developers or do you, are they more end users? This seems like, um,

490
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,920
I don't know. This is, I love it. I think it's, I think it looks great. I think it's

491
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,400
a great idea, but I also wonder if it's a little bit of, of, um, of, um, a result of,

492
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:12,480
of an echo chamber or a bubble. Um, I mean, well, to answer the first question, uh, definitely

493
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,160
at least, um, we use it all the time and we hear about people who use it cause they're,

494
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,640
they're filing issue reports and tweeting at us and stuff like that. Um, so we know

495
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,840
that there's a good amount of people that prefer having a native app to a, um, like

496
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,400
a cross platform or electronic. Yeah. Yeah. I would be one of those people. Yeah. Yeah.

497
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:37,120
Just for performance and integration features. Um, I mean, there's, there's niceties in code

498
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:43,600
that you get like, uh, so in the latest version of terminal, we have style schemes now. And

499
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,960
if you use the terminal plugin in code and you change your style scheme in the terminal

500
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,040
app, the terminal plugin and code will match the new style. Cool. There's a lot of little

501
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,640
niceties like that where it's the apps are integrated with each other and they feel

502
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,760
native. So there's, there's come some compelling reasons to use code instead of using a different

503
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,120
a text editor app like Adam. Yeah. But, uh, and your second question was, I'm sorry, what

504
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
was it?

505
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,520
I mean, do you see a large portion of your user base, um, wanting something like this?

506
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,480
Do you see a lot of developers on elementary or is it mostly just you guys that are the

507
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:24,240
developers on elementary? Well, we're definitely, um, we're working with a new, uh, large third

508
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:32,960
party ecosystem of developers. Uh, we just crossed 70 apps in an app center. So a huge

509
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,120
part of our focus on our mission lately has been making sure that we have a really great

510
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:43,400
developer story for them and including great developer tools out of the box, I think is

511
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,000
part of that story. Right. Of course you, you want to make it easier for people to make

512
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,960
applications for elementary desktop users, even if it's not a huge portion of the user

513
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,000
base people that are, there's going to be some people that are using the desktop to

514
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,640
create applications for users. That makes a lot of sense. I think it looks great. So,

515
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,560
um, all right. Can people get their hands on it right now? Or is this is like the final

516
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,160
like quote unquote code version when it's completely become code. Is that going to be

517
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:15,440
something that isn't a future release? Well, you can go pull a get master. It's open source

518
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:23,800
up at a github.com forward slash elementary forward slash code. That's super easy, right?

519
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,760
But, um, we will, we are doing the, the stable release of code will come with our Juno update,

520
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:37,240
which is the next release of elementary OS. Hmm. So Juno is going to be based on 1804.

521
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:44,000
That's correct. Oh man. You know, you know, I want to ask you like how long until after

522
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
1804, but I know you don't have an answer for me, but just to set expectations, do you

523
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,760
want to, do you want to like, like, um, set any kind of expectations, how long Juno may

524
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,320
be until we actually are downloading it and installing it on our systems? Well, I can

525
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:07,120
tell you that we're testing a 1804 daily builds right now and that we've been, um, building

526
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:13,920
all of our apps on 1710 before that in preparation. So we have a lot of major migration work and

527
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,800
regression testing already done. Um, uh, so we're really hoping to get as close as possible

528
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,680
to that 1804 release date, uh, maybe give a little padding so that we're not overlapping

529
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:32,180
with their press releases. But, um, we're, we're really going to try as hard as possible

530
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:37,520
to get it out right away. You know, it's interesting. It's awesome Daniel. Yeah. Go you. Yeah, it

531
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,800
is really good. Thanks. And I, I think, um, I've, I've been looking at elementary OS in

532
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:51,320
a different perspective as Ubuntu is getting better for some reason. Like I, I, I look

533
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:57,120
at 1804 based on gnome and I think this is going to be, this is going to be the development

534
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:02,400
workstation to compete with. 1804 is going to be canonicals second crack at shipping

535
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,880
a gnome desktop. And I'll say that 1710 is essentially the beta test for 1804. And so

536
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,040
they, they're, they're trying out a lot of stuff in 1710 and what you're going to get

537
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:20,260
with 1804 is the best of what worked on top of that. Ubuntu is enjoying, um, quite a bit

538
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:26,040
of brand recognition at the moment, quite a bit of industry support. And from all indications,

539
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,980
snaps seem to be also increasing in industry support. So these, these things are all coming

540
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,540
together I think. And plus then you combine things like the new XPS 13 and this NUC that's

541
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:40,040
coming along, it's going to just be an undoubtedly great solid Linux workstation. Uh, it, to

542
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:47,900
me it seems like 1804 is going to be uniquely competitive in its, um, draw to developers

543
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,320
and the Sputnik type users that Dell seems success with their sales. But at the same

544
00:43:53,320 --> 00:44:01,000
time elementary OS seems very poised to sort of take advantage of some of the same momentum.

545
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,820
And um, it could come down to your desktop has less rough edges than the gnome experience

546
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:13,480
and that's enough to sway a certain percentage of people. It could come down to the native

547
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,060
applications are more appealing to a certain set of users than having everything as an

548
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:25,700
electron on your Ubuntu desktop. Um, and so I, I am, I am really, I am really interested

549
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:31,400
in the Juno release because it's going to be released in such a competitive year for

550
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:35,800
Linux desktops because we're not even talking about like the work that Fedora is doing.

551
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,600
And so it's just going to be a fascinating, fascinating release to watch. And, um, I,

552
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,240
I am, I think I, at least I hope, I think you guys are going to be better positioned

553
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:50,360
the closer you are to the 1804 release, the better positions you are to be considered

554
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,840
a, you know, an alternative. Um, and uh, code and, and, and, and things like that I think

555
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,960
are a really good step in that direction. I, I'll tell you what, if you, when things

556
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,360
get closer, if you want to, if you want a very particular beta tester, let me know.

557
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,600
I'd be happy to kick the tires a bit to give you some feedback because I'm really excited

558
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,800
about the release. Definitely, definitely. And I'd love to talk to you more about it

559
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,080
on the show too, as we come up with more announcements of what we're going to be working on and we're

560
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:21,280
doing. Um, we recently kind of switched, uh, Loki over into maintenance mode and we had

561
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,000
been doing these, uh, monthly updates posts for lucky. Right. So I like that going forward,

562
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,240
um, we're going to be trying to make at least monthly posts about all the new features that

563
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,640
are coming into Juneau as they land. I, I think if you are, and not you, I mean just

564
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,480
like the proverbial, like people out there that are, that are releasing distributions,

565
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,760
if um, you didn't watch what happened with 1710 and did rocks blog posts that communicated

566
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,000
where they were going with 1710 and how, how dramatically that impacted the perception and

567
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,160
reception to Ubuntu 1710, then you're asleep at the wheel. If you are, if you are running

568
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:04,520
any distribution out there and didn't learn a lesson from how that communication made

569
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:12,500
a huge difference, then I, I, you're, you probably ought to just give up because that's,

570
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,040
I know it's difficult because it takes a ton of effort to make a great blog post like that.

571
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,240
It takes somebody who actually knows what's going on. You got to get screenshots. It is,

572
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:28,280
it is more effort than we'd like to admit it is, but the rewards are so high and um,

573
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,060
you guys are getting there with, with these, I, I've been in, I've been, I didn't expect

574
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:36,120
it throughout the Loki release. I did not, I didn't expect the updates on what's going

575
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:39,440
on and every time they've, they've landed on the blog, I've been like, that's great.

576
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,160
That gives us something to talk about. It makes the, it makes the distribution, um,

577
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,880
a relevant topic for the week. Yeah. You get an idea of what their focus is. It's like,

578
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,960
you can observe something over a longer period of time and get a better idea. Yes. Yeah.

579
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,320
So good on you. Glad to hear it. Sounds like you guys learned some of those lessons watching

580
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:02,640
the 1710 release too. And uh, boy, I just, I feel bad for the distributions that haven't

581
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,360
figured that out yet. Um, well good, Dan, keep us posted. I'm looking forward to hearing

582
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:11,120
that. Now the register has a story where they make the case that, um, it's going to be the

583
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:18,320
year of gnome and that when you add in flat pack and snaps, it could be a new revolution

584
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,980
for the Linux desktop. Um, that's right. It only took our first episode in 2018 for us

585
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:29,440
to call it as the year of the Linux desktop. Thank you, register. Um, so I guess we should

586
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,800
mention since our last episode, uh, where I was on it in, in, in 2017, there was a bug

587
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:41,800
rise. We got off the air that became public that, um, 1710 was causing some issues on

588
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:49,120
some Lenovo laptops and it was, uh, apparently it was the Intel SBI driver, which allows

589
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:55,140
for bios firmware updates, which is I guess not primetime ready. And uh, so that's still

590
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:01,320
kind of going on as, as we talk about this. So 1710 has, has been a great release except

591
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:06,640
for that whole laptop thing. Um, I haven't followed it closely. Wimpy, is there any,

592
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,940
do you have any anecdotes or any additional information or state status of where it's

593
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:16,000
at right now before I move on from it? Uh, yeah, I tell you what, I'll paste something

594
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,060
in the discourse, uh, discord just quickly. Yeah. All right. Uh, that's, that's the link

595
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:28,920
to the ISO testing for the re spin of the 1710 ISOs for Ubuntu and all the flavors.

596
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:36,420
So that testing is happening now and the release is scheduled for Thursday, the 11th of January.

597
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:44,760
And um, boy, so 1710 has been unavailable that entire time. Uh, it has for main Ubuntu.

598
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,920
Yeah. Um, so, but the, the thing is, is that everyone thinks that this is an Ubuntu problem

599
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,780
and it wasn't the case. Other distributions have had this problem. It's just at scale

600
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:01,840
more people experience it with Ubuntu. It's an Intel SBI driver issue, right? So it's,

601
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:07,160
it's really anything, anybody that turns on it. So the, the, the it's Ubuntu's fault narrative

602
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:12,080
has been well, canonical are the ones that decided to turn that feature on because it's,

603
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:17,320
it's actually turned off by default upstream.

604
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:22,320
Lots of things are turned off upstream that are turned on. Yeah. Boy, isn't that true?

605
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:29,300
Yeah. Yeah. Um, so, um, it sounds like 1710 will be again, like I said, it's in some ways

606
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:33,760
it's like you do this now to figure out what not to do for 1804, right? So it's like you

607
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,080
catch this now before it's in the LTS. Same with, um, uh, the wifi crack pass, uh, issue

608
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:47,880
and a meltdown inspector, like 1804 is going to ship with a crack patched and, uh, this

609
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:54,760
issue figured out and, um, uh, the meltdown inspector patches, right? So that's, it really,

610
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:01,240
there really is a logic to the, to the process. Um, but the register proposes that, uh, canonical

611
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:08,280
dropping unity was the biggest single story in Linux for 2017. And they think that Ubuntu

612
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,960
without unity will continue to be a big story for the foreseeable future. Um, because with

613
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,800
Ubuntu using gnome shell, remember this isn't Chris saying this, this is the register with

614
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:24,240
the Ubuntu using gnome shell, almost all the major distributions out there now ship primarily

615
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:33,680
with gnome making gnome shell, the defacto standard Linux desktop, which, um, if I, if

616
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,440
you were going to, if I were going to rewrite that, I might say making GTK more like the

617
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,520
defacto toolkit. But yeah, you're probably right. I've, I've got opinions about that

618
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:50,000
article and I'm just going to, I'm just going to start by saying these are not colored by

619
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:59,480
my involvement in the Marte project at all. This is me talking as a Linux desktop enthusiast

620
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:06,880
that has an appreciation for Linux desktops across the board. And if you look at the big

621
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:14,160
applications that people are using on the Linux desktop, Firefox and Thunderbird and

622
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:22,940
LibreOffice and Google Chrome and Skype and Slack and Spotify, just to name a few, none

623
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:31,360
of those are GTK three applications. None of those are gnome applications. So I, I don't,

624
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:39,680
I don't necessarily agree this is going to drive developers to creating gnome applications.

625
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:48,360
That's a fair point. I do think it gives the Linux desktop a more consistent target, which

626
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:55,880
is built around gnome and GTK three technologies, which lots of other desktops sit on top of.

627
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:03,160
Daniel from elementary, for example, me representing Marte here, currently budgie, but eventually

628
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:10,120
cute. Cinnamon is another one, you know, so it does give a common toolkit target, but

629
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:14,940
I really don't think that developers who want to target the Linux desktop are suddenly going

630
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:19,580
to want to learn the complexities of GTK three at all.

631
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,320
Gnome builder is not enough to make a, make that happen.

632
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:27,200
Personally, I don't think so. I think that if developers are going to come to Linux,

633
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,320
you just look at the big applications. Now you've got Adobe with brackets, you've got

634
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:39,760
Atom, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Microsoft Skype. These are all electron applications.

635
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,120
Spotify's Chromium embedded frameworks, which is a similar framework tool. I think if we're

636
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:48,840
going to see the large software vendors bring their software to Linux, it's going to be

637
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:54,580
through a more portable cross platform framework like electron, right? Yeah, these moves may

638
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:59,000
have helped several years ago, but electron is still the easiest path forward, right?

639
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,760
The most maintainable, but it does have to count for something. I mean, if you have the

640
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:10,680
ubiquity of GTK and gnome, and then you bring in flat and snap packs, it Oh, yeah, I mean,

641
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,880
the story there is there is a common target now in a way that we've never had with Linux.

642
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:21,640
Yes, definite, definitely snap and flat pack, give you a way to target the Linux desktop

643
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:28,400
in terms of easing your package and packaging and software delivery in a way that third

644
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:35,080
party developers who are not in the Linux, you know, bubble. So have had before what

645
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:41,280
about what about the horrible irony? And this is my personal opinion that our friends over

646
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:49,320
in plasma land may have better solutions. Here I am. I'm not using gnome three, because

647
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,800
I find it to be laggy and crashy, which I do not have that problem on my on my machine

648
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:59,240
at home. I'm running the plasma desktop. What about all the KDE fans out there? Because

649
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:06,000
this is this sucks. This sucks for them. If no every major does no, no, for the same

650
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,440
reason. You have the open source enthusiasts who will be developing gnome applications

651
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:20,120
or KDE applications and working on KDE or working on gnome or similar and related technologies.

652
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:24,900
And then you have projects because not even Firefox, although Firefox looks like it may

653
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,800
integrate with GTK three, it's not a GTK three application, it only takes hints from GTK

654
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,120
three, as to how to style and theme and the same is true for LibreOffice. And the same

655
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:38,720
is true for Google Chrome and Chromium. Those are probably the biggest applications people

656
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,760
are using on the desktop right now. And the same is also true for all of the electron

657
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:50,480
applications. It was only on November the 27th last year, the GTK three support landed

658
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:57,400
in electron upstream. And even today with electron, I think it's 1.8 point something

659
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:03,120
beta three, that's still linked against GTK two. So they're not releasing, you know, new

660
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,080
versions of electron that are linked and built against GTK three.

661
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:11,720
But now they have the green light, they have the go ahead to say here is the next target

662
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:15,840
for us to rebase on. Part of that is nobody wanted to pull the trigger because they didn't

663
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,600
know what to rebase on. But now if you have Fedora and SUSE and CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise

664
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:27,720
Linux and Ubuntu all shipping gnome desktop, plus then some of the most popular derivatives

665
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:36,040
Ubuntu mate, elementary OS solace, they're all using GTK desktops. The foregone conclusion

666
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:41,720
is well, that's our new target now gnome 320 or later is our new target. And I mean, give

667
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:47,280
a time I give it give it in 2019. It may be a foregone conclusion that you just target

668
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,480
gnome 320 or something.

669
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:57,200
I think elementary are the exception to the rule here in that they've actually got a growing

670
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:06,560
community of application developers targeting specifically their toolkit, their design language,

671
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:12,560
and their desktop environment. And I don't add the keyword here is growing, you know,

672
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:16,640
because it's clearly growing because every time Daniel comes on and talks about the number

673
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,840
of apps has gone up by 10. Right. And we also know that isn't an untruth because we can

674
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:28,240
see it. But I don't think that this is true for those other desktops and their application

675
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:35,280
ecosystem. But I'm not saying that the Linux desktop is in a state of decline. I think

676
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,280
it could be in a very healthy place. But I think a lot of the applications that we're

677
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:45,400
going to be using aren't going to be native to the desktop environment that we're currently

678
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,400
running.

679
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:52,200
I do agree. Yeah. And I think it's just a market reality. It's where it's the same.

680
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,420
It's not actually it's not a Linux. It's not unique to Linux. It is something that Mac

681
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:02,520
users are also going through and Windows users. Slack is a electron app on Windows is just

682
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:07,240
as much as it is on the Mac and just as much it is on a Linux desktop. It's not something

683
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,480
it's unique to us. It's a it's a bigger story. It's a bigger market dynamic that's going

684
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,580
on than Linux. And so I think I think you're just absolutely right because of those forces

685
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,580
at play.

686
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:20,280
But I'd love to hear what Daniel has to say because I know he has opinions about this

687
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:29,400
too long enough. Oh, boy, do I have opinions. Now, you know, one of the big problems I think

688
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:35,160
is actually coming from a design perspective instead of a toolkit perspective, because

689
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:42,080
even GTK apps that are built for GNOME don't necessarily work on other desktop environments.

690
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:46,680
For example, GNOME games require some system settings that are part of GNOME in order to

691
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:52,800
configure where the library gets stored. Or a GNOME builder shows two maximize icons on

692
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,800
elementary OS because it expects that in GNOME there is no maximize icon.

693
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:04,920
Yeah. Oh, that's brutal. It's so basic. It's so it's so 90s. It's so basic. It's actually

694
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,920
pathetic.

695
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,680
But I can't call this a GNOME problem because we have the same problem the other way. You

696
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,720
know, people who are writing apps for elementary OS are expecting to use our style sheet because

697
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:19,000
we have special features that they take advantage of, style classes, things like that. So when

698
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,760
you use our apps on GNOME or even on Mate, like they're really broken. And the guys in

699
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:30,280
Pop OS have been doing a lot of work in their style sheet to try to maintain compatibility

700
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,640
with apps that have been targeted and built for elementary OS.

701
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:40,760
Sure. Yeah. Now, it to me seems like this is the downside. The downside is probably

702
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:47,400
too harsh. This is the side effect. This is the action reaction when you try to create

703
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:53,360
a platform. So GNOME builder is meant for the GNOME platform, right? GNOME software

704
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:59,440
is meant for the GNOME platform, GNOME games. All of that is meant for the GNOME desktop

705
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,080
platform. And we all remember when the GNOME folks were talking about building even GNOME

706
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:09,520
OS. Remember when GNOME OS was going to be a thing? Like they're not building these things

707
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:15,720
for people running Mate or Pantheon. They're building these things for people that are

708
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:23,200
running a modern version of the GNOME platform. And if you're building a platform, just like

709
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,720
you guys are building a platform, isn't that just how it goes?

710
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:34,720
Yeah. I don't think any amount of toolkit or packaging work is ever going to solve this

711
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,440
problem. The only thing that you can do to solve it as a design and development team

712
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,080
is decide that you're going to forgo any form of desktop integration. You're going to forgo

713
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,820
rules in human interface guidelines. You're going to forgo special platform features and

714
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,820
special design features.

715
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:50,820
And then you get new Skype.

716
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:56,040
Right. You're going to build something that's either completely non-native everywhere or

717
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,280
people are going to have a bad time on different platforms.

718
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:05,960
You're completely correct. All right. Well, we got to move on, but great point. And we

719
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,080
can pick it up in the post-show if we have more, but let's talk about where you can get

in less than 55 seconds. Every single machine is SSD because they're an all-SSD cloud.

725
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:40,600
They have an intuitive API that's really easy to work with and a lot of open source codes

726
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:45,640
already built around it. But better than that, they have the interface, the dashboard for

727
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:50,640
days. DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED. I'm just going to mention this

728
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:56,040
because this is one of my personal goals for 2018. And I say I'm not a resolutions guy,

729
01:00:56,040 --> 01:01:01,080
but if there's something about just starting fresh, I'm taking advantage of monitoring

730
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:06,080
and alerting, collecting metrics, monitoring performance, and receiving alerts so I can

731
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:11,080
optimize the Jupyter broadcasting backend. And it's just built in, no additional cost.

732
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,860
DigitalOcean.com, go spin up my favorite machine. They got machines as cheap as $5 a month,

733
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:20,960
so like our $10 credit is going to get you two months for free. DOUNPLUGGED. But my favorite

734
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,200
system is $0.03 an hour. $0.03 an hour.

735
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,520
It sounds insane, right? But it's a beast.

736
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:30,160
Two gigs of RAM, two virtual CPUs, 40 gigabytes of SSD, and three terabytes of transfer.

737
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,720
You can do whatever you want on that.

738
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,720
Oh, boom.

739
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:38,320
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED. Also, quick plug for a community documentation,

740
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:45,040
how to use ProxySQL as a load balancer for MySQL on Ubuntu 16.04. And I'm going to add

741
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:50,240
an addendum. Consider also private networking, DigitalOcean's private networking feature

742
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:56,440
with ProxySQL. You're welcome. I just saved you some money. I just made things way faster.

743
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:00,440
I just made your whole thing look like a boss-level enterprise product. You're welcome.

744
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:04,080
Yeah, right. They just help you and they push you into doing the right things. You designed

745
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:05,080
it the right way. You have the right tools.

746
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:10,960
ProxySQL, with their private networking, that's like money in the bank. DigitalOcean.com,

748
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,920
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

749
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:23,120
All right. So I want to talk about, briefly, Telegram's cryptocurrency plans, mostly because

750
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,120
Wait, say that again.

751
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:25,120
Yeah.

752
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,120
What?

753
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,120
Yeah.

754
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,120
Yeah.

755
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:32,200
The Telegram Open Network. It's going to be a third-generation blockchain network. Yeah.

756
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,160
Not a first-gen, not a second-gen, Wes.

757
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,160
Third-gen.

758
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,160
Third-gen.

759
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,760
Who sets these? Who gets to decide that?

760
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,800
Everybody. Did you know that Kodak today announced that they're-

761
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,800
Yes.

762
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:42,800
Did you see that?

763
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,800
Mm-hmm.

764
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:48,760
This is getting crazy. You just put cryptocurrency or blockchain in your product name and your

765
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:54,080
stock goes up 44%. Kodak is announcing a crypto coin. So yeah, the Telegram Open Network

766
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:57,560
is coming at your face soon, Linux users. I know a bunch of you are a bunch of Telegram

767
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,200
users. It's going to be a third-generation blockchain network building on the work of

768
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:05,400
previous cryptocurrencies to provide something groundbreaking. They got a white paper, which

769
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,320
is step one when you have a cryptocurrency.

770
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,320
Oh, absolutely.

771
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:14,100
You got to have a white paper. 132-page white paper that came out on Monday. They're going

772
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:18,240
to kickstart a new cryptocurrency that will rapidly scale to meet the needs of its users.

773
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:22,520
The wallet could launch as soon as the fourth quarter of this year, with the Telegram Open

774
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:30,160
Network open to the rest of the users in 2019. It's a proof-of-stake model, which is similar

775
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:37,480
to Bitcoin's proof-of-work model. My God. I bet you will see at least another 20 of

776
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:44,680
these this year, because the technology is open source. If you've got a large user base,

777
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:49,360
if Jupiter Broadcasting had the listener base of NPR, why not launch the Jupiter coin?

778
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,360
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

779
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:55,080
You download a week's worth of episodes, and you get a coin. Then you can trade amongst

780
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,320
each other. Of course, then you have an exchange where you can convert it to other cryptocurrencies

781
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:04,680
or maybe even legal tender. There's a little bit of a skiff, a little percentage right

782
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:16,000
off the top, the Telegram takes or the JB coin takes. How long until a Linux distribution?

783
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,360
If this was, it's just like, where does it stop? Where does it end? You're going to have

784
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:28,560
distros that have cryptocurrencies. They're going to have 200 million grams in circulation.

785
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,560
Four percent will be held by the development team. Fifty-two percent will be held by Telegram

786
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:37,080
to avoid speculative trading. And the final 44 percent will be distributed in private

787
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,760
and in public in sales.

788
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,960
So will you be part of those sales, Chris? Are you going to be buying up? Are you going

789
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,960
to be investing?

790
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,200
It's the same thing. Like, if you're going to get in on a cryptocurrency, I mean, you

791
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,960
got to figure, like, this is probably going to be a semi-successful cryptocurrency. It's

792
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:57,700
probably going to be a way for bot makers to make money. It's probably going to come

793
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:02,400
up and down. You could probably speculate and day trade with it. The Telegram coin.

794
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,880
With the Telegram bot that you also wrote to buy and sell Telegram.

795
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,000
My goodness.

796
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,840
So I have a question.

797
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,840
Yeah.

798
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,960
Telegram's a Russian company, right?

799
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,560
Yeah. Well, this is how they're going to break away from the control of the Putin government.

800
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:20,520
Well, hasn't Russia, like, banned a lot of cryptocurrency stuff recently?

801
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:25,800
No, no, no. No, not quite. What they're doing is they're going to start regulating it, which

802
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,760
is really the stamp of approval for businesses to start using it.

803
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:33,080
Well, I thought they were blocking a lot of cryptocurrency exchanges, though.

804
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:38,580
That is kind of that there is a valuation period happening. But the end result. So this

805
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:42,520
has happened in other countries, too. What happens is you get a headline like Bitcoin

806
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,120
being blocked in China, Bitcoin being blocked in India, Bitcoin being blocked in Russia.

807
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:52,060
What that translates to is the government's financial components are doing a review of

808
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:56,720
how they can integrate cryptocurrencies into their fee structure. And then once they figure

809
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:01,240
out how they can regulate and tax it, they turn it back on. And now all of a sudden businesses

810
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:04,560
have been given a predictable model. They know how the government's going to react to

811
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:09,520
their cryptocurrency revenues and they they go for it. So I actually think this is a result

812
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,240
of the recent evaluation of the Russian government. This is sort of like this is the end result

813
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:15,680
of those recent headlines.

814
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,680
I see.

815
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:22,400
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. It is a crazy time we live in.

816
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,320
See, now I just now we now we need Jupiter coin. How do we let's get started on that.

817
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:34,360
I know. I know. I know. Or Ubuntu coin or Budgie coin or Solus coin. You know, ask Noah

818
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:40,680
could have the ask Noah coin. Every time you call in, you get a coin. Oh, man. Noah probably

819
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:43,720
doesn't want me to tell the story, but I'm going to tell it anyways, just just to tease

820
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,920
the Ask Noah show that's coming up next. So Noah was cleaning out the kids room, you know,

821
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:53,640
his parents every now and then just got to go into a big purge. And like two years ago

822
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:58,360
and his kids are young, especially two years ago, right? He gave his kids as like stocking

823
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:03,960
stuffers paper Bitcoins like like a not a whole Bitcoin, but like a fraction of a Bitcoin.

824
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:09,800
Yes, which were worth like twenty five dollars at the time. And so the wife and him were

825
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:12,640
looking at all the different stuff that they gone through and they found like these these

826
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,360
two or three Bitcoin paper receipts. And so Noah does a little check on him and each one's

827
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:21,320
now like worth two hundred and fifty dollars or something like that. And he's like good

828
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:24,840
work, kid. He's like, this is my life, man. I just got like Bitcoin like just hanging

829
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,900
out all over. I got loose change in Bitcoin at that bastard. But it was a pretty funny

830
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:33,880
story of, you know, you just get in on something early enough. So, you know, set some set some

831
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,240
Bitcoin aside. Or what you should do is if you've got Litecoin, set some Litecoin aside

832
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:44,360
and plan to buy Telegram coin with your Litecoin. There you go. That'll probably do it. That'll

833
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:50,960
probably do it. All right. Well, I feel like we should get into Linspire because I want

834
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,960
to finish up the Gentoo challenge and I don't want to run out of time. You guys remember

835
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:58,840
Linspire, right? Remember? Do you remember Linspire? I do. You might also you might remember

836
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:04,960
Lindos. Yep. Lindos, which was a common covered topic early on in the Linux action show was

837
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:11,140
a commercial distribution which changed hands a few times. It started out when it became

838
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:17,000
Linspire as based on Debian. And the idea was to give a familiar desktop to Windows

839
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,720
users. It was even kind of promised to make it easy to run some Windows applications.

840
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,800
Then later on in Linspire's history, it was rebased on Ubuntu and it continued to try

841
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:31,040
to be like a user friendly distribution. But eventually it was sort of a commercial failure

842
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:38,680
and it was purchased by another distribution called Xandros and then discontinued back

843
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:44,240
in 2008. So this is how far back we're going. Now I was a particularly heavy Xandros user

844
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:51,600
for a small period of time because Xandros was a Debian based distribution with out of

845
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:57,560
the box like during your setup active directory support. Oh wow. And full complete integration

846
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:03,520
with crossover office. So it associated exe's and autoruns.inf's and everything with crossover.

847
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:10,720
So you could actually take the office 2003 or whatever it was back then, the office XP

848
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:16,440
installation CD. You could put it in the CD-ROM drive of your Linux box and insert it and

849
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:21,120
the autorun installer would come up as if you would just put it in a Windows box and

850
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:26,560
walk you through the complete installation of Microsoft Office which be involved in a

851
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:32,440
shop that needed to be able to open up XLS files and use Outlook with Exchange. That

852
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:37,880
was a huge feature for me. So I was a big Xandros user. And in 2008 it was kind of a

853
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:44,920
bummer to see that Xandros decided that Linspire just needed to end. Fast forward to the end

854
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:52,880
of 2017 though and a company known as PC slash Open Systems LLC announced that they had purchased

855
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:59,140
Linspire and its community edition Freespire and would resume development of these two

856
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:09,200
Ubuntu based distributions. Now, just in the last week, Linspire 7.0 and Freespire 3.0

857
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:16,240
were released. Now, Linspire is being sold as a commercial product which PC slash Open

858
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:23,640
Systems is hoping to bundle with hardware or you can buy it. Now Freespire can be downloaded

859
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:28,920
today free of charge. Freespire is like a respin without all of the proprietary components

860
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:36,520
of Linspire. So what are those proprietary components? What do you get if you spend $7.99?

861
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:43,720
$9.99 USD? What do you get? If you spend what actually works out to be $94 when all is said

862
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:49,280
and done because they're going to ship you media and charge you for $10 or so for shipping.

863
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:56,720
So what do you get for $95 when you download Linspire? I had to know. Like this distribution

864
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,720
that's been around since the beginning of my podcast.

865
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,720
It's a burning question.

866
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,720
Like what do you get for $95 of an Ubuntu respin? So I decided to pay it so you don't

867
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:11,440
have to and I've been loading it during this show. In fact, the installation is complete.

868
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:15,360
I'm going to do a restart right now so we can kick the tires.

869
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,960
Right here live. Anything could happen.

870
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,040
I got to tell you, I played around with it for about an hour before the show too. So

871
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,100
these are early impressions, but I played around with it for an hour before the show

872
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:32,000
and I really went into it expecting it to be complete and total shit and was... Well

873
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:37,400
first of all, if I'm giving you my complete and honest impression, I thought I was using

874
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,320
the Plasma desktop at first.

875
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,320
Really?

876
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:47,720
It uses LightDM for the login manager. It's based on Ubuntu 16.04 and when it booted up,

877
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:58,320
I thought it was like a Plasma 5 desktop that's been reworked to remind you of the KDE 4 days.

878
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:04,240
But not in a bad way, but in a tasteful way. And it wasn't until I opened up the terminal

879
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:08,740
and looked at all the running processes that I realized that was the next thing I did.

880
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:13,760
That I realized I was actually on XFCE and that I was using Thunar and it wasn't the

881
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:20,040
Plasma desktop at all. So here it is right here. This is a LightDM login and I've already

882
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:25,040
set up my user account here so I'll log in. And there's, out of the box, a couple of things

883
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:31,960
that you don't get on FreeSpire. Number one is Chrome. So Chrome is the default browser

884
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,680
out of the gate. Let me clear off. So I'm running it right now under virtualization

885
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,040
because I didn't want to put it on my physical hardware. But I mean, I know it's a little

886
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:42,240
hard to see it all, but tell me if that doesn't look like a KDE Plasma desktop right there.

887
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,040
Oh yeah, I can definitely see what you're talking about.

888
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:49,840
Yeah. So it threw me for a loop just a little bit. I was surprised, but then quickly impressed.

889
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,580
It's got a nice menu launcher. It's got a couple of things pre-bundled in that I like

890
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:59,500
quite a bit. It's still shipping Pigeon. It's got VLC as the default media player. Skype

891
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,040
is pre-installed. We're going to come back to the Click and Run store here in just a

892
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:08,640
moment. There's a couple other things I was surprised by. Bleach Bit is installed by default.

893
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,640
Really?

894
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,640
That drive wiping software.

895
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,640
Yeah.

896
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:18,040
Yeah. Unet Booton is installed by default. And VirtualBox, as well as all of the LM sensor

897
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:25,480
stuff, is installed. And gdebi, my preferred package installer on Ubuntu desktops, is installed

898
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:30,640
by default. I actually think that's pretty great. Also, a very simple firewall configuration

899
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:35,880
is installed by default. I guess the best way to describe the theme is it's very Plasma,

900
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,880
don't you think?

901
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:37,880
Yeah, it is very Plasma.

902
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:42,160
It's also kind of using like the Mac OS, old Mac OS X icons.

903
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:45,600
It's not bad. I mean, I wouldn't call it beautiful, but it's not offensive.

904
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:51,920
And it's fast, right? It's very, very fast. And out of the box, Samba and NMBD resolutions

905
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:56,880
working. So let's talk about Click and Run. This is interesting. This is really interesting.

906
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:03,600
It's well, do you remember the big thing about Click and Run back in the day was it was the

907
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,080
first Linux app store.

908
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:12,060
And it was even the first Linux app store that supported payments. That was the huge

909
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:19,400
thing about Click and Run. And I was really curious to see if it had held up, if it was

910
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,800
still populated, if they had current applications.

911
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,400
Yeah, has it just wandered off into the weeds?

912
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,080
And what is Linspire without Click and Run?

913
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:31,840
Right. Yeah, that's the, that's how much of this is it Linspire in name only, or is it

914
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,840
really a continuation of this noble lineage?

915
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:40,740
Right. So I wanted to find out and that was, well,

916
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:43,600
I was surprised by what I discovered, but it actually kind of makes sense. I'll tell

917
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,000
you about it here in just a second. But first, let me mention Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com

918
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,960
slash unplugged. Go there and sign up and get a free seven day trial. It's a platform

919
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:58,680
to learn more about Linux, a full featured training library with everything you need

920
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:04,800
to know to learn, everything you need to know, everything you need to learn new skills or

921
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,300
advance your career if you're ready to kind of move forward.

922
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:15,000
I think probably my favorite feature about Linux Academy would be the learning paths

923
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:21,960
because you get content that has been specifically engineered by their instructors for specific

924
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:28,800
career tracks. And then as you go along this track, they'll spin up like virtual cloud

925
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:34,160
servers for you at SSHN and use these things really in production. They've got hands on

926
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:40,000
scenario based labs to give you experience on real servers. They have practice exams

927
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,740
and quizzes to help you prepare for certifications so that way you can really take this stuff

928
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:49,560
and apply it. And if you ever get stuck, they've got human beings that can help you, real instructors

929
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:54,760
that are standing by, full time people on Linux Academy staff to help you. That's something

930
01:15:54,760 --> 01:16:01,560
that all of these other training sites that have Linux as a feature can't match.

931
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,440
Now if you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you can sign up for a free seven day trial

932
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:12,080
so you can get a taste of what their content is, how the platform works. And the big thing

933
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:17,000
that I figured out within the first 24 hours of signing up for Linux Academy was things

934
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:21,880
that were nebulous as like, God, one day I'd like to figure out how to even try to learn

935
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:28,480
this thing. Things that were like categorized as that in my brain went to, oh, if I go to

936
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:32,880
Linux Academy and spend four hours or six hours, I can understand how this entire thing

937
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:38,680
works now. That is such a huge shift. And it's so empowering because even when you don't

938
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,840
have a specific thing you need to learn, you can go there and you can say, well, I got

939
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,840
two hours.

940
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:45,480
Right. Sometimes that's the hardest thing. You have to learn how to learn. They've done

941
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:50,020
a huge amount of that upfront work for you. You can just sit down and concentrate on actually

942
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:51,020
learning.

943
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:54,800
And then they give you a bunch of great study tools and lesson audio and personal notebooks

944
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:00,480
that you can use offline. And they have iOS and Android apps to learn on the go. It's

945
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:05,200
a great combo. Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged. Big thank you Linux Academy for

946
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:11,820
sponsoring the unplugged program. Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged. All right, Mr. West,

947
01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:17,040
before we get back to the freaking Linspire debacle that I went down, the rabbit hole

948
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:22,520
of Linspire, how is the Gen 2 challenge going over there?

949
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:23,920
It's going quite well.

950
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,520
Do you think we're getting near a graphical environment?

951
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,520
Oh, yeah.

952
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:28,520
Really?

953
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,520
Yes.

954
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,520
We've got Wayland built. We've got Sway built.

955
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,520
Yep.

956
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,840
You've got now we don't have a completely functional boot system or we do have a booting

957
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:36,840
system. I can't remember.

958
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:40,760
Yeah, it will boot. Actually, we're rebooting right now.

959
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:47,260
All right. Okay. Well, so before we get there, before we wrap up the Gen 2 challenge completely,

960
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:51,920
let me just finish off my thoughts on Linspire here. So when I launched the Click and Run

961
01:17:51,920 --> 01:18:01,360
store, I was greeted with Gnome software. The Click and Run store, yeah, the defining

962
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:10,600
feature of Linspire has been replaced with Gnome software. Now, you know, I got to say,

963
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:15,400
it kind of makes sense. It kind of does make sense. If you were going to relaunch Linspire

964
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:20,760
today, you would probably do this. And if you look at the applications that they've

965
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:29,680
featured here, hot damn, MailSpring, Hairy, Brave, Wavebox, Atom, VLC and LXD right here

966
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:33,400
on Spotify as the featured application.

967
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:38,240
Hang on a minute. Those are just the featured applications in the Ubuntu software center.

968
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,760
They haven't featured those at all.

969
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,680
No, no, no. Oh, yeah. No, and I don't mean to imply that.

970
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,480
Can I tell you who produces that list of featured applications?

971
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:49,880
But wouldn't you? I mean, I guess this is the benefit of being based on Ubuntu. But

972
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:54,480
if you're going to, this to me, this to me seems like the obvious way. If you're going

973
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:58,040
to launch Linspire today, why bother with a Click and Run store? Why wouldn't you just

974
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,040
ship this?

975
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,780
But okay, now tell us, Wimpy, who does?

976
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:03,780
Me and Popey.

977
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:07,400
Well, good job, sir.

978
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,400
Excellent work.

979
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:13,080
So how do you feel then about them sort of featuring your work? That's better than I

980
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,420
expected.

981
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:19,520
That's absolutely fine, right? They're rebasing on Ubuntu. They're taking advantage of lots

982
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:26,240
of the underlying technologies. That's absolutely fine. But if you open GNOME software on any

983
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:29,800
of the Ubuntu derivatives, that's what you see today.

984
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:34,760
I think I, you know, I was expecting, I was expecting the old Click and Run. I was expecting

985
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,720
like the purchasing infrastructure they had set up. And when I launched it, I went, oh,

986
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,720
yeah.

987
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,640
You expected it to be out of place or out of touch.

988
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,200
Well, I was disappointed. But then I was like, actually, that's exactly what they should

989
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,200
be doing.

990
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,200
Yes.

991
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:52,200
Well, good picks, by the way. Good picks, Wimpy, by the way. I think that's Open Arena

992
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:57,480
is also down here in recommended games, Frozen Bubble, Neverball, good stuff.

993
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:07,440
So it is, in a way, a shadow of its former self. It is not, I haven't got a chance to

994
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:13,120
try out the wine integration that they supposedly brought in from like their Xandros heritage,

995
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:19,200
which does sound actually kind of interesting. In a way, it is a shadow of its former self.

996
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:29,840
It is an Ubuntu respin. But then at the same time, it does offer something unique. When

997
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:37,600
I bought this for $80, $95, all said and done, I sent them an email and I said, hey, I'd

998
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:43,520
like to just have an ISO instead. Can I get an ISO today? And an actual person who speaks

999
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:50,240
English responded to me and gave me, here's a 64-bit link, here's a 32-bit link, have

1000
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,240
at it.

1001
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,240
Wow.

1002
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:56,800
So their support aspect of it is legitimate. It is something that they're actually living

1003
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:02,080
up to. There are people responding because I sent an email to the support channel. They're

1004
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:09,040
also making some interesting package choices. This is a very nice implementation of XFCE.

1005
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:14,120
I don't think it would hold up on a high DPI setup. But on a standard DPI setup, this is

1006
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:20,840
got to be one of the cleanest, simplest, most modern implementations I've ever seen of XFCE.

1007
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:27,320
It does seem like a desktop that, especially, I could just take someone who had used a computer

1008
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:31,880
before and plop them down there and they would probably get along just fine. They're doing

1009
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:36,360
a bunch of other things that I think are kind of interesting. So by default, they are turning

1010
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:41,840
on pre-linking. And they're pre-linking a bunch of libraries to try to improve performance.

1011
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:42,840
I don't know if-

1012
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:43,840
That's the default Ubuntu feature.

1013
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:49,520
Oh, OK. I was just going to say, I don't know if Ubuntu- OK. There you go. And they also

1014
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:56,480
have Samba and NNBD pre-running and setup out of the gate. They've got Clam Anovirus

1015
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,480
and Fresh Clam.

1016
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,960
Which we can't do in official Ubuntu flavors because you're not allowed to ship with any

1017
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:01,960
running services.

1018
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:06,960
Right. And they've got Clam and Fresh Clam running in the background. So you've got essentially

1019
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:12,200
out-of-the-box Anovirus. Again, Windows users seem to care about that more so than-

1020
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:16,800
It is like a tricycle for Windows users coming over to the Linux world.

1021
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:23,040
There's also a process and a user called Whoopsie. Is this- What is Whoopsie?

1022
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,040
That's WhoopsieDaisy.

1023
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,720
Is that a bug reporter?

1024
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:29,880
Yeah, it's the bug reporter for kernel traps, yeah.

1025
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:37,920
My current boss wrote WhoopsieDaisy.

1026
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:44,200
My years on Arch have colored my perception of things like this, but I understand why

1027
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:52,200
they're there. Also, there's a few other default tweaks, default applications have been changed.

1028
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:59,280
Obviously Chrome's in here. Skype's installed out of the box. Gdebi, Bleachbit. So it is

1029
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:09,600
a, in a lot of ways, it is a better out-of-the-box Windows replacement than Stock Ubuntu. If

1030
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,280
you expect your computer to work like a Windows system.

1031
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:19,640
Is it not Zubuntu with a few applications pre-installed that you can't redistribute

1032
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,640
legally?

1033
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:26,440
Yes. That is exactly 100% what it is. With Chrome, Codecs, and other things that, yeah.

1034
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:32,960
But I don't, I think it would be naive to say there isn't a market for that. That stuff,

1035
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:33,960
that stuff you're not allowed to distribute?

1036
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:38,360
I'm not suggesting there's not a market for it, no. I'm just, I'm just saying you could

1037
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:42,560
do the same thing with Zubuntu because you could install Zubuntu, open the software center

1038
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,880
and install all of those applications that are-

1039
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:47,880
Right, yeah. Right, but there's something about it being, I think there's something

1040
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:51,040
about the idea of it being a pre-packaged solution. So when you think about the way

1041
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:57,680
you get Linspire, you don't even get an ISO. You go spend $95 and what you get is a thank

1042
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:00,280
you email saying that your package is on its way.

1043
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:04,400
It's really a story about like trying to understand the perspectives and goals of the people who

1044
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,560
are behind it.

1045
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:10,440
Yeah, and it's not, it's not my goal. That's not my perspective. But yeah, what you're

1046
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:16,920
basically getting is you're getting Chrome, you're getting Thunderbird with Exchange and

1047
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:23,640
Google Sync plug-ins installed. You're getting VLC, Clam AV, you're getting.NET Core support,

1048
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:29,040
XFS, I don't realize, I don't know why they outlined that. Intrusion detection, Bleach

1049
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:34,000
Bit, these are the other things, and ICE SSB are the main things that they say are included

1050
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:40,360
with Linspire over traditional Linux, aka Ubuntu. And you also get 12 months of email

1051
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:44,420
and phone support with that.

1052
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:48,080
And that's what your money is really buying, right? It's that support.

1053
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,840
I suppose, or maybe the ability to distribute some of that software. And then it's based

1054
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,720
on LTS, so it's supported until 2025.

1055
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:55,720
Is it?

1056
01:24:55,720 --> 01:25:00,520
That's what they say, you know, yeah.

1057
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,560
How are they doing that?

1058
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:08,840
Also, apparently, if you're a business, they'll spin you custom ISOs and do non-site setup.

1059
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:13,040
Yep, yep. And they have a cloud version as well that you can buy, which is actually cheaper

1060
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,040
than the desktop version.

1061
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,040
The cloud version?

1062
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,040
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1063
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:19,040
This is based on 16.04?

1064
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:21,520
Yes, sir, yeah.

1065
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,160
So how are they doing support until 2025?

1066
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:29,640
Well, how long is 16.04 supported?

1067
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,640
Five years.

1068
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:31,640
Hmm.

1069
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:32,640
Hmm, indeed.

1070
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:42,560
I mean, it does say until 2025. It says Freespire is supported until 2021, and Linspire is supported

1071
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:44,360
until 2025.

1072
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:48,000
Okay. Good luck with that then.

1073
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Yeah.

1074
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,400
2022 is going to be real tough.

1075
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:56,360
It's an interesting, it's obvious play towards a completely different market than anybody

1076
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:01,640
that would be listening to this show or me. And that's kind of why I wanted to try it,

1077
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:05,320
is when something like this comes along, when Linspire comes along again, and it's like,

1078
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:08,480
what makes it worth $95?

1079
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:12,440
I'd also be interested to meet someone who had found, you know, like, oh, I'd heard my

1080
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:16,400
grandson had told me I really needed to get that Linux, and they ended up finding this.

1081
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:22,100
I wonder if it's not more about the story that you're able to tell a potential OEM partner.

1082
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:25,760
This is Linspire. It has a, you know, you go into the heritage, you go into the fact

1083
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:29,780
that it's got wine sort of baked in, which is an aspect I admittedly did not get into

1084
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:34,960
in this review, which is just barely a review. It's more of like a first look. And, you know,

1085
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:40,440
you see you have the story of a Linspire heritage, Windows support. We ship it with Chrome. We

1086
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:46,000
ship it with the Nvidia binaries. We ship it with Thunderbird that has exchange support.

1087
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:51,980
It's a story that you could tell an OEM that maybe is more appealing than a free-loving

1088
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:56,280
all GPL software distro. I don't know.

1089
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,560
Or at least something they can understand a little bit more, right?

1090
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,720
But we'll see where it goes. So we're checking in at the beginning of 2018. They just had

1091
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:06,600
their new version 7.0 Linspire release. We'll see where it goes for the rest of 2018, I

1092
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:07,600
suppose.

1093
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:13,160
And remember, one of the only benefits when it comes to having a non-free software included

1094
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:17,080
is they can actually bundle it in a box in a store and sell it.

1095
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:21,120
Yeah, or on a machine, which I think is what they plan to do.

1096
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:24,240
So what do you think? Replacing the studio machines? We're going all Linspire?

1097
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:25,240
Yeah, 100%.

1098
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:26,240
Yeah.

1099
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:27,240
You've been talking it up all day.

1100
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:29,200
It's supported until 2025, so it's obvious.

1101
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:33,600
Yeah, install once and then, I mean, will there even be JB by then? Who knows?

1102
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,080
Finally. Finally.

1103
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:39,000
Actually laughing out loud.

1104
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:45,760
I give them credit for responding to my support email requests and actually giving some thought

1105
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:50,080
to some applications to bundle with it. We'll see where they go. I'd be curious.

1106
01:27:50,080 --> 01:28:01,680
All right, Mr. West. Are you ready, sir? Are you ready, Mr. West?

1107
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:06,200
Perhaps the worst idea happened when I went to New York. I noticed you guys didn't do

1108
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:10,760
a Gen 2 Challenge check-in last week. I see how that is. I see you save it for me when

1109
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:13,160
I'm around, because we could have wrapped this up last week.

1110
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:17,760
You've been so fascinated by the whole affair. I didn't want to deprive you.

1111
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:18,760
So how's it going?

1112
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:19,760
Sort of like a homecoming.

1113
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,840
So you checked in last, during the show, you were rebooting.

1114
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:26,560
We are live in Sway on Wayland.

1115
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,600
You've gotten to graphical mode.

1116
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:32,520
Do we have a sky cam? Let's see here. We do have a sky cam. We only see this. Holy crap!

1117
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:36,280
It doesn't look like much. It hasn't been super configured yet, but look at there it

1118
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:41,040
is. There we can almost see it. There it is. That is totally boring and a total-

1119
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,920
It may be the most boring thing I've ever seen.

1120
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:45,000
That is really boring, but so this is Sway.

1121
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,480
Yeah, on Wayland.

1122
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,520
Not bad.

1123
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,800
No X anywhere.

1124
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,360
Not bad. No anti-aliasing either.

1125
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,440
No, no anti-aliasing. Why would you want that?

1126
01:28:53,440 --> 01:29:02,440
That is a full Gen 2 system boot up right there with Sway. You did it. You did it. Wow!

1127
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:05,440
Up your shaft.

1128
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:10,280
Good job, Wes. I don't know if it was worth it. So what was that? Five episodes? It took

1129
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,040
five weeks of building software?

1130
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:13,040
On and off anyway.

1131
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,040
That's not bad really.

1132
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:15,040
In a virtual machine.

1133
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:18,240
So you probably, if you would have given it a good solid three and a half hours, you could

1134
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:22,320
have gotten- Oh yeah, definitely. Plus a lot of that was trying to do the show and read

1135
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:25,520
through the handbook, which had been years since I'd read through. So there was some

1136
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,760
of that. Now I think, yeah, give me an hour and a half and a fast machine and we'll be

1137
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:30,760
done.

1138
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:37,280
We've had a lot of fun with Gen 2 over the Gen 2 challenge, but Wes and I were discussing

1139
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:42,080
this, and we realized we actually did walk away with a bit of a lesson from this whole

1140
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:46,920
thing. Because sort of the ongoing joke was, what good is Gen 2 for? What's the point of

1141
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:51,920
Gen 2? Even now in 2018, do you really need these optimizations that you might be able

1142
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:58,160
to get when you build your own software? What's the damn point of Gen 2? And sort of perfectly,

1143
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:06,320
on January 6, a great post, a science project really, make the 486 great again. Running

1144
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:14,120
modern Linux on an ancient 486 PC. This PC, which was released in 1989, which, fun fact,

1145
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,120
before the Meltdown problem.

1146
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,120
Right.

1147
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:21,920
It was a specular of execution. And this is about as far back as you can go and still

1148
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:29,800
have actual genuine kernel support. But just because the Linux kernel supports the 486

1149
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:35,640
processor doesn't mean that any distribution out there and its packages do. And there was

1150
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:39,720
only one system that supported it.

1151
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,920
When you're in a situation like this, where do you turn, right?

1152
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:42,920
It's only one.

1153
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:43,920
There's only one.

1154
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:49,120
Yeah. And Gen 2 was perfect because the issue with modern Linux distributions like Debian

1155
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:54,800
or Ubuntu or Arch is that they distribute binary packages, which we all think is great.

1156
01:30:54,800 --> 01:31:00,440
But when you need something like a 486, while it's theoretically supported by the modern

1157
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:05,160
Linux kernel, the distribution packages do not support it. Debian dropped support for

1158
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:15,520
586 32-bit CPUs in 2016. The oldest supported x86 CPU by Debian is the 686, which was released

1159
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,520
in 95, which is when speculative execution started coming along.

1160
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,080
So you don't want that.

1161
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:26,480
No. But the thing about Gen 2 is you can freaking build the packages yourself. And you can install

1162
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:34,920
Linux on this crazy, esoteric edge case that most people would never even think of. And

1163
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:40,640
if you think about it, that's the beautiful thing about Linux itself. It's this general

1164
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:45,200
purpose technology platform that brings life to devices and enables technology in ways

1165
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,640
we never even considered before.

1166
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:53,280
Right. I'm sure a lot of people are asking, why? Why would you do this? But that's irrelevant

1167
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:57,480
because, like you say, it is this general purpose. And a lot of interesting things happen

1168
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:01,500
when you don't really ask why and you just are open to exploration.

1169
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:03,680
Nothing else could do this.

1170
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:08,080
I mean, some BSDs, but in the Linux landscape.

1171
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:12,520
Nothing useful could do this. Nothing that you would want to actually use and could connect

1172
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:19,000
out to the internet and clone a Git repo and install Python 3.63 could do this. It has

1173
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,240
to be Linux. And Gen 2 is one of the few Linuxes that actually could make it possible.

1174
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:28,200
Right. You don't have to be a giant corporation who has manpower to build your own distribution

1175
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:32,640
or custom compile everything. You have a framework that's been developed over years to make it

1176
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,080
easy for you to do it.

1177
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:39,160
What's great is it takes about 11 minutes for boot up.

1178
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:42,060
And then just have a cup of tea. You'll come back. It'll be up.

1179
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:46,700
They hooked up a Sound Blaster 16 and took a couple of minutes for the music playback

1180
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:54,240
to start working. It also took a couple of minutes for SSH to connect in and took about

1181
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:59,720
only three minutes to clone a Git repo. And shutdown took about five and a half minutes

1182
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:02,320
to shut down.

1183
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:04,240
That's incredible.

1184
01:33:04,240 --> 01:33:10,120
The whole post goes through how they got Linux 4.14.8 running on this.

1185
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:12,400
Like a brand's making new kernel too.

1186
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,400
Yeah.

1187
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,400
Like that, right?

1188
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,760
Yeah. It's just really remarkable. It really is so cool. They used an old version of damn

1189
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:23,000
small Linux as well to try to mess around. And this, you know, it's sort of the perfect

1190
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:30,200
conclusion to the Gen 2 challenge because it does show you what is Gen 2 good for. And

1191
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:33,520
it's good for people that are doing things you've never even thought of.

1192
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:38,040
Yeah, absolutely. I still think it's a fun playground. I'm going to leave this here for

1193
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:41,960
a while, at least just to play with Sway and maybe some other things. Also just Emerge

1194
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:46,720
is great. It's really fun to get to spend a little time, especially, you know, like

1195
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:50,900
I love Linux. I play with Linux, but I also get all of my work done on Linux. And so this

1196
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:55,600
was a nice reminder that like the internals are fun. Configuring a kernel is fun. Really

1197
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,600
getting to know your system.

1198
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:57,600
Yes.

1199
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:02,200
And I think if I was doing a bunch of Linux development, it might be a system that I would

1200
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:06,400
really like to be able to just customize play and have access to all these tweakable sources

1201
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,400
right there.

1202
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:12,640
Beard chimes in with the fact that Slackware can still do high 586. Damn it Beard. Go check

1203
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:17,320
out Beard at rec.net. I hear that son of a bitch is streaming more than ever. Mr. AtWestPain

1204
01:34:17,320 --> 01:34:21,960
right there on the Twitter and check him out on the new rebooted TechSnap as well as me.

1205
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:30,120
I'm at Chris LAS. Get more wimpy at the Ubuntu podcast and join our subreddit at linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

1206
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:35,640
This year's show is live on Tuesdays over jblive.tv followed now by the Ask Noah program.

1207
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:41,300
So it's a whole afternoon slash evening slash insert local time of Linux. If you join our

1208
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:46,160
virtual lug, you can also take advantage of that in the Ask Noah program. So geez, it's

1209
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:50,240
never been better to join us over jblive.tv for quite the live experience. Thanks for

1210
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,240
being here. We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1211
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:34,000
Oh, thank you, virtual lug. You guys are great. Now we just got to pick a title. And

1212
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I think we're done. I think we're done. It was a fun show. It was a fun show. I enjoyed

1213
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:46,280
the hell out of that. Yeah. I enjoyed the hell out of it. So are you still going to

1214
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:51,080
get the install media for linspire in the mail? Okay, good. That's almost a trophy.

1215
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:55,920
I'm gonna follow up when it comes in. Most expensive USB stick ever. It's probably the

1216
01:35:55,920 --> 01:36:00,360
bare minimum. It's like just four gigs. That could be a title. Most expensive USB stick

1217
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:04,560
ever. Most expensive Linux distro ever. Yes, that's someone that's there. There is the

1218
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:09,200
show title right there. What about most expensive Linux distro ever? Because it really is I

1219
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:15,280
don't know of a more expensive you can't where else can you spend $95 a distro? What's Oracle

1220
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:20,980
charging these days? $5 more and you can get Windows 10. Wow. You know, but most expensive

1221
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:29,160
Linux distro ever is very long. Is there a tighter way to say that? That'll do. That'll

1222
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:34,300
do. Yeah, most expensive Linux. I almost feel like it's got to be long. I don't know. Long

1223
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:40,160
and complicated. Break in the bank. Yeah, green light for Linux. Yeah, just do Linux

1224
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:43,820
and a bunch of dollar signs. So hey, beer, what do I do? Do I do? Is there a scene for

1225
01:36:43,820 --> 01:36:48,240
ask Noah? Like, what do I do when it's asked Noah time? You turn off the stream and Noah

1226
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:54,240
picks it up. Oh, that's right. What? Oh, hey, buddy. Bang suggest working discord. Oh, there

1227
01:36:54,240 --> 01:37:01,140
we go. So hold on. You telling me between between West Noah and beard. You I guess last

1228
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:04,360
week was kind of crazy. There we go. Martin. That's true. I forgot about that. That was

1229
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:08,380
crazy. All right. I understand. I thought we would have had this shit fixed by now.

1230
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:12,640
It's cool. Well, you were gone. So we didn't have only there was some sort of like remote

1231
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:19,040
login system on the OBS system that Noah was integrated with where he could just connect

1232
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:26,620
in both you goofballs multiple times. Just give me permission. Just give me permission

1233
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:29,680
and I'll make it happen. I'm a goof. What do you mean? How do you not have permission?

1234
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:34,640
I installed your remote like verbal permission like screw with your broadcasting machine.

1235
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:38,080
Good to be good. Actually. I mean, could you just solve problems gonna happen? And he's

1236
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:41,520
gonna blame you anyway. So that's all right. So we so we do have to so I should probably

1237
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,120
like we should probably interrupt the stream soon. So that way there's time for YouTube

1238
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:50,080
to reset. Hey, so if people want to hang out in mumble for ask Noah, where should they

1239
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,080
go?

1240
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:57,720
Like not the best week of that because I have a guest. But oh, right, right. If you guys

1241
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:01,160
if you guys hang out in there and and either he's he comes in late because I know he's

1242
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:05,600
on a call with a customer right now if he comes in late or if we wrap up I'll jump back

1243
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:10,320
in mumble. So what is that? Does that mean stay here or does that mean you're gonna be

1244
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:13,560
are you gonna be sending a feed into the mumble room? Can they hear the show or do they got

1245
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:20,320
to still go? God damn it, Noah. Yes. Hey, listen, we send a feed to tune in. We send

1246
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:25,080
a no show. I know we said I know live.tv. We can't keep your radio.com. There's like

1247
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:46,280
a billion ways. I know escape the show. Yeah. All right. All right. Good enough, Noah.
