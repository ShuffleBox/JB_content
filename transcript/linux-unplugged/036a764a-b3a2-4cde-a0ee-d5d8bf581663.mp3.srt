00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 81 for February 24th, 2015.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,720
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's in it's time machine and

3
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,560
ready to go in the way back machine to look at some of your favorite topics.

4
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,440
My name is Chris, I'm flying solo this week because it's a disaster here at the Jupiter

5
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
Broadcasting.

6
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,680
I'm actually in the bunker right now, you didn't know this, but we have a bunker underneath

7
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,240
the Jupiter Broadcasting Studios.

8
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,200
A hatch opens up here in the studio right about where I'm sitting and I just kind of

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,160
fall down into it, it closes and then that's the bunker.

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,120
And down here we can only do limited things.

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,880
Unfortunately the bunker was installed a while ago and we just have a Tetris arcade machine

12
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,160
in there.

13
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,200
So I can't do a podcast, no actually what it is is that we're just on reduced staff

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
this week.

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,600
So we're going to do a look back because we've been collecting these clips.

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,800
Back when we set off to do a best of, we got a whole bunch of your submissions for what

17
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,640
could be a best of Linux Unplugged episode and we only got to use like a super small

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,500
handful of them.

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,200
And so we've been kicking around ideas of topics we wanted to revisit and look back

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
at.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,960
So this week I'm going to join you on a journey into the way back machine, we'll look at some

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,880
of those topics and revisit some of the classics that you submitted from the audience and we'll

23
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,860
share a few anecdotes together, unbutton our pants towards the end of the show like we

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,960
normally do and have a Diet Coke.

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,960
Right?

26
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
Isn't that what you're doing?

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
That's what I'm doing.

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,160
By a totally impromptu live stream who doesn't even, I don't even tell anybody we're doing

29
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
a show right now.

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
So thank you guys for being here.

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,720
I mean, I don't know what the hell you're doing here.

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,200
Shouldn't you be at work or something?

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
What?

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Bunch of slackers?

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,480
Anyways, we should get on with the show.

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,520
So we're going to take a retro look back and I'll join you from time to time to talk about

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
things.

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,160
And we start of course with a classic.

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,120
Okay, but this one comes in from Bob.

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
It's safe territory.

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
We're not going to get anybody too upset.

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,680
He says, hi guys.

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,240
Just a quick note, Chris mused that maybe the day is near that you could run with a

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,760
machine without a swap partition.

45
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,600
Well this intrigued me and for the last year I've been running my eight gigabyte laptop

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,040
with no swap partition and have not noticed any issues even when giving it a pretty thorough

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,040
workout.

48
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,040
In fact, it worked so well that I honestly forgot about it.

49
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,680
One thing that had bugged me though was that the Hibernate hasn't been an option on Ubuntu

50
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
for me.

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,240
I just assumed that it was a config issue or the hardware not being supported.

52
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,160
I found out I could run pm-hibernate command but it would just simply not Hibernate.

53
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,120
My frustration boiled over today and I went digging for clues.

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,880
It looks like it may just simply be a case that a swap partition is required for Hibernate

55
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,720
to work as where the memory image is written out before the machine shuts down.

56
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,800
I goled, that's groaned out loud, when I found this out.

57
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,720
I'm not yet, I cannot yet confirm this issue but I thought I'd share experiences for the

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
benefit of all.

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Bab.

60
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah, that is true.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That is true.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,840
That is the downside to running without swap.

63
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,920
And you know, I have a swap.

64
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,960
All my machines have swap right now.

65
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,280
Do you do swap partitions still?

66
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
I do.

67
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,880
I mean, and honestly, it's just a legacy habit.

68
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,320
I mean, it's like, it's almost like building machines and putting a floppy to drive in

69
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
it.

70
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
You do something like out of habit.

71
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,480
It's like, why the hell am I putting this thing in here?

72
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,640
Or actually, Matt, I don't mean to age you but it's now CD-ROMs, Matt.

73
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
It's not floppy drives anymore.

74
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
What?

75
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
It's CD-ROMs now, yeah.

76
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,440
Well, I've got my cassette tape drive sitting right here.

77
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,440
That works.

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,920
Magnetic media is the future.

79
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,320
Why hibernate when you can just either suspend or boot?

80
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,040
I mean, what kind of system takes that long to boot anymore?

81
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,040
I don't know.

82
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,560
I'd put it out to the mumble room if anybody in here has a strong feeling on swap partitions.

83
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,960
Anybody in the mumble room running swap free these days?

84
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,120
Yes, kind of.

85
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,120
I use swap files instead.

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
Yeah, okay.

87
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,680
Can I jump in quickly?

88
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Okay.

89
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,140
You only need swap if you're using a laptop and you want to put it into hibernate.

90
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,360
If you've got more than two gigs of RAM, you do not need swap.

91
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,720
Swap is only used for hibernation.

92
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,880
Well what about crashing?

93
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
That's not true.

94
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
Yeah.

95
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
That's completely incorrect.

96
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Here we go.

97
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
And it's on.

98
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
Basically-

99
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Yeah, okay.

100
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,200
So let's say you've got three gigs of RAM, what is swap used for?

101
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,040
I use a swap partition in order to compile my kernel.

102
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,320
Usually I don't have like five or six gigs partitioned or put on my rig so I use a-

103
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,400
I knew this would be a hot topic.

104
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,200
But I have 12 gigs of swap.

105
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,720
Even on machines I have 144 gigs of RAM.

106
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Yeah, I do too.

107
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,920
If you have no swap at all, the only negative thing I add is you can't hibernate.

108
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
That's it.

109
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,740
No, there's no negative things.

110
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,560
First of all, if you don't have any swap space, as soon as you're out of memory, the kernel

111
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,900
either has to start killing random processes or panic.

112
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
There's no other option.

113
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,440
Okay, but you've got four gigs of RAM.

114
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
It's not an issue anymore.

115
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Yes, it is.

116
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,560
If I want to gig the swap, I think should be enough.

117
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,360
Just as a safety, I mean if I want to gig, you only have a boot partition or a swap file.

118
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
Yeah, exactly.

119
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,520
Oftentimes you'll make the swap only 512 megabytes or something, which is just enough so that

120
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:35,000
really inactive stuff can get out of your way because any free RAM is wasted RAM.

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,440
So you use as much of your RAM as you can for your file system cache and things like

122
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
that.

123
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,800
But if the program is completely idle, why have it wasting memory that could be being

124
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,200
used for cache if you could swap it out?

125
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
This is my philosophy too.

126
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,800
Yeah, just to be safe.

127
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,280
Having even just that little bit means that a program can be swapped out.

128
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Yeah, but hard drives are a lot slower than RAM, so you want it all in RAM.

129
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,160
Right, but if the program is always idle and its memory is not in use, then it's even worse

130
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
than just wasting it.

131
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,720
So you may as well just write it to the disk even if it's slow.

132
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
It's not being used.

133
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Who cares if it's slow?

134
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,280
But the important thing is that a lot of applications will adjust their behavior based on memory

135
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
pressure.

136
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,720
For example, the XenFS file system will free up some RAM when there's memory pressure.

137
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,760
But for those couple of seconds, while that's happening, there's nowhere for the program

138
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
to go.

139
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:42,960
Whereas if you have even just a little bit of swap, most of the time if you need a swap,

140
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,960
you'll know that you'll need a swap partition.

141
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Otherwise, you can never...

142
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Right, but your Firefox profile is being used, so it's good that you're storing it in RAM,

143
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
right?

144
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
Yeah, but I stored it in RAM.

145
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
I actually stored my Firefox profile in RAM.

146
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
Right, but that's good because it's actually fast then.

147
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
But that doesn't change the argument about using swap.

148
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
It's not an answer.

149
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
It works for you.

150
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,880
You may not use more than four gigs of RAM, but there do exist people who use more than

151
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
four gigs of RAM.

152
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
Yeah.

153
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
All right, there you go.

154
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,960
So you can see, I did that as a pure demonstration that this is not a cut and dry topic, right?

155
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,480
That was Chris making a point right there.

156
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,200
I think there's no total right answer other than you should use some swap unless you're

157
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,520
somebody who thinks you shouldn't, and that's really the way to leave it.

158
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,640
Excuse me, and allow me to interrupt here.

159
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,600
I'm coming in from the bunker again with a quick message from some dear friends of the

160
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
show.

161
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,320
That's right, our good friends over at Linux Academy.

162
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,800
In fact, go to linuxacademy.com.plug.

163
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,560
That's where they've made a little spot for you, a little home for the Linux Unplugged

164
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,360
audience because you're going to get the special 33% discount on the Linux Academy subscription.

165
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,080
And Linux Academy is a great resource to further your education, but also to challenge yourself

166
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,420
a little bit, just to kind of see what's new because Linux Academy does such a good job

167
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,760
of staying on top of the latest technology developments.

168
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,080
Things that come along that are honestly something that usually takes most shops a while to kind

169
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,440
of get their head around, Docker, all the changes to the virtualization landscape.

170
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,220
And as OpenStack continues to evolve, and as DevOps becomes more of a defined thing,

171
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,000
they're constantly tweaking and adjusting, responding to that.

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,120
And they have live stream courses where you can always ask the instructors questions,

173
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,320
and you'll notice immediately during these courses that these are people that truly care

174
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,560
about the subject matter.

175
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,660
And then that's where you start to get the difference, right?

176
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,960
You start to understand that Linux Academy cares a little bit more than everybody else

177
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,860
about the subject matter, and that closes that 10%.

178
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,360
And you really begin to see the value of the Linux Academy system when you get to take

179
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,840
advantage of things like their step-by-step video courses and downloading that content

180
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,060
that you can take offline and read on your own.

181
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,840
That's material that you can refer back to forever.

182
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,000
That's insanely valuable.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,680
And they spin up your own servers as you're going.

184
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,440
Your subscription includes labs, even on AWS if that's what your course is required.

185
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,400
There's seven plus Linux distributions that you can choose from, and I would recommend

186
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,840
one that I haven't suggested for a little while, but you hear it all the time, OpenStack.

187
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,680
Well, what the hell is OpenStack?

188
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,640
Do you know?

189
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,040
They have an OpenStack Essentials course.

190
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,280
Go over to linuxacademy.com and go figure it out, right?

191
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Have you played with Docker?

192
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,200
I mean, you've heard us talk about Docker, but are you familiar with it?

193
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
What about Python?

194
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,920
What about backing up your Linux system?

195
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,560
What about deploying NGINX?

196
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,280
Are you familiar with all of these topics, or could you use a refresher?

197
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,560
Have you done it once under a CentOS box, but never done it under an Ubuntu rig?

198
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,400
Because you get to choose from your distribution.

199
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,000
Not only do the virtual machines change, but all of the courseware also automatically adjust

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,320
to the seven plus distributions you can choose from.

201
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,520
So you could experience something on one platform, move over to the other distribution, try it

202
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
over there.

203
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,760
And the other thing they do that's really cool is they have scenario-based training.

204
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
So you get to actually implement these things in a production environment, actually bang

205
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,120
on them from a public address, and really get a feel for the technology ever before

206
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,760
you've gone out and done something where, you know, your job's on the line, or the contract's

207
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,640
on the line, or anything like that.

208
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,440
The scenario-based training is one of the best ways to get hands-on, real-world experience

209
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,960
under the guidance of an instructor.

210
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,840
And it's, once again, a differentiator that they have because they've built this entire

211
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,860
Linux Academy platform from the ground up to match exactly what their vision was.

212
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,860
It's pretty cool.

213
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,060
Go check out their courses on AWS, PHP, OpenStack, Android, Ruby, Python.

214
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,480
It's all really good stuff.

215
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,400
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

216
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,640
Get our special 33% discount.

217
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,440
Go see what I've been talking about.

218
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,840
And go enjoy the community, too.

219
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,800
If you ever kind of bottom out a little bit and you're losing motivation, they have a

220
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,240
really good community that'll help pick you back up.

221
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,760
And a lot of them are filled with Jupiter Broadcasting members, too, so that's really

222
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
cool.

223
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,900
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

224
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,920
And a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

225
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,000
Big thanks to all of you guys who also visit our sponsors.

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,600
Now we'll be down here in the bunker for a little bit longer.

227
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,200
I think I have a can of olives over there and some really old whiskey.

228
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
So I should be set.

229
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,320
I'll kick back and we'll watch a little more of this retro spectacular with you.

230
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
All right.

231
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,560
Well, let me bring Michael Hall into our restricted casting room here.

232
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,600
And Michael, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

233
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,640
Thank you, guys.

234
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,720
So you had a really great post this morning on your blog, emhall119.com, and you said

235
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,000
it's a new 80-20 rule for open source.

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,320
So before we get into that, I noticed, are you trying to do like a blog a day kind of

237
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
a thing right now?

238
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Yeah.

239
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,240
There was some conversation at the end of January about the content going on Ubuntu

240
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,240
Planet.

241
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,600
And I didn't come up with it.

242
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,000
I stole this idea of doing a blog a day for a month.

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,400
So you're hoping to sort of populate the Ubuntu Planet with some reoccurring content every

244
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
day kind of a thing?

245
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Yeah.

246
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,800
I was just trying to get people to kind of blog more actively on it.

247
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,160
So what do you do at Canonical?

248
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,120
Well, as you mentioned earlier, my official title is Upstream Liaison, but I really haven't

249
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,800
been doing a lot of upstream liaising lately.

250
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,880
I've been doing a lot of app developer focus.

251
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,080
Yeah, I bet.

252
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,640
As you guys are ramping up the Ubuntu Touch effort, right?

253
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Yeah.

254
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
And the Ubuntu SDK.

255
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,120
It's really a lot of exciting stuff going on.

256
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,920
What has got you most excited right now?

257
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,080
Everything around the app development and the phone.

258
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,900
I mean, I've got a Nexus 4 that's running Ubuntu, and it's been my primary phone since

259
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,840
August of last year.

260
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:11,160
And just the workflow using the phone is so much better for me than what Android was.

261
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
So is that really...

262
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,360
I mean, the essence of that is, you know, because so many people when we talk about

263
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,100
the mobile market, so many people talk about, oh, you know, Android's there, they're the

264
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,360
new Windows, they're dominant, the market's all locked down.

265
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,840
But you're telling me that you sit there, you're using this thing, you're like, you

266
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,400
know what, this works for me.

267
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
And that's what's got you excited.

268
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,840
It's like, I see this fitting into my workflow.

269
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,680
And do you think this is like a whole new generation of opportunity for Ubuntu?

270
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
I think it is.

271
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,360
And the thing we have over everybody else in the market right now is that we're running

272
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,640
the same software on the phone as we are on the desktop.

273
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,200
So it's not like, you know, you've got completely different platforms like you do with the iOS

274
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,120
and OSX, or even Windows and Windows Phone.

275
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,840
And of course, you know, Android, there's not even anything on a desktop space with

276
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
Android.

277
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
There's Chrome OS.

278
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,240
So being able to have just the one platform on all the devices, being able to have the

279
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,400
same apps on all your devices, it really changes the experience of it.

280
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,840
So changing gears to your blog post here, I know you've been active at Canonical for

281
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
a long time.

282
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,000
You've been in the open source community for, do you have a rough estimation of like how

283
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,520
long you've been in?

284
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,200
I've been involved with the Ubuntu community for probably six, seven years now.

285
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,120
And so you've had time from that perspective to sort of notice trends as they come and

286
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,300
go, you know, the big hoopla's of the week that sometimes last multiple weeks, sometimes

287
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,280
fizzle out fairly quick.

288
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,680
And I thought, you know, you had a really poignant piece when you wrote here on your

289
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,880
blog, people tend to appreciate it more when you only give them 20% of something.

290
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,720
And then they resent you if you give them 80%.

291
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,280
Let's unpack that a little bit.

292
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,000
When you say people resent you, people appreciate it more when you give them 20%, that sounds

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,200
crazy to me.

294
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,880
That sounds like that sounds ludicrous.

295
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
What do you mean by that?

296
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,560
Well, it does sound ludicrous.

297
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,760
But what I realized is that at some point past the 50% mark, I just chose 80-20 because

298
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,800
you know, the 80-20 rule is a common thing.

299
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,560
But at some point after you've given them more than half, people start to think of it

300
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,760
as something that they're entitled to or something that already belongs to them.

301
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,000
And so instead of looking at what you're giving them, they're paying more attention to what

302
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,560
you're not giving them.

303
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,840
Oh, interesting.

304
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:31,160
So it's sort of like what Matt was saying, it's one part expectations and two part what

305
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,040
have you done for me lately?

306
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,840
Yeah, it is.

307
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,920
And as people have mentioned on my blog, there's another aspect of that and that's, you know,

308
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,600
what direction are you changing in?

309
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:47,320
I mean, if somebody goes from giving 10% to giving 20%, that's better than somebody who's

310
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,680
gone from giving 90% to giving 80%.

311
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,880
And that's a valid criticism of my original blog post is that the direction of change

312
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,920
does matter as much as where you're currently at.

313
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,920
Sure, sure.

314
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,360
But I think this is fascinating in the recent light of Firefox's announcement of enabling

315
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,160
ads on their new tab page.

316
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,480
And part of it, like Matt made a very good point last on Sunday, that part of it is honestly

317
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,160
how they announced it.

318
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:20,760
And part of it is I think that the phenomenon that you're writing about on your blog is

319
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,440
that, wait a minute, you're telling me I've gotten this thing all this time for absolutely

320
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,680
free, with no ads attached.

321
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,920
You guys are the anti NSA, anti ad tracking cookie organization on the internet and now

322
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,120
you want to ram ads down my throat?

323
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,600
How dare you?

324
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,760
This maybe while it doesn't surprise all of us, Michael, how do you combat something like

325
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
that?

326
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
Because Firefox has got to make money.

327
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,800
What can Firefox do?

328
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
It's really a tough question.

329
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,220
I mean, obviously it's a question that we've been trying to figure out in Canonical also.

330
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,220
And I think a lot of it is getting the messaging right.

331
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,320
But a lot of it is just the community needs to understand that every project is going

332
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
to have missteps.

333
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,400
And if somebody has been doing 80, 90 percent right for so long, you have to be a little

334
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,840
more gentle when they have those missteps.

335
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,780
Well, let me give you an example.

336
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:21,280
So Linux Unplugged, this very show that we are currently recording at this very moment,

337
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,480
is a symptom of this problem that you're talking about.

338
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,040
I knew that I needed to make changes, even just from a creative expression standpoint,

339
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,760
to the Linux action show.

340
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,040
But I also knew that we had a really great product that was firing on all cylinders and

341
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,200
has a ton of runway still.

342
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,560
And I knew that if I changed that product to what this show is, there would be massive

343
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,920
upset.

344
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,480
And so my solution was to create an entirely new product.

345
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,120
Now that has been wildly successful for multiple reasons, but it was exactly this kind of pressure.

346
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,720
And we made the mistake years ago with the Linux action show when we decided to broaden

347
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,940
the scope and change it to the computer action show.

348
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:10,560
And we basically took a beating for an entire season over that decision because we had changed

349
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,680
the product.

350
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:17,280
And the problem is, is at some times, at some level, you've got to change the product.

351
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,880
Apple, they changed the product with Final Cut.

352
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,000
They changed the product with the Mac Pro.

353
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,720
Two recent products from Apple that are used in professional industries, completely gutted

354
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,880
and redesigned from the ground up with less functionality, but yet in the long term will

355
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,560
probably be better off for it.

356
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,080
As somebody who uses Final Cut for editing, I can tell you, everybody who uses Final Cut

357
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,320
10 as crap hasn't used it recently.

358
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
I just recently went back to the old Final Cut.

359
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,560
It's like going back to the 90s.

360
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,540
It's like when you've been using Gnome 3 or Unity and you go back to Gnome 2, it feels

361
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,240
like you've gone back in time.

362
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,000
And sometimes, a lopping off like this, a major change, implementing ads, implementing

363
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,360
the Amazon search scope is necessary for the sustainability of the project.

364
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,880
The very people who depend on the project are then the ones that turn around on the

365
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,960
project and attack them.

366
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,020
What can a project do, do you think, in your opinion, to communicate that change better

367
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,560
so that way they can sort of preempt some of that attack?

368
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,720
So a lot of it has to do with the messaging that goes into it.

369
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,720
But another thing that I've noticed that I didn't really expand on in my blog is that

370
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,580
there's a difference in reaction between people who are just users of the project and people

371
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,040
who are contributors of the project.

372
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,380
And people who are contributing seem to be more understanding, be more willing to work

373
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:42,960
out an ideal solution instead of just jumping on the, oh my god, you're evil now bandwagon.

374
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,160
So I guess what I don't understand is why can a company, just using my example I set

375
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,000
up here, why can a company like Apple reboot something, cut away tons of functionality,

376
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,240
and be called an innovator, but if an open source project does the same thing, they're

377
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,200
crazy, they've lost their way, they're evil, they're whatever people are accusing, Canonical

378
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,640
or Mozilla of that week.

379
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,360
It seems to me, Canonical has people that deal with PR, they've got a pretty good presence

380
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,520
online, and yet they have been unable to get in front of this.

381
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,200
Mozilla, same thing, they have an entire crew that works there, and they were still unable

382
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,320
to get in front of this.

383
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,400
Matt, I want to ask you, because I know you've worked in this space before, what are these

384
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,160
people missing?

385
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,760
What is Mozilla missing in this case?

386
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,760
What did they do wrong?

387
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,000
What should they have done before the news came out?

388
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,520
Well, the big difference between Mozilla and Apple is Apple sells experiences, Mozilla

389
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
offers a browser.

390
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,360
A lot of people think that Apple is a computer company or a technology company.

391
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
They're not.

392
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,920
They're a PR company, pure and simple.

393
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,160
They've mastered this years ago.

394
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,040
They could literally be like, hey, we have this iHome invasion thing where we're going

395
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,960
to come in and basically invade your house and ransack everything you own.

396
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,000
People are going to be excited about it because they can present it in a way that's attractive.

397
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,980
What Mozilla needed to do when they came out with their whole advertising thing for browsers

398
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,640
and what not is they really needed to get in front of this and say, here's our rationale.

399
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,000
Here's how we've been supporting ourselves thus far.

400
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,440
Here's what we're challenged with.

401
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,160
This is what we're planning on doing.

402
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,160
We would like to have an open forum debate about this and actually get all the questions

403
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,200
out in the open and really have a conversation about it, but at the same time, we need you

404
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,400
to understand why we're doing it, why it is or is not a threat, why you should or should

405
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,440
not be concerned, and to quit treating people like they need to be talked at and actually

406
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,600
talk to them.

407
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,520
It's something that historically geekier companies don't do real well at.

408
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,040
Google, Mozilla, two real big offenders in that space, probably Google being the worst.

409
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,880
I see it over and over and it's something that's not really addressed very well.

410
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,720
I've seen other companies do this as well, but I'd say Apple, honestly, as much as I'm

411
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,280
not a big fan of their company, they can spin anything.

412
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Right.

413
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,320
They control the narrative from the very beginning.

414
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
Absolutely.

415
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
Props to import.

416
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
I mean, really.

417
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
They know how to do it.

418
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,280
But other than everybody yelling at how horrible Apple is about it, let's look at what they're

419
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
doing right.

420
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,000
I mean, the products aren't kind of meh, but as far as their marketing techniques, come

421
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
on.

422
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's get with it.

423
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,400
So, Michael, what do you think about like, so if we don't have the means and resources

424
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,600
of a company like Apple, these smaller, even Mozilla would fall into the smaller category.

425
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,800
What about being just more direct?

426
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,880
And I'm not asking you as a representative canonical here.

427
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,380
I'm asking just your personal opinion of somebody who's been following open source for many

428
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,520
years now.

429
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,400
Do you think that if a company like Canonical come out and said, hey, we're doing these

430
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,000
Amazon placements in our dashboard results because, honestly, we got to generate a revenue

431
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,140
from the desktop in order to keep it sustainable?

432
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,620
Or if Mozilla had come out, maybe let's take a more recent example.

433
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,880
If Mozilla had come out and said, look, guys, we can't have all our eggs in the Google basket.

434
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,200
We respect our relationship with Google and we appreciate the financing they've given

435
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,760
us so far, but we've got to diversify because this browser is more important than one contract

436
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
with one company.

437
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,080
And we've got to implement these ads to come up with a new source of revenue.

438
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,420
If they had just been totally straight, plain English like that, do you think things would

439
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,320
have gone over better?

440
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
I think it would have helped.

441
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,440
But I mean, you're always going to have people who would rather see your project go down

442
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,680
in flames than have you backtrack a little bit from their ideal.

443
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,360
And you're always going to deal with that.

444
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,060
There's no way to explain things sufficiently for those people.

445
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:25,760
But one thing we did do, when we came out with the Amazon lens in 12.10, it just kind

446
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,840
of landed out of the blue with no explanation of why it was there or what it does.

447
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,500
And we're still dealing with that even today.

448
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,160
But then the next release, we came out with the broader SmartScope service.

449
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,400
And we came out first with a public spec on our Wiki.

450
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,200
We held multiple Google Hangouts that were recorded explaining what the feature was going

451
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,520
to be and what it was going to do and how it's going to work.

452
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
And the security improvements.

453
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
Yeah.

454
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,960
And the security improvements.

455
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,880
And that certainly helped.

456
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:04,320
I mean, if you can get the narrative right from the start, that helps.

457
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,240
As soon as the FUD comes in and establishes itself, you're going to spend all of your

458
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
time just trying to-

459
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
Fighting that.

460
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
Yeah.

461
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Just trying to fight that.

462
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Yeah.

463
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Yeah.

464
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Boy, that is a really well-taken point.

465
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,720
And I wish there was a way to sort of reinforce this with the open source community.

466
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,840
Because I'll give you another recent example I talked about on Coda Radio yesterday.

467
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,480
I want to say friend of the show, although he's never come on.

468
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
I'd love to have him join us.

469
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,200
But Martin, who is responsible for the Kaywin project, he continues to battle this problem.

470
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,120
We talked about it several weeks ago here on the show, where the media grabs a headline

471
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,240
from the KDE mailing list and just runs with it.

472
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,160
And we inaccurately reported that the KDE Next release date.

473
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,740
But more recently, and because of my lessons learned, did not run it in last, thankfully.

474
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:59,560
But more recently, Ferronix ran a story that the KDE search system, it was a waste of money

475
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,780
and that it's being abandoned in favor of something completely else, which is inaccurate

476
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,780
in total.

477
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,200
And of course, not everything is being abandoned.

478
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,760
And of course, Recode is going to be repurposed.

479
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,480
But again, they're fighting a battle that you just touched on, Michael, where they're

480
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,640
responding to a narrative that somebody else created for them.

481
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,840
And this is happening more and more for open source projects because, and this goes back

482
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,760
to something else I've been really getting on recently, the coverage in Linux and the

483
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,980
open source space is going downhill.

484
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:34,200
It's becoming industrialized and it's not original reporting, it's reposting based on

485
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,480
what a corporation wants you to post and it's getting worse and there's agendas involved

486
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,720
and it's getting to the point where not all of the information is coming out and the press

487
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,760
is not giving the actual narrative a chance to get aired out.

488
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,520
The only narratives that are getting repeated by the media are the ones that get created

489
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
first.

490
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,640
And this is a massive problem that is plaguing Linux and open source and it affects the way

491
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,080
the entire open source community perceives events, I believe.

492
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,720
And I think it's one of the things that I want to set out to help correct on our platforms

493
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,760
any shows that we have is that I want to try to give the actual real narrative a chance

494
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,840
to get some air time because nobody else seems to be doing it.

495
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,880
And that's why I really, that's why I wanted to bring you on Michael because I really appreciate

496
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,760
the fact that you're, even if, you know, there are some things I could disagree with on your

497
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,060
post here and you've actually generated a very active discussion on our subreddit.

498
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,200
People are taking issue with minimizing the CLA and things like that.

499
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,360
But I want to save the CLA discussion for a future episode.

500
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,360
I'll just say, I want to thank you for bringing this topic out to a broader discussion because

501
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:41,200
I think the problem really has to be solved with the actual consumers of these open source

502
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
projects.

503
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,920
It is our responsibility to consider the long term viability of these projects.

504
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,680
I extend that to our own projects and our advertisers and why we have ad supported media

505
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,320
because that makes it sustainable.

506
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,640
I think we have to consider the software we consider valuable and when they make changes

507
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,600
we have to understand that sometimes they're doing it for their best interest in the case

508
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,120
of the Mozilla project and perhaps even in the case of the Dash Lens results.

509
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,080
And I think in that context your post, while I think there's plenty of things people could

510
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,240
quibble with, it definitely provokes some interesting thoughts.

511
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,280
So thank you for coming on Linux Unplugged today.

512
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,800
Is there anything else you wanted to touch on before we wrap up?

513
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,200
No, I think that's it.

514
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
Oh welcome back friends to the bunker.

515
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
It's good down here.

516
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,840
It's starting to smell a little bit.

517
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,360
So I think that's Ricai.

518
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,400
I'm not trying to say my ass doesn't stink but that doesn't smell like mine.

519
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,480
I know what mine smells like.

520
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,840
Hey you know what else I know?

521
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,400
Digital Ocean and they freaking rock.

522
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,680
That's why I know Digital Ocean.

523
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,840
They're keeping our bunker online.

524
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,120
They're also keeping the rest of the world online while we're down here.

525
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,320
I don't even know what's going on up there right now but I know my droplets run all the

526
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
time.

527
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,400
I've never even experienced an outage and Digital Ocean has some great, great systems

528
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,400
for you to deploy right now that run Linux powered by KVM all on top of the sweetest

529
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,800
hardware you could ever imagine.

530
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,960
It's a thrill just to use it.

531
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,640
You go over to digitalocean.com and I want you to arm yourself with a little bit of knowledge.

532
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
Okay?

533
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Are you ready for this?

534
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Because this knowledge is going to save you money.

535
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
I'm all about that.

536
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,280
I want you to go play around.

537
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,840
I don't want you to have to pay for it.

538
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,920
So use this knowledge right now.

539
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
You ready?

540
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Open the spot up in your brain.

541
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,920
Put it in the vault.

542
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,920
DO unplugged.

543
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
All lowercase.

544
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,920
One word.

545
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
DO unplugged.

546
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
One word.

547
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Ten dollar credit over Digital Ocean.

548
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
You put that in the vault now.

549
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,960
I'm going to tell you about Digital Ocean and then you remember that's why Chris had

550
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
me put it in the vault.

551
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Digital Ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

552
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
easy way for you.

553
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,600
You to spin up your own cloud server.

554
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,360
You're going to have root access to that bad mamma jamma.

555
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,560
It's going to be sitting on top of Linux boxes on tier one hardware.

556
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,120
It's just so sweet with fantastic bandwidth and all on SSDs.

557
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,560
I mean it's great.

558
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
It's so great.

559
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,260
You can get started in less than a minute and pricing plans start only five dollars

560
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,320
a month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer.

561
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,320
A terabyte of freaking transfer.

562
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,480
I mean I've got my own cloud up on one of these things.

563
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,200
I never go close to that.

564
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,340
Digital Ocean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam

565
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,340
and London.

566
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,040
They're gorgeous data centers.

567
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,640
As somebody who's put up a lot of really messy data centers that I'm totally ashamed of and

568
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,180
would never want to take a picture of because the wiring mess is absolutely a rat's nest

569
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,260
of disaster.

570
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,040
When I see what they build over at Digital Ocean by checking out their Instagram feed

571
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,040
I'm like oh shoot.

572
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,680
Oh shoot they're showing me up.

573
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
Digital Ocean totally shows me up.

574
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,800
Go look at their data center port on their Instagram feed and then check out that interface.

575
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,240
This is really the masterpiece.

576
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,160
This is where it all comes together.

577
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,240
This is like the icing on top.

578
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,280
Their interface is so simple but powerful.

579
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,040
It can get anything done you want, backups, snapshots, redeployments, DNS management,

580
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,760
one click applications, destroying machines, changing the root password, HTML5 access all

581
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,960
the way from post to your login screen.

582
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
And the best part?

583
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,240
They have an API you can use and that API just basically replicates all of the function

584
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,000
but you know you want to snap it into your puppet system, go ahead.

585
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You can do that.

586
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,020
You know you just want to write a bash script that'll deploy machines when you need to scale.

587
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
You can do that.

588
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,760
Or you can be like me and just take advantage of the tons of great things that the community

589
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,040
already builds.

590
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,280
It's really sweet.

591
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,840
Digital Ocean also has a ton of great tutorials.

592
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Check them out.

593
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,840
They're good for everybody.

594
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,300
I mean it's just Linux commands and they're always adding more as well.

595
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,680
So remember, DO Unplugged.

596
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
That's one word.

597
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
DO Unplugged.

598
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
You're going to get a $10 credit.

599
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,560
You can go try out that $5 rig.

600
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,600
Two months, no credit card required and my gosh what a thrill it is.

601
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
DigitalOcean.com.

602
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Go over there.

603
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Try it out right now.

604
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,760
Thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

605
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,200
It is keeping the lights on down in the bunker.

606
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,880
Now we return you back to our retro extravaganza.

607
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,880
So I'm going to pull Aaron back down into our private little room here and hopefully

608
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,740
he wasn't in the middle of saying something to the group.

609
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,440
So Aaron, let's talk a little bit about, you got kind of fired up when you were watching

610
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,360
the episode that we did recently in Defense of Gnome and I think you really called me

611
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,120
out on something that I was actually sort of kicking myself for.

612
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,040
And that was sort of the celebration of new and shiny and rebuilt to have a rebuilt purpose.

613
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,920
And you sort of brought up this counterpoint and said, well, what about this methodology

614
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,040
of refinement and evolution and working with something and staying with it for a while

615
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,200
and building on top of a platform, building on top of something.

616
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,720
And that isn't almost in some cases really even respected in the community.

617
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,040
What are your thoughts and share a little bit about what got you fired up?

618
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
Sure.

619
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,520
So just to make it clear for everybody right off the top, I'm not wearing my KDE hat at

620
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,160
all here.

621
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,600
This is really me with my free software must rule the world one day hat on.

622
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:30,280
And it's this exact idea that, yeah, you know, new and shiny is awesome.

623
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,680
And yeah, I mean, it is new and shiny is awesome.

624
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,520
But there's cost to everything that we do in new and shiny.

625
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,160
Every rewrite, every new adventure comes with a cost.

626
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:49,080
So when you make a bunch of applications and you decide we're just going to redo them all,

627
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:57,000
you end up with, you know, being able to get the first 90 percent of functionality or 80

628
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,360
percent of functionality fairly quickly.

629
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,080
And then you spend, you know, the rest of the 90 percent of the development time getting

630
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,240
the 10 to 20 percent that people actually need for it to become a reasonable application.

631
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,280
And when we toss these things aside, you know, applications that work and that have reached

632
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:20,560
this point of maturity, what we might do is we might deliver something with marginally

633
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,560
better visuals or a slightly better workflow.

634
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:30,480
But in the meantime, our users tend to be left with locations that don't have the features

635
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,280
they need.

636
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,120
And what happens from a developer's point of view, who works on free software quite

637
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:44,140
a bit, there is a real constant pressure from a lot of people, especially the attention

638
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,680
areas of our community, you know, the media and whatnot, to always be producing something

639
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,060
new and flashy and cool.

640
00:31:53,060 --> 00:32:00,500
And it's more reward for promising something wonderful and starting off by scrapping whatever

641
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,360
you have right now.

642
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:08,720
At the same time, we also get our feet held to the fire if it isn't stable and if it isn't

643
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,320
performant and if it doesn't have the features that people need.

644
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,480
You're talking earlier about, you know, is the Linux desktop ready for the average person?

645
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,560
Well, it never will be if we keep reinventing things every few years.

646
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,680
And so there's this conflict, right?

647
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,520
These two motivations don't really jowl well together.

648
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:33,200
And this is both part of what new free software developers coming into it are bred and born

649
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
on.

650
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,880
So they come into it with this expectation of, oh, we need to redo things so it's sexy

651
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,560
and cool or go the other way and be hyper conservative.

652
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
There's no middle ground.

653
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:49,560
And meanwhile, those projects that try and hit a middle ground, I think, come under a

654
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:56,960
lot of unnecessary pressure on the one hand, but also just get overlooked a lot for trying

655
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,400
to be going through cycles of innovation, but then also going through longer cycles

656
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,160
of stability and support.

657
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:07,880
So just to kind of track this to a level where people would kind of recognize it down to

658
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,040
the desktop, I would say, for me, I do kind of understand what you're saying in the sense

659
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:20,040
that I look at the GNOME desktop and their reboot has cost them, I believe, not only

660
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,320
untold users, but years of basically progress on the desktop.

661
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,600
I would say that while they've obviously been working very hard, it's really now getting

662
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,880
to a point where I'm comfortable using it on a daily basis.

663
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
That wasn't...

664
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,840
I mean, if you look at the years it took to get there, that's a big reset, and it kind

665
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,320
of came at an inappropriate time, right when Microsoft was stumbling with Vista.

666
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,320
There was sort of...

667
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,800
I've always felt like this golden opportunity where Linux could have succeeded a little

668
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:50,840
bit stronger, where perhaps if Canonical hadn't rebooted with Unity, and Unity was really

669
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,520
quite awful at the beginning, and if GNOME hadn't restarted with GNOME 3, which GNOME

670
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,980
3.0 was really quite unusable at the beginning, we might have had a little more traction perhaps.

671
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,840
So then you look at it now, and these projects are getting to a good state, but one of them

672
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,320
is about to face another reboot.

673
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,280
And I see there's projects where sometimes there'd be value in starting over, and then

674
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,560
there's other projects where I see it almost feels a little sad because so much effort

675
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,820
and time will be lost while they rebuild and retrace things that they have already once

676
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,240
completed and already once figured out.

677
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,480
Exactly, and when these projects get to the point of, okay, finally they're usable again,

678
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:36,040
I can use them on a daily basis, have they really progressed the technology sufficiently

679
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,720
to offset that cost?

680
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:45,080
And I think with the wild abandon that we embrace new and shiny with at times, we tend

681
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,400
to destroy that.

682
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,240
I mean, the biggest problem I had with something like PulseAudio, for instance, was not that

683
00:34:52,240 --> 00:35:00,680
we needed a non-crappy audio stack, but that it was pushed onto the user community when

684
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:09,000
it wasn't ready can be clearly seen by years of troubles that people had.

685
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,280
There was literally a distribution that shipped where the volume slider didn't do anything.

686
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,840
As crappy as the Linux audio stack was, it finally worked for most people.

687
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Yeah, exactly.

688
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:22,360
And so we seem to be, as you said, picking really bad times to reinvent things and doing

689
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:29,120
it for what will deliver marginal benefit, if any, at the end of the day.

690
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,040
See here's the thing, it's this interesting culture that's driven, and I feel like it's

691
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,320
more than just one thing that attributes to this, but from a media production standpoint,

692
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,120
like from the Linux action show, people are going to be much more interested in something

693
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:47,400
brand new that they want to learn about than sort of retracing how great it is that every

694
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,200
application I use under KDE has a proper notification icon on the system tray.

695
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,560
That's an example of how staying stable and just having something and defining the way

696
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,600
it works and keeping it that way for years benefits end users, but it doesn't make for

697
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,120
a good segment in a podcast and it doesn't make for a good article on a blog.

698
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,400
And so I do agree that that is driving the conversation in one direction, but at the

699
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,200
same time that's because that's what the consumers of that content want to hear about, right?

700
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,560
And the developers that are going into these projects, they don't want to work on the old

701
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,040
guys old busted code, they want to come up with their new hot concepts and bring those

702
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
on the world.

703
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
So that's their motivation.

704
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,320
It's like this multi-dimensional problem that just sort of is maybe human nature.

705
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,920
No, I agree.

706
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,480
And so on the one hand, we need to not reward those developers who just want to come in

707
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,800
with a wrecking ball or at least reward them a lot less for doing that if they're not bringing

708
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,000
any real large offsetting value to it.

709
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,700
The other side of it is, yeah, how do we present mature projects as interesting?

710
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:57,680
And I agree it requires a little more positioning and thinking and most free software projects

711
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,440
and most people involved in free software are not great self promoters and marketers.

712
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,620
And so yeah, I completely get that new is an easier story, it writes itself.

713
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:11,840
On the other hand, if you look at, so a product that I've been involved with for years was

714
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,000
Plasma, which most people know as a desktop environment.

715
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,880
And it gets to the point where it's mature enough that we can actually start branching

716
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,180
off and doing things like Plasma Active where we can bring in devices.

717
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,800
And this whole convergence story that has been really exciting for people around Unity

718
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,520
is actually where we were three or four years ago.

719
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,160
Now the question is, why didn't that story get out in a more interesting way?

720
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,960
Why doesn't it keep people's attention?

721
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,760
And I'm sure there's probably things that I could have done differently or better to

722
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,200
make it more interesting.

723
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,160
But on the other hand, I also think that there's a kind of an expectation you can only tell

724
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
a story once.

725
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,920
And I think that the convergence story, for example, is one that has a lot of legs if

726
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,160
we can keep ourselves kind of moderately entertained and interested.

727
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,520
And companies like Google, for instance, there's a bunch of people talking pre-show about things

728
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,480
like Chromebooks.

729
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,680
And what we don't realize with these things is that, or I don't think consciously, is

730
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,840
that they bang on the same boring message for like five years before people get it.

731
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,440
And when people get it, it's new and exciting to them.

732
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,440
But you have to bang those old messages through.

733
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,960
And I think that hurts the free software adoption as well because we don't have the patience

734
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,920
to bang the message through.

735
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,460
That usually takes two, three years.

736
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:39,200
And so what happens is we get projects that are less interesting to people.

737
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,200
And until someone comes along with the wrecking ball and erects the new Shiny that is not

738
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,120
usable anymore, they don't get the attention.

739
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,400
And so we kind of catch ourselves in the spiral.

740
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,840
You also have these companies that some people in the development communities idolize, Apple,

741
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,360
where you'll see Apple from time to time completely reboot a product, even if it's a high-end

742
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,560
product like Final Cut or the Mac Pro, into something brand new and just say, suck it.

743
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,000
You take it or you don't take it, and this is the way it is.

744
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,440
And I think in some weird, creepy way that messages to people that that's an OK thing

745
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
to do.

746
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,600
You see Apple doing it and some people hold that in some level of regard.

747
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,880
And so it seems to me too that there is a bit of commercial...

748
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,680
The commercial companies like Google and Apple are also sort of driving this mentality a

749
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,680
bit.

750
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,340
And it takes a certain wisdom to sort of see past that and be still motivated to work on

751
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,040
something that is tried and true.

752
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,320
How do you incentivize somebody to want to do that?

753
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:47,160
Well, I think that most tried and true software, how do I say this politely, has areas that

754
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,280
suck after a number of years.

755
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,400
Software doesn't stand up to the test of time if you don't change it.

756
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,920
And so right now I'm involved in rerunning one small part of a project that I'm involved

757
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,800
with that's...

758
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:14,520
It's a rewrite of one small component and it's very interesting and it will bring important

759
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,920
value to the users.

760
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,760
It's not a rewrite of everything.

761
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,600
So I think on the one hand, finding ways to create a culture of you don't have to rewrite

762
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
everything.

763
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,280
Make your software a little bit more modular with a more forward looking design, which

764
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,400
is something that we need to teach each other how to do.

765
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,240
And then you can do incremental important evolutionary work where you can talk about

766
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
it.

767
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,680
I mean, my blogs in the last two weeks have featured quite a few times this component

768
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,800
that I'm rewriting and people are finding it very interesting and exciting.

769
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,400
And it's done in a very low risk way.

770
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,240
The other thing is that there are tons of topics that free software does not touch,

771
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,040
does not cover.

772
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,640
We don't need to be rewriting the image viewer application every two years.

773
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:07,160
Let that topic area go and let's find the other 8 million application categories that

774
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:14,240
we have no answer for and create a new shiny there instead of just chasing our tails.

775
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,160
So maybe that's just me.

776
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,160
Maybe we actually do have a complete software catalog, but last time I checked we didn't.

777
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:28,480
Well, so I guess if you kind of zoom out a little bit and you look at the whole free

778
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,840
software ecosystem, there's certain aspects of like Linux itself have had pretty even

779
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,960
curved development and stability and also innovation.

780
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,920
The Linux kernel has then been adopted by every company under the sun to power their

781
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,880
product and I think that speaks to sort of what you're talking about when you have a

782
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,000
group of people that just stay at it and keep building it.

783
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,620
Don't keep throwing it all out and restarting again.

784
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,480
It gives people certain assurances.

785
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,160
But because that hasn't happened really at the user space as much, we haven't seen a

786
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,120
stabilizing there.

787
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:05,760
And so you see these, we had a great thread in the Linux action show subreddit saying

788
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,880
why has Linux on the desktop failed?

789
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,880
He looks at, this was Ersk in the chat room, he looks at the market shares.

790
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,040
Linux is at 1.73% according to NetMarketShare.com and he says, regardless of the distro, it's

791
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,480
at 1.73% while XP is 12 years later still at 29% market share.

792
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,600
One of the reasons this could be the popularity of XP in Asia of course and things like that,

793
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,720
but honestly XP was this quote unquote stable in terms of it's an easy target for developers

794
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,960
to quantify, develop for.

795
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,880
And I wonder if perhaps, remember when Miguel Itacazo wrote that the problem with the Linux

796
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,640
desktop was always changing and always incompatibilities always being brought in.

797
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,160
I wonder if he sort of nailed it in a sense where like what we really need is something,

798
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,040
now I know I'm just going to sound like I'm blowing smoke up the KDE project, but we need

799
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:01,440
something like KDE 4.x that is just what you see is what you get for years.

800
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,440
Like it's like this for, it's snapshotted like this for years, much like Unity will

801
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,940
be in the current, in the next LTS release.

802
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,720
Does Linux need a little XP-ification right now?

803
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:20,720
I think so and this can be done without ossifying or fossilizing things either.

804
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,400
Now you brought the Linux kernel, I completely agree with what you said about it and why

805
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
it's successful.

806
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,320
The thing, but the Linux kernel is like this massive constant churn, so it's not like they're

807
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,480
sitting still and moribund, they've managed to marry the two.

808
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,480
So a really good example I think of this in the user space is so we've had the whole many

809
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:48,820
years of Udev, U disks, basically the hot plug and disk management facing the user space

810
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:55,080
side has gone through a number of revolutions and not always, in fact at each break it was

811
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,680
a radical API change.

812
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:05,940
So what the KDE developers did was they decided to create an API that did what application

813
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,520
developers could wrap their head around because the lower level user space APIs were also

814
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:16,360
pretty hardcore for the average person who just wants to write a cool game or something.

815
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,360
So they created a slightly simplified API but they masked what was going on down below

816
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:27,480
and this yes, it's opened up the ability to port to Windows and Mac and now iOS and Android.

817
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:34,380
But when the U disk thing came in while other desktop environments like XFCE for instance

818
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:39,280
had to do a lot of work to catch up their applications and rewrite them, no KDE application

819
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,800
had to line a code, a new backend was written for that framework called Solid and everything

820
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,160
just continued working.

821
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,540
Even more magical, no one got left behind because the people who were using the old

822
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:55,360
stuff used the old backend and the people using the new stuff used the new backend and

823
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,680
no one was stranded on an old version.

824
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:04,360
So it is possible to do but it takes forethought and I think that Miguel de Caso was correct

825
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:10,640
in his criticism or his critique except that we do have projects and communities out there

826
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,560
that do exactly what he said we should be doing.

827
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:19,440
And the challenge we face is that the community as a whole on the one hand I don't think recognizes

828
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,200
that.

829
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,200
When someone does something like Solid, there's a certain community or group of people in

830
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,580
the community who hurl stones saying you're just writing yet another abstraction layer

831
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:35,400
and you should be writing to the Linux stack directly and that's the way to go.

832
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:41,080
And so there's a popular backlash against doing the responsible thing and I think as

833
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,440
a community we need to take stock of what really matters.

834
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:51,120
And if we do want to get that stable, approachable user land and especially at the GUI level,

835
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,040
we need to start valuing that kind of work that isn't very glamorous but pays off in

836
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,160
the long run and we need to start supporting those people.

837
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,640
And the people who don't do that, maybe we should say look I love you guys and you guys

838
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:08,220
are doing free software which is freaking awesome but you know what?

839
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,600
We need you to do it responsibly and so we're going to go over here and support these people

840
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,560
that are looking at five, ten years down the road.

841
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,960
And I think if we did that, if we shifted what we value, everybody would start doing

842
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,600
things a little more responsibly and then I think the whole new shiny thing would resolve

843
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:29,040
itself because people tend to do by and large that which is rewarded.

844
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,000
Matt, let me ask you the million dollar question and then I'll open it up to the mumble room.

845
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,760
How do we shift the end user's value which would hopefully then influence developers

846
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,600
and media coverage, how do we shift the value from new and shiny to tried and true?

847
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,820
Well I think the opportunity definitely lays with XP.

848
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:49,840
The problem is that the end user looks at XP not realizing the fact that it's going

849
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,920
to be a major problem here in the coming months and doesn't see a reason to switch.

850
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,960
But I think if you speak to the fact that they could potentially continue to use the

851
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,520
hardware they already have without having to invest in new hardware, I think money is

852
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,320
really going to be the sweet spot.

853
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:09,080
Yeah I think the point you're driving at here is there's a certain class of user that absolutely

854
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,720
values tried and true and then there's a certain class of user, the more sophisticated user

855
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,320
who maybe is a little more on the I want the shiny, right?

856
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,320
Exactly.

857
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,320
That's exactly it.

858
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,520
And I think that it's really hard to hit that nail on the head but I think the biggest problem

859
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,040
Linux has for both groups is they really suck at marketing.

860
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,520
I mean I can't stress that enough.

861
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:36,080
They have this amazing product that is driven through very much an echo chamber world.

862
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,000
I mean it really is and it's a shame because like I introduce it to people and they're

863
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
just blown away as to why the hell they've never heard of this before and they have an

864
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Android phone.

865
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,040
They have no idea.

866
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,200
So it's interesting.

867
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:51,120
So it's going to be tough to say for sure but I definitely say that it's going to be

868
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,880
the real opportunity for growth that's going to come from the people that are using XP.

869
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,920
I think that's really where it is.

870
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,080
The new and shiny people honestly I don't know.

871
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,520
Maybe they're always going to want new and shiny.

872
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,800
Yeah that's like trying to herd cats.

873
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:00,800
I don't know about that.

874
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:11,200
Well I think we can do both but I do completely agree with you Matt when you say that people

875
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:18,080
who want the tried and true, how do we market to them?

876
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,760
And that's the gap, the marketing bit.

877
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,520
And this is kind of what tweets me when I listen to your show and I'm often like one

878
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,600
or two weeks behind that I've been on the Linux action show to catch up.

879
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,560
And it's what tweets me about it right was it was like you guys are the people who market

880
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:41,840
us best because we do suck at it, full stop.

881
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:47,900
And so when I see people who would be our best and brightest in terms of getting the

882
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:54,600
message out of marketing, rewarding really and for good intentions I think the new and

883
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,480
shiny because you all want to support and push for everything.

884
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,880
I mean nobody wants to be the grumpy guy who goes well you're really putting your heart

885
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,480
and soul into this and I can see that and you're doing this free software but really

886
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,200
no one wants to be that guy.

887
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,200
I get it.

888
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,000
But if we want to succeed there is some level of responsibility that needs to come in and

889
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,640
the people who do the best marketing for us who is not me and the other software developers,

890
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:26,380
we need you guys and not just you two but the media in general who follows free software

891
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,380
to do it.

892
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:32,880
And what goes even one step further of pain and heartache is when I read certain people

893
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,460
in the media who cover free software basically going fine, okay great.

894
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:41,240
The free software projects will never get together and again this is a systems thing

895
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,880
because we've been rewarding the wrong things all along, fine.

896
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,520
And now I'm just going to say that Google with their services are where it will be and

897
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,640
to me that feels like just running the white flag straight up the flagpole and unnecessarily

898
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:01,320
and I just I'd love to find some way to break that feedback loop so that we can start rewarding

899
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:07,080
strategically useful behavior and then getting that message out to those people who would

900
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,840
most benefit from it such as the XP crowd.

901
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:17,260
It's not an easy thing that I realize that's a gigantic thing to take on but I think that's

902
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:20,520
the path of success lies in that direction somehow.

903
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,520
Very good.

904
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,520
That's a good point.

905
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,880
It's well taken on my end too because it's something that it's definitely on my radar

906
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,400
because I always cringe a little bit when like you say I have that same feeling.

907
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,420
It's like okay it's good that you're doing this and I really appreciate the hard work

908
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:38,960
and especially in the Gnome case it's like for years everybody's been so hard on them.

909
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,360
Like okay they've finally gotten it to a state to a point that it's okay it's worth talking

910
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,720
about now it's really gotten good but at the same time like in the back of my mind it's

911
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:51,360
like you know I'm I do understand that I'm sort of encouraging like I called it a form

912
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,960
of consumerism and I'm not generally comfortable with those all those kinds of things.

913
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,400
Oh hey guys.

914
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,400
We weren't.

915
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,840
Rekai put that out Rekai put that out man they can smell it and we weren't doing nothing

916
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,560
down here we're just hanging out.

917
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,240
Oh you guys still watching that retro thing?

918
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,400
Hey well I got you for a second can I tell you about how good the Ting service is down

919
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,400
here in the bunker?

920
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,960
I mean Ting is incredible and Ting is a sponsor of the Linux Unplugged Show in fact you can

921
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,080
get in on some of that goodness by going to linux.ting.com so not only does linux.ting.com

922
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,540
support this here show but it's going to get you a $25 discount off your first Ting device

923
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:30,760
that matters and it also if you've got a Ting compatible device you can bring your own device

924
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,040
well they're going to give you a $25 credit so you're going to win either way and you

925
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,200
support the Linux Unplugged Show.

926
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,200
Now what is Ting?

927
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:42,180
My mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider Ting is mobile that makes

928
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:46,320
sense because there's no contract there's no early termination fee but the big one for

929
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:51,240
me is I'm only paying for what I use it's flat six dollars for each line and then you

930
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,080
just pay for your usage on top of that Ting will just add that up and that's what you

931
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,160
pay at the end of the month so I've got three lines I've got an HTC one I've got an iPhone

932
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:03,600
5 and I have got my Nexus 5 and on there I usually pay somewhere in the range of 35 to

933
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,320
40 dollars for all three lines all smartphones they're all ready to go with hotspot and tethering

934
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,440
you just turn it on when you want it they have an incredible dashboard that allows you

935
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,240
to manage all of that and they have no hold customer service you can call and talk to

936
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:20,360
a real human between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. East Coast time you call them one eight five five

937
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,640
Ting FTW and a real person answers the phone they got a great range of devices value devices

938
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,880
like flip phones all the way up to like the best the best or you can just get a SIM and

939
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,320
just go grab like a Nexus 6 from the Google Play Store and put it in there and the dashboard

940
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,280
really brings it all together they've got mobile apps they've got a very fantastic web

941
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,240
app that's web compliant they've really done a very good job with that and I think the

942
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,420
best thing about Ting is they're also a company that I'm pretty comfortable my money goes

943
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:50,480
to and I've never said that about a telco before but Ting isn't like a telco they're

944
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,740
they're mobile and they're different and so when I think about Ting I think it's you must

945
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:58,320
be very challenging being in this industry but yet being so different and they happen

946
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:06,440
to answer just that very question in a recent video Ryan asks what were the biggest challenges

947
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,120
in creating a wireless company what is the most difficult part of maintaining such low

948
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:18,400
rates for us the most difficult parts of building a wireless service were finding a good carrier

949
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:25,000
partner availability to offer the network and being able to initially build the systems

950
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,760
that supported what we're doing you really need a great back office to provide great

951
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:39,180
customer service so the easy part was conceiving of it imagining all of the bits and pieces

952
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:43,840
knowing that we wanted to provide a great customer experience you know the hard part

953
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:49,960
was really putting together the wiring now that that's together all of the challenge

954
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:56,160
is around getting as many people as possible on the platform linux.ting.com go get on

955
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,400
that platform finally put your money somewhere where maybe it doesn't make you want to hate

956
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,980
yourself a little bit linux.ting.com it truly is mobile that makes sense and I'll tell you

957
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:10,200
down here in the bunker we can't recommend any other mobile it is the best mobile provider

958
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,400
linux.ting.com also I know is mobile service provider for the Linux action show really

959
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,200
the whole team here at Jupiter Broadcasting has been using it and now that they're going

960
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:23,680
GSM as well shoot linux.ting.com go join up and start savings and check out their savings

961
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,840
calculator it's linked right there on the front page when you go to linux.ting.com and

962
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:31,940
that might just finally help you realize the difference also if you're having like a spousal

963
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:36,640
debate about it this giving numbers like this getting data on your difference you put in

964
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:40,160
your current usage you compare it to what ting would be and you know then they'll say

965
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,920
over the life of the two years this is what you're going to save and when you see that

966
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:50,360
number like I did and you see that number it's pretty easy to switch and they also have

967
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:55,000
an early termination relief program that makes it even better linux.ting.com big thanks to

968
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:01,680
ting for sponsoring the linux unplugged program I'm going to jump back into my cozy it's honestly

969
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,280
it's not that cozy it actually has a hole in it and I think Rekai spilled some chili

970
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,240
on it but I got nonetheless a sleeping bag I'm going to jump back in while you watch

971
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:17,000
the rest of the retrospective our last bit of feedback this week comes in from Dakota

972
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,160
Dakota writes in about Linux in schools and says I'm 15 years old I've been using Linux

973
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,200
for a year now I've done stuff from write my own code to compiling a custom kernel on

974
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:31,720
Ubuntu I think we as a community should start a petition to get open source into more schools

975
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,120
and like you talked about on unplugged with the same other teens I think the school should

976
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:40,760
actually teach you something useful if computer in the computer in IT classes it's really

977
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,600
sad when there are kids out there like me who can teach the class better than a teacher

978
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:49,520
you know that sentiment teaching the class better than the teacher which can come across

979
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:54,400
a little bit like the youngster knowing more than the teacher and you know these damn kids

980
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:00,120
but in the same sense like I remember one of the reasons I wasn't super spun up about

981
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:06,280
taking more college level courses is because I quickly felt like I was outflanking my teachers

982
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,760
and knew more than they did and it was frustrating when the teacher would incorrectly cover something

983
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:16,200
or say something wrong or use the wrong terminology or you know right system D with a capital

984
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,880
D or you know bad example but you know what I'm saying like it it is very frustrating

985
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,680
for these students so and essentially because we got a lot more emails and the ones I just

986
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,960
read on air and a lot of them iterated that point and there's a situation a trend of young

987
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,760
people saying hey you know don't don't give up on our generation we're here we're talking

988
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,760
we're sharing we're teaching others that are willing to learn maybe not the teachers but

989
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:42,120
right you know certainly other students I'm almost coming to the conclusion that I think

990
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:47,420
the future of Linux on the desktop in a non-enterprise situations perhaps at home will be with young

991
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:51,680
people I think that that much like how Firefox had its adoption spread I think it's going

992
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,920
to be young people that make it interesting like mom and dad screwed up the computer let

993
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:58,440
me replace the OS with something that works just like these two at the browser be like

994
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,280
oh mom and dad you're not using Firefox this is what your problem is let me fix that for

995
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,400
you right yeah yeah you know what you might be right about that Matt I would say too when

996
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:14,400
I think about this you know looking at these these kids that are really smart I think that

997
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,680
really there's two things that we have to realize is that younger Linux users will find

998
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,680
resources that we have out there for the adults like these shows like these shows like when

999
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,520
we make these you know we don't really have a specific age group in mind but we're definitely

1000
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,280
not trying to target a younger demographic but yet they still obviously we have an audience

1001
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,480
that represent that they you know they represent a percentage of the audience that's this noticeable

1002
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,700
and they are finding the same resources that we create for adults and I don't think we

1003
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:46,000
have to get in this mindset that we have to do something very special for the kids I think

1004
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,080
smart savvy kids that are told it is okay self-education is an old is an okay thing

1005
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:57,280
if we can you know because a lot of kids I felt when I was in school I felt the internet

1006
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:03,120
was new right and it was untrusted and there was pushback from my teachers when I would

1007
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,520
self research and self educate like I can't rely on that you don't know if you're teaching

1008
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,680
yourself the right thing you're not smart enough to figure it out on your own you need

1009
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,880
our guidance is really what they were saying and I now looking back on that I resent that

1010
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:20,080
because self-education is a fantastic tool and the internet empowers people to teach

1011
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,880
themselves things on their own in their own room don't you think I think that's I think

1012
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,800
you really nailed on something there even bigger than just the experiences that you

1013
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,000
had I think that the problem is is it was a change it represented the changing of a

1014
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,520
guard to where it was no longer teachers who were the teachers essentially and they no

1015
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,720
longer were the power player or had all the knowledge that there's this new new thing

1016
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:46,960
of an angle thing that kids were quite frankly more adept to than the adults were I was at

1017
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,280
that time when this was happening I was pretty much out of my own and out of school and whatnot

1018
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:55,160
but I witnessed us happening a lot just in society that there seemed to be a real shift

1019
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,640
and so I think that that's probably a lot of what you were experiencing yeah and I think

1020
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,400
maybe that could still be there could be a little bit of that still in play today because

1021
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,800
some of those same teachers are still in and they really are aren't they yeah so I think

1022
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,040
you know if we tell these if we tell these teenagers and kids that hey you know dude

1023
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,600
and do that it's fine go out there and learn on your own you go teach yourself you don't

1024
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:19,960
have to have somebody's blessing to become educated on a topic I think the Linux community's

1025
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:26,440
pride blinds them from seeing the real threat I think maybe we also still see Microsoft

1026
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:32,400
as the threat but I think the reality is the real competition is Apple I think it's I think

1027
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,360
from all they have they have compelling hardware that people a lot of people like not everybody

1028
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,120
the fact that they can sell so many computers that ethernet ports blows my mind but it's

1029
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:48,600
a thing apparently and they they offer sort of at least the idea of a turnkey computing

1030
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:56,640
solution and I think that is I want to I want to sort of keep that in mind as we talk about

1031
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:02,880
the overall Linux community's abrasiveness sometimes when it comes to issues that they're

1032
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,360
passionate about and Matt you touched on this in an article you wrote for DataMation saying

1033
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:12,440
is Ubuntu animosity misplaced kind of from a high level like what's the concept here

1034
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:16,640
basically I'm looking at it from this perspective I always take the Ubuntu perspective for two

1035
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,640
reasons one it's what my editor would prefer and secondly it still covers most of the Linux

1036
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,240
universe just by default anyway so it's really a mood issue in that regard but the point

1037
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,520
is is that a lot of people come into Linux and people I introduced to Linux they go to

1038
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,520
the forums they go to these different places or especially on the social media sites and

1039
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,080
they see a lot of real negative behavior I mean it's really unfortunate the kind of stuff

1040
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,680
you would expect to see in a Windows form you know you like to think you got away from

1041
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,400
I got away from that but in the Linux space it can be really prevalent and for a lot of

1042
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:48,200
people to turn off but also going deeper than that I feel like that so what got these people

1043
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:53,120
to that mindset in the first place and a lot of it does come down to unity other aspects

1044
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:57,360
of Ubuntu as well I mean just really nailed down the list you know you said Ubuntu simply

1045
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:01,280
needed to give unity more time and development for releasing it because of that it got you

1046
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,280
know a big backlash from the community simply put you said I believe some folks within the

1047
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,240
Linux community felt like Ubuntu was isolating itself with this move to unity I think that's

1048
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:14,640
probably a fair point that caused some hurt feelings and then or you know maybe hurt feelings

1049
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,560
is the right way to put it but it caused people to take sides and then you said you know down

1050
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:25,120
the road you had the mirror versus Whalen tobacco which we're very familiar with and

1051
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,240
we said when it was first announced mirror was to be Ubuntu's choice for Xorg's replacement

1052
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,400
once again the Linux community sounded off at the time I took a stance on the matter

1053
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,920
that explaining I took a stance on the matter explaining that if mirror didn't get at least

1054
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:41,600
one additional distro to use to use it as a display option I would wear a monkey suit

1055
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,960
for the masses unless well it's 12 months later I've lost the bet I'm prepared to pay

1056
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:51,400
the price initially agreed upon now for the bitter pill you don't want to hear the casual

1057
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:56,040
computer user couldn't care less about the issue so long as the applications work as

1058
01:01:56,040 --> 01:02:01,160
expected I suspect we'll be seeing shrugs of indifference throughout the Ubuntu masses

1059
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:05,840
no I see this as a battle of wills between developers and their opposing views and I

1060
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,640
think you nailed it there yep and I think if you look at will Wheaton what he just said

1061
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:13,680
he couldn't give two craps about way doesn't versus mirror and he also defeats the thing

1062
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:18,320
that it's only new users that don't care he is not a new user by any oh great point so

1063
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:23,580
I think this is something we've got to appreciate is people you know as their lives get busy

1064
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:28,320
just because just because they might not be they might be technical people but they might

1065
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,240
just decide that they don't have time for drama or they don't have time to follow this

1066
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:36,000
kind of stuff and that can be a whole off-putting thing in itself and you say the back and forth

1067
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,280
was perhaps even more heated than we'd seen than the unity versus gnome challenges in

1068
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:45,000
the past like the mirror versus Whelan thing was like every time they've had something

1069
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,560
that event has been more hotly contentious than the one before it that's true and it

1070
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,200
seems like like the animosity is building on itself and building on itself and it's

1071
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,440
like this snowball that just keeps rolling and then of course we get into the whole upstart

1072
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,680
versus system D discussion which you know canonical and about two more directly involved

1073
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,620
in but you say unlike the unity versus mere debate upstart got the attention of a fresh

1074
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:12,120
new crop of Linux users as it directly affected how a Linux distro starts and stops events

1075
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:16,840
and services so even if you're not a system admin or a developer this affected anyone

1076
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:21,160
who uses Linux on a day-to-day basis definitely and I noticed a lot a lot of people that normally

1077
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,320
wouldn't care one way or the other about desktop environments or whatnot because they just

1078
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,720
use something else this affected them more so because it was under the hood it's gonna

1079
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:33,080
change how they do things and you said of course the CLA at its core the CLA is perceived

1080
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:37,400
as a barrier among many developers within the Linux community you mentioned Linus Torvalds

1081
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:43,420
expressed his displeasure with all CLAs in all forms and you know that's been a real

1082
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:48,620
concern for some developers and you mentioned in your closing thoughts that the Linux community

1083
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:53,840
is passionate involved and sometimes overtly loud when it comes to the direction the platform

1084
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:58,680
is headed in that you say while users such as myself try to be tried hard to remain neutral

1085
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:02,440
and not act as though using our computers as a religious experience the community at

1086
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:07,240
large continues to make their voices heard no matter the cost now what do you think that

1087
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:14,840
cost is I think a lot of times the cost is that we create unnecessary you know contention

1088
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:19,260
between each other I think a lot of times that we become so focused on stupid stuff

1089
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:24,160
that we really lose focus of what's going on in other areas for example like let's look

1090
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,920
at the Chromebooks and how Chrome's doing its thing and that you know these things are

1091
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:31,120
selling really well and whatnot rather than focusing on outdoing Apple outdoing Google

1092
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:36,720
outdoing other stuff I feel like we focus on our internal squabbles so much that it

1093
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:41,620
really not only doesn't solve anything it just makes us dig deeper into our own personal

1094
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:47,320
camps well yeah but we ignore bigger bigger issues I think I'm not sure if you're thinking

1095
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:51,640
about it right because I mean there's a lot of things that are huge deals you know like

1096
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:56,680
what side of the window is the close button on oh my god I know oh and the last and how

1097
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,720
I used to know I'm guilty of this I used to I used to bitch constantly about the lack

1098
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,640
of a minimize button and no I made a big stink about it just and why went on and on and on

1099
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,120
and on about it no one cares I mean you know it was my problem not yours right so it's

1100
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:13,080
like why would anyone care but I'm I'm guilty of this as well I'm just as bad as the other

1101
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:18,520
guy Riley what are your thoughts on the unity well there's a thank you interesting about

1102
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:24,800
unity too there's a large user base who would actually use unity on other distros if they

1103
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,800
could sure oh yeah people would use unity on ours if they could but since they can't

1104
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:36,080
they just hate on it I actually think unity is maybe the the ultimate example of stuff

1105
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:42,500
that we argue about that actual users don't care about because here's the thing even if

1106
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:47,240
unity was quote unquote the most terrible desktop in the history ever it doesn't matter

1107
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:52,360
if you if you are even slightly linux technically inclined you know how to use a different desktop

1108
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:56,220
and if you're a new user to linux you really probably have no problem with unity because

1109
01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:00,000
truth be told it's not that bad especially if you don't come in with preconceptions

1110
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,680
and go ahead honestly isn't that bad it's a very pretty desktop especially if we used

1111
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:14,760
it 1204 board right actually halfway stable I don't know what you think I think it's something

1112
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,640
that we're general users just don't even know they should be caring about and and if you

1113
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:24,760
think somehow like maybe user choice plays into all of this yes absolutely here's the

1114
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:30,960
thing we keep talking about over and over again linux is about freedom and choice and

1115
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,120
it's something that I wrote actually on the subreddit when it comes to desktop environment

1116
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:41,980
use whatever you like the best and works best for you don't let anyone talk you into something

1117
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:47,360
else just because they like it more or have some other agenda good advice yeah yeah rotten

1118
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:52,360
corpse you switched your mom over to a unity desktop I did how to go been using it for

1119
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:59,080
about two years now I guess yeah she has no problem with it the the thing is I I was using

1120
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:03,120
it at this time because I was testing it out and I wanted to kind of like have her opinion

1121
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:09,520
on it and because she's a completely she doesn't really care at all all of the de's and stuff

1122
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:14,080
like that's irrelevant to her it doesn't matter so when I look at unity I find the little

1123
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:18,000
flaws and stuff that I don't like and a few things that I do like the dash I don't like

1124
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,960
it almost at all but I asked her what she think about the dash she's like what's that

1125
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:27,920
and I explained it she's like yeah I don't care that's cool yeah exactly well see I've

1126
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:33,520
had so I had my dad running an older version of Ubuntu with unity and he really liked it

1127
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:39,640
he was coming from it was either XP or 7 it was before Windows 8 and he was switching

1128
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:45,040
over and he ran Ubuntu for a little while and what he ran into is kind of what you touch

1129
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:49,160
on here Matt is you say in sort of closing out your article you say my concern is that

1130
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:53,440
newer users have just come over to the Linux side of the fence will be scared away by some

1131
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,720
enthusiasts and their misplaced animosity towards Ubuntu will this color how the majority

1132
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:04,080
of newcomers see the Linux community it did for my dad yeah and I've seen evidence of

1133
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:07,200
it I don't just you know I actually have people that I talked about this stuff before I write

1134
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,640
this stuff yeah yeah he saw it he saw you know when he was so he had two problems I

1135
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:16,440
think first problem was is he wasn't really clear on where he was supposed to go to look

1136
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:22,440
up problems and like so he wanted to he moved at one point and they didn't have internet

1137
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:26,640
access they didn't have like cable or DSL where he'd moved to and so he wanted to tether

1138
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:33,080
to his phone and like trying to look up and he was at work and trying to do like the googling

1139
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:38,600
at work and then bring that home he got so many different results and so many different

1140
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:43,040
mixed messages on that whole thing that it and I don't I wouldn't blame it all on this

1141
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,680
but I think it definitely in when it came time to buy a new rig altogether he just kind

1142
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:52,960
of decided to go get a Mac yeah oh yeah because it's an all-inclusive experience and much

1143
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:57,040
as I'm not in any way a Mac person believe me I really don't like them at the end of

1144
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:01,000
the day they don't sell a computer they sell an a collective experience yeah they really

1145
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,640
do and you know they have the whole the whole genius angle to it too so he was able to ask

1146
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:12,280
the guys some questions and I so this article you wrote really resonated with me here because

1147
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:17,400
not only did I see that through my dad's experience but when we were taking the arch challenge

1148
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:22,280
there was equal parts really good advice that I got from you know some awesome people on

1149
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:27,040
our subreddit and things like that and there was equal parts really like hostile bad advice

1150
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:31,240
that I got everything from trying to scare me away from using arch and telling me how

1151
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:35,780
hard it is to use and how I I really have to keep the system maintained and it turns

1152
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:38,880
out to be like the easiest Linux box I've ever had to maintain right that it would be

1153
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:43,040
unstable because you're using bleeding that was another one yep yep and you know don't

1154
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:48,720
use this tool use that tool and it's I and I suspect this happened for you too but it

1155
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:53,520
gave me pause for a little bit where I thought I don't think I want to deal with this right

1156
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,840
I know I don't like this this is I don't need this you know and it's even more nuanced than

1157
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:03,120
it is an arch because an arch there's multiple ways to install a piece of software we're

1158
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,560
like an Ubuntu like pretty much the end of day every guide is gonna tell you sudo apt

1159
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:11,240
get install right add this PPA like there's consistencies so you can get a lot of different

1160
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:13,800
you get a lot of information but they all kind of tell you to use the same tools and

1161
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,960
do the same things not the same thing in arch now thankfully that wiki is very authoritative

1162
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,220
and has a lot of good info but when you're just switching I felt like I had a lot of

1163
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:26,920
mixed messages and I can so I'm I think that experience might be what a lot of new people

1164
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:31,400
get when like you know they're reading a common thread and there's just tons of Ubuntu hate

1165
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,680
in that common thread I would agree and I and what you said about the wiki the problem

1166
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:40,480
with the wiki is that it's it's it's too good and and and what I mean by that is that the

1167
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:44,440
information in the wiki blows other distributions out of the water as far as accuracy but the

1168
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:49,680
problem is locating and knowing what to search for to find it that's the rub for a lot of

1169
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:52,240
people because you don't always know like when I was trying to figure out the whole

1170
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:56,320
battery life for you know the battery life situation for my netbook I wasn't necessarily

1171
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,160
finding exactly what I was looking for to about the third or fourth search and then

1172
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:03,800
I clicked yeah and the information was fantastic but it was finding it so I think if they can

1173
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:07,920
hone that a little bit the information is gold there's no problem there some people

1174
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,120
actually suggest people to look at the arch wiki to find the information which is a good

1175
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:16,760
idea but they'll also suggest to people who are not using arch which is right very awkward

1176
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,540
now yeah yeah that's true right you were gonna you were gonna say it kind of depends on the

1177
01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:26,000
existence of users of Linux to make regular users experiences a little more easier right

1178
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,160
I was basically just gonna say that when when people talk about moving people to Linux they

1179
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:35,520
always think about you know hair telling the advocate of why Linux is good and why they

1180
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:41,080
should use it but they don't necessarily make that transition easy like for example with

1181
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:47,200
my mom or my roommate or my neighbor I've moved over I set up their computer to I find

1182
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:51,200
out what they want I put I put the Linux thing that I think fits best for them the distro

1183
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:54,480
I mean and then I put on the different apps that they want like for one of them wanted

1184
01:11:54,480 --> 01:12:00,440
Wow so I had to put wine in so then I wow connection and is if you give them Linux set

1185
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:05,120
up where they can have it just how they would just the stuff they want to use and the things

1186
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:09,200
that they would be used to like the way they get Windows but it's already installed if

1187
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:14,040
you do that for them the transition to Linux is almost negligible in as far as like whether

1188
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:18,400
it's hard or not mm-hmm that's true that's true I used to support Linux at a small bookstore

1189
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:24,620
in town north to me and I actually the service calls were well they went from a ton of them

1190
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:29,780
to none yeah as long as I maintain the machine yeah I definitely noticed during I used to

1191
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:35,040
joke you know when when my clients would ask me like so what should we do here for this

1192
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:41,400
desktop and I would tell them you know I I would say I thankfully a lot of my clients

1193
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:46,840
use Windows I'm very thankful for that because it gives me ten times the amount of business

1194
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:52,160
that I would have if they ran Linux and that's not just me like gas and that's like literally

1195
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:55,680
from my experience like I can put Linux in and once things are set up and stabilized

1196
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:59,760
like rotten corpse is saying is I would go in there and I would configure everything

1197
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,880
for them right and I would even set it up so it would take snapshots of their configuration

1198
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:09,400
settings and all that kind of stuff and back those up and we could restore them very simply

1199
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:14,600
and webman was a great tool to help some some of their local tech gal set up users and stuff

1200
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:21,360
like that and that works so well that I would literally lose money on those clients exactly

1201
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:25,560
yeah that was that when I switched to Linux full-time is about the time I got out of repair

1202
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:29,400
so now it was going to say our problem here is that we've been conditioned by Microsoft

1203
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,120
what's going on there Rick well here let me just go ahead and set the way back machine

1204
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:39,000
to like 1995 when Windows 95 first came out people were up in arms that their programs

1205
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,080
were not right there in front of them like they had on the program manager of Windows

1206
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:50,520
3.1 now fast forward 19 years later now everybody's looking for that start menu if they see that

1207
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:57,240
start menu they are up in arms it's just like okay now Microsoft has conditioned us to operate

1208
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:02,720
this way and see that's the thing people are assuming that a desktop environment such as

1209
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:13,160
humanity is unintuitive just because they're not used to it I suppose yeah that man has

1210
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:17,840
earned a ding all right well here you go there you go you get a ding Dave you were gonna

1211
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:23,920
say that maybe we just need to cater to each specific user that's your go man that's your

1212
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,840
go right there no that's all right well that's I think what he's gonna essentially saying

1213
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:31,680
I don't know he has a little bit of lag by the way okay yeah it's complicated no what

1214
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:36,400
I was simply going to say is every user has their own sensibility of how a desktop should

1215
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:42,040
and should not be I mean you have people who use Windows 8 perfectly with and without touch

1216
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:47,000
and you have people who see the Macintosh interface and see if that's the perfect desktop

1217
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,440
they can't use anything else regardless of of you know whatever it is so every user has

1218
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:57,880
their own sensibility of what a desktop should be and what their workflow should be so what

1219
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:04,800
while we're arguing about what the perfect one is well thinking of a hypothetical magical

1220
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,520
user that that doesn't really exist that's me that's exactly that that's what I'm kind

1221
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:16,880
of driving at is that intuitiveness is subjective yeah true yeah and I think so this goes goes

1222
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:22,160
going back to Apple is the big threat here I think that the thing about Mac OS that you

1223
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:26,520
got to wrap your head around is that it's it's not a great desktop in a lot of ways

1224
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:32,840
like when I use it for you know I have several machines here in the studio and you know to

1225
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:37,440
me it feels very old it feels like it feels like I can you know I remember the Macs from

1226
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:42,560
the 80s and I still see a lot of influence there and I don't think it's I don't think

1227
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,920
it's that amazing of a desktop I think it's what Matt's saying is that with Apple it's

1228
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:54,040
this hardware good enough software better than of the alternative which is Windows and

1229
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:59,240
that support package and I think when you're somebody like Wil Wheaton and that price isn't

1230
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:03,720
a factor because that's the bit I'd say the number one argument once you take out all

1231
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:07,880
the freedom and the open arguments which if you're not even if you don't even know to

1232
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:12,320
be concerned about that that's not even part of the equation right if you take away that

1233
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:16,280
and you take away the cost barrier because for a huge segment of people that's not going

1234
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:21,800
to be an issue I think I think Apple is a fierce competitor to Linux I think it's I

1235
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,840
think it's much more of a threat on the desktop than than Windows is well it is especially

1236
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,120
for someone coming from Linux because they can drop down to a command line and do anything

1237
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,600
they need to do I mean that's the other thing like look at Megali Dekaza you know one of

1238
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,040
the original gnome developers who faint who eventually just threw his arms up in the air

1239
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:39,960
and said you know what I'm gonna go get a MacBook but you could sort of that equivalent

1240
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:45,520
on Linux easily if you go with something like Ubuntu and system 76 I mean they have excellent

1241
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:51,800
customer support magnificent hardware on top of generally they ship on what like LTS is

1242
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:57,560
I think this is an important piece is this is this is why I'm a system 76 fan is because

1243
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:04,240
they they are also creating that entire end-to-end experience but the problem is is we don't

1244
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:08,840
have enough people doing that and it's right you know it's like whereas Apple has this

1245
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:15,200
massively established presence and brand and I just you know we do our part just to spread

1246
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:19,020
the word about system 76 because I think it's a really important I think that whole entire

1247
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:26,000
product package is super important and I think one way we can achieve that today is in larger

1248
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,960
installations like at schools and at businesses where you have a person that comes in and

1249
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:36,520
rolls out a system for a whole bunch of people that seems so ripe for the Linux desktop picking

1250
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:41,280
to me it's ridiculous it's just this maybe a few software applications but that just

1251
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:47,840
seems so ripe whereas you know that home user who's you know you know a 30 something 30

1252
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:52,160
something hipster that just wants to go down to the mall and buy a metal MacBook I don't

1253
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:56,080
know if we're gonna be able to get that person but I think schools and businesses and anytime

1254
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:01,440
where you can take the experience and you can build it around the need I think Linux

1255
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:07,080
is such a slam dunk for that well that's sort of already happening now we see Chromebooks

1256
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:14,040
and Chrome OS which is technically Linux based in educational areas all the time now it's

1257
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:19,400
becoming increasingly popular that just makes me sad so I think the formula to the you know

1258
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,360
to making this work is the fact that it takes a multinational company make this happen right

1259
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:30,860
what I would say is that what it goes it boils down to the same thing that Matt has said

1260
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:37,480
a bunch of times and that is marketing yeah that's Mac Mac stuff the software isn't is

1261
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:41,760
okay and it's built on stuff that was already there to it was already good in the first

1262
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:47,560
place so it's like if you took LXDE put a dock on it it's very close to way Mac works

1263
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:53,520
or like gnome 3 or you know if you spend a couple hours configuring KDE right yeah you

1264
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:59,280
can have a I really believe you can have a more modern experience desktop that has better

1265
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:05,040
efficiencies it's in some ways can especially I think for gnome 3 can be more user-friendly

1266
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:10,000
I agree I just this is such a this is such a problem that I just kind of want to and

1267
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,800
I guess I want to bring this back to how the community can make a difference here and we're

1268
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:19,440
not going to convince everybody to you know lay down arms and embrace each other in a

1269
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:25,920
kumbaya but I have an idea what what if the GNU project because they always want Linux

1270
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:34,160
to be called GNU slash Linux they put up money for marketing to make it GNU slash Linux I

1271
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:39,680
don't know I think it's close I think it's close get a GNU start with GNU slash Linux

1272
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:43,680
well here here's an actual actionable formula of how this could actually be done first of

1273
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:47,680
all you get yourself Kickstarter product project you know or however you want to fund it some

1274
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:52,160
sort of a collective funding process that gets a bunch of advertising dollars together

1275
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:57,920
then everybody in key metro cities goes to the Google AdWords program that allows you

1276
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,320
to advertise in your local cable channels take a fiver voiceover of one of those really

1277
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,560
good movie voices slap together some great video capture from OpenShot or whatever just

1278
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,200
really show off what the desktop can do make it sound like a movie intro launch those in

1279
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:16,800
each one of those metro areas on television stop this internet crap on TV where regular

1280
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:21,280
people actually get their media and watch what happens I think you might be surprised

1281
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:25,600
isn't this part of the problem though is there's no there's no you know Linux Inc. there's

1282
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:33,280
no there's no company that that needs to you know capitalize on this opportunity that could

1283
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:37,280
capitalize there's individual companies that are all kind of scattered about and I think

1284
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,520
that's one of the reasons you know Ubuntu has such name recognition is because there's

1285
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,200
a company behind that and Red Hat has such name recognition and brand recognition but

1286
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:49,680
there's no one company who's you know got the money and the and the presence to do that

1287
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:56,640
and so maybe let me let me shift the conversation here is this why everybody is so hard over

1288
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:02,560
mobile because it's it's the grand reset of this technical century that we get to start

1289
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:08,480
all over again and you know everybody is everybody is a fresh and new and the possibilities are

1290
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:15,200
endless is that why everybody's so hot on mobile hmm well maybe it's because they have

1291
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:21,840
right now essentially two platforms that they have to look at only and they're so massively

1292
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:28,320
widespread now that it's since it's easy for people who are not computer users even just

1293
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,600
regular people who just want a tablet so they can watch something like Netflix Netflix or

1294
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:36,160
something it can bring that so many more people to look at your stuff so people are just kind

1295
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:42,080
of like jumping on the bandwagon of any kind of mobile device of all yeah well I mean and

1296
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:46,880
it's a lot easier to get mobile devices in the hands of individuals around the world and the

1297
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:51,680
fact that you know there's billions of individuals around the world that still don't have a mobile

1298
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:56,240
device that's a huge user base that a company could target well like Dave is saying in the

1299
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:59,600
chat room everybody loves a computer in their pocket but wimpy what kind of tipping point

1300
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:05,040
do you think we're at what you say we're at a tipping point right now well 20 years ago apple

1301
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:13,360
was um in in uh excuse the queer localism it was in the shitter and um you know they've really

1302
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:19,280
turned their fortunes around and and the two companies that are really driving um popularization

1303
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:24,480
of cutting edge technology at the moment are apple and google so I think the tipping point that we're

1304
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:33,120
at right now is that Microsoft is is on a downward trend um they're hanging on to traditional markets

1305
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:39,760
and really not succeeding in that and I I think the tipping point we're at is with with apple

1306
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:46,720
and ios and mac os 10 and then google with obviously android and then chrome os and I

1307
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:52,800
think it will be a battle that's fought out between mac os and linux in the guise of chrome os

1308
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:58,800
well I think the big problem with windows is it's sort of like become a tainted name

1309
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,800
like I know people who won't buy windows phones because they think they'll get viruses it's a

1310
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,240
black mark yeah I agree I think the windows name is now a black mark on a product and I think the

1311
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:13,440
general consumer thinks it's something old and it's not hip it's not cool anymore I think that's

1312
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:18,640
what's holding back a lot of these windows mobile devices and desktops um and I think that's well I

1313
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:23,760
feel sorry for Microsoft because they can't win they try and be hit and then everyone says oh we

1314
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,720
don't have to use metro and then they try and be like old school and everyone has a go at them

1315
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:33,360
for not being different it is kind of bad for them they're trying to be hip again

1316
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,160
they're just trying to do it through a bunch of you know people dancing around

1317
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:42,720
holding tablets and that just doesn't work clicking them together exactly because you

1318
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:46,640
know I use a computer I'm always running around my office smacking the monitors together to try

1319
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:51,600
and get it to accomplish tasks I mean really yeah I that's an interesting concept so and I you know

1320
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:58,240
uh the whole idea um is it gonna be is it gonna be macbooks versus chromebooks in the future

1321
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:02,000
and you'll have everybody who wants to save a buck running chromebooks but they'll be

1322
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:07,840
inextricably forever linked at the hip to google and you'll have everybody that wants to drop some

1323
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:14,160
cash we're talking you know large percentages here buying macbooks and uh is linux gonna be

1324
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:19,520
in is the predominance of linux gonna be this bastardized closed down souped up for their

1325
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:31,040
commercial cloud services um client side wait you said commercial software would that honestly be

1326
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:36,800
so bad I mean this is open source people can do people can do whatever with it that they choose

1327
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:42,880
and people can implement it the way they want and if linux adoption requires that companies

1328
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:48,800
like google and whoever change it the way they need to or you know the stabilization of linux

1329
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:55,040
will that be so bad because isn't that sort of the original idea it's negative in the freedom

1330
01:24:55,680 --> 01:25:01,360
dimension I don't I don't know uh it's not it's not what I hope for and I think also you know

1331
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:05,680
we can't really have this conversation without keeping in mind that linux will dominate on the

1332
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:09,040
server side too and that's going to be all different kinds of operating systems but it

1333
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:16,160
does make you wonder like what the future holds for these desktop focused distros and uh if

1334
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:22,160
eventually they're not just going to be kind of you know just the ones that survive will be the

1335
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:27,920
ones that are maintained by community enthusiasts yeah I've noticed uh myself like especially and

1336
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:33,600
I don't know if it's just the point of my life I'm at but I see my parents and my grandparents and

1337
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,240
you know all these people around me going and saying I don't know what to do anymore you know

1338
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:42,160
they've always they've always had you know go with windows if you want business or you know

1339
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:47,760
go with mac if you want media and now they don't know where to go and you know it's kind of this

1340
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:52,320
weird point where people that you know once thought they knew what they had to do don't

1341
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:57,680
know anything anymore yeah kind of sad it's a weird we're in a weird transition and I think

1342
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:02,240
what we're trying to wrap our brains around on this show is what do we need to change to get

1343
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:06,960
linux in position to sort of be there to catch a certain amount of people who are dropping away

1344
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:14,720
from windows and uh are there things just as a community we could do oh is it safe to emerge

1345
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:19,600
well I think it is safe so that wraps up this week's look back uh we'll have a full crew next

1346
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:25,120
week and we'll be back with a regular show I definitely need to take a shower and rikai he's
