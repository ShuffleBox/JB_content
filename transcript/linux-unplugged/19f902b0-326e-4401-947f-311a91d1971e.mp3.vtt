WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.620
What colors your hair?

00:01.620 --> 00:03.620
Still brown still brown

00:03.620 --> 00:09.520
I think I'm gonna do it at Linux fest if I remember problem is that the the hair dye already got taken from me

00:09.520 --> 00:11.660
So I already had forgotten until you said something taken from you

00:12.160 --> 00:16.720
Every time I'd sit down at the studio. I'd set my arms down and all of a sudden like everything was turning red

00:16.720 --> 00:20.000
It was ridiculous. I was like oh, this is no good

00:20.000 --> 00:24.820
I think if Chris does it he needs to he's to go all the way and do the orchid

00:26.160 --> 00:28.160
I don't know if that's gonna happen

00:28.160 --> 00:34.560
Maybe I also feel like if he's gonna do it. He needs to bleach his hair. Oh, yeah, Chris. Are you gonna bleach your hair?

00:35.880 --> 00:38.560
No, he says oh junk then yeah

00:39.760 --> 00:41.760
It's gonna look no good really why?

00:42.200 --> 00:46.400
Cuz you do orchard what you should do orchard. Why why don't you bleach my hair?

00:46.400 --> 00:51.700
That's that sounds like a bad time. Well, how are you gonna put a lighter color on a darker color? Is it lighter?

00:52.600 --> 00:54.600
Both of them are well think so

00:54.600 --> 01:00.120
Pretty dark hair bro. It's it's not gonna show up at all. Really, you know what they say about guys with dark hair, right?

01:00.120 --> 01:05.000
I feel like we could have not said this on air and then that could have been my out now you guys are just totally

01:05.000 --> 01:09.040
No, no. Yeah, the mistake you made is we want you to do this. Oh, yeah

01:10.080 --> 01:15.360
Well, damn it. See what I think you should do is I think you should make your hair red and your beard organ

01:17.880 --> 01:20.120
It's not actually a terrible idea oh

01:20.120 --> 01:22.480
Oh

01:22.480 --> 01:29.760
My gosh, dude, this is Linux unplugged episode 195 for May 2nd 2017

01:41.680 --> 01:46.800
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's ripped out all of the proprietary software

01:46.800 --> 01:53.020
Replaced it with good old Linux. My name is Chris get it out of it. Wait. No, my name is well, yeah

01:53.020 --> 01:55.540
We're gonna keep it here now. Yeah, we got all the proprietary software adder

01:55.540 --> 01:58.540
We'll tell you a little bit about that later, but that's not what we're gathered here to talk about today

01:58.540 --> 02:03.120
Oh, no, we do have a great show though. Oh, that was really totally

02:03.860 --> 02:06.740
That was great though. I really enjoyed that some new projects

02:06.740 --> 02:11.260
Some of the pretty excited about because Wes has gotten his hands on them directly and he's like, hey, I've been trying this

02:11.260 --> 02:13.940
We got to talk about it. I always love those segments on the show

02:13.940 --> 02:18.480
Then a big big big change has come to all of those encumbered

02:18.980 --> 02:26.020
audio files on your hard drive will tell you about that and then Windows 10 s has been officially announced and it's got

02:26.500 --> 02:29.500
Chromebooks and desktop Linux in the education market

02:30.260 --> 02:36.320
Squarely in its crosshairs. Oh, oh boom squarely. Let's just right in there Wes watch out for that and then

02:37.180 --> 02:38.860
coming up in

02:38.860 --> 02:44.260
Just a few short days the final episode of the Linux action show Linux fest Northwest

02:44.620 --> 02:48.580
live Linux unplugged perhaps I'm okay. We'll tell you all about all of that and

02:49.620 --> 02:56.160
Some of the efforts we've been going into here to get all of the Linux get all of the Linux and maybe if we have time

02:57.020 --> 02:59.660
We'd like to have a very honest and frank conversation

03:00.460 --> 03:07.040
About the state of Linux battery life some tools some tips some tricks from us and the virtual lug

03:07.040 --> 03:10.120
To manage battery life to get better battery life

03:10.120 --> 03:12.400
Wes has a has a story you could perhaps share with the class

03:12.680 --> 03:15.800
from a co-worker who recently tried Ubuntu 1704 and

03:16.080 --> 03:20.960
we'll just kind of hopefully walk away with some tips to have better battery life on our laptops because it seems like it's on a

03:20.960 --> 03:27.540
Downward trend these days under Linux when Mac and Windows perhaps are at their best the new Microsoft surface laptop announced today

03:27.540 --> 03:33.840
They claim 14 hours of battery life. So we'll see maybe can we get Linux close? Can we get close?

03:33.840 --> 03:38.600
That's the question. I certainly hope so. Yes. Yes. So before we can do any of it

03:38.600 --> 03:43.080
We've got to bring in our virtual lug a time-appropriate greetings bumble room. Hello. Hello

03:46.720 --> 03:48.240
So guys

03:48.240 --> 03:52.880
There is there is a couple of open source projects that I thought we'd start with this week that are just really cool to check

03:52.880 --> 03:55.800
out and really cool to see come, you know come to fruition and

03:55.960 --> 04:01.720
The first one is one that the Mac users have had for a while that I I really thought would be great on Linux

04:01.720 --> 04:04.480
And now it's here. It's called open snitch

04:05.360 --> 04:09.400
It's a open source port of the little snitch application

04:09.600 --> 04:12.880
That's pretty famous on Mac and it's an application firewall

04:12.920 --> 04:19.000
But what it does is it gives you graphical alerts about the applications on your system that are trying to take

04:19.120 --> 04:24.440
They're trying to make an outbound connection and then the first time it happens you can take immediate action

04:24.440 --> 04:27.200
You can whitelist that application. You can block it allow deny

04:27.200 --> 04:32.720
It's a cool. It's a cool way to see what's talking to what and sometimes you're surprised. What's talking to what?

04:32.720 --> 04:35.160
Yeah, exactly ever seen it. Yeah, you know

04:35.160 --> 04:40.480
I've used it on I've seen people use it institutions that used it on on Mac OS and it

04:40.760 --> 04:42.320
seemed like it's that like

04:42.320 --> 04:47.780
Last mile kind of thing that we often associate with the Mac or some of the programs for it where it's like, yeah

04:47.780 --> 04:52.080
All right, I could do all of that with IP tables or you know other means command-line applications

04:52.080 --> 04:57.320
But but probably you don't I mean if you do great and there's a lot of cool guides out there to do that

04:57.320 --> 05:03.080
But for like, you know the people who just installed Linux or their casual users or they just want like, um, you know

05:03.080 --> 05:06.160
They don't do it all the time. They want a cleaner simpler interface. They can remember

05:06.160 --> 05:07.680
I think this looks like it could be nice

05:07.680 --> 05:08.040
Yeah

05:08.040 --> 05:12.500
the other thing that's cool about it that I've used a couple of times when I had client max is I was installing a new

05:12.500 --> 05:16.660
Piece of software and I wanted to figure out what I had to punch open in the corporate firewall or I just want to know

05:16.960 --> 05:20.080
What's going on in the system you fire up in this case now open snitch

05:20.080 --> 05:24.360
You run it for a couple of hours and you just get a list of everything that's trying to talk to everything you discover

05:24.440 --> 05:30.480
That this application that runs in the background actually pings this HTTP server every hour, which you didn't know before

05:30.480 --> 05:33.340
Yeah, totally. That's good. It is nice a little bit of visibility

05:33.440 --> 05:33.920
Yeah

05:33.920 --> 05:38.080
Now there's been some people say oh, you know running this kind of stuff through Python probably isn't a great idea

05:38.080 --> 05:39.800
And it probably doesn't have the best performance

05:39.800 --> 05:43.920
So you wouldn't necessarily want to put it on a server that's handling tens of thousands of requests

05:43.920 --> 05:47.880
But if it's on your you know, like your laptop or your your parents computer or something

05:47.880 --> 05:50.840
It might be might be worth a try they do caution that it's alpha quality software

05:50.840 --> 05:52.520
We don't know how good it is right now

05:52.520 --> 05:54.840
I've only played with it just a little bit but something to watch

05:55.120 --> 05:55.620
Yeah

05:55.620 --> 05:58.920
It's officially being entered into our cool open source projects that we're gonna keep track of

05:59.040 --> 06:03.240
Category that we like to have on this show and now in the category of cool projects

06:03.240 --> 06:05.520
And I think you've had a chance to play with this maybe a little bit too

06:06.600 --> 06:07.720
Deb

06:07.720 --> 06:16.040
Simple get it. It's like dead simple, but it's dead Deb simple and I don't really understand because it's like a repository server for app

06:16.040 --> 06:21.800
So it's like your own local repository server. But does it does it not have packages? Is it is that right?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.800
like it says on here that there's

06:24.360 --> 06:28.760
Something about does not require packages or something. I read this on what the hell is this West? What is it?

06:28.760 --> 06:32.080
What kind is a little confusingly described? So I was in position where I just had some

06:32.720 --> 06:37.080
Programs that I needed to modify then build I was packaging up as Deb files

06:37.080 --> 06:40.300
I really I mean I could just download them and install them but it would be nice to have a little repo

06:40.360 --> 06:44.400
And ideally I'd like this to be minimal effort. It was just for some internal processes, right?

06:44.400 --> 06:47.760
Nothing customer facing and it was a little more work to get set up

06:47.760 --> 06:52.040
I mean like, you know an app a Debbie an arc repo. It's not that complicated

06:52.040 --> 06:57.120
It's mostly just an HTTP server around some special files with metadata that you index the packages and that and that sort of thing

06:57.120 --> 07:01.920
Yeah, so there's like some some app programs out there that'll build that for you access it, but it was a kind of manual

07:01.920 --> 07:03.920
I found a Docker container that was like, all right

07:03.920 --> 07:07.620
Well, you run it this way you SCP the thing and I was just gonna say like there must be a Docker

07:07.620 --> 07:09.920
So they're totally are and that that would have been okay

07:09.920 --> 07:13.920
But that was like really if you were making like you had your dot changes file and you were doing it like you're building like

07:13.920 --> 07:17.680
A source package, you know, and I was really just I just wanted that one artifact

07:17.680 --> 07:22.680
And so this is a little go implementation that provides a HTTP API

07:22.680 --> 07:26.120
So it just makes it super simple if I have a new package, you know

07:26.120 --> 07:30.000
It comes out of my build server Jenkins or something. You just post it over

07:30.880 --> 07:33.640
HTTP post that'll add it to the archive and then BAM

07:34.240 --> 07:38.240
That packages is up there supports multiple versions for packages multiple architectures

07:38.760 --> 07:43.160
And it has it has API key so you can kind of control things as well

07:43.160 --> 07:46.320
So be like well this user can up only this user can update new packages

07:46.320 --> 07:48.560
But other people can get them or more granular than that

07:48.560 --> 07:55.680
I realized the limitation that I was talking about earlier was that it doesn't have the ability to mirror existing repos, right?

07:55.680 --> 08:01.640
So this isn't like a full apt proxy type setup, which I've used before but really isn't what I needed

08:01.640 --> 08:03.640
I just wanted my own little simple local mirror for

08:06.280 --> 08:08.680
And and because it's go it was like go get

08:08.680 --> 08:13.000
Get hub dot blah blah blah and then it was running so it was super easy. Yeah

08:13.040 --> 08:19.200
So there's a project that I'm watching and maybe if anybody in the virtual log there has a suggestion for something else

08:19.200 --> 08:24.280
Feel free to jump in but I'm watching this project called hardened Linux

08:24.840 --> 08:30.920
And it's at hardened Linux gnu. I'm sorry old habit hardened Linux github.io and

08:31.640 --> 08:36.760
They say they're a group of free software enthusiasts anarchists and cybersecurity researchers

08:36.760 --> 08:42.360
Long live anarchy the site reads and long live old school spelt with O's. I think they're being a little tongue-in-cheek there

08:43.120 --> 08:49.920
They it's a small step in security hardening and a giant leap in free and open source software. It's a it's an interesting idea

08:49.920 --> 08:55.000
It's a core infrastructure. So you're familiar with like obviously all the different projects out there to secure your system

08:55.000 --> 08:56.280
So what if you brought them all in one spot?

08:56.280 --> 08:59.160
What if you just brought them all together and tried to make a distro based around that?

08:59.160 --> 09:01.160
It's kind of think what they're going for here

09:01.160 --> 09:09.040
They're all they're also big on on that on a bunch of different open source security projects like PACS and GR security and whatnot

09:09.040 --> 09:13.480
So interesting new initiative. I've always been fascinated with the whole

09:14.120 --> 09:19.080
Like really super ultra secure Linux stuff. I've played in the past lockdown

09:19.400 --> 09:22.680
I've played in the past like there's a I came up as I called Bastille

09:22.680 --> 09:23.120
I can't remember

09:23.120 --> 09:27.040
There's a piece of software you spell to load on Linux that would go through and try to harden it to meet all these

09:27.040 --> 09:31.360
Requirements and so they I think they're either basing around like a Debian a Debian base

09:31.360 --> 09:35.240
I don't know just something I came across this week that I'll be digging into more might have a review down the line

09:35.320 --> 09:39.800
Once I get a chance to check it out and and try it out or or learn more about it

09:39.800 --> 09:44.040
At least I was just just sort of digging around when I came across it this week and thought let's share this with class

09:44.040 --> 09:48.480
It started though in 2014. So it's not like it's brand new. Yeah, the group the group's been together for a while

09:48.480 --> 09:48.720
I don't know

09:48.720 --> 09:51.640
I don't know if they're shipping out code or I don't really what they've got at this point

09:51.640 --> 09:55.640
but something to dig into hardened Linux and one of the things too that I

09:55.640 --> 10:01.560
I used to struggle with was I used to have to be able to show regulators that I was taking steps to

10:01.920 --> 10:06.880
Right meet certain requirements and and so if there's certain things that like you if you can come across

10:07.200 --> 10:08.520
This is a question to the audience

10:08.520 --> 10:13.280
If you know one where you can come across like checklist for how to make how do you make a boon to Linux?

10:13.520 --> 10:19.960
Meet these regulatory requirements. How do you make sent us meet these regulatory requirements or are there distros out there?

10:19.960 --> 10:24.440
Or is something like hardened Linux maybe a project to get us there where it's like you you can start with a Debian base

10:24.440 --> 10:26.440
And we've applied all of these

10:26.560 --> 10:28.400
Security packages are all of these standards

10:28.400 --> 10:31.000
I don't really know quite what's out there these days because I haven't looked for a while

10:31.000 --> 10:34.680
But I've had a few questions come into the show. So I thought I'll open up to the audience

10:34.680 --> 10:38.640
So I this is one thing that I've come across to my research, but I'm curious if anybody else

10:39.600 --> 10:42.920
Has anything I think it's I don't know. I don't know

10:42.920 --> 10:45.520
I don't know if this is even really a project that has much legs anymore

10:45.520 --> 10:50.960
I'm not quite sure but it's there's got to be something out there to meet this particular requirement because I've gotten notes from people

10:50.960 --> 10:55.160
They say well we can't really use Linux because there's no way to prove that we're following this particular standard or

10:55.480 --> 10:59.080
For for you know, whatever the reason is whatever the industry is it changes. Yeah, exactly

10:59.680 --> 11:03.200
Would you so let me ask you this say you were going to play a server?

11:04.000 --> 11:09.580
For a company is there have you ever you ever have you ever worked in a company where they where they say when we deploy

11:09.580 --> 11:12.840
a server you must always configure these things and set these settings and

11:13.080 --> 11:16.940
Turn off these services and install these packages and turn off

11:16.940 --> 11:21.880
The root login on this service like do you do you have you ever worked in a company where there's like a checklist of yes

11:21.880 --> 11:25.020
Oh, yeah, okay, and that's just an internal process that they've developed

11:25.580 --> 11:31.580
Yeah, in a lot of cases that that has been the case and then like these days I see a lot of it done with

11:31.660 --> 11:36.660
Configuration management systems or others like you can run you can have roles or recipes that what defines

11:37.940 --> 11:40.220
What what needs to be changed? Like how do you know?

11:40.780 --> 11:46.420
What to secure how do you know like what services should be configured what way like other than just personal experience and like

11:46.420 --> 11:50.860
You know just learning over the years like how do you know you're actually doing it, right?

11:50.860 --> 11:53.820
you see that's where like we have an issue like hardened Linux or something like

11:53.900 --> 11:58.740
That has like a group of people that are experts in the area that can go through and really come up with a common standard

11:58.740 --> 12:00.740
Of how you secure a system how you make it auditable

12:01.740 --> 12:03.820
That that's something that's a little easier to get more

12:03.820 --> 12:07.740
I think larger buy off like otherwise it seems like to me companies come up with their own

12:08.100 --> 12:15.180
Well, we're gonna configure these things to meet our standards and it's sort of their own internal tribal knowledge that defines what all those things

12:15.180 --> 12:17.460
Should be yeah, I mean, I think there's like, you know

12:17.460 --> 12:21.300
There's some best practice guides and there's some guidance from like the actual requirement

12:22.020 --> 12:24.820
Documentations or like, you know when you get compliance tested or that sort of thing

12:24.820 --> 12:26.340
Yeah, that's usually where some of that will come from

12:26.340 --> 12:30.220
Yeah, right, but if you're not an industry that has compliance testing, but you still want to secure your systems

12:30.260 --> 12:32.500
Yeah, in that case then something like this I think would be

12:32.980 --> 12:34.020
Even if you don't use it

12:34.020 --> 12:39.220
It might be a very handy reference like you might also go look at some of those like cookbooks or other things that see what?

12:39.220 --> 12:43.980
Settings they what changes they're going to make. Yeah, yeah, but you're right that it's not always and then I think there's

12:43.980 --> 12:47.060
Even goes above and beyond where a lot of times like, you know

12:47.060 --> 12:51.860
the the compliance things will be concerned about a fact, you know, like goals and end goals and

12:52.060 --> 12:58.300
Real world things and then that doesn't always necessarily a one-to-one mapping back into how you should configure consistent or which way you should

12:58.300 --> 13:00.300
Configure. Yeah. Yeah, that's the tricky

13:00.620 --> 13:02.620
Monkey come you had something you wanted to add

13:03.180 --> 13:03.780
Well, yeah

13:03.780 --> 13:09.840
I mean every time you do a an audit inside of a banking company that does any kind of financial transactions or has any

13:09.980 --> 13:12.080
any international transactions with banks

13:12.080 --> 13:18.400
They always do those audits where they bring an audit a company in to audit your entire network, and they want you to explain

13:19.280 --> 13:22.600
How you're securing these things exactly. That's what I was trying to say

13:22.600 --> 13:25.000
Yeah, and and they don't you know

13:25.000 --> 13:31.160
It all comes down to having good auditing and good practices inside because even if you're I mean we were running puppet

13:31.160 --> 13:33.040
but then somebody goes and installs a bunch of

13:33.040 --> 13:38.320
applications on a Linux box because they want to be able to debug something and they leave them running and so the scan goes out and

13:38.320 --> 13:43.720
You find all these open ports on a server for something. You didn't even know was running on it. And I mean those are the

13:43.720 --> 13:47.520
I think it all comes down to you know, controlling access to servers

13:47.520 --> 13:52.040
and I if that's what they're doing with a hardened install, I just don't see that working because

13:52.680 --> 13:55.760
Most people don't want to use a custom install for for anything

13:55.760 --> 13:59.040
It's got to be something that uses like Santos or Debian or Ubuntu

13:59.040 --> 14:04.120
It can't be like its own custom role distro because you need a lot of industry industry support

14:04.120 --> 14:07.880
You need folks that can walk in off the street that you've hired that have some built-in knowledge

14:07.880 --> 14:13.600
and you need something that in some industries the auditors can recognize like one of the things that happened to us is a

14:13.600 --> 14:19.080
Couple of times we got pushed away from Linux just simply because it was Gentoo and they didn't know what Gentoo was

14:19.080 --> 14:23.480
They knew what red hat was. This is years ago years ago. And yes, I had Gentoo in production

14:23.480 --> 14:29.820
Yes, I understand but I had a Gentoo system in production. I had many of them and they actually dinged us for it as having

14:30.480 --> 14:34.940
Like this they didn't call it fragmentation at the time, but they dinged us for fragment a fragmented

14:34.940 --> 14:38.140
Network because we had we had Windows boxes

14:38.140 --> 14:40.740
We had SUSE Enterprise boxes, which they understood what that was

14:40.860 --> 14:45.100
We had NetWare and we had Gentoo and it was a lot of systems because we were in the middle of the transition

14:45.300 --> 14:47.300
from NetWare and Windows and

14:47.740 --> 14:50.420
And and so they they come in they're like well

14:50.580 --> 14:56.500
These Gentoo things are some weird thing that somebody sit down some one of your rogue IT people has just installed across your system

14:56.500 --> 15:00.560
and they should be replaced with Windows 2000 using Active Directory and because

15:00.900 --> 15:04.180
That was actually a finding that the auditors recommended

15:04.180 --> 15:05.340
the

15:05.340 --> 15:08.580
The way that what happens is it by the next time the auditors come around you don't have it

15:08.580 --> 15:09.340
That's a big deal

15:09.340 --> 15:13.540
and then if the second time they come around you don't have it you lose your FDIC insurance and then the bank goes out of

15:13.540 --> 15:18.380
Business and so we ended up deploying Active Directory simply as a response to that. Wow

15:19.140 --> 15:24.580
So it's yeah, it was it's really been codified in my memory that sometimes you really got to get that stuff dialed in totally

15:25.020 --> 15:27.020
Well, you know, there's another way to learn more

15:27.540 --> 15:32.420
Linux Academy you go to Linux Academy comm slash unplug. Do you support the show look at idea?

15:32.420 --> 15:37.180
I know right learn more it could be like this little command line tools

15:37.180 --> 15:41.740
You need to learn more or it's the big stuff, you know, like the big stuff like the container stuff. We're talking about

15:42.500 --> 15:47.700
AWS Azure all of that stuff you can learn more at Linux Academy go to Linux Academy comm slash

15:47.700 --> 15:52.420
Unplugged and you sign up you support the show and you can get a seven-day free trial. I like this graphic

15:52.420 --> 15:53.500
They have look at this Wes

15:53.500 --> 15:56.260
Doesn't that really tell you the state of Linux in the world today?

15:56.260 --> 15:59.020
You got Linux at the core and then off at the different branches

15:59.020 --> 16:04.300
You've got AWS Azure OpenStack big data containers DevOps the whole category of DevOps

16:04.300 --> 16:07.620
And it really is at the center of it all Linux and open-source technology

16:07.900 --> 16:15.020
Totally and Linux Academy has the entire platter covered you want to go in and get an education buffet Linux Academy Linux Academy comm

16:15.020 --> 16:20.820
Slash unplugged you sign up you support the show you get to learn more community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members

16:21.180 --> 16:23.420
Instructors that actually know the material that can help you

16:23.420 --> 16:28.140
They have systems in place for team training if you want to get your whole team trained up and you can do it all

16:28.140 --> 16:32.620
For seven days absolutely free just go to Linux Academy comm slash

16:33.420 --> 16:36.240
Unplugged I like the flashcards because they're focused by the community

16:36.240 --> 16:38.420
I like that they spin up servers when you need them

16:38.420 --> 16:44.300
And you can use SSH to log in the courseware and the servers all match. It's so great. It's so great. Um

16:44.820 --> 16:48.300
Our buddy Michael Dominic. Yeah, just started taking some Linux Academy courses

16:48.300 --> 16:54.220
Yeah, it is it's it is so great for continuing education for challenging yourself for staying up to date on stuff

16:54.220 --> 17:01.340
It's just and it's just so easy right like it's it's modern. It's kept up-to-date by Linux experts people experts in all the fields

17:01.340 --> 17:05.700
That they support and so you just know that you're getting a fresh information that you can count on it makes it super easy

17:05.700 --> 17:10.380
You can you can you can tell the passions there exactly yeah, you can join Linux Academy comm slash

17:10.980 --> 17:16.620
Unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program now mr.

17:16.620 --> 17:20.660
Noah joins us to talk about our next story finally Noah after all these ages

17:20.660 --> 17:27.260
We have a brand new version of grub you ready for this. I'm ready. It's grub 2.02. It's gonna support

17:28.140 --> 17:32.860
Experimental 64-bit extended to support it's gonna support LVM UUIDs

17:33.020 --> 17:39.420
It's gonna have proper handling of LVM in general, which I know you're probably excited about absolutely. Here's the thing I'm excited about

17:40.100 --> 17:41.540
ZFS support

17:41.540 --> 17:48.360
Okay, yeah, and it XFS version 5 support for the version 5 format of exit like talk about checking a couple of my box

17:48.360 --> 17:53.180
Yeah, that is awesome as well as support for LVM raid one so does it support?

17:53.700 --> 17:56.420
defaulting to the LTS kernel so

17:57.540 --> 18:02.020
Okay, so a little revealing here a little behind-the-scenes reveal here

18:02.020 --> 18:06.540
We are we're doing a lot of work here in the studio as we've mentioned and where's that mouse hand me that mouse here

18:06.540 --> 18:08.520
I'll give them there for people watching the video version

18:08.520 --> 18:12.940
I'll give you a little behind-the-scenes shot of what we've been doing here. Yeah, we got a new sky cam with and

18:13.440 --> 18:16.020
so a bunch of new equipment in here and

18:16.020 --> 18:23.620
All Linux based all of it even even this big honking mixer this right here. That's Linux what yeah, this mixer runs

18:23.620 --> 18:25.620
I know

18:29.260 --> 18:32.540
It's really something and in a decade it's taken us, you know

18:32.540 --> 18:37.220
but with the qualities there like everything is like we're it's a no-compromise setup. In fact, it's better than the old setup and

18:37.780 --> 18:43.900
That's great. Yeah, and here's what here's what is is awfully funny about it is all of it comes crashing down

18:43.900 --> 18:48.820
If you accidentally boot the OBS machine with the stock arch kernel and not the LTS kernel

18:53.820 --> 18:55.320
One thing it was like, oh, okay

18:55.320 --> 18:58.140
Well this capture card requires a module and that has to be on the LTS kernel

18:58.140 --> 19:04.900
Oh, well actually and I think actually to begin with we have even one more because we had ZFS and that needed the LTS kernel

19:04.900 --> 19:08.300
So it's like there's all these things that had to have the LTS kernel and then you yeah

19:08.300 --> 19:09.440
We just we didn't even think about it

19:09.440 --> 19:11.580
We just restarted the box and like all of a sudden nothing's working

19:11.580 --> 19:17.500
No, the capture working on the audio stuff's working just set it up. Yeah when we'd restarted it before so we were like

19:17.820 --> 19:22.560
How does that happen? Yeah, it is super funny, right and we sit here. We're scratching our heads

19:22.560 --> 19:26.740
We're like everything was working and we're about to start with Koda radio. It's right. Today is a busy day

19:26.740 --> 19:29.360
We've got Koda radio Linux unplugged and texting up all back-to-back

19:29.360 --> 19:32.180
Yeah, and so there's not a lot of time for things to break and we're like what's going on?

19:32.180 --> 19:34.560
What's going on and we guys sitting over there in the chair he goes

19:34.560 --> 19:40.360
Oh damn it had to take the stream down choose the LTS kernel you removed that option now, right?

19:40.360 --> 19:42.280
Well, we haven't we haven't had time yet

19:42.280 --> 19:47.000
I've been recording show right? That's a time to grub right? It's like maybe there's some new cool features that

19:48.000 --> 19:54.760
Also, you're gonna have some network support in there as well as it really at the boot level and some improved support for core boot, too

19:54.760 --> 19:59.360
Really? Yeah, it's a serious release. So on grub. Like what do you mean by network support? I don't know

19:59.360 --> 20:03.160
I'm really excited about this. I'm really excited about this. I'm really excited about this

20:03.160 --> 20:06.120
What do you mean by network support? I don't know. I'm reading this. I haven't I haven't read past that

20:06.120 --> 20:08.680
I just read that I just read down the line. I hadn't read that far ahead

20:10.000 --> 20:11.920
I was so excited about the LVM and ZFS

20:11.920 --> 20:15.160
You know cool it would be if I could get to a point where I could just be like boot off network

20:15.160 --> 20:19.960
Oh man inside of the grub boot menu. Yeah, that's something to get into right? That is really something to get into

20:19.960 --> 20:24.880
It's however, by the way, if you're ever using arch in production highly recommend the LTS kernel. It's a good way to go

20:24.880 --> 20:26.880
It's good. It's a good combo of

20:26.880 --> 20:33.040
Rolling user LAN software, which is what we needed. Yeah a nice level stability. That's right. That's right

20:33.040 --> 20:36.080
Hey guys, you mind if we do a little gaming update just real quick here on the show

20:36.160 --> 20:39.000
There it is. That's I was gonna say you got to have that. Yeah, I got to have that

20:39.520 --> 20:41.360
this is something that

20:41.360 --> 20:44.760
It's a little bit of a little bit of hoops. You got to jump through to get to this

20:44.760 --> 20:47.080
So I'm gonna warn you right now. You got to buy the Windows version

20:48.160 --> 20:50.920
Yeah, and then you got to sign up for the beta but when you do

20:51.800 --> 20:53.800
Under Linux you will get access

20:53.800 --> 21:00.800
To what looks to me like a very very well done mech game you like mech games, you know

21:00.800 --> 21:04.880
Where you're walking around and like in a huge like mech suit, you know, I'm talking about, you know

21:04.880 --> 21:06.040
I'm talking about guys

21:06.040 --> 21:09.680
this is Dark Horizons mechanized corpse and

21:10.200 --> 21:12.920
Gaming on Linux is got good things to say about it

21:12.920 --> 21:16.160
So it was really good like the way the mech moves it feels really good

21:16.160 --> 21:20.000
Like it really really nailed the feeling of walking around in a giant mech suit now

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
It's it's not yet out for Linux officially, right? The developer is actively developing this software

21:25.000 --> 21:27.740
And he's just kind of on the side started making a Linux version now

21:27.740 --> 21:31.040
This is why I mentioned it because I think this is the time to show some love just say hey

21:31.040 --> 21:33.120
Yeah, there's an intro. There's an audience here that's interested in this

21:33.120 --> 21:37.440
So if you want to check it out, you first have to get the Dark Horizons mechanized corpse under Windows

21:37.440 --> 21:39.440
Or just buy it through the steam web app

21:39.600 --> 21:43.960
Sign up for the beta or enable beta mode and then you can go into your library and pull down a little

21:45.720 --> 21:49.520
So what happens if you just buy it unlike the web store, yeah, that's what you do, okay

21:49.520 --> 21:53.200
That's that would have to buy it under Windows. No, that's what I mean. Yeah, it's just that the only version

21:53.880 --> 21:56.760
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's what I do is I would buy it on the web

21:56.760 --> 21:59.980
I would do on the website for sure and then you don't even have to go close to that Windows

21:59.980 --> 22:05.880
Yeah, exactly Noah and I did try while we're in the valve section Noah and I did try to set up a SteamVR

22:06.040 --> 22:10.440
This week. Oh, really and so it's it's hit and miss

22:10.440 --> 22:17.920
So there's really two there's there's a two pronged approach to get SteamVR working under Linux either arch or the second prong is Ubuntu

22:17.920 --> 22:21.200
And in arch it's because all the stuff you well here

22:21.200 --> 22:24.080
Let me back up a little bit. You need to be at least on kernel 410 and

22:24.720 --> 22:30.120
You need to have as of this recording Nvidia driver version 375

22:30.440 --> 22:34.740
Dot-x and it needs to be the Vulcan beta edition of that driver

22:35.000 --> 22:41.260
This is where it gets tricky because both arch and Ubuntu have Nvidia driver 375 as a package name

22:41.680 --> 22:45.460
But it doesn't have the beta Vulcan stuff and it's in the regular repo

22:45.460 --> 22:48.680
So if you just try to install it, that's what you get. So under Ubuntu

22:48.680 --> 22:52.120
You have to go get the Vulcan driver version PPA

22:52.280 --> 22:57.120
Then you have to go into your PPA priorities and you have to pin it above the main repo one

22:57.440 --> 23:03.520
And fight that fight or under arch you have to you have to play dependency hell where there's all these different conflicting dependencies

23:04.160 --> 23:06.160
And then once you even get all that set up

23:06.560 --> 23:12.360
It's basically like hardly anything works. So it was a little disappointing. It was so it's still a work in progress

23:12.360 --> 23:16.000
So we haven't really had a chance to really try it out fully because it's sort of

23:16.720 --> 23:21.860
Yeah, but we continue now. It's like halfway set up for when you know, there's more interesting stuff to talk about

23:22.060 --> 23:22.560
Yeah

23:22.560 --> 23:23.040
I mean

23:23.040 --> 23:27.920
I'm gonna keep working on it because I would like to actually do like a little report on the show and and say this is

23:27.920 --> 23:29.840
How the state of VR under Linux also?

23:29.840 --> 23:33.800
I like just you know, we just want to get I just want to get wimpy's head in a VR headset and have them

23:33.800 --> 23:39.080
See how cool it is. He's such a VR hater, you know, and he's gonna be out here for the Linux fest Northwest rumor has it

23:39.080 --> 23:45.320
So it'd be the perfect opportunity to put his head in a VR headset and get his opinion and because I feel like maybe he

23:45.320 --> 23:49.600
Hasn't really experienced a good VR right because I was a big see here's why I say this

23:49.600 --> 23:52.960
I was like VR smear. Come on. Wake me up and we have holodecks, please

23:53.360 --> 23:57.640
And then I got the oculus and I was like mind blow. Yeah, I had a moment

23:57.640 --> 24:01.080
I had a moment and then ever since then I was all I was all in I thought it was pretty cool

24:01.120 --> 24:05.640
So maybe we'll get a chance to get it working if anybody out there has any experience, please pass it along

24:05.640 --> 24:11.060
Let us know what you dig go to the content we could do we could I tell you what here all the speed technologies to

24:11.060 --> 24:12.980
The rescue if there's anyone out there that thinks I could set it up

24:12.980 --> 24:16.260
Just get in contact with me and I'll get you remote it into that machine

24:16.260 --> 24:20.220
There you go fresh nice fresh 1604 install and you just set it up for us

24:20.220 --> 24:23.540
I'll be your remote hands like I'll plug this stuff in for you. Yeah, totally, you know, whatever

24:23.540 --> 24:28.620
There's got to be somebody out keep on dreaming dude. Keep under maybe though, right? Maybe maybe. All right

24:28.620 --> 24:32.700
That concludes our gaming section. There we go. Wrap it up. Yeah, I gotta wrap up

24:32.700 --> 24:37.780
So anyways, you can find that met game link up in the show notes. This could be good news for all of you

24:37.780 --> 24:41.700
Who are struggling with our org feeds that are under repair right now the mp3?

24:42.460 --> 24:48.540
Technology the licensing program around certain mp3 related patents and software has been terminated

24:48.980 --> 24:54.020
Mmm, isn't it one of them of like the four this would be I think the remaining and the reason why I say this is

24:54.020 --> 25:00.420
On the front har website like the actual like patent holders of mp3. I have a post on their website

25:00.420 --> 25:02.420
Basically saying have at it

25:02.780 --> 25:03.900
Really? Okay

25:03.900 --> 25:09.180
They say we thank all of our licensees for their great support for making mp3 the de facto audio codec in the world during the past

25:09.180 --> 25:11.980
Two decades the development they go into the development of mp3

25:12.660 --> 25:14.660
But yeah, they say

25:14.900 --> 25:17.820
They say that essentially mp3 is still very popular

25:17.820 --> 25:25.820
However, most state-of-the-art media services such as streaming or TV and radio broadcasting use modern ISO MPEG codecs such as AAC or MPEG

25:25.820 --> 25:30.540
H and that's what we're making our money. Yeah, and they make higher quality at much lower bit rates

25:30.540 --> 25:36.860
And then they link you to the successful history of mp3 like they're done with it. Here's the history if you want to read about it

25:38.420 --> 25:46.700
Yeah, they say the the the Technicolor mp3 licensing program for certain mp3 related patents and software for Technicolor and Fraunhauer IIS has been terminated

25:46.700 --> 25:49.460
Hmm. I was thinking it doesn't mean it's now

25:49.460 --> 25:54.780
I think this means it's free as in speech and it's freezing beer, but it's not like free like as in GPL code, right?

25:54.780 --> 25:57.260
Yeah, I don't think it's yeah, it's definitely probably not GPL code

25:57.260 --> 26:01.640
But I was under the impression that we still had some limitations on mp3 due to some existing patents. I could be wrong

26:01.780 --> 26:03.660
Well, it's definitely not like just free code

26:03.660 --> 26:09.380
But I think it means it's legit to I think it means it's safe now to redistribute it like straight up one. Yeah

26:09.380 --> 26:12.340
Okay, that's a big deal today. I learned monkey calm

26:12.340 --> 26:16.100
You want to do a follow-up on a discussion that Noah and Ryan had a few weeks ago. It looks like go ahead

26:17.500 --> 26:22.140
Yeah, so I just installed the pop theme. Oh, yeah

26:22.140 --> 26:27.220
Yeah, this is 76 GTK theme. What do you think a pop? Oh, it's freaking awesome

26:27.220 --> 26:31.980
I mean, I know they're just starting out with it. But if this is what the next few years it's gonna handle for that. I

26:32.820 --> 26:37.300
Mean it's they're doing it. They're doing it right. They're gonna get their users

26:38.220 --> 26:43.460
Exactly what they need to have to make gnome a wonderful experience in Ubuntu now

26:43.460 --> 26:47.360
What are they now? Did you also replicate the bar at the bottom like the OMG Ubuntu screenshot has?

26:48.260 --> 26:50.260
No, no, I did mine on the side

26:50.260 --> 26:53.700
You can play around with it, but just the theme itself

26:53.700 --> 26:56.380
I mean, it's known so you can do whatever you want with it

26:56.540 --> 27:03.700
But the theme itself is just really clean all the the icons pop everything looks good. And when you bring up Windows it just

27:04.380 --> 27:08.820
They're making they're laying the groundwork so that when their users have it

27:08.820 --> 27:14.300
They can use the system 76 theme and it just everything looks the way it's supposed to there's no hidden

27:14.980 --> 27:20.140
Weirdness and they're gonna back it. That's the greatest thing about it. Yeah. Yeah, it is very bright

27:20.140 --> 27:26.300
And some areas like the like they have the gnome tweak tool up and the like the remove buttons and the orange checkboxes

27:26.300 --> 27:28.500
I feel like they're hitting me in the face a little bit

27:28.620 --> 27:33.620
But I I also I like I like the shade of color they've chosen there. So it's I don't know

27:33.620 --> 27:38.500
There's a theme. I think it's a great theme. Here's my question you start out on that and then you go to a

27:39.340 --> 27:40.740
generic install

27:40.740 --> 27:44.380
You know the nice thing about system 76 in the past has been you know

27:44.380 --> 27:48.440
If I start if I bought a system 76 machine there might be a couple little tweaks like they turned off like, you know

27:48.440 --> 27:51.980
The the auto logging privacy stuff. They'd shut a couple of those things up

27:51.980 --> 27:57.100
But it the the system wasn't didn't look drastically different if I sat down at an Ubuntu machine

27:57.100 --> 27:59.840
I knew I was sitting at an Ubuntu machine and

27:59.940 --> 28:05.000
I feel like depending on how far they take this especially if it starts getting into the point where they start they put in

28:05.000 --> 28:09.140
A dock or something like that, you know, does that does that then change that?

28:09.660 --> 28:15.940
Essentially, I guess what I'm asking is have they just have they just forked the the time when we all just finally got settled on

28:15.940 --> 28:19.820
A given desktop, right? When you say for it, you mean like the user experience in a sense, right? Yeah

28:19.820 --> 28:20.220
Yeah

28:20.220 --> 28:25.260
yeah, but I think we're talking apples and oranges there because conical supported the unity and

28:25.740 --> 28:31.980
I know gnome has its own support structure, but there's not a commercial company behind them saying, you know

28:31.980 --> 28:36.840
Do we this is what we're going to do? Well, I think system 76 does as a vendor

28:36.840 --> 28:42.940
I don't think you just say here's my desktop whatever they do flies and I'll be okay with whatever they choose next year

28:42.940 --> 28:44.940
Yeah, I think yeah

28:44.940 --> 28:49.860
I'm of two minds of this because my first thought is well, where do you draw the line because I've I've

28:51.380 --> 28:51.980
You know

28:51.980 --> 28:56.620
I've had I've had a big revelation recently about gnome extensions that I'd like to share with the class here in a second

28:56.620 --> 28:59.300
But before I so before I before I defend them

28:59.300 --> 29:04.600
I'll raise you my concern and my concern would be is what we end up with is essentially the

29:04.900 --> 29:09.340
Bastardization that's happened to Android where you've got Samsung skin. You've got LG skin

29:09.340 --> 29:12.080
You've got a moto skin and some vendors have a light skin

29:12.080 --> 29:18.860
Some vendors have an entirely different UI with their own applications on top and it's a real shit show and what everybody pines for is

29:18.860 --> 29:20.580
Just a good clean

29:20.580 --> 29:25.620
Regular Android experience and that's why West has a pixel right there, right? That's where that's that's the market spoke

29:25.620 --> 29:28.180
He said we don't want your customizations. We don't want your cut

29:28.180 --> 29:30.180
We know you think you can add value

29:30.180 --> 29:34.220
But the problem is you can't keep up with the pace of rapid development, right now

29:34.220 --> 29:42.060
Gnome is not Android. Gnome is not developed or modified nearly at the rate that Android is and I gnome is a

29:42.740 --> 29:50.660
product and project of limited means and limited resources and so it's within that context that I look at what system 76 is doing

29:50.660 --> 29:52.660
Not at the so not not

29:52.580 --> 29:56.860
Comparing what they've done to like what Android has done or what other desktops like, you know

29:56.860 --> 30:02.260
Cuz you could also say the same thing about we all know there's some Windows OEMs out there that have just crapped up Windows with

30:02.260 --> 30:08.300
Their own start menu Lenovo and their own their own updaters and they just junked up Windows and nobody wants that either

30:08.300 --> 30:09.700
So there's definitely a risk of that

30:09.700 --> 30:15.640
The thing about gnome though is while it's a great desktop and I just recently switched back to it really enjoying it

30:15.740 --> 30:19.340
Stays out of your way very efficient, but it's not enough

30:19.340 --> 30:22.420
It just the thing is you have to have extensions with gnome

30:22.740 --> 30:28.720
Because the team just doesn't have the time or resource to add everything that everybody wants in an entire world full of geeks and adding

30:28.720 --> 30:34.820
To that what everyone wants is different with every person and you know, you look at the last few releases of gnome solid incremental improvement

30:34.820 --> 30:38.980
But no moving of the gas pedal nothing that's freaking people out no big changes

30:38.980 --> 30:45.160
And so there's there's really no massive progress that system 76 gonna fall behind by shipping their own theme

30:45.160 --> 30:48.900
The risk of divergent user experiences is there. Mm-hmm

30:49.460 --> 30:52.140
And that's I think we just have to wait and see how that plays out

30:52.140 --> 30:57.740
But I think because because of what the reality of gnome is there is room for a vendor to improve on it

30:57.740 --> 30:59.180
But they just can't go too far

30:59.180 --> 31:01.580
And so system 76 like has to walk like this

31:01.860 --> 31:06.460
They are not only gonna kind of create the line they have to walk but then they have to walk it like super tight and then

31:06.460 --> 31:09.820
We're all gonna have the advantage of sitting back and go. Well, they did a good job or they didn't yeah

31:09.820 --> 31:14.100
I don't know. I'm I so I share your reservations, but I almost feel like there's no path forward

31:14.100 --> 31:18.180
Yeah, well the path for an alternative path forward might be we say we go to the gnome team

31:18.180 --> 31:21.860
We say here are the things that we think that would really improve this experience. What do you think about it?

31:21.860 --> 31:25.260
And then, you know collectively everyone that's all that's using gnome

31:25.260 --> 31:28.780
Everyone that makes those decisions looks at it says yeah, we agreed that would be a you know

31:28.780 --> 31:33.060
A way forward and then and then now we've improved it not just for system 76 customers

31:33.060 --> 31:36.780
But for everyone that's using no, I feel like it took him forever just to get wadi updated like it was

31:36.780 --> 31:41.580
Yeah, and I'm like, why do you guys care so much about the rounded corners of your menu?

31:41.580 --> 31:44.660
But you don't care that your default theme looks like garbage like how does that work?

31:44.660 --> 31:47.820
Mm-hmm, and I think their stance, you know what I thought I thought about their stance as well

31:47.820 --> 31:50.340
The themes can be changed and that's why we build it this way

31:50.340 --> 31:56.820
And so they're like building the core of what you need with the expectation part of me. I gotta be honest guys. I

31:58.060 --> 32:03.300
Really hope that Ubuntu does not ship stock gnome in some ways because it's not that great. Yeah

32:03.540 --> 32:07.380
It's really not that like there's not needs a spit shine right on a little bit

32:07.380 --> 32:09.500
Yeah, like it needs a couple of things fixed up

32:09.500 --> 32:13.100
But it you know, that wouldn't kill you to set a decent default background

32:13.100 --> 32:15.100
It wouldn't kill you to turn on one or two extensions

32:15.100 --> 32:21.100
You know really you whatever whatever you got done just in about five minutes of goofing around with numb the thing is what you got

32:21.100 --> 32:22.620
To pretty quickly and you said it best

32:22.620 --> 32:26.100
You just said it's pro you go from what looks like a hack on

32:26.700 --> 32:31.340
Linux what everyone thinks of is like a Linux graphical desktop and you turn it into a

32:32.140 --> 32:36.140
Professional broadcast machine just by tweaking a couple of a little like things, right?

32:36.140 --> 32:40.380
Like the dark menus and the dark windows and the in the smaller window borders and stuff like that

32:40.500 --> 32:42.540
It just makes for a much more pleasing desktop

32:42.540 --> 32:49.500
Yeah, I think if they just even I agree like if they check if gnome if gnome adopted a default theme of like arc or even

32:49.500 --> 32:53.340
Numix or something like that, then I feel like we'd have a totally different conversation then I'd be like

32:53.740 --> 32:59.220
Now I feel like system 76 is just trying to differentiate and you know make themselves, you know brand their desktop

32:59.220 --> 33:01.940
Right, but right now as it stands, I feel like they don't really have a choice

33:01.940 --> 33:06.780
I mean they almost have to in some interesting to see what it would take to get them to change things like the default theme

33:07.300 --> 33:09.300
That's not very good. I

33:09.300 --> 33:11.580
Don't know why it took them so long to begin with. Yeah

33:11.580 --> 33:15.100
So we're gonna have a conversation about laptops here in a little bit

33:15.100 --> 33:19.340
In fact, we had a question that came into the show about the setup you did on the Macbook

33:20.060 --> 33:22.980
2013 so I thought we would get to that in a little bit

33:22.980 --> 33:27.700
I also thought maybe we in the context that we could talk about Windows S and

33:28.180 --> 33:33.180
Microsoft's attack on Chromebooks and all of that. So we have a lot to get plus we still have Linux fest stuff

33:33.180 --> 33:37.940
So let's stop and thank digital ocean for a moment digital ocean comm you go over there use the promo code

33:37.940 --> 33:42.820
Do unplugged one word lowercase you apply that to your account after you've created it and then you get a $10 credit

33:42.820 --> 33:47.060
You know, they're so you don't have they introduced high-memory droplets. You can get like over 220 gigs of RAM

33:47.060 --> 33:48.260
They got block storage

33:48.260 --> 33:54.100
You can attach you can attach like just a block device with a bitsy bitsy tight little bit of storage up to 16 terabytes of SSD

33:54.100 --> 33:59.180
Storage now they're introducing it's in you can request early access right now. It's not finished but

33:59.660 --> 34:01.660
high CPU droplets like

34:01.660 --> 34:09.300
Maximum consistently fast lots of core big boy CPUs like there are some big compute jobs going down

34:09.460 --> 34:13.020
DigitalOcean.com now if you're like me you just want to run a next cloud instance

34:13.020 --> 34:13.740
It's great for that too

34:13.740 --> 34:19.300
In fact, you can get started at $5 a month and you get a machine with 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one

34:19.300 --> 34:25.780
CPU a terabyte of transfer and all of the storage is SSDs all of it runs on KVM for the virtualizer Linux for the hyper

34:25.780 --> 34:32.020
Yeah Linux for the host hypervisor. It's got 40 gigabit e connections into the data center right up to the VMs each VM

34:32.020 --> 34:34.860
I mean we're talking can you imagine that I would love to see them

34:34.860 --> 34:37.940
They actually have some pictures on their Instagram feed and it looks super

34:41.300 --> 34:49.260
Whole thing just the whole thing. Yeah, it's it's so nice. I love I love DigitalOcean's interface too because it makes managing all this easy

34:49.260 --> 34:53.220
We all know how to use it. It's straightforward. And then when we're done setting everything up

34:53.220 --> 34:55.860
we just plug it up to the API and just

34:56.220 --> 34:58.740
Push a few buttons tell the bots what to do after that

34:58.740 --> 35:03.620
Just yell at the bots DigitalOcean.com use the promo code DO unplugged check them out

35:03.620 --> 35:07.380
And also when you're there and you've got a machine set up and you want to do a little more with it

35:07.460 --> 35:11.700
Take advantage of their really great documentation. They have I

35:12.460 --> 35:15.360
Have a tutorial on Grey Log for Ubuntu 1604

35:15.360 --> 35:20.020
They just posted seven days ago very very useful and also a tutorial on how to use the Python debugger

35:20.020 --> 35:25.320
hosting multiple websites with nginx and HAProxy using LXD setting up

35:25.980 --> 35:29.380
Yeah, I know setting up Debian setting up CentOS setting up webman

35:29.700 --> 35:35.820
Lots of tutorials lots of open source projects to take advantage of your droplet once you have it going for experts or total beginners

35:35.820 --> 35:41.300
Trust me, you can make it work go to DigitalOcean.com sign up and then apply our promo code DO unplugged

35:41.820 --> 35:44.820
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the unplugged program

35:45.420 --> 35:49.620
So today Microsoft announced Windows 10 s it's not a joke

35:49.620 --> 35:54.780
It is a simplified Windows Store only version of Windows for schools

35:54.780 --> 35:57.620
The s stands for streamlined and performance guys

35:59.260 --> 36:00.540
So jank

36:00.540 --> 36:07.140
But this seems to be actually sort of exactly what valve was worried about why we got steam machines to begin with was this eventual?

36:07.340 --> 36:09.140
Windows Store only

36:09.140 --> 36:11.580
Closed down nature even though the you know

36:11.580 --> 36:15.620
And I thought I thought when the Windows Store failed and that nobody bought stuff there that they wouldn't do this

36:15.620 --> 36:21.380
But even despite the failure, this is what's so incredible about these rich corporations that can just burn cash doesn't matter

36:21.380 --> 36:24.140
It doesn't matter like it. Oh, yeah, our stores been a total failure

36:24.140 --> 36:24.580
Okay

36:24.580 --> 36:25.700
The vision

36:25.700 --> 36:30.780
Keeping the vision and they say that do you get better battery life when you can only run store apps that you don't have weird

36:30.780 --> 36:33.980
Stuff updating in the background. They say it's better security

36:33.980 --> 36:37.820
It's best for schools and they're gonna pair this with some of their hardware partners

36:37.820 --> 36:42.340
They're gonna sell computers running Windows 10 s for 190 bucks

36:42.340 --> 36:48.100
They have to they have to do this right because if they don't do this they are going to get overrun by Google and Chromebooks

36:48.700 --> 36:52.560
Yeah, I'm gonna get over there as a raspberry pies and in Debian

36:52.560 --> 36:56.740
They're gonna get overrun by all of the other all of the other hardware and software

36:57.460 --> 37:02.160
Combinations that exist out there that don't require Microsoft Microsoft's licensing model

37:02.160 --> 37:04.620
And and if they open it up and let people use apps

37:04.620 --> 37:11.940
Then people would be running Windows these Windows s books with OBS and learning how to broadcast and they would be running open office or Google

37:11.940 --> 37:19.180
Docs, so the only way they can prevent that is to force them to buy their applications through their store for their Windows book

37:19.180 --> 37:24.100
That is specifically designed for education. It's really it's kind of a sad thing. Hmm. What do you think Wes?

37:24.100 --> 37:26.620
I mean, it does seem like they kind of they have to do this

37:26.620 --> 37:33.000
I imagine you can you know also sell the the schools on office 365 educational editions or whatever

37:33.000 --> 37:37.580
So it is, you know you you get them in your platform and I do see I mean, it's it's kind of like iOS

37:37.580 --> 37:39.380
I do see something like well, right

37:39.380 --> 37:45.780
There may be some auditing capabilities of Windows Store apps other things. It may be a lower maintenance burden for IT staff

37:45.780 --> 37:47.780
That's possible. I don't know for sure. I wouldn't

37:49.340 --> 37:50.580
Having used Google Apps

37:50.580 --> 37:56.900
You can drill down the management of Chromebooks like you would not believe down to down to what what what?

37:57.120 --> 38:01.820
Icons are available on the Chromebook itself. So can that person go to this given site?

38:01.820 --> 38:04.420
Can they click on this given link? Can they run this given application?

38:04.420 --> 38:10.260
Application, you know down to that. So is there like a potential opportunity for Linux or for yeah

38:10.260 --> 38:15.740
I guess we're like for regular Linux here in that will this make Windows more associated with this limited thing with well

38:15.740 --> 38:20.100
See, here's my worry is it's a it's it's first of all

38:20.100 --> 38:23.540
Probably not gonna be a lot of open source applications in the Windows Store, right?

38:23.540 --> 38:26.780
So probably not gonna be getting GIMP in the in the Windows Store, right?

38:26.780 --> 38:30.140
You're probably not getting Inkscape which would be great tools for schools, right just as an example

38:30.140 --> 38:33.580
So on the low end you've got so much momentum around

38:34.380 --> 38:40.300
Microsoft OEMs active directory Windows management that I could see it doing some serious actual credible damage to even

38:40.380 --> 38:42.780
People that might be putting Ubuntu on library machines

38:43.420 --> 38:46.660
So I'm worried on the low end that it's gonna eat away and then on the high end

38:46.660 --> 38:49.540
They're also doing something else. So it's like a two-pronged approach on the high end

38:49.540 --> 38:54.740
They have the thousand dollar surface laptop now, which is like their new developer machine

38:54.740 --> 39:00.740
They got a big fancy video, but look at the verge and Microsoft has created a real laptop this time

39:01.460 --> 39:07.280
So this is the surface book laptop and one of the things Microsoft's done with this sucker is its cloth on the inside

39:07.340 --> 39:13.020
So they've and they've laser cut out the keys like they've yeah, they've really got they have a pixel sense

39:13.420 --> 39:17.860
Super high resolution 1080p display on the thing. It's light as hell

39:17.860 --> 39:21.060
It doesn't have any ports which seems to be what everybody actually has a couple ports

39:21.060 --> 39:27.860
But you you get my drift. It has like one USB port one mini port dongles. It's got yeah, you gotta have dongles

39:27.860 --> 39:33.380
So what are the chances I can run Linux on that weird cloth bad boy? I don't know honestly probably pretty good

39:33.380 --> 39:38.580
I have an amazing luck running Linux on Microsoft. You try it. You try it. Oh nice. You try it

39:38.580 --> 39:40.860
I feel like I don't want to give Microsoft any money

39:40.860 --> 39:44.500
But I feel like it's gonna be a little bit before it's working but so they got a high-end thing here

39:44.500 --> 39:49.580
They got you know, this is obviously going after your XPS 13. Yeah, you know those kinds of machines your Lenovo's

39:49.580 --> 39:52.540
You're at your galago pros and they're claiming

39:53.460 --> 39:56.860
14.5 hours of battery life if you use Windows S

39:57.620 --> 40:03.940
It'll be great for all those VB developers. Yeah, right and they have integrated a vapor chamber into the aluminum chossy to

40:04.620 --> 40:11.780
Give it better cooling out the rear standard for $9.99 is a core i5 version with 4 gigabytes of RAM

40:12.060 --> 40:16.280
128 gigabyte SSD and it's gonna start shipping June 15th. Nice

40:16.280 --> 40:21.920
4 gigs of RAM. Yeah, that's just that's unbelievably low. Yeah, but 999

40:21.920 --> 40:25.040
So, you know when you get the $2,500 version will be everything you need

40:25.280 --> 40:31.360
So they got you got this two-pronged approach. You've got you've got them going after Chromebooks and students

40:31.360 --> 40:36.760
Oh also, I should have mentioned this Windows S Windows 10 s free for students and teachers

40:37.400 --> 40:40.320
So that coming, you know all that coming have at it though

40:40.320 --> 40:44.960
And I'll tell you what here's I made this prediction on ask no one you're actually seeing the start of it come up

40:44.960 --> 40:48.400
You are gonna see Microsoft pivot to software as a service

40:48.400 --> 40:51.320
And so they they'll give you the student and teacher version for free

40:51.320 --> 40:54.040
And then once you go to the pro version, they're not gonna sell it to you

40:54.040 --> 40:56.040
They'll just it'll be $39 a year

40:56.800 --> 41:02.480
That's coming. It's not we've already seen it start with the high Cal license seats stuff is all subscription based now

41:02.680 --> 41:04.680
so I mean it's

41:04.800 --> 41:09.920
And that's a bad boat for everyone to be in because that's how I feel because here's the thing what you're gonna wind up with dumping

41:09.920 --> 41:15.680
On the market to you're going to wind up with a bunch of people that get sucked in on a free thing before they can

41:15.680 --> 41:19.960
Actually ever do anything interesting with it. They're going to have to pay a ransom fee. Yeah

41:20.680 --> 41:23.680
So and Microsoft that's how Microsoft plans to stay in business

41:24.560 --> 41:27.600
Because they have to sell something and nobody's buying Windows

41:28.240 --> 41:30.240
so

41:30.440 --> 41:36.080
Mumble room anyone there have any thoughts on how free Windows is going to affect student and teacher adoption of Linux

41:36.080 --> 41:39.760
What do you think monkey? I don't think it's gonna affect it. I

41:40.600 --> 41:46.680
Just got I'm working with a school right now and the conversation is how do we get away from Windows and all of their?

41:47.720 --> 41:51.320
requirements just for doing business with them, it's not an

41:51.880 --> 41:53.560
with can you elaborate

41:53.560 --> 41:54.920
well with

41:54.920 --> 42:01.200
With Google, it's a web interface you log in and you basically manage everything remotely. You don't have any

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
infrastructure requirements

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
Secretary at the front desk could set up a student where?

42:08.000 --> 42:15.960
With Microsoft, it's not like that. It's just that they're they're they're barrier for entry is a lot higher, especially for small private schools and

42:17.200 --> 42:22.560
That's something that you see a lot with these guys this is Microsoft comes in and they offer a lot of free stuff

42:23.080 --> 42:26.600
But it's not free because you still got to buy the hardware. You still got to buy the infrastructure

42:27.440 --> 42:30.560
And they're getting away they have a bunch of Macs that were donated to them

42:30.560 --> 42:36.880
but they're having to get away from Mac because they put Apple TVs in every office and they and they

42:37.200 --> 42:41.200
Plugged them in so that the teachers could present their take their iPads

42:41.200 --> 42:48.360
Oh really put presentations up and it completely destroyed their entire network because of all the Apple talk and the broadcasts and it

42:49.400 --> 42:56.000
Yeah, the DNS just killed everything Larry's and but see that's how that's how these guys do it is they

42:56.000 --> 43:01.440
They're not delivering a complete solution. Yeah, they're delivering just one component of it

43:01.440 --> 43:06.700
And that's why I don't think that Microsoft is gonna take off as in the schools unless you have a vendor who's

43:07.520 --> 43:12.600
Developing the whole solution and walking in there with a Microsoft solution, right? Right. Okay, that's fair

43:12.960 --> 43:15.160
So I see come more people. So I wanted to go to arm one

43:15.160 --> 43:18.120
He says not much Linux and UK schools to begin with go ahead arm

43:18.120 --> 43:25.840
A lot of the schools in the UK are buying into the Microsoft stuff because of all the office 365

43:25.840 --> 43:31.920
Oh, yeah, so that you can link all schools together and you can easily talk between teachers. What about Chromebooks?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.280
Not much

43:34.280 --> 43:39.520
Well, I've worked at a few schools and never seen one in a school

43:39.520 --> 43:42.760
I mean the last school I worked at they were starting to go all-in on

43:42.760 --> 43:49.780
like just getting dumb iPod the very basic iPods just to use as a it's like just an interface for

43:49.920 --> 43:57.360
Smart boards and things that finding that I was cheaper than doing it any other ways, but you very rarely see like classes of

43:58.420 --> 44:05.880
laptops in UK school sometimes but the school I were for if you know if I want to use laptops

44:05.880 --> 44:10.760
We might have three sets of laptops for the entire school and then you've got you've got a book about whenever you want

44:10.760 --> 44:17.800
Yeah, so you that's interesting interesting dynamic from the u.s. Because in the u.s. Chromebooks are like highly prevalent

44:17.800 --> 44:21.720
Yeah, we just have hearts of them. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, I mean you go into

44:22.720 --> 44:26.900
You know you go into some of like the PC world see it and this may be maybe for

44:27.480 --> 44:31.960
Old Chromebooks tucked into a back corner. Most people don't even know what they are how they work

44:32.760 --> 44:34.280
and

44:34.280 --> 44:38.240
As far as schools guy, I was having a conversation with our IT guy and saying, you know

44:38.240 --> 44:42.760
He was saying that their head of IT with was looking at maybe Google classroom and stuff

44:42.760 --> 44:47.480
But no one's really got the time to look into what it is and how it works and then Microsoft is saying, you know

44:47.480 --> 44:51.360
I'll take more of our free stuff and we've made this new Microsoft team speak

44:52.000 --> 44:57.480
Bulls, you know just utter crap for that replaces this thing, but we're not going to turn that old service off

44:57.480 --> 45:03.680
So now you've got you've got SharePoint and you've got 365 and you've got this and you've got that and you've got and none of the

45:03.680 --> 45:05.680
Teachers know what the hell is

45:05.680 --> 45:09.160
All right. Hmm. That is very good insight. Thank you very much

45:09.160 --> 45:12.120
I that's good to hear is just even for another perspective Swift

45:12.160 --> 45:15.520
You kind of are on my train of thinking where I'm like, well crap

45:15.520 --> 45:20.800
Is this another market opportunity that Linux could be about to miss out on if Microsoft can come along all of a sudden and offer?

45:20.800 --> 45:26.080
Windows machines for 180 bucks 190 bucks all of a sudden the entire rules have changed. What do you think?

45:26.080 --> 45:28.080
Do you think this is yet another maybe?

45:28.160 --> 45:30.160
Opportunity slipping between our fingers

45:30.160 --> 45:34.080
Yes, I really do. I mean Linux has been around for a long time

45:34.080 --> 45:39.240
I mean we get to the point like with with Vista missed opportunity

45:39.780 --> 45:47.160
We got eight missed opportunity. We got ten again missed opportunity. When are we gonna have our stuff together?

45:47.760 --> 45:51.640
So that we can really compete with the other stuff that's out here

45:51.640 --> 45:56.280
I'm tired of these people with their shiny little Macs and they're pretty little little computers

45:56.280 --> 46:02.960
Just use Linux for crying out loud and do what you got to do and stop paying all this money for the stupid crap that

46:02.960 --> 46:06.800
We just don't have to do like our turn. It's our turn

46:07.680 --> 46:11.240
Aren't you supposed to be giving up already? Give up on this market. Damn it

46:12.400 --> 46:14.360
I'm with you man. I'm with you

46:14.360 --> 46:17.600
I my only my only thought on it is you know

46:17.600 --> 46:23.920
There is such a there can be in some of the schools not always but there can be a tinkering element and that tinkering

46:23.920 --> 46:31.780
element often leads to Linux and open source and right it's it there's something about open source and maybe even canoe and and the

46:31.780 --> 46:33.780
GPL in particular that

46:33.940 --> 46:38.940
Feels very in line with sort of the core principles of continuing education or fundamental education

46:38.940 --> 46:43.640
Like there's something about it that feels like a really organic fit and there's something about

46:44.280 --> 46:51.220
Licensing and proprietary software that to me has the feeling of walling off knowledge and holding not holding knowledge

46:51.220 --> 46:55.800
Whereas open source is about learning and sharing and improving which is what education should be about too

46:56.280 --> 47:00.100
So it doesn't limit exploration creativity. You can do whatever you want with it

47:00.100 --> 47:02.680
So there is like to me it feels like a really fundamental

47:03.040 --> 47:06.360
Fit that is almost long-term too hard to deny

47:06.440 --> 47:13.440
But there's also practical commercial budgetary things that are very real in schools, too. So you just I

47:14.160 --> 47:15.520
Don't know. We'll see where it goes

47:15.520 --> 47:15.800
You know

47:15.800 --> 47:19.280
I remember when Windows 10 was about to be released and the tech press was so

47:19.280 --> 47:21.280
Stinking positive and if you guys recall

47:22.000 --> 47:25.900
Windows 10 was given away to everybody for free initially. Well in their defense

47:26.840 --> 47:29.280
Windows 10 was a drastic improvement over Windows 8

47:37.280 --> 47:42.080
They had a reason to because after Windows 8 it was like met geez the DOS would be an improvement, you know

47:43.720 --> 47:47.880
Yeah, yeah, I guess well both of them you can only have the one app open at the time so

47:47.880 --> 47:52.560
All right. Do you think we should make a video to sell it to like pitch it to the people?

47:53.800 --> 47:57.760
That'd be good. That'd be a good Noah. That'd be a good Noah video. Like oh, yeah

47:57.760 --> 48:03.360
Yes, what AltaSpeed should get into is the education market. Oh, yeah, maybe although that's pretty budget constrained

48:03.360 --> 48:05.880
But I imagine hospitality is too. Yeah. Yes

48:06.960 --> 48:10.840
So, I don't know. I mean once you get in there like you can you know

48:10.840 --> 48:16.280
if you get a right school you can I some of the fun some funnest work I did in some ways was at schools just

48:16.280 --> 48:22.000
Because there isn't the that quite quite the like we have this site has to go live on Monday morning

48:22.000 --> 48:24.880
So we can start taking orders kind of pressure. Yeah, that's not there

48:24.880 --> 48:26.760
But it's still if we need to do a good job

48:26.760 --> 48:30.480
But it's not going to be in the end of anyone's careers if this goes south either

48:30.760 --> 48:34.760
That's a nice environment even if it's budget constrained because you still get a little creative

48:35.320 --> 48:37.320
Linux is a good fix for a lot of that stuff

48:37.320 --> 48:40.600
But there's still scale that you get to play with and there's you know

48:40.600 --> 48:43.320
Really busy hours and there's privacy that you have to take into consideration

48:43.320 --> 48:47.000
So it's still it's still a very challenging and interesting environment to work in

48:47.760 --> 48:50.840
So yeah, I'd be at the end of day you're helping kids like that's that's great

48:50.840 --> 48:53.860
Yeah, so as long as you just give me a little off the top for that recommendation

48:53.860 --> 48:55.860
I think you should totally get into it now. Yeah

49:00.240 --> 49:05.560
Send all support to crazy Jupiter broadcasting.com. Does that work like that? Does it work? Oh, okay three-year SLA

49:07.320 --> 49:09.320
Three years have you ever emailed that man?

49:09.320 --> 49:11.320
You

49:11.440 --> 49:15.520
Know what that is not it is I have actually gotten to emails like they're three years old

49:15.520 --> 49:19.120
I've been like hey, thanks for email, and I'm sorry. I just got to this it came up on a search

49:19.120 --> 49:21.120
And yeah, I've done that before

49:21.480 --> 49:25.520
Boy, when I once I went once I left for Texas the inbox just kind of went yeah

49:25.520 --> 49:29.740
Well, you didn't have many before that so I can understand how they drastically changed your outlook

49:29.800 --> 49:33.520
You know what I got to do is I got to get a really good email program on my phone

49:33.520 --> 49:36.160
Have you seen some of these like there's Google inbox. That's not bad

49:36.160 --> 49:37.480
Yeah

49:37.480 --> 49:41.920
You do I'm a really big fan. I just started using a new one. It's called because you were

49:42.480 --> 49:45.360
Before you were using one that I'd like canine canine. Yeah, yeah now

49:45.360 --> 49:49.520
I'm on a program called blue male, and we have a blue man by far my favorite thing about it

49:49.520 --> 49:54.320
is I can swipe left and mark it as later or done and

49:55.120 --> 50:00.760
That allows me to to archive that message and then come back like that's a task. Yeah, I like blue male

50:00.760 --> 50:05.200
Yeah, yeah, the task angle is is a nice man. Yeah, what I'm using a lot on inbox

50:05.200 --> 50:08.640
I'm Felix. I feel like I'm already using gmail, so it's not like I'm right. It's just a layer on top

50:08.640 --> 50:08.960
Yeah

50:08.960 --> 50:14.080
I like the remind me about this at this day at this time feature because it's like okay

50:14.080 --> 50:18.600
I I have certain days that I deal with this kind of work and so I'm gonna set it for a minder on that day

50:18.600 --> 50:22.440
An inbox you can use with other mail service for us cuz I'm on a fast new new new no

50:22.440 --> 50:25.040
That's why I really like about blue males. Yeah, I use it with fast mail

50:25.040 --> 50:28.560
You don't have to have all the privacy stealing compromises of Gmail right right you know

50:29.440 --> 50:32.200
You know speaking of mobile phones ting. That's what you do

50:32.200 --> 50:36.440
You go there get a deal go to linux.ting.com get $25 off one of these phones

50:36.440 --> 50:39.320
You want to get a new mail app on your phone first got to start with a phone?

50:40.080 --> 50:41.040
That's math guys

50:41.040 --> 50:45.320
That's that is phone math linux.ting.com is where you go if you have a compatible phone

50:45.320 --> 50:48.000
And you just might they got CDMA and GSM

50:48.000 --> 50:50.920
Then you'll get $25 in service credits you bring it over to their

50:51.200 --> 50:55.320
BYOD page you look at all the dirty details, and they'll tell you if it's gonna work on ting or

50:55.960 --> 50:57.960
Or take a shortcut

50:58.000 --> 51:00.560
Call up ting and talk to a real human being and just ask them

51:00.560 --> 51:05.200
They'd be more than happy to work with you the fact that they have CDMA or GSM is big for me, too

51:05.200 --> 51:09.720
If you go on road trips like I do or you travel every now and then huge or heck

51:09.720 --> 51:13.520
You're just gonna move and you don't know what the cell service is gonna be like right go with ting

51:13.520 --> 51:17.760
Yeah, or you know just have fun and experiment like if you get like a Nexus device

51:17.760 --> 51:21.560
I've in the past just let's let's go to an area and I'll activate this one

51:21.560 --> 51:24.560
And then I'll put it in and then I have the other one active and I just switch between them

51:24.560 --> 51:27.720
And you know it's a little bit of hassle, but not bad and on the newer devices

51:27.720 --> 51:33.160
It's even easier and just do a speed test. I offered to give a wimpy a timsling. Oh really yeah for what he's out here

51:33.160 --> 51:36.080
Yeah, he has global roaming, so he doesn't need it, but I was like hey

51:36.080 --> 51:38.840
Hey coming to the US do you need a SIM card cuz I can hook you up, bro

51:38.840 --> 51:39.680
I could hook you up

51:39.680 --> 51:40.920
That's awesome, dude

51:40.920 --> 51:46.920
And they have a really great control panel to the let's you manage all aspects of your account set limits alerts turn things off

51:47.160 --> 51:51.320
So like right now not driving to Texas don't need my team if I on it's great

51:51.840 --> 51:55.320
You know and the other thing is even if I left it on it's six dollars a month for the line

51:55.320 --> 52:00.160
That's it those are the kind of things that are other providers that feel like you're like breaking a rule or doing something shady

52:00.160 --> 52:05.280
But I think they're like no that this is your plan your minutes like just use them when you or you know feeling bad for

52:05.280 --> 52:09.560
Having like a $30 a month device in your not use yeah, but if routine it's six bucks

52:09.560 --> 52:14.160
And then it's just when you use it you pay for the usage just minutes message in megabytes and whatever you use

52:14.160 --> 52:19.280
That's what you pay and six dollars for the line is so simple so straightforward bring a device buy one from ting

52:19.280 --> 52:22.360
They don't care just try them out. They also have a calculator

52:22.360 --> 52:27.320
You can see how much you would save and a blog that's full of good tips even if you're not yet a ting customer

52:27.320 --> 52:32.060
Just go to linux dot ting dot com linux dot ting dot com and a big

52:32.060 --> 52:34.740
Thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

52:35.400 --> 52:40.360
Big event coming up, and this is almost the perfect representation of how this event works

52:40.960 --> 52:43.840
This know what do you agree if you disagree? I'm sure you'll speak up

52:44.840 --> 52:46.360
me

52:46.360 --> 52:53.060
Really next fest Northwest has the possibility of becoming the largest community organized event in the United States yes

52:54.440 --> 52:56.120
and I

52:56.120 --> 53:01.600
Love these guys, but they really got some problems still right now their websites down. They got a Drupal issue

53:01.600 --> 53:03.600
It looks like they're my SQL server is down

53:04.640 --> 53:10.840
They have issues on the website. They say still on the website say it's gonna be announcing their schedule in the coming weeks now

53:10.840 --> 53:15.480
I'm not saying any of this to criticize. I am pointing out that this is truly a lug run event

53:15.480 --> 53:18.160
It is like an event of the people and there's certain things

53:18.160 --> 53:21.960
They're stronger at right like putting on a hell of a good event, and there's certain things

53:21.960 --> 53:24.480
They're not so strong at like planning a whole bit of it. Yeah

53:28.480 --> 53:33.440
Love about it, dude. We not polished. It's not I mean, but it but it works right as we know it's gonna happen

53:33.440 --> 53:37.920
We're gonna be there, and it's gonna be awesome being in contact. You know from the broadcasting side

53:37.920 --> 53:42.600
We get a lot of behind-the-scenes things that you know we don't necessarily share with a lot of other people and

53:42.600 --> 53:48.360
basically all suffice to say that a lot of things in the Linux landscape are changing a little bit and there is a

53:49.000 --> 53:52.720
Opportunity here for Linux fest to become the Linux fest to go to

53:53.200 --> 53:55.120
So if we could get some of these issues worked out

53:55.120 --> 53:59.420
That'd be really great because and even if they don't work them out to be honest with you. Just show up

53:59.520 --> 54:03.200
That's my answer people ask me. They're like I couldn't register because the just show up

54:03.200 --> 54:03.720
Oh, yeah

54:03.720 --> 54:08.460
Just show up if you if you have trouble just show up and if you if anyone gives you if anyone gives you know

54:08.460 --> 54:11.200
You will not be turned away. You know the sites back up now

54:11.200 --> 54:13.200
So maybe that's good you know, but I've heard

54:13.240 --> 54:14.840
They're getting a lot of traffic

54:14.840 --> 54:18.160
Maybe that's it maybe they're getting you know and they just have it on some like in a little server

54:18.160 --> 54:19.680
And now it's getting a bunch of traffic office

54:19.680 --> 54:22.320
I wouldn't put it past these guys to be running this on about Raspberry Pi

54:22.560 --> 54:27.960
No, there's a kind of thing they would do totally the slackware server x486 there crashed

54:27.960 --> 54:32.960
We bought a restart there was a time there would so you know it's May 6th and 7th

54:32.960 --> 54:36.160
we're gonna be streaming it live at jblive.tv if you want to check it out and

54:36.160 --> 54:43.880
It also be where we record the last Linux action show. Mm-hmm. Wow. Wow, that's crazy. That's wow end of an era

54:43.880 --> 54:50.480
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and then almost immediately we launched into whole new projects user air comes back the Linux action news show

54:50.800 --> 54:56.100
It's gonna be big Joe and I are getting really ready. We're going through final things now on the show so exciting

54:56.100 --> 54:58.480
Yeah, it is. It is really it is really fun

54:58.480 --> 55:03.040
It's been a long time since I've done something like this and I think it's gonna be a big big hit

55:03.040 --> 55:05.240
I hope I hope people like it. We'll see maybe they'll hate it

55:05.240 --> 55:10.780
I don't know. Well, you'll get some of both. That's just a guarantee. Yeah. Yeah, and then I'll just switch to vlogging full-time

55:12.880 --> 55:19.400
Anyway, so when you have time to edit as yeah as is always as is always the case when the Linux fest is near

55:20.200 --> 55:26.460
We like to punish ourselves. We like to punish our bodies. We like to punish our mental spirit stomachs

55:26.460 --> 55:31.320
We like to punish. Yes, we definitely punish our stomachs and we punish equipment too, by the way, Wes

55:31.320 --> 55:33.500
Sorry, you may have bad lighting for text now

55:33.500 --> 55:34.500
Yeah

55:34.500 --> 55:38.900
Yeah, we have that why you look so good on Sunday. Yeah, we did

55:38.900 --> 55:42.740
We actually did not have the right lighting on Sunday either. So since last Friday

55:43.660 --> 55:49.820
Well, yeah since last Friday Todd has it only been a week. We've been basically so much longer than who he said not

55:49.820 --> 55:55.460
Yeah, not even no, but it's been the Friday before last right? Oh, yeah, that's right. Okay, that feels better. Yeah the Friday before last

55:56.180 --> 56:00.880
It's been a lot of work. We started we ripped out everything in the studio pulled out every single wire

56:00.880 --> 56:05.840
Every everything we were down to the four walls in the ceiling for a while. Yeah, boy, and then we've been

56:06.760 --> 56:08.760
And that was the last time a Mac was in here

56:09.400 --> 56:12.520
And it's just ever knows. Those were the first two things I took out

56:13.160 --> 56:17.960
Like literally I unplugged it carried it out and I was like, okay now we can go with the rest

56:17.960 --> 56:20.360
Just set it in the backyard. Let it graze. I

56:21.040 --> 56:23.040
Was actually nice to it stay on target

56:23.480 --> 56:26.840
Stay on target. No, then we we rebuilt

56:26.840 --> 56:31.400
with a with around around a couple of core ideas

56:32.480 --> 56:34.480
we rebuilt with the idea of

56:35.180 --> 56:40.720
Supporting the production of the new shows and now the existing shows we have so this studio was built for a different set of requirements

56:40.720 --> 56:44.560
And now we essentially rebuilt the studio for the new set of requirements

56:44.560 --> 56:49.040
So that was the first thing then the second thing we built it around was all Linux. So everything's Linux

56:49.600 --> 56:52.240
Even down to our mixer, which is Linux

56:52.240 --> 56:57.200
We we put everything everything around that and then of course, that's really the third thing because the mixer is so huge

56:57.520 --> 56:59.520
which is not a final mixer, but

57:00.600 --> 57:03.920
It's all kind of built around that so we've we've we've made a lot of changes

57:03.920 --> 57:07.800
We've made I can't I can't show it on camera, but we've made additional room for guests

57:07.800 --> 57:13.160
So we'll be able to have guests in studio mic'd up be able to hear everybody. It's way more like clean and efficient

57:13.160 --> 57:15.160
Yeah, it's lots more

57:15.160 --> 57:20.200
My favorite part of the whole studio renovation is after ten years Chris finally found where he wanted his microphone. Yeah

57:20.200 --> 57:25.720
Yeah, actually he's not kidding. So for the first time in ten years really eleven years of brought actually twelve years because I

57:26.320 --> 57:28.320
Before Jupiter broadcasting I had a couple of things

57:28.600 --> 57:32.600
I could never ever every time you buy a microphone stand on a boom stand

57:32.600 --> 57:36.120
It comes with a desk lamp and something that you can drill into your desk

57:36.120 --> 57:41.920
Mm-hmm, and I've never been able to commit to it because you know when video production like I some I'm moving stuff around all the time

57:41.920 --> 57:46.160
And you're almost for every shoot like I have a dive a laptop this time this next time

57:46.160 --> 57:51.440
I'm doing a capture the next time it's two people and so you just can't be static and you can't just lock things down

57:51.440 --> 57:56.640
And so did we or did we not just nail the position of that finally after ten years?

57:56.640 --> 58:00.240
I found the perfect spot. No, I got it drilled there drilled it in my hand actually

58:01.320 --> 58:03.320
with his brown bear muscles and

58:03.520 --> 58:11.120
And then we finally actually mounted a a microphone to the table. It's fixed in place. You can move around. It's great

58:11.120 --> 58:13.120
It's on it. It's on a gesticulating arm. I

58:13.120 --> 58:15.120
Enjoy

58:17.800 --> 58:22.240
So it's an almost perfect position we've got a touchscreen over here for something I'm about to talk about

58:22.880 --> 58:28.500
The all of this is it's really built around now making higher quality productions better better than ever

58:28.500 --> 58:34.880
Wes is at least I hope but to my to my left here. We're running something called caster soundboard

58:34.880 --> 58:41.720
It was a project that was created for a juke for Jupiter broadcasting by a coda radio listener caster soundboard is

58:41.720 --> 58:48.000
Sort of a recreation of proprietary software that's available for macOS to do a production soundboard, you know, we're like we

58:48.560 --> 58:54.040
Fire off sounds like that. This is written in c++ and q5. It's GPL

58:54.040 --> 58:57.800
It's up on github you go to github.com slash Jupiter broadcasting to see it and

58:58.480 --> 59:00.480
It's really close to being perfect

59:00.600 --> 59:05.680
It just needs a few tweaks and we have open issues for what needs to be fixed and we're hoping

59:06.040 --> 59:10.200
We're hoping maybe folks in the community would be willing to work with

59:10.200 --> 59:13.320
That yeah, so I don't know if it shows up on the webcam here

59:13.320 --> 59:16.640
So for those of you watching the video over here, we have a this is a 1080p

59:17.480 --> 59:21.320
21 inch Dell touchscreen monitor and I can I can try you want me to try it?

59:21.320 --> 59:22.440
We have one clip in there

59:22.440 --> 59:28.720
This is this is from the open source soundboard running on Linux using a touchscreen and it's got a little button right there

59:28.720 --> 59:33.440
But let's see. That's dark dirt dirt. Did you not hook up the USB port? Never mind?

59:33.440 --> 59:35.840
No, it is no it is fast looking up the

59:35.840 --> 59:40.800
USB card I was I jumped ahead. But anyways, isn't that look great Wes like from what you know

59:40.800 --> 59:45.780
You've seen my past soundboard setup. This is this is it right here. This is a this is a dedicated soundboard setup

59:45.780 --> 59:51.240
It's got multiple tabs. It's all written and cute. It's essentially touchable. It's not perfect, but it's touchable

59:52.280 --> 59:55.480
Oh, it's muted. There we go. This is from this is it right here

59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.820
And one of the things that's really nice is every button is triggerable by a keyboard

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:07.260
But what I'd also like is I'd like each tile to be pressable and playable. I'd like it to be

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:12.300
And if the volume slider was a little bit bigger, I'd be able to slide volume and stuff like that

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:16.820
So it's really really close. We don't have the ability currently to save or export soundboard

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:22.580
So if the application closes you lose the entire soundboard, so there's details in there that here's your principal

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:25.700
Here's how here's how here's how he prompts work out of me. This is how he gets free labor

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:28.300
He just he's like a soundboard up yet. I'm like, yeah, you know

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:33.100
Close but he's like, well, I could get a dungu and a MacBook. Go get the MacBook in here

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.460
Come on no, you don't want a Mac in here do you?

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:40.260
So we find a developer we're like, yeah

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:44.220
But if there's anyone out there that wants to work on this do we have links in the coder radio show notes?

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:46.740
Yeah, I'll put them in here too. Yeah, and it's you can also just find it

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:52.680
We have it pinned at the top of github.com slash Jupiter broadcasting. Sweet. Yeah, it'd be really because oh, here's the thing Noah

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.540
tell me the thing is

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:58.940
there's a few open source projects that we've now been involved with like show bot and a

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:03.340
Couple other things like pod publish and whatnot that I think we can help out and we can you know

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:07.180
And people have like there's like many podcasts now that use some of the stuff

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:10.260
We've written a j-bot sure and they have their own title

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.740
Suggestion systems and all that kind of stuff and it's helped podcasters

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:17.140
Mm-hmm, and I think this is another one because it there's nothing that says it has to run on Linux

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:21.260
I mean, that's what we're using it for but other but if it's just an open source soundboard

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:25.620
I think that'd be useful for people in general not just Linux users. Yeah, it could be a very big

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:31.540
No, actually, I would not mind if nobody ever bothered to fork it outside of Linux and we just and that became

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:38.940
Like you want the world's best podcasting sound where you're gonna run Linux. Yeah, maybe yeah, maybe we could get there

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:45.240
I'm not the thing just be and stand on but could just be an AUR or flat pack away or maybe a snap package one day

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:48.060
Either way, if you if you'd like to help us boy

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:53.260
Would we appreciate it because it would basically improve all of the Jupiter broadcasting shows and it's really the last thing that the Mac's better

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:58.180
At in here like I can objectively say in my opinion everything else in here that we've replaced with

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:03.220
Amazing is the only thing the Mac can do is play random clips, isn't that stupid?

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.140
But I mean in terms of what you actually say it all out

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:10.900
Yeah, I kind of but if you actually had you ever done it as a living and used to use a soundboard before you understand

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:13.860
It is a very piece important piece of equipment because it's not just about playing stupid noises

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:20.220
It's also how the music's done in the show right intros outro. Yeah, like it's it's actually a pretty critical piece of equipment

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.020
So you want it to work right and right objectively?

01:02:23.020 --> 01:02:28.100
It's the only piece of software slash equipment that we've replaced that is a very much a downgrade

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:31.980
Everything else has been an upgrade in terms of performance reliability functionality

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.780
All of it and then obviously the fact that it's free and open source

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.340
Yeah, this would be the one thing that is not quite there

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.420
But it's so I'd say it's like 60% of the way

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:45.640
I think it's like 60% of the way and what's amazing is it was put together by you remember the community member guy that he

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:50.060
Was Xerox was it Xerox? No, no, he's the guy that may be working up, but it started with a C

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:55.860
Yeah, I wish I hadn't but anyways, he was so super cool worked with me before and we kind of a couple people work on

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.860
We also had a web-based one that was worked on this

01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:03.700
We really like this one because we have the touchscreen here. Yeah, you can you can just see looking at that how useful that would be

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.740
So yeah

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:10.460
Caster soundboard and when we get it done, it could be something that takes off wouldn't just be for podcasting either

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.460
Mm-hmm. Could just be fun to have a soundboard

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.860
What you want to go we should probably get going in a little bit

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.060
But I wanted to talk a little about laptops and battery life

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:21.740
Yeah, so why don't we start with a question that came into the subreddit by a pursue doof?

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:25.020
I think is he had a question about the setup on the MacBook

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:30.380
Running Linux arts Linux on the 2013 MacBook and I said, you know, essentially system

01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:36.140
D boot was what was used to do the boot management. I use the built-in you if I manager the Mac has when you hold

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.980
Down the option key to get to that point

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:42.820
and the Linux dash MacBook package from the AUR were some of the bigger like

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:47.780
Important components and so he followed up with a couple of specific questions, and I thought maybe I'd talk to you

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:49.860
He said as you know

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:56.340
Do we see of a way to switch between the integrated Intel GPU and the dedicated Nvidia because I think the way we did my config

01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:59.260
Was just dedicated Nvidia all the time. I think that's right

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:04.460
Yeah, so that was one thing he wanted something on so I don't know if we have that don't know that that's worth looking into

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:08.040
You though and then he also and this is one I will toss out to the audience if yet

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.900
If you what would you guys do for snapshots?

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:12.660
Would you go with LVM? Would you do ZFS?

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:16.820
Would you do butter FS clonezilla if you want to do snapshots of your system?

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:22.380
My personal take would be clonezilla, but did you have any I would do clonezilla? Yeah. I mean, I guess it depends on how

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:27.620
How frequently what kind of downtime are you willing to support?

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:32.100
What what is your use case and how comfortable are you experimenting if you're okay with LVM?

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:34.540
I think LVM snapshots have gotten a lot better in recent years

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:36.240
If you're okay

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.140
If you're already experienced with ZFS then just do that because you'll have a great time with it if you know how to use it

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:45.660
Administer it if not then definitely don't do that and yeah, maybe clonezilla or something where sure you it's not as frequent

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:49.140
It's not like just instant, but you know it's reliable understandable thing

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:53.000
I like about the thing I like about clonzilla is I can store it totally off the machine

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:59.020
To receive I mean yeah, oh yeah, you could do that. Yeah, I would say this though. I

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:04.660
Was also of the mindset that I better have snapshots for this MacBook because I know it's gonna break on me

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:09.580
Just like the pseudo devs just thinking of and it really has been fine. I've done many kernel updates

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:14.420
I think I even I even did an like a complete OS upgrade to Final Cut OS Sierra

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:19.940
And I think it's nothing was affected like I just hold down the option key and choose Linux, and it's just fine

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:23.780
It's great. Yeah, so I I found it to be pretty reliable

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:25.940
I was surprised how reliable it was on there

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:30.800
So you might just give it a go, but I did notice one thing that's definite

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:34.500
It's obvious that the battery life under Final Cut OS

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:39.340
when not editing is superior to just Linux you know just say you're browsing the web and

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:45.420
And Final Cut OS is gonna switch between the Intel and video graphics whereas Linux is always on the Nvidia graphics

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.420
right, but the battery life difference is like

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:52.780
Seven and a half hours to an hour and a half to two hours like it's a huge matter

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:53.700
It is a big difference

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:58.740
And I I don't know what is going on with Linux battery life right now because across all my laptops

01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:03.060
It's not really where it should be it's not that bad. That's the worst but across all of them

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.780
Mmm. It seems like it's have you noticed this have you have you struggled with this?

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.460
I know you were saying a co-worker struggled with this recently yeah, you know I did

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:14.100
I did know someone in my life who you know he's done Linux stuff for a long a long time

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.100
He uses it at work

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:20.220
You know very good on the command line had no he's like hadn't dabbled that much in the desktop side of Linux

01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:22.500
And so he you know got himself a new laptop. I'm not sure which one

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:26.620
Installed the latest Ubuntu on it and just had a hell of a time

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:29.820
You know getting anything like decent bad, but I don't think he did any configuration

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:33.500
But just running out of the gate you know he installed it kind of got us up and running boom batteries dead

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:37.580
Which is not a great first run experience, and he'd already you know when he came with Windows

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:40.900
And we just ran at that it was you know eight eight hours of battery life. Oh easy

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:44.140
And so you know I was kind of like we were I was talking people who are

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:48.060
It's like okay. Well we start giving them some tips about what to do, but it's like okay

01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:51.780
Well is there ever are we ever gonna get to a point where you know even?

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.500
mainstream distros have some of these changes out of the gate or

01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:00.340
Optionally for a couple distros like Ubuntu Mate edition does some decent battery

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:05.020
Loving tweaks out of the box that some other distros don't do so I know that's one of them

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:11.420
But yeah, so there is some distro differential as you might say a distro the diff the distro differential indeed

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:17.700
But it's still I think across the board since I really would say since kernel 4. It's just been shit I

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:22.660
Think it's gone down. I think it's yeah, I think it's been bad since version 4 of the Linux kernel

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:23.900
I don't really think it's ever come back up

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:27.620
And I don't really care so it's not like I talk about it very often because to me

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:29.780
I just need my better to last long enough between where I have plugs

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.740
Right you know it's funny. I'm in a totally different boat for me

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.380
I need my battery to last only from the time. I leave my house

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:39.580
So time I get back because I won't have plugs usually do you know you get great battery life

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:44.660
Yeah, you know about 16 hours well, but then again. I have there's three batteries in that ThinkPad. You know effectively so

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:50.560
Not the best test. Yeah, I see what you mean there. Yeah, I so does anybody in the virtual log

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.660
there have anything that they do to save battery life like maybe TLP or

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:57.420
Powertop because I know those are things you can do with power top for example

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:00.740
You can at least get a sense of what's draining your battery, which is a very useful tool

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:05.340
But that's maybe old-school is there new things people are using to figure out what's sucking down battery life

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:10.580
I'd love to know any new tips because from where I'm at I feel like I have a limited set of tools really track it down

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:16.040
Earlier I'll add it to the show notes architect in the IRC room posted a good link that kind of had a rundown

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:22.420
These days it seems like TLP is the most popular at least what people are talking about the most and seems to be the most

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.540
up-to-date or most modern

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:25.900
and

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:30.340
And you know is one of the ones laptop mode tools being the other one where you know you can kind of just install it

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:35.880
And generally forget about it. I think TLP has less config that you might want to do or able to do

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:39.040
So if that might just work for you, and then of course yeah

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.060
There's power top which can be very useful especially if you're just trying to understand things you're writing your own

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:46.980
You'd have rules, or you're just like oh. Yeah, it's it's this thing all the time

01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:49.660
I'm just gonna disable that hardware or not use that program and

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:54.460
Sandy bridge and was that the was that the Intel release that you hated no I hated

01:08:54.460 --> 01:09:00.500
Sky like sandy bridge and sky like if I recall both had issues like with their p-state driver

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:05.300
Where which screws with like the CPU scaling and just burns battery life like crazy, too

01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:07.440
So that hasn't helped either and that was an Intel problem

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.500
That's not really a mean it's a Linux kernel problem because it's in the kernel right, but it's Intel code

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:15.420
And I feel like we're just kind of getting that solved in like 412

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:16.620
I think yeah

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:21.180
Didn't we just have a new release come out like today or yesterday to of the Linux from I think 411 just yeah

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:25.700
Yeah, and that's not in there. I don't think but I'm not sure did you you did a little rundown of it

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:27.700
Did you see that in there when you were doing it didn't?

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:31.220
No, that's a good question. Yeah, I didn't see it in there when I went I went through your notes

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:34.340
Wested a nice little breakdown of what was in there

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:38.620
We never even put it in the show, but it happened during our show prep period and I saw it in there

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:42.820
It's like okay that might be something worth talking about but that's still not I still doesn't fix it on

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:49.220
Yeah, yeah, you mostly called out LZ for improvements to software raid and sip hash

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:50.780
which

01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:54.420
Sounds interesting. Yeah, this is a new hash algorithm that people are

01:09:55.620 --> 01:10:00.420
But not a piece a driver fix not a not a really not we'll have to go review the kernel newbies

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:03.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe it's maybe it's something buried in the details there

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.260
But I know that's been that's also been part of what's causing this

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:09.700
I know I know from reading some like of Matthew Garrett's older posts

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:14.700
Remember him talk about you know these days more and more things are being combined not to like one chipset or linked together

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.780
Whereas it's separately they used to be you know more separate components

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:23.140
And so now you have to get the power states right on all the components for the group of them to power down sufficiently

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.900
So that's not helping us very much. No, that's

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.340
complicated yeah

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:33.580
Well, I guess I would say this if you have a great tool for sort of tracking this problem down

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.820
Or you if you've solved it on a more recent

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:41.540
Ubuntu or or or distro because one of the other problems I have is when I when I looked I did see some stuff

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:46.740
But mostly what I saw was like really old guides. Mm-hmm. I'm like is this from 2009?

01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.740
I don't think that's a good idea

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:54.460
so I would kind of like to see something maybe submit a few articles for the subreddit Linux action show dot reddit comm or

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:59.860
You can send them in directly to the show go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact and put it in that way

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.620
Maybe I know power tops

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:06.260
I mean so those ones the basics we know but some other cool ways to track it down like one thing I was thinking about

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:11.180
this is really stupid, but like if it's just something you wanted to stay on top of all the time and just sort of

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:17.220
Whittle it down is what would happen if you just put a temperature sensor extension on gnome and just look to the devices

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:22.180
They're running hot all the time and track it down that way like if your CPUs seems like it's running hot or your GPU is

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.700
Something hitting that more than it should yeah

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:29.280
I could at least give you an indication that something's working hard because the power obviously would translate to heat somewhere

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:33.100
Yeah, so it might be a way to start mr. Mr. Noah before we go

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.980
Why don't you tell the people at home where they can find you and maybe what other shows?

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:38.180
Yeah at Colonel Linux at least for one more week

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:44.120
the Linux action show on Sundays and the ask Noah show 6 p.m. Central jblive.tv and if you're in Grand Forks and

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.500
keqq 88.3 o pfm and

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:51.660
Give that number around eight five five four five zero Noah. That's one eight five five four five zero six six two four

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:55.980
That's what I want to do. I want to make that number the thing that people say well. I'm getting started with Linux

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:59.100
Okay, well here here at six o'clock on Monday. Yeah, give these guys a call

01:11:59.100 --> 01:11:59.780
You know yeah

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:04.060
You know we should do is for swag wouldn't be awesome if we had like business cards that were like

01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:08.160
You have a have a have you know need Linux help call call one eight five five

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:13.780
And we still could it's new it's early so well not I mean for Linux fest

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.780
Oh, yeah, that would be good to give out at Linux fest the people hand out

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.900
I'm I might I might see what I can do about that

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:24.740
I'm gonna get something printed because it's just basically be like a little card that says need Linux support call what he got

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.420
I'm five five four five zero Noah

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:31.420
That's one eight five five four five zero six six two four and it's live on Mondays if you want to tune in and call in

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:34.340
I would be a specific. Yeah, 7 p.m.. Eastern 6 p.m.. Central

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:40.680
The thing is like I started by just doing Pacific time and then the radio station

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.300
We're like why are you always giving in Pacific time? We're in Central time

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:47.300
I'm like okay well 4 p.m.. Pacific and 6 p.m.. Central then people wrote in and they're like

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:52.060
Why don't you give it Eastern time really everyone measures in Eastern and Pacific time and I'm like 7 p.m.. Eastern

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:54.060
So I just like rotate between the three

01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:59.300
And then mr.. West there's places people can find you outside this show as well. Yes, that's right

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:03.820
I'm at West Payne on Twitter, and if you just stay tuned you'll catch me on the tech snap program

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.180
Which is coming up next?

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:10.340
Very well very good, and I'm excited about that and there is some big news this week for the tech snap program

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:14.460
I am at Chris LAS the network is at Jupiter signal the vlog is

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:21.960
Youtube.com slash Chris Fisher tune in live this weekend at jblive.tv for our Linux fest Northwest coverage Wow

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:24.180
It's finally here

01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:29.460
That time of year again, and you can also keep up to date on that coverage at Jupiter signal on the tweeters

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:34.500
Even if you don't use the tweeter you can still read the feeds. I know it's crazy. Thanks for being here

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.040
If you want to join our virtual lug next week

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:39.600
You'll have to show up live go to jblive.tv for that you put a broadcasting comm slash calendar

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.920
And if you want to give us your feedback Linux action show dot reddit comm at least for a little bit longer

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.540
What?

01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:54.820
I'll leave you with that. Thanks for joining us. We'll see you right back here next Tuesday. See you later everybody

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.540
Oh

01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:46.420
JB titles calm everybody go to JB titles calm. Let's pick that title good show Wes good job

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:51.100
Good job podcasting now. What do you think? Did you see any titles go by that you like? I actually haven't looked yet

01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:53.140
Yeah, I haven't either

01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:58.940
I'm excited about Linux fest. I think it's gonna be a good time. Well, it's gonna be a good it's gonna be great

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:03.900
Windows 10 sucker edition. That's kind of funny and gabien was right that I like that too

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:06.940
Windows 10 Titanic edition

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:09.860
Windows is the S

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.900
We also have kill dash 9 grub 2 oh

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.900
Oh, man, I got the burps right now

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:22.260
The burps wouldn't rub a dub grub. That is money. I like that one. That's good, too. We're system T. That's funny

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:26.660
I where's rub a dub grub. I got to give that about that's going on. That's going up fast

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:34.180
That's going up really fast people like that battery life myths Linux shenanigans a hoppy lup. Yeah, it was that's true

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:40.180
Mm-hmm max unplugged. I get it the max unplugged. That's pretty good. Oh, is that what your solution is?

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:45.580
It's all right, it's good. It's good. It's good. No, that's fine. It's fine. Rub a dub grubs going up there. Let's go with it

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.580
I think that's perfect. I think that's perfect

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:52.900
All right, you know what's funny is we got the sky cam in here and that was done like at the last minute

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:57.820
We did that during the show. It was perfect. Oh, yeah, that was good. That's good. I like the sky cam. All right chat room

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:02.140
Thank you for being here. Thank you everybody for listening at home and oh good hashtag blame

01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:10.260
Noah's going up on the list. Okay. Now we can officially we can officially in the show
