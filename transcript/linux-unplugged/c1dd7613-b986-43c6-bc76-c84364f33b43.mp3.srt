00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,240
Breaking news, tweet coming into the show from Richard Brown, Chairman Richard Brown.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,360
OpenSUSE has solved all of ButterFS's issues.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,160
This started on a tweet thread coming at me, a tweet, I'm not going to be using ButterFS

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
on my system.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,000
I've had some issues with it.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,860
And OpenSUSE has responded with a blog post where Richard writes, ever wondered how to

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,160
manually set up ButterFS root file systems the same way we do in OpenSUSE?

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,920
For all of you other distributions that are getting ButterFS wrong, you're simply just

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,720
setting it up wrong.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,260
Like the words of the deceased Steve Jobs, you're holding your ButterFS wrong.

11
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,040
And one of our listeners tweets back, I'm still concerned about file system issues,

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
free space issues.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,360
I just don't think ButterFS has a place on production desktops.

14
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,280
Richard Brown responds.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,520
Thank you for your feedback.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,880
But those issues have been long addressed.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,960
There you have it, everybody.

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,800
There you have it right now.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,600
This is CNN Breaking News.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,880
Live from OpenSUSE, confirmed all of ButterFS's issues have been resolved.

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,560
Format ZFS and install ButterFS.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,560
Have at it, kids.

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,280
Can I imagine I jumped from OpenSUSE?

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,200
No, really, you are our OpenSUSE guy.

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,760
Now all we have is Gabriel.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
What are you talking about?

28
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,880
You are our OpenSUSE guy, Eric.

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,080
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

30
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,320
It has problems with audio production.

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Oh, really?

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
What kind of problems?

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,120
There's just not enough software availability.

34
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,840
Software fails to compile on it that would normally compile, like say on Fedora, which

35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,840
is why I jumped to the Fedora Jam remix.

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,080
Oh, hold on, I think Mr. Payne's at the door.

37
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Continue on.

38
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,880
I thought that the build service was a solution for that, though.

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,480
The build service is a solution for that, but the problem is getting the spec files

40
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
to go.

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:08,160
It just ended up being a hassle, whereas it was all available on Fedora already.

42
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,560
I don't have to go through that hassle.

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,680
I can just set up a system and boom, done.

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Really?

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,120
All of a sudden, I have a Linux box able to help me with my audio production.

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,760
I'm going to check that out.

47
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:25,720
I got to say, if Fedora is easier, then it must be pretty bad over there.

48
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,080
It follows my old rule of shades of niche, and it goes a little something like this,

49
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
my friends.

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,840
The closer you are to Windows, the better time you're going to have as far as application

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,680
compatibility, support, performance, and reliability.

52
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,920
This is not an argument to run Windows because the platform is trash, but the closer you

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,960
are to Windows, the better your chances are going to be.

54
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,560
Now then your next step out, your next niche step out is Mac OS.

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,700
Mac OS, you could say the same thing, a little bit more application compatibility, but not

56
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,200
create as good as Windows.

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,040
More people writing software for the Mac, but not as much as Windows.

58
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,600
Then you go another step out, and that's Linux.

59
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,480
Really that's Ubuntu.

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,760
Ubuntu has the next, the third niche out is Ubuntu.

61
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,000
Now if you want to go a fourth step out, now you're looking at Fedora, you're looking

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,840
at Arch, you're looking at general Linux, and then there is yet another step out, and

63
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,360
that is OpenSUSE.

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,440
These weird Germans who have a very particular way of building things, they got to have their

65
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,400
own build system, they got to have their own boot splash, oh wait, no they don't, that's

66
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
dead.

67
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,000
And then there is yet a fifth dimension, and that is FreeBSD.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,480
And that is really out on the fringes.

69
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,480
The least amount of desktop application compatibility, the least amount of industry desktop support,

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,400
and that's where you live on FreeBSD.

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,240
And you just got to pick which flavor of niche is right for you.

72
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,320
You know something, I did try Ubuntu Studio, and just raw Ubuntu, and it didn't hold a

73
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,960
candle to Fedora Jam.

74
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,760
Fedora Jam?

75
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Yeah.

76
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
It didn't hold a candle.

77
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
You got to try it, Wes.

78
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,480
What do you think, Wes?

79
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,480
Fedora Jam.

80
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
Tasty jam.

81
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
I do like jam.

82
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Yeah, me too.

83
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,520
Mmm, spread it all over.

84
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:20,880
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 233 for January 23rd, 2018.

85
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux podcast is downloading distros and preparing

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,720
for a canonical invasion.

87
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
My name is Chris.

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
My name is Wes.

89
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Hello, Wes.

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Glad to have you back.

91
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,280
I hope you're feeling much better.

92
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
Much better.

93
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Ready for Linux.

94
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,680
Yeah, well, we have a lot of Linux to get into, sir.

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,880
An old friend is back in the news.

96
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,720
The lady tube that is here to save us all, the lady tube that represents freedom, the

97
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,440
original lady tube is back with an update.

98
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:55,880
Then we'll get into a few, a smattering, a batch, a corner, if you will, of Ubuntu and

99
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,880
Gnome 3 news, as well as Firefox news, which damn, if it's not time to switch to Firefox

100
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,600
is definitely going to be after this week's episode, two, count them one, count them two

101
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,800
different app picks this week, including one that Wes found that's so damn cool, we almost

102
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,560
saved it for an entirely different show.

103
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,320
We'll tell you about that.

104
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,200
And then a critical tool that we use on this network, a lot of streamers use it, it's crushing

105
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,000
the proprietary competition, has gotten a major update this week.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,120
We'll tell you about the new OBS Studio and why it may just wipe your bottom.

107
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,760
Stay tuned for that.

108
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,800
And then later on in the show, rumor has it, the Mate project just got a little bit better

109
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,640
looking and one of the original Linux news sources has been around for 20 years.

110
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:51,040
We'll celebrate 20 years of LWN at the end of the show and then we'll end it with a question.

111
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,560
Is native Linux app development in decline and why is that?

112
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,520
What caused the state of app development?

113
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,720
And I can tell you as somebody who used to do weekly app picks.

114
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
The answer is yes.

115
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
So we'll talk about that more.

116
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,280
But first we've got to bring in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings, mumble, rooooooooooooh.

117
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
Hello.

118
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Hello.

119
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Oh, hi there.

120
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Hello.

121
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Hey guys.

122
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
There's a lot of people.

123
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
Did you hear all those people?

124
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
There's a lot of people.

125
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
I sure did.

126
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
That's a little weird.

127
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
This will be a good episode.

128
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,600
They're all just right there in my ears.

129
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,520
So we've all been wondering, what about Mycroft?

130
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
Right?

131
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,880
Haven't we all been kind of like, hey, what about Mycroft?

132
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Yeah.

133
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,960
So obviously the solution is another crowd funder introducing mark two.

134
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,720
Mycroft has announced specs for a new voice assistant.

135
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,840
They've been building towards this.

136
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,920
They recently did a blog post about the lessons they learned from their previous crowd funders.

137
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,960
So they kind of been setting the groundwork for this.

138
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,000
And they've been sort of giving everybody a reminder of why open source is better for

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,600
privacy and it's better for these kinds of devices inherently.

140
00:06:52,600 --> 00:07:00,360
And today they're announcing the new Mycroft mark two, which will be more like a speaker

141
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,380
tube, an upright standing tube that has a very large touch screen.

142
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,580
I believe it's touch screen on the front of it.

143
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,720
It's an informational screen.

144
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,160
So who wants to just get a whole jumble of words when you can get a display?

145
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,800
And they're going to be launching this on, I think it's called thunderclap, if I recall

146
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
it.

147
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,480
Yeah, thunderclap is where they're going.

148
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,220
And I think it's happening the Thursday of this recording.

149
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,040
So depending on when you're listening, it could be happening right now.

150
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,760
And it's a brand new version of Mycroft that is more competitive.

151
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,400
It's more in the line of the big, large super speaker that you're seeing with Apple's HomePod

152
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,080
and the Google Macs.

153
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,240
And it's also more in line with the Google show, or I'm sorry, the Echo show or the

154
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,320
Echo spot, which all have screens on them.

155
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,360
And then they have what they call hero cards that display information along with the verbal

156
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
request.

157
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Mycroft, you're my hero.

158
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,160
What do you think, Wes, is this it?

159
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,720
Is this going to crack that nut?

160
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,200
It's at least further along the way.

161
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,520
It's if they can make it look that good.

162
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
I'm intrigued.

163
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,180
You know, really, of course, what it comes down to is like, what's the level of voice

164
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,180
interaction?

165
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,180
How painless is it?

166
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,200
And it can it meet, you know, what the other large vendors are doing that time will have

167
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
to tell.

168
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,200
If anybody in the Mumble Room has any thoughts at this stage, you're welcome to jump in.

169
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,880
And I see, JJ, you have something you thought might be worth mentioning.

170
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Go ahead.

171
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,200
Yeah, I guess this sort of interest in me pursuing a little bit of open source, Linux

172
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,120
especially, I'm sort of interested in what Mycroft has to offer in terms of competition

173
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,720
and in terms of an alternative to the data sucking lady tubes that we know, well, thanks

174
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
for the term.

175
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Lady tubes that we know such as Google and the credit Amazon word that I'm not supposed

176
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
to mention.

177
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
She who must not be named.

178
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Don't trigger.

179
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Don't trigger.

180
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Yeah.

181
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
OK.

182
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Beard, talk me down.

183
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
What do you think?

184
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,000
Or maybe you think maybe you'll agree with me.

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,440
I think desktop Linux, the year of desktop Linux has a better shot than this does as

186
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,680
a as a product.

187
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,320
I think that the Libra five has a better chance of selling five million devices than this

188
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,080
does as a product.

189
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,460
In other words, I think it's a long shot.

190
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,160
Can you walk me back from that position?

191
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
No, I agree.

192
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
Yeah.

193
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
OK.

194
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,560
Another another poignant argument.

195
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
What do you think, Wimby?

196
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,480
Can you walk me back from that argument?

197
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Probably not.

198
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,240
What about the slow burn effect of open source?

199
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,160
What about that long, slow and steady approach?

200
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:40,760
So Microsoft released a video recently of it being adapted for use in a car.

201
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,340
And I imagine that that was some kind of prototype that they were doing as a proof of concept.

202
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:52,660
But maybe the success of Microsoft isn't consumer sales, but integration into other equipment

203
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,660
and devices.

204
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,660
Right.

205
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,080
That is definitely what I was thinking in the past.

206
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,920
And then this year, CES happened and Amazon's Echo is literally built into everything from

207
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,800
light switches to toilets, literally, microwave ovens, toaster ovens.

208
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,160
You know how we all joke about Linux running on toasters?

209
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,840
The Echo software is literally running on toasters now.

210
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,360
On user error this week, we're going to talk about a flex home that is a prefabbed home

211
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,800
that is everything built in is smart.

212
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,080
Every light, every blind, your heater, your water, everything is like one of these quote

213
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,760
unquote smart devices.

214
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,280
And the home just pre-ships with an Amazon Echo to control it all.

215
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,880
I think that ship sailed too, unfortunately.

216
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,760
Yeah, I think it is hard that they can't even just be as good as the competition.

217
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,440
They really need something to separate out.

218
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,000
And I don't think privacy is enough for a large enough audience.

219
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,600
On-premises support would be a pretty big product differentiator.

220
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
So if you could run the Mycroft service on-premises.

221
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Yeah, right.

222
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Yeah.

223
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I mean, I'm-

224
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Compatibility and patchability.

225
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
Yeah.

226
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:05,360
Part of me is so sort of bummed about it, but then part of me is like this idealistic,

227
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,360
hopeful person.

228
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,640
So the same part of me that really wants the Librem 5 to succeed, wants this to succeed.

229
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,240
All right, well, let's talk about how Didroxx is solely making me fall back in love with

230
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,040
Gnome and is helping bring rational discussion to what otherwise is just a bunch of clickbait.

231
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
Yeah, let's please.

232
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,360
So the new version of Gnome is Nye.

233
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,880
And of course, it'll be arriving in all of our favorite distributions soon.

234
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,960
And the big controversial change, which we've given some mention to, is the removal of desktop

235
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
icons.

236
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
So we're going to do a smattering of Gnome news here.

237
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,640
And we'll start with this, a smattering.

238
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,840
We did some smattering of plasma news last week.

239
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Now it's a smattering of Gnome news this week.

240
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:51,800
So in 1804, you've probably heard by now that Canonical has made the choice to ship an older

241
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,600
version of Nautilus in their 1804 desktop.

242
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,440
The number one comment I've seen is, and I quote, oh, here we go again.

243
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,480
I can't even believe how many times I've seen.

244
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,600
Oh, here we go again.

245
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,720
Here goes Canonical, crazy ass Canonical, not happy with the upstream Gnome arrogance.

246
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,980
And so they're running off and forking their Gnome desktop all over again.

247
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:27,680
This has been the common response to the announcement that Canonical would simply be shipping one

248
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,160
version behind of the file manager.

249
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
So what's going on here?

250
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
Why is Gnome dropping icons?

251
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,560
Is it because they hate users?

252
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,820
Or is there something else more sophisticated and complex happening?

253
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:43,640
And Didrocks just has this great post that really kind of explains it all.

254
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:52,040
And Didrocks is a great sort of nonpartisan position to cover this because he's been maintaining

255
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,440
code as part of Unity for years that dealt with this very code path.

256
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,640
So he has hands-on experience with the very feature that's being deprecated.

257
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,560
And he's the guy that for some reason, which we'll get to, is going through all the hassle

258
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,240
of backboarding the old version of files to Ubuntu.

259
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
So how did we get here?

260
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:17,880
And why is Gnome removing icons off of the desktop at the very time when Plasma is switching

261
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,320
to icons on the desktop by default?

262
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
How did we get here?

263
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
What?

264
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
What happened?

265
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,880
Well, you've got to understand the background.

266
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:34,620
There has been a lot of discussion for years about these icons on the desktop.

267
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,880
So they're not really put there by Gnome 3 Shell.

268
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,920
They're put there by the Nautilus file manager.

269
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,640
And they use this really interesting X layering to be on the bottom layer.

270
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:49,640
But it's this really weird thing that Didrocks goes into more in his blog post.

271
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,320
But it's making me shiver just right now.

272
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,600
It is one of those moments where you realize this has been kind of this hacky thing that

273
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,700
they've been dragging along for like three years that they've been trying to come up

274
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,360
with a way to kill this feature.

275
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,560
And it has been a controversial discussion for over three years.

276
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,960
And it has been also one of these features that they have been openly discussing.

277
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,360
You can find a recent blog post on Planet Gnome back in December where they sort of

278
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,680
outline their thinking on all of this and why this might be coming.

279
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,460
And on top of that, by reading this post, you discover that the Gnome folks also gave

280
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,200
a heads up to Didrocks and said, hey, we're thinking about making this change.

281
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
What do you guys think?

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,560
And it did put Canonical in a bit of an awkward position because they kind of were left with

283
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,680
three sort of mediocre choices.

284
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,400
They could stick with Nautilus 3.26, the current version, and keep icon support.

285
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:55,440
They could ship Nautilus 328 and also ship Nemo desktop to support desktop icons.

286
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,080
But then they're shipping one file manager and part of Nemo, which is a fork of that

287
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,660
file manager.

288
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:07,400
Or they could ship Nautilus 328 and use a brand new extension that's in the works to

289
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,060
draw the icons on the desktop.

290
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,280
The issue there being that the mechanism that that extension uses isn't even finalized

291
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,160
in GTK yet.

292
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
And it hasn't been tested.

293
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,560
Ooh, on an LTS.

294
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,200
And Canonical shipping an LTS.

295
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Exactly.

296
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,520
So they're in a position where we've got to ship an LTS.

297
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,600
We want to do the most rational thing.

298
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,920
And we don't want to remove icons on the desktop that's going to be around for five years.

299
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:36,240
And so when you stack all the bad choices up, the best choice is to just ship Nautilus

300
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,040
3.26.

301
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,720
And that was also the suggestion of the GNOME project.

302
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Is that right?

303
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Which is an interesting point.

304
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,520
And to that end, didrocks includes sort of like a sub blog from one of the GNOME developers

305
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,680
explaining the rationale on this.

306
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,040
And anytime you can kind of reduce variabilities, then it's easier to test those code paths.

307
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,960
It's easier to ensure reliability.

308
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,920
And whenever you start forking big things, like say they were bringing on Nautilus 328

309
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,440
and also that GNOME Shell extension, those are all new things that they would have to

310
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,480
be testing against, which would probably not be a good idea for the LTS.

311
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,560
But I guess the long term answer, if you want icons, is this extension that they're working

312
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,560
on.

313
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,560
So there's hope yet for you desktop lovers out there.

314
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,920
I guess.

315
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,760
The whole post is a fascinating read because didrocks goes into how he got this working

316
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:34,000
on Unity over the years and some of the little tricks that he did to position the icons correctly

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,800
to sort of sense where they should be.

318
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,960
And you really, reading it between the lines, the message I get is, man, X11 is just a big

319
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
cluster.

320
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
I hate touching this.

321
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
It's really a mess.

322
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,380
And then it's like, oh, yeah, that's why we got to go to Wayland.

323
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,600
Some of the stuff you read, you go, oh, geez, God, that's, yeah, get rid of the icons.

324
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,560
I can't believe they're doing that hack to show my icons on the desktop.

325
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,600
Oh, and by the way, this code path hasn't been maintained for, I mean, it's been maintained,

326
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,520
but it really hasn't been modified for like three years.

327
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,000
It's just time to go.

328
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,080
And you know what?

329
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,480
I got to say this post by didrocks changed my position on this.

330
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,040
I was a little skeptical, like, oh, really guys?

331
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,520
You just, it's like you just constantly are shooting down work.

332
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,240
But then going through this, it's like, oh, they just, why was it implemented via Nautilus

333
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
in the first place?

334
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,080
Why isn't just a fundamental function of gnome shell?

335
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:29,880
And that because Nautilus was the shell, you know, previously in gnome 2, Nautilus was

336
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,760
the shell in the same way that today in Marte, Kaja is the shell.

337
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,600
And Kaja has the option to.

338
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Go ahead Kaja.

339
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,200
It's far more useful where it would be.

340
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,640
So what do you say?

341
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,800
So heavens, your argument is, is yeah, but now Nautilus is less useful and Kaja and Nemo

342
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
are more useful.

343
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,840
Well, when you're running a program, what screen space is being used, it kind of overwrites

344
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
the desktop.

345
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,680
The dock can only slide out and be visible whenever you want it to be or always visible.

346
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,360
That's more persistent than a desktop icon.

347
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,880
Yeah, fair enough.

348
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,600
Wimpy sitting there with a Mate desktop in front of you right now.

349
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,280
What are your thoughts on this on this fundamental discussion of the code path to maintain desktop

350
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,800
icons is antiquated.

351
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,440
It's not maintained, it's sort of been a hack for a long time, and it's an X11 hack on top

352
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,440
of that.

353
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,440
But yet it's a feature users want who I'd be curious to know what your thinking is on

354
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
this.

355
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,760
Yeah, I mean, I'd agree with all of the comments about it being, you know, legacy code and

356
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
what have you.

357
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,760
We've, we've really struggled to maintain all of the desktop interaction features that

358
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,880
exist within Mate and Kaja as we've migrated to GTK 3.

359
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,480
And it's hard work, and there are things that could be improved, and that's even harder

360
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,120
to resolve.

361
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,360
I think one of the fallouts of this is that longer term, you know, these APIs to do this

362
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,400
are deprecated now, and they're going to be going away in GTK 4.

363
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,040
So the likes of the Mate desktop and XFCE and the others that are doing the traditional

364
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,720
desktop metaphor, because after all, you can't call it a desktop if it doesn't have any icons

365
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,280
on it anymore, because the metaphor is broken at that point.

366
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,080
So it's just, you know, a shell, you know, you can't claim it a desktop because it isn't.

367
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,160
But one of the things we've been discussing in the Mate project is perhaps we need to

368
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:37,000
create a library lib desktop, which is a whole cloth implementation in order to broker this

369
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,880
kind of, you know, interaction if that's the route that we decide to go.

370
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,600
Whilst we're on GTK 3, we can stay the course with the improvements that we've made.

371
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,320
But when GTK 4 comes along, we'll have to review, you know, what our plans are.

372
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
Wow.

373
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Wow.

374
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,600
Wow, that is a lot for me to take in.

375
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,720
So the possibility of having to implement your own desktop, something that feels like

376
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,240
it should be a first class baked in citizen of the core desktop experience, if that's

377
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,120
something you want, that's a really, that's a tough road to hoe.

378
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:20,000
And I have to say, on systems where I have desktop icons, I just make a mess.

379
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,560
I just make a mess.

380
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,800
Yeah, I don't have any systems that have them anymore.

381
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Really?

382
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,240
And then systems where I don't have them, I just make a folder structure that's also

383
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
been a mess.

384
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,160
But it's a folder structure within my home directory.

385
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:38,360
I just, it's weird because I'm working on this project where most of our users are really

386
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,560
interested in keeping that desktop.

387
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,760
You know, if you look at a lot of Marte users desktop, it's just full of icons.

388
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Now I've never done that.

389
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,840
I have a directory I create in my home directory called cruft and anything transient just ends

390
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,880
up in there and periodically I have to go through and sort it out.

391
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,840
A lot of people use their desktop as that space for cruft.

392
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,760
So personally, I wouldn't miss icons on the desktop because that isn't part of my workflow.

393
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:15,120
The problem is, is we have to be mindful of the workflow of all of our users and a significant

394
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,960
number of them value that feature because it's in their muscle memory.

395
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,000
That's how they've been doing it for years and years.

396
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You know, my mom, who is a graphic artist on the computer, she very much uses the drag

397
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
and drop paradigm.

398
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,920
So she'll drag an image from an application to the desktop and from her desktop to another

399
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
application.

400
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,960
And the desktop is sort of like this intermediary holding bin where she can then drag it to

401
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
another icon on her dock.

402
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,240
I mean, it seems like for some users, the desktop is how they interface with the computer,

403
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
right?

404
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
That's how they conceptualize it.

405
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
Right.

406
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
To not have icons that they have on the other platforms.

407
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
Yeah.

408
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Yeah.

409
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
Yeah.

410
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,000
And then for me, it's like, I'll use it if I have it and it's always a mess.

411
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,800
And then I, if I don't have it, I just make, I make like a cruft folder like Wimpy does.

412
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,440
Although I don't have such a clever name for it.

413
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,600
I'm going to, I'm going to start using that.

414
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,800
I'm going to steal that.

415
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,040
Speaking of stealing, Gnome Photos is stealing a few features from Darktable and I'm all

416
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
about it.

417
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I think this is a great idea.

418
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,400
Talk about a nice open source Kumbaya.

419
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,520
This is not a huge story, but Gnome Photos in the next version is getting nice.

420
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,480
And while we're talking about new Gnome stuff, why not?

421
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,160
They're implementing shadows and highlights from Darktable into Gnome Photos.

422
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
Oh, that's awesome.

423
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Isn't that great?

424
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Yeah.

425
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,220
It's just a super, super great idea.

426
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,240
New crop features, new scaling features, new easy way to kind of get like a grid on there

427
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,500
when you're trying to get a nice photo.

428
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,840
Basically what I'm telling you is if you just need a nice program to sort photos and make

429
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,440
them a little bit better, maybe increase exposure, contrast, highlights, and crop them a little

430
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,300
bit, you know, that you shot on your phone, this is it.

431
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,300
It's getting there now.

432
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,440
And Gnome Photos is making steady progress.

433
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,520
So I'm excited to see that progress.

434
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,640
It's really kind of getting to that point where I don't need much more than a file manager.

435
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,960
So this is just about it.

436
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,440
Those final touches, you know, before I consider it done.

437
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:01,800
And then last but not least, while we're in the Gnome news segment, Firefox is, so 58

438
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
is next.

439
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,760
Firefox 58 will be out on tomorrow if all goes as planned, I think.

440
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
Yeah.

441
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
No, today even.

442
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
Is it out today?

443
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,760
I can't remember if it's out today or tomorrow.

444
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,680
Looks like they're planning to put it in the release channel today.

445
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Okay.

446
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Yeah.

447
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,680
Okay.

448
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,680
So it's coming out.

449
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,680
Yeah.

450
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
So new version of Firefox is coming out.

451
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,280
Now that's not specifically Gnome, but I guess while we're talking about it, I'll tell you

452
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,320
what's new is a whole new way of handling user profiles, which means it's going to do

453
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,320
a user profile migration and it will, your user profile will not be compatible with older

454
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,920
versions of Firefox.

455
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:39,160
So heads up if you use portable Firefox or somebody get on the phone with Joe Ressington.

456
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,420
There's also the improvements to the web extensions API and they're making some claims with hard

457
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,380
numbers about performance.

458
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:52,800
They say they have improved off main thread painting in Firefox and that the rendering

459
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:59,760
time is improved noticeably, 30% improvement for Firefox 58 when compared to Firefox 57

460
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,760
and JavaScript bytecode cache is reduced by quite a bit from like having to start when

461
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,960
you start navigation to the when the event is fired via JavaScript, there has been on

462
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,140
average a 43 millisecond reduction.

463
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,960
They're actually giving out a hard number there, 43 millisecond reduction in Firefox

464
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,800
58 as well as improvements to the screenshotting tool, which I've actually begun using a bit

465
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,900
more.

466
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,120
Some fixes for audio playback on those windows desktops, not familiar with that, that sounds

467
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,120
like something that's in my house and as well as other nice things.

468
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,880
But that's Firefox 58, which comes out like about now.

469
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
That's interesting.

470
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Hit download right now.

471
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,880
58 go get it.

472
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Really?

473
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Yeah.

474
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
Go get it guys.

475
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Everybody go.

476
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
I'm getting it right now.

477
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
But that isn't Gnome related.

478
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
What is Gnome related?

479
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,480
It's Firefox 59.

480
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,000
Always looking at the next version, aren't we?

481
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
We're always looking.

482
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Oh yeah.

483
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And if you follow the bug tracker, it looks like all of the blocking bugs to convert Firefox

484
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,360
to GTK 3 and GTK 3 only have been cleared.

485
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,640
All of the blocking bugs have been cleared.

486
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,540
And with that marked now as resolved, the migration to move Firefox to GTK 3 has been

487
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,440
marked as completed.

488
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:15,240
And if all lines up, Firefox 59 will be the first version of Firefox that is solely 100%

489
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:21,880
GTK 3, which I believe leaves GIMP as the last Gnome application, the major Gnome application,

490
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,600
big Gnome application that has not moved to GTK 3.

491
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,800
Ironic considering that GIMP is the father of the GTK toolkit.

492
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Right?

493
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
It is, isn't it?

494
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
It is.

495
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,160
But it also strikes me as if you're a Linux user, Firefox is currently catering to you

496
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
right now.

497
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,480
Both 58 and 59 have a lot of nice improvements that are specific to Linux users.

498
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,120
It's never been a better time to be a Firefox user.

499
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,400
I'm really looking forward to these new profiles.

500
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,320
I'm hoping that that could be...

501
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,880
It's really difficult to get unwedded from the profiles in Chrome and Chromium, and I'm

502
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,680
hoping that this is gonna be it.

503
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
Yeah.

504
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
I hope so too.

505
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,000
I am waiting with anticipation.

506
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,200
I'm all in now on Firefox.

507
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,280
The computer I'm sitting at right now is my last computer using Chrome.

508
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,840
And I think it's just mostly because of workflow on air, but that could even get changed soon

509
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
too.

510
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
That's just so great.

511
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,800
It's so great and it's so nice to have them, at least to me...

512
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Firefox reticules.

513
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Yeah.

514
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,920
It feels like they're back in a way and that they're focusing on Linux users and GTK 3

515
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,840
means we're probably gonna see all kinds of cool stuff.

516
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,880
It's also just nice to have some more, I mean, we're in an era kind of right now with that

517
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,780
and with Brave and other browsers that there's a lot more competition going on and hopefully

518
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,780
that's good for us.

519
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,780
Mm-hmm.

520
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,780
It does seem to be.

521
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,780
It does seem to be.

522
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,440
Speaking of competition, Ting is bringing the competition to the mobile market in a

523
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,060
huge, huge way.

524
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,280
It's just pay for what you use wireless.

525
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
That's...

526
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,400
Oh, man.

527
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
That would just totally...

528
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,200
If the wireless industry had to restart today, had to restart right now, say right this moment,

529
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,920
Ting would run the table.

530
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,380
You just pay for what you use, a fair price for how much you talk, text and data you use.

531
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,920
And it's just $6 for your line.

532
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,120
You want one line, it's $6.

533
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
You want two lines, it's $12.

534
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,240
You see what I'm saying here?

535
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,200
Uncle Sam takes his tax, you know, in your local area like he do, Wes.

536
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
We sure do.

537
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
He do.

538
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
He takes that cut.

539
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,880
But then you just pay for what you use, nationwide coverage, no contracts, no quote-unquote agreements,

540
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,440
and a dashboard for days.

541
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,760
One of my favorite things about Ting is their GSM and CDMA network.

542
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,840
Why do I like that?

543
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,320
Because when I'm traveling, I pick whichever one works better for me.

544
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,400
And even realistically, in different spots in Washington, there's just sometimes I'm

545
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,460
in a terrain with the trees and the hills where CDMA works better.

546
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,280
And sometimes I'm in a place where GSM just totally rocks.

547
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,120
Like here at the studio, I'm always on the GSM network.

548
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,280
And I love the flexibility because I have a couple of different MiFi devices, and at

549
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,720
just $6 a month, it's no big deal if I don't use Ting that much that month on that particular

550
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
MiFi.

551
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,200
That's a really flexible way to work.

552
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,700
Plus, during Linux Fest Northwest, we'll spin up an extra couple of lines, hand out some

553
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,100
cheapo phones, and stay in contact.

554
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,800
It's great for small businesses.

555
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,040
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

556
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,880
Linux.ting.com is where you go.

557
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
Linux.ting.com.

558
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:13,880
Go there, take $25 off a phone, or bring a device and get $25 in service credit.

559
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,960
Linux.ting.com.

560
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,680
So I'm a big fan of different launchers.

561
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,640
I've tried Synapse throughout the years.

562
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,280
I've tried Noom Do.

563
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,280
I've been using the launcher built into Unity quite a bit.

564
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:33,040
Wimpy was recently talking to me about some different launchers on Mate with Brisk, got

565
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,600
my interest peaked there.

566
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,760
So I just wanted to give a shout out to an application launcher for Linux that I've come

567
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,640
across recently that's scratching that itch.

568
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,880
It's fast.

569
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,040
It works sort of like all typical launchers do work.

570
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
It's pretty quick.

571
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,720
It supports fuzzy search.

572
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,200
It has shortcuts and different extensions that you can load.

573
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,840
It can also browse directories, which is pretty nice for me because I have scripts in a bin

574
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,520
directory, in my home directory, so I can do tilde slash bin in the name of the script

575
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,960
and it just executes it.

576
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,480
It does, you know, like rough math in the launcher.

577
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
It's great.

578
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
It's called...

579
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
It's even got emoji support.

580
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
Look at that.

581
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,480
I know.

582
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
That's how you know it's modern, right?

583
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,160
It's called uLauncher at uLauncher.io.

584
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,200
And it's wonderful.

585
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
It's great.

586
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
It's fast.

587
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,680
And it loads pretty easily.

588
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,000
And once you put it on your system, you can use that to start up all the damn applications.

589
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,400
They got an AUR available.

590
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,000
They got a Fedora package available.

591
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,080
They got a SUSE package available.

592
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,040
And they got a PPA for Ubuntu, which is pretty great.

593
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
And the project's...

594
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
It's kind of new.

595
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040
It's up on Patreon.

596
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,120
They're taking that as well as Bitcoin, but they also have the extension plugin, which

597
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
is great.

598
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,300
So you can, speaking of Bitcoin, have a Bitcoin plugin type BTC in the launcher and it comes

599
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:48,400
back with the price or can do Bitcoin conversions for you in your launcher.

600
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,240
Welcome to 2018, right?

601
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,560
There's a key pass plugin.

602
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Really?

603
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Mm-hmm.

604
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
I'll just say that.

605
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
There's a key pass plugin.

606
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
There's an open in browser.

607
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:01,360
So you can say hgoogle.com and it'll launch in the right browser.

608
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,600
It'll support your Chrome bookmarks or your Firefox bookmark.

609
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
It supports logging out of the desktop if you want.

610
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,560
So they got some specific extensions for Cinnamon.

611
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,040
And one thing that's actually pretty handy that I think I'm gonna load this on my lady's

612
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,680
computer for is it has a timer built in, which she uses a lot for work.

613
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,860
Like, set a timer for 15 minutes.

614
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,860
That's great.

615
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,240
And it's just built right in the launcher, I mean, once you install the extension.

616
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,440
So anyways, this is one of my favorite finds recently.

617
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,240
I don't think we've talked about it before.

618
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
Boy is it great.

619
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,160
uLauncher.io and it's probably in your local repo right there.

620
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,360
Wimpy, did you want to give any mention for the Brisk launcher stuff that you and I were

621
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,680
chatting about recently off air?

622
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,440
Yeah, sure.

623
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,920
So there is a new feature coming in the next version of Brisk menu, which enables you to

624
00:30:51,920 --> 00:31:00,360
change the way that it's displayed to present a dash style launcher rather than the pop

625
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,960
down menu.

626
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:09,520
So we're running a patched version of that in our dev branch for Ubuntu Mate at the moment.

627
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:16,200
And when you enable the mutiny layout now on Ubuntu Mate 1804, it tweaks the various

628
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,360
magic settings.

629
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:24,760
So then when you hit the super key, you get this dash, which is full screen, large icons,

630
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:30,940
text search, category buttons to touch, and the whole thing is touch capable.

631
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:37,600
So that will be landing in Ubuntu Mate 1804, which is good because it's one of those little

632
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,480
details that I knew we would get to and I knew everyone would point out was missing

633
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,160
in 17.10 and they did.

634
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,720
Now it's in there for the 1804.

635
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
That's great.

636
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
Yeah, it's getting there.

637
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
Yeah.

638
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Got one bug to fix and then that's good to go.

639
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,040
I love Brisk as it's a great project.

640
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,360
So really cool to see that.

641
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Yeah.

642
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,520
And that was another great collaboration, you know, with the Brisk team.

643
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:05,420
There's a developer in Solus called Stefan and we offered a bounty for the work and he

644
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,760
did the work and Ubuntu Mate funded it.

645
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,320
So that's really great.

646
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
That is.

647
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,280
So there's this next application I wanted to feature today.

648
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,280
Wes found it.

649
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,360
He almost sat on it just to talk about it exclusively in the new TechSnap program because

650
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,480
that's where all our best stuff is now.

651
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,480
I'm kidding.

652
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,920
But I did really enjoy last week's episode.

653
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,920
That was good.

654
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,080
Wes gave us an introduction to configuration management.

655
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,960
And this application is an advanced user interface to manage...

656
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,880
It's like a dashboard really.

657
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
To manage...

658
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,960
You know how we love dashboards here in the Linux Unplugged program?

659
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,960
Dashboards for days.

660
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Days!

661
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,320
It's the advanced dashboard for quick managing and inspecting of containers and images for

662
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,360
Docker.

663
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,880
And it's all on the command line.

664
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,320
It's totally Ncurses based, which is the part I love about it.

665
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,360
Because like when you say dashboard, you're probably thinking like a web page.

666
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
Sure.

667
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
Ha!

668
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
Got you.

669
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
No, it is an Ncurses application.

670
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
It shows you you're running...

671
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,520
It shows you you're running Docker containers, your overall system utilization.

672
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,520
Picture it.

673
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
Sicily 1987.

674
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,120
You SSH into your server.

675
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,160
You bring this up and you have a full overview of everything that's going on.

676
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,680
I can't tell you how useful this is going to be for me on my DigitalOcean droplets.

677
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Yeah.

678
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,480
It seems like something that will find its way to Tmux session near me.

679
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Exactly.

680
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,840
It's exactly what I'm going to do with it.

681
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:32,200
And I have been experimenting with different click and run type setups for Docker.

682
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,480
Just totally like...

683
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
I forget what the...

684
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,360
I covered it in Coder Radio months ago, but there is an application...

685
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,800
I think I might've talked about it in this show too, that will search the Docker directory,

686
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,400
pull it down, set it all up, and you just click that one thing.

687
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,560
Oh yeah.

688
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,080
This is sort of more like inspecting the existing Docker stuff that you have set up.

689
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,480
It doesn't quite do that part of it.

690
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,600
But it's...

691
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,880
I don't know.

692
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,560
There's something broken about me about Ncurses user interfaces.

693
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:05,320
When they're done right, I will take an Ncurses user interface in my terminal over a really

694
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,200
well done graphical interface any day of the week.

695
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,200
Same.

696
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Yeah.

697
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,520
Even if I'm on graphical desktop, I'll just run it in a terminal window.

698
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,480
I just prefer the flexibility.

699
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,920
I can reshape them to the size I want.

700
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,680
There's lots of context switching too.

701
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,560
Even though I have a web browser open, I have to go shift my attention.

702
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,200
And then this last one here for this week is something that the beard slotted in at

703
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,560
the last minute.

704
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,480
It's the new version of OBS Studio, OBS Studios, I like to say.

705
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,760
version 21 is out and it's huge.

706
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,160
It is...

707
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:49,080
If I was Telestream and I was making the Wirecast product, I would be extremely nervous about

708
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,800
this little ankle biter called OBS Studio.

709
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,800
It's extremely competitive now and they've just introduced Lua and Python scripting support,

710
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,000
which the ramifications of that are going to be huge because you can set up control

711
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,240
devices and you're going to be able to set off entire actions now with this.

712
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,600
And the fact that they're supporting both Lua and Python is pretty great.

713
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,600
They've included some examples like countdowns and all this kind of stuff.

714
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,120
But in the background now, they're getting to the point where they're adding really high

715
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:28,840
end professional, like I used to pay $2,000 to get access to these kinds of features.

716
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,580
They're adding 7.1 surround sound support.

717
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,800
They're adding higher bit rate support.

718
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,720
They've revamped the audio meters so that way they break out individual sources and

719
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
microphones.

720
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,120
They're also supporting microphone multi-sources.

721
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,520
It's really professional grade.

722
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
What do you think, Beard?

723
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,840
Is there one feature on this list that we really need to have?

724
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:55,320
It's almost to be worth the hassle of upgrading the Archbox?

725
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:01,000
I think that you would mostly like the side chain ducking.

726
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Oh yeah?

727
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Yeah.

728
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,240
That basically allows you to automatically lower the level of one input based on the

729
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,800
level of another input.

730
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,800
Yeah.

731
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,280
And you can see how that would be useful for like audio clips or maybe even the Mumble

732
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Room.

733
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,280
That's how they do it in radio, right?

734
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,560
The caller automatically gets ducked when the host starts speaking.

735
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
It's nice.

736
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,840
I had been staring at the OBS interface now for a year because it's how we record all

737
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,080
our shows and how we live stream.

738
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,120
So this is a really critical piece of software for us.

739
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,920
And I've been wondering how they're going to improve the audio meter interface.

740
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,040
I don't know if I love this, but it's better than what I expected.

741
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,860
Here's the feature I'm actually the most interested in.

742
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,520
The preview mode now.

743
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:54,600
So in the studio, we have a dedicated 1080p monitor that is just a preview output from

744
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
OBS.

745
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
Wes and I look at it all the time.

746
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
All the time.

747
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,000
It shows us whatever's on the live stream on a dedicated monitor.

748
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,800
It's extremely useful.

749
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,320
Yes, absolutely.

750
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,560
And now they're adding the ability to have eight scenes on that screen ahead of time.

751
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:15,720
So I can have all of the shots, like a director's room, all of the shots on that screen.

752
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,400
And then I know which one to go to.

753
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,680
Well, you and I have some ideas about where to take this show post 250 that involve multi

754
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,040
camera setups and you'd be on camera, I'd have a camera, we'd have a screen camera.

755
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,200
They're adding the very features we might just need to take the show to the next level.

756
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,800
Multi-track recording, multi-camera preview.

757
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,860
This is the kind of thing where this free open source project is coming along and adding

758
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:46,560
stuff that costs tens of thousands of dollars all told, and they're just doing it for free.

759
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,720
And at the same time, we have these ambitions and goals where we want to go with the network

760
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,760
and with the show specifically, and it's just lining up perfectly.

761
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,440
So it's pretty exciting.

762
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,320
There's other things that I really appreciate in here, and I hope I'm not going too far

763
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:03,000
off in the weeds, but having managed these systems for like a decade, there's like a

764
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
couple-

765
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
It's pretty important to day-to-day operations.

766
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,540
There's just like a few little things too that have bugged me for so long.

767
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,120
Per scene transition overrides, which allow you to select a specific transition to use

768
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,680
for a specific scene.

769
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,280
Sometimes I want a slow fade, sometimes I want a hard cut.

770
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,200
That sounds like a small thing, but when I want it, I really want it and I want it how

771
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,240
I want it because it's really important.

772
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,080
If I'm transitioning to like our standby screen, I like a nice slow fade out.

773
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,360
If I'm transitioning from this to our chat room, I want a quicker fade, and it actually

774
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,600
kind of bothers me right now.

775
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,800
I can't quite get what I want.

776
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,160
It's not quite there.

777
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,640
It's driven me crazy, and they're fixing that.

778
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,800
They've also bumped up the developer documentation, made some fixes for those of you that are

779
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,760
stuck on Windows and Mac OS, like now they're using a dark theme.

780
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,680
I didn't realize that Mac and Windows users didn't have a dark theme because if we're

781
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,840
using a GTK, everything's dark and we have everything set to dark on our GNOME desktop,

782
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,840
so it's always been dark.

783
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
Oh, no, no.

784
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
They already had a dark theme.

785
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,540
They just added a new theme in addition to that one.

786
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,920
And now it's default, right?

787
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,160
And they've also changed the default too, which I just didn't realize that OBS had themes

788
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,840
because it's always just matched whatever my GTK theme is.

789
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,160
There's also one small like little audio bug fix for audio monitoring on Linux and some

790
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:23,000
fixes for AMD users with AMD GPUs.

791
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Go ahead.

792
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Oh, just one last thing.

793
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
They've reduced that.

794
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,720
I was telling you about the preview pane, the 8 preview pane.

795
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,160
They've reduced the CPU usage by about 8% on that, which is pretty significant.

796
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,920
Anyways, Barret, go ahead.

797
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,400
I think you're actually going to love the new audio meters.

798
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,600
This is probably the best implementation of an audio meter I've seen in any program ever.

799
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,880
Yeah, it is nice, and they have different options for like monitoring the peaks and

800
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,880
keeping track of them.

801
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Yes.

802
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,320
And I would say that's an area where they've been particularly weak in the past.

803
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,360
I'm going to talk about it on User Air 43.

804
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,840
So tune into this week's User Air that will come out later in this week.

805
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,760
I have a new podcast studio I'm building, and it's going to be tighter, and it's going

806
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,020
to be more confined than ever.

807
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,680
And so the fact that OBS is doing more might make it a good candidate for that setup, and

808
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,500
I'll talk about that in the near future.

809
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,160
But that's a good batch of open source updates this week.

810
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:21,760
A really solid launcher, a great update on OBS, the Mate desktop is getting better than

811
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
ever.

812
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,280
Wimpy, are you up for talking a little more about some of the things in Mate, some of

813
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
the other things we talked about?

814
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
Yep.

815
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Can do that.

816
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
All right.

817
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
Hold on to that.

818
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,280
We'll do that soon.

819
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:38,040
There's some other really good stuff coming, as well as 20 years of LWN and why I really

820
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,460
believe they're doing journalism right.

821
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,160
And then we got to talk about that application problem.

822
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
Everything's Electron.

823
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,320
It's all Electron these days, and we've talked about that before.

824
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,520
But there's another shift.

825
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:53,840
And darn if Joey over at OMG Ubuntu didn't just put it into perfect terms.

826
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,320
So we'll talk about that as well.

827
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Lots more to come up.

828
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,720
So let's take a moment and thank DigitalOcean for sponsoring this week's episode of the

829
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,720
Unplugged program.

830
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,200
Go to DigitalOcean, create an account, start up, and then use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

831
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:10,480
Deploy entire application stacks or just machines in less than 55 seconds.

832
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,880
Everything is SSD-based.

833
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,360
If you're doing something that's $5 a month all the way up to the systems that have hundreds

834
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:20,840
of gigs of RAM and lots of CPU and tons of transfer, they're all secure and reliable.

835
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:26,760
They have built-in, baked-in monitoring and metrics right into the system.

836
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,720
They've got load balancing as a service.

837
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,760
And then you'll also notice, and sometimes it's not even self-evident, but you'll also

838
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,240
notice like firewall features.

839
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,880
Oh, that seems like a good idea, except for their DigitalOcean firewalls, their quote-unquote

840
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,200
cloud firewalls.

841
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,700
What makes it a cloud firewall?

842
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,480
You don't have to touch IP tables.

843
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,760
It's at the network level, too.

844
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,760
Yeah, also that part.

845
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
Both of those things.

846
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,760
That's not what I'm excited about.

847
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,340
No kidding, right?

848
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,280
There's two different things there that are really great.

849
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,160
They're both true.

850
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,000
They set it up at the network level so it never even hits the machine.

851
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
That's the number one thing I like.

852
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,700
And the number two thing is you don't got to screw around with IP tables.

853
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,720
You can deploy an entire stack or just the base system.

854
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,840
We were just recently playing around with a new way to do VoIP communications where

855
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,640
you have this one central server that sort of proxies the connection.

856
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,280
And once the connections are set up, it's a WebRTC direct point-to-point.

857
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,160
I didn't need a very fast server.

858
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:25,240
So in about a minute, I spun up the $5 a month droplet, which with their new pricing is better

859
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,400
than ever.

860
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,360
And if you use our promo code, you could try it out two months for free.

861
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,960
I was able to try it out, see if this thing worked right, and then I destroyed the droplet

862
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,300
10 minutes later.

863
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,600
This kind of flexible aspect of DigitalOcean means that sometimes I use a machine for half

864
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,920
a day, and sometimes a machine has been in production for four years.

865
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,240
My oldest box is an Arch machine on DigitalOcean that's over four years old, and I still use

866
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,320
it to this day.

867
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,240
They have great reliability, great performance, and great pricing.

868
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,760
Go to DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, get started, create your account,

869
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,000
and see what's possible.

870
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,920
And then when you're ready to go to the next level, they have fantastic documentation,

871
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:09,880
a straightforward API, and lots of open source code built around the DigitalOcean infrastructure.

872
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,480
DigitalOcean.com, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the show, and thanks to you

873
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:17,120
guys for continuing to use that promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

874
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:23,800
It keeps this show going, and by goodness, we may just make it to episode 250, and maybe

875
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,200
even 300, because you guys keep supporting our sponsors.

876
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,360
DigitalOcean.com, promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

877
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:36,780
You know, Wimpy, I was looking back at the Linux Unplugged Archive, and if you fast forward

878
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:41,680
just a couple of weeks, it was almost a year ago that you and I were talking about you

879
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:48,160
loading up Ubuntu Mate on your XPS 15 and getting high DPI support.

880
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,800
In fact, I even found the post that I used during the show to show on the live stream

881
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,800
while you and I were talking about this.

882
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:58,600
So the fact that today you and I were having a conversation where even more is happening

883
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:03,800
really shows how you've been like a dog with a bone on this particular issue.

884
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:12,520
Yes, although I have little credit to claim in this story, but the news is today we've

885
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:20,560
landed the last of the patches to fully implement high DPI support in the Maltay desktop.

886
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,560
And yeah, I've been-

887
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,560
Thank you, God.

888
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:30,360
I'm sorry to interrupt you, Wimpy, but I have been trying like crazy to get Maltay working

889
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,800
on a Macbook 15 inch from 2013.

890
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,240
It is a high DPI display as well, and I swear I am so thankful for you guys to do that because

891
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:45,400
I got to tell you, I have been wanting to try out Mate on my Mac, and I got to be honest,

892
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,480
OS X is just killing me to the core.

893
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,940
With the DPI support, yeah.

894
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,940
It's just way better.

895
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:56,600
I mean, every desktop I've tried, XFC, Stock Gnome, everything, it was just a freaking

896
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,600
nightmare.

897
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,400
Maltay got close, and I tried it on a few, and it definitely was usable, but it felt

898
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,000
like there was a pretty big gap.

899
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:11,480
Yes, the screen size, yeah, because I tell you, the Mac has a beautiful right now display,

900
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,560
but Mac OS is just going to be a pitter because I hate it, and I have wanted to just dump

901
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:22,920
this thing for months, but I couldn't find the right desktop to do it for Linux, and

902
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:30,080
I love Mate, I love Gnome 2's interface, but Maltay being more modern, and I would love

903
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,620
to run Mate on a Mac, but hopefully this will fix that niche.

904
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,960
So what's going on, Moby?

905
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,200
So the changes that have landed are to really smooth those rough edges that you would have

906
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
seen.

907
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:50,560
I put some patches in about four or five months ago that kind of helped make it work a little

908
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,800
bit better, but frankly, it wasn't finished.

909
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,200
But there's a guy in the community, Victor, his name is, we found him through Solus.

910
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:06,920
He actually did the work on the super key and modify key capabilities in Maltay and

911
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:11,640
Brisk and a bunch of other places that made all of that super key and HUD stuff work,

912
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,900
you know, that you can use those keys as actions now.

913
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,160
And I approached him a little while ago and said, did he fancy, you know, tackling the

914
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,440
last of the issues with high DPI?

915
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:30,600
And he dumped a load of patches last night, and I've been testing them this evening, and

916
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,920
we are dangerously, dangerously close now to having a really good implementation of

917
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,920
high DPI.

918
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:41,960
So now that, so that I fully understand, I mean, what was missing from the high DPI support

919
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,760
as it stands now?

920
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,120
So previously, for example, the panel, you know, the little panels at the top and the

921
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:53,840
side, I got those so they actually fitted to the screen, but we were having to force

922
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:59,640
those to use one to one scaling to actually appear on the screen in the right place, which

923
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:04,120
meant that they appeared in the right place and the things that were in them were rendered

924
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:10,800
correctly, but if you right clicked on the context menus, they were all absolutely minuscule.

925
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,760
And the same was true for the window manager, and a bunch of other places where things just

926
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,400
weren't right.

927
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,800
And things like when you sized the panels, when you change the size, before that was

928
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,980
literally happening one pixel at a time, and although you're going up in increments that

929
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:32,800
look like you're adjusting it to 23, 24, 25 pixels behind the scenes, maths is happening,

930
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,720
and it's actually adjusting that scale for the high DPI screen.

931
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:42,200
So the big changes is that before you used to have to go and configure a bunch of different

932
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,920
things in about seven different places in order to enable this, and it wasn't quite

933
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,920
right.

934
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,500
Now, there's a single option, it's in Marte tweak, it's under high DPI, enable high DPI,

935
00:47:54,500 --> 00:48:01,160
you tick that box, you log out, log in, and everything is then high DPI enabled.

936
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,760
Well shoot, that is a big improvement.

937
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,880
It sure is.

938
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,200
That's no small thing there.

939
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,080
What does it look like from a user standpoint?

940
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,280
What am I going to do now to get this?

941
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:23,780
Well from Ubuntu Marte's point of view, this is going to be in 1804, and I'm hoping we

942
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:29,400
may be able to squeeze a preview in for Alpha 2.

943
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,960
There may be a couple of rough edges there, but it's very, very close now, but hopefully

944
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,360
get that in for Alpha 2.

945
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:44,480
For Marte itself, Marte desktop, we're very close to releasing Marte 1.20, and I'm trying

946
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:51,400
to work as fast as possible in the evenings to test and figure out where the remaining

947
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:57,520
issues are on this to try and land this in time for Marte 1.20, so that it's actually

948
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,120
a feature of Marte 1.20.

949
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,280
That would be wonderful.

950
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:06,680
So I guess the part I'm still not totally clear on is, so if I go into Marte Tweak and

951
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:14,680
I turn this on, am I at that same time also switching out from Marco?

952
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,080
Is that not an issue as well with high DPI support?

953
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,760
Right, so at the moment that is happening, yes.

954
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:28,400
So at the moment when you enable high DPI, it also turns on Compiz as the window manager.

955
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,960
So that's where we get the scaling of the window controls from, because we haven't actually

956
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,680
done that work in Marco yet.

957
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,680
But Compiz has.

958
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,680
Compiz has done that work.

959
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,660
But Compiz has done that for a long, long time.

960
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:45,120
So we can cut some corners in Ubuntu Marte by utilizing Compiz, and that's a fair assumption

961
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:51,360
because the set of people that have UHD displays and a computer not capable of running Compiz

962
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,360
is zero.

963
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,360
Yeah.

964
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,360
No kidding.

965
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,360
No kidding.

966
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,400
It actually would be something I would almost want to turn on anyways if I was using it.

967
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,640
So this is really, really close.

968
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:07,480
But I know from our discussion, it seems like the piece that might still be missing is auto

969
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,680
detection of the high DPI display.

970
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,600
That's still a tougher nut to crack.

971
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,880
It's not a tough nut to crack.

972
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:21,200
It's just like choosing your battles, and we've decided to just get the thing working,

973
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:27,220
and then we can revisit how that's handled in terms of dynamically detecting that you

974
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,580
are on a high DPI display.

975
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,840
It's halfway there.

976
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:36,540
The Greta determines if you're on a high DPI display and auto scales.

977
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:40,940
Then you log in, and you get an unscaled desktop, and you have to go and press a button.

978
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:44,240
So it's not perfect, but it's way, way better than this.

979
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,560
Can I ask you a crazy question?

980
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,640
Sure.

981
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:52,520
And this is probably the wrong place to do it, but what about as sort of a front and

982
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,800
center option in the Amate welcome screen, where it says-

983
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,800
Yeah.

984
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,800
Absolutely.

985
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,800
Yeah.

986
00:50:58,800 --> 00:50:59,800
You're already thinking that?

987
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,800
Yeah, yeah.

988
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,800
Yeah.

989
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:08,480
I think we can do the detection in welcome very quickly, as in implement it very quickly,

990
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,160
and detect that and actually present that as a, we see you've got a high resolution

991
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:19,720
screen which you'd like to enable high DPI, and then have that flip switched automatically,

992
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,680
and then they can log out, log back in, so it will smooth the edges.

993
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,800
So that could be the route.

994
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,160
That could be the route you end up taking.

995
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,440
Yes, it's an option.

996
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,280
The option to actually do this dynamically is still not off the table.

997
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,180
It's all a matter of time.

998
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:38,480
We've got to choose what we can do in the time remaining, and at the moment, there are

999
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,600
some other little rough edges that are more important than one fix.

1000
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:48,840
You know, today on Marks PS15, I've been running Ubuntu Marte with scaling.

1001
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:56,120
I opened every shipped by default application widget and window, and everything is scaled,

1002
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,120
including things like Qt applications.

1003
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:03,200
So we're passing through all the necessary scaling information from our environment to

1004
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,400
the Qt application.

1005
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,360
So for example, VLC is all nicely scaled, which is a Qt application that we ship by

1006
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,360
default.

1007
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,280
And then you install Electron applications, and we push all that information through to

1008
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,280
Electron as well.

1009
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,720
So they're all scaled appropriately.

1010
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,720
Shoot.

1011
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,600
This is like full grown, all grown up, real high DPI support here.

1012
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:31,000
And those of you that are familiar with GNOME 2 or Marte will or may remember that in the

1013
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,680
appearance control panel, there was a fonts tab.

1014
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:39,300
And one of the things you could do in the fonts tab was change the DPI of the fonts.

1015
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,240
And that was like the OG, you know, high DPI option.

1016
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,200
You turn that up, yeah.

1017
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,360
So that was that was how it used to be in the good old battle days.

1018
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:53,480
Now, originally, I envisaged that we would just lose that feature and that we would do

1019
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:59,880
the font scaling, you know, bound to the integer scaling of the screen.

1020
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,920
But Victor has retained that.

1021
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:08,760
And this has a really nice side effect in that we're keeping the font scaling separated

1022
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:14,000
and it automatically adjusts the font scaling.

1023
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,960
And when that happens for GTK2 applications, which have no high DPI scaling support whatsoever,

1024
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,960
other than the font scaling, they get a font scale that is accurate to the screen.

1025
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,560
So while GTK2 applications aren't going to look great, by default, they look the best

1026
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:37,000
they can be on a high DPI display by bumping those fonts out to the right sizes.

1027
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Wow.

1028
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,440
Is any other desktop doing that?

1029
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,440
I don't know.

1030
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,840
I haven't looked that carefully because I don't know how many of them had or retained

1031
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,800
that feature to adjust the font DPI.

1032
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,760
That is great.

1033
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,680
It's going to be the premier GIMP workstation.

1034
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,680
You can get icon sets for GIMP, which are like oversized.

1035
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,360
And when they're on high DPI, it actually makes GIMP usable.

1036
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:11,360
This is so cool, Wimpy, and you know, it has to be mentioned that this was the butt of

1037
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,360
so many jokes.

1038
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,280
Oh, you're going to take that Gnome 2 thing, that old busted paradigm, which for those

1039
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:22,480
of us who loved it, like myself, was an insult because it was passing judgment on how I like

1040
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,060
to use computers.

1041
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:28,360
Somebody was telling me, a lot of somebodies were telling me, that the way I like to use

1042
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:33,660
computers was old, and it was part of a bygone era, and that the future was touch, the future

1043
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:39,120
was mobile, the future was a total redesign of the desktop paradigm.

1044
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:45,480
And then this crazy ass Mate project came along and forked GTK2-based Gnome 2 and was

1045
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,480
this total stick in the mud, not going to go anywhere desktop.

1046
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,480
Look at this.

1047
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,480
This is the butt of all jokes here of desktop Linux.

1048
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,620
And fast forward to frickin' 2018, and it sounds like one of the most complete high

1049
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:09,640
DPI implementations that, I mean, it's just, there's few other desktops, really.

1050
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:17,100
There's Gnome 3, the Pantheon desktop, even Plasma, well, yeah, I mean, as somebody who

1051
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:23,080
used the most current Plasma on a high DPI display, it takes two or three or four settings

1052
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,680
changes to get it accurate, to get it right.

1053
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,680
Oh, right, okay.

1054
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,680
Yeah.

1055
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,520
I wouldn't know, but that's interesting to hear.

1056
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,680
I think you're in the lead there.

1057
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,800
I mean, you're not elementary OS and maybe not Gnome 3, but you're pretty damn close

1058
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,800
now.

1059
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,160
And this is supposed to be the joke desktop, don't you know that?

1060
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,800
I had heard, yeah.

1061
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:49,520
I think this is probably something that the other desktop environment developers can learn

1062
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,520
from.

1063
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,520
Yeah.

1064
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,160
Real quick question though.

1065
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,160
Go ahead.

1066
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:02,200
So would this lead to any sort of feature toward a window management as in like having

1067
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:08,980
four, like a quadrant style windows in some way, shape or form?

1068
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,600
Interesting that you should ask that question.

1069
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:16,160
So one of the other features of Marco, the default window manager for Mate is that we've

1070
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:22,240
fully implemented quadrant and top and bottom panel tiling that has actually been there

1071
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,160
for a long, long time, but it was only activateable through key bindings.

1072
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,420
But now if you drag to the corners and the tops and the bottoms, it will snap to those

1073
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:35,840
locations and not just do side by side tiling now.

1074
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,840
So that's in.

1075
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,840
That's nice.

1076
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,840
That's nice.

1077
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,840
Yeah.

1078
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,920
And GLX acceleration for Marco.

1079
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:47,040
And I'm hoping there's another couple of patches for Kaja that make that a bit more interesting

1080
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,040
as well.

1081
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,040
Oh, how so?

1082
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:54,160
But, well, I'm looking at trying to land tracker support for Mate 120.

1083
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,160
For search?

1084
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,160
Yeah.

1085
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,160
Yeah.

1086
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,160
For desktop search.

1087
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,160
Yeah.

1088
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,160
Yeah.

1089
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,680
Because at the moment that's the old, old desktop search and it's slow.

1090
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:07,400
And there are the tracker implementation is much improved in recent years, so that's looking

1091
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,400
quite interesting.

1092
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,960
Is that what files, is that what files uses?

1093
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,960
Yes.

1094
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,960
It does.

1095
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,960
Yes.

1096
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,960
Okay.

1097
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,960
That's all.

1098
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,160
And then other changes that we've made in Ubuntu Mate just over the weekend is that

1099
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,240
indicators are now enabled by default in all layouts.

1100
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,240
So it's indicators all the way.

1101
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,240
That's awesome.

1102
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,240
Yeah.

1103
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,960
And that's, there's another project I'll speak about another day because I don't want to

1104
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,000
go on too long, that dovetails with that.

1105
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,920
And then the other change we've made in the traditional layout.

1106
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:42,540
So this is the OG GNOME 2 panel layout.

1107
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:47,160
One change we've made is if you remember, it's applications places system.

1108
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:54,840
It now reads menu places system and the menu is brisk menu with super key support, but

1109
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:57,400
retains the places and system piece that people like.

1110
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:04,160
So you still get that traditional UI, but you get the benefit of super key for those

1111
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,120
people that like to mash the super key.

1112
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:10,720
Boy, you are making my life so much harder, you bastard right now.

1113
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,640
I can't even with this.

1114
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,840
The Mate desktop is so appealing.

1115
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,800
When I went through this whole rash of switching from Arch to Ubuntu, I went Unity on almost

1116
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,800
all of the things.

1117
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,400
You were the Unity guy.

1118
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,080
Except for two computers, my workstation in my office upstairs and the machines that I,

1119
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,840
actually it's three because one's a VPS, that I asked to go into.

1120
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,840
That doesn't count.

1121
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,840
No.

1122
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:39,360
But out of all of them now, here we are several months into it, they have been my go-to workstations.

1123
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,760
They have been so solid wimpy.

1124
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:47,200
I am such a fan of the project having, I'm almost what, five months, four months into

1125
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,200
using them.

1126
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,720
It's just been so great.

1127
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:55,600
So huge, huge thank you specifically for Ubuntu Mate because that's what I'm using.

1128
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:59,440
But the great thing is, I mean, has there been anything we've discussed that isn't available

1129
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,920
upstream to the Mate project itself for all distros?

1130
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,640
No, everything's upstream.

1131
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:12,200
It's down to the different distro maintainers as to how they want to implement Mate itself.

1132
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:19,520
The one conversation that we've had today is that we've landed the turn on high DPI

1133
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:28,280
in Mate tweak, which although is cross desktop, but cross distro, it sits in the Ubuntu Mate

1134
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,400
hub organization.

1135
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:36,120
So we've been talking about moving that to the Mate project and actually making it a

1136
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:42,640
full Mate thing because that's now got a feature that other distro maintainers will likely

1137
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,640
want.

1138
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,520
But Mate tweak is used quite widely now anyway.

1139
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:54,640
I'm just struck by the fact that before 1804 has arrived, before the big Ubuntu Mate LTS

1140
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:01,160
has arrived, even with the Ubuntu Mate 1710 release, you've managed to take what was the

1141
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:08,000
butt of a joke and turn it into a desktop that is one of my favorites.

1142
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,560
And with these improvements, it just sounds like it's going to be even freaking better.

1143
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,960
Yeah, high DPI support, desktop icons.

1144
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,160
It's you and a lot of folks.

1145
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:21,200
I mean, I don't want to discount the work, but I know that there's a driving force behind

1146
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,440
a lot of this and that driving force is you.

1147
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,440
Yeah, there is.

1148
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:30,680
And for a lot of this, I'm a mouthpiece, you know, the Mate team, I play a relatively small

1149
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,680
part in.

1150
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:36,680
I turn up and do this sort of thing from time to time and I test bugs and triage bugs and

1151
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,680
raise bugs.

1152
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:43,000
I have little coding time for Mate itself because what coding time I have, I put into

1153
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,920
Ubuntu Mate and the Ubuntu Mate specific things.

1154
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,160
But there is a small group of people who are very dedicated working on Mate and you just

1155
01:00:53,160 --> 01:01:00,200
have to look at the GitHub churn, you know, it's quite the commit rate, you know, it moves

1156
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,200
every day.

1157
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,200
It's not slow moving.

1158
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,640
It's a fast, fast moving project.

1159
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:10,160
And Ubuntu Mate, I made it for other people and I was maintaining it for other people

1160
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,800
and I was using it because I felt I needed to because that's how I would see what the

1161
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,280
rough edges were to improve it for others.

1162
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:23,560
But with Ubuntu Mate 17.10, so after three years of making this thing, I finally had

1163
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:29,880
a desktop environment that I was really proud of and was happy to use, really happy to use

1164
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,120
on a day to day basis.

1165
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,520
And with 18.04, I feel that even more.

1166
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,840
I actually feel like, you know, I've made something here that I'm really proud of and

1167
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,020
I'm happy to use.

1168
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:44,400
And those two features we've talked about today, the Dash menu in Brisk and this work

1169
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:51,440
on high DPI, both of those projects were funded through the generous support that we get through

1170
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,180
our Patreon.

1171
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:58,960
So you know, big thanks to everyone who's supporting Ubuntu Mate on the Patreon because

1172
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,960
you've supported that development that happened in the Solus project on Brisk and this upstream

1173
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,320
development in the Mate desktop.

1174
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,960
And all of these distros get to benefit from that.

1175
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,200
So well done you for supporting the project, everyone.

1176
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,320
And it's been fascinating, it's just been it's been a lot of fun, really, to watch the

1177
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:22,880
development of this patreon.com slash Ubuntu underscore Mate if you want to get in on the

1178
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,880
action.

1179
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,520
Boy, I I don't know how I'm going to contain myself.

1180
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,120
It's almost too many good options.

1181
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,980
You know, I've got so I've got Unity seven, of course, the did rocks is pulling me back

1182
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:33,980
to gnome three.

1183
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:37,480
Like there's some weird draw I have to going back to gnome.

1184
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,960
There's something about gnome.

1185
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:39,960
It pulls me back.

1186
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,560
KDE, KDE plasma is doing great stuff.

1187
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:47,200
Yeah, I hear rumors coming out of another flavor in Ubuntu that there's some interesting

1188
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,360
stuff going on there as well.

1189
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:54,360
So I think this year is going to be a it's good, a good year for the Linux desktop in

1190
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,840
terms of the desktop environments.

1191
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:03,360
Yeah, I've got a 2013 MacBook Pro running arch Linux that has the plasma 512 desktop.

1192
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,500
And it was one of those things where I was really putting off the updates.

1193
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:07,880
We talked about this recently.

1194
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,640
I brought that whole damn machine.

1195
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,320
I mean, it could have been as much as I hate to say it.

1196
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:18,840
I hate to say it four or five months behind, which is a bad move on arch.

1197
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,840
That is a bad move.

1198
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,320
But I've been on the my fi, you know, and I was just convinced after a couple of months

1199
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:27,660
that plasma desktop would break like a bitch after I tried to update it.

1200
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:32,160
And I sat down, I got through all of my GPG key errors.

1201
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,120
I got through all of these little esoteric like package conflicts problems that just

1202
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,280
took like a little bit of time to work through.

1203
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:40,280
Command here.

1204
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,280
Command there.

1205
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,280
Yeah.

1206
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:46,360
And I finally got every damn package on that MacBook that you set up live on the show.

1207
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,360
Right.

1208
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,360
Updated.

1209
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,760
And I was convinced after the reboot plasma wouldn't log in, because that was my experience

1210
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,760
in the good old days.

1211
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,160
Oh, yeah, I know that feeling.

1212
01:03:55,160 --> 01:04:01,560
And sure enough, I rebooted, logged back in and my desktop, the plasma desktop was exactly

1213
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,640
exactly where I left it and performing better than ever.

1214
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,640
Just snappy as hell.

1215
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,080
Just clearly faster than Mac OS on the same hardware.

1216
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,080
So it is a good year.

1217
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,900
You got you got you got the you got folks that are doing a unity remix.

1218
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,960
Gnome three's got more attention than it's ever had in its entire existence.

1219
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,640
More hands on the code, more eyes on the code, more companies working with the code than

1220
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,800
have ever, ever been.

1221
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:29,880
And and the plasma desktop, the five series is in a super stable position.

1222
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,600
They're about to release their next LTS.

1223
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,200
They've really matured the project.

1224
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,960
So that's in a really good spot.

1225
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:40,640
And then Mahatay is bringing in like these killer features for high DPI and the new launcher

1226
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,700
is just got all kinds of options.

1227
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:43,700
It's too damn much.

1228
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,700
Yeah, it is.

1229
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:46,820
So we just need a few applications.

1230
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:50,040
That's what that's really what it takes is we just need a few more good apps.

1231
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:56,680
Before we go there, though, I just want to say Happy Birthday to lwn.net 20 years of

1232
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,600
of service from lwn.

1233
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:04,040
And and Jonathan Covert writes over here, he says over the following years, we've borne

1234
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:08,280
witness to a long series of events that none of us could really have predicted.

1235
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:14,160
Linux got caught up in the dot com boom and with the VA systems IPO came to epitomize

1236
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,620
its success.

1237
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,960
But when that went boom, Linux was still there stronger than ever.

1238
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,160
The SCO group tried to steal our community and work it and turn it into its own rent

1239
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,800
generating machine.

1240
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,560
In the process of fending them off, it was made clear that the Linux kernel had one of

1241
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:33,760
the cleanest code bases around companies discovered a little hobbyist system and invested billions

1242
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,960
into it, massively accelerating the development at all levels of the system.

1243
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:42,940
We learned how to scale development communities from dozens of developers to many thousands

1244
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,660
of developers.

1245
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:48,520
The security environment, which was initially defending against script kiddies playing their

1246
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:55,200
own form of capture the flag became a fight against spammers, organized criminals and nation

1247
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,560
states with vast resources.

1248
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:03,040
Google bought an obscure phone operating system called Android and used it to dominate the

1249
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,040
phone market.

1250
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:08,560
And as a result, we got mobile devices that are far more open than they would have otherwise

1251
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,560
been.

1252
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:13,360
Linux became a base software supporting the bulk of the internet economy.

1253
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:18,360
Some of our biggest contributors do not distribute Linux at all, but they use it internally,

1254
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,600
want to help and they want to make it better.

1255
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,920
It's been quite a ride.

1256
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:28,380
We in the free software community set out to change the world and we exceeded and succeeded

1257
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:29,920
beyond our wildest expectations.

1258
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:35,360
And that's in the last 20 years and you know, JB has been there for half of that ride and

1259
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,160
a lot of that we've seen ourselves.

1260
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:44,040
And so here I am like 11, 12 years into covering this area and I look at Jonathan, I think

1261
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,340
20 years.

1262
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:47,280
That's truly impressive.

1263
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,160
So congratulations to him.

1264
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:51,040
And I've been a subscriber for many, many years.

1265
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:58,440
In fact, even about two months ago, I ran into a bug on his website and he unsubscribed

1266
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,600
me even though I was only a couple of months in and I had to resubscribe.

1267
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:08,680
So I paid him twice this year for my LWN subscription and it was money well spent because it's real

1268
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,840
good journalism, you know, without the spin, without the hype.

1269
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:17,600
You look at this whole gnome desktop icons issue and that's the result of advertising

1270
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:24,960
based media where they have to get a certain amount of clicks for those images on their

1271
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:28,380
website in order to justify paying that writer.

1272
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:33,000
And so they run these articles that say gnomes development team is arrogant, removes all

1273
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
icons.

1274
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,320
Really incentivizes the drama that you try to put into your stories even when it's not

1275
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:38,320
really there.

1276
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,320
Yeah.

1277
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:44,080
And so it also serves to divide the community as well because you then get tribes building

1278
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:48,580
up on those that are going to defend gnome on this decision and those that are going

1279
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:52,760
to rally behind the, you know, what they feel is a bad decision.

1280
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:57,160
So this kind of journalism is, is self-serving for the publications themselves because it

1281
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:01,800
doesn't do our communities any good whatsoever because it just creates conflict and it's,

1282
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,840
it's one of my pet peeves and I hate it.

1283
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:10,800
Wimpy, if you and I had 12 hours for a podcast, we could not get half of why this is bad in

1284
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,800
that show.

1285
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,800
Yeah.

1286
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:17,880
But in brief, the Linux community isn't like the Mac community or in the Windows community.

1287
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:25,000
It is, we, we are, we are much more exposed and so when the discussions, when the discussion

1288
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:32,120
is set low, when you have, when you have clickbait YouTubers and clickbait bloggers that, that

1289
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:37,100
just want to get clicks and so they start the, they start the discussion at the lowest

1290
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:38,600
common denominator.

1291
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:44,360
They start the discussion in the mud and so that's, so that creates the spectrum of conversation

1292
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,800
and then you have people on the other side and you have people in the middle and it just

1293
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:52,680
turns out into a full-on turf war and it's just simply because of the way the advertising

1294
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:58,240
model works and it's one of those things that I think I say maybe 200 times out of 233 episodes,

1295
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,880
I think I've maybe mentioned this in 200 episodes.

1296
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:05,920
But if you're not in the business and I, and I'm not like, I mean I'm just barely in the

1297
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:10,480
business but even if you just get a peek, if you just see behind the curtain for 15

1298
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:16,400
seconds, you realize what's going on here and how it directly damages an open community.

1299
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,480
When you have a bunch of employees behind a closed door at Apple that are doing what

1300
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:25,120
Phil Schiller tells them to do or they're doing what Craig Federighi comes up with or

1301
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,880
they're doing what Johnny Ive tells them to do, it doesn't matter what some jackass on

1302
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,560
Hacker News or on Reddit says.

1303
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:37,440
They can say whatever they want all day long, Johnny Ive told them what to do.

1304
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:41,760
But when a person is volunteering their personal time, maybe even at the exclusion of time

1305
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:46,920
with their friends and family to work on an open source project, that stupid thing that

1306
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:51,540
somebody says on Reddit has 10 times the impact on an open source developer.

1307
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:56,400
Or that stupid thing that somebody said on YouTube that they made a video about can completely

1308
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,320
derail a project.

1309
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:05,040
And there's people in this community at all of the major companies that you know of.

1310
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:09,560
If I say to you, listen or think of an open source company, I've probably had conversations

1311
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:14,080
with people at that company that are no longer working on projects simply because they can't

1312
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,940
take community reaction anymore.

1313
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:19,480
And you name a major open source company, and I've had a conversation with somebody

1314
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,700
from there about it.

1315
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,580
It really makes a difference.

1316
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:25,160
It's something I hear about all of the time.

1317
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:32,540
And I can't really underscore how much of a difference that outlets like LWN can make

1318
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:33,540
in this.

1319
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:43,680
That's why I am a subscriber because the focus for LWN.net is not pissing off their subscribers.

1320
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:48,360
Not how many clicks can I get so that way I can go get the new HelloFresh advertising

1321
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,360
contract.

1322
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,440
Can I make the people that are paying me on a monthly basis happy?

1323
01:10:53,440 --> 01:11:00,680
There's what I think LWN has been so dependable for me for how many years that it is just

1324
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:06,360
indispensable, included with its built-in comments section below, forum style, even

1325
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,360
though it's a new site.

1326
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,920
It is beautiful.

1327
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:10,920
Yeah.

1328
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:16,840
And it kind of makes me wish that Patreon didn't get oversaturated because I also think

1329
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:21,320
that the things that make LWN great are the same kind of things that could make an open

1330
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,320
source project great.

1331
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,520
If an open source project is held responsible to its primary patrons, then it's not going

1332
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,040
after the trend of the week.

1333
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:31,840
If a podcast network is held after its primary patrons, then you're not worried about them

1334
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,920
trying to just build up enough clickbaity content so that way they can get yet another

1335
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,120
sponsor.

1336
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:45,040
And it just is a shame that every Tom, Dick, and Harry that lives in a van or makes a song

1337
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:51,560
or writes a video game has gone to Patreon because it's saturated the market and it's

1338
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:57,160
lowered the value in the audience's mind of sponsoring people on Patreon.

1339
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,960
But the reality is it's all about the money.

1340
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,560
You've got to follow the money.

1341
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,720
It's like why Wes' really good buddy, his long-term friend, Tobey Maguire, always says,

1342
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,720
show me the money.

1343
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,880
Show me the money.

1344
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:11,080
You follow the money.

1345
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:16,480
And that's why I think LWN, after 20 years, is looked at as one of the most reliable news

1346
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,480
sources.

1347
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:22,400
And the only evidence you need of that is look at all of the coverage for Meltdown Inspector,

1348
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,400
right?

1349
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,400
Absolutely.

1350
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,920
You and I know this because we pored through all of it for TechSnap.

1351
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:31,320
There's a lot of the people that really matter in this discussion, the people that really

1352
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:37,840
know what the hell's going on, are constantly referring to LWN as LWN was on top of this

1353
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,840
for months.

1354
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,880
LWN was following this when it was rumors.

1355
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,440
LWN was accurately, technically covering this the entire time.

1356
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,520
I hope 20 years from now people will say the same damn thing about Jupiter Broadcasting.

1357
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,240
And I say, good job, Jonathan.

1358
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,240
Keep at it.

1359
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,300
And I'm going to be a subscriber.

1360
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:54,080
I'm going to continue to be a subscriber here.

1361
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,440
All right, just one more thing to get to before we're all done this week.

1362
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,540
It's exciting.

1363
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,720
It's important.

1364
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,480
And it's a great piece that was written by Joey.

1365
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,540
So let's mention Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

1366
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:10,100
That's where Wes goes, and I go, to learn more about Linux as a full-featured training

1367
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:14,680
library with everything you need to learn new skills and advance your career.

1368
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:17,160
Now, that's easy to say.

1369
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,800
But the actual implementation makes all of the difference.

1370
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,680
It's not just one of the things they do.

1371
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,280
It's all of the things.

1372
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:28,680
All of the things they do is Linux, linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

1373
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:33,120
Go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial.

1374
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,400
Self-paced, in-depth video courses on every Linux, cloud, and DevOps topic, hands-on scenario-based

1375
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,700
labs to give you real experience.

1376
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:43,760
And they got human beings that can help you whenever you need actual real help.

1377
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,840
Whether you're an experienced sysadmin or new to the world of Linux, Azure, and AWS,

1378
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:53,960
in stack and DevOps, a sharp skillset is an absolute necessity to succeed.

1379
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:59,960
Meet Linux Academy, an online Linux and cloud training platform that uses self-paced video

1380
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:06,100
courses and hands-on labs to give you real-world experience for a wide range of skills.

1381
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:10,680
Train for your certification, learn the latest DevOps tools, and grow your skillset to do

1382
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,800
better work.

1383
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,660
Linux Academy is not just a video library.

1384
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:19,540
Our scenario-based server labs and quiz system allow you to learn hands-on.

1385
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:24,960
We also have full-time human instructors who answer questions and help you earn that certification

1386
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,600
or promotion at work.

1387
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:31,640
We add new training every week, so you'll always be up to date on the latest tech.

1388
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:36,320
Sysadmins of every experience level use Linux Academy to stay on the bleeding edge of the

1389
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,880
Linux ecosystem.

1390
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:42,080
You should too.

1391
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:47,720
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, I think it's just a combination of their sole focus,

1392
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:52,800
the continual improvements, the full-time human beings, and the community that's stacked

1393
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,280
full of Jupyter broadcasting members.

1394
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,280
That doesn't hurt.

1395
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,760
Yeah, it's a resource like no other, and that's why it's a perfect fit right here on this

1396
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:00,960
show.

1397
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,400
Linux is one of those platforms.

1398
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,600
If you're coming from Windows and you're getting into Linux, one of the things you quickly

1399
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,840
realize is, really, you can do anything with Linux, you just need to know how.

1400
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,000
And sometimes you got to bend it in certain ways, sometimes you have to know certain incantations,

1401
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,880
and Linux Academy is a library full of all of that.

1402
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:21,760
And now with public profiles, so that way the new job you're trying to get, the new

1403
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,320
client or your current employer can see exactly all of the awesome work you've got done.

1404
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:28,920
Yeah, you can show off all that hard work.

1405
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,840
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1406
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:36,960
I don't know if everyone in the audience got a chance to see this piece by Joey, but he

1407
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:37,960
nailed it.

1408
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:43,000
I'm a big fan of Joey's work just because I know how hard he hustles.

1409
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
He really is.

1410
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,000
He really does.

1411
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:50,400
He's a hard worker, and he has had the opportunity to sit back and sort of showcase all of the

1412
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,760
good stuff that comes to the Ubuntu desktop, which generally, if somebody writes a Linux

1413
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:56,720
app, they tend to write it for Ubuntu.

1414
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,720
Yep.

1415
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,720
It's over there, and he's talked about it.

1416
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,300
Yeah, he's known about it.

1417
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:04,160
And he says, well, what the hell is going on?

1418
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,160
You like that?

1419
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,160
You hear that?

1420
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,200
That's me getting into it.

1421
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,480
That's me getting into position here to talk about this.

1422
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,200
That's how I can tell you're excited.

1423
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:16,000
And Joey says some stuff here that I just completely agree with.

1424
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,680
He says, once upon a time, I was writing about yet another music player, and it was almost

1425
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,680
meme-like.

1426
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,160
It was such a weekly occurrence.

1427
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:29,400
And just that first sentence right there resonated with me.

1428
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:36,060
When we launched the Linux Action Show Picks, it was a conversation that went something

1429
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,960
like this.

1430
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:43,560
There's so many apps that we're not getting to that we need to just stop waiting to review

1431
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,680
each one of them and just talk about them.

1432
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:49,800
Because there's too many apps, and we've got to just talk about them.

1433
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:55,200
And so we carved out an app pick segment that we ran every single week at the top of the

1434
01:16:55,200 --> 01:17:01,480
show that was yet another application for the Linux desktop.

1435
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:04,600
And we started that segment because there was an abundance of apps.

1436
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,680
It was easy pickings, right?

1437
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,760
You had a whole bunch to choose from.

1438
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:15,080
By the end of the Linux Action Show, that was one of the most brutal segments.

1439
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:24,800
It was a matter of just scavenging and going to producers and Beard and yourself.

1440
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:30,320
It just meant just digging and digging for something new that wasn't a web application

1441
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,000
and that wasn't Electron.

1442
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,560
And then it meant installing it and trying it.

1443
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,920
It became one of the most tedious parts of the show.

1444
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,780
And now here in this show, we just throw them in there.

1445
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:42,160
We had a couple of great ones.

1446
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,120
Because they come in spurts now.

1447
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,500
But it's not every single damn week anymore.

1448
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:47,800
And I think Joey's noticed that too.

1449
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:52,680
He says, same goes for video players, download managers, instant messengers, torrent apps,

1450
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:58,120
image editors, Twitter apps, image viewers, text editors, photo uploaders, you name it.

1451
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:02,360
I probably wrote about it, and it seemed like for a long while, app developers were out

1452
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:07,080
there in mass creating quality apps to satisfy a full gamut of end user needs.

1453
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:13,500
These days, though, availability of new native Linux apps which cater to users of the most

1454
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:20,520
popular distributions seem few and far between.

1455
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,360
We do have a lot of Electron apps.

1456
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,360
Go ahead.

1457
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,920
There's no winning here.

1458
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:31,240
So when I look at these Electron apps, it's a sensible cost efficiency thing.

1459
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,320
Also, the people developing have changed.

1460
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:41,080
I think a lot of people that used to develop for the Linux's used to be people doing it

1461
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,080
for a hobby.

1462
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:46,560
That's why so many, yet another video player is usually you want to start with something

1463
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,160
you can look at the reference of implementation.

1464
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,160
Yeah.

1465
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,160
You were doing it because you wanted to.

1466
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,160
Yes.

1467
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:55,080
And a lot of people then learned the brutal way that you can't make money if you're not

1468
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:59,120
doing like a business, market research on what you're building, if you're just building

1469
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,480
something that you have a lot of competition in.

1470
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:09,320
And nowadays, the people writing apps have two other categories, which I think is the

1471
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,320
primary focus.

1472
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,320
Right.

1473
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:15,180
So if you're developing an app for Ubuntu, you know that there's some commercial backing.

1474
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:20,480
So the system and the platform that you're building and targeting is not just shifting

1475
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,480
out random.

1476
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:27,480
You can reach somebody to know what they're going for and that gives you stability, but

1477
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:32,800
also means that a lot of the apps is not consumer or front user facing, but rather actually

1478
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,680
enterprise facing.

1479
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:40,320
And that's the part that is harder to see on the repository, but it exists actually

1480
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,320
in higher quantity.

1481
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:46,800
Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many ports of developer tools, even from, you know, proprietary

1482
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:48,360
building software companies.

1483
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,360
Okay.

1484
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,360
Fair enough.

1485
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:59,000
So I'm picking up what you're putting down, but I think I kind of disagree in some ways.

1486
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:05,040
I can't really fully disagree with you, Daredevil, but I mean, looking at this, I have to point

1487
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:10,080
to our friends over at elementary OS, which have an abundance of native applications right

1488
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,080
now.

1489
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:15,840
They just have a smattering, if you will, a buffet.

1490
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:22,160
I think the elementary OS has one thing that is what distinguishes them and makes it appealing

1491
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:24,320
for developers, which is all right.

1492
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:28,960
A lot of people are good at developing, like developing code, but they're not designers

1493
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:29,960
themselves.

1494
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:37,000
Then having these semi-authoritarian view on how things should look like presents a

1495
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,000
design.

1496
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,880
And if you're a developer and you don't really want to do design stuff, but you want to write

1497
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:48,600
that cool app, well, you go with them because he just does the design for you.

1498
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,960
Don't you feel like you're underselling what they're doing?

1499
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,920
I mean, aren't they really saying, here's a set of toolkits you can use so you have

1500
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,360
consistent design.

1501
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:01,560
Here's a set of really good, easy to read, easy to understand, and oh, by the way, easy

1502
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,960
to find documentation.

1503
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:06,040
Oh, and then you want to monetize that son of a bitch.

1504
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:10,680
Well here's an app store with a payment system that's built around Stripe that you already

1505
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,000
trust and know.

1506
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Sounds like iOS.

1507
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,640
I mean, it just seems like, yeah, you could say it's authoritarianism, you could say it's

1508
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:22,240
a design vision, but to me it seems like just a practical path, there's a breadcrumb path

1509
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:25,000
for developers to follow.

1510
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,120
That breadcrumb path has been there since day one.

1511
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:31,760
But the thing that catered most of the developers that I've talked to that moved to elementary

1512
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,720
to build their app is, hey, there's this guy, he's good in design, I wonder if he has input

1513
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:39,320
on my app and I'll build this thing.

1514
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,680
Because they're not designers, right?

1515
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:45,680
They're just one like, I want to spend my time writing this new cool machine learning

1516
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:50,160
technique and I want to implement that in the music store or whatever, right, in the

1517
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:51,160
music player.

1518
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:52,200
How can I do that?

1519
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:57,280
But then I don't have the outreach to users and everybody feels useful if they can help

1520
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,280
somebody.

1521
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,400
And that's the part that if you know users are going to find your application pretty,

1522
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:04,760
they will use it even if it sucks for the beginning because it's pretty.

1523
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:08,200
And this is, I think, the strategy Apple has figured out.

1524
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:12,040
If you have a pretty app, even if it sucks in the beginning, the user will put up with

1525
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:14,400
it because it's not as unpleasant to be there.

1526
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:19,080
And if it's a productivity app, you probably don't mind using if it's ugly because you

1527
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,440
know you'll get your shit done, essentially.

1528
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:21,440
Yeah.

1529
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,440
Yeah.

1530
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:25,840
And as long as they show that they eventually add more stuff and make it better, you're

1531
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,720
more likely to say, okay, yeah, I'll live with this on the rough edges.

1532
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:33,800
JJ, I know you had a comment about how perhaps Snaps and Flatpak could help even this whole

1533
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,800
problem out.

1534
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:40,880
Well, maybe Snaps more or less because a lot more of the mainstream applications are coming

1535
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:47,360
via Snaps, such as Spotify and other apps that seem to be more...

1536
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,360
Yeah, Slack.

1537
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:54,560
You know, we should mention Slack is now being distributed as a Snap as of last week's episode.

1538
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,560
That's huge.

1539
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:56,560
Yeah.

1540
01:22:56,560 --> 01:23:06,840
And so, and this being an ease of entry for bigger app creators to get into Linux, it

1541
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:16,160
sort of makes the jump from going from Windows and OSX to making and also making this less

1542
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:23,960
of a daunting task and having to develop for a lot of out of distributions rather than

1543
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:30,200
and only focus on one form of that app and you don't have to be specific to a specific

1544
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,560
subset of apps.

1545
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:40,120
I know most of the time that Linux developers usually initially do Debian application packages,

1546
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,120
don't they?

1547
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,520
Well, it depends on who they're trying to target.

1548
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,520
I actually have a...

1549
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,520
Before we go...

1550
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,520
Okay, go ahead.

1551
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,880
And then I have a question for Wimpy about some technical limitations with Snaps.

1552
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:50,880
Go ahead.

1553
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,040
And the only thing I just actually wanted to say is that actually the example of the

1554
01:23:54,040 --> 01:24:00,400
apps demonstrated in here are just yet another reinforcing point to the companies being the

1555
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,880
primary target nowadays.

1556
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:08,080
See, if you are Spotify and Linux user base is not easy to quantify because of the self-reporting

1557
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:13,960
part of it, and before you decide to invest in making an app for Linux that is going to

1558
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:19,280
be native there, it's going to work there, it is hard for you to justify the price, except

1559
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:24,280
if you can actually know of many other services that are being used by enterprises, and then

1560
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:27,040
you know at least this quantity of people because it's more measurable.

1561
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,520
You can say, this company has these many users.

1562
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:34,280
So then they become capable of saying, it's worthwhile to invest in here because we have

1563
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:40,040
these many customers accessing from this platform right now, and if we actually make an app,

1564
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:44,480
they will be better served, and as a consequence, we'll have better customers willing to pay

1565
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,720
higher premiums.

1566
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:52,080
And it's better outcomes for normals who want to transition over to Linux because they feel

1567
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:56,320
fed up with OSX, and also they don't have to mess with wine as much.

1568
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:58,260
Well, that's a fair point.

1569
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:05,840
So let's talk about flat packs and snaps, and I have a question for Mr. Wimpress.

1570
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:11,520
Is it possible with snaps to ship like a runtime in the snap?

1571
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:16,920
And what I mean by that is, could I ship a enterprise Java application where the Java

1572
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,240
runtime is just all inside the single snap?

1573
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:25,120
Could I ship TeamViewer that uses some sort of wine runtime where that is all packaged

1574
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,580
inside the snap?

1575
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:33,200
Is it possible that some of these like these gap covering solutions that we've come up

1576
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:37,120
with, these things that help people transition from Windows to Linux, could those just be

1577
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:43,020
included as one single snap, so I as an end user, I snap install TeamViewer, of course

1578
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:47,360
I recognize TeamViewer 13 as native now, but I as an end user for this example install

1579
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:52,360
TeamViewer via snap, and I just get the wine runtime and all that stuff inside the snap?

1580
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,840
Is that technically possible right now, Wimpy?

1581
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:59,000
Yes, and there are snaps that already do precisely those things that you outlined.

1582
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,120
Okay, I thought it wasn't for some reason.

1583
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,520
I thought that was something that flat pack could do that snaps couldn't.

1584
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:10,760
So in the case of Java, JetBrains have published the vast majority of their product portfolio

1585
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:19,080
and those are all Java based and they have their own custom build of the JVM inside the

1586
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,360
snap in order to make those work.

1587
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:31,040
And then our friend Alan Pope has made a snap of ZZT, which is an old DOS based adventure

1588
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:38,360
game and that ships DOSBox inside the snap and then uses DOSBox to launch the game.

1589
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:44,640
One of the Ubuntu podcast listeners, McPhail, has done the same with Blades of Agony, which

1590
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:54,320
is a Doom mod or re-implementation and that uses DOSBox embedded and I happen to know

1591
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:58,640
it's not publicly available but I happen to know one of my colleagues at Canonical created

1592
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:03,040
a snap of Internet Explorer by using wine.

1593
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:09,960
I love it, of course.

1594
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:10,960
Of course, why not, right?

1595
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,040
That just makes my day.

1596
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:22,000
So I'm struck with one thing that I take away from this is we are, as Linux users, experiencing

1597
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,800
something that the wider market is currently going through.

1598
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:36,040
When you install Slack on Windows 10, I've got news for you, when you use Atom on your

1599
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:40,600
Mac, it's not just a Linux phenomenon.

1600
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,060
This is happening to the entire market.

1601
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:49,280
This is the consequence of mobile and the web becoming predominant platforms.

1602
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:54,400
The web and mobile are what people are writing for today that are spending millions of dollars

1603
01:27:54,400 --> 01:28:02,720
on developers, for the most part, and the desktop is sort of a second-class to third-class

1604
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:07,200
citizen now in this new world that we see ourselves in 2018.

1605
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:11,600
Many people would rather write a LadyTube skill than a Linux desktop application.

1606
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:14,120
Simply put, it would be more valuable.

1607
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:16,800
You know, I'll give you an example.

1608
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:22,200
There's a lot of different podcast networks that are writing LadyTube apps right now so

1609
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:27,320
you can listen to podcasts on your LadyTube, and they're not really all that interested

1610
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,800
and don't really give any shits about the Linux desktop.

1611
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,960
It's just not on their radar.

1612
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:39,240
It's a simple market dynamics, market force that we are also at the whim of, just like

1613
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,360
Mac users are.

1614
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:47,440
I've got some thoughts about this that put this into context.

1615
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:54,720
Currently there are 46 GNOME applications that make up the core GNOME applications,

1616
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:55,720
right?

1617
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:56,720
Okay.

1618
01:28:56,720 --> 01:28:59,440
More or less.

1619
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:03,580
Elementary have been doing a fine job with their developer outreach and their developer

1620
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:09,960
program and their app store, and they now have 70 apps in their store, which is a fantastic

1621
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:12,480
achievement considering the size of their team.

1622
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:16,440
I think they're punching above their weight in that respect.

1623
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,000
Absolutely.

1624
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:24,400
There are 30,000 to 40,000 packages in the Debian and Ubuntu archives.

1625
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:32,400
That includes libfu and devthis and all the rest of it, right?

1626
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,720
There are approximately 50,000 electron applications on GitHub.

1627
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,920
Oh boy.

1628
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:39,920
Well put.

1629
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:40,920
Right there.

1630
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:44,320
That's it, isn't it?

1631
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,480
That puts it all in context.

1632
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:46,480
It sure does.

1633
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,480
Thank you, Mr. Wimpress.

1634
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:52,040
Go find out more about what Wimpy's up to and his whole crew, the Ubuntu podcast.

1635
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:56,200
There's plenty of fine episodes ready for you to listen to.

1636
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:59,760
The season hasn't started yet, the new season, although rumor has it it may come around.

1637
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:00,760
Is that right?

1638
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:01,760
Possibly.

1639
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,380
So go get more of that Ubuntu podcast.

1640
01:30:03,380 --> 01:30:09,060
Go get more Westpane at Westpane and also TechSnap.Systems.

1641
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:14,060
Brand new episode just went out this morning where Wes breaks down configuration management

1642
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:18,920
for thousands of systems to your personal Linux workstation.

1643
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,600
I'm at Chris Hellyes, Networks at Jupyter Signal.

1644
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:45,360
See you right back here, next week.

1645
01:30:52,480 --> 01:31:05,120
All right, guys.

1646
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,120
That was a lot of fun.

1647
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,760
I really enjoyed this week's episode.

1648
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:08,760
That was kick ass.

1649
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:09,760
Thank you.

1650
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,760
And that's really wimpy.

1651
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,560
That really puts it all into perspective, too, doesn't it?

1652
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,360
You're trying to hit an hour and a half for episode blank.

1653
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,140
Well, you know, we got to make room now for the Ask Noah show.

1654
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,960
This is a bit of a longer show, but we got to make room for Noah.

1655
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,960
He's coming.

1656
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:22,960
And there's no avoiding it.

1657
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:23,960
He can't stop him.

1658
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:24,960
No.

1659
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:25,960
He can't stop Noah.

1660
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:26,960
Don't even try.

1661
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:27,960
Chris.

1662
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:28,960
Yeah.

1663
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:29,960
Yeah.

1664
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:31,040
I got a quick question about Wi-Fi adapters.

1665
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:34,800
So my dad's looking to get me a USB Wi-Fi adapter for my machine.

1666
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:35,800
Oh, that's nice of him.

1667
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:36,800
Yeah.

1668
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:42,560
You see, I'm upstairs in my room right now talking to you guys on my phone, but my desktop,

1669
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:46,520
it has a D-Link DWA 125 Wi-Fi adapter.

1670
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:52,120
It's USB-N only, and I need an AC adapter, and I was wondering if you had any suggestions

1671
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,120
for me.

1672
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,120
Oh, I don't.

1673
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:55,120
I don't.

1674
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,560
I mean, I have so many things.

1675
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:02,080
There's a lot going on with what you just said, and boy.

1676
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:04,360
You know, what's your budget?

1677
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:06,120
So let's start there.

1678
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:11,760
My dad said he's willing to go at least 60, but he'd prefer to keep it a little bit lower.

1679
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,760
Okay.

1680
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:13,760
All right.

1681
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,760
And what kind of machine you're plugging in?

1682
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:15,760
It's got to be USB?

1683
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,320
It's got to be a tower.

1684
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:22,560
It's a custom-built machine, and it does have USB 3 capabilities.

1685
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:24,600
Maybe you should ask Noah.

1686
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:29,280
Hey, Citizen, by the way, I got to say, Oh Hi DPI is really funny.

1687
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,280
That's really good.

1688
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:31,960
That's a good title, by the way.

1689
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,160
Well, I'll ask Noah, I guess, when he comes on, because he may be the better person to

1690
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,160
ask that kind of person.

1691
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:38,160
Does anybody have any hardware?

1692
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:40,640
Does anybody have any hardware recommendations for that?

1693
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:45,200
Asus Dongle, they have one that is pretty good.

1694
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:46,200
I'm trying to find it.

1695
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,920
And is that Asus one, is it like an Intel chipset on the inside, or what is that?

1696
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,640
I just posted it in the chat.

1697
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:51,640
Oh yeah?

1698
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:52,640
Okay.

1699
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,640
Very good.

1700
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:54,640
Okay, Rekai.

1701
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:55,640
There you go.

1702
01:32:55,640 --> 01:32:56,640
And Best Buy's got it, too.

1703
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,840
So it's an Asus dual-band wireless AC USB network adapter.

1704
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:02,120
And I'm fairly close to St. Matthew's portion of Louisville, Kentucky.

1705
01:33:02,120 --> 01:33:07,200
So hopefully I might just have him go down and pick it up.

1706
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,200
Just one thing.

1707
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,200
Just one thing.

1708
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,200
That's nice.

1709
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:13,400
That's just basically the size of like a mouse wireless adapter.

1710
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,400
Yeah.

1711
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,280
Just one small thing, though.

1712
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:21,680
Because you're using in tower, and the tower itself can interfere with wireless, make sure

1713
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:25,360
that you have an adapter in case you need like a cable, an extension cable.

1714
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,360
Yes.

1715
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,360
You can actually-

1716
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,360
Get a USB extender cable.

1717
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,360
He's absolutely right.

1718
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:33,160
So get a USB extender cable, and then put this at the end of it.

1719
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:35,520
I have had that same exact problem.

1720
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,120
That is good advice right there.

1721
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:38,120
Yeah.

1722
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:40,320
My current one is sitting up on the wall right now.

1723
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:41,320
Oh yeah.

1724
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,320
There you go.

1725
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,320
So you're hip to it.

1726
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,320
Okay.

1727
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,320
I'll definitely look into that.

1728
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:46,320
Even not in the wall.

1729
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,320
That's what I usually do.

1730
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:48,320
What do you think, Wes?

1731
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:52,160
Oh, just in the same situation in the past, I've ended up, if you have like some of the

1732
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:56,400
cheaper and like older Wi-Fi hardware just sitting around, you can flash a lot of those

1733
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:59,840
routers, add them as just a Wi-Fi adapter plug and plug it into your-

1734
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:00,840
A bridge.

1735
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:01,840
Yeah.

1736
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:02,840
It's funny you say that.

1737
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,720
That's what I was actually going to say until he said this Asus thing.

1738
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:09,160
I was actually going to just recommend just bridge it.

1739
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:14,100
I got to tell you, at the end of the day, all my devices that are Wi-Fi bridged, I just

1740
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:15,100
like better.

1741
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:16,240
I just plug them into the ethernet port.

1742
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:17,600
The machine is none the wiser.

1743
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,240
It doesn't have to futz with the Wi-Fi stuff.

1744
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,580
It has no idea.

1745
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:23,500
And the bridge is always connected to the Wi-Fi network.

1746
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,500
And that is my-

1747
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,840
Provided your Wi-Fi doesn't change a lot.

1748
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:26,840
It works pretty well.

1749
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:27,840
Yeah.

1750
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,840
Yes.

1751
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:50,240
Thank you.
