WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.200
What do you guys think Nokia jumps in with an Android tablet are you surprised also I hear the optics on the camera quite nice

00:11.080 --> 00:15.900
No key is that if they didn't put their Nokia's ed launcher thingy on there

00:16.800 --> 00:23.080
I'd find it more appealing hmm 200. He's all about the hardware. I mean it's Android so yeah, it's Android Android

00:23.240 --> 00:27.840
Yeah, yeah, well, and you could always stall it you can always put a different launcher on there

00:27.840 --> 00:33.440
Mm-hmm Wow that does look like a look at the hardware. It does look like a great tablet doesn't it yeah

00:34.720 --> 00:41.120
I'm looking at the n1 250. Yeah 250 is what it says on a gadget. Oh really yeah

00:42.600 --> 00:47.680
That could be pretty compelling I was trying to find that information about the camera though because I heard people talking about it

00:47.680 --> 00:50.960
But I don't see the details on that on their page there

00:50.960 --> 00:57.280
Two hundred fifty dollars seven point nine inch and one tablet it'll be on sale in China first for the Chinese New Year which is February 19th

00:57.560 --> 00:59.480
So it's gonna be a little bit

00:59.480 --> 01:01.480
So we won't see it here in the u.s.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.360
probably

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Isn't this interesting

01:07.600 --> 01:14.180
Boy, they break up with Microsoft just for a little bit. It's gonna have a 2048 by 1536 resolution

01:14.180 --> 01:17.940
I predicted this when they when they sold off the mobile business to

01:17.940 --> 01:23.100
It's a Microsoft because there was a clause in the contract that said that they could start reusing the Nokia brand

01:23.860 --> 01:31.380
In 2015 like yep, they'll definitely have something ready for them. Did you catch that? It's also using that new type-c USB connector

01:31.380 --> 01:33.380
Which is that new you?

01:33.500 --> 01:38.460
Reversible connector that's not out in the market yet the very first USB can't do that doesn't suck

01:38.860 --> 01:40.100
Yeah

01:40.100 --> 01:47.180
2.4 gigahertz quad-core Intel Atom Z 3580 processor 2 gigabytes of RAM and a 32 gigabytes storage

01:47.180 --> 01:52.700
8 megapixel rear shooter and a 5 megapixel on the front not bad. Hey, we got a little video

01:52.700 --> 01:55.420
Should we watch the video this this looks pretty awesome. Oh

01:56.740 --> 01:59.900
Yeah, it's already cool. Go Nokia go oh

02:03.660 --> 02:08.040
Yeah, look at them holes there I guess that stereo speakers possibly

02:08.040 --> 02:13.080
Yeah, if you hold it wow it looks a lot like an iPad doesn't it it does yeah, I

02:14.080 --> 02:17.960
Didn't really see it until I saw it in the video, and oh, I like it though. I like that a lot

02:17.960 --> 02:21.600
That is I think an extremely compelling tablet. Oh

02:22.200 --> 02:28.640
Man, yeah, it does have that z1 launcher Android 5.0. Hey, oh it's coming with L. There's another check in the box

02:29.720 --> 02:31.280
damn

02:31.280 --> 02:33.280
Well, I think they nailed it didn't they?

02:33.280 --> 02:38.480
Good for Nokia boy. That's great. I I love Nokia hardware really love Nokia hardware, so that's yeah

02:38.480 --> 02:44.560
I like the it clearly shows that they really aren't in bed all that much in with Microsoft

02:44.960 --> 02:51.600
Because different part of the company's a different company. No I understand that but that whole philosophy is sticking with Windows related stuff

02:51.600 --> 02:57.360
I'm ready for my me go based on Nokia tablet. Hey, did you guys see that yeah, okay? People are warning that

02:57.360 --> 03:04.880
Doing something new tomorrow what they're announcing something tomorrow as well. Oh, okay, hold on all right screw the BitTorrent thing

03:04.880 --> 03:08.040
Tell me about this go to yolo.com yolo.com

03:08.840 --> 03:14.680
Yes, I'm really hoping for a yolo too, but I mean I heard about this. That's right

03:14.680 --> 03:19.760
I saw you know what I saw this. I think before last started, but I forgot to put it in the show that's right

03:20.280 --> 03:22.280
This is a

03:22.280 --> 03:29.280
So you think it's a tablet poppy I'm coming hmm if you go to review yola

03:29.960 --> 03:34.120
Blogspot.com they actually have a good write-up on it where they show

03:35.120 --> 03:41.520
the corner that yola shows compared to a like a tablet a generic tablet and

03:42.080 --> 03:43.400
the

03:43.400 --> 03:47.720
Ui is almost similar wow so there's people who are like oh

03:47.720 --> 03:52.360
I see a corner of the device. I have the picture up on the video stream if you're watching

03:53.200 --> 03:58.720
Yeah, interesting you guys we could have some cool hardware coming soon some cool hardware

03:58.720 --> 04:02.360
I'm really happy with my yola one except for the camera and screen, but

04:03.520 --> 04:05.120
Wow

04:05.120 --> 04:10.120
I'm right. You know what I'm really hoping that we get something interesting out of them boy. Oh, man

04:10.120 --> 04:12.120
I don't know what I'm hoping for

04:12.120 --> 04:19.160
I'm right. You know what I'm really hoping that we get something interesting out of them boy. Oh, maybe they'd have in time shipping for Christmas

04:19.160 --> 04:21.160
I could put it on Santa's list

04:22.760 --> 04:29.360
So I was gonna say there was there was a story about these hackers claiming. I don't quote-unquote hackers

04:30.040 --> 04:36.280
Claiming that bit torrent sync should not be trusted for sensitive data. I haven't read through the story has anybody read through this yet

04:36.280 --> 04:42.560
Well, it shouldn't be trusted anyway, and we've been telling you that right ages right because it's proprietary. It's negative in the freedom

04:43.280 --> 04:49.520
Exactly that's something that negative in the freedom right dimension. That's something that our friend

04:50.080 --> 04:54.480
Over our friends over at pulse definitely have going for them is that it's open source now

04:54.480 --> 04:59.960
We've also discussed many times the benefits of bit torrent sync so I think a lot of people understand

04:59.960 --> 05:01.960
There's pros and cons to both

05:01.960 --> 05:07.240
but I think it's pretty obvious at this point if it's not open source don't trust it with your data, and you know it's

05:07.240 --> 05:09.240
funny is I don't necessarily because

05:09.560 --> 05:16.000
Spider oak isn't fully open source. I think the client is I think I think a lot of the protocols document

05:16.000 --> 05:18.840
I don't remember that where the line is with spider oak, but I have more trust there

05:18.840 --> 05:23.440
So if you can't use pulse, and you don't want to use bit torrent sync you got to use something check out spider oak

05:23.440 --> 05:30.440
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's celebrating its cheat day. My name is Chris. And my name is Matt.

05:30.440 --> 05:37.440
Hey Matt, so it's been a few weeks almost a month that I just have been kind of going like really light on the breads and stuff

05:37.440 --> 05:42.440
Not like a hundred percent cut it out, but really light. You know just really going back to that getting back to that

05:42.440 --> 05:46.440
And it's always been great Matt. It's been great, but today before the show

05:46.440 --> 05:52.440
We're working on something huge for tomorrow, and I don't you know it's like in this it's like in this last stage where it's the most work

05:52.440 --> 05:58.440
And you don't know if you're gonna make it in time, but we have something really big for the Jupiter broadcasting network tomorrow that we're working on today

05:59.440 --> 06:03.440
But I'm like starving and like okay. I gotta order a Jimmy John's sandwich

06:03.440 --> 06:05.440
I got I can't leave

06:05.440 --> 06:07.440
You've been listening to the radio

06:07.440 --> 06:09.440
I know I gotta get the gift. I gotta get the gift

06:09.440 --> 06:11.440
I gotta get the gift

06:11.440 --> 06:16.440
I gotta get this work done, and then I gotta go do the unplugged show. I gotta go do the unplugged show

06:16.440 --> 06:19.440
So I figure I'll order Jimmy John's, but I'm gonna be a good boy lettuce wrap that sandwich

06:19.440 --> 06:21.440
I'm gonna get a lettuce wrap right yeah, yeah

06:21.440 --> 06:25.440
Sure, so I order Rekai sandwich cuz you know he's working on this project with me

06:25.440 --> 06:28.440
And I order myself a nice big lettuce wrap double up on that meat Matt

06:28.440 --> 06:31.440
I get double up on that meat, and it shows up at the front door

06:31.440 --> 06:34.440
I grab the bag I go upstairs. We get all situated in our offices

06:34.440 --> 06:36.440
We sit down and we start working again, and you know what?

06:36.440 --> 06:41.440
They put it on bread and at that point Matt. I was so hungry. I and I've been wanting a sandwich so bad man

06:41.440 --> 06:46.440
I've been wanting a sandwich so bad. I ate the whole sandwich Matt, and I got a little bit

06:46.440 --> 06:48.440
I think if I went to the doctor right now

06:48.440 --> 06:53.440
They would say Chris you are clinically diagnosed with food coma you are currently in a state of food coma and so

06:54.440 --> 06:57.440
We're gonna get through today's episode. It's gonna be kind of a thick episode

06:57.440 --> 06:59.440
There's a lot of things going on with the Debian project

06:59.440 --> 07:05.440
You've probably seen some of it, and I want to I want to walk away from today's episode after we talk about what's happened

07:06.440 --> 07:12.440
And and I want to walk away with a clear action plan that Jupiter broadcasting can take to help

07:13.440 --> 07:17.440
Change the tone of the discussion in the discourse and encourage merit-based discussion again

07:17.440 --> 07:22.440
And a sort of back away from sort of the tribal war even though it's a natural tendency

07:22.440 --> 07:25.440
What we're trying to do is we're trying to make sure that we're trying to make sure that we're making sure that we're

07:25.440 --> 07:29.440
Sort of back away from sort of the tribal war even though it's a natural tendency. What can we do?

07:29.440 --> 07:36.440
What could Jupiter broadcasting foster to promote that like more like a you know at a base level and I think there's a few possibilities there

07:36.440 --> 07:40.440
So we're gonna recap what's been going on with Debian then transition into that

07:40.440 --> 07:46.440
We've also got a few other interesting follow-up things we had a big system D survey done producer q5 sis put that together

07:46.440 --> 07:48.440
We had almost 5,000 respondents

07:49.440 --> 07:54.440
And we're gonna go over some of those responses in regards to system D in today's episode

07:54.440 --> 07:57.440
And then when we have a chance we're gonna get to

07:58.440 --> 08:02.440
Something that might sound like it's pondering a negative in reality

08:02.440 --> 08:06.440
I think we're gonna find a few strengths of desktop Linux that we can promote to future switchers

08:06.440 --> 08:09.440
So we're gonna have a lot to accomplish plus the feedback in today's episode

08:09.440 --> 08:14.440
Let me so let me bring on our panel of experts our mumble room a time-appropriate greetings mumble room

08:16.440 --> 08:18.440
Hello hello hello

08:19.440 --> 08:23.440
I'm excited because I think we're gonna accomplish something big today

08:23.440 --> 08:28.440
We're gonna. We're gonna. I feel like if we can pull off what even a little bit of what I want to discuss

08:28.440 --> 08:31.440
I'm gonna be really proud of the unplugged show

08:31.440 --> 08:35.440
But before we get to that we got a follow-up on probably what everybody else actually cares about

08:35.440 --> 08:41.440
That was the whole chromium Firefox thing we got a couple of emails Colton wrote sent one in about the chromium challenge

08:41.440 --> 08:45.440
He decided after last week's show. He's a Firefox user. He says you know what?

08:45.440 --> 08:50.440
I'm gonna take that chromium challenge. I'm gonna take that chromium challenge so after watching your Firefox challenge

08:50.440 --> 08:55.440
I decided to take it. I'm now on chromium, and I'm really amazed at what a difference there is between the two bugs

08:55.440 --> 08:59.440
I once attributed to Linux. I now attribute to Firefox for instance

08:59.440 --> 09:04.440
I had some weird full-screen flash video issues in Firefox that are completely gone now that I'm using chromium

09:04.440 --> 09:10.440
No special config required it also makes much more sense to use chromium since I have a chromecast however

09:10.440 --> 09:12.440
I didn't realize that I don't know

09:12.440 --> 09:17.440
It clicks with me now anyways. Thanks for the great show Colton now. We've got some emails that said oh, yeah

09:17.440 --> 09:23.440
I had a few problems, but Lionhead here in the Mamba room actually took the chromium challenge and

09:24.440 --> 09:29.440
His story isn't quite as positive as Colton's Lionhead. How was your chromium challenge week?

09:30.440 --> 09:32.440
Well for me it was

09:33.440 --> 09:39.440
Thrilled with several minor annoyances that when repeated a thousand times will make you go mad

09:40.440 --> 09:44.440
Like what what happened man? What happened because I felt that way about Firefox, so that's interesting

09:44.440 --> 09:50.440
Well one of the things I do is that I dark theme everything and that is a serious thing for me

09:51.440 --> 09:54.440
And when I browse reddit, which I do quite frequently

09:55.440 --> 10:01.440
It loads the white page right before it goes dark and when you do that a lot of times

10:01.440 --> 10:02.440
It flashes

10:02.440 --> 10:03.440
Yeah

10:04.440 --> 10:07.440
So one of your one of your favorite little modifications

10:08.440 --> 10:11.440
Didn't work under chromium probably in a difference in the way they render the web page

10:11.440 --> 10:18.440
Probably another thing I also like to have is the way that Firefox handles pin tabs

10:18.440 --> 10:22.440
Which was just adding an extension, but again the whole thing

10:22.440 --> 10:27.440
But why should I use something that needs an extension when it's built into your other browser?

10:28.440 --> 10:31.440
The problem I had was for some reason

10:32.440 --> 10:36.440
In the last three days. I had the random tab crashes all the time

10:36.440 --> 10:41.440
Oh, do you think it was a plug-in or just something else?

10:41.440 --> 10:46.440
I have no idea, but even empty tabs just said oh snap crashed

10:46.440 --> 10:49.440
Didn't you feel great that aw snap air though?

10:50.440 --> 10:52.440
Yes, but still

10:53.440 --> 10:57.440
No, that's fair. That's fair. So you're switching back obviously you have you already switched back to Firefox?

10:57.440 --> 10:59.440
I'm back on Firefox now

10:59.440 --> 11:01.440
You made it the week though

11:01.440 --> 11:02.440
Yep

11:02.440 --> 11:03.440
Wow I'm impressed

11:03.440 --> 11:07.440
Well, yeah that goes to show you different strokes for different browsers

11:07.440 --> 11:10.440
I don't think I have that quite right man. We need to refine that what do you

11:10.440 --> 11:12.440
You and I think we come up with a slogan there though

11:12.440 --> 11:13.440
Something something

11:13.440 --> 11:15.440
I don't know we'll have to work it out

11:15.440 --> 11:16.440
Alright so

11:16.440 --> 11:18.440
Different trousers for different browsers

11:18.440 --> 11:19.440
Okay that's good

11:19.440 --> 11:20.440
Oh I like that

11:20.440 --> 11:21.440
That really hits home

11:21.440 --> 11:24.440
I would love to do something if there was something that could work in a gecko

11:24.440 --> 11:29.440
You know for the for the gecko render like different different. I got nothing though. I'm not that quick

11:29.440 --> 11:32.440
I need I need you know some time and then then I got it

11:32.440 --> 11:33.440
Hey so

11:33.440 --> 11:35.440
Are we talking gecko the lizard or Gordon gecko?

11:35.440 --> 11:38.440
I was thinking gecko no I was thinking gecko the rendering engine

11:38.440 --> 11:39.440
Oh okay cool

11:39.440 --> 11:45.440
So a producer q5 sis ran this what he calls a quote-unquote simple systemd survey

11:45.440 --> 11:52.440
And he's now he's now published the results and so he had four thousand seven hundred and fifty five individuals who responded

11:52.440 --> 11:57.440
The survey responses show that forty seven of the respondents are in favor of systemd

11:57.440 --> 12:01.440
But I want to dig into this because I have some questions about this survey

12:01.440 --> 12:07.440
And what it shows about desktop usage versus server usage and all these kinds of things I think are a little fascinating

12:07.440 --> 12:11.440
So before we do that why don't I thank our first sponsor and that's DigitalOcean

12:11.440 --> 12:15.440
Head over to DigitalOcean right now and start checking them out while I talk about it

12:15.440 --> 12:18.440
DigitalOcean.com it's worth a visit I think you're gonna be pretty impressed

12:18.440 --> 12:20.440
So what is DigitalOcean?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.440
It's a simple cloud hosting provider

12:22.440 --> 12:27.440
And they're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up your own cloud server

12:27.440 --> 12:31.440
And if you go over there right now DigitalOcean.com check them out you can create an account in just seconds

12:31.440 --> 12:32.440
It's pretty impressive

12:32.440 --> 12:36.440
And we also have a promo code that you can use unplug November to get a ten dollar credit

12:36.440 --> 12:39.440
You apply that to the balance of your account no credit card required

12:39.440 --> 12:42.440
You can get started with a droplet for two months for free

12:42.440 --> 12:45.440
Because DigitalOcean droplet started only five dollars a month

12:45.440 --> 12:48.440
And you can get a droplet spun up in seconds

12:48.440 --> 12:54.440
Pricing plans at five dollars means you could easily afford your own own cloud instance or a WordPress install or a GitLab

12:54.440 --> 12:59.440
Or several different things or BitTorrent Sync, Pulse, maybe you want an offsite Pulse server

12:59.440 --> 13:02.440
A DigitalOcean droplet could be a great way to do it

13:02.440 --> 13:05.440
And you'll get a 512 megabyte RAM rig

13:05.440 --> 13:08.440
You'll get a 20 gigabyte SSD all SSD

13:08.440 --> 13:11.440
You'll get one blazing fast CPU on that droplet

13:11.440 --> 13:14.440
And a terabyte of dedicated transfer just to you

13:14.440 --> 13:20.440
And they have DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam and London

13:20.440 --> 13:24.440
I had an email from someone on Coder Radio on Monday

13:24.440 --> 13:27.440
Who said that he was taking part of a competition

13:27.440 --> 13:31.440
And it was a programming competition where your response had to come in in under a minute

13:31.440 --> 13:33.440
And that meant you coded the response

13:33.440 --> 13:36.440
You actually wrote up the code for the response

13:36.440 --> 13:39.440
And then had to deploy it and that would be your answer

13:39.440 --> 13:44.440
And he kept kind of just under, just like barely missing the minute mark

13:44.440 --> 13:47.440
Just like a minute five seconds, a minute three seconds

13:47.440 --> 13:50.440
You know all these, like what am I doing, a minute one second

13:50.440 --> 13:53.440
And then he realized the server was located in France

13:53.440 --> 13:56.440
So he deployed a DigitalOcean droplet over in Amsterdam

13:56.440 --> 14:00.440
Cut down that latency time and now he's in the top leaderboards

14:00.440 --> 14:01.440
Nice

14:01.440 --> 14:03.440
And DigitalOcean, you've seen the power right here on Linux Unplugged

14:03.440 --> 14:08.440
Last week when Wimpy deployed the brand new version of Ubuntu Mate edition live on the show

14:08.440 --> 14:10.440
He used DigitalOcean's resources to do that

14:10.440 --> 14:13.440
And their interface to do all of it is crazy simple and intuitive

14:13.440 --> 14:16.440
And they have an API where you can get started on your own and write some code

14:16.440 --> 14:18.440
And interact with this stuff automatically

14:18.440 --> 14:21.440
Or integrate it in with your management infrastructure

14:21.440 --> 14:24.440
Or take advantage of some of the things the community has already written

14:24.440 --> 14:25.440
It's really slick

14:25.440 --> 14:26.440
And they're paying for tutorials

14:26.440 --> 14:29.440
Because they're trying to get that up to a really high level

14:29.440 --> 14:31.440
So if you've got some experience with something

14:31.440 --> 14:34.440
Go work with DigitalOcean, we have a link in our show notes

14:34.440 --> 14:37.440
And write up a tutorial, they might pay up to $200 for that

14:37.440 --> 14:38.440
And that might be worth your time

14:38.440 --> 14:41.440
They've also got a position open right now for an editor

14:41.440 --> 14:43.440
So that could be an opportunity as well

14:43.440 --> 14:46.440
DigitalOcean.com, Unplugged November

14:46.440 --> 14:49.440
Go create a droplet, try it out

14:49.440 --> 14:52.440
Maybe play with CoreOS for a little bit and see what all the buzz is about

14:52.440 --> 14:55.440
Experience Docker, try out GitLab

14:55.440 --> 14:59.440
You might be able to tie in your own local machine configs

14:59.440 --> 15:04.440
To a GitLab deployment in a DigitalOcean droplet that you have full root control over

15:04.440 --> 15:07.440
That'd be pretty cool, I'd love to hear about it if you do something like that

15:07.440 --> 15:09.440
DigitalOcean.com, Unplugged November

15:09.440 --> 15:13.440
Big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show

15:13.440 --> 15:19.440
Okay, so Q5 broke out the stats in a pretty digestible way

15:19.440 --> 15:22.440
But he also published the raw data if you want to play with this yourself

15:22.440 --> 15:25.440
And I know some of you do, I've seen some of the comments

15:25.440 --> 15:30.440
So first he asked, do you consider yourself in favor or against SystemD?

15:30.440 --> 15:35.440
47%, 2,247 people responded in favor

15:35.440 --> 15:40.440
22% responded against, 30% undecided

15:40.440 --> 15:45.440
In the age range, 52% are 20-30 or 20-29

15:45.440 --> 15:48.440
And 28% are 30-39, 7% 40-49

15:48.440 --> 15:53.440
Which is interesting, that particular number there doesn't really reflect other demographics I've seen

15:53.440 --> 15:55.440
But who really knows

15:55.440 --> 15:57.440
How many years have you used Linux?

15:57.440 --> 16:02.440
40% responded 6-10 years, 23 responded 11-15 years

16:02.440 --> 16:05.440
And 16-20 years said 10%

16:05.440 --> 16:09.440
And 27% said 0-5

16:09.440 --> 16:11.440
What was your first Linux distro?

16:11.440 --> 16:18.440
OpenSUSE came in at 6%, Debian 41%, Fedora 18%, Arch Linux 3%

16:18.440 --> 16:26.440
Current distro, Arch Linux 37%, Fedora Red Hat 11%, Debian 28%

16:26.440 --> 16:28.440
Which I assume also includes Ubuntu

16:28.440 --> 16:33.440
And where do you live? 46% North America, 42% Europe and the others fall in

16:33.440 --> 16:41.440
Primary use, web server 44%, desktop 90% of the people that took the survey are using it as a desktop, Linux

16:41.440 --> 16:45.440
What's more important, stability or bleeding edge?

16:45.440 --> 16:52.440
32% said stability, 20% said bleeding edge, 47% said flexibility

16:52.440 --> 16:55.440
So flexibility was 47% of the response

16:55.440 --> 17:00.440
And who would win in a face-off, Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, Leonard Potter, or Captain Jean-Luc Picard?

17:00.440 --> 17:03.440
Captain Jean-Luc Picard won with 39% of the vote

17:03.440 --> 17:06.440
So there you go, and the raw data is in the notes

17:06.440 --> 17:09.440
One thing I wanted to ask you guys about

17:09.440 --> 17:15.440
What do you think about this number here, System D in favor, 47%

17:15.440 --> 17:19.440
Rotten Corps, is that in line with what you'd expect from the survey?

17:19.440 --> 17:21.440
Actually yes, pretty much

17:21.440 --> 17:23.440
I thought it might be, and why is that?

17:23.440 --> 17:32.440
I like System D, and I don't see, most of the technical issues that people have problems with System D are fixable

17:32.440 --> 17:34.440
And have already been fixed, most of them

17:34.440 --> 17:36.440
Roger that, yeah, I could see that too

17:36.440 --> 17:41.440
And it seems like maybe the people that are in favor of desktops might be more in favor of System D too

17:41.440 --> 17:45.440
And there's a lot of desktop users in the survey, that's kind of what jumped out at me

17:45.440 --> 17:48.440
The desktop thing is the most interesting, and I think it's also

17:48.440 --> 17:52.440
Because of the different districts that have jumped to System D as the default

17:52.440 --> 17:55.440
Is probably a big aspect to that

17:55.440 --> 17:59.440
It's worth noting too, that once Ubuntu makes their full switch to System D

17:59.440 --> 18:02.440
That number's going to be significantly higher as well

18:02.440 --> 18:04.440
Yeah, and that could happen in 1504

18:04.440 --> 18:07.440
That could be the next big release

18:07.440 --> 18:13.440
And I know that this is just one survey, and you can't make all of your consumptions off of this

18:13.440 --> 18:18.440
So we're going to get into this Debian stuff, right Matt?

18:18.440 --> 18:24.440
And I'm looking at this and I'm thinking, geez, when you get these surveys it seems like the majority are actually okay with what's going on with System D

18:24.440 --> 18:28.440
So as we get into this, are we talking about people that are say, harassing maintainers and stuff?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.440
Are these people on the fringe?

18:30.440 --> 18:32.440
I don't think it's necessarily that they're on the fringe

18:32.440 --> 18:36.440
I think it's that they're so passionate about their belief that

18:36.440 --> 18:40.440
And a lot of times when you're not in the largest of numbers

18:40.440 --> 18:43.440
You tend to be a little louder to make your voice heard

18:43.440 --> 18:47.440
And sometimes that's done with eloquence, and sometimes that's done like a raging chimp

18:47.440 --> 18:50.440
It really depends on the person

18:50.440 --> 18:52.440
And I've seen both from all sides

18:52.440 --> 18:56.440
I've seen raging chumps on all sides, and I've seen some really eloquent blog posts from all groups as well

18:56.440 --> 18:58.440
So it's kind of hit and miss

18:58.440 --> 19:00.440
That's a good point

19:00.440 --> 19:04.440
And I encourage you, if you have any questions or anything like that

19:04.440 --> 19:07.440
I have a link in the show notes to Q5Sys' blog post

19:07.440 --> 19:10.440
You can download the, he put it in an ODT file or something

19:10.440 --> 19:15.440
One of them open formats, I believe it was not text, however

19:15.440 --> 19:17.440
It was not text

19:17.440 --> 19:19.440
It was one of them other formats

19:19.440 --> 19:22.440
And you can download that and you can plug it into your spreadsheet of choice

19:22.440 --> 19:26.440
So Andreas writes in, and he has a question for our panel

19:26.440 --> 19:28.440
And I'd like to hear what you guys think about this

19:28.440 --> 19:32.440
He says, hello Chris and Matt, I have a thought that

19:32.440 --> 19:35.440
I have a question that I think all of you could maybe discuss

19:35.440 --> 19:37.440
And have maybe a good round table

19:37.440 --> 19:42.440
He says, what could we do as a community to improve Linux?

19:42.440 --> 19:45.440
What is it, like if you could have a magic wand today

19:45.440 --> 19:49.440
And just improve it to make it more approachable to the mainstream

19:49.440 --> 19:51.440
Would it be something like an app store?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.440
More integration between distributions?

19:53.440 --> 19:55.440
Industry support, etc, etc

19:55.440 --> 19:57.440
What could be done to Linux just to kind of spruce it up a little bit

19:57.440 --> 19:59.440
And make it more palatable?

19:59.440 --> 20:03.440
And Matt, I wanted to go to you first because I think this is along the line you write about a lot

20:03.440 --> 20:06.440
And the space you think about is make it more approachable to users

20:06.440 --> 20:11.440
If you could give somebody a Linux box and remove just a couple of immediate pain points

20:11.440 --> 20:13.440
What would those points be?

20:13.440 --> 20:19.440
Ooh, I think the first thing I would do is make sure that if it's not necessary

20:19.440 --> 20:21.440
Or it's likely to just create new problems

20:21.440 --> 20:23.440
I would do my best to hide it

20:23.440 --> 20:27.440
With the asterisk that I would like to show them how to use it properly later on

20:27.440 --> 20:30.440
But I think giving them immediate access to like say

20:30.440 --> 20:33.440
A more advanced package manager versus a simple one

20:33.440 --> 20:38.440
Do you think like an amazing app store is necessary or is that just a nice to have?

20:38.440 --> 20:41.440
Well, you know, I think it is only from the sense of discovery

20:41.440 --> 20:43.440
I think once, if you know the application you're going to get

20:43.440 --> 20:46.440
And you're willing to do whatever you want to do to get it

20:46.440 --> 20:48.440
I don't think it's critical

20:48.440 --> 20:50.440
But I do think for just Joe average

20:50.440 --> 20:52.440
It definitely is a bigger selling point

20:52.440 --> 20:55.440
It's a little bit like the spinning cube stuff we were talking about

20:55.440 --> 20:57.440
You know, a little bit of wow goes a long way

20:57.440 --> 20:58.440
Yeah, good point

20:58.440 --> 21:00.440
And it grabs their attention

21:00.440 --> 21:02.440
In fact, our next note's coming up

21:02.440 --> 21:04.440
And then you can kind of settle them down and get them grounded as you go

21:04.440 --> 21:05.440
But you know

21:05.440 --> 21:11.440
Josh, in the mumble room there, how much is a really key hardware OEM a part of this?

21:11.440 --> 21:15.440
Like somebody that would have like a storefront filled with Linux machines

21:15.440 --> 21:18.440
Is this an important piece? Is that a pain point you would resolve?

21:18.440 --> 21:20.440
Yeah, definitely

21:20.440 --> 21:24.440
I mean, a key issue with Linux is

21:24.440 --> 21:26.440
Well, I'll put this way

21:26.440 --> 21:30.440
A key issue for end users is hardware compatibility

21:30.440 --> 21:34.440
Because they want to be able to boot up their computer and know everything works

21:34.440 --> 21:37.440
They don't have to go on Ask a Boon 2 and see

21:37.440 --> 21:41.440
Oh, I have to download some weird drivers in order to get something to work

21:41.440 --> 21:46.440
If we point users to OEMs like System76

21:46.440 --> 21:50.440
Then they know immediately things are going to work out of the box

21:50.440 --> 21:52.440
And that's pretty powerful

21:52.440 --> 21:56.440
Inagogo, you think what we need is some good advertising

21:56.440 --> 22:01.440
Yeah, because Windows has a ton more advertising than Linux

22:01.440 --> 22:03.440
And what we need is advertising

22:03.440 --> 22:05.440
So people can hear about it

22:05.440 --> 22:09.440
But it also needs a bit of fixing in some circumstances

22:09.440 --> 22:12.440
So, Daredevil, do you think it's a problem with software quality?

22:14.440 --> 22:15.440
No

22:15.440 --> 22:16.440
Okay

22:16.440 --> 22:18.440
I'm thinking more of a problem

22:18.440 --> 22:19.440
I'm sorry

22:19.440 --> 22:25.440
I'm thinking more it's a problem of actually making developers happy on the platform

22:25.440 --> 22:28.440
I mean, we have all the tools and all the languages

22:28.440 --> 22:33.440
But distributions, like Ubuntu right now is doing a great effort on that department

22:33.440 --> 22:37.440
But it's pretty much almost the only one doing it

22:37.440 --> 22:41.440
We need standardized protocol to develop an app and ship it

22:41.440 --> 22:43.440
Once we have that, we have developers

22:43.440 --> 22:47.440
Developers that are approaching the platform being Linux for the first time say

22:47.440 --> 22:52.440
Alright, what SDK do I download to start making applications for this?

22:52.440 --> 22:53.440
And then the answer is

22:53.440 --> 22:54.440
Yeah

22:54.440 --> 22:58.440
And usually it all wraps around what tool we want to use

22:58.440 --> 23:00.440
And we don't support one tool really well

23:00.440 --> 23:04.440
And the problem is if developers are making the app that users want

23:04.440 --> 23:06.440
OEMs look at that and they say

23:06.440 --> 23:08.440
There's no reason to support the platform

23:08.440 --> 23:10.440
I mean, there's no one writing apps for it

23:10.440 --> 23:13.440
Rotten Corps, do you want to expand on that a little bit?

23:13.440 --> 23:17.440
Yeah, I think the actual developer thing is more than just the SDK

23:17.440 --> 23:20.440
It's also the repos

23:20.440 --> 23:24.440
As the community of Linux, people just talk about

23:24.440 --> 23:26.440
Use your official repo because that's the safest

23:26.440 --> 23:30.440
And it is true, but it's also the most annoying part for developers

23:30.440 --> 23:35.440
Because every single repo is going to have a different version of your project

23:35.440 --> 23:38.440
And then you have to contact these people

23:38.440 --> 23:41.440
You beg them to update, beg the next one to update

23:41.440 --> 23:43.440
And it just continues and continues

23:43.440 --> 23:44.440
And you have no control

23:44.440 --> 23:46.440
Frank from OEMcloud when we were at the Ohio Linux Fest said

23:46.440 --> 23:48.440
We have this very problem

23:48.440 --> 23:51.440
The issue is, is that in Debian, stable today

23:51.440 --> 23:54.440
A very, very old version of OEMcloud ships

23:54.440 --> 23:56.440
That is no longer supported by the OEMcloud project

23:56.440 --> 23:59.440
And it is a poor representation of what their project is about today

23:59.440 --> 24:01.440
It doesn't represent their quality of code

24:01.440 --> 24:03.440
It doesn't represent anything about them

24:03.440 --> 24:06.440
But yet if you apt-get install OEMcloud, you get this

24:06.440 --> 24:09.440
And to them it's a major problem and it is a disincentive for them

24:09.440 --> 24:12.440
Now, their options are to, and I think very wisely

24:12.440 --> 24:14.440
They have utilized the openSUSE build service

24:14.440 --> 24:16.440
And they generate repositories

24:16.440 --> 24:20.440
If you just did a, you know, a monocule of research on the OEMcloud website

24:20.440 --> 24:22.440
You'd know that would be the more appropriate way to install it

24:22.440 --> 24:23.440
But not everybody does that

24:23.440 --> 24:26.440
Because you expect that functionality from your distribution

24:26.440 --> 24:27.440
And you should be able to

24:27.440 --> 24:32.440
So I think the rotten corpse, I think the point about repositories is a very good one

24:32.440 --> 24:34.440
It's like, it's one of the best strengths

24:34.440 --> 24:37.440
But it can also be a disincentive to some developers

24:37.440 --> 24:40.440
The other thing is, is they lose some download stats

24:40.440 --> 24:43.440
So it's hard for them to quantify how many Linux users they have

24:43.440 --> 24:47.440
Like the, you know, we all hear this about the LibreOffice project

24:47.440 --> 24:49.440
They're not exactly sure how many Linux users they have

24:49.440 --> 24:52.440
Because most people get LibreOffice from their distro

24:52.440 --> 24:53.440
They don't download it from the website

24:53.440 --> 24:58.440
But most Windows users and Mac users do download it from the website

24:58.440 --> 25:00.440
So they get most of those counts

25:00.440 --> 25:03.440
So that, you know, when you look at that data right there

25:03.440 --> 25:06.440
The Linux users are massively underrepresented

25:06.440 --> 25:11.440
And it's, in a business sometimes, hard to really wrap their brains around that

25:11.440 --> 25:15.440
Yeah, I think it's, the download stuff is very important

25:15.440 --> 25:18.440
Because there's basically no way to find out

25:18.440 --> 25:20.440
The repos don't provide the information

25:20.440 --> 25:22.440
Like the different package managers don't do anything

25:22.440 --> 25:26.440
You can't find out anything on any distro

25:26.440 --> 25:29.440
You just have to hope that people use it

25:29.440 --> 25:32.440
Right, and some applications, you know, they work around this by

25:32.440 --> 25:34.440
And this is not necessarily a good thing

25:34.440 --> 25:35.440
By pinging home

25:35.440 --> 25:37.440
Maybe it's to check for an update

25:37.440 --> 25:39.440
Or, you know, just whatever to the servers

25:39.440 --> 25:41.440
Just send one ping off, one ping only

25:41.440 --> 25:43.440
And then, hey, bang suggest chatroom by the way

25:43.440 --> 25:44.440
Don't forget to bang suggest today

25:44.440 --> 25:46.440
One ping only, and you go out there and you ping the server

25:46.440 --> 25:51.440
And yeah, okay, now we know we have LibreOffice user 1151157892 on a Linux box

25:51.440 --> 25:52.440
I don't know

25:52.440 --> 25:54.440
But then you get people who hate you for doing that

25:54.440 --> 25:56.440
And then it just creates a bigger issue that you don't want to deal with

25:56.440 --> 25:57.440
So you don't do it

25:57.440 --> 26:00.440
And there's really no practical way

26:00.440 --> 26:03.440
It's just, you have to rely on the distros to give you information

26:03.440 --> 26:04.440
And they don't do it

26:04.440 --> 26:07.440
So those would be some areas I think we'd probably improve

26:07.440 --> 26:12.440
And this is one of the things that are

26:12.440 --> 26:16.440
It's the kind of the good end result of some standardization on SystemD

26:16.440 --> 26:21.440
Is it does normalize some of that middle section of Linux across all the distributions

26:21.440 --> 26:24.440
It is something that developers will be able to wrap their heads around

26:24.440 --> 26:27.440
That is a cross distribution commonality

26:27.440 --> 26:31.440
That is a positive thing for software coming to Linux

26:31.440 --> 26:33.440
SystemD controversy aside

26:33.440 --> 26:35.440
And so as we get closer to this discussion

26:35.440 --> 26:37.440
That's one thing to kind of keep in mind

26:37.440 --> 26:40.440
But before we go there, MJC6370

26:40.440 --> 26:41.440
Rolls right off the tongue

26:41.440 --> 26:43.440
Submitted to the subreddit 23 hours ago

26:43.440 --> 26:45.440
He says he gave a presentation

26:45.440 --> 26:46.440
And this is so cool

26:46.440 --> 26:48.440
He says everyone in the group uses Macbooks

26:48.440 --> 26:49.440
Except for me

26:49.440 --> 26:52.440
I've got a Lenovo Ultrabook and I run Linux

26:52.440 --> 26:54.440
What was a little nerve-wracking about it though

26:54.440 --> 26:58.440
Is I had to go hook up the HDMI to the projector

26:58.440 --> 27:00.440
He was a little worried because those Mac users are walking up

27:00.440 --> 27:03.440
They're plugging in their Macbooks with them HDMI ports

27:03.440 --> 27:04.440
And they're getting up on the projector

27:04.440 --> 27:05.440
He's like okay here I go

27:05.440 --> 27:06.440
I've got to show up these Mac users

27:06.440 --> 27:07.440
He goes up there with the Lenovo

27:07.440 --> 27:08.440
He plugs it in

27:08.440 --> 27:10.440
Works, no problem

27:10.440 --> 27:11.440
After the presentation

27:11.440 --> 27:13.440
Four of the thirteen people came up to say

27:13.440 --> 27:16.440
Hey, what are you running on your PC?

27:16.440 --> 27:18.440
It looks amazing

27:18.440 --> 27:20.440
One even asked what version of Windows it was

27:20.440 --> 27:21.440
Anyways, it makes me smile

27:21.440 --> 27:24.440
And he says the Numix icons seem to be catching people's eye

27:24.440 --> 27:28.440
I thought that was neat in light of our interview with the Numix guys

27:28.440 --> 27:30.440
That it seems to be

27:30.440 --> 27:33.440
And we always talk about oh yeah like Compiz grabs eyes and things like that

27:33.440 --> 27:35.440
But them Numix icons are grabbing some eyes too

27:35.440 --> 27:36.440
They're not for everybody

27:36.440 --> 27:38.440
But I thought that was a great story

27:38.440 --> 27:39.440
It's pretty cool

27:39.440 --> 27:40.440
And as a fanboy

27:40.440 --> 27:43.440
I would point out that in his article he mentioned that

27:43.440 --> 27:47.440
A big point of getting people's eye is GNOME

27:47.440 --> 27:49.440
Yeah, I think it's pretty smexy

27:49.440 --> 27:51.440
I think it is really smexy

27:51.440 --> 27:52.440
Cinnamon is good looking too

27:52.440 --> 27:54.440
But GNOME has that

27:54.440 --> 27:56.440
It has that modern look to it

27:56.440 --> 27:57.440
It looks like something a little bit different

27:57.440 --> 28:00.440
But you immediately know what it is

28:00.440 --> 28:01.440
Of course my GNOME is different than most people's GNOME

28:01.440 --> 28:02.440
I think his too

28:02.440 --> 28:05.440
I think a lot of times people have docs on the side

28:05.440 --> 28:08.440
And in my case I have a full screen doc that kind of makes it look like Unity

28:08.440 --> 28:10.440
Or I mean a full sidebar doc

28:10.440 --> 28:11.440
Hey, okay, alright

28:11.440 --> 28:12.440
So we've got to get to this Debian stuff

28:12.440 --> 28:13.440
We've been talking about it on and off

28:13.440 --> 28:14.440
Before we do that

28:14.440 --> 28:16.440
Let me give a mention here for Linux Academy

28:16.440 --> 28:18.440
Linux Academy is a great service

28:18.440 --> 28:20.440
And it's a great opportunity if you haven't checked it out

28:20.440 --> 28:24.440
Start by going over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

28:24.440 --> 28:26.440
And take a look at what they have to offer

28:26.440 --> 28:28.440
What I love about Linux Academy

28:28.440 --> 28:31.440
Is unlike some of the general online learning courses and sites that are out there

28:31.440 --> 28:33.440
And there seems to be more and more all the time

28:33.440 --> 28:35.440
People seem to figure out some sort of CMS

28:35.440 --> 28:37.440
They throw up a bunch of content on there

28:37.440 --> 28:39.440
Maybe they throw some things on YouTube

28:39.440 --> 28:41.440
Or maybe they have something really high end

28:41.440 --> 28:43.440
Where they just have so many videos that sit there and rot

28:43.440 --> 28:45.440
You know there's a whole range of services

28:45.440 --> 28:48.440
But none of them are built by Linux enthusiasts and advocates

28:48.440 --> 28:52.440
They've teamed up with friends that are educators and developers

28:52.440 --> 28:55.440
And they've created Linux Academy for you

28:55.440 --> 28:56.440
For Linux users

28:56.440 --> 28:57.440
By Linux users

28:57.440 --> 28:59.440
And they cover the whole spectrum of stuff

28:59.440 --> 29:02.440
And when you go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

29:02.440 --> 29:04.440
You're going to get a discount on your tuition

29:04.440 --> 29:06.440
A great discount, it's like 33% discount

29:06.440 --> 29:09.440
It's an amazing resource

29:09.440 --> 29:10.440
You get step-by-step video courses

29:10.440 --> 29:12.440
When you log into their dashboard

29:12.440 --> 29:14.440
You see all of the courses outlined

29:14.440 --> 29:15.440
All the different options you have

29:15.440 --> 29:16.440
And they're adding new stuff all the time

29:16.440 --> 29:18.440
They just added a whole bunch of Puppet stuff

29:18.440 --> 29:20.440
You can go check out Introduction to Puppet

29:20.440 --> 29:21.440
If you've been thinking about getting into that

29:21.440 --> 29:22.440
If you have more than a few servers

29:22.440 --> 29:24.440
You should probably think about it

29:24.440 --> 29:25.440
And they've got courseware on it now

29:25.440 --> 29:26.440
And they're adding more stuff all the time

29:26.440 --> 29:28.440
You log in, you say okay I'm going to do this Puppet course

29:28.440 --> 29:29.440
And then it opens it up

29:29.440 --> 29:30.440
It shows you all the different sections

29:30.440 --> 29:32.440
How long each section is going to take

29:32.440 --> 29:34.440
Where you can download audio and PDFs and videos

29:34.440 --> 29:35.440
It's so nice

29:35.440 --> 29:37.440
And if you get to a point where now it's time to do some

29:37.440 --> 29:39.440
Puppet configuration and deployments

29:39.440 --> 29:41.440
They'll automatically spin up a virtual server for you

29:41.440 --> 29:42.440
On demand

29:42.440 --> 29:43.440
They give you logins to it

29:43.440 --> 29:45.440
Now you're working in a production environment

29:45.440 --> 29:47.440
You're actually using the tools

29:47.440 --> 29:48.440
Along with the courseware

29:48.440 --> 29:50.440
Along with the video guides

29:50.440 --> 29:51.440
And they have live stream events

29:51.440 --> 29:53.440
Where you can ask the educators questions directly too

29:53.440 --> 29:54.440
They also have communities

29:54.440 --> 29:56.440
Kind of give you that boost when you're feeling a little down

29:56.440 --> 29:58.440
Or bottoming out a little bit

29:58.440 --> 29:59.440
And need some encouragement

29:59.440 --> 30:00.440
Or need some direction

30:00.440 --> 30:01.440
That's a great resource

30:01.440 --> 30:05.440
And they've expanded so much on their AWS and OpenStack stuff too

30:05.440 --> 30:06.440
It's pretty cool

30:06.440 --> 30:08.440
And I think one of the courses I like to recommend from time to time

30:08.440 --> 30:10.440
Is their R-Sync backup course

30:10.440 --> 30:12.440
So if you want to get a nice solid backup system

30:12.440 --> 30:13.440
With the holidays coming up

30:13.440 --> 30:14.440
You've got all these photos you're taking

30:14.440 --> 30:15.440
Why not back them up

30:15.440 --> 30:17.440
R-Sync is a great tool to do that

30:17.440 --> 30:18.440
Take it from your rig

30:18.440 --> 30:20.440
It's maybe your desktop or your laptop

30:20.440 --> 30:22.440
Send it off to your NAS

30:22.440 --> 30:23.440
Or move it just between devices

30:23.440 --> 30:24.440
Or send it over the internet

30:24.440 --> 30:25.440
Move it up to a droplet

30:25.440 --> 30:27.440
R-Sync is such an incredible tool

30:27.440 --> 30:29.440
And they have a great course on it

30:29.440 --> 30:31.440
It'll really make you an R-Sync expert

30:31.440 --> 30:32.440
But that's just the beginning

30:32.440 --> 30:34.440
They've got courseware on DevOps

30:34.440 --> 30:38.440
Python, OpenStack, Android, Ruby, AWS

30:38.440 --> 30:39.440
I mean the list goes on and on

30:39.440 --> 30:40.440
And new stuff all the time

30:40.440 --> 30:42.440
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

30:42.440 --> 30:45.440
Go find out what courseware by Linux users

30:45.440 --> 30:47.440
For Linux users is actually like

30:47.440 --> 30:49.440
You know that makes all the difference

30:49.440 --> 30:50.440
And that's why you want to go there

30:50.440 --> 30:52.440
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

30:52.440 --> 30:54.440
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

30:54.440 --> 30:56.440
The unplugged program

30:56.440 --> 30:58.440
You guys rock

30:58.440 --> 31:02.440
Okay so we don't need to dwell on the Debian stuff that much

31:02.440 --> 31:03.440
It's kind of a bummer

31:03.440 --> 31:05.440
Oh you know I should mention now before

31:05.440 --> 31:06.440
I'm sorry I keep doing this

31:06.440 --> 31:08.440
A couple of brief bits of business next week

31:08.440 --> 31:12.440
Linux unplugged is going to be an hour earlier

31:12.440 --> 31:13.440
At 1pm Pacific

31:13.440 --> 31:15.440
So you can get that in your local time

31:15.440 --> 31:17.440
At jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

31:17.440 --> 31:18.440
Please join us

31:18.440 --> 31:20.440
It's the 25th

31:20.440 --> 31:22.440
So that's not a great day

31:22.440 --> 31:24.440
And I apologize about that

31:24.440 --> 31:26.440
But we're going to do it one hour earlier

31:26.440 --> 31:27.440
So hopefully we can get a decent turnout

31:27.440 --> 31:28.440
Because after the show

31:28.440 --> 31:30.440
And this is why we're doing it one hour earlier

31:30.440 --> 31:32.440
We're going to team up with the mumble room

31:32.440 --> 31:34.440
We're going to try to recruit as many people

31:34.440 --> 31:35.440
In the mumble room as possible

31:35.440 --> 31:37.440
And we're going to hunt for the best moments

31:37.440 --> 31:40.440
Of Jupiter Broadcasting throughout 2014

31:40.440 --> 31:41.440
Because our idea is

31:41.440 --> 31:43.440
Our hope is to give all of the hosts

31:43.440 --> 31:45.440
Everyone the week of Christmas off

31:45.440 --> 31:46.440
And the only way to do that

31:46.440 --> 31:49.440
Is if we can generate some best of content now

31:49.440 --> 31:50.440
And the only way to go through that

31:50.440 --> 31:52.440
Is if we all work together as a team

31:52.440 --> 31:53.440
We'll sit down

31:53.440 --> 31:54.440
We'll divide up the work

31:54.440 --> 31:55.440
We'll communicate

31:55.440 --> 31:56.440
We'll get a real time doc and form

31:56.440 --> 31:57.440
That you'll be able to fill out

31:57.440 --> 31:59.440
So we'll all be collaborating off the same set of notes

31:59.440 --> 32:01.440
We'll work together as a team

32:01.440 --> 32:03.440
Rekai will be joining us to go through

32:03.440 --> 32:04.440
So he can be here for editing notes

32:04.440 --> 32:06.440
And we're going to try to go through

32:06.440 --> 32:07.440
And discover some of the greatest moments

32:07.440 --> 32:09.440
So if you've got some in your head

32:09.440 --> 32:11.440
We'll have the form available

32:11.440 --> 32:12.440
Probably later in the week

32:12.440 --> 32:14.440
I'll try to make it available during

32:14.440 --> 32:15.440
The Linux Action Show

32:15.440 --> 32:16.440
Or something like that

32:16.440 --> 32:18.440
So keep an eye out for that

32:18.440 --> 32:20.440
I'll probably tweet it out when we have it done

32:20.440 --> 32:22.440
But it'd be great if you could join us next Tuesday

32:22.440 --> 32:23.440
At 1pm Pacific

32:23.440 --> 32:25.440
And help us hunt for all of that stuff

32:25.440 --> 32:27.440
Also, I should probably mention at this point too

32:27.440 --> 32:29.440
There is a Jupiter Broadcasting Polo

32:29.440 --> 32:30.440
A lot of you have asked for it

32:30.440 --> 32:31.440
And this is the one to get

32:31.440 --> 32:34.440
This is something that we worked tirelessly with Teespring

32:34.440 --> 32:35.440
To make sure it's going to be perfect

32:35.440 --> 32:37.440
It's an embroidered Jupiter Broadcasting Polo

32:37.440 --> 32:40.440
And you can find it at teespring.com slash jbpolo

32:40.440 --> 32:41.440
There's a couple of different colors

32:41.440 --> 32:43.440
And they've also added now the Ladies Tea

32:43.440 --> 32:44.440
Which is nice

32:44.440 --> 32:45.440
It's really nice

32:45.440 --> 32:46.440
So you can check that out

32:46.440 --> 32:48.440
Teespring.com slash jbpolo

32:48.440 --> 32:50.440
Oh, I like that grey a lot

32:50.440 --> 32:53.440
That is slick

32:53.440 --> 32:54.440
Snazzy

32:54.440 --> 32:55.440
Yes, very snazzy

32:55.440 --> 32:57.440
Oh my gosh, it's going to look so good

32:57.440 --> 32:58.440
With the white embroidered logo

32:58.440 --> 33:00.440
Teespring.com slash jbpolo

33:00.440 --> 33:01.440
Get your polo on

33:01.440 --> 33:02.440
Or give away some as a gift

33:02.440 --> 33:04.440
We've got more at jupiter.gift

33:04.440 --> 33:06.440
More shirts and stuff too

33:06.440 --> 33:07.440
But yeah, so a little bit of business

33:07.440 --> 33:08.440
J.B. Polo's out

33:08.440 --> 33:11.440
And also our early next week

33:11.440 --> 33:12.440
And we're going to need your help

33:12.440 --> 33:15.440
We will be recruiting as many of you as possible

33:15.440 --> 33:18.440
Okay, so now on to the Debian stuff

33:18.440 --> 33:21.440
This week we've seen some more resignations

33:21.440 --> 33:23.440
From some pretty important folks

33:23.440 --> 33:24.440
In the Debian project

33:24.440 --> 33:26.440
And this isn't the first round we've seen either

33:26.440 --> 33:29.440
And they all seem to be generally

33:29.440 --> 33:31.440
And anybody, if you disagree with me, speak up

33:31.440 --> 33:33.440
No hard feelings

33:33.440 --> 33:36.440
But they all seem to be related to the tone

33:36.440 --> 33:37.440
Of the System D discussion

33:37.440 --> 33:40.440
But not because of System D

33:40.440 --> 33:42.440
Would everybody kind of agree with that?

33:42.440 --> 33:43.440
Yeah

33:43.440 --> 33:46.440
Yeah, I think it's mostly the bureaucracy around Debian

33:46.440 --> 33:49.440
Yeah, so we've had resignations

33:49.440 --> 33:51.440
From the Debian technical committee

33:51.440 --> 33:54.440
We've had resignations from one of the

33:54.440 --> 33:56.440
System D package maintainers

33:56.440 --> 33:58.440
From the package maintaining team for System D

33:58.440 --> 33:59.440
We've had a resignation there

33:59.440 --> 34:03.440
Bruce Perins, a former Debian project leader

34:03.440 --> 34:05.440
Commented on LWN about System D

34:05.440 --> 34:08.440
And about the hostile politics around it

34:08.440 --> 34:10.440
And it's been

34:10.440 --> 34:12.440
What appears to be in most cases

34:12.440 --> 34:14.440
People are sort of re-evaluating

34:14.440 --> 34:15.440
Their life priorities

34:15.440 --> 34:16.440
And deciding

34:16.440 --> 34:18.440
I am not putting up with this anymore

34:18.440 --> 34:19.440
They're being harassed

34:19.440 --> 34:20.440
They're being attacked

34:20.440 --> 34:22.440
Because of their position

34:22.440 --> 34:23.440
Or involvement with either

34:23.440 --> 34:25.440
Whatever aspect of this process

34:25.440 --> 34:28.440
And it's really kind of a sad thing to see happen

34:28.440 --> 34:32.440
Watching people who are contributing

34:32.440 --> 34:34.440
Their time and their energy

34:34.440 --> 34:35.440
To free software

34:35.440 --> 34:36.440
Be attacked

34:36.440 --> 34:38.440
For working on free software

34:38.440 --> 34:40.440
And I don't know what the levels of attacks are

34:40.440 --> 34:42.440
But it's such a hard thing to watch

34:42.440 --> 34:44.440
And I think it represents

34:44.440 --> 34:47.440
Sort of this really hostile tone

34:47.440 --> 34:49.440
That our conversations in the community

34:49.440 --> 34:51.440
Have taken over these things

34:51.440 --> 34:52.440
And it

34:52.440 --> 34:53.440
I don't know

34:53.440 --> 34:54.440
I don't think you could blame System D

34:54.440 --> 34:56.440
System D seems to be the catalyst around it

34:56.440 --> 34:58.440
Matt, are you seeing what I'm seeing?

34:58.440 --> 35:00.440
I'm seeing bits and pieces of it

35:00.440 --> 35:01.440
It's a little bit like

35:01.440 --> 35:03.440
When you're walking through a war zone

35:03.440 --> 35:04.440
And little bits of shrapnel

35:04.440 --> 35:05.440
Are buzzing by your head

35:05.440 --> 35:07.440
So that's been more my experience of it

35:07.440 --> 35:09.440
I don't know the deep details

35:09.440 --> 35:10.440
But it does seem like

35:10.440 --> 35:12.440
That it has been escalating

35:12.440 --> 35:14.440
And at the end of the day

35:14.440 --> 35:16.440
I feel badly for these guys

35:16.440 --> 35:18.440
But I think it is going to be a matter of

35:18.440 --> 35:20.440
Finally, they're going to end up

35:20.440 --> 35:22.440
With an echo chamber of like-minded people

35:22.440 --> 35:23.440
To keep this up

35:23.440 --> 35:25.440
All the people that disagree

35:25.440 --> 35:26.440
See things differently

35:26.440 --> 35:27.440
Alright, Dare Devlin

35:27.440 --> 35:29.440
So you specifically

35:29.440 --> 35:31.440
Focusing on the Debian aspect

35:31.440 --> 35:33.440
Of these latest fallouts

35:33.440 --> 35:35.440
You think it's maybe a symptom

35:35.440 --> 35:36.440
Of getting too big?

35:36.440 --> 35:38.440
Too bureaucratic?

35:38.440 --> 35:40.440
No, I actually think

35:40.440 --> 35:42.440
It's particularly

35:42.440 --> 35:44.440
To the tone

35:44.440 --> 35:46.440
So the bureaucracy

35:46.440 --> 35:48.440
I guess these people were fine with it

35:48.440 --> 35:50.440
So far they've been able to get

35:50.440 --> 35:51.440
Through situations

35:51.440 --> 35:53.440
Through this bureaucratic process

35:53.440 --> 35:55.440
It seems to me that it's rather

35:55.440 --> 35:57.440
The tone that was passed on

35:57.440 --> 35:59.440
The bureaucratic systems lately

35:59.440 --> 36:01.440
Like, you should do this

36:01.440 --> 36:02.440
Which was never the case

36:02.440 --> 36:04.440
It was up to the maintainers

36:04.440 --> 36:06.440
And suddenly there's decisions being made

36:06.440 --> 36:08.440
And the maintainers are just taking

36:08.440 --> 36:10.440
Quote-unquote orders

36:10.440 --> 36:12.440
And in a position of

36:12.440 --> 36:13.440
If you don't like it

36:13.440 --> 36:14.440
Just drop it

36:14.440 --> 36:18.440
One of the more poignant comments

36:18.440 --> 36:20.440
That I saw was Bruce's

36:20.440 --> 36:22.440
The former Debian project leader

36:22.440 --> 36:23.440
And really what he said is

36:23.440 --> 36:25.440
Internally inside Debian

36:25.440 --> 36:27.440
They've lost empathy

36:27.440 --> 36:29.440
Towards the end user

36:29.440 --> 36:32.440
He said that it's sort of like this

36:32.440 --> 36:34.440
It's sort of become this

36:34.440 --> 36:37.440
Cold, calculated system

36:37.440 --> 36:39.440
And it doesn't take into account

36:39.440 --> 36:41.440
The fact that there are certain things

36:41.440 --> 36:42.440
That end users care about

36:42.440 --> 36:43.440
And there are certain things

36:43.440 --> 36:45.440
That end users couldn't care less about

36:45.440 --> 36:47.440
And I wonder if

36:47.440 --> 36:49.440
If this is

36:49.440 --> 36:51.440
And I hate to think about it like this

36:51.440 --> 36:53.440
But is this the result when

36:53.440 --> 36:55.440
You sort of have a

36:55.440 --> 36:57.440
Quote-unquote democracy-type style

36:57.440 --> 36:59.440
Leadership for a distribution

36:59.440 --> 37:01.440
So let me explain why I think this

37:01.440 --> 37:03.440
Before I dig myself too deep into a hole

37:03.440 --> 37:05.440
Arch

37:05.440 --> 37:07.440
Here's how Arch made the transition

37:07.440 --> 37:08.440
To System D

37:08.440 --> 37:09.440
Hey guys, we're thinking about doing this

37:09.440 --> 37:10.440
There was some turmoil

37:10.440 --> 37:11.440
They said okay, well here's what we'll do

37:11.440 --> 37:13.440
We'll support both systems

37:13.440 --> 37:15.440
As long as there's somebody that maintains

37:15.440 --> 37:17.440
The init scripts and all the stuff

37:17.440 --> 37:18.440
For each system

37:18.440 --> 37:20.440
And then when that ends

37:20.440 --> 37:22.440
Then we'll just transition to one system

37:22.440 --> 37:23.440
And that's exactly what happened

37:23.440 --> 37:24.440
People stopped making scripts

37:24.440 --> 37:25.440
For the old system

37:25.440 --> 37:26.440
And they transitioned entirely

37:26.440 --> 37:27.440
Over to System D

37:27.440 --> 37:29.440
And it happened fairly soon

37:29.440 --> 37:31.440
And in fact, because they did it so orderly

37:31.440 --> 37:33.440
I don't know the details on this

37:33.440 --> 37:35.440
But I think

37:35.440 --> 37:36.440
Unless maybe someone in the Mumba Room

37:36.440 --> 37:37.440
Has told me this, I think

37:37.440 --> 37:39.440
One of the guys at Arch

37:39.440 --> 37:41.440
Now works on System D

37:41.440 --> 37:43.440
For his full-time gig

37:43.440 --> 37:45.440
Because they really did such a professional

37:45.440 --> 37:47.440
Job of transitioning over to this

37:47.440 --> 37:49.440
And I think that might be because

37:49.440 --> 37:50.440
Arch essentially is controlled

37:50.440 --> 37:52.440
By a small group of developers

37:52.440 --> 37:53.440
And they just make a decision

37:53.440 --> 37:54.440
And they go for it, right?

37:54.440 --> 37:56.440
And other distributions have people

37:56.440 --> 37:57.440
That just make, you know

37:57.440 --> 37:58.440
Mark Shuttleworth makes a blog post

37:58.440 --> 37:59.440
And says alright, yep

37:59.440 --> 38:00.440
Well now we're going to System D

38:00.440 --> 38:01.440
And I'm sure there was

38:01.440 --> 38:02.440
Internal discussions about it

38:02.440 --> 38:03.440
But once it's declared

38:03.440 --> 38:04.440
It's declared

38:04.440 --> 38:06.440
And I know I've raised this point before

38:06.440 --> 38:08.440
But it seems like every few years

38:08.440 --> 38:09.440
And this is the worst one

38:09.440 --> 38:10.440
I think I've ever seen

38:10.440 --> 38:12.440
Debian goes through these many implosions

38:12.440 --> 38:14.440
And I look at this and I think

38:14.440 --> 38:15.440
This has to just be

38:15.440 --> 38:16.440
Because as human beings

38:16.440 --> 38:17.440
We're just not very good

38:17.440 --> 38:18.440
At this kind of thing

38:20.440 --> 38:21.440
Boy, you know

38:21.440 --> 38:22.440
The more I think about it

38:22.440 --> 38:23.440
I think really when you compare

38:23.440 --> 38:25.440
Arch and the Debian communities

38:25.440 --> 38:27.440
I honestly think back to the

38:27.440 --> 38:28.440
Introduction to Buck Rogers

38:28.440 --> 38:29.440
The intro that showed

38:29.440 --> 38:30.440
Where it has all the things

38:30.440 --> 38:31.440
Happening through time

38:31.440 --> 38:32.440
That's how I see Debian

38:32.440 --> 38:33.440
In a lot of ways

38:33.440 --> 38:34.440
I feel like that, as you said

38:34.440 --> 38:35.440
They have many implosions

38:35.440 --> 38:37.440
But I also think the fact is

38:37.440 --> 38:38.440
That there's a lot of ego

38:38.440 --> 38:40.440
That floats around in that circle

38:40.440 --> 38:42.440
Arch users honestly like Arch

38:42.440 --> 38:43.440
Or go away

38:43.440 --> 38:44.440
They don't care

38:44.440 --> 38:45.440
You know, I've never really

38:45.440 --> 38:46.440
Got a sense of ego

38:46.440 --> 38:47.440
From the Arch community

38:47.440 --> 38:48.440
That I've gotten

38:48.440 --> 38:49.440
From other distributions

38:49.440 --> 38:50.440
And so that may play a part too

38:50.440 --> 38:51.440
To where, you know

38:51.440 --> 38:52.440
Yes, it was just stated

38:52.440 --> 38:53.440
This is what we're doing

38:53.440 --> 38:54.440
Like it, lump it, or leave

38:54.440 --> 38:56.440
And the Debian people are like

38:56.440 --> 38:57.440
Well, you know

38:57.440 --> 38:58.440
We've got to have this big community

38:58.440 --> 38:59.440
Think about it

38:59.440 --> 39:00.440
And blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

39:00.440 --> 39:01.440
But I do feel like there's a lot

39:01.440 --> 39:02.440
Of ego stroking

39:02.440 --> 39:03.440
Going back and forth

39:03.440 --> 39:04.440
I don't know

39:04.440 --> 39:05.440
Am I wrong?

39:05.440 --> 39:06.440
Well, Derrick Delvin

39:06.440 --> 39:07.440
Do you think it could be

39:07.440 --> 39:08.440
That it's more of a

39:08.440 --> 39:09.440
Hey, I didn't sign up

39:09.440 --> 39:10.440
For this kind of mentality?

39:10.440 --> 39:11.440
Yes, I didn't sign up

39:11.440 --> 39:12.440
For doing the work

39:12.440 --> 39:13.440
For that particular thing

39:13.440 --> 39:14.440
And now suddenly

39:14.440 --> 39:15.440
There is that expectation

39:15.440 --> 39:16.440
In the past

39:16.440 --> 39:18.440
That's not how it was done

39:18.440 --> 39:19.440
In Debian

39:19.440 --> 39:20.440
It was up to the maintainers

39:20.440 --> 39:22.440
And now this is being moved up

39:22.440 --> 39:24.440
To the who's ever leading

39:24.440 --> 39:26.440
And the folks are just saying

39:26.440 --> 39:27.440
Okay, I'm going to drop it

39:27.440 --> 39:28.440
So it is a little

39:28.440 --> 39:29.440
It's like

39:29.440 --> 39:31.440
It's egos combined

39:31.440 --> 39:33.440
With a bureaucratic structure

39:33.440 --> 39:34.440
Mixed with people

39:34.440 --> 39:35.440
Who are like

39:35.440 --> 39:36.440
Well, this isn't what I signed up for

39:36.440 --> 39:37.440
I don't want to do this

39:37.440 --> 39:38.440
And all of these things

39:38.440 --> 39:39.440
Come together

39:39.440 --> 39:40.440
And you have a toxic situation

39:40.440 --> 39:41.440
Now here is the

39:41.440 --> 39:42.440
Here's where I want to move

39:42.440 --> 39:43.440
The discussion towards

39:43.440 --> 39:45.440
I still maintain

39:45.440 --> 39:46.440
That I think

39:46.440 --> 39:48.440
A fanning of the flames

39:48.440 --> 39:50.440
And I think that's putting it

39:50.440 --> 39:51.440
Very generously

39:51.440 --> 39:52.440
I would almost say

39:52.440 --> 39:53.440
Throwing fuel on the fire

39:53.440 --> 39:54.440
Is a more inapt analogy

39:54.440 --> 39:55.440
Is the quote, unquote

39:55.440 --> 39:57.440
Open source tech press

39:57.440 --> 39:59.440
Who has fueled these battles

39:59.440 --> 40:00.440
To drive clicks

40:00.440 --> 40:02.440
And I still believe

40:02.440 --> 40:03.440
That it's sort of like

40:03.440 --> 40:04.440
This secular cycle

40:04.440 --> 40:06.440
Where the news

40:06.440 --> 40:07.440
The tech, quote, unquote

40:07.440 --> 40:08.440
Bloggers and press

40:08.440 --> 40:09.440
Write about this

40:09.440 --> 40:10.440
That almost sort of

40:10.440 --> 40:11.440
Becomes reality

40:11.440 --> 40:12.440
And what it does is

40:12.440 --> 40:13.440
It moves the goal post

40:13.440 --> 40:14.440
Of the conversation

40:14.440 --> 40:15.440
So it changes the tone

40:15.440 --> 40:17.440
To be much more dramatic

40:17.440 --> 40:18.440
Much more decisive

40:18.440 --> 40:19.440
Much more amped up

40:19.440 --> 40:21.440
It makes these community discussions

40:21.440 --> 40:22.440
Turned into reality

40:22.440 --> 40:23.440
Television shows

40:23.440 --> 40:24.440
For the web

40:24.440 --> 40:25.440
Is what it does

40:25.440 --> 40:26.440
And when it does that

40:26.440 --> 40:28.440
It moves the tone of the dialogue

40:28.440 --> 40:29.440
In that community

40:29.440 --> 40:30.440
It moves that forward

40:30.440 --> 40:32.440
Into a more aggressive tone

40:32.440 --> 40:33.440
And it begins to reflect

40:33.440 --> 40:34.440
The very thing

40:34.440 --> 40:35.440
They are writing about

40:35.440 --> 40:37.440
Have we not all seen this?

40:37.440 --> 40:38.440
And so once again

40:38.440 --> 40:39.440
Don't we come back to

40:39.440 --> 40:40.440
The tech press

40:40.440 --> 40:42.440
Has a responsibility here

40:42.440 --> 40:43.440
To get the story right

40:43.440 --> 40:45.440
And to stop over blowing

40:45.440 --> 40:46.440
All of these things

40:46.440 --> 40:48.440
That fan these problems

40:48.440 --> 40:49.440
And now

40:49.440 --> 40:50.440
I think you could attribute

40:50.440 --> 40:51.440
Some of that

40:51.440 --> 40:52.440
To causing major strife

40:52.440 --> 40:53.440
Inside a critically important

40:53.440 --> 40:57.440
Linux distribution

40:57.440 --> 40:58.440
What do you think

40:58.440 --> 40:59.440
Dear Devlin?

40:59.440 --> 41:00.440
I think that

41:00.440 --> 41:03.440
That does have an influence

41:03.440 --> 41:04.440
And perhaps we could

41:04.440 --> 41:05.440
I'm not saying like

41:05.440 --> 41:07.440
It's just a suggestion

41:07.440 --> 41:08.440
Try to invite

41:08.440 --> 41:10.440
When we see something

41:10.440 --> 41:11.440
Instead of the first thing

41:11.440 --> 41:12.440
Be comment about it

41:12.440 --> 41:14.440
Just actually invite someone

41:14.440 --> 41:15.440
That is participating

41:15.440 --> 41:17.440
On the actual process

41:17.440 --> 41:18.440
Right so

41:18.440 --> 41:19.440
If they're willing

41:19.440 --> 41:20.440
To come up with that

41:20.440 --> 41:21.440
This was my thought

41:21.440 --> 41:22.440
Is like

41:22.440 --> 41:23.440
There must be something

41:23.440 --> 41:25.440
We could just do ourselves

41:25.440 --> 41:27.440
Something that has to be done

41:27.440 --> 41:28.440
That could be

41:28.440 --> 41:29.440
Our contribution

41:29.440 --> 41:30.440
Something that we could

41:30.440 --> 41:31.440
Figure out

41:31.440 --> 41:32.440
To move the tone back

41:32.440 --> 41:33.440
Into a more

41:33.440 --> 41:34.440
Merit-based conversation

41:34.440 --> 41:36.440
Where it's technicalities

41:36.440 --> 41:37.440
And there is room

41:37.440 --> 41:38.440
For philosophy

41:38.440 --> 41:40.440
But it's not a war

41:40.440 --> 41:41.440
It's not a holy war

41:41.440 --> 41:43.440
It needs to be a space

41:43.440 --> 41:45.440
Where it's perfectly fine

41:45.440 --> 41:47.440
That I think plasma TVs

41:47.440 --> 41:49.440
Are better than LCD TVs

41:49.440 --> 41:51.440
And you think LCD TVs

41:51.440 --> 41:52.440
Are better than plasma TVs

41:52.440 --> 41:53.440
And that's great

41:53.440 --> 41:54.440
And we're both happy

41:54.440 --> 41:55.440
With our choices

41:55.440 --> 41:56.440
And that's fine

41:56.440 --> 41:57.440
Like we need to be able

41:57.440 --> 41:58.440
To have those kinds

41:58.440 --> 41:59.440
Of conversations

41:59.440 --> 42:00.440
Where when somebody says

42:00.440 --> 42:01.440
I think chrome

42:01.440 --> 42:02.440
Is better than Firefox

42:02.440 --> 42:04.440
Instead of having a battle

42:04.440 --> 42:05.440
And calling somebody

42:05.440 --> 42:06.440
Uneducated or saying

42:06.440 --> 42:07.440
They don't know how

42:07.440 --> 42:08.440
To use computers

42:08.440 --> 42:09.440
It's like oh that's interesting

42:09.440 --> 42:10.440
Now I find that

42:10.440 --> 42:11.440
Chrome might be better

42:11.440 --> 42:12.440
For me because of this

42:12.440 --> 42:13.440
Kind of like we've started

42:13.440 --> 42:14.440
Now do you know

42:14.440 --> 42:15.440
Lionhead today

42:15.440 --> 42:16.440
He reported on his

42:16.440 --> 42:17.440
Chromium experiment

42:17.440 --> 42:18.440
We didn't jump on him

42:18.440 --> 42:19.440
Those of us who think

42:19.440 --> 42:20.440
Chromium is better

42:20.440 --> 42:21.440
We're like okay great

42:21.440 --> 42:22.440
Glad you gave it a shot

42:22.440 --> 42:23.440
Thanks man

42:23.440 --> 42:24.440
Thanks for the feedback

42:24.440 --> 42:25.440
And that I think

42:25.440 --> 42:26.440
Is more valuable discussion

42:26.440 --> 42:27.440
So the question is

42:27.440 --> 42:28.440
Is what can we do

42:28.440 --> 42:29.440
To sort of encourage

42:29.440 --> 42:30.440
That everywhere

42:30.440 --> 42:31.440
What can we do

42:31.440 --> 42:32.440
With the base level

42:32.440 --> 42:33.440
And my thought was that too

42:33.440 --> 42:34.440
Is like maybe we could

42:34.440 --> 42:35.440
Bring more people on

42:35.440 --> 42:36.440
But the thing is

42:36.440 --> 42:37.440
That's easier said

42:37.440 --> 42:38.440
Than done to be honest

42:38.440 --> 42:39.440
These are people

42:39.440 --> 42:40.440
That are working

42:40.440 --> 42:41.440
They're in different time zones

42:41.440 --> 42:42.440
Sometimes they don't

42:42.440 --> 42:43.440
Speak English

42:43.440 --> 42:44.440
There's a lot of problems

42:44.440 --> 42:45.440
In that

42:45.440 --> 42:46.440
But I agree

42:46.440 --> 42:47.440
That could be one thing

42:47.440 --> 42:48.440
We could do

42:48.440 --> 42:49.440
We could also

42:49.440 --> 42:50.440
Actually reporting it

42:50.440 --> 42:51.440
To get more context

42:51.440 --> 42:53.440
Let it run first

42:53.440 --> 42:54.440
Then report it

42:54.440 --> 42:55.440
And actually have a comment

42:55.440 --> 42:57.440
And I think we do actually

42:57.440 --> 42:58.440
Here on this show

42:58.440 --> 42:59.440
I think we do do that

42:59.440 --> 43:00.440
Fairly well

43:00.440 --> 43:01.440
And so I want to make sure

43:01.440 --> 43:02.440
It's like

43:02.440 --> 43:03.440
What I was thinking

43:03.440 --> 43:04.440
So I wrote down a couple ideas

43:04.440 --> 43:05.440
And you guys tell me

43:05.440 --> 43:07.440
What you think of this

43:07.440 --> 43:08.440
Maybe we could utilize

43:08.440 --> 43:09.440
Something like Hangouts

43:09.440 --> 43:11.440
And do round table discussions

43:11.440 --> 43:12.440
Where we'd bring on

43:12.440 --> 43:13.440
Several people

43:13.440 --> 43:14.440
Like a counter point

43:14.440 --> 43:16.440
Point counter point discussion

43:16.440 --> 43:17.440
And you know

43:17.440 --> 43:19.440
We try to keep it civil

43:19.440 --> 43:20.440
I don't know how exactly

43:20.440 --> 43:21.440
We'd pull that off

43:21.440 --> 43:22.440
In timing wise

43:22.440 --> 43:24.440
But it could just be like

43:24.440 --> 43:25.440
People we could make

43:25.440 --> 43:26.440
We could send out invitations

43:26.440 --> 43:27.440
Say hey we'd like to have

43:27.440 --> 43:28.440
A nice civil discussion

43:28.440 --> 43:29.440
About this

43:29.440 --> 43:30.440
And then people

43:30.440 --> 43:31.440
And then

43:31.440 --> 43:32.440
What would be the ideal

43:32.440 --> 43:33.440
Output of that

43:33.440 --> 43:34.440
Would be a video

43:34.440 --> 43:35.440
That when the

43:35.440 --> 43:36.440
When the debate comes up

43:36.440 --> 43:37.440
On Reddit or on some form

43:37.440 --> 43:38.440
Or in an IRC room

43:38.440 --> 43:39.440
Or wherever these debates happen

43:39.440 --> 43:40.440
You could send somebody

43:40.440 --> 43:41.440
That YouTube link

43:41.440 --> 43:42.440
And be like yeah

43:42.440 --> 43:43.440
These guys

43:43.440 --> 43:44.440
Discuss this here

43:44.440 --> 43:45.440
And you know

43:45.440 --> 43:46.440
This is a pretty good

43:46.440 --> 43:47.440
Point counter point discussion

43:47.440 --> 43:48.440
So that was one idea

43:48.440 --> 43:49.440
I had

43:49.440 --> 43:50.440
But it

43:50.440 --> 43:51.440
That is not an easy thing

43:51.440 --> 43:52.440
To do

43:52.440 --> 43:53.440
To schedule these people

43:53.440 --> 43:54.440
In the different time zones

43:54.440 --> 43:55.440
And organize all of that

43:55.440 --> 43:56.440
So it's

43:56.440 --> 43:57.440
It might be a little pie

43:57.440 --> 43:58.440
In the sky

43:58.440 --> 43:59.440
Go ahead

43:59.440 --> 44:00.440
What I think

44:00.440 --> 44:03.440
What's fueling this

44:03.440 --> 44:04.440
What's it called

44:04.440 --> 44:05.440
System D debate

44:05.440 --> 44:07.440
Is prejudiced

44:07.440 --> 44:08.440
People

44:08.440 --> 44:09.440
People don't think

44:09.440 --> 44:10.440
System D before actually

44:10.440 --> 44:11.440
Using it

44:11.440 --> 44:12.440
Sure

44:12.440 --> 44:13.440
I'm sure there's a little

44:13.440 --> 44:14.440
Prejudice and predetermination

44:14.440 --> 44:15.440
In it

44:15.440 --> 44:16.440
But it's

44:16.440 --> 44:17.440
It's a mix of stuff

44:17.440 --> 44:18.440
And there's

44:18.440 --> 44:19.440
Because scheduling

44:19.440 --> 44:20.440
Sorry I was just going to say

44:20.440 --> 44:21.440
Besides scheduling

44:21.440 --> 44:22.440
Scheduling things live

44:22.440 --> 44:23.440
Is very difficult

44:23.440 --> 44:24.920
Especially with multiple individuals

44:24.920 --> 44:25.920
Why not have like

44:25.920 --> 44:27.920
A group email thread

44:27.920 --> 44:29.180
Where those people can reply

44:29.180 --> 44:31.200
To each other in a timely fashion

44:31.200 --> 44:32.520
And that can be summarized

44:32.520 --> 44:34.240
On say Linux unplugged

44:34.240 --> 44:35.440
It's pretty boring

44:35.440 --> 44:36.440
For the end

44:36.440 --> 44:38.080
For the listener

44:38.080 --> 44:39.080
But it's definitely

44:39.080 --> 44:40.080
Something

44:40.080 --> 44:41.080
It's already happening

44:41.080 --> 44:42.080
It's yeah

44:42.080 --> 44:43.080
Yeah

44:43.080 --> 44:44.080
And that might be

44:44.080 --> 44:45.080
Chris has not mentioned something

44:45.080 --> 44:46.080
Yes

44:46.080 --> 44:47.080
So

44:47.080 --> 44:49.920
So I have a different view

44:49.920 --> 44:50.920
On the matter

44:50.920 --> 44:51.920
Okay

44:51.920 --> 44:52.920
Actually not everything is

44:52.920 --> 44:53.920
Technical

44:53.920 --> 44:54.920
And of course

44:54.920 --> 44:56.880
System D is superior

44:56.880 --> 44:58.440
And it does things better

44:58.440 --> 44:59.440
And so on

44:59.440 --> 45:00.440
And we can praise it

45:00.440 --> 45:01.440
All day long

45:01.440 --> 45:02.440
But it's not only about that

45:02.440 --> 45:03.440
There's also a philosophical

45:03.440 --> 45:06.880
Or a belief based

45:06.880 --> 45:07.880
Right

45:07.880 --> 45:08.880
Opinion here

45:08.880 --> 45:09.880
Right

45:09.880 --> 45:10.880
And this is actually

45:10.880 --> 45:11.880
This is the same with

45:11.880 --> 45:13.920
Chrome versus Firefox as well

45:13.920 --> 45:14.920
This is why

45:14.920 --> 45:15.920
But

45:15.920 --> 45:16.920
Not to interrupt

45:16.920 --> 45:17.920
Before you go too much further

45:17.920 --> 45:18.920
I just want to say

45:18.920 --> 45:19.920
This is actually

45:19.920 --> 45:20.920
You're making the point

45:20.920 --> 45:21.920
This is why

45:21.920 --> 45:22.920
And skookiesbrights also

45:22.920 --> 45:23.920
Mentioned the chat room

45:23.920 --> 45:24.920
This is why I was thinking

45:24.920 --> 45:25.920
Instead of an email thread

45:25.920 --> 45:26.920
A hangout or whatever

45:26.920 --> 45:27.920
It would be web RTC session

45:27.920 --> 45:28.920
Or whatever is better

45:28.920 --> 45:29.920
Because what we have

45:29.920 --> 45:30.920
Happen a lot

45:30.920 --> 45:31.920
Is people start talking

45:31.920 --> 45:32.920
Philosophies across

45:32.920 --> 45:33.920
Each other's faces

45:33.920 --> 45:34.920
They're not talking

45:34.920 --> 45:35.920
To each other

45:35.920 --> 45:36.920
They talk across

45:36.920 --> 45:37.920
To each other

45:37.920 --> 45:38.920
About philosophy

45:38.920 --> 45:39.920
And things like that

45:39.920 --> 45:40.920
And the conversations

45:40.920 --> 45:41.920
Go totally on

45:41.920 --> 45:42.920
To deaf ears

45:42.920 --> 45:43.920
And so if they talk

45:43.920 --> 45:45.920
Then that would be something

45:45.920 --> 45:46.920
When people engage directly

45:46.920 --> 45:47.920
With each other

45:47.920 --> 45:48.920
They're more civil

45:48.920 --> 45:49.920
And they listen

45:49.920 --> 45:50.920
A little bit better

45:50.920 --> 45:51.920
Instead of having to

45:51.920 --> 45:52.920
Read a wall of text

45:52.920 --> 45:53.920
What do you think?

45:53.920 --> 45:54.920
Of course

45:54.920 --> 45:55.920
I absolutely agree with this

45:55.920 --> 45:56.920
But my point was actually

45:56.920 --> 45:57.920
About

45:57.920 --> 45:58.920
You know

45:58.920 --> 45:59.920
Attacking developers

45:59.920 --> 46:00.920
Due to

46:00.920 --> 46:01.920
Or developers essentially

46:01.920 --> 46:02.920
Resigning from their positions

46:02.920 --> 46:03.920
Because of

46:03.920 --> 46:04.920
A problem like that

46:04.920 --> 46:05.920
Of debates going on

46:05.920 --> 46:06.920
Like that

46:06.920 --> 46:07.920
And what I wanted to mention

46:07.920 --> 46:08.920
Was

46:08.920 --> 46:09.920
It's the same

46:09.920 --> 46:10.920
You experienced

46:10.920 --> 46:11.920
That

46:11.920 --> 46:13.920
When you say you know

46:13.920 --> 46:14.920
I prefer Chrome

46:14.920 --> 46:15.920
Because it works

46:15.920 --> 46:16.920
So much better

46:16.920 --> 46:17.920
And so on

46:17.920 --> 46:18.920
You're right

46:18.920 --> 46:19.920
Chrome does work

46:19.920 --> 46:20.920
Much better

46:20.920 --> 46:21.920
In a lot of cases

46:21.920 --> 46:22.920
A lot more than Firefox

46:22.920 --> 46:23.920
And systemd does a lot better

46:23.920 --> 46:24.920
Than sysv

46:24.920 --> 46:25.920
And its scripts

46:25.920 --> 46:26.920
But

46:26.920 --> 46:27.920
There is

46:27.920 --> 46:28.920
The philosophical side

46:28.920 --> 46:29.920
When

46:29.920 --> 46:30.920
I get upset

46:30.920 --> 46:31.920
When you

46:31.920 --> 46:32.920
When I see somebody

46:32.920 --> 46:33.920
Like you

46:33.920 --> 46:34.920
Who really praises

46:34.920 --> 46:35.920
Chrome

46:35.920 --> 46:36.920
That publicly

46:36.920 --> 46:37.920
And

46:37.920 --> 46:38.920
Because

46:38.920 --> 46:39.920
There is

46:39.920 --> 46:40.920
Something called

46:40.920 --> 46:41.920
Market share

46:41.920 --> 46:42.920
And market share is

46:42.920 --> 46:43.920
Information and power

46:43.920 --> 46:44.920
And

46:44.920 --> 46:45.920
We should not be putting

46:45.920 --> 46:46.920
All of our eggs

46:46.920 --> 46:47.920
In one basket

46:47.920 --> 46:48.920
And

46:48.920 --> 46:49.920
So

46:49.920 --> 46:50.920
I personally

46:50.920 --> 46:51.920
I never touch

46:51.920 --> 46:52.920
Chrome

46:52.920 --> 46:53.920
Even if Firefox crashes on me

46:53.920 --> 46:54.920
I just tolerate that

46:54.920 --> 46:55.920
I try to report bugs

46:55.920 --> 46:56.920
I do

46:56.920 --> 46:57.920
Everything I can

46:57.920 --> 46:58.920
Just

46:58.920 --> 46:59.920
Not because it's Firefox

46:59.920 --> 47:00.920
It's not about open web

47:00.920 --> 47:01.920
It's not about

47:01.920 --> 47:02.920
Anything like that

47:02.920 --> 47:03.920
It's just about

47:03.920 --> 47:04.920
Preventing a monoculture

47:04.920 --> 47:05.920
Right

47:05.920 --> 47:06.920
You don't want a monoculture

47:06.920 --> 47:07.920
In web browsers

47:07.920 --> 47:08.920
Yeah absolutely

47:08.920 --> 47:09.920
That's why I took the

47:09.920 --> 47:10.920
So this

47:10.920 --> 47:11.920
Sort of segues

47:11.920 --> 47:12.920
To my next thought

47:12.920 --> 47:13.920
Is maybe

47:13.920 --> 47:14.920
Instead of

47:14.920 --> 47:15.920
Trying to

47:15.920 --> 47:16.920
House discussions

47:16.920 --> 47:17.920
Maybe what we should

47:17.920 --> 47:18.920
Try to do

47:18.920 --> 47:19.920
Is hyper focus on ways

47:19.920 --> 47:20.920
To get people more involved

47:20.920 --> 47:21.920
With open source

47:21.920 --> 47:22.920
So there's more people

47:22.920 --> 47:23.920
Coming in

47:23.920 --> 47:24.920
Instead of

47:24.920 --> 47:25.920
Instead of

47:25.920 --> 47:26.920
Shouting from the

47:26.920 --> 47:27.920
Stadium

47:27.920 --> 47:28.920
At these developers

47:28.920 --> 47:29.920
Let's get more people

47:29.920 --> 47:30.920
In there

47:30.920 --> 47:31.920
Contributing

47:31.920 --> 47:32.920
And maybe instead of

47:32.920 --> 47:33.920
Being commentators

47:33.920 --> 47:34.920
In peanut gallery

47:34.920 --> 47:35.920
They'll actually have

47:35.920 --> 47:36.920
Some skin in the game

47:36.920 --> 47:37.920
And so my thought

47:37.920 --> 47:38.920
On that was

47:38.920 --> 47:39.920
Let's take a project

47:39.920 --> 47:40.920
And say

47:40.920 --> 47:41.920
This

47:41.920 --> 47:42.920
I don't know

47:42.920 --> 47:43.920
Let's just pick

47:43.920 --> 47:44.920
Because I love it

47:44.920 --> 47:45.920
Let's pick the

47:45.920 --> 47:46.920
Geary project

47:46.920 --> 47:47.920
This is the Geary

47:47.920 --> 47:48.920
Email client

47:48.920 --> 47:49.920
This is how you get

47:49.920 --> 47:50.920
Involved specifically

47:50.920 --> 47:51.920
With the Geary project

47:51.920 --> 47:52.920
Maybe we bring on

47:52.920 --> 47:53.920
One of their developers

47:53.920 --> 47:54.920
And ask them

47:54.920 --> 47:55.920
What would be the most

47:55.920 --> 47:56.920
Helpful type of contribution

47:56.920 --> 47:57.920
What would be the way

47:57.920 --> 47:58.920
People can get a hold of you

47:58.920 --> 47:59.920
How do they start

47:59.920 --> 48:00.920
Submitting code

48:00.920 --> 48:01.920
Where should they go to

48:01.920 --> 48:02.920
Submit patches

48:02.920 --> 48:03.920
And things like that

48:03.920 --> 48:04.920
And really give people

48:04.920 --> 48:05.920
Concrete

48:05.920 --> 48:06.920
Like if you want to walk

48:06.920 --> 48:07.920
Away from this episode

48:07.920 --> 48:08.920
Of the open source project

48:08.920 --> 48:09.920
And maybe we can sort of

48:09.920 --> 48:10.920
Get more people involved

48:10.920 --> 48:11.920
In that aspect of it

48:11.920 --> 48:12.920
And get people

48:12.920 --> 48:13.920
Out of the

48:13.920 --> 48:14.920
Playing

48:14.920 --> 48:15.920
You know

48:15.920 --> 48:16.920
Sports commentator

48:16.920 --> 48:17.920
And actually running the ball

48:17.920 --> 48:18.920
Huh?

48:18.920 --> 48:19.920
Look at that analogy

48:19.920 --> 48:20.920
I see what you did there

48:20.920 --> 48:21.920
Sports ball

48:21.920 --> 48:22.920
I don't know

48:22.920 --> 48:23.920
Sports ball

48:23.920 --> 48:24.920
But would that

48:24.920 --> 48:25.920
Actually be appealing though?

48:25.920 --> 48:26.920
I am already

48:26.920 --> 48:27.920
Doing it

48:27.920 --> 48:28.920
It's just

48:28.920 --> 48:29.920
That thing

48:29.920 --> 48:30.920
Like bringing

48:30.920 --> 48:31.920
More people to develop

48:31.920 --> 48:32.920
You need the

48:32.920 --> 48:33.920
One stop shop

48:33.920 --> 48:34.920
That I've been

48:34.920 --> 48:35.920
Talking about

48:35.920 --> 48:36.920
Yeah

48:36.920 --> 48:37.920
If the developers

48:37.920 --> 48:38.920
Don't have that

48:38.920 --> 48:39.920
One stop shop

48:39.920 --> 48:40.920
It's really hard

48:40.920 --> 48:41.920
To introduce someone

48:41.920 --> 48:42.920
Because they have to

48:42.920 --> 48:43.920
Detach from their tools

48:43.920 --> 48:44.920
Or their ways

48:44.920 --> 48:45.920
And there's also like

48:45.920 --> 48:46.920
These

48:46.920 --> 48:47.920
Floating guidance

48:47.920 --> 48:48.920
Right

48:48.920 --> 48:49.920
Right

48:49.920 --> 48:50.920
It's

48:50.920 --> 48:51.920
There's no channel

48:51.920 --> 48:52.920
For them just to get in

48:52.920 --> 48:53.920
And from end to end

48:53.920 --> 48:54.920
This is how you do it

48:54.920 --> 48:55.920
This is something

48:55.920 --> 48:56.920
We've talked about

48:56.920 --> 48:57.920
On Coda Radio

48:57.920 --> 48:58.920
Is when Mike was looking

48:58.920 --> 48:59.920
At writing one of his apps

48:59.920 --> 49:00.920
You know

49:00.920 --> 49:01.920
He's like

49:01.920 --> 49:02.920
Well do I

49:02.920 --> 49:03.920
Go grab the Ubuntu SDK

49:03.920 --> 49:04.920
Do I just go start writing

49:04.920 --> 49:05.920
You know

49:05.920 --> 49:06.920
And he's looking for

49:06.920 --> 49:07.920
Sort of a

49:07.920 --> 49:08.920
This is the path you take

49:08.920 --> 49:09.920
And it doesn't have to be

49:09.920 --> 49:10.920
The only path

49:10.920 --> 49:11.920
But it's sort of like

49:11.920 --> 49:12.920
Here's a pretty solid path

49:12.920 --> 49:13.920
That you're probably

49:13.920 --> 49:14.920
Going to be able to make

49:14.920 --> 49:15.920
A pretty decent app using

49:15.920 --> 49:16.920
And it's not too intimidating

49:16.920 --> 49:17.920
It's well supported

49:17.920 --> 49:18.920
And it's going to get you

49:18.920 --> 49:20.920
On most modern distributions

49:20.920 --> 49:21.920
Like that's really

49:21.920 --> 49:22.920
All we need

49:22.920 --> 49:23.920
We just need something

49:23.920 --> 49:24.920
Kind of like that

49:24.920 --> 49:25.920
There's different things out there

49:25.920 --> 49:26.920
You can absolutely

49:26.920 --> 49:27.920
Put together yourself

49:27.920 --> 49:28.920
No doubt about it

49:28.920 --> 49:29.920
But what the guys

49:29.920 --> 49:30.920
In the Mumbler are saying

49:30.920 --> 49:31.920
And what Michael Dominic

49:31.920 --> 49:32.920
Was saying

49:32.920 --> 49:33.920
Is they don't even know

49:33.920 --> 49:34.920
Where to start there

49:34.920 --> 49:35.920
Because they don't even know

49:35.920 --> 49:36.920
Those things exist

49:36.920 --> 49:37.920
Yeah

49:37.920 --> 49:38.920
I'm actually already

49:38.920 --> 49:39.920
Doing some work

49:39.920 --> 49:40.920
I'm not going to

49:40.920 --> 49:41.920
Advance much about it

49:41.920 --> 49:42.920
But I'm already

49:42.920 --> 49:43.920
Doing some work

49:43.920 --> 49:44.920
And I'm actually

49:44.920 --> 49:45.920
Going to propose

49:45.920 --> 49:46.920
To all the distributions

49:46.920 --> 49:47.920
See if we can get

49:47.920 --> 49:48.920
Some consensus

49:48.920 --> 49:49.920
On getting something going

49:49.920 --> 49:50.920
See this is

49:50.920 --> 49:51.920
A major area

49:51.920 --> 49:52.920
If we could get

49:52.920 --> 49:53.920
More people contributing

49:53.920 --> 49:54.920
Instead of just

49:54.920 --> 49:55.920
Being on the sidelines

49:55.920 --> 49:56.920
I feel like

49:56.920 --> 49:57.920
If we got the right

49:57.920 --> 49:58.920
I don't know

49:58.920 --> 49:59.920
Like that could be

49:59.920 --> 50:00.920
A great way to really

50:00.920 --> 50:01.920
Sort of move things forward

50:01.920 --> 50:02.920
And hopefully

50:02.920 --> 50:03.920
Make a positive impact

50:03.920 --> 50:04.920
So low level

50:04.920 --> 50:05.920
That it

50:05.920 --> 50:06.920
I don't know if it'd be

50:06.920 --> 50:07.920
Community changing

50:07.920 --> 50:08.920
But it would at least

50:08.920 --> 50:09.920
Be putting things

50:09.920 --> 50:10.920
In the right direction

50:10.920 --> 50:11.920
I don't know

50:11.920 --> 50:12.920
It's something I think

50:12.920 --> 50:13.920
We should think more about

50:13.920 --> 50:14.920
And I'd like to get

50:14.920 --> 50:15.920
The audience's thoughts on it

50:15.920 --> 50:16.920
To expand upon that

50:16.920 --> 50:17.920
Go over to

50:17.920 --> 50:18.920
Jupiterbroadcasting.com

50:18.920 --> 50:19.920
Click the contact link

50:19.920 --> 50:20.920
Choose Linux Unplugged

50:20.920 --> 50:21.920
From the drop down

50:21.920 --> 50:22.920
Or we have that

50:22.920 --> 50:23.920
Feedback thread

50:23.920 --> 50:24.920
In the subreddit

50:24.920 --> 50:25.920
Linuxactionshow.reddit.com

50:25.920 --> 50:26.920
You can submit your thoughts there

50:26.920 --> 50:27.920
Any closing thoughts

50:27.920 --> 50:28.920
Mumble room on that topic

50:28.920 --> 50:29.920
Before we move on

50:29.920 --> 50:30.920
Yeah I still

50:30.920 --> 50:31.920
I mentioned

50:31.920 --> 50:32.920
The

50:32.920 --> 50:33.920
Firefox and Chrome thing

50:33.920 --> 50:34.920
And I just wanted to

50:34.920 --> 50:35.920
Like clarify

50:35.920 --> 50:36.920
Why I mentioned

50:36.920 --> 50:37.920
This point

50:37.920 --> 50:38.920
It's

50:38.920 --> 50:39.920
Like you can make

50:39.920 --> 50:40.920
The analogy with

50:40.920 --> 50:41.920
System D and Debian

50:41.920 --> 50:42.920
And Debian is about

50:42.920 --> 50:43.920
You know

50:43.920 --> 50:44.920
It has a history

50:44.920 --> 50:45.920
Of being careful

50:45.920 --> 50:46.920
And doing things slowly

50:46.920 --> 50:47.920
And taking their time

50:47.920 --> 50:48.920
And doing things right

50:48.920 --> 50:49.920
And not screwing up users

50:49.920 --> 50:50.920
And now that you introduce

50:50.920 --> 50:51.920
System D

50:51.920 --> 50:52.920
Which is essentially

50:52.920 --> 50:53.920
Turning most of Linux

50:53.920 --> 50:54.920
Into a monoculture

50:54.920 --> 50:55.920
Because

50:55.920 --> 50:59.920
Even if you want to do something

50:59.920 --> 51:00.920
That is not

51:00.920 --> 51:01.920
System D

51:01.920 --> 51:02.920
You then have to

51:02.920 --> 51:03.920
Do a lot of work

51:03.920 --> 51:04.920
Such as

51:04.920 --> 51:05.920
You can

51:05.920 --> 51:06.920
You can do so much

51:06.920 --> 51:07.920
Work to the extent

51:07.920 --> 51:08.920
That you're actually

51:08.920 --> 51:09.920
Forking parts of

51:09.920 --> 51:10.920
Desktop environments

51:10.920 --> 51:11.920
Just to make things

51:11.920 --> 51:12.920
Work without System D

51:12.920 --> 51:13.920
And

51:13.920 --> 51:14.920
I think

51:14.920 --> 51:15.920
People in the

51:15.920 --> 51:16.920
Debian project

51:16.920 --> 51:17.920
Are really worried about this

51:17.920 --> 51:18.920
And I think

51:18.920 --> 51:19.920
They should be

51:19.920 --> 51:20.920
Because

51:20.920 --> 51:21.920
Essentially System D

51:21.920 --> 51:22.920
Is not a community project

51:22.920 --> 51:23.920
It's a Red Hat project

51:23.920 --> 51:24.920
And Red Hat can be

51:24.920 --> 51:25.920
Exercising political power

51:25.920 --> 51:26.920
Using technical

51:26.920 --> 51:27.920
Manipulation

51:27.920 --> 51:28.920
Alright

51:28.920 --> 51:29.920
Alright

51:29.920 --> 51:30.920
Okay

51:30.920 --> 51:31.920
Let's get on the topic

51:31.920 --> 51:32.920
Because I don't agree

51:32.920 --> 51:33.920
With half of what you said

51:33.920 --> 51:34.920
But I really don't want

51:34.920 --> 51:35.920
To debate it anymore

51:35.920 --> 51:36.920
And it's not a Red Hat project

51:36.920 --> 51:37.920
Yes, Red Hat's involved in it

51:37.920 --> 51:38.920
I think that's one of the reasons

51:38.920 --> 51:39.920
It's been as successful as it has

51:39.920 --> 51:40.920
And yes, I would be also concerned

51:40.920 --> 51:41.920
If I was a big competitor

51:41.920 --> 51:42.920
Of Red Hat

51:42.920 --> 51:43.920
About that

51:43.920 --> 51:44.920
But to be truthfully

51:44.920 --> 51:45.920
To call it a Red Hat project

51:45.920 --> 51:46.920
That's sort of disrespectful

51:46.920 --> 51:47.920
To all of the engineers

51:47.920 --> 51:48.920
At Intel

51:48.920 --> 51:49.920
And all of the engineers

51:49.920 --> 51:50.920
At SUSE

51:50.920 --> 51:51.920
That are developing on it

51:51.920 --> 51:52.920
Every single day

51:52.920 --> 51:53.920
The developers at Arch

51:53.920 --> 51:54.920
That are writing code on it

51:54.920 --> 51:55.920
Every single day

51:55.920 --> 51:56.920
I mean

51:56.920 --> 51:57.920
That's disrespectful to all

51:57.920 --> 51:58.920
Of the people outside of Red Hat

51:58.920 --> 51:59.920
That are contributing to it

51:59.920 --> 52:00.920
We don't need to be this extreme

52:00.920 --> 52:01.920
When we talk about it

52:01.920 --> 52:02.920
Yes, it has its downsides

52:02.920 --> 52:03.920
The monoculture can be bad

52:03.920 --> 52:04.920
But we don't

52:04.920 --> 52:05.920
You don't have to exaggerate it either

52:05.920 --> 52:06.920
It is what it is

52:06.920 --> 52:07.920
But I don't want to discuss it

52:07.920 --> 52:08.920
You're right

52:08.920 --> 52:09.920
Okay

52:09.920 --> 52:10.920
We're done

52:10.920 --> 52:11.920
The system, do you think

52:11.920 --> 52:12.920
To be honest with you

52:12.920 --> 52:13.920
Until something more changes

52:13.920 --> 52:14.920
I feel like

52:14.920 --> 52:15.920
It's

52:15.920 --> 52:16.920
I feel like

52:16.920 --> 52:17.920
As a community

52:17.920 --> 52:18.920
We've talked it to death

52:18.920 --> 52:19.920
I mean

52:19.920 --> 52:20.920
I talk about stuff for a living

52:20.920 --> 52:21.920
And I'm done talking about it

52:21.920 --> 52:22.920
It's just

52:22.920 --> 52:23.920
You know

52:23.920 --> 52:24.920
I really think

52:24.920 --> 52:25.920
It's an interesting

52:25.920 --> 52:26.920
I really think

52:26.920 --> 52:27.920
It's an interesting topic

52:27.920 --> 52:28.920
I do

52:28.920 --> 52:29.920
I do too

52:29.920 --> 52:30.920
But I also have to respect

52:30.920 --> 52:31.920
A lot of the audience

52:31.920 --> 52:32.920
Doesn't care anymore

52:32.920 --> 52:33.920
So

52:33.920 --> 52:34.920
And I really don't understand

52:34.920 --> 52:35.920
Why we make this more complicated

52:35.920 --> 52:36.920
Than it needs to be

52:36.920 --> 52:37.920
It's like look

52:37.920 --> 52:38.920
Okay

52:38.920 --> 52:39.920
We get a kiddie swimming pool

52:39.920 --> 52:40.920
Loaded up with mud

52:40.920 --> 52:41.920
Maybe a little salsa

52:41.920 --> 52:42.920
And mud wrestle

52:42.920 --> 52:43.920
Whoever wins

52:43.920 --> 52:44.920
Wins

52:44.920 --> 52:45.920
You know what

52:45.920 --> 52:46.920
If we could solve it that way

52:46.920 --> 52:47.920
I'd be all for it

52:47.920 --> 52:48.920
I mean

52:48.920 --> 52:49.920
Honestly

52:49.920 --> 52:50.920
I could continue to debate it

52:50.920 --> 52:51.920
I agree

52:51.920 --> 52:52.920
And I think it's a fascinating thing

52:52.920 --> 52:53.920
But at a point

52:53.920 --> 52:54.920
The conversation starts getting into

52:54.920 --> 52:55.920
A lot of

52:55.920 --> 52:56.920
A lot of different areas

52:56.920 --> 52:57.920
That I just

52:57.920 --> 52:58.920
I just don't think

52:58.920 --> 52:59.920
We've tried it too many times

52:59.920 --> 53:00.920
Absolutely

53:00.920 --> 53:01.920
Maybe

53:01.920 --> 53:02.920
You know what

53:02.920 --> 53:03.920
I'm not saying

53:03.920 --> 53:04.920
I'm not shutting the conversation

53:04.920 --> 53:05.920
Down forever

53:05.920 --> 53:06.920
I just want to give it some time

53:06.920 --> 53:07.920
To breathe

53:07.920 --> 53:08.920
And develop more

53:08.920 --> 53:09.920
Yeah

53:09.920 --> 53:10.920
Before we obsess on it

53:10.920 --> 53:11.920
Put it on the windowsill

53:11.920 --> 53:12.920
For a bit

53:12.920 --> 53:13.920
Sure

53:13.920 --> 53:14.920
Yeah

53:14.920 --> 53:15.920
All right

53:15.920 --> 53:16.920
So you know what

53:16.920 --> 53:17.920
Let's take a break

53:17.920 --> 53:18.920
To sort of change gears

53:18.920 --> 53:19.920
And then

53:19.920 --> 53:20.920
We're going to work on

53:20.920 --> 53:21.920
This is

53:21.920 --> 53:22.920
There's sort of a theme

53:22.920 --> 53:23.920
To today's episode

53:23.920 --> 53:24.920
And we're going to round it off

53:24.920 --> 53:25.920
With a final topic

53:25.920 --> 53:26.920
And I think we'll have

53:26.920 --> 53:27.920
A lot more to come

53:27.920 --> 53:28.920
And you'll save $25

53:28.920 --> 53:29.920
Off your first Ting device

53:29.920 --> 53:30.920
If you already have

53:30.920 --> 53:31.920
A Ting compatible device

53:31.920 --> 53:32.920
You'll get $25

53:32.920 --> 53:33.920
Of credits

53:33.920 --> 53:34.920
And because Ting is only

53:34.920 --> 53:35.920
Paid for what you use

53:35.920 --> 53:36.920
It's a flat $6 for the line

53:36.920 --> 53:37.920
And it's just your minutes

53:37.920 --> 53:38.920
Your messages

53:38.920 --> 53:39.920
Your megabytes

53:39.920 --> 53:40.920
That $25

53:40.920 --> 53:41.920
Might carry you through

53:41.920 --> 53:42.920
More than your first month

53:42.920 --> 53:43.920
It did for me

53:43.920 --> 53:44.920
And I still haven't forgotten that

53:44.920 --> 53:45.920
That was my

53:45.920 --> 53:46.920
That was I think

53:46.920 --> 53:47.920
A pretty awesome

53:47.920 --> 53:48.920
First impression of Ting

53:48.920 --> 53:49.920
Now I'm coming in

53:49.920 --> 53:50.920
On my second year almost

53:50.920 --> 53:51.920
I think it will be

53:51.920 --> 53:52.920
Towards the end of December

53:52.920 --> 53:53.920
And it's amazing

53:53.920 --> 53:54.920
I've got the Nexus 5

53:54.920 --> 53:55.920
The iPhone 5

53:55.920 --> 53:56.920
$6 each

53:56.920 --> 53:57.920
Only paying for what I use

53:57.920 --> 53:58.920
And Ting has no

53:58.920 --> 53:59.920
Whole customer service

53:59.920 --> 54:00.920
Which is crazy great

54:00.920 --> 54:01.920
1855

54:01.920 --> 54:02.920
Ting FTW

54:02.920 --> 54:03.920
Any time between 8 AM

54:03.920 --> 54:04.920
Or 8 PM

54:04.920 --> 54:05.920
And a human being

54:05.920 --> 54:06.920
Answers the phone

54:06.920 --> 54:07.920
And they solve your problems

54:07.920 --> 54:08.920
They have a great dashboard

54:08.920 --> 54:09.920
I mean it really is great

54:09.920 --> 54:10.920
It's better than any

54:10.920 --> 54:11.920
Mobile carrier's dashboard

54:11.920 --> 54:12.920
And I know

54:12.920 --> 54:13.920
Because I've tried them all

54:13.920 --> 54:14.920
You can activate

54:14.920 --> 54:15.920
Deactivate lines

54:15.920 --> 54:16.920
Transfer devices

54:16.920 --> 54:17.920
Set nicknames

54:17.920 --> 54:18.920
Alerts

54:18.920 --> 54:19.920
Thresholds

54:19.920 --> 54:20.920
All kinds of really

54:20.920 --> 54:21.920
Crazy stuff

54:21.920 --> 54:22.920
You wouldn't believe

54:22.920 --> 54:23.920
You could even pay for your

54:23.920 --> 54:24.920
Ting account

54:24.920 --> 54:25.920
You could even pay for your

54:25.920 --> 54:26.920
Nexus 6

54:26.920 --> 54:27.920
You know that big old

54:27.920 --> 54:28.920
Nexus 6

54:28.920 --> 54:29.920
Well it's coming real soon

54:29.920 --> 54:30.920
To Ting

54:30.920 --> 54:31.920
So now is the time

54:31.920 --> 54:32.920
To grab your Sim

54:32.920 --> 54:33.920
If you're looking for

54:33.920 --> 54:34.920
The Nexus 6

54:34.920 --> 54:35.920
On Ting

54:35.920 --> 54:36.920
Which would be an awesome

54:36.920 --> 54:37.920
Combo

54:37.920 --> 54:38.920
Nexus 6

54:38.920 --> 54:39.920
Android L

54:39.920 --> 54:40.920
Ting

54:40.920 --> 54:41.920
Only pay for what you use

54:41.920 --> 54:42.920
No contract

54:42.920 --> 54:43.920
No early termination fee

54:43.920 --> 54:44.920
Kind of awesome

54:44.920 --> 54:45.920
So go order a Ting

54:45.920 --> 54:46.920
Nexus to Sim card

54:46.920 --> 54:47.920
Go get that

54:47.920 --> 54:48.920
Then you grab your Nexus 6

54:48.920 --> 54:49.920
Pop your Ting card in there

54:49.920 --> 54:50.920
Then you go over to their website

54:50.920 --> 54:51.920
Bob's your uncle

54:51.920 --> 54:52.920
Now you got Ting service

54:52.920 --> 54:53.920
On your Nexus 6

54:53.920 --> 54:54.920
Woowee

54:54.920 --> 54:55.920
Linux.ting.com

54:55.920 --> 54:56.920
Linux.ting.com

54:56.920 --> 54:57.920
That lets them know

54:57.920 --> 54:58.920
You appreciate them supporting

54:58.920 --> 54:59.920
The Linux Unplugged Show

54:59.920 --> 55:00.920
Linux.ting.com

55:00.920 --> 55:01.920
And it gets you that

55:01.920 --> 55:02.920
$25 credit

55:02.920 --> 55:03.920
And a big thank you to Ting

55:03.920 --> 55:04.920
For sponsoring

55:04.920 --> 55:05.920
The Linux Unplugged Show

55:07.920 --> 55:08.920
Okay, alright, okay, okay

55:08.920 --> 55:09.920
Alright, shake it off guys

55:09.920 --> 55:10.920
Everybody's good

55:10.920 --> 55:11.920
We're good, we're good

55:11.920 --> 55:12.920
Cause I don't want this

55:12.920 --> 55:13.920
To be a negative thing

55:13.920 --> 55:14.920
Because I've seen this

55:14.920 --> 55:15.920
Kicked around a couple of times

55:15.920 --> 55:16.920
And I saw it land

55:16.920 --> 55:17.920
On Reddit today

55:17.920 --> 55:18.920
And he said

55:18.920 --> 55:19.920
Oh I'm sorry

55:19.920 --> 55:20.920
It was yesterday

55:20.920 --> 55:21.920
He says what are the

55:21.920 --> 55:22.920
Drawbacks of Linux

55:22.920 --> 55:23.920
Considering moving

55:23.920 --> 55:24.920
From Windows

55:24.920 --> 55:25.920
To Linux

55:25.920 --> 55:26.920
I use my computer

55:26.920 --> 55:27.920
A lot at work

55:27.920 --> 55:28.920
And unfortunately

55:28.920 --> 55:29.920
The business world

55:29.920 --> 55:30.920
Is riddled with Windows

55:30.920 --> 55:31.920
I'm currently on a Mac

55:31.920 --> 55:32.920
Oh, I misread that

55:32.920 --> 55:33.920
I'm currently on a Mac

55:33.920 --> 55:34.920
And the good thing with that

55:34.920 --> 55:35.920
Has been

55:35.920 --> 55:36.920
There's Office

55:36.920 --> 55:37.920
For OS X

55:37.920 --> 55:38.920
I don't like Office

55:38.920 --> 55:39.920
But it makes life easier

55:39.920 --> 55:40.920
But more importantly

55:40.920 --> 55:41.920
Besides the small things

55:41.920 --> 55:42.920
Like MS Office

55:42.920 --> 55:43.920
What other drawbacks

55:43.920 --> 55:44.920
Should I take into

55:44.920 --> 55:45.920
Consideration about Linux

55:45.920 --> 55:46.920
I'm fully aware of how awesome

55:46.920 --> 55:47.920
Some software is

55:47.920 --> 55:48.920
But he wants to know

55:48.920 --> 55:49.920
From the perspective

55:49.920 --> 55:50.920
Of long time users

55:50.920 --> 55:51.920
So

55:51.920 --> 55:52.920
I read some of these comments

55:52.920 --> 55:55.920
And I thought to myself

55:55.920 --> 55:57.920
I think coming out of it

55:57.920 --> 55:58.920
That the most complicated

55:58.920 --> 55:59.920
Thing about Linux

55:59.920 --> 56:00.920
Is also the strongest

56:00.920 --> 56:01.920
And best thing about Linux

56:01.920 --> 56:02.920
And that is

56:02.920 --> 56:03.920
There's a lot of diversity

56:03.920 --> 56:04.920
There's a lot of things

56:04.920 --> 56:05.920
Going on

56:05.920 --> 56:06.920
There's a lot of different

56:06.920 --> 56:07.920
Projects

56:07.920 --> 56:08.920
There's a lot of different

56:08.920 --> 56:09.920
Efforts underway

56:09.920 --> 56:10.920
All at once

56:10.920 --> 56:11.920
And when you step back

56:11.920 --> 56:12.920
From the big picture

56:12.920 --> 56:13.920
That's a great thing

56:13.920 --> 56:14.920
But when you get down

56:14.920 --> 56:15.920
Into the weeds

56:15.920 --> 56:16.920
It looks like insanity

56:16.920 --> 56:17.920
Or maybe that's vice versa

56:17.920 --> 56:18.920
I'm not so sure

56:18.920 --> 56:19.920
Okay

56:19.920 --> 56:20.920
So I know everybody

56:20.920 --> 56:21.920
Probably has a few ideas

56:21.920 --> 56:22.920
I saw that

56:22.920 --> 56:23.920
Wizard Jed

56:23.920 --> 56:24.920
Tossed his hat in the ring

56:24.920 --> 56:25.920
So Wizard Jed

56:25.920 --> 56:26.920
What's your take on this?

56:26.920 --> 56:28.920
So there's a lot of

56:28.920 --> 56:29.920
Really really high level

56:29.920 --> 56:30.920
Software out there right now

56:30.920 --> 56:32.920
That is extremely complicated

56:32.920 --> 56:34.920
And things like

56:34.920 --> 56:37.920
High end parts of Libre Office

56:37.920 --> 56:39.920
And high end parts of

56:39.920 --> 56:40.920
Specifically Microsoft

56:40.920 --> 56:42.920
Style products like SSMS

56:42.920 --> 56:45.920
It's the pieces of software

56:45.920 --> 56:46.920
That aren't necessarily

56:46.920 --> 56:47.920
Really nice

56:47.920 --> 56:48.920
And it's not that

56:48.920 --> 56:49.920
They don't have an alternative

56:49.920 --> 56:51.920
So this is your drawback

56:51.920 --> 56:53.920
Well these are just

56:53.920 --> 56:54.920
General things

56:54.920 --> 56:55.920
They'll just be

56:55.920 --> 56:56.920
Something that will

56:56.920 --> 56:57.920
Be there

56:57.920 --> 56:58.920
And people will say

56:58.920 --> 56:59.920
You have to use this

56:59.920 --> 57:01.920
And you're using this

57:01.920 --> 57:03.920
Because there's no training

57:03.920 --> 57:04.920
For the other things

57:04.920 --> 57:05.920
So we're not even

57:05.920 --> 57:06.920
Going to look at it

57:06.920 --> 57:07.920
It's not even an option

57:07.920 --> 57:08.920
Hmm

57:08.920 --> 57:09.920
Alright

57:09.920 --> 57:10.920
So my drawback was

57:10.920 --> 57:11.920
Sort of like

57:11.920 --> 57:12.920
It can be a mess

57:12.920 --> 57:13.920
A little bit

57:13.920 --> 57:14.920
But you can avoid that

57:14.920 --> 57:15.920
And when you say

57:15.920 --> 57:16.920
Software support

57:16.920 --> 57:17.920
You're coming out from

57:17.920 --> 57:18.920
The things like

57:18.920 --> 57:19.920
Large management suites

57:19.920 --> 57:20.920
Like from Microsoft

57:20.920 --> 57:21.920
Maybe the AutoCAD

57:21.920 --> 57:22.920
That's a popular one

57:22.920 --> 57:23.920
But I feel like

57:23.920 --> 57:24.920
Those are like

57:24.920 --> 57:25.920
Well known drawbacks

57:25.920 --> 57:26.920
That if you are

57:26.920 --> 57:27.920
Working maybe

57:27.920 --> 57:28.920
On a Mac now

57:28.920 --> 57:29.920
Maybe it's not a problem

57:29.920 --> 57:30.920
Right

57:30.920 --> 57:31.920
Because you're probably

57:31.920 --> 57:32.920
Not plugged into an SMS

57:32.920 --> 57:33.920
Management infrastructure

57:33.920 --> 57:34.920
Or using AutoCAD

57:34.920 --> 57:35.920
That's on Windows

57:35.920 --> 57:36.920
Right

57:36.920 --> 57:37.920
So that might not be

57:37.920 --> 57:38.920
As much of an issue

57:38.920 --> 57:39.920
I'm trying to think of

57:39.920 --> 57:40.920
Drawbacks that

57:40.920 --> 57:41.920
Would smack you more

57:41.920 --> 57:42.920
In the face

57:42.920 --> 57:43.920
But I could see

57:43.920 --> 57:44.920
Definitely software

57:44.920 --> 57:45.920
Availability being one

57:45.920 --> 57:46.920
That if you didn't

57:46.920 --> 57:47.920
Research first

57:47.920 --> 57:48.920
Then another thing

57:48.920 --> 57:49.920
Would be

57:49.920 --> 57:50.920
One is just

57:50.920 --> 57:51.920
The package

57:51.920 --> 57:52.920
You know

57:52.920 --> 57:53.920
Just discovering

57:53.920 --> 57:54.920
The different packages

57:54.920 --> 57:55.920
And applications

57:55.920 --> 57:56.920
You can get

57:56.920 --> 57:57.920
Then also discovering

57:57.920 --> 57:58.920
Which one works

57:58.920 --> 57:59.920
For your distro

57:59.920 --> 58:00.920
And then also

58:00.920 --> 58:01.920
To find out which version

58:01.920 --> 58:02.920
That you want to use

58:02.920 --> 58:03.920
Because you

58:03.920 --> 58:04.920
You know

58:04.920 --> 58:05.920
There's a lot of the time

58:05.920 --> 58:06.920
The stuff that's in

58:06.920 --> 58:07.920
The official repo

58:07.920 --> 58:08.920
Is out of date

58:08.920 --> 58:09.920
And you have no idea

58:09.920 --> 58:10.920
So people who are

58:10.920 --> 58:11.920
Coming into Linux

58:11.920 --> 58:12.920
And are expecting

58:12.920 --> 58:13.920
To be able to

58:13.920 --> 58:14.920
Like search Google

58:14.920 --> 58:15.920
Or something

58:15.920 --> 58:16.920
They're probably

58:16.920 --> 58:17.920
Not expecting

58:17.920 --> 58:18.920
That

58:18.920 --> 58:19.920
Now what do you think

58:19.920 --> 58:20.920
How important is that

58:20.920 --> 58:21.920
Like that local

58:21.920 --> 58:22.920
Tech support angle

58:22.920 --> 58:23.920
You know

58:23.920 --> 58:24.920
If you got

58:24.920 --> 58:25.920
A Windows or a Mac

58:25.920 --> 58:26.920
There's a good chance

58:26.920 --> 58:27.920
You can either go

58:27.920 --> 58:28.920
Talk to the Geek Squad

58:28.920 --> 58:29.920
Or there's somebody

58:29.920 --> 58:30.920
In your local

58:30.920 --> 58:31.920
Social group

58:31.920 --> 58:32.920
That probably knows

58:32.920 --> 58:33.920
How to troubleshoot

58:33.920 --> 58:34.920
The problem

58:34.920 --> 58:35.920
Maybe not the case

58:35.920 --> 58:36.920
If you got a

58:36.920 --> 58:37.920
Linux box, right

58:37.920 --> 58:38.920
Don't you think

58:38.920 --> 58:39.920
Go ahead

58:39.920 --> 58:40.920
I know

58:40.920 --> 58:41.920
All right

58:41.920 --> 58:42.920
Go ahead

58:42.920 --> 58:43.920
Matt

58:43.920 --> 58:44.920
You take it

58:44.920 --> 58:45.920
Okay

58:45.920 --> 58:46.920
So that's

58:46.920 --> 58:47.920
That's a big thing

58:47.920 --> 58:48.920
Because you know

58:48.920 --> 58:49.920
I used to do

58:49.920 --> 58:50.920
A lot of home repair

58:50.920 --> 58:51.920
Way, way back in the day

58:51.920 --> 58:52.920
And that's one thing

58:52.920 --> 58:53.920
That I ran into

58:53.920 --> 58:54.920
Is if I was going to

58:54.920 --> 58:55.920
Switch someone over to Linux

58:55.920 --> 58:56.920
I had better not retire

58:56.920 --> 58:57.920
Because I'm going to be

58:57.920 --> 58:58.920
The one supporting it

58:58.920 --> 58:59.920
No one else is

58:59.920 --> 59:00.920
I think that's definitely

59:00.920 --> 59:01.920
A problem

59:01.920 --> 59:02.920
Because for whatever reason

59:02.920 --> 59:03.920
Local techs just don't

59:03.920 --> 59:04.920
Seem to think

59:04.920 --> 59:05.920
That there's any money in it

59:05.920 --> 59:06.920
Or they're not able to learn

59:06.920 --> 59:07.920
Or whatever their individual

59:07.920 --> 59:08.920
Vices may be against it

59:08.920 --> 59:09.920
But that is definitely

59:09.920 --> 59:10.920
A problem

59:10.920 --> 59:11.920
Yeah

59:11.920 --> 59:12.920
And people get confused

59:12.920 --> 59:13.920
By choice

59:13.920 --> 59:14.920
But I feel like

59:14.920 --> 59:15.920
This is a problem

59:15.920 --> 59:16.920
That us geeks

59:16.920 --> 59:17.920
Obsess about

59:17.920 --> 59:18.920
Way

59:18.920 --> 59:19.920
See okay

59:19.920 --> 59:20.920
Here's my final thought on this

59:20.920 --> 59:21.920
And then mumble and I'll let

59:21.920 --> 59:22.920
Anybody else that has

59:22.920 --> 59:23.920
Any closing thoughts

59:23.920 --> 59:24.920
But here's my final thought

59:24.920 --> 59:25.920
Is this is a problem

59:25.920 --> 59:26.920
That us geeks worry about

59:26.920 --> 59:27.920
Way more than end users

59:27.920 --> 59:28.920
Worry about

59:28.920 --> 59:29.920
They don't think about it

59:29.920 --> 59:30.920
See they don't think

59:30.920 --> 59:31.920
Software first

59:31.920 --> 59:32.920
They think

59:32.920 --> 59:33.920
I got to buy a device first

59:33.920 --> 59:34.920
That's how they go

59:34.920 --> 59:35.920
And they don't

59:35.920 --> 59:36.920
You know

59:36.920 --> 59:37.920
I mean

59:37.920 --> 59:38.920
So it's

59:38.920 --> 59:39.920
There's all this choice

59:39.920 --> 59:40.920
All this complexity

59:40.920 --> 59:41.920
Or randomness

59:41.920 --> 59:42.920
Whatever you want to call it

59:42.920 --> 59:43.920
It doesn't matter to them

59:43.920 --> 59:44.920
They get somebody

59:44.920 --> 59:45.920
And they say okay

59:45.920 --> 59:46.920
I've decided I want to do

59:46.920 --> 59:47.920
This Windows thing

59:47.920 --> 59:48.920
And Mac isn't for me

59:48.920 --> 59:49.920
And they go say

59:49.920 --> 59:50.920
Grab a

59:50.920 --> 59:51.920
System 76 Ultra Pro

59:51.920 --> 59:52.920
They they will never really

59:52.920 --> 59:53.920
Have to worry

59:53.920 --> 59:54.920
That there's

59:54.920 --> 59:55.920
A dozen different desktop

59:55.920 --> 59:56.920
Environments if they want

59:56.920 --> 59:57.920
You know

59:57.920 --> 59:58.920
They don't

59:58.920 --> 59:59.920
They don't ever have to

59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.920
Consider it

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.920
So I think it's a problem

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.920
That really exists

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.920
In the minds of geeks

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.920
And not so much in a problem

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.920
Of end users

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:06.920
And then of course

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.920
Then you get into

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.920
The gray area where you have

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:09.920
Your more advanced users

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.920
That want to be able to go out

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:11.920
And grab a piece of hardware

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.920
Or something like that

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:13.920
And the end users

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.920
We're really talking about here

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.920
I don't think it's

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.920
A big of a problem

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.920
Anybody disagree?

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.920
No

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.920
That's particularly right

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.920
No

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920
Yeah

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.920
If they have

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:23.920
If they have something like

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:24.920
Access to something like that

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.920
That'd be great

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.920
If they're just trying

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.920
To find Linux

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.920
Because they've heard about it

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.920
Then it's really hard to find

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920
People to help you

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.920
Like there's lugs

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.920
But they're hard to

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.920
Yeah

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.920
Find themselves

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.920
And sometimes the lugs

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.920
Aren't very organized

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:37.920
So it's

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.920
You know

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:39.920
They might show up one day

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:40.920
And then change it the next week

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:41.920
And you know

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.920
You can't do that

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.920
But yet that survey shows

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.920
That so many of the people

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:45.920
In that survey were using

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.920
Linux on their desktop

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.920
So it happens

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:48.920
It doesn't happen very easily

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:49.920
But it gets out there

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:50.920
And it's really

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.920
I think

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.920
I don't know

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:53.920
I think

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:54.920
I think once you discover it

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:55.920
If you are technically inclined

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.920
It's pretty attractive

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.920
And I think that's more

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.920
Of our user base

01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.920
I think if we're true

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.920
To ourselves

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:01.920
Because of these barriers

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.920
We've talked about

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.920
In today's episode

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:04.920
The problem of discovering it

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.920
And the problem of

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920
You know

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.920
All these little issues

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.920
That we've just talked about

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.920
I think it's more practical

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:10.920
To expect that it's

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.920
Going to be finding

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:12.920
And discovering

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.920
And implementing it

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.920
And that's why we're all

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:15.920
Obsessed about this stuff

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.920
Because that's

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.920
That's all who we are

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.920
It's a big echo chamber

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920
And if you step outside

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.920
The echo chamber

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.920
It's not that big of a deal

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.920
That's my thoughts

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:23.920
Hey

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.920
I'll give a plug

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920

Go to JBtitles.com

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.920
We got a boat on this thing

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:28.920
See, I don't know if we're

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.920
Going to get something

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:30.920
Out of this

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:31.920
It's a mess

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:32.920
What a mess

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:33.920
JBtitles.com

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:34.920
Hey, I had a question

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:35.920
I wanted to ask everybody

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:36.920
Twitch chat room

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.920
Anybody listening

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:38.920
I'm doing some improvements

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:39.920
In my Twitter feed

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:40.920
My Twitter feed

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.920
And I'm wondering

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:42.920
If there's

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:43.920
If anybody could toss links

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:44.920
In the IRC

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.920
For interesting folks

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:46.920
In the Linux community

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.920
That you follow

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:48.920
That maybe I should follow

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920
So put links in the chat room

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.920
All right, JBtitles.com

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.920
Did we get any titles at all?

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.920
Anybody suggesting titles?

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:53.920
We got a lot

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:54.920
Yeah, there are some titles

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:55.920
There

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.920
Oh, good

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.920
Good

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.920
Oh, yeah, we did

01:03:58.920 --> 01:03:59.920
Okay, all right

It's also

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:31.920
Yeah

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.920
I think it's worth remembering

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:33.920
That it's just you guys

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.920
It's

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.920
In the end of the day

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.920
It's just you guys

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:38.920
The project's still awesome

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:39.920
Sure, sure

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.920
JBtitles.com

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.920
It's just you guys

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.920
That'd make a good title

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.920
Right there

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.920
It's just you guys

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.920
Two guys in a podcast

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.920
The real issues

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.920
I'm biting my tongue

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.920
I'm not saying a word

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:49.920
The real issues of Linux

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.920
How do you like that?

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.920
Yeah, well

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.920
The real issues of Linux

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.920
I still like Debbie and Community Divided

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.920
Because it's not inaccurate

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:58.920
Yeah

01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.920
Yeah

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:00.920
It really isn't

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:01.920
And that's not

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.920
Yeah

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:03.920
Necessarily negative

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:04.920
It's just factual

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:05.920
Yeah

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:06.920
I mean, you say Community Divided

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:07.920
And that's true

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:08.920
For all of it

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.920
Yeah, I mean

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:10.920
Really, I mean

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:11.920
What Community isn't

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:12.920
It has division

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.920
At some point

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.920
The drawbacks of Linux

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:15.920
Because I feel like

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.920
The Debian part

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:17.920
Was more of an overall

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.920
Discussion

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:19.920
Okay

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:20.920
I mean, it could be

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.920
Just about Debian

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:22.920
I mean, that's not bad

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.920
But

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:24.920
I think that's

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.920
I hate to say it

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.920
But there was so much of it

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.920
That was

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:28.920
Yeah

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.920
That it would feel disingenuous

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:30.920
To try and like

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:31.920
Spin some happy little

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:32.920
Bunny time thing in there

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.920
I don't know

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:34.920
Yeah

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:35.920
All right

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:36.920
Well, we'll let democracy decide

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:37.920
JBTitles.com

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.920
JBTitles.com

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.920
The vote is on

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:40.920
Democracy

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.920
Mm-hmm

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.920
Mm-hmm

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.920
Mm-hmm

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.920
I think it's wasted effort

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.920
Hmm

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.920
Beating the System D horse

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.920
Debbie and Community Divided

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:49.920
Is still rising

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.920
Two sides

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.920
One System D

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:53.920
That's not bad

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.920
That's not bad

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:55.920
It's a little dirty though

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.920
Okay

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:57.920
I think Debbie and

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.920
I think Debbie and Community Divided

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:01.920
Is our winner

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:02.920
Ladies and gentlemen

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.920
I think we're going to go that way

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:06.920
All right

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.920
So, hour early everybody

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:08.920

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:09.920
