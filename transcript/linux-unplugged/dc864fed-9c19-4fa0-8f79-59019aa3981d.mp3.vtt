WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.240
Now, before we start, I was wondering if I could get Wimpy to tell us about, I think

00:05.240 --> 00:09.880
Wimpy spent the morning, or actually for him, he spent the afternoon evening at a makerspace.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.880
Is that true, Wimpy?

00:11.880 --> 00:13.160
I have, yes.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.920
And tell me about this.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.720
This sounds pretty cool.

00:16.720 --> 00:22.480
So this is a new makerspace that is, we don't actually have a space yet, we're just a bunch

00:22.480 --> 00:24.680
of makers right now.

00:24.680 --> 00:30.160
So in my local area, I live in an area called Basingstoke and Dean.

00:30.160 --> 00:34.480
So this is Bad Hack, is our makerspace.

00:34.480 --> 00:35.840
That's awesome.

00:35.840 --> 00:40.240
This is like the third meeting, I've been to the last two, and we're just sort of drumming

00:40.240 --> 00:46.640
up members and figuring out who's got what skills and we're doing little presentations

00:46.640 --> 00:51.560
and show and tells and things, figuring out some projects that we're going to work on,

00:51.560 --> 00:58.320
and also looking for somewhere that could be a permanent facility that's open 24 seven,

00:58.320 --> 01:01.960
so that people can just go there and work on projects whenever it suits them.

01:01.960 --> 01:06.640
And this evening was good because we've sort of reached out to the craft makers in the

01:06.640 --> 01:07.640
community.

01:07.640 --> 01:14.840
So we had a load of people that do crochet and knitting and also textile crafts there

01:14.840 --> 01:15.840
this evening.

01:15.840 --> 01:20.200
So we've got quite a broad range of skills now to go with all the software and hardware

01:20.200 --> 01:25.040
engineers and roboticists and electronics and PCB design guys.

01:25.040 --> 01:28.200
So we've got a good spectrum of skills.

01:28.200 --> 01:32.600
So we're starting to think up some group projects we can work on, which will be fun.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.960
I feel you're making me feel like the worst.

01:34.960 --> 01:40.160
I was invited to a local makerspace where they're building an open source car, which

01:40.160 --> 01:41.240
has got to be cool.

01:41.240 --> 01:42.440
And I couldn't make it work.

01:42.440 --> 01:43.880
I couldn't get the timing right.

01:43.880 --> 01:47.440
I wasn't able to go, but now I kind of want to email them back because this looks like

01:47.440 --> 01:48.440
a lot of fun.

01:48.440 --> 01:52.040
That's a bit more ambitious than our first projects.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.160
Well, you've got to start somewhere.

01:54.160 --> 01:55.160
Yeah.

01:55.160 --> 01:59.480
We're going to have a go at making a 3D scanner because one of the guys in the makerspace

01:59.480 --> 02:02.120
runs a 3D printing business.

02:02.120 --> 02:08.680
So we thought we'd have a go at making a 3D scanner using a make our own rotating table

02:08.680 --> 02:12.880
with Microsoft connectors, the scanning eye.

02:12.880 --> 02:17.840
How much of the open source ethos is alive and well in a space like this?

02:17.840 --> 02:23.040
Is there a tendency towards open source and Linux, or is it more about building the thing

02:23.040 --> 02:25.560
and less about what software you're using?

02:25.560 --> 02:28.040
Yeah, I'd say the latter.

02:28.040 --> 02:32.680
So people are aware of what open source is.

02:32.680 --> 02:36.120
What I quite like is there's quite a lot of the older generation there, sort of people

02:36.120 --> 02:39.360
that have worked in electronics all their careers and have recently retired.

02:39.360 --> 02:45.240
So they still refer to everything as Unix, but the fact that they know Unix is encouraging.

02:45.240 --> 02:48.440
So people know about Linux and open source.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.120
Some of them dabble with it and use it.

02:50.120 --> 02:54.200
Obviously Raspberry Pi is prevalent, so they're all kind of aware.

02:54.200 --> 02:58.520
But yes, they're very practical in the way they use things.

02:58.520 --> 02:59.620
So it's just a tool.

02:59.620 --> 03:04.760
So if Windows does the job better, so the prototype 3D scanner is using Windows 10 at

03:04.760 --> 03:09.440
the moment, I intend to change that, but it runs Windows 10 at the moment.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.440
That's because it was easy for them to do it.

03:12.440 --> 03:20.760
So there is some awareness, but it isn't the core running through the group at all, I would

03:20.760 --> 03:21.760
say.

03:21.760 --> 03:26.920
I'm the only person that is really invested in open source.

03:26.920 --> 03:33.200
Really what you're saying is that your work is definitely cut out for you.

03:33.200 --> 03:50.360
This is Linux Unplugged episode 175 for December 13th, 2016.

03:50.360 --> 03:54.980
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that just can't avoid feeling that

03:54.980 --> 03:56.120
holiday spirit.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.120
My name is Chris.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.120
My name is Wes.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.480
Wes, you got a mug in your hands too.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.360
It looks like you're sipping on like some cocoa.

04:02.360 --> 04:03.360
Some can pretend.

04:03.360 --> 04:06.000
You could bring up the eight-hour YouTube fireplace on the screen there.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.320
It'd really feel festive in here.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.880
I'm sure the MoMa Room would just love that.

04:09.880 --> 04:10.880
That's not what we're here to talk about today.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.200
We're not here to talk about that, although maybe in the post-show.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200
You never know.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.200
It can go crazy.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.200
Stick around.

04:17.200 --> 04:20.680
But coming up on this week's episode, there is huge, huge news from the Nextcloud project.

04:20.680 --> 04:22.180
We'll highlight some of that.

04:22.180 --> 04:25.600
And then the Plasma desktop, it's going to be getting all up in that Nextcloud.

04:25.600 --> 04:28.160
You're not going to believe the kind of stuff they're thinking about integrating in the

04:28.160 --> 04:29.320
Plasma desktop.

04:29.320 --> 04:32.760
McAfee's making your Linux box way more vulnerable.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.360
Linus himself is feeling the holiday spirit and we'll tell you about the present he's

04:35.360 --> 04:36.840
dropping before Christmas.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.720
My buddies at Crossover have big news.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.920
There's a big security thing to talk about.

04:40.920 --> 04:47.720
And then I want to discuss the completely ridiculous, irresponsible, and maybe even

04:47.720 --> 04:51.640
dangerous collaboration happening between distros.

04:51.640 --> 04:56.000
If this kind of stuff happens, we're going to start getting results and stop wasting

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
time.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
And I can't stand for it.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.520
What are we going to come on here and rant about?

04:59.520 --> 05:02.600
So we're going to take it to Ikey and Wimpy later on in the show and ask them why they're

05:02.600 --> 05:06.200
doing so much damn good work and what the hell is going on with all this collaboration.

05:06.200 --> 05:12.640
And then after that, Google announced their plans today to kill Linux on Internet of Things.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.360
They're looking at Ubuntu snappy.

05:14.360 --> 05:20.160
They're looking at all of the efforts by different projects out there to create a free open platform

05:20.160 --> 05:21.160
for Internet of Things.

05:21.160 --> 05:29.120
And Google says, no, no, let us introduce, let us suggest, let us perhaps recommend that

05:29.120 --> 05:32.240
instead you deploy Android of Things.

05:32.240 --> 05:36.840
Android of Things is Google's new Internet of Things platform and the name is horrible

05:36.840 --> 05:41.720
and we'll tell you about their plans to try to crush the competition on Internet of Things,

05:41.720 --> 05:44.760
which I think they could have something there.

05:44.760 --> 05:45.760
They could.

05:45.760 --> 05:49.160
I think they looked over at what Canonical is doing right now with IoT devices and they

05:49.160 --> 05:50.880
went, shit, we better get rid of this.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.880
What was that called?

05:51.880 --> 05:58.480
It sounded like a kitchen, like a brassel or I can't remember what it was called, but

05:58.480 --> 06:03.720
it was essentially an Internet of Things platform that also used Weave, their mesh networking,

06:03.720 --> 06:04.720
and it didn't go anywhere.

06:04.720 --> 06:05.720
Brillo, thank you.

06:05.720 --> 06:06.720
Brillo, yes.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.560
Look at Micah68 in the chat room, nailing it.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.720
Yeah, so they had Brillo and Brillo hasn't worked out.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.480
Now we're going to discuss the pivot to Android or Android of Things or whatever it's called.

06:15.480 --> 06:19.600
But let's start with some actual really awesome Linux news and project updates, huge news

06:19.600 --> 06:24.360
from Nextcloud and all of that, and it just would be inappropriate to go any further without

06:24.360 --> 06:27.080
saying time-appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.080
Hello.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.080
Greetings, programs.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.080
Hello.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.080
Hi.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.080
Hello, everyone.

06:32.080 --> 06:38.040
So very, very excited and I'm hoping Joss will come on the Linux Action Show this Sunday

06:38.040 --> 06:42.300
to give us the real inside scoop, but I'm very excited to say that Nextcloud 11 is out

06:42.300 --> 06:45.040
and it looks like a really kick butt release.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.520
First of all, off the top of my head, the thing that I'm most excited about is two-factor

06:48.520 --> 06:50.480
authentication support.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.000
That's really big for me because the whole reason I want to use Nextcloud is because

06:53.000 --> 06:57.400
I want something that I don't trust putting in Google or other cloud services, which means

06:57.400 --> 06:58.800
it's something I really care about.

06:58.800 --> 06:59.800
Security is important.

06:59.800 --> 07:00.800
Yeah.

07:00.800 --> 07:04.500
So they also have support for new browsers, Kerberos authentication, two-factor authentication

07:04.500 --> 07:07.160
and time-based one-time passwords.

07:07.160 --> 07:12.720
They have also expanded the brute force protection on all API access points, which is brilliant,

07:12.720 --> 07:16.360
and they've made Federation more secure by better use of SSL and TLS.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.360
Excellent.

07:17.360 --> 07:22.440
And they're making sure their app store automatically checks apps and enforces their signatures.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.720
So you're getting legitimate apps.

07:23.720 --> 07:27.800
These do sound like quite a number, you know, a nice layer of security polish on the top,

07:27.800 --> 07:30.880
especially when this is the kind of service that you very well might want to expose publicly

07:30.880 --> 07:33.120
so that you can access from anywhere.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.480
Also look at this stat.

07:35.480 --> 07:41.320
This release, Nextcloud 11, decreases database load by up to 80% and improves response time

07:41.320 --> 07:45.840
by 60% for common server app operations.

07:45.840 --> 07:46.840
They've also …

07:46.840 --> 07:47.840
That's true.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.520
They have also combined multi-bucket object store support.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.600
Now, don't worry what that means.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.780
Wait till the next story.

07:53.780 --> 07:57.560
Improved handling of previews in Collabra Online, so they've sped up the online document

07:57.560 --> 07:58.560
stuff.

07:58.560 --> 08:02.160
This is really interesting, including a lot of nice improvements to backend searching.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.360
So yeah, I'm hoping to dig in …

08:03.360 --> 08:04.640
Yeah, full-text search now.

08:04.640 --> 08:05.640
That's great.

08:05.640 --> 08:06.640
Yeah.

08:06.640 --> 08:07.640
I'm hoping to dig in with Joss and try it out myself.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.080
Wimpy, is this the version … Yeah, it was Wimpy before the show.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.240
You said you tried out Nextcloud just recently, right?

08:13.240 --> 08:14.760
I've just installed it this afternoon.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.720
Was it 11, by chance?

08:17.720 --> 08:22.880
Well, when I installed it … So I've installed it in a slightly unusual fashion, which is

08:22.880 --> 08:26.840
why I've written up a blog post about it, which I've sent you a link to.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.840
I see that.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.840
I'll put it up.

08:28.840 --> 08:33.080
So I recently ordered the Nextcloud box, and that arrived.

08:33.080 --> 08:39.360
And I only had Raspberry Pi 3's, a spare, whereas the image that comes with the kit

08:39.360 --> 08:42.240
only supports the Raspberry Pi 2.

08:42.240 --> 08:50.680
So I have installed Ubuntu Core on a Raspberry Pi 3 in the Nextcloud box, and documented

08:50.680 --> 08:57.600
how to install the Nextcloud snap on that, and access the one terabyte hard disk using

08:57.600 --> 08:58.600
Ubuntu Core.

08:58.600 --> 09:04.400
And I can confirm that it works, because I followed his guide about an hour ago, and

09:04.400 --> 09:05.600
it works perfectly.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.920
What is the process of installing Nextcloud from a snap?

09:07.920 --> 09:10.080
What does that involve?

09:10.080 --> 09:12.080
Snap install Nextcloud.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.080
Oh, that's nice.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.560
Interesting.

09:15.560 --> 09:22.640
And I've just been talking to the maintainer of the Nextcloud snap, and Nextcloud 11 is

09:22.640 --> 09:28.120
in the candidate channel in the snap store, and will move to stable very soon now.

09:28.120 --> 09:33.880
And I've just refreshed my install, and I'm now running Nextcloud 11.

09:33.880 --> 09:34.880
Interesting.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.120
And what are your thoughts so far?

09:37.120 --> 09:39.880
I don't know enough about Nextcloud to comment on that.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.160
Well, just a general setup and use.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.640
What are your thoughts?

09:43.640 --> 09:46.080
Well, yeah, it's great.

09:46.080 --> 09:51.160
Logged into the website, and the web UI thing, and turned on the bits and pieces I needed

09:51.160 --> 09:56.480
to access the one terabyte drive, and turned on some extra apps like contacts and calendars.

09:56.480 --> 10:01.080
And I've imported my contacts and my calendars, and I've got those synced to a tablet.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.080
Nice.

10:02.080 --> 10:07.360
And all of that was really easy, and I've turned on my wife's phone when you take a

10:07.360 --> 10:12.680
photo or a video, automatically upload it, and that works as well.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.160
So so far, so good.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.160
I'm very pleased.

10:15.160 --> 10:21.120
But this is like, I literally started this last night and finished it at lunchtime today.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.360
So it's all very new to me, but I'm very pleased so far.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.360
It's looking good.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.680
It's certainly the best experience I've had.

10:27.680 --> 10:33.440
Last time I tried own cloud was like own cloud eight, and it still wasn't working right for

10:33.440 --> 10:34.440
me at that point.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.960
But this looks much, much closer to what I need.

10:36.960 --> 10:43.280
I'll follow with some interest your thoughts and just sort of overall feedback on how the

10:43.280 --> 10:46.840
syncing works, too, as you get a chance to play with that.

10:46.840 --> 10:52.020
And those features that you mentioned from Nextcloud 11, in terms of reducing the database

10:52.020 --> 10:55.960
overhead and everything, that will be great for running it on something small like the

10:55.960 --> 10:56.960
Pi 3.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.120
That could make a significant difference.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.320
So yes, that'll be terrific.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.820
Poby, what's your experience been?

11:02.820 --> 11:06.280
You know, just a little bit of time you've had with it so far, the UI, overall feel of

11:06.280 --> 11:08.080
it and all that.

11:08.080 --> 11:12.680
So the only negative thing I have is the fact it's a bit slow on the Raspberry Pi, but I'm

11:12.680 --> 11:16.400
hoping that some of these performance improvements you've said are in own cloud 11 will help.

11:16.400 --> 11:21.960
But I'm not expecting magic, you know, magic instant 10 times performance improvement.

11:21.960 --> 11:25.400
But I'm planning initially just to use it for the photo sync.

11:25.400 --> 11:30.580
I want to be able to have the photos from my phone and my kids to be able to take photos

11:30.580 --> 11:32.920
and it just automatically sync to the Nextcloud box.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.640
So I followed Martin's guide.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.760
I only used the Pi 2 because it was the only thing I had kicking around, like, you know,

11:38.760 --> 11:39.760
first world problems.

11:39.760 --> 11:45.360
I've only got Pi 2 and I'll install the Nextcloud client on each of their machines and have them

11:45.360 --> 11:49.680
sync in all their stuff and do that over Christmas, should be good fun, but yeah, I found it works

11:49.680 --> 11:50.680
really well.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.360
And I love the fact that I can just go snap install Nextcloud.

11:53.360 --> 11:58.560
There's a little bit of faff to do SSL, but it's only like a couple of lines.

11:58.560 --> 11:59.560
There's not a lot to it.

11:59.560 --> 12:04.080
And there was only a couple of lines to paste in to do to mount the one terabyte hard drive.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.040
So it wasn't really an awful lot of work.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.920
And thanks a lot, Martin, for doing that work.

12:09.920 --> 12:14.000
Because I basically just copy and pasted stuff into a terminal and it worked.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
That's great.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Yeah, you shouldn't do that.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.360
Even the author says that.

12:18.360 --> 12:19.960
Make sure you try his next article.

12:19.960 --> 12:20.960
No malicious intent.

12:20.960 --> 12:21.960
I'm trustworthy, apparently.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.300
Well, none of them had sudo in front of them.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.300
So I feel okay.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.300
There you go.

12:26.300 --> 12:32.240
Yeah, I think the two things that I also think about, like the planner of the Federation,

12:32.240 --> 12:37.720
so I can have a local Nextcloud instance and maybe like a droplet ones where I would hit

12:37.720 --> 12:38.720
from my phone.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.240
It's a little faster.

12:40.240 --> 12:41.240
All that kind of stuff.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.240
There's a lot of possibilities there.

12:42.240 --> 12:45.400
This is NextStory is what could push me over the edge, big time.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.140
This is so awesome.

12:47.140 --> 12:49.480
It fits with things you've been flirting with lately.

12:49.480 --> 12:53.520
So the Plasma folks have been discussing further integration with Nextcloud.

12:53.520 --> 12:57.840
And disclaimer, I think they're more discussing having a common API that would work with own

12:57.840 --> 12:59.380
cloud and Nextcloud.

12:59.380 --> 13:00.880
And they're talking to both projects about that.

13:00.880 --> 13:05.660
But the people they met with was Frank and others from Nextcloud.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.760
So that's obviously sort of how this is framed.

13:07.760 --> 13:12.280
It's written by Joss from Nextcloud.

13:12.280 --> 13:18.080
This is a feature that has been discussed is the synchronization of settings, like passwords

13:18.080 --> 13:21.480
and file metadata over to the Nextcloud server.

13:21.480 --> 13:27.800
From an implementation point of view, the latest Nextcloud features a key value store,

13:27.800 --> 13:30.600
which could be used to store client settings.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.480
This is the same way that iCloud works.

13:32.480 --> 13:37.260
When you're an iCloud developer, you can store application settings in iCloud using an iCloud

13:37.260 --> 13:39.120
key value store system.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.680
So this would be a key value store system that you could use to store the client settings

13:42.680 --> 13:44.120
of the Plasma desktop.

13:44.120 --> 13:48.520
Another area they say is they could also do the syncing of tags, ratings, and comments

13:48.520 --> 13:53.320
from applications in the file manager, which kind of blows my mind.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.320
And then, of course, being able to just offer general file sync integrated into the file

13:56.320 --> 13:57.320
manager.

13:57.320 --> 14:00.960
So they say the most important part would be to write the online accounts module, which

14:00.960 --> 14:05.840
Noam actually has this part done, where you could set up Nextcloud to begin with.

14:05.840 --> 14:11.680
And then they want to evaluate how setting up Nextcloud could then be potentially automatically

14:11.680 --> 14:14.020
set up with the KDE PIM software.

14:14.020 --> 14:20.200
So your Nextcloud calendar works in your local Plasma desktop calendar.

14:20.200 --> 14:25.640
And also you could potentially, if you wanted to and they implemented it, use the Plasma

14:25.640 --> 14:30.880
desktop search to not only search your Plasma desktop, but also the Nextcloud server for

14:30.880 --> 14:31.880
files.

14:31.880 --> 14:32.880
Wow.

14:32.880 --> 14:33.880
Oh, that is cool.

14:33.880 --> 14:34.880
Yeah.

14:34.880 --> 14:35.880
That is pretty slick.

14:35.880 --> 14:40.760
So, you know, not only is this a way to synchronize your settings in a way that feels like it

14:40.760 --> 14:44.880
should be pretty good since it'd be supported and built into the desktop environment, but

14:44.880 --> 14:50.400
you could keep it completely private, this is what it should be.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.520
This kind of collaboration and this kind of communication and this kind of, hey, you're

14:53.520 --> 14:57.000
doing this really well and we're doing this pretty good.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.200
Why don't we, why don't you just do what you do best and we'll do what we do best because

15:01.200 --> 15:06.120
these guys could have gone with some sort of crazy Plasma online that's $9.99 a year

15:06.120 --> 15:07.440
that does all of this for you.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.320
They could have done something like that.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.320
This is genius.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.780
And I would love to see this happen.

15:11.780 --> 15:16.120
And I would love to see other desktops go, wait, what are they cooking over there?

15:16.120 --> 15:17.120
Yeah.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.120
What are they cooking?

15:18.120 --> 15:19.120
Maybe, maybe I should do some of that.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.120
Maybe I should do that.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.120
I don't know.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.120
I think that's pretty cool.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.800
I think that would be really solid.

15:23.800 --> 15:28.760
I'm going to try to put, I think I have recorded Wimpy's new settings sync solution.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.180
I'll try to get that put in the post-show so that way if you guys are curious, stick

15:31.180 --> 15:34.480
around for the post-show where Wimpy discusses how he's doing this essentially today.

15:34.480 --> 15:36.520
But this would be baked into the desktop level.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.640
Would you be tempted to give it a shot?

15:38.640 --> 15:39.640
Yeah.

15:39.640 --> 15:40.640
I mean, I think so.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.620
I don't know if I would use it long-term or not, but with this number of like that kind

15:44.620 --> 15:49.120
of integration, if I've already got all of my environment settings and then you can,

15:49.120 --> 15:52.260
you already have it there syncing, so why not put your dot files on it?

15:52.260 --> 15:54.940
Why not put in everything that you need that you want to carry with you?

15:54.940 --> 15:59.600
You pull up a new laptop, you install Plasma, you get the settings configured and boom,

15:59.600 --> 16:00.600
you're rolling.

16:00.600 --> 16:01.600
That sounds awesome.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.600
Yeah.

16:02.600 --> 16:08.160
And if you do one login and all your settings syncs and your file syncs set up, this for

16:08.160 --> 16:13.160
me makes like investing, even if Nextcloud does have a few issues, like I could build

16:13.160 --> 16:17.880
backup systems around that, like I can figure out ways, especially if I can take in regular

16:17.880 --> 16:22.440
snapshots before updates and whatnot, like there are ways to mitigate any potential downfall

16:22.440 --> 16:24.840
I might find if they get to this level of integration.

16:24.840 --> 16:29.680
And if the other desktops ever consider this, or even if just the file manager project implemented

16:29.680 --> 16:32.720
this or a few other projects do this, this would be huge.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.460
I love it.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.460
So you can find out more.

16:35.460 --> 16:38.880
There's not a lot of meat to it yet because none of the work has been done.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.320
This is all just theoretical.

16:40.320 --> 16:44.500
They don't even have the common API yet, so it's not really all that close.

16:44.500 --> 16:48.920
One other story just because I don't really think it affects a lot of us, but I think

16:48.920 --> 16:50.520
we'll all collectively like to roll our eyes.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.520
Get ready.

16:51.520 --> 16:52.520
Get ready.

16:52.520 --> 16:56.680
Do one preparatory blink and now roll your eyes.

16:56.680 --> 17:03.340
McAfee Virus Scanner is allowing remote code execution as root on Linux.

17:03.340 --> 17:07.080
So when you get that virus scanner that you don't need for your Linux box, taking up resources

17:07.080 --> 17:12.120
that you don't really have available, scanning files for the Windows users, it turns out

17:12.120 --> 17:17.360
that if you have the Intel McAfee Virus Scan Enterprise for Linux, it can be compromised

17:17.360 --> 17:20.480
by remote attackers due to a number of security vulnerabilities.

17:20.480 --> 17:21.920
Not one, not two.

17:21.920 --> 17:26.180
Some of these vulnerabilities can be chained together to allow remote code execution as

17:26.180 --> 17:27.180
root.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.180
Oh no.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.180
Yeah.

17:29.180 --> 17:36.160
So basically everything they've released from 2015 till now has the vulnerability.

17:36.160 --> 17:40.640
The only difference from the older release appears to be updating a newer version of

17:40.640 --> 17:43.400
Lib C, which makes exploiting these vulnerabilities even easier.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.400
Oh boy.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.400
Yikes.

17:45.400 --> 17:46.400
Yeah.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.200
So that's what's up.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.200
And now it's out in the wild.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.560
It's known about.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.080
There are CVEs and all that to track.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.680
So you've probably already been informed about this if you run it.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.520
But they also have a rundown.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.520
It is 10 vulnerabilities.

17:59.520 --> 18:00.520
10.

18:00.520 --> 18:01.520
Dang.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.520
Yeah.

18:02.520 --> 18:03.520
Each one got its own CVE.

18:03.520 --> 18:04.520
So that's brilliant.

18:04.520 --> 18:10.040
And the other thing that's just wonderful and it's so great because before I say this,

18:10.040 --> 18:13.400
you're not going to be too shocked when I say it, but you have to remember in the context

18:13.400 --> 18:15.280
in which this product is sold.

18:15.280 --> 18:19.500
This is sold as a security product to run on your enterprise servers that are connected

18:19.500 --> 18:22.080
to the internet to make them more secure.

18:22.080 --> 18:25.120
It is implicitly sold to make your server more secure.

18:25.120 --> 18:29.880
And so when you are designing enterprise software, it's not shareware, it's not $9, it's hundreds

18:29.880 --> 18:34.520
of thousands even with yearly annual subscriptions and support.

18:34.520 --> 18:38.100
And you are designing an application to be sold in this environment.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.000
You build it for security.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.880
And the way, just basic way you could start that is run the individual services as unprivileged

18:45.880 --> 18:46.880
users.

18:46.880 --> 18:47.880
But not McAfee.

18:47.880 --> 18:48.880
Nope.

18:48.880 --> 18:49.880
Nope.

18:49.880 --> 18:54.880
Not one folks, but two separate services running as root and only one running as an unprivileged

18:54.880 --> 18:55.880
user called Nails.

18:55.880 --> 18:56.880
Nails.

18:56.880 --> 19:01.920
And the great thing is the main scanner service runs as root and listens on a local Unix socket.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.840
So that's beautiful.

19:03.840 --> 19:07.760
So if you get on the box, if you use any other vulnerability to get local access to any of

19:07.760 --> 19:10.800
the other nine, if you use any of the other nine vulnerabilities to get local access to

19:10.800 --> 19:14.760
the box, you then can just access the local web server, the server web server listening

19:14.760 --> 19:17.240
on local host running as root, which is brilliant.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.760
Then the main scanner service also runs as root.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.120
That's just brilliant.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.440
And then the web servers, there's another web server that runs as the user Nails also

19:24.440 --> 19:29.920
listening on 0.0.0 on port 55443.

19:29.920 --> 19:34.660
Inner process communication is basically a web server that sits on top of other pieces

19:34.660 --> 19:35.660
underneath it.

19:35.660 --> 19:39.720
And when the user makes a request to the web server, the request is reformatted and sent

19:39.720 --> 19:40.720
to the root service.

19:40.720 --> 19:44.560
And then the user is shown the response rendered in an HTML template.

19:44.560 --> 19:48.800
The web interface doesn't do much to limit what data a malicious user could send to the

19:48.800 --> 19:49.800
root service.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.460
So you can, you could probably figure out a way to just use the web service, whatever

19:52.460 --> 19:56.600
you want in there, and it'll just pass it right along to the thing running as root.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.600
Just passes it right.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.600
Here you go.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.600
Here you go.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.600
Right.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.600
It is Ryan.

20:01.600 --> 20:02.600
Yeah, it's just brilliant.

20:02.600 --> 20:07.640
It's built as a product to make your Linux enterprise servers more secure with the intention

20:07.640 --> 20:10.880
these boxes are likely connected to the web or, you know, because they're mail servers

20:10.880 --> 20:12.440
and things like that.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.640
And this is what they do.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.000
Crazy.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.600
Well, expected though.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.840
Don't don't if you're going to run antivirus on Linux, just use Clam antivirus.

20:21.840 --> 20:22.840
All right.

20:22.840 --> 20:23.840
Do me a favor.

20:23.840 --> 20:24.840
Do you a favor.

20:24.840 --> 20:25.840
Don't make Chris mad.

20:25.840 --> 20:29.040
Don't don't spend thousands and thousands of dollars to McAfee.

20:29.040 --> 20:32.240
Go do a donation to the Clam AV project and call it good.

20:32.240 --> 20:35.120
Clam AV has been around for years.

20:35.120 --> 20:38.600
It gets updated like nobody's business.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.000
It's easy to integrate.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.440
It doesn't have a ton of overhead compared to these things.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.400
And it's open source.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.160
You just I mean, it's just there is not a competitive market.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.160
I don't know why.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.320
I don't like I've seen this before.

20:50.320 --> 20:53.420
I've seen people asking about antivirus before.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.240
If you must run antivirus, use Clam Clam AV.

20:56.240 --> 21:00.360
And if you need to spend money on antivirus, give a donation to the Clam AV project.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.360
Problem solved.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.360
All right.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.360
Hmm.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.360
Go ahead.

21:04.360 --> 21:05.360
Yes.

21:05.360 --> 21:12.040
I have found several third party Clam AV virus repositories.

21:12.040 --> 21:17.480
There's one that I'm using on my personal squid proxy at home.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.160
Oh, you scan all the data.

21:19.160 --> 21:22.160
How do you know it's a legit the third party?

21:22.160 --> 21:23.160
How do you know?

21:23.160 --> 21:24.160
Like, how do you find these?

21:24.160 --> 21:26.860
And how do you know they're OK to use?

21:26.860 --> 21:33.680
This one I they have paid repository parts and they mentioned something about I think

21:33.680 --> 21:35.280
U.S. government using them or something like that.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.280
This is like a business.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.920
This is like a this is like a way they generate revenue.

21:38.920 --> 21:39.920
Yes.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.920
Oh, OK.

21:40.920 --> 21:41.920
Interesting.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.280
So they're like a curator for Clam AV databases.

21:44.280 --> 21:47.720
And can you use multiple Clam AV database sources?

21:47.720 --> 21:48.720
You should.

21:48.720 --> 21:54.240
All it is is adding into the Clam as the fresh Clam config.

21:54.240 --> 21:55.240
Yeah.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.240
Fresh Clam.

21:56.240 --> 21:57.240
That's right.

21:57.240 --> 21:58.240
That's right.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.240
Yep.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.240
Wow.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.240
It's been a long time.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.240
So that is that is really interesting.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.240
I don't think I ever got down that far in the rabbit hole when I messed around with Clam

22:04.240 --> 22:05.240
AV.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.240
Thankfully.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.240
I just set up a cron job.

22:07.240 --> 22:10.000
Let me see if I can find the website and I'll link it to you guys in the IRC.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.680
Yeah, of course.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.360
Like Ike says, you can still charge for open source.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.760
Of course, Clam AV could choose to sell it if they wanted to.

22:15.760 --> 22:16.760
They just don't.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.320
It's just right there in your repo.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.320
I love it.

22:19.320 --> 22:22.400
There's a lot of value adds like we're seeing here.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.820
That is really a thing, though.

22:23.820 --> 22:27.680
Just those root services, Wes, that really runs as root and then claims to make your

22:27.680 --> 22:28.680
computer more secure.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.680
Just I know.

22:29.680 --> 22:30.680
Right.

22:30.680 --> 22:31.680
And walk away.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.680
Walk away.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.640
I mean, I mean, I only run as root, but that's because I know what I'm doing.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.160
You know what you're doing.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.560
You meant to delete those files.

22:37.560 --> 22:38.560
Yeah.

22:38.560 --> 22:39.560
Didn't want them anymore.

22:39.560 --> 22:40.560
Oh, man.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.320
You know what I get grumpy at, actually?

22:42.320 --> 22:44.160
This is such a first world problem.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.800
But like when I had this is such a first world problem.

22:46.800 --> 22:52.120
But when I have like a lot of packages to update and I pseudoed and then sometime during

22:52.120 --> 22:56.520
the build of an AOR package or something, the pseudo time window is expired.

22:56.520 --> 22:59.840
And then the package just sits there waiting while I reenter the password.

22:59.840 --> 23:03.520
Usually because I've walked away, I come back and then it's timed out again.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.160
And now it's asking for the root password.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.760
And I'm like, I don't I don't know.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.160
I never log in as root.

23:08.160 --> 23:12.480
I set up some crazy password I generated like, oh, come on.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.480
Can't you remember?

23:13.480 --> 23:15.280
So I'm always tempted to just pseudo the whole session.

23:15.280 --> 23:18.200
But then, of course, now now the package manager is yelling at me.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.080
You really shouldn't run this as root.

23:20.080 --> 23:24.240
To run this as root, you must do tack tack and come on.

23:24.240 --> 23:27.320
It's like it's like my it's like the way my truck beeps at me when I'm driving down my

23:27.320 --> 23:28.960
driveway to empty my garbage can.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.920
It's like, you don't have your seatbelt on.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.240
You don't have a seatbelt on.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.240
I know.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.240
It knows best.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.240
Just trust the system.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.280
Oh, man.

23:37.280 --> 23:39.480
Speaking of the system, help break the system.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.800
The duopoly that is the mobile industry.

23:41.800 --> 23:47.840
Go over to linux.ting.com and sign up for mobile that makes sense.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.780
This is a gift you could give because the SIM cards are like nine dollars.

23:51.780 --> 23:55.380
The phones are they have a whole range of phones starting like 20 bucks after you go

23:55.380 --> 23:58.440
to linux.ting.com all the way up to the Cadillacs.

23:58.440 --> 24:02.040
Linux.ting.com will take twenty five dollars off a device or give you service credit in

24:02.040 --> 24:05.800
twenty five dollars if you bring a phone or a tablet.

24:05.800 --> 24:08.860
I was just this is going to be a funny story.

24:08.860 --> 24:11.560
So this is I have just last week.

24:11.560 --> 24:17.480
I have a new use for Ting, which I've had when I got ages ago, I got an old iPad like

24:17.480 --> 24:20.300
air or something.

24:20.300 --> 24:22.400
It's like the first iPad Air.

24:22.400 --> 24:25.920
And this is what I'm using when I fly my DGI drone.

24:25.920 --> 24:29.160
So I have a nice big screen to view the DGI drone on.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.720
Here's the thing, Wes.

24:30.720 --> 24:34.800
There are regions like where the studio is at that are restricted air and I have to sign

24:34.800 --> 24:37.520
in and authorize myself before I can fly in that area.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.020
And you've got to have data.

24:39.020 --> 24:43.720
So here I am like a jerk out in the freezing temperatures with my drone and I can't take

24:43.720 --> 24:48.200
off, I can't fly because I don't have I don't have data on my iPad.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.200
So that took about 30 hot seconds to fix.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.720
So I get a SIM card from Ting.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.240
I put it in the iPad.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.800
It's six dollars a month for the line.

24:54.800 --> 24:56.400
I never pay for phone minutes.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.260
I never pay for text messages.

24:58.260 --> 25:02.080
And for the once a week, this thing has to hit the cellular tower to authorize a login

25:02.080 --> 25:03.080
token.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.020
I will pay for the, you know, I mean, I'm not I'm nothing basically.

25:06.020 --> 25:10.060
And if I if I was a new customer, if I went to Linux.ting.com and I signed up for a device

25:10.060 --> 25:15.960
like this, just like a tablet that has like a LTE connection as a backup, you probably

25:15.960 --> 25:19.240
wouldn't even use that first twenty five dollars for a couple of months.

25:19.240 --> 25:20.840
It's just six dollars for the line.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.400
And then your usage on top of that.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.200
And there's no contract nor the termination fee.

25:24.200 --> 25:28.400
They got great customer service, CDMA and GSM networks to choose from.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.200
I know it's so cool.

25:30.200 --> 25:34.980
And they have great tech tips and tricks on their blog and often things about giveaways

25:34.980 --> 25:35.980
and whatnot.

25:35.980 --> 25:37.280
So check it out.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.600
Go to Linux.ting.com.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.600
You can find a device for a great value if you just want to get the same like I did.

25:41.600 --> 25:44.960
I just you know, when I got the iPad ages ago, I was like, well, I want GPS.

25:44.960 --> 25:48.200
I don't really care about the cellular, but I do want GPS.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.200
Exactly.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.200
And so I thought, well, maybe.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.200
All right, fine.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.200
I'll do it.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.040
And then for years, since I've just sat there, never with a SIM card in it.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.320
And then just a week ago, I'm like, you know what?

25:57.320 --> 25:58.320
I got a reason.

25:58.320 --> 25:59.320
It's six bucks a month.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.320
Why not?

26:00.320 --> 26:01.320
Now you're glad you got it.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.320
I really am.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.320
Yeah, it's so awesome.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.400
You can just anything like that for your main phone to just a little device you want to

26:05.400 --> 26:06.880
add data to Linux.ting.com.

26:06.880 --> 26:12.600
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged Program.

26:12.600 --> 26:13.600
Linux.ting.com.

26:13.600 --> 26:19.640
I don't really I don't really have much to say about this next story other than what

26:19.640 --> 26:24.440
does kind of jump out at me is the register is like like bipolar about its coverage when

26:24.440 --> 26:25.440
it comes to Linus.

26:25.440 --> 26:30.060
It's either Linus is the devil bringing rage to the Internet and scaring people away from

26:30.060 --> 26:35.920
open source development because of his toad, or he's Santa Claus and he's saving Christmas.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.720
It's literally the range for the register.

26:37.720 --> 26:42.480
So this headline reads, Linus Torvalds releases the biggest ever Linux 4.9 and then saves

26:42.480 --> 26:43.480
Christmas.

26:43.480 --> 26:49.360
Now, wasn't it just a few headlines ago where Linus was the worst human being on the Internet?

26:49.360 --> 26:50.360
Just what Christmas needed.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.360
Yeah.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.980
So Linus writes, I'm pretty sure this is the biggest release we've ever had.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.640
It's definitely at least the biggest in the number of commits.

26:56.640 --> 26:59.080
This was written on the kernel mailing list.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.480
Other notable additions this time around include support for the Raspberry Pi Zero.

27:02.480 --> 27:03.480
Hey.

27:03.480 --> 27:06.360
Oh, plus another few 28 arm devices.

27:06.360 --> 27:10.800
There's also things in there that you might be interested in, like the AMD GPU support

27:10.800 --> 27:13.080
to enable the use of virtual displays from GPUs.

27:13.080 --> 27:17.520
Hey, oh, William, we might be we might be in your you're hearing your activation key

27:17.520 --> 27:18.520
from time to time.

27:18.520 --> 27:21.520
I think that might have been you.

27:21.520 --> 27:24.400
Anyways, here's the thing, Wes.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.600
You got to hustle in because Torvalds has also confirmed a small change the development

27:27.600 --> 27:31.640
process starting with Linux 4.10 in the form of a shorter than usual merge window.

27:31.640 --> 27:32.640
Get ready, Wes.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.780
These kernel patches got to get in.

27:34.780 --> 27:39.120
The usual two week merge window will close on December 25th, which might look familiar

27:39.120 --> 27:41.360
as Linus says, because it is Christmas Day.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.280
And so if you're originally from Finland like he is, it's the day you relax.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.960
Well, so might as well just might as well finish up that.

27:46.960 --> 27:47.960
Yeah, I guess.

27:47.960 --> 27:48.960
Right.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.360
So because the real part, he says, happens on Christmas Eve.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.440
I will certainly stop pulling on the 23rd at the latest.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.280
So you better hurry up if you want to get your patches in.

27:56.280 --> 28:01.960
Hurry up, Wes, because Christmas, Christmas is going to affect the merge window.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.120
And this is the story I'm actually I mean, yeah, a new kernel.

28:04.120 --> 28:08.460
This is the story I'm more excited about because it it really actually represents a four year

28:08.460 --> 28:10.800
completion of a goal for crossover.

28:10.800 --> 28:13.160
And it's a major milestone for wine.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.720
Crossover has launched version 16.

28:15.720 --> 28:19.800
Crossover is the code weavers product that gives you a graphical front end to set up

28:19.800 --> 28:22.460
Windows applications with guides and scripts and downloaders.

28:22.460 --> 28:26.160
It's a great product and it uses bottles to isolate them so you don't break your different

28:26.160 --> 28:28.080
wine environments for different apps.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.860
And they have finally I know you might think this is funny, but they finally after four

28:30.860 --> 28:36.560
years nailed Office 2013 support, or at least damn close.

28:36.560 --> 28:42.480
And I suppose if I was going to want to run Office on Linux, 2013, that would be fine.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.720
That was the last good one.

28:43.720 --> 28:44.720
So that's fine.

28:44.720 --> 28:50.280
And the other big note here is it's shipping wine 2.0, which is I don't think technically

28:50.280 --> 28:51.280
out.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.280
Yeah.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.280
Right.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.360
I thought wine 2.0 was still in development, but they're shipping wine.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.000
They're using a wine 2.0 code base.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.400
Now this makes sense because a lot of what code weavers does goes upstream to the wine

29:01.400 --> 29:02.400
project.

29:02.400 --> 29:05.400
So they would be very likely maybe running on stuff that hasn't been accepted upstream

29:05.400 --> 29:06.400
yet.

29:06.400 --> 29:10.640
They say they're also going to be focusing on Android support and DirectX 11.

29:10.640 --> 29:11.640
Yeah.

29:11.640 --> 29:14.680
Android support and DirectX 11 in 2017.

29:14.680 --> 29:21.040
It's pretty cool to see this development all going upstream and getting better.

29:21.040 --> 29:25.120
And thankfully I don't have occasion to use wine that much in my day-to-day life.

29:25.120 --> 29:29.840
But if you have office needs support for that kind of stuff, interop, this goes a long way.

29:29.840 --> 29:35.760
Where does Crossover go once most of what we need to do is online?

29:35.760 --> 29:39.760
If I can now run QuickBooks online, I don't really need Crossover as much to use QuickBooks

29:39.760 --> 29:40.760
on the desktop.

29:40.760 --> 29:45.880
And if I can now run Office in the web and Office on Google stuff, do I really need to

29:45.880 --> 29:49.960
go bend over backwards to run Office 2013?

29:49.960 --> 29:50.960
Absolutely in the business.

29:50.960 --> 29:51.960
That's still got to be a use case.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.960
But it feels like that's going to be...

29:53.960 --> 29:54.960
It's diminishing, right?

29:54.960 --> 29:58.920
So that must be why they're switching to Android, right?

29:58.920 --> 30:02.800
I remember when they announced a Mac version, I was like, well, shit, there goes the Linux

30:02.800 --> 30:03.800
version.

30:03.800 --> 30:04.800
It's going to go down.

30:04.800 --> 30:05.800
But really they've done a great job.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.520
They've kept it really feature complete on both sides.

30:07.520 --> 30:08.520
Yeah, totally.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.600
So if anybody could do it, it's probably them.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.400
But it does seem interesting that they're moving to Android.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.640
And does that mean Windows applications on Android?

30:14.640 --> 30:15.640
On Android?

30:15.640 --> 30:18.600
Because I can't imagine that would be pleasant.

30:18.600 --> 30:22.200
What Android device are they thinking of where that's a thing you need?

30:22.200 --> 30:23.960
A tablet?

30:23.960 --> 30:27.080
A laptop?

30:27.080 --> 30:28.080
Is it just for...

30:28.080 --> 30:30.800
Actually, I'll speculate a little bit here.

30:30.800 --> 30:36.320
I bet you the way they do this is with a strict focus on certain games.

30:36.320 --> 30:42.480
So they're going to bring a couple of Windows favorites to Android, and it'll be powered

30:42.480 --> 30:43.480
by crossover, I bet.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.780
It might even just be a completely wrapped solution.

30:45.780 --> 30:50.000
So they'll have the individual app in the Play Store, and it's using a crossover backend

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
to run.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Huh?

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
How about that?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.000
That would be interesting.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
I think that was Chris's first 2017 prediction.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
Yeah.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
Wow.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
I think I just did that.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
You heard it here first, the Linux unplugged.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.720
Yeah, I just wasted a good one for the predictions episode.

31:01.720 --> 31:07.320
And then this one would be interesting for those of you running Core OS up on Digital

31:07.320 --> 31:08.320
Ocean or on your own switch.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.360
We don't know anyone who does that.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.980
No, no, no.

31:11.980 --> 31:12.980
This is huge, though.

31:12.980 --> 31:19.280
Core OS developer Alex has announced that they're switching the name to Container Linux.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.760
No more Core OS.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.560
Container Linux by Core OS.

31:23.560 --> 31:27.760
Yeah, they're doing a little Plasma desktop by KDE on us here.

31:27.760 --> 31:32.040
The decision to rename the OS was made earlier during the Tectonic Summit 2016 event presented

31:32.040 --> 31:37.760
by Core OS, and they also unveiled the next-gen Core OS Tectonic Enterprise Kubernetes solution

31:37.760 --> 31:41.540
for deploying and managing containers at scale.

31:41.540 --> 31:42.540
Does that mean anything to you?

31:42.540 --> 31:45.720
I mean, if you have a lot of containers, you got to have something that tells them what

31:45.720 --> 31:46.720
to do.

31:46.720 --> 31:47.720
Yeah.

31:47.720 --> 31:50.920
And they should be running on Container Linux.

31:50.920 --> 31:51.920
It's hard to say still.

31:51.920 --> 31:52.920
I'm not used to it.

31:52.920 --> 31:53.920
All right.

31:53.920 --> 32:00.480
I'm not huge on the name, but it definitely, it's like calling it what it does.

32:00.480 --> 32:04.000
And so, hey, what's the best Linux to run containers on?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.520
I hear containers are the big thing.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.520
Well, there's Container Linux.

32:06.520 --> 32:07.520
Container Linux, of course.

32:07.520 --> 32:08.520
Just use it.

32:08.520 --> 32:13.560
Sounds like they're trying to copy Noah's nick, that it's like Kernel Linux, Container

32:13.560 --> 32:14.560
Linux.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.560
Yeah, maybe.

32:15.560 --> 32:16.560
Maybe.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.240
I wonder how this is going to affect people that are running Core OS now, because Core

32:19.240 --> 32:21.980
OS kind of gets these rolling updates.

32:21.980 --> 32:25.960
Will you just be one day running Container Linux and no longer Core OS?

32:25.960 --> 32:27.520
Like all the branding will just get refreshed?

32:27.520 --> 32:29.400
Let's see OS release just changes.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.000
I mean, it's just branding.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Yeah.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Yeah.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
Yeah.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
I know.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.000
I agree.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.000
It's an interesting change.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
It's an obvious, like, try to play for...

32:38.000 --> 32:39.960
I feel like there's been a lot of renames, rebrandings recently.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.520
TrueOS from PCBSTD.

32:41.520 --> 32:42.520
Yeah.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.520
Yeah.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.720
2016 has been rough for a lot of people, man.

32:45.720 --> 32:48.600
It's been a rough year for a lot of people.

32:48.600 --> 32:51.560
There's nobody in the lug there that's running Core OS, right?

32:51.560 --> 32:53.960
Nobody, I would imagine.

32:53.960 --> 32:54.960
I've played with it.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.160
I've checked it out.

32:56.160 --> 33:01.960
They've got some of the actually most interesting things about Container Linux is the technology

33:01.960 --> 33:07.040
they've open sourced to make Container Linux possible, etcd and some of their other –

33:07.040 --> 33:08.040
Yes, definitely.

33:08.040 --> 33:09.040
Yeah.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.040
That's where some of the cool stuff is.

33:10.040 --> 33:14.400
They've also done some interesting work in trying to use like Secure Boot or TPMs

33:14.400 --> 33:15.400
to help.

33:15.400 --> 33:19.280
So you are deploying in your own data center that you can verify that only your software

33:19.280 --> 33:22.880
is running on your hardware, which I think that's interesting.

33:22.880 --> 33:23.880
Mm-hmm.

33:23.880 --> 33:24.880
Mm-hmm.

33:24.880 --> 33:25.880
EvolvOS to Solus.

33:25.880 --> 33:26.880
But we don't mention that one.

33:26.880 --> 33:27.880
No, we don't.

33:27.880 --> 33:28.880
We don't mention EvolvOS.

33:28.880 --> 33:29.880
It's a pretty good name, though.

33:29.880 --> 33:30.880
Although, you know what?

33:30.880 --> 33:32.360
I think Solus is growing on me more.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.360
Yeah, me too.

33:33.360 --> 33:34.480
I actually think I like Solus better.

33:34.480 --> 33:38.120
So I think long term, I think it was a better play, Ike.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.360
You know, speaking of Solus, we should talk about that.

33:40.360 --> 33:41.360
We actually –

33:41.360 --> 33:42.360
That's on the docket.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.120
That is really what I'm looking forward to the most today because there is some ridiculous

33:45.120 --> 33:47.720
shenanigans going down, and I'm not going to have it.

33:47.720 --> 33:52.080
I'm not going to have this turn into some sort of community that's productive and with

33:52.080 --> 33:53.680
users benefiting.

33:53.680 --> 33:54.680
That's not good for the show.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.000
That's what we have to think about here.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.560
So let's take a moment before we go into that next subject.

33:58.560 --> 34:01.540
I was just mentioning DigitalOcean, DigitalOcean.com.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.780
Go there and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED after you create an account and then apply

34:04.780 --> 34:07.480
this to your balance and you get a $10 credit.

34:07.480 --> 34:11.240
CoreOS, which is now Container Linux, up on DigitalOcean.

34:11.240 --> 34:14.080
This was one of the first times I really got insight, too, after DigitalOcean became a

34:14.080 --> 34:17.920
sponsor and how they work upstream with a project, and I was like really impressed by

34:17.920 --> 34:18.920
that.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.400
Obviously, other things that really get me about DigitalOcean is how fast you can spin

34:21.400 --> 34:25.920
up a Linux server on demand when you want one, how great their interface is to manage

34:25.920 --> 34:30.240
all of this, and the solidness in which the platform has performed for me now that I've

34:30.240 --> 34:31.240
been using it for years.

34:31.240 --> 34:34.760
Like, that's another thing about it that I don't really mention in these reads, but

34:34.760 --> 34:37.440
it's – if you're new to it, you want to – well, how reliable is it?

34:37.440 --> 34:38.440
But they're not a newcomer.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.440
They've been doing this a while now.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.520
They've gotten damn good at it.

34:40.520 --> 34:43.800
They were one of the first, and it really has paid off for them.

34:43.800 --> 34:48.800
They were one of the first early-ons to invest all SSDs back when – I mean, this is years

34:48.800 --> 34:52.520
ago now when SSDs were extremely expensive, especially in the enterprise, and they still

34:52.520 --> 34:53.520
are in the enterprise.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.840
But DigitalOcean realized that this is a key part to the performance value.

34:56.840 --> 35:01.600
And so that's – when I say you can get a droplet for $5 a month, that's all SSD-backed.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.960
All of them have 40 gigabit E connection to the hypervisor.

35:03.960 --> 35:08.400
They've got fast processors, and you can also price a rig for three cents an hour,

35:08.400 --> 35:14.760
which is two gigs of RAM and multiple cores, and it's just phenomenal how fast it all

35:14.760 --> 35:18.640
is when you combine that disk I.O. with that network connection, that great interface,

35:18.640 --> 35:23.160
and the API, which allows you to do so many things from your phone or the command line

35:23.160 --> 35:24.520
that just make you more productive.

35:24.520 --> 35:28.040
I always joke about this, but, like, there's things I can do.

35:28.040 --> 35:33.640
I just go to a tab and drop down a Guake terminal, and I can issue commands that start and stop

35:33.640 --> 35:36.840
servers that make streams connect all over the place.

35:36.840 --> 35:40.840
I don't – and I can do that from any of my machines that I have Guake on and an IRC

35:40.840 --> 35:41.840
client.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.840
And it's so awesome.

35:42.840 --> 35:43.840
Just right at your fingertips.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.760
It's so much faster than going to a web page and logging in.

35:46.760 --> 35:49.960
It's just – I hit the tilde button, and I issue a command.

35:49.960 --> 35:53.240
And if you're in the chat room before a show, you see me issue those commands.

35:53.240 --> 35:56.600
Those are spinning up DigitalOcean droplets on the back end, and then they're kicking

35:56.600 --> 36:02.160
off scripts connecting to the endpoints that we're streaming to using their API.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.360
And I use it multiple times a day.

36:04.360 --> 36:05.520
It's so brilliant.

36:05.520 --> 36:09.320
And then you combine that with the speed, the reliability, the great price, and all

36:09.320 --> 36:12.920
of the fantastic documentation, and the fact that they stay up to date with the latest

36:12.920 --> 36:16.000
and greatest Linux distributions and FreeBSD.

36:16.000 --> 36:20.880
And then they have block storage on top of it all, up to 16 terabytes of SSD back storage,

36:20.880 --> 36:21.880
which is nuts.

36:21.880 --> 36:27.560
And if you just want to even just mess around at all with LVM or ZFS or any kind of disk

36:27.560 --> 36:28.560
orchestration system –

36:28.560 --> 36:30.960
Go make yourself a nice big array, play with it for a couple hours.

36:30.960 --> 36:31.960
Yeah, man.

36:31.960 --> 36:36.600
I was watching a demo of a system that had – essentially, to the system, it appeared

36:36.600 --> 36:38.840
to be 30 different block devices.

36:38.840 --> 36:44.880
And that's – for pennies on the hour, that's a system that you couldn't replicate even

36:44.880 --> 36:46.320
at some of the most high-end IT shops.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.320
I can't pop one of those right now.

36:47.320 --> 36:48.320
No.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.840
No, it's been so awesome to be able to go there and then play with the latest and greatest

36:50.840 --> 36:51.840
software too.

36:51.840 --> 36:56.420
And if you're a total beginner, you can deploy an entire application stack with Linux installed

36:56.420 --> 36:58.000
and all the stuff you want.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.560
And if you're messing around with containers, there's really no better option out there.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.840
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

37:03.840 --> 37:08.360
It's one word, you apply it to your account, you get a $10 credit, DigitalOcean.com.

37:08.360 --> 37:12.040
And thanks, DigitalOcean, for sponsoring the unplugged shenanigans.

37:12.040 --> 37:15.600
So I saw this Google Plus post from this Wimpy character – oh, I'm sorry, I think he goes

37:15.600 --> 37:17.160
by Martin on Google Plus.

37:17.160 --> 37:23.360
He says, I'm extremely pleased that Solace and Ubuntu Mate are deepening the collaboration,

37:23.360 --> 37:26.920
so much so that I said these words in a recent This Week in Solace post.

37:26.920 --> 37:30.720
Ubuntu Mate have been working to – oh, I should have Wimpy read this in his voice.

37:30.720 --> 37:32.200
That's – why am I reading this?

37:32.200 --> 37:36.000
Wimpy, do you have this post handy enough that you could read it for us in your own

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
Wimpy brand?

37:37.000 --> 37:38.480
I could do it in a few seconds.

37:38.480 --> 37:42.400
Yeah, that'd be good, because I could – why should I, if I could have it in your own voice?

37:42.400 --> 37:45.640
This is a great – and really, it's a great thing that's happening here.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.680
I've been teasing the whole episode.

37:47.680 --> 37:48.920
But that's because we're excited.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.200
I am very excited about this.

37:50.200 --> 37:54.080
And I think that the choice is right on both accounts.

37:54.080 --> 37:58.240
I will take this moment to pull up This Week in Solace that Wimpy is referencing, so we

37:58.240 --> 38:01.320
can show the pretty images on the stream.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.320
This is great.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.320
Okay.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.320
All right.

38:04.320 --> 38:09.840
So the words that I said in This Week in Solace to Josh Strobel were, Ubuntu Mate have been

38:09.840 --> 38:14.100
looking to replace the Mate menu, which was forked from Mint menu for some time.

38:14.100 --> 38:18.240
It's clear the Brisk menu, despite being in the very early stages of development, is

38:18.240 --> 38:22.920
the project that can achieve that, given the quality of work coming out of the Solace project.

38:22.920 --> 38:23.920
Wow.

38:23.920 --> 38:30.480
It's very complimentary towards Solace, and interesting that this is a departure from

38:30.480 --> 38:36.800
a menu that has its heritage in Linux Mint, something that's – when I saw it in Ubuntu

38:36.800 --> 38:39.080
Mate, I actually was glad to see it.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.240
Because I like that menu a lot.

38:40.240 --> 38:44.720
It's just – it does start – it is starting to feel old and slow.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.000
But I don't understand what's happening here.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
It's always been slow.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.480
I don't – I thought –

38:48.480 --> 38:49.940
It's comfortable.

38:49.940 --> 38:55.480
Solace seems like cats and dogs to me, to a certain degree, because Solace is – I

38:55.480 --> 38:56.480
don't know.

38:56.480 --> 38:59.480
This feels like an odd couple pairing to me, for some reason.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.480
I think it's fantastic.

39:00.480 --> 39:05.400
You know, Ubuntu Mate had come from kind of a – what was before, what we thought we

39:05.400 --> 39:08.640
could continue with, Solace kind of broke out on their own and does things their own

39:08.640 --> 39:09.640
way, their own style.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.920
It's kind of – that's kind of the schtick.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.040
Shall I give you the backstory here?

39:14.040 --> 39:17.720
And also, let's just touch on this.

39:17.720 --> 39:21.480
Although I posted these things about Solace, this isn't the only collaboration that's

39:21.480 --> 39:23.040
happening with Ubuntu Mate at the moment.

39:23.040 --> 39:30.000
We've got Don Foray, who's just completed doing some icon work for us, as well, which

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
–

39:31.000 --> 39:34.840
Not to interrupt, but Daniel is – Daniel is from Elementary OS.

39:34.840 --> 39:38.400
And Daniel did work on – it's like the Humanity icon theme originally.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.400
Right.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.400
That's his history.

39:40.400 --> 39:43.440
And so now he's working with the Mate project, just for people that don't know who Daniel

39:43.440 --> 39:44.440
is.

39:44.440 --> 39:45.440
Go ahead.

39:45.440 --> 39:48.960
So I'll explain a bit of the backstory with Solace first.

39:48.960 --> 39:55.080
So behind the scenes, what people don't see is that myself and Aiki are chatting fairly

39:55.080 --> 40:00.520
frequently about stuff, and we have collaborated on things in the past.

40:00.520 --> 40:06.360
What was started here by Aiki, we could have silently just let happen in the usual way

40:06.360 --> 40:08.400
that we get on with stuff.

40:08.400 --> 40:15.220
But recently, there's been an uptick of reporting in the online press about the divisions

40:15.220 --> 40:21.840
within the Linux community and projects working in silos on separate stuff and not collaborating.

40:21.840 --> 40:25.280
And that isn't actually how things work at all.

40:25.280 --> 40:31.680
So I decided to use some of these collaborations that are happening recently to sort of counter

40:31.680 --> 40:33.480
what we've been seeing in the press recently.

40:33.480 --> 40:34.480
Nice.

40:34.480 --> 40:40.880
So to point to that, when Aiki announced that he was going to make a Mate spin of Solace,

40:40.880 --> 40:48.440
I contacted Aiki and said, here's all of the things I did in Ubuntu Mate to change the

40:48.440 --> 40:49.440
branding.

40:49.440 --> 40:52.440
And this is probably stuff that you'll want to do.

40:52.440 --> 41:00.080
And I also watched his hackathon six hour video fest thing to see him actually do that

41:00.080 --> 41:05.680
initial enablement of Mate and send him some feedback based on what I'd seen.

41:05.680 --> 41:09.440
And I've also had some conversations with Josh as well around that.

41:09.440 --> 41:13.440
And Aiki and I have also had some conversations about, so Aiki is also submitting some pull

41:13.440 --> 41:18.880
requests to the Mate desktop to make notifications interactive.

41:18.880 --> 41:23.080
That was a recent thing that Aiki did and nobody knows about that because we didn't

41:23.080 --> 41:24.080
publicize it.

41:24.080 --> 41:25.080
That's huge.

41:25.080 --> 41:29.460
And, you know, Aiki and I've talked about some other areas where Aiki could contribute

41:29.460 --> 41:36.520
to the Mate desktop where he has specific skills and know how that the Mate team lack.

41:36.520 --> 41:46.560
And what I want to do is use the funding that the Ubuntu Mate project is generating to fund

41:46.560 --> 41:52.560
these people in the community that are capable of doing good work that benefits Mate or Ubuntu

41:52.560 --> 41:53.560
Mate.

41:53.560 --> 41:59.480
So if you want good quality code and a modern contemporary menu that's well implemented,

41:59.480 --> 42:04.960
you go to the guy that writes highly optimized code that understands the traditional desktop

42:04.960 --> 42:05.960
metaphor.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.680
That's Aiki at Solus.

42:07.680 --> 42:13.360
And if you want artwork, the standout project in the open source community for aesthetics

42:13.360 --> 42:14.880
and design is elementary.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.900
So that's who you go and talk to.

42:16.900 --> 42:23.480
So Ubuntu Mate is funding both those initiatives through our crowdfunding to improve Mate and

42:23.480 --> 42:28.240
Ubuntu Mate, but also ensure that some money goes to those projects as well.

42:28.240 --> 42:34.440
So they've got some money coming in to improve their projects and distributions as well.

42:34.440 --> 42:36.320
So that's the whole thing.

42:36.320 --> 42:40.760
So I think Aiki, that's me doing the complicated talky talky talky talky bit.

42:40.760 --> 42:41.760
Yeah.

42:41.760 --> 42:45.920
Now Aiki, which I love everything that Wimpy just said, but Aiki, don't you know better

42:45.920 --> 42:46.920
to compete?

42:46.920 --> 42:52.320
You're supposed to keep all of your best stuff for yourself and fork everything and relame

42:52.320 --> 42:57.360
it and keep it and just bloat the project with all of these own little independent islands

42:57.360 --> 42:58.800
of applications that you maintain.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.520
Don't you understand how this works?

43:00.520 --> 43:01.520
No.

43:01.520 --> 43:05.120
Well, I mean, even me, I don't fork things.

43:05.120 --> 43:09.320
Solus itself is independent and there's an immense value in competition.

43:09.320 --> 43:13.240
So when we brought out the Solus Mate edition, there was a few things that we had to look

43:13.240 --> 43:14.240
at.

43:14.240 --> 43:20.440
There is what I like to think of the reference implementation of Mate, which is oddly ironic.

43:20.440 --> 43:21.920
Wimpy and myself were talking about this earlier.

43:21.920 --> 43:28.800
Ubuntu Mate does diverge from stock Mate quite a bit, but it's the Mate when you think about

43:28.800 --> 43:29.800
it.

43:29.800 --> 43:34.480
And we decided to compete with them because then you set the bar at a certain level.

43:34.480 --> 43:38.080
Even if you're not there at the time, that's what you're aiming for.

43:38.080 --> 43:41.000
And in doing so, you start to expose areas of weakness.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.520
And for me, immediately, that was the menu.

43:43.520 --> 43:50.080
So we were going to be putting out a new release of Solus, a new snapshot, but the menu, I

43:50.080 --> 43:53.620
just couldn't get over my issues with it.

43:53.620 --> 43:59.160
So I then investigated the menu fork, which is, I believe, Wimpy did that himself.

43:59.160 --> 44:06.100
It basically took the existing menu and stripped out all the silliness, basically the hooks

44:06.100 --> 44:09.080
into package management and things like that.

44:09.080 --> 44:15.000
And even with all that done, it runs dog slow.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.440
I cannot bring myself to do it because I know what that code looks like.

44:18.440 --> 44:21.000
I've seen that over a few years.

44:21.000 --> 44:27.760
So I just got to a point where it's like, well, you know, I've written menus before.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.920
This can't be too difficult.

44:29.920 --> 44:30.920
So I started writing it up.

44:30.920 --> 44:36.240
And then, yeah, we agreed that the best thing to do is have that as something that's agnostic

44:36.240 --> 44:39.360
because that's something Solus is really trying to focus on lately.

44:39.360 --> 44:42.780
Make sure our software is agnostic, that everyone benefits from it.

44:42.780 --> 44:48.320
And in the way that we're doing this, so Avanti Mate through Wimpy is funding the development

44:48.320 --> 44:49.800
of Brisk.

44:49.800 --> 44:53.060
And in turn, that money would then be able to fund projects that Solus does or Solus

44:53.060 --> 44:54.720
gets invested in.

44:54.720 --> 45:00.780
So you kind of have this, to use a real corporate term here, you have like a virtuous cycle

45:00.780 --> 45:01.780
of growth.

45:01.780 --> 45:04.000
Some synergy is happening there.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Nice one, Aiki.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.000
Virtuous synergy.

45:07.000 --> 45:13.000
Aiki, the other question I have to ask you is, in 2016, we do docs now.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Everything's docs.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.080
This looks like a menu.

45:15.080 --> 45:17.480
Can you explain yourself?

45:17.480 --> 45:19.900
That's definitely a menu.

45:19.900 --> 45:24.520
So for the Mate desktop, you want something that's basically a little bit traditional.

45:24.520 --> 45:29.280
You want something that's nice, but by the same token, you don't want a full screen launcher.

45:29.280 --> 45:30.620
You don't want docs.

45:30.620 --> 45:32.100
You don't want dashes.

45:32.100 --> 45:36.800
You want to hit your Windows key, sorry, Super key, and have a menu to come up, and then

45:36.800 --> 45:37.800
you can just type.

45:37.800 --> 45:39.640
Or if you want to filter by category, you can do that.

45:39.640 --> 45:45.460
But you also want it to be fast because when I was testing the menu, when you're searching,

45:45.460 --> 45:48.320
there's a visible lag while it filters the results.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.320
It's not acceptable.

45:49.320 --> 45:50.320
Not in 2016.

45:50.320 --> 45:54.140
Oh, I am excited about this.

45:54.140 --> 45:55.720
This is going to be my favorite launcher.

45:55.720 --> 45:56.720
I can tell.

45:56.720 --> 46:00.400
I've got an i7 Nokia and it was lagging.

46:00.400 --> 46:01.400
Not acceptable.

46:01.400 --> 46:02.400
How?

46:02.400 --> 46:03.400
How?

46:03.400 --> 46:04.400
There's 16 gigs of RAM.

46:04.400 --> 46:07.700
And when Aiki and I were discussing this behind the scenes, you know, I explained I'd put as

46:07.700 --> 46:13.200
much effort into the Mate menu as I was prepared to invest because as Aiki says, it's spaghetti

46:13.200 --> 46:20.880
code and frankly, the hotspot in the loop that causes all of the lag in the Mint menu,

46:20.880 --> 46:23.560
I can't decipher what the heck is going on there.

46:23.560 --> 46:25.840
It's just impenetrable.

46:25.840 --> 46:28.760
So I was never going to touch that.

46:28.760 --> 46:33.800
And I've made a number of improvements to fix the way that it works and some integration.

46:33.800 --> 46:37.480
And there's some bugs with it in the way that it hooks into comps and things.

46:37.480 --> 46:42.680
And I simply can't fix that because of the wrong way things have been implemented there.

46:42.680 --> 46:47.320
So when I saw this, we've investigated other menus and launchers along the way, but when

46:47.320 --> 46:51.680
I saw this, I thought, I know this is going to be done right and we really need it.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.480
That's the thing that people keep.

46:53.480 --> 46:59.040
So along Ubuntu Mate's journey, there has been things you can identify as this is the

46:59.040 --> 47:01.120
pain point for people.

47:01.120 --> 47:05.360
And the pain point right now is people want a better advanced menu.

47:05.360 --> 47:06.600
And here it is.

47:06.600 --> 47:09.480
So Aiki's mentioned that we're offering some funding for this.

47:09.480 --> 47:15.840
And also my other end of the sort of the social contract on this is that I will package Brisk

47:15.840 --> 47:21.480
for Debian and Ubuntu and see that it gets into both the official archives for those.

47:21.480 --> 47:27.960
And replace the Mate menu with Brisk menu as soon as Brisk menu covers all of the core

47:27.960 --> 47:29.860
functionality of Mate menu.

47:29.860 --> 47:32.960
So I really will be using Brisk soon then.

47:32.960 --> 47:37.680
I really think this, the dock thing needs to go.

47:37.680 --> 47:44.200
I have a few docks, but I do it more like the Unity launcher, a persistent sidebar.

47:44.200 --> 47:46.040
Because I don't like this, am I going to have the screen space?

47:46.040 --> 47:49.400
And I don't like this constant, like I need to resize my window to make everything show

47:49.400 --> 47:52.880
up on the screen when I can just have a menu that I click and it drops down and it's just

47:52.880 --> 47:54.240
not even an issue for me.

47:54.240 --> 47:58.160
So Aiki, if I'm a Solace user, how does this work?

47:58.160 --> 48:01.600
Is this something that you'll ship eventually in a certain point release?

48:01.600 --> 48:03.720
Is this something that just rolls in?

48:03.720 --> 48:07.800
Is it something that I could get my hands on soon or do I have to wait a while?

48:07.800 --> 48:11.440
What do I expect as a Solace user for developments like this?

48:11.440 --> 48:16.640
So I basically put in about just under 24 hours into this.

48:16.640 --> 48:21.000
It started over the weekend and then back to work and whatnot.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.760
But most of the core of it's actually done in terms of having the category system and

48:24.760 --> 48:29.920
having the filtering and having it filter results by relevancy.

48:29.920 --> 48:34.000
Because that was one of the problems we had in the budget menu where we put a hack in

48:34.000 --> 48:40.880
to sort things by most used, but now it'll actually sort them by relevancy to your term.

48:40.880 --> 48:44.520
So in terms of pace, I mean, that's going to be out real soon.

48:44.520 --> 48:46.560
We'll go through a number of releases.

48:46.560 --> 48:52.240
Our first validation one, we'll go into the next Solace MATE ISO, and then we'll continue

48:52.240 --> 48:56.120
working with Martin just to make sure that these are the things that we want in there.

48:56.120 --> 48:57.280
Things are working as expected.

48:57.280 --> 49:02.000
So there are going to be a number of releases now that come out, and that's on GitHub like

49:02.000 --> 49:03.520
you'd expect it to be.

49:03.520 --> 49:09.000
And check in with Martin is going to be real simple because I just trust Aiki's judgment.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
So what is it written in?

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
C.

49:12.000 --> 49:19.680
Okay, so I was just, I was hoping to have a chance for us all to freak out when you

49:19.680 --> 49:20.680
said Python.

49:20.680 --> 49:24.280
I thought we were all going to have like a group like, oh, that's what we're replacing.

49:24.280 --> 49:25.280
Yeah, I know.

49:25.280 --> 49:26.280
That's what we're replacing.

49:26.280 --> 49:27.280
I know.

49:27.280 --> 49:29.800
I just, that's why I was, I thought if they're on the off chance, that would be a good gasping

49:29.800 --> 49:30.800
moment.

49:30.800 --> 49:31.800
But no, that makes sense.

49:31.800 --> 49:32.800
Well, that is super cool.

49:32.800 --> 49:34.360
There are other benefits to this menu as well.

49:34.360 --> 49:38.880
So we've had a couple of people that freaked out on Google plus basically saying when you

49:38.880 --> 49:43.560
first announced the Solus Mate edition, I knew this would detract resources and now

49:43.560 --> 49:44.560
you're not.

49:44.560 --> 49:48.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down a second.

49:48.320 --> 49:52.360
In terms of doing this menu, it's already benefited Budgie, which is going to sound

49:52.360 --> 49:57.160
really, really strange because it's not for Budgie, but it's already benefited and fixed

49:57.160 --> 50:01.600
two bugs already because I'm doing a clean room implementation without none of the old

50:01.600 --> 50:02.600
rust code.

50:02.600 --> 50:07.360
And you know, things are actually being done if you like by the book and I'm not using

50:07.360 --> 50:10.760
things that shouldn't be used like Valor and Python anyway.

50:10.760 --> 50:15.400
So one of the bugs it's already managed to fix in Budgie was the icon task list.

50:15.400 --> 50:19.720
It wasn't tracking the startup notifications of applications properly and canceling that

50:19.720 --> 50:20.800
notification.

50:20.800 --> 50:25.280
So in Budgie you'd have this timeout of 30 seconds with a spinny wheel of douchiness

50:25.280 --> 50:28.300
as I've come to call it and it just wouldn't go away.

50:28.300 --> 50:33.880
So it's like it's managed to fix that and now the run dialogue can properly track when

50:33.880 --> 50:36.200
the application is fully launched and encloses itself.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.760
And that's come from doing brisk menu.

50:38.760 --> 50:44.440
So you know, like there's all these little things, it is kind of like throwing a stone

50:44.440 --> 50:45.440
in a pond.

50:45.440 --> 50:48.280
You don't quite know where it's going to land and there's all these ripples coming out.

50:48.280 --> 50:51.980
You don't really know what they're going to affect, but it's already having positive effects

50:51.980 --> 50:56.160
and it's only like essentially a day old in terms of code.

50:56.160 --> 51:00.360
It sounds like things are proceeding very quickly.

51:00.360 --> 51:05.980
I think those kinds of projects too are the perfect thing for getting the more people

51:05.980 --> 51:06.980
talking about the distribution.

51:06.980 --> 51:11.320
So even if it didn't actually end up fixing a single bug on the main desktop, it still

51:11.320 --> 51:14.960
feels like it's good publicity for the project.

51:14.960 --> 51:15.960
There is that too.

51:15.960 --> 51:24.240
It's good to raise the profile of what are the emerging distributions, maybe the new

51:24.240 --> 51:31.560
guard of distributions for the next era of desktop Linux.

51:31.560 --> 51:34.260
Also it's important to point out you've talked about competition.

51:34.260 --> 51:42.600
Ikey and I do compete with one another, and we also both compete with elementary desktop,

51:42.600 --> 51:48.360
but all three distributions are talking to one another and collaborating with one another.

51:48.360 --> 51:54.360
And the competition is healthy because it drives us forward and where we can share things

51:54.360 --> 51:58.960
and where somebody solved a problem and we can all benefit from that, then we're moving

51:58.960 --> 52:03.680
together and the landscape is improving for everybody.

52:03.680 --> 52:10.300
And frankly, I don't really care if Ubuntu MATE is the dominant operating system because

52:10.300 --> 52:12.080
it simply won't be.

52:12.080 --> 52:16.760
But what I do care about is making sure that the MATE desktop remains relevant and has

52:16.760 --> 52:20.920
a future and it's initiatives like this that will help ensure that.

52:20.920 --> 52:25.720
And through other funding initiatives will also help ensure that we stay current with

52:25.720 --> 52:27.800
other technologies that are coming along as well.

52:27.800 --> 52:29.280
That's a great point.

52:29.280 --> 52:33.760
Yeah, they're just making sure that people want to keep using the desktop and a menu

52:33.760 --> 52:34.760
like this.

52:34.760 --> 52:38.040
If you're listening, it's a really just nice straightforward drop down menu that you're

52:38.040 --> 52:39.640
going to just recognize immediately.

52:39.640 --> 52:42.040
In response to the sort of commands you'd expect.

52:42.040 --> 52:43.040
So that's the brisk menu.

52:43.040 --> 52:45.800
We'll have a link in the show notes if you want to check it out.

52:45.800 --> 52:51.180
And to the point of publicity for the project, just before we move on, literally every time

52:51.180 --> 52:55.800
we have a conversation like this, I'm like, I've got to get this on a machine somewhere.

52:55.800 --> 52:57.040
It's time to try it out.

52:57.040 --> 52:58.040
Yeah.

52:58.040 --> 52:59.040
Yeah.

52:59.040 --> 53:04.280
And I am just I am so married to the AUR for production purposes, because I sit down here

53:04.280 --> 53:05.280
and I install three apps.

53:05.280 --> 53:07.520
I'm like, all right, this is I try them on like this is the one I'm going to try.

53:07.520 --> 53:10.240
This is the one I'm going to talk about today on on the next action show.

53:10.240 --> 53:14.800
And just being able to bust it out like that super quick is key because sometimes I'm already

53:14.800 --> 53:20.600
sitting down on the microphone just playing around on the live stream and that is a use.

53:20.600 --> 53:26.040
Are you suggesting you need a dedicated machine on which you can test the two solos solos

53:26.040 --> 53:27.040
distribution?

53:27.040 --> 53:28.040
Yeah, well, that would be true.

53:28.040 --> 53:29.040
I think he is saying that.

53:29.040 --> 53:33.720
Well, I had a I actually thought it'd be a good job for the Apollo, but I had something

53:33.720 --> 53:34.720
happen.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.120
Well, we'll talk at the end of the show.

53:36.120 --> 53:37.120
We'll make that happen.

53:37.120 --> 53:46.880
So Chris, AUR, while it was something that was distinctly not possible in the past, and

53:46.880 --> 53:51.600
personally, myself, I don't want to say that for mainstream users of solos, because we

53:51.600 --> 53:58.040
provide binary repos, you can now provide your own binary repos and solos as well with

53:58.040 --> 53:59.640
the new sol build tool.

53:59.640 --> 54:04.760
You can run it on any Linux distribution that has overlay fs in the kernel.

54:04.760 --> 54:06.900
And you can build solos packages from that.

54:06.900 --> 54:11.960
You can also create your own solos repos using that tool from any Linux distribution.

54:11.960 --> 54:12.960
Nice.

54:12.960 --> 54:15.080
Okay, that seems like a big deal.

54:15.080 --> 54:21.720
I was looking at the this week in solos number 40, and I saw you or Josh whoever wrote this,

54:21.720 --> 54:27.120
Josh, I saw a mention in here about so build with a great gift that got my attention, but

54:27.120 --> 54:28.840
it went over my head as to what it is.

54:28.840 --> 54:31.000
You're telling me, what are you telling me exactly?

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
What are you?

54:32.000 --> 54:33.080
What knowledge bomb are you dropping on me?

54:33.080 --> 54:35.160
Because all of a sudden, I just got really excited.

54:35.160 --> 54:41.020
Okay, so our old build system was Python, you know, we all make mistakes.

54:41.020 --> 54:45.520
There is an initiative in solos to move away from Python because we basically want compiler

54:45.520 --> 54:50.480
safety in all core tooling, which I think is a fair assertion to have.

54:50.480 --> 54:52.960
And Python has no performance at all.

54:52.960 --> 54:56.880
So we've rewritten in Go, Go is now the tooling language we use in solos.

54:56.880 --> 54:59.920
It's hip, it's sexy, and it gets the job done.

54:59.920 --> 55:04.300
So we've rewritten the whole thing in Go and basically reverted a lot of the design mistakes

55:04.300 --> 55:05.720
from the past.

55:05.720 --> 55:09.560
So now it basically you have this base image, if you think about it, kind of like in the

55:09.560 --> 55:13.520
terms of Docker, except that this has done this longer than Docker has.

55:13.520 --> 55:17.040
If you think about it, you've got a base image and each image is either unstable or the main

55:17.040 --> 55:18.040
repo.

55:18.040 --> 55:22.000
That insight has got a very minimal solar system, which is enough to have a compiler

55:22.000 --> 55:23.600
in there basically.

55:23.600 --> 55:27.240
So we store those in our server, you'd select the profile you want.

55:27.240 --> 55:31.160
When that downloads, it puts that as the bottom layer, and it gives you a temporary working

55:31.160 --> 55:32.800
root over the top of it.

55:32.800 --> 55:36.760
So the bottom layer is never touched, you have this temporary root, which is using overlay

55:36.760 --> 55:40.520
fs, then in a container, it's basically a container now.

55:40.520 --> 55:43.880
It used to be just a troop, but actually uses namespaces as well now.

55:43.880 --> 55:48.880
At the end of that environment, that will build the package entirely within the environment.

55:48.880 --> 55:52.680
Networking is disabled as well, so you can't exit the sandbox.

55:52.680 --> 55:56.600
You run as an unprivileged user inside the sandbox as well.

55:56.600 --> 56:00.800
And once the build is done, it'll admit the packages into your current directory and re-own

56:00.800 --> 56:02.240
them to your user.

56:02.240 --> 56:05.920
So if you invoked it as pseudo, it'll take the original pseudo user and make them owned

56:05.920 --> 56:06.920
as yours.

56:06.920 --> 56:08.040
Oh, that's a nice touch.

56:08.040 --> 56:12.480
If you run the index command, all of the packages you have in the current directory, it'll emit

56:12.480 --> 56:16.160
an EO package index file, which is a repository.

56:16.160 --> 56:20.640
The next step of that is creating a tool called binman, which is binary manager.

56:20.640 --> 56:24.740
I'm not good at naming things, by the way, I'm not sure if you've noticed.

56:24.740 --> 56:29.640
It's also a tooling goal to replace our repo management script, which again, is Python.

56:29.640 --> 56:35.880
So what kind of workload are they looking at, say, if I wanted to install, I don't know,

56:35.880 --> 56:39.160
is Telegram in the main binary repository?

56:39.160 --> 56:40.160
Yeah.

56:40.160 --> 56:41.160
Okay.

56:41.160 --> 56:42.920
So if I put an application like Telegram or something like that, what would be the, for

56:42.920 --> 56:45.720
the end user, what kind of process would that be for me to do that?

56:45.720 --> 56:46.720
Yeah.

56:46.720 --> 56:51.320
I mean, to build something like that, our package files are called package.yml.

56:51.320 --> 56:53.360
They're YAML syntax.

56:53.360 --> 56:58.200
So the very basic things our package have, you have a name, a source, a version, and

56:58.200 --> 56:59.760
a release.

56:59.760 --> 57:03.040
So you're describing the meta information of the package, and the source is where it

57:03.040 --> 57:04.040
comes from.

57:04.040 --> 57:07.080
So that can be a tarball, or it can be a Git source.

57:07.080 --> 57:11.520
We got built in Git supports into SoulBuild now, and it knows how to do tags, branches,

57:11.520 --> 57:15.440
commits, sub modules, and it'll handle all that stuff for you, and it'll create a systemwide

57:15.440 --> 57:19.040
cache that you can reuse for the builds to speed them up.

57:19.040 --> 57:23.420
And then you basically have three steps, which is set up, build, and install.

57:23.420 --> 57:26.680
Any one of those can be missing, it doesn't matter, but you're going to have to have some

57:26.680 --> 57:29.560
sort of process to say how to make a package.

57:29.560 --> 57:35.840
And they kind of map to the configure, make, install of a normal package you would do.

57:35.840 --> 57:40.320
But instead of that, they're basically bash scripts inside each one of those steps.

57:40.320 --> 57:42.400
So you wouldn't be lost.

57:42.400 --> 57:47.800
What we do is we spice it up by using macros, kind of like RPM, but better.

57:47.800 --> 57:51.240
So we'll have these predefined variables, like you'll have the configure, but with a

57:51.240 --> 57:56.360
percent sign, that will pass all of our configure tags to it, instead of just doing a dot slash

57:56.360 --> 57:57.360
configure.

57:57.360 --> 58:00.480
You can use some of the macros instead, and then boom, you have a package.

58:00.480 --> 58:04.760
You can make a package in like 11 or 12 lines.

58:04.760 --> 58:05.760
And then you can add...

58:05.760 --> 58:06.760
This is pretty neat.

58:06.760 --> 58:10.020
Well, what it does as well is it automatically split that package up for you.

58:10.020 --> 58:14.520
So if you package a library, and let's say it's got some header files, and it's got some

58:14.520 --> 58:19.400
package config files, you'll automatically gain a sub package called devel, and that

58:19.400 --> 58:22.320
will automatically depend on the main package as well.

58:22.320 --> 58:28.280
If you pass the emul32 option as yes, it will rebuild the 32-bit version of that library.

58:28.280 --> 58:32.320
So you get a 32-bit and a 32-bit devel sub package on top of that.

58:32.320 --> 58:35.760
So do you mean 32 and a 64?

58:35.760 --> 58:36.760
Yeah.

58:36.760 --> 58:43.520
So it has built-in emul32 support, so it'll build 64-bit and 32-bit at the same time.

58:43.520 --> 58:44.520
That is pretty nice.

58:44.520 --> 58:49.240
And not to diminish, that sounds like a really badass system, which has stuff in it that

58:49.240 --> 58:55.040
only stuff that's getting popular now, like overlay OS, or overlay FS, and YAML files.

58:55.040 --> 58:59.920
But honestly, my thought when you described all this is, it'd also just be nice if I could

58:59.920 --> 59:01.980
just install a snap package.

59:01.980 --> 59:02.980
That would be really nice too.

59:02.980 --> 59:10.500
You could, but I mean, snap packages require containment, and they require containment

59:10.500 --> 59:12.760
because of the fact you download them from the internet.

59:12.760 --> 59:17.680
Something is in our repositories, it is implicitly trusted, so it does not need container, right?

59:17.680 --> 59:21.920
So we ignore the container part of it because that's not relevant to our discussion.

59:21.920 --> 59:25.160
It's about the simplicity and distribution of a package.

59:25.160 --> 59:29.480
In terms of the simplicity and distribution of a package itself, why package and solbuild

59:29.480 --> 59:31.400
win every single day?

59:31.400 --> 59:34.520
Because we've got an advanced macro system, we've got advanced build system built into

59:34.520 --> 59:36.080
the different types.

59:36.080 --> 59:39.480
We support multi-lib out of the box and naturally.

59:39.480 --> 59:43.800
You can pass optimization straight away to the package by setting the optimize flag.

59:43.800 --> 59:49.840
We've got advanced macros, so in terms of the core of a package build, R1 is superior

59:49.840 --> 59:50.840
to snap.

59:50.840 --> 59:55.840
The only reason snap, quote, wins, end quote, anything, is because it's supposed to be distributed

59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.600
in an untrusted fashion and downloaded in an untrusted fashion, so it has the container

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.600
aspect.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.440
If you take away the container aspect, R1 is superior because it's meant for native packaging.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.640
The advantage though, still remaining to snap might be developer adoption and availability

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.360
of software for me as an end user.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:16.960
Sure, but the fact is, all of our software for building stuff, for doing the, what we're

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:21.560
calling basically the solus build machinery, obviously it's all saying open source, but

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.600
we're making it as agnostic as possible.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.280
The reason being is we're sharing that build machinery with anyone who wants to use it,

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.360
and at some point we will also share that with partners.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.360
So while they might not want to share their source code with us for us to build their

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.880
packages, if we share our build machinery with them and set them up, then they can build

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:42.680
them themselves without us even having to interfere and provide native packages.

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:47.640
And with the repository management tool we're now creating as well, that will automatically

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:52.880
maintain the repo, create the delta updates they need, automatically trim old update,

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.360
allow them to have unstable and stable branches.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.680
So with our tooling now going to them, they will be able to-

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.640
Can I just interject very quickly?

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.640
Yeah, sure.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:06.000
Ikey, some of what you've just described about snaps there, you're a little bit off, we'll

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.640
talk after and I'll fill you in.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.720
That's fine, it's fine, it's absolutely fine.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:15.000
And also there's some new stuff happening in snaps and I'll give you the inside skinny

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.440
because you might want to consider supporting some of the new snap features that are coming

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.440
along and I'll talk to you about it after.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.240
Do you want to talk, you don't want to talk about it on the show?

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.240
No.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.240
I want to know though.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.240
I'll just say this.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.240
Well stay tuned everyone.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:33.280
I'll say this regarding all the stuff that Ikey just described is, note it down now folks

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:38.960
because look at it coming to a Linux distribution near you in probably about five years.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.840
Maybe that should be, we're just talking about this cross distro work.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.920
Maybe this is one of the next things that should lead over.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.720
Yeah, the VHS versus Betamax thing, isn't it?

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:52.200
Mine is the superior technology in terms of building packages, right?

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:57.360
In terms of distribution, obviously snap wins because they have a center, they have everything,

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.240
but they're the common one that everyone wants and everyone is going to use.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.240
Well I'll give you this.

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:05.240
It's a good track record of being ahead of where the puck is going and so there's probably

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.240
a lot of stuff.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.920
We're not going to win on popularity at all there.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.240
Snap has already won.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.840
There is nowhere for us to win.

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:17.840
So I'm not, as much as I was originally completely opposed to snap, there comes a point where

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.680
you're going to have to say, this is what everyone's going to use.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.220
It's not going to be flat back.

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.220
Snap has already beaten them.

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.220
Snap is already the thing.

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:26.120
I was going to give you a whole flat pack pitch, but all right, okay.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.080
I was going to ask if you had a minute to talk about flat back, but that's fine.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.080
What about AMP?

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:35.680
Oh, and there's others that are just not coming to the old noggin right now.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:41.760
Anyway, I'll have a chat with Ike and give him some inside info later.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.760
I want to know.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.760
I like the inside info.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.760
That is always good.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:49.080
Yeah, I'll give you some good source Ike, no bother.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.960
Well if it's good, then I'll integrate it.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.960
Yeah, it sounds like it.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:53.960
It sounds like it.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:58.240
It's a position that is not impossible to be moved on, but it has to be worth it.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.840
Well, that's interesting, and now makes me pine for SolOS at the beginning of the show.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.040
Maybe next week we should both be running it.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:06.040
Ooh, ooh.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.920
All right, well, let's talk more about that on the post show.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.560
I want to just briefly, because we went on for a while because I was fascinated by that

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.220
last topic, and I think rightfully so.

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:19.480
So let's take a moment and let's thank Linux Academy for sponsoring these shenanigans.

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.280
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged is where you go to keep it going.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.440
If you'd enjoy the conversations, the discussions, and want to hear more of us, please visit

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:30.240
our sponsors, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, where you can sign up for a seven-day free

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:34.520
trial of the Linux Academy platform, where you can learn a heck of a lot more.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.960
In fact, they've just launched two new courses, I just got an email about it today, it's super

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.960
wicked.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.640
Check them out at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, it is the place to learn about Linux and all

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.920
of the big infrastructure that runs on top of it, with hands-on, scenario-based labs,

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:51.280
instructor mentoring, nice servers that spin up when you need them, that match the courseware

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.920
you've chosen, like DistroWise, you SSH into it to get your work, they've got practice

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.400
exams so you can prepare for certs, and they've got tiny little nuggets when you don't have

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.480
a lot of time, you just want to go into a single topic, as well as schedule the availability

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.000
picking depending on your busy, busy schedule, but probably the biggest feature is the instructor

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.240
mentoring, full-time human instructors.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:14.300
Also, by the way, I'll mention this, check out on their blog, Linux Academy is hiring

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:19.920
right now for instructor positions and for back-end positions, linuxacademy.com slash

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.800
unplugged is where you go to support this show and learn more about the Linux Academy

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.520
platform, they have new tools to help you promote the hard work you've done at Linux

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.880
Academy to an employer or a client or a school, and they have team accounts if you're a small

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:36.440
business or a big company or an enterprise that wants to have your staff learn up and

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.840
train up, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.840
the Unplugged program, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and go check out the new courseware

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.880
they launched today.

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.280
Now what do you think?

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:53.320
I was thinking about Ubuntu Core when I saw this, and I actually, it feels like a competitive

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.400
response to Ubuntu Core.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:01.280
Google is launching Android of Things, and they plan to juice it up by integrating it

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:07.480
in with all of their Google Play services, back-end cloud computing capabilities, Android

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:12.160
Studio and the Android SDK for development, and they're going to also partner with Intel

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:18.400
for the Edison, the NXP Pico, and the Raspberry guys for the Raspberry Pi 3 to get images,

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:25.480
as well as Belkin and Lifix and Honeywell and Wink and TP-Link and First Alert.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.520
So they're going to work with Google on Weave and integrations with Google Assistant.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:35.400
So the whole picture here is Android on the IoT device itself, Weave for the communications

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:39.880
protocol, and Google Assistant for the command and control.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.600
That's the world of Android Things.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.080
That's quite the ecosystem.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.080
Yeah.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:52.680
I wonder if this is Google, I know this sounds like it's maybe a little fanboy or something,

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:57.320
but I honestly would not be surprised if they tried Brillo and went, shit, that didn't work,

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:02.000
and these things that canonical this Ubuntu Core stuff over here, this looks like a good

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
idea.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
We're starting to see people experiment with this.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.200
Well, how could we jack that up?

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.200
How could we juice it up?

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.760
How do we make it Google-ified?

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.760
We've got the Play services.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.520
We've got the Google compute infrastructure that we could bring into the mix.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:18.000
We've got the Android SDK that's already massively deployed, and the Android Development Studio,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.680
which has a huge user base, and they come in with a lot of territory advantages.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:25.880
Yeah, a lot of things are going to be ported right over, already run there.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:30.360
Does it feel like a response to any particular product to you, or does it just feel like

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.200
them still searching for a market?

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.920
Yeah, it seems kind of like a natural evolution.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920
They want to be here.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.160
There's like the article talks about, there's a whole Apple HomeKit kind of stuff, and so

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:45.120
I could see where they'd want this, and I mean, Android's their platform, right?

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.400
And if they have another chance to push the Play Store, to push their reliance on the

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:54.120
Google-managed services, it seems like it's something they'd really be interested in doing.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:57.640
I don't know what they mean when they write this in here, but they say something to the

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:01.680
effect of being able to also Google... What do they say?

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.040
One intro... Here it is.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.480
I don't even know what this means.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.920
This is from TechCrunch.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:10.220
One interesting twist here is that Google will soon enable all the necessary infrastructure

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:15.840
to push Google's operating system updates and security fixes to these devices.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.400
What does that mean?

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:21.520
Does that mean that they've introduced a product as it stands right now that doesn't support

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.520
getting updates?

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.520
Is that what that means?

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.100
It kind of sounds like it, yeah.

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:27.400
Like the updates is a new thing.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.120
And you know what would be really great?

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.480
I mean, they're following the IoT tradition there, I think.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.800
Yeah, you know what would be super awesome?

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:38.060
If Google come out and just be really clear and plain spoken about what the update policy

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.680
is for these types of devices and what the agreements are in place with the OEMs to make

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:44.440
sure that you can update these devices.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:48.460
Is this more like Android Wear, where Google has a little more control?

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:51.820
Or is it like the Android we know and tolerate?

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:55.500
Even in Wear, where they promised that they would be able to update it directly, LG held

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:58.120
back my updates.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:03.040
And I have to wait for my Wahey watch or whatever it is to get updates from them.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.320
It's the same exact thing I have.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:11.080
And in fact, when I had the LG Watch R, they rolled out a new version of Android Wear that

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.960
enabled Wi-Fi support.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.400
But not for my model.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.920
It had a Wi-Fi chip in there, but they didn't have the right driver in the image.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.880
So my model didn't get Wi-Fi support.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:23.280
So the same fragmentation issues in Android handsets are in Android Wear today.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.760
So I have very little faith.

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:29.160
And what strikes me about this is one of the core principles of some of the competitors'

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.760
offerings, like Ubuntu Core, is transactional secure updates.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:33.760
It's like part baked in.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:34.760
It's like the core.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:35.960
It's the foundation of the product.

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:36.960
Am I wrong, Wimpy?

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:41.040
But isn't it sort of a foundational aspect of Canonical's IoT approach?

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.800
Sorry, you're going to have to repeat the question.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.000
I was distracted.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.600
Updates for Ubuntu Core, is that a transactional update?

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.400
And wasn't that one of the core aspects of creating a software platform for devices like

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.800
this is making sure you can reliably update them?

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:57.800
Yes, that's correct.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:03.040
And it appears, as of right now, the Android of Things IoT platform doesn't actually support

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.360
updating the software.

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.600
And that they're going to roll that out soon, they say.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.280
And it seems to me that that's a fundamental design aspect of an operating system like

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.280
this.

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.440
Not like something you bolt on, but something you start with, especially in this space.

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:21.280
So to build on your point, when we started this show, I was running Nextcloud 10.

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:26.240
I've updated the snap to Nextcloud 11.

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.960
And I found one of the Nextcloud apps that isn't compatible with Nextcloud 10.

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.760
And I could choose to roll back now if I wanted to, because that one app doesn't work.

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.880
And in addition to rolling back the app, I could also choose to roll back all the data

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.560
associated with Nextcloud as well.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:49.840
So you've got an and or option there.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.280
This is going to be an interesting thing.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:53.760
I'm sure Google will have some amount of success with this.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.480
And it's kind of interesting to see what their focus is.

01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.800
Obviously, at least here on this network, on this show, we talk a lot about IoT in terms

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.920
of security, in terms of security failings, in terms of how it makes Linux look, how maybe

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.480
it'll make Android look.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.640
So it'll be interesting to see what evolves as Google's focus here.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.800
Is it just ownership?

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.240
Is it just getting their services going?

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:18.680
Or is it doing things in a secure way that's better than what we have now?

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:23.560
There could be a legitimate competitive functionality to having the Google Compute Cloud behind

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:24.800
your IoT device.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.640
Obviously, these things are pretty low power, low CPU.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:31.760
So if you could do a huge computation job off on Google services and then send the result

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.280
to the device, that could be really, really competitive.

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.800
And something that would be harder for smaller players to match.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.400
Yeah, at least depending on the pricing.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:42.920
But Google seems to be willing to throw in some of this compute just as a, here you go,

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.320
here's some free compute.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.440
Go ahead, have at it.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.080
Anyways, we'll just watch it.

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:49.380
This is nothing today to really balk at.

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:55.680
But I do feel like the Ubuntu core solution is getting more and more traction.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:56.680
You look at the next cloud box.

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.560
But there's also a lot of other boxes out there that are running it behind the scenes.

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:03.840
And you look at something like this and you think, Google must have noticed.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.840
They must have noticed.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.080
That was my thought when I saw it.

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.860
And we'll have a link in the show notes if you want to read more about their efforts

01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:12.300
and maybe even how you could jump in.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:15.680
And I guess we say goodbye to Brillo, which still exists in some form.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.000
But it's not going to be the solution for us.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.160
This show will go on in another form next week.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.160
Join us, won't you?

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.640
Tuesdays over at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash live or just go right to jblive.tv and get

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:30.520
it converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:35.400
Also you can submit content or open source projects we should talk about, updates and

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.960
feedback at linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.000
Also if you want to watch my biggest Linux switch disaster of all time.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Oh, it's embarrassing.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000
It's bad.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.120
YouTube.com slash Chris Fisher.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.120
That's my personal channel.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:50.520
That was the last, the latest video I have posted over there, as well as about a dozen

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.520
other ones.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.520
Which you can check out.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:54.640
You can follow me on Twitter, at Chris Elias.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.640
You're at Westpain, aren't you?

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:56.640
That's a great Twitter handle.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.640
Oh, thank you, sir.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:58.640
That's nice.

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.120
You really nabbed a good one.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:04.760
At Jupiter signal for the network and we'll see you right back here next week.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:16.360
I've never installed Linux.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:39.680
Get it out of here.

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.560
Thank you, MumbleRoop.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.560
You guys are wonderful.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:50.560
Yeah.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.560
Love your faces.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:55.080
Thank you for being here and thank you for participating and a special thank you to Ike

01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:58.200
and Wimpy for doing a bunch of the heavy lifting this week.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:59.200
That was good discussion.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.200
No problemo.

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.200
Really liked that.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.320
Like you stood about.

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:04.400
Snap into a slim cloud.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:05.400
That's funny.

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.400
That is funny.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.400
What's that?

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.400
What's this?

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.040
Oh, what about, what about snap into a next cloud?

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:12.200
That's not bad either.

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.200
Snap install next cloud.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.200
Android of things.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.440
That's also not bad.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:19.880
I would have dropped that last topic if I could have got Wimpy to talk about it, whatever

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.880
it was on air.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.560
I would have dropped the Android topic like it was hot.

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:32.200
The only reason I'm reluctant is because I'm not sure if it's public information yet.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.200
It will be very soon.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:40.640
So when it all comes to pass, I'll explain it, but I'll explain to Ike because it's of

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:45.240
relevance to some of the points he was making earlier and he's a distro maintainer and we

01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:51.080
want distro maintainers to think thoughtfully about supporting snaps.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.080
Sure.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:53.080
I bet you do.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.080
That would be great.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:55.080
It's a super cool thing.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.080
Yeah.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.080
Yeah.

01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:58.080
And you know, I'll tell you more at some point in the future.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:04.600
I think, I think it's, it could be the great equalizer for distributions like Solus.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.600
If it got enough adoption.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.840
Look, I mean, you've got to look at it from my angle here, right?

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:13.040
From my perspective, I don't have the package of problems and people have tried to call

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.720
me out on this before and have failed.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:20.760
From my perspective, snap is something that came into existence to address the limitations

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:25.720
in the host operating systems that created them and nobody can deny that because every

01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:29.640
statement you see about snap, it was so hard to maintain the Debian package.

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:34.400
I created Y package and solbuild and all the tolens around solus so that I didn't have

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.400
that problem.

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:41.360
It's very hard for me to adopt something based purely on when it, it was developed on the

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.160
premise of a limitation that I don't have.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.640
So it really takes some serious convincing.

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:47.640
Yeah.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:53.080
But see, I look at it from the other end from a, there are certain, there are, I would,

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.920
I mean, if I knew today that all, anything I ever wanted to install would be a download

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:04.240
and a double click, I would switch because for me, that time savings, yeah, I know.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:07.600
But for me that time savings, because I am window shopping essentially, not for windows,

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.200
but I am, I'm window shopping software.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.200
I'm downloading three or four things and I'm trying them out.

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:18.960
And so yeah, I, for me, like the difference between like, like if I could grab a snap

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.920
of the new Lightworks beta with the new UI, I would be trying it out today.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:26.180
But because I have to wait for it to land in the different package managers, I'll try

01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:27.480
it out in a couple of weeks.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.080
You know, I'm not as motivated by that point.

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.080
The news is old.

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.080
It's just.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:36.640
If only I was going out for coffee with the product manager for Lightworks tomorrow morning.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:37.640
That was a thing.

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.640
Yeah.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.640
Yeah.

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:40.640
That would be amazing really.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.640
If you could give them a snap.

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.640
I know.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.640
I know.

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.640
If, if he was working in the same town as me, wouldn't that be incredible?

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.640
Yeah.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:46.640
That would be really handy.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.920
But I follow what you're saying too, Ike.

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:52.640
Like, I don't really think it's, it's too, there's not at a point where it's hurting

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.080
you not to, to have it.

01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.240
So it's, you have time for it.

01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:57.520
It would hurt me to have it though.

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:01.680
I mean, I kind of think we're trying to like, you know, shoot an ant with a bazooka here

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:06.600
because the problem you're talking about is one that definitely exists.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.840
There is a continuous integration problem with getting new software.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:15.640
There are some, if we use Windows terms here, there are some titles that we'd really like

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:16.740
to get access to.

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.500
We want the latest Kdenlive.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:23.960
We want the latest OpenShort, you know, well, maybe not OpenShort, but you know, there,

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:28.400
there are some things out there we really want right away, but the, the, the way that

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:33.440
we're going about it is a model from the early two thousands and late nineties, which was

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:36.440
double click this file and install it on your system.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:41.680
The world has moved on from then and people are used to using software centers.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.880
You look at Windows and you have the Windows store.

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.880
You go on Android, you have the Android store.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.180
You go on Mac OS, you have a store.

01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:51.960
So I disagree with the premise of double clicking and downloading from a site.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:57.200
I know it probably can be integrated into a store afterwards, but I'm having a hard

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.720
time being sold on this.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:16:59.720
Okay.

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:05.600
So we'll, we'll talk about this in more detail, but with regards to the store versus download

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:09.360
from a vendor website, snaps do both.

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:13.880
And there is a store implementation maintained by Canonical, but you can replace that with

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.600
your own store implementation.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:21.820
And there is a reference store on GitHub that you can use if you want to do your own backend.

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:25.240
So both, both paradigms are supported there.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:30.080
You're quite correct that one of the things that snaps addresses is the complexity of

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:33.680
creating Debian packages, absolutely.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:41.640
And I also agree because I've looked at the packaging format that you use, snaps and EOPKGs

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.100
are very similar in the way that they're constructed.

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.680
They're both YAML files.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:50.480
They contain a lot of the same stanzas, very similar, but there are some other benefits

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.200
and there's some other little things that are coming on stream and I'll have a chat

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:59.040
to you about that and see if I can convince you that it's might, maybe worth a second

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.840
consideration at some point for Solus.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:04.920
I mean, I'm not hating it on the sake for hating it because at the end of the day, it's

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.920
not just about me.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:10.640
It's about the Solus users and their access to software, but I've got to do it based on

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:13.240
technical merit and not the original.

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:14.240
I like that.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.240
I like that as well.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.240
I think it's refreshing.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:17.240
Yeah, it is.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.960
I also have to think about the maintainability of an upstream.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:24.040
Now, I don't like to say this and I really don't mean this is in any way disrespectful.

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.600
Canonical do have a history of dropping projects after a couple of years as a lack of interest.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:28.920
I'm not innocent myself.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:29.920
I've done the same.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:35.120
Now, I'm kind of concerned to see how Snap will play out and as to the longevity of it.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:39.960
I do think it's got more of a future than Flatpak because I think Flatpak went about

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:45.320
it the wrong way, bonding of runtimes and basically overriding the operating system

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.320
vendor.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.920
It feels like, don't you get the sense that Canonical's, I mean, they're pretty committed.

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:53.160
Out of all the things they've launched in years, this feels like one that company-wide,

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.160
they're sort of a line behind.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:55.160
Yeah.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:56.160
I mean, it does.

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.160
The signs are there.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:01.640
The signs are positive and I am starting to come around to it more, but I just need that

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.120
little something to push me over.

01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.120
That's fair, dude.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.120
Don't get me wrong.

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:08.840
I'm quite happy to admit when I'm wrong and when that does happen, I like to be wrong.

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:14.000
Imagine yourself at the edge of a cliff with a fluffy cushion beneath and there is me with

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.880
a tickling stick gently coaxing you to the edge of the cliff.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.880
Come on.

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:18.880
Come on.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:19.880
Are you fine?

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:25.880
Well, I mean, once I am pushed over and it's, at this point, it's become an inevitable.

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.360
I'm just doing the last childish resistance.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.360
Yeah.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.680
Well, you're still, I mean, it's natural.

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.680
It's natural.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:36.080
I like to think, I like to hear about the thought that goes in behind the distro, too.

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.080
That's nice.

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.720
And there's some good adversarial process going on.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.360
Yeah, but I mean, once it happens, I'm quite happy to stick it in the top or something.

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:47.920
I mean, I half an hour ago were, you know, singing the chorus from the same song sheet.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:54.320
And now, now you can see us slightly offset from one another, slightly grating, you know.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:20:02.440
So this this competitive disagreement can happen cordially and it and it's fine.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.440
Yeah.

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.440
Yeah.

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:09.160
I just I wish that some of the online press could maybe hear this discussion that Ike

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:14.440
and I are having now where we're agreeing to disagree to some extent, but we're prepared

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:17.400
to talk about it a bit more after the fact.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:26.720
And and also just stop saying that open source projects are fiercely competing with one another

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:34.240
at the expense of collaboration, because it's simply not true that there is so much collaboration

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:41.200
that silently goes on in the background between large organizations and small projects and

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.880
the commentators simply don't appreciate that it's happening.

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:50.160
So hopefully this evening or this afternoon or this morning, however you're listening

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:54.560
to this, we've pulled back the curtain on that a little, just a little bit and let you

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:59.320
know that actually, when you say these desktop environments are not working together and

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:04.560
are not pulling in the same direction, we really are, because the one thing we all want

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:15.400
is quality Linux desktops to emerge to build a user base and pull more users and gravity

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.400
to our projects.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:23.160
My sense is it'll have to be a sustained campaign of of continually highlighting in a way that

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:31.000
is genuine and also interesting, because I feel like that narrative comes from the need

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.200
to write a quippy register headline or something like that.

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:38.840
That's where some of that narrative comes from, is the way that the model of that business

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:42.800
is so click driven.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.720
We all need each other at the end of the day.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:49.600
As much as we might all compete with each other, we need each other to be doing well,

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:53.360
because then it keeps us on our best form, it forces us to look at ourselves, which sometimes

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.360
is very hard.

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:58.920
You don't want to look at yourself, but it forces us to, and we have to keep improving.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:02.000
Once we do that, whoever you're competing with, they've got to do the same thing as

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
well.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.480
Now, some people are going to look back on this conversation and in a couple of weeks,

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:10.560
someone would join on the Solus channel and said, I heard you, you was on Linux unplugged,

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:17.080
you was very angry, because people don't understand this.

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.080
We have to disagree.

01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.160
We can't agree on everything.

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:23.360
There are things we are going to agree on, but if we didn't disagree, then everyone gets

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:27.200
a sub-powered watered down product with a unified vision.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.400
We need those competing things.

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.400
We need those things.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.200
You need to create friction to create fire.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.200
That's what we're doing.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:37.280
This is going to sound very odd, but we all rub against each other in slightly the wrong

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.280
ways.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.260
When you create a fire, we need to move Linux forward.

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:42.680
We all think we're right.

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:47.640
We all think that our direct direction is the right one, but we're all building on common

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.640
technologies.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.640
That's the thing.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.280
That is really the core thing.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:57.080
That's why it is so funny that I think it's lazy, too.

01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:04.240
It's really easy to see a new application announced, or a new desktop environment announced,

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:08.640
or a new distribution announced, and it's super easy to go, oh, well, look at us just

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:11.720
spinning our wheels again, and not taking the time to go, well, what are they doing

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.760
that's new and actually interesting?

01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:19.080
Because a lot of times, okay, legitimately, a lot of times there are people that are just

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:23.480
sort of maybe they're rage forking, and that has contributed to this as well, but a lot

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:26.880
of times there's real actual good work happening, and it's not just about forks.

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:27.880
It's about sharing code.

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:28.880
It's about working together.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:32.440
It's about building on common technologies, and that's not the discussion.

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:37.080
The problem is that every time there is a fork, it's often portrayed as a rage fork

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:41.200
without necessarily understanding the motivations behind doing that.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:45.120
Amartey was perceived as that when that was forked from GNOME 2.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:52.960
Now it was forked out of frustration, but it was also forked to preserve a desktop paradigm

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:58.280
that was well thought out and well tested, and I would like to see that desktop paradigm

01:23:58.280 --> 01:23:59.280
preserved.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:00.280
Yeah.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:09.000
Ike also talked about when we see other desktops doing things and it drives us forward.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:16.780
When I saw Daniel in the summer and he showed me what at that time was an alpha or a beta

01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:24.080
of elementary and the work they'd done on high DPI, I realized just how far behind Amartey

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:33.880
was in respect to high DPI because they really stepped on considerably, considering that

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:39.840
they were based on a desktop environment that didn't have all of the high DPI stuff at the

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.640
outset and they've had to implement it, and Amartey's coming from the same position, unlike

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:52.040
Ike who started in a position of having a lot of that stuff in place in the first place.

01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:59.400
So I realized that in order to keep up with elementary, high DPI is a top priority for

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.400
the Amartey desktop.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.400
Oh yeah.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.400
Preach it.

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:09.600
I'm quite happy to acknowledge that elementary's got the superior solution there and so is

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:16.960
Budgie right now, but we'll catch up and we'll catch up because I can learn and we can learn

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:20.040
from Budgie and Pantheon.

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:21.040
Yeah.

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.040
I love it.

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:23.040
Well Budgie cheated.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:29.680
One last confession to actually add there, speaking of Budgie, speaking of desktop and

01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:35.600
speaking of Brisk, so one recommendation I would like to make to any budding developer

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:40.520
who's listening to us now, I would say that I'm quite an experienced software engineer

01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:41.520
by now.

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:44.360
I've been doing this for a while.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:48.400
When I started Budgie there was a lot of things I could get away with because I was making

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.840
it for Solus and all of that, every single one of those decisions has come back to bite

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:57.600
me on the arse in the most horrific and splendid of ways.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:58.600
That's a very honest review.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:01.040
I bet it is.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:06.320
With the Brisk menu I started out knowing almost immediately that this is going to be

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.120
something that not just Solus is going to be using this.

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:15.560
I can't get away with gotten cornered here and as a result I'm doing it properly and

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:21.520
I had to go digging through the source code of GTK for some very, very badly documented

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:27.400
functions they claim to get and instead do and send and then return.

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:31.800
So it forced me to rethink how I was doing things and to truly investigate and that's

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:36.040
how Budgie benefited because I actually went and did it properly because I knew it would

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:39.780
have to be something that would stand up, not just on Solus where I can get away with

01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:42.760
including it, but everywhere.

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:48.160
So if you start with that mindset then everybody benefits and you create better software.

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:55.640
And the other way that Solus and Budgie will benefit from this is that Ubuntu Mate are

01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:05.280
embarking on a multi-month funding of this development work and that money iKey can use

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:11.280
to invest into whatever initiatives are important to the Solus project.

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.280
Which is money...

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:17.280
Alt-Tab, Alt-Tab, please fix it.

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:24.520
Oh, I don't remember which machine I have set aside, but I do think I have a machine

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:25.960
I could put Solus on.

01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:27.960
I think something happened to the Apollo though.

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:32.360
I don't remember what, but both my XPS and my Apollo are not currently booting.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.360
That is some bad luck.

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:34.360
What did you do to it?

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:35.360
I think the Apollo...

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.360
It's not that Fedora you were installing, wasn't it?

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.120
Yeah, I think the Apollo was the Fedora 25 install that broke.

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.200
I think that's just a software thing, but I can't remember.

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.600
And then the XPS, I think my little m.drive died on me, which just drives me crazy because

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.240
that's like the second one I've lost now.

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.240
But the XPS...

01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.040
You're making notes as to what manufacturers are behind these drives.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.040
Yeah, you're right.

01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:57.600
But we need notes for a rant later.

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:02.540
I'm a little disappointed though, because I feel like the XPS 13 with that infinity

01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:06.240
display would just make such a beautiful computer to run Solus on.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.240
I would really like...

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:10.560
I'm just so sick of dealing with broken drives.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:12.560
Yeah, it's so frustrating.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.560
With what?

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:15.320
What are you sick with dealing with?

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:18.320
I just have machines...

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:23.240
Not only did I have the m.die in the XPS, and now for whatever reason the Apollo isn't booting,

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:27.240
but also my OG, my first Bonobo, won't turn on now.

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:28.240
And it just dies.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.800
Even if I remove the battery.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:32.920
So I've actually had three laptops die on me recently.

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:33.920
That's tragic.

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:34.920
Man.

01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:37.200
Yeah, I know.

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:43.840
So if you've got dying laptops, what sort of laptop is there a gap for in your laptop

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.320
requirements right now?

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.320
The range.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:51.520
The only laptop I have that I can reload right now, ironically, is the Librem.

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.520
That's the one machine...

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:53.520
Hey!

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.520
It's finally coming in useful.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.520
Took a while.

01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.520
So that's my...

01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:04.680
And then I have the MacBook running Arch, which has now become my daily driver now though.

01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:08.080
Which is not ideal, because the battery life is really horrendous on that thing.

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.560
And the other thing about the MacBook Pro that's really frustrating is just browsing

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:15.020
the web causes the fans to go on that thing.

01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:16.840
And under Mac OS, it's silent.

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:20.320
And then so under Linux, having the fans run all the time, but it still feels warm to the

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.320
touch.

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.320
Like it just, it's all off.

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:23.320
It's all off.

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:24.320
Slowly melting.

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:25.320
Yeah, it feels like it.

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:26.320
Like I'm slowly killing my MacBook.

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.960
So yeah.

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.840
But it's a quad core with a terabyte SSD.

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.040
And a beautiful screen.

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.040
Yeah.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.440
So it's kind of my go to, like, I'm going to be doing some work and I want a 15 inch

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.440
screen.

01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.440
Right.

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:39.440
And you can plug in.

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.600
Describe the laptop that you want right now.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:42.600
It ranges.

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:43.600
I mean, it really does.

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:44.600
It depends on the job.

01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:47.320
I think there's a spot for something like the XPS.

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:52.880
But I was kind of, after talking to you about the XPS 15, I was also kind of thinking about

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:55.160
maybe making that the next Linux box.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:56.160
I don't know.

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.160
I'm all over the place, really.

01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:02.180
Because I could, I could make use out of a really high end machine doing OBS and shenanigans

01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:03.180
like that.

01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:07.440
Or I could make use out of a little low end machine doing show prep and web browsing.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.440
So it's sort of.

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.800
And what about something to test distros on?

01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:13.640
Have you got a machine to do that or is that a machine that you need?

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:14.640
That's the Librem right now.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.200
And the downside to that, and it's nice because I can, I can test Intel drivers, but like

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:22.800
with Fedora and often there's like a little, there's little issues with the NVIDIA driver

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:23.800
that I just don't know.

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:28.040
I currently don't have a machine to test on because that was my Bonobo, but now the Bonobo

01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:29.040
don't boot.

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.040
Bonobo don't boot.

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:32.040
Yeah.

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.040
Yeah.

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.040
But I was able to play around with Wayland.

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:35.040
So it sort of worked out.

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:36.040
Yeah.

01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:38.880
It's hard because you kind of need a diverse, a diverse set of chipsets.

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:39.880
Yeah.

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:40.880
Yeah.

01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.880
Kind of need a lot because I.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:42.880
Yeah, exactly.

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:45.520
I don't usually have anything in the very high end performance range right now, but

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:46.520
most.

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:47.520
You don't have any AMD.

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:50.360
No, but most things in the mid range are usually powerful enough these days.

01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:52.240
I'm all over the place wimpy.

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.240
You know, you can't nail me down.

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.240
I know.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.240
Yeah.

01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:56.240
It's a, this is a tricky conversation.

01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:57.240
Yeah.

01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:00.680
Well, cause basically there's a spot in the lineup for all types of hardware.

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:04.240
Because if you think about it in terms of review, both are, I like to, I would like

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.360
to review on the high end of hardware and on the low end.

01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:09.760
So yeah.

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:12.720
For my daily use myself, I like something as powerful as possible.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:15.760
I would say the Apollo probably falls a little short as a two core.

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.280
You want four?

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:18.280
Yeah.

01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:19.760
But then I also don't want it to be.

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:20.760
Well, you want battery life.

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:21.760
Yeah.

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:22.760
And you don't want it to be loud.

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:23.760
Yeah.

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:24.760
Yeah.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:25.760
I'm all over the place.

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:33.600
I've, I still use my Apollo as my lightweight, you know, go, go, go out and use computer.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:39.880
But when I need to travel and I need a workhorse to do work on, but I don't want something

01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:44.520
heavy, I've got a fully full tilt, um, XPS 13.

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:45.520
Oh 13.

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:46.520
Hmm.

01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:47.520
Hmm.

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:48.520
Yeah.

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.520
Cause that's, that's small enough and light enough that I can stick it in my backpack.

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:51.520
Oh, for sure.

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:55.440
And pack my pants and socks and my toothbrush and toothpaste and all the rest of it.

01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:56.440
Yep.

01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:57.440
Yep.

01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.440
Yep.

01:31:58.440 --> 01:32:01.920
Um, but if I want to, you know, just, um, go down to the, uh, the pub on a Saturday

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:07.920
afternoon and do some work, then, uh, I take the Apollo because that's got a larger, a

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.400
larger battery screen.

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:13.520
And it's lighter weight and uh, yeah, the battery actually lasts longer because the

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:18.560
XPS 13 is a UHD display, so it burns through the battery a bit faster.

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:21.760
So yeah, so you know, it's, it's difficult.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:28.920
So I, I found that I need about five laptops, uh, find all of the niches that I need.

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:29.920
Yeah.

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.760
That's kind of what I hate to say, but like if I'm doing reviews and sometimes I'm doing

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:36.040
really high end production stuff and sometimes I'm just browsing the web, reading emails

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.400
and there's a different machine.

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:43.880
So my, my sort of test machine is the XPS 15 because it's got both Intel embedded and

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.280
Nvidia discrete graphics.

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:46.280
Yeah.

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.280
Yeah.

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:50.680
So you get to test both on that and it's got a 4k screen and all the rest.

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:54.160
That's why I was kind of looking at, you can do more than 16 gigs of Ram too, right?

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:55.160
You can do up to like 32.

01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:56.160
I've got 32 in mine.

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:57.160
Yeah.

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.160
That's, that's awesome.

01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:59.480
That's hitting the sweet spot for me.

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:01.960
And how is it thinness and heavy and weight wise?

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.440
Uh, it's great.

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.440
I've got it, I've got it just on the floor here.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:09.280
It's yeah, it's, it's, um, it's not, it's not heavy.

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:14.680
It's about the same, uh, thickness, slightly thicker than the XPS 13 only slightly.

01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:15.680
Yeah.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:19.280
It's got the same keyboard as the XPS 13, exactly the same.

01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:22.960
Uh, it's just got a wider, you know, um, palm rest area.

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:23.960
Is the trackpad bigger?

01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:24.960
Is the trackpad?

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:25.960
It's the same.

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:26.960
No, it's, uh, that's a good question.

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:30.760
I haven't measured it, but it's, it's big and no it's much, but actually it's much bigger

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:31.760
thinking about it.

01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:32.760
Yeah.

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:33.760
It's much bigger.

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.760
Yeah.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:38.600
And you know, the other nice thing about that is I'm pretty sure Dell still accepts Bitcoin.

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:40.160
So that's very appealing.

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:41.160
Yeah.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.480
I bought mine with Bitcoin.

01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.720
Wimpy, are you playing it all with LibreVault or what's, uh, what's your latest experiments

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:47.720
in syncing?

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:48.880
Not, not recently.

01:33:48.880 --> 01:33:53.620
So I was using it, oh, I don't know, some months ago, three, four months ago, uh, did

01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:58.400
a little test, but what I was using it for, I've switched to a different tool so I don't

01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.400
have it right now.

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.400
Uh, have I heard of the tool?

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.400
Sorry?

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.400
Have I heard of the tool you switched to?

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.920
Um, probably not.

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:09.280
It's called, it's called Yadim, Y-A-D-M.

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:10.280
I haven't, I haven't either.

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:16.120
It's yet another dot manager, uh, so it's a dot file manager and this is what I use to

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.820
manage my whole roaming profile thing now.

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:21.560
And Wes, you want this in your life.

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:22.560
It's amazing.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:24.640
That does sound amazing.

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:29.200
I feel like we had, that might've been, we had a dot file manager on our picks runner

01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.480
up list for last recently and I don't think we put it in the show.

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:36.800
So it works like Git, instead of, instead of typing Git, you type Yadim, um, and then

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:40.040
all of the Git, you know, commands follow as, as you would expect.

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.040
I see.

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:42.040
So it kind of just wraps it.

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:43.040
Yeah.

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:45.240
Uh, but you can, it's got crypting in there as well.

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:50.480
So for example, anything sensitive that you want in your dot files, you can encrypt those

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:55.840
as when you store them in the Git repository, uh, and then decrypt them when you pull them

01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.840
out.

01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:57.840
This is the dream.

01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:03.720
All of my, um, my VPN keys and things are in my dot file Git repository, but all of

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:05.440
that stuff's encrypted.

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:07.120
So what are you not syncing the config of?

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:09.720
Is there any application that's caused too much trouble or it's not worth it?

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:11.560
Is there anything you just don't sync?

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:17.720
No, pretty much everything that I rely on is synced either the dot file that it uses

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:26.200
directly or I export certain, uh, G setting branches for applications and then have a

01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:27.200
script.

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:33.000
So in my Yadim dot files, I also have a scripts directory and one of those is to restore those,

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:39.200
um, decomp dumps so that, um, when I check out that I can run a script and everything

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:58.200
just comes back.
