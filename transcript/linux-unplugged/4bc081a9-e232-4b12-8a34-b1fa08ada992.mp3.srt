1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
So, what it's based on, I've got two things that might upset you, Chris, and then something

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,540
that might not upset you.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:17,020
So here's two things, and I don't know any of this, but just consider this, I think Purism

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:23,500
have raised somewhere between $950,000 and a million dollars, right?

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,620
That was what their crowd funder achieved.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,380
I'm going to go see if I can Google it while you talk, I'll see if that sounds about right.

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:35,760
And their laptops were kind of expensive, somewhere in the $1,500 to $2,000 a pop.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,140
Yeah, so for the $1,500 they raised about $589,000, and then they raised a separate

9
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,460
amount for the $1,300, right?

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,680
So yeah, almost, wow, that's a lot of money.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,680
It's a lot of money.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,660
But also, how is one person going to assemble 475,000 laptops and ship them in a timely

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,660
fashion?

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,720
Well, he's not going to, he has a manufacturing partner.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,940
No, no, he doesn't, does he, heck?

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,940
You think?

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,860
I know this ODM, I know how it works.

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,940
They send him a load of parts and he has to put them together, or somebody has to put

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,940
them together.

20
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,940
So there's that to consider.

21
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,660
You know, even if he just ships you the parts, that could be a whole show, you'd assemble

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,660
the Purism.

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,660
At this point, I would take it.

24
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,740
If he would just ship me the parts at this point, I will assemble it.

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,580
So here's the other thing, and again, I know nothing, but consider this.

26
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,460
The laptop in question is a model from nearly two years ago.

27
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,940
Yeah, right, it's a fifth gen i7.

28
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,460
Which generation are we on now, six or seven?

29
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,220
Seven.

30
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,180
Does the ODM still make those parts?

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,620
Oh, I didn't even think of that.

32
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,540
No, well, that only occurred to me earlier this evening.

33
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,420
Anyway, those are the two downers for you.

34
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,420
Yeah, those are big ones.

35
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
Yeah, you're welcome.

36
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,420
You're welcome.

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,940
On the plus side, there's a nice photo of one in IRC, if you want to click on it.

38
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,460
You know, what is that?

39
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,980
Is that a Librem or what is that?

40
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,980
Yeah, it is.

41
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,940
Yeah, it was a result of someone asking a question on the forum.

42
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,100
Hey, has anyone got their Librem yet?

43
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,580
And some guy replied on the forum.

44
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,300
Yeah, here's a photo.

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,700
And it was a blank post.

46
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,540
And I thought, ha, you're a funny troll.

47
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,480
But actually, no, it was just the forum didn't work.

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,900
The link didn't appear.

49
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,180
And he pasted it afterwards.

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,100
And that is his Librem.

51
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
Is that his?

52
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,620
Well, it also looks like it's right next to another computer box, which looks like it's

53
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,580
next to an office desk.

54
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,580
This is what I think.

55
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,700
I think that might not be from an owner.

56
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,700
Yeah.

57
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,940
Oh, hush now.

58
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,100
Maybe they just have two computers in the box right next to each other.

59
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.

60
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:47,980
They got two.

61
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,980
They got two, right?

62
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,980
Yeah, that's what happened.

63
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,980
Yeah, maybe that's why I haven't got mine.

64
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:51,980
What's...

65
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,980
Big orders first, Chris.

66
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,860
You see, there's a box behind it there that looks like a computer box.

67
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,940
And then you look below it, it looks like another box down there, too.

68
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:07,060
Those are two, and the other 474,997 are off in the distance.

69
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,060
I'll tell you where my spider sense first started tingling was when they launched the

70
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,500
13 before they even finished committing on the 15.

71
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,060
And I thought, that's weird.

72
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,620
And then there was the Rev 1, Rev 2 stuff.

73
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,500
And that felt a little weird, and getting automatically upgraded to Rev 2.

74
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
And I didn't quite...

75
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
I didn't...

76
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,200
I was like, I just want my computer, you know.

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,380
And now here I am in the beginning of 2016, and I'm kind of in a really tight spot.

78
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,660
We should do a look back where you talk over your earlier review when you were excited

79
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,660
about the purism.

80
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,660
I wonder if I could find that.

81
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,660
You can yell it past Chris.

82
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,660
Can anybody...

83
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,420
Would anybody mind, maybe in the chat room or somebody out there, could go find a time

84
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,380
code on YouTube of when I talk about it?

85
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,860
I would like to really see that.

86
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,860
That'd be interesting.

87
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,620
I thought you were very hopeful.

88
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,620
Would you...

89
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,180
Would you like a little bit of good news?

90
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,180
I would.

91
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,180
Very much so.

92
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,180
Okay.

93
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,180
Okay.

94
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,180
Here we go.

95
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,180
Right.

96
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,180
Let's just post this here, Chris.

97
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,620
So all of this jesting I've been doing with you, somebody's been listening, and I think

98
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,980
you might know this.

99
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,980
I think Rotten has been talking to you.

100
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:18,460
So Entroware, who are based in the UK, have heard me winding you up.

101
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:25,940
And I heard that yesterday they received the parts that they've assembled for their first

102
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,940
US prototype.

103
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,940
Really?

104
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,940
Ho, ho, ho.

105
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:40,300
And they're going to be sending you the Entroware Apollo with the Intel Core i7-6500U, which

106
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:47,860
is the new Skylake CPU, with a fully packed system.

107
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,140
So this is a full Ultrabook.

108
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,140
Wow.

109
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,740
So the Apollo here is...

110
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,740
This is the 13-inch one, right?

111
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,740
Yeah, 13.3.

112
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,740
This is the Ultrabook.

113
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,740
Yeah, yeah.

114
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,740
Nice.

115
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:10,140
So they're going to send the i7 with eight gigs of RAM, spinning hard drive for home,

116
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,980
and a solid state drive.

117
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,780
Two drives.

118
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,940
Nice.

119
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,140
It comes with the Intel graphics.

120
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,740
It's a full HD screen, and they're going to be putting this operating system called Ubuntu

121
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,740
Mate on it.

122
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
Never heard of it.

123
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,740
Perfect.

124
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,220
Oh, that's so exciting.

125
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,300
But what's different here is obviously Entroware have been focused on the UK.

126
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,460
And so what they've done here is they've actually...

127
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,820
This is like an experiment for them.

128
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,940
So they're putting together their first US spec laptop.

129
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,260
So this has got a custom chassis, and it's got the US keyboard, and it's got US power

130
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,260
and all the rest of it, which is the first time they've done this.

131
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,460
And when it's gone through their QA process, because they put it through a sort of a build

132
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,900
and burn exercise, they'll be shipping that to you for you to have.

133
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
That is going to be...

134
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,900
I can't wait.

135
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,460
I'm definitely going to be talking about that when I get it.

136
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,460
That'll be really cool.

137
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,460
Oh, wow.

138
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,300
No, and wouldn't it be ironic if the other one showed up around then?

139
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,580
No, wouldn't it be good because in effect...

140
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:24,900
So this Apollo, so this is the Apollo 2000, I have their previous model, which is the

141
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,200
Apollo 1000, which is the same platform as the Librem 13.

142
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,500
And this Apollo 2000 is the next generation device.

143
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,540
So there's a whole load of feature uplift.

144
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,940
So it's got backlit keyboard, and it's got Bluetooth 4 and the touchpads.

145
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,700
This is going to be an epic machine to run.

146
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,900
This is going to be a great 1604 machine when it comes out too.

147
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,140
This is going to be great for that.

148
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,140
Yep.

149
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,180
Plus, I haven't even tried running Linux on a Skylake machine yet.

150
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,180
I haven't either.

151
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,380
I want to test it out.

152
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,380
I've got one.

153
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,380
Yeah.

154
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,380
Runs good.

155
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,380
Huh.

156
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,380
So that's exciting news.

157
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,380
I can't wait to see it.

158
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,740
And of course, you guys will hear more about it when I get it and I put it through its

159
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,740
paces.

160
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,100
Oh, that'll be exciting.

161
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,660
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 131 for February 9th, 2016.

162
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:30,300
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that barely survived weaponized

163
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,820
Panda Express.

164
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,820
My name is Chris.

165
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,820
My name is Wes.

166
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,820
Hey there, Wes.

167
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Guess what?

168
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,820
I'm all back.

169
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,820
I'm a member of the human race.

170
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,060
I'm glad you're feeling better.

171
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,620
You know, it's almost worth the troll of Noah to get so sick.

172
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,580
I thought about bringing some over on my way.

173
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,460
That would have been mean, but yet hilarious.

174
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,900
Short version, Chris got really sick.

175
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,220
That's when calling myself Chris now.

176
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,220
Yep.

177
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,220
Got really sick after eating Panda Express and the Linux action show this Sunday.

178
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,420
I am now back 100%, I believe.

179
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,460
Maybe 110%.

180
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,980
Maybe for a great show of Linux Unplugged coming up in this episode of 131.

181
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,060
Something to compete with Unity and maybe Unreal's engine.

182
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,700
Something to bring Linux games to the masses, connected to the cloud, and integrated with

183
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,700
Twitch.

184
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,780
Amazon's got a new project to make cross-gaming platforming easy, like all the scores, stat

185
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,460
stuff, and to publish the game on Linux.

186
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,340
They got a whole new thing they just announced today.

187
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,860
We'll talk about that.

188
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,140
Also some interesting work happening in Wayland to make it maybe a little more competitive

189
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,360
with X in one unique way.

190
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,920
Also we'll talk about something you should be using on your Linux box if you haven't

191
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,340
tried it already.

192
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,500
A group that promises to compete with Ubuntu's convergence.

193
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
That's right.

194
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,680
The folks over at Koror have something new for you to check out.

195
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,660
We'll talk about that new Ubuntu tablet also getting full GPU acceleration, or at least

196
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,420
as close to it as you can, in your VM coming from the Linux kernel.

197
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,980
And last but not least, Streamio?

198
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,620
What the heck is it?

199
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,940
And how long is it actually going to be around?

200
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,300
Grab it for your Linux box while you still can.

201
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,500
We'll be talking about that in today's episode of Linux Unplugged as well.

202
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,420
We got a lot of stuff to cover, so let's bring in that virtual lug.

203
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,060
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

204
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,060
Hello.

205
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,060
Hello.

206
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,060
What's up, guys?

207
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,060
You guys can't see it, but I did salute you.

208
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,700
I saluted the Mumble Room, didn't I?

209
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,700
Yes, you did.

210
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
I did.

211
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
We both did.

212
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
I did.

213
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,940
So good morning and good afternoon and good evening, everybody.

214
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,980
Time appropriate greetings.

215
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,500
Let's talk about Lumberyard.

216
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Lumberyard plus Amazon GameLift plus Twitch is games for Amazon Web Services.

217
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,740
It is Unity meets Amazon.

218
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,340
You're probably familiar with Unity, the game engine.

219
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
Yes.

220
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,340
A game engine and development environment designed for professional developers, a blend

221
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,120
of new and proven technologies from CryEngine, Double Helix, and AWS.

222
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,140
They're really pushing the AWS aspect of this.

223
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,140
Yes, they are.

224
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,140
Yeah.

225
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,960
Lumberyard simplifies and streamlines game development.

226
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,500
As a game engine, it supports development of cloud-connected and standalone 3D games

227
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,440
with support for asset management, character creation, AI, physics, audio, and more.

228
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,020
On the development side, Lumberyard IDE allows you to design indoor and outdoor environments

229
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,180
starting from a blank canvas.

230
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,380
Now I don't know if they're actually going to make the IDE available for Linux, but …

231
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,580
Oh, that will be a good question.

232
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,140
The Twitch integration is interesting.

233
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,260
The GameLift integration is interesting and obviously the AWS integration.

234
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,260
Guess what?

235
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,260
Interesting.

236
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:29,140
What I think is actually the sort of important bullet point in this announcement is Linux

237
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,060
support is a planned feature.

238
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,540
It's part of their deal.

239
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,540
I don't know.

240
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,540
I don't have much more to say to that.

241
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
It announced today.

242
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,540
Do you have any thoughts on it?

243
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,660
I think it's a little … It's interesting.

244
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,240
One thing people should note is in their FAQ, can my game use an alternate web service instead

245
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,240
of AWS?

246
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Oh, yeah.

247
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,240
No.

248
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,620
If your game servers use a non-AWS alternate web service, we obviously don't make any

249
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,140
money and it's more difficult for us to support future development.

250
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,140
Oh, no.

251
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,580
But you can use your own servers.

252
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,580
Yes.

253
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,060
You can use hardware you own and operate for your game.

254
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
You have to be careful.

255
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,940
There are some large license agreements as with all game things, but otherwise it's

256
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,940
interesting.

257
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
Yeah.

258
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,900
Also the aspect of what kind of free is it came up.

259
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,140
It's not free as in free software.

260
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,760
It's free as in the cost.

261
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
It is proprietary.

262
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,980
The source code is only made available in such that you can use it to work on your game,

263
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,380
not in such that you can use it to improve, extend, and contribute.

264
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,220
So nothing radical kind of in line with other engines that we've seen.

265
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,220
But it's interesting.

266
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,220
Yeah.

267
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,940
Andy, you had something you wanted to add regarding the license from Unreal.

268
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,940
Go ahead.

269
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,940
Right.

270
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,260
Because Unreal's license actually allows you to contribute.

271
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,380
That's why the Linux editor exists and is stable.

272
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,380
I wouldn't say supported.

273
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,780
They don't admit to that, but it's stable and there's enough community support that

274
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,300
it might as well be supported.

275
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,300
Yeah.

276
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,100
Obviously, I think Unreal is sort of the one that anybody that's making a serious game

277
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,260
is going to look at.

278
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,940
They have a very interesting way to do that.

279
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:57,700
I think it's free, and then if you make some money, you're going to have to give us a cut.

280
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,260
But when I say it's free, again, I'm talking free as in cost.

281
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Right.

282
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,260
You get to use it.

283
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
You get to see the code.

284
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,020
At the same time, it is a serious like, this is no joke.

285
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,060
You could make an honestly great game with this.

286
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
No bar.

287
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,940
And it obviously took a lot of development time to create that.

288
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,940
Sorry.

289
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,340
Somebody in the moment room was adding something.

290
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,340
Go ahead.

291
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
No.

292
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,340
And you can contribute back.

293
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,340
That's a big deal.

294
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,340
Yeah.

295
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,340
Good point.

296
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,340
Thank you for bringing that up.

297
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,340
Yeah, that is a good point.

298
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,340
All right.

299
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,100
So moving real quick through a couple of things that broke since Linux Action Show.

300
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,980
Wes, if there was one feature of X11 that I wish Wayland had, I mean, I think Wayland's

301
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:34,980
great.

302
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,580
I'm excited to try Mir.

303
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,580
Right.

304
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:43,380
I'm not like an X11 fanboy, but there is one thing that I legitimately love about X that

305
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,060
Wayland doesn't do that I am kind of worried about.

306
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,060
Network transparency.

307
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,060
You got it, buddy.

308
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Yeah.

309
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,740
The whole X11 over network is so great.

310
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,660
I mean, if you're just doing SSH, X11 forwarding, or if you're doing something like FreeNX remote

311
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,900
desktop, there is entire systems that are set up around X11.

312
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
That's how they work.

313
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,900
That is.

314
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,900
Yeah.

315
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Even internally.

316
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,460
And so this is something I'm like, I'm really going to miss this.

317
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,420
This is really nice with Wayland because there's nothing really for this built into Wayland

318
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,420
until now.

319
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,020
Well, we'll see.

320
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,300
This is Wayland over the wire.

321
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,420
Obviously, if we intend to make Wayland a replacement for X, we need to duplicate this

322
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,420
functionality.

323
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,380
However, some Wayland design decisions make it difficult to implement this kind of network

324
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,380
transparency.

325
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,820
I didn't really know what these were in the past.

326
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,860
I knew they existed, but I didn't really know.

327
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,860
They hadn't been codified.

328
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,100
They hadn't been laid out easily.

329
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
Yeah.

330
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,860
So I guess file descriptor parsing is used exclusively in the protocol.

331
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,660
For example, key maps are passed from the compositor to the client as file descriptors.

332
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,100
The client is supposed to nmap those file descriptors.

333
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,860
It's a really complicated way of saying there are certain things like key maps that are

334
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,860
done locally.

335
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,140
Keyboard repeat is another example of that, is handled on the client side.

336
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,780
So if you have a dodgy network connection, the key press packet arrives, but the key

337
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,460
release packet is delayed, the client would start repeating keys and it's also sluggish.

338
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,180
Buffers are shared between the client and the compositor somehow.

339
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:11,780
They could be shared memory through mmap or dmfboof, or it could be a MESA buffer or MESA

340
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,780
buffer extension.

341
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,820
In any event, image data is never published to the compositor through a network socket.

342
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,060
It always takes the form of some kind of handle and the client and the server or the compositor

343
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,700
in this case understand.

344
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,660
These handles are local only and meaningless over the network completely.

345
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,620
They don't have any kind of way to track them over the network.

346
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:37,220
So they have a really fairly simplistic implementation now of Wayland over network transparency and

347
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,200
the way they've solved this, and they're calling it Wayland over the wire, which essentially

348
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,380
splits the Wayland protocol over TCP IP sockets.

349
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,300
Since Wayland only carries handles to image data in its messages, I've added some new

350
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,500
messages to take care of this.

351
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,820
So a couple of things have been added.

352
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,260
I've also taught libwayland client about buffers, which is probably a controversial move.

353
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,220
I've done this by adding client-side hooks to certain requests.

354
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,060
So it does take some changes and improvements, as I'm calling them, but I mean obviously

355
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,300
it's technically thick stuff to understand.

356
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,380
But essentially what he's doing here is he's adding the necessary hooks to add data to

357
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,180
make this stuff go over the network so that when something receives it on the other end,

358
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,220
it knows what the hell it's receiving.

359
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,980
I'm not entirely optimistic because it requires changes.

360
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,980
Matthew Feeney Yes.

361
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,380
And some of those changes even by the author's admittance are controversial, right?

362
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,380
But it's interesting.

363
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,860
It's like first steps, right?

364
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,340
So like hopefully this could be the building block and we can have like a better framework.

365
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:37,180
Jason Kuznicki I don't realistically see Wayland working

366
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:42,620
in a lot of corporate environments without this kind of – I mean any time I've remotely

367
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,700
administered a server, eventually in that contract or in that job I've gotten some

368
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:53,900
crappy app or something that I have to run a GUI for or I'm setting something up and

369
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,120
it only accepts local host connections and sometimes it's just easier to install Firefox

370
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,860
and run Firefox through X1140 or something.

371
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,220
Like it is always – I've always had a situation administering a server where eventually

372
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,300
it was like, OK, maybe I need X for this and then I install X and I do X1140.

373
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,860
That's come up or sometimes it's for convenience too.

374
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,940
So not having that in Wayland, I guess what I would see is people would stick around with

375
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,660
X that need that.

376
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,540
Like it would keep people on X longer than necessary if you don't have these features.

377
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,220
Matthew Feeney That's like the last thing they need to

378
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,220
be Wayland compliant.

379
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,900
Jason Kuznicki I find this to be completely fascinating

380
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,980
and I don't actually have a lot of optimism.

381
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,860
But there is already a proof of concept and a request for comments out.

382
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,860
So that's better.

383
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,500
Of course it requires a bunch of changes.

384
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,220
Anybody in the Mamba room have any thoughts on network – like remote network desktop

385
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,340
for Wayland or MIR?

386
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,980
Is there any information about MIR supporting this?

387
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,380
I thought so.

388
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,260
Matthew Feeney It's interesting that it's coming from Samsung.

389
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,260
Jason Kuznicki Oh yeah.

390
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,380
Thank you for mentioning that.

391
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,380
I did mean to bring that up.

392
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,380
Yeah, that's a great point.

393
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,380
Matthew Feeney That's the small open source group part.

394
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,380
Jason Kuznicki Yeah.

395
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,240
Samsung are the – this is coming from the Samsung open source group.

396
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,420
So yeah, that's a great point.

397
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,780
Matthew Feeney I have a question.

398
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,100
Jason Kuznicki Okay, question first.

399
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Go.

400
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,020
Matthew Feeney Why not just use something like RDP?

401
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,860
Jason Kuznicki And what would it – it would start a Wayland

402
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:21,860
session on the remote server and then do like an image capture type return or how would

403
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,860
that work exactly?

404
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,020
Matthew Feeney Well, I know that RDP is like a standard for

405
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,660
remote desktop operatives that I see.

406
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,660
Jason Kuznicki I don't really understand.

407
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,540
I don't understand how that could apply to anything but Microsoft.

408
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,420
And I know it – I think there is a way to implement it.

409
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,860
Matthew Feeney But the thing is, doesn't RDP integrated

410
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,180
the GDI drawing layer?

411
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,340
So how can you possibly use that on Linux?

412
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,340
I don't understand.

413
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,540
I thought RDP specifically worked at the GDI level which meant that one of the nice things

414
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,700
was instead of actually drawing images, you're actually getting GDI instructions through

415
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,380
RDP and that's one of the reasons why it's faster.

416
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,300
Jason Kuznicki Well, so yes, you're absolutely right.

417
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,300
It does.

418
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,860
Free RDP does this and they're currently doing it through X and I believe they also

419
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,380
have it working under Wayland now and that's been their big push as to like, yeah, you

420
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,380
can do this.

421
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,380
You currently have something that's working.

422
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,380
But it's not –

423
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,380
Matthew Feeney How can that be?

424
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,380
Jason Kuznicki To be honest, I don't know.

425
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,380
Matthew Feeney You're right.

426
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,380
I'm looking at it right now.

427
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,220
There's a Western implementation of RDP access – oh, okay.

428
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,220
This is something.

429
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,220
Huh.

430
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,220
Jason Kuznicki I think it's one of those things that –

431
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,140
Josh Byerly It's one of the really good way of like drawing

432
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,780
OpenGL and DirectX over RDP.

433
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,940
Matthew Feeney Fascinating.

434
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,980
So free RDP, I've got to look more into this because I know I've heard it mentioned

435
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
a few times.

436
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,980
Free RDP is a free implementation of the remote desktop protocol released – I didn't

437
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,260
know Microsoft released it under the Apache license.

438
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,660
When the hell did that happen?

439
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,460
Enjoy the freedom of using your software whenever you want the way – that is incredible.

440
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,460
All right.

441
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,740
Well, this is a thing I've got to look into because remote desktop sucks for me right

442
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,740
now.

443
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,540
I've been using – I'm back to using Splashtop again which is just –

444
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,540
Jason Kuznicki Oh.

445
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,540
Matthew Feeney Mm-hmm.

446
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,540
I tried TeamViewer for a while.

447
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,540
I'm having problems.

448
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,500
Josh Byerly I don't think free RDP is Microsoft.

449
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Matthew Feeney No, no, it's not.

450
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
They say it's based on the RDP –

451
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Josh Byerly Right.

452
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,460
Matthew Feeney – protocol that's been released under the Apache license.

453
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,380
Jason Kuznicki Yeah, I have a few coworkers that use this

454
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,380
thing.

455
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,380
Josh Byerly Right.

456
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,380
Microsoft doesn't expect so.

457
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,380
Matthew Feeney They use it into Windows machines.

458
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,380
So it works well for that.

459
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,380
Jason Kuznicki Basically, they throw in a bunch of docs

460
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,380
and say, there, go and make your own.

461
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,380
Matthew Feeney I'm actually –

462
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,380
Josh Byerly By the way, we're not doing that thing

463
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,620
that we said we should be doing.

464
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,780
Jason Kuznicki Here's the funny, I just looked this up.

465
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:31,660
I previously tagged this page for me to look into in February of 2015, literally a year

466
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
ago.

467
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
Damn it.

468
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,660
Damn it, Chris.

469
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,380
You got to get to this stuff sometimes.

470
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,380
Literally a year ago, I tagged that to follow up on.

471
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,380
Son of a gun.

472
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,380
Matthew Feeney It's been a busy year.

473
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,380
Jason Kuznicki Yeah, yeah.

474
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,260
That's what's funny about me though is like I knew about it apparently, I guess I forgot

475
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,260
about it for a little bit.

476
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,260
I just don't understand how it works.

477
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,060
So I guess I didn't follow it.

478
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:54,340
But glad to see that they're looking at Wayland over the wire.

479
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,380
I'm drinking 7-Up today to help with my stomach.

480
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
Matthew Feeney Yes, recovery.

481
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,260
Jason Kuznicki You hear the sizzle?

482
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,260
This is good.

483
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,260
This is theater of the mind.

484
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,260
Here we go.

485
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,260
Isn't that...

486
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,260
Matthew Feeney That's great.

487
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,460
Jason Kuznicki You know exactly what I'm doing there.

488
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,460
Isn't that weird?

489
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,460
That's great.

490
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,740
That helps with the tummy I got since I was sick.

491
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,740
All right.

492
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,620
I want to talk about something that gets sent into the question all the way with this 7-Up

493
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,620
of yours.

494
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,620
Matthew Feeney Very optimistic, North Ranger.

495
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,020
Jason Kuznicki Is that Chris's tea?

496
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
Everybody gets on my case.

497
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,780
I'm like, I never drink soda ever, and then the one or two times I mention it on air,

498
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,360
you're going to get diabetes.

499
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,180
Your teeth are going to fall out of your mouth.

500
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,180
There's no room for Chris.

501
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,740
There's no room for Chris to be a human.

502
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,740
All right.

503
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,240
So one of the questions I get all the time for people who watch the live stream is, what

504
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,560
the hell are you using for your shell?

505
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,660
And I'll tell you why.

506
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,460
So one of the things I often do on the live stream before every Linux action show, as

507
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,900
any professional broadcaster who's been doing this for like almost 11 years, I completely

508
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,940
update my rolling distribution right before I go on air.

509
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,940
Matthew Feeney Obviously.

510
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,940
Maybe you should update it right now.

511
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,940
Jason Kuznicki I think I will, Wes.

512
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,940
Matthew Feeney Do it.

513
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,940
Jason Kuznicki Let me show you how I do that.

514
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,940
Matthew Feeney Roll the dice.

515
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,100
Jason Kuznicki So I'm using here, you can see I got myself

516
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,060
a nice terminal, and I'll start typing in my command packer, and I'm going to type in

517
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:15,340
da tic s y u, and did you notice in sort of a lighter gray there, dash dash no confirm

518
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
came up?

519
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,340
Matthew Feeney Yes, I do.

520
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,520
Jason Kuznicki And if I hit the over arrow, it'll automatically

521
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,780
fill that in for me, because that's a frequent, when I update my system, I frequently don't

522
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,700
ask it to confirm me, just go, right, because what could go wrong?

523
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:36,540
And so phish is a shell replacement for bash that I have been using for a couple of years,

524
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,080
I've talked about it a few times, although I still get questions about it all the time,

525
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,580
and it is something that auto completes and makes using the command line very simple.

526
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,580
Are you laughing?

527
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,580
Are you laughing at me about phish?

528
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,220
Look at that, the mumbrum's laughing at me.

529
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,220
They just love phish.

530
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,940
Matthew Feeney Complete agreement with phish.

531
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,460
Jason Kuznicki Yeah, phish is, and I want to make a big

532
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,780
recommendation for phish, but something's been happening lately with phish that I think

533
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,980
is taking it to the next level.

534
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,740
What about the fishery and the phish marketplace?

535
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,740
Now what do we have here?

536
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:13,380
We have ourselves the fisherman, a blazing fast plugin manager for phish.

537
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,580
You download it, you get these plugins, and then you combine that, the fisherman, with

538
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,580
the fishery.

539
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,580
Are you following me?

540
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,580
Is this making sense?

541
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,760
You combine the fisherman, which is a plugin manager, with the fishery, which is a plugin

542
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,200
market for phish.

543
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,340
Phish is the bash replacement for your shell that makes using the shell super easy and

544
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,060
auto completes commands you frequently use and things like that.

545
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,780
And so some of them are just really weird plugins, but some of them are very, very useful.

546
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,300
Wes, I don't know, have you had a chance to look at this at all?

547
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,260
Yeah, I've only installed a few, but man, they're right.

548
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,780
Fisherman is very fast.

549
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,660
And I mean, one thing about phish, right, is that it's a break.

550
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,660
It's not POSIX compliant.

551
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,740
It's a little different.

552
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,700
A lot of your bashisms aren't going to work.

553
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,740
Yes, and that does every now and then bite you.

554
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Yes, it does.

555
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,260
Sometimes, you know, sometimes there's something I've used before and I'm like, well, I'll

556
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,300
just open a bash shell and I'll run it there and I'll be done and I'll go back to phish

557
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,300
right.

558
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,300
That's exactly what I do.

559
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,680
But you get so much for free without touching the config file.

560
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,700
You get all the history completion.

561
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,500
You get, I mean, the functions are, if you want to write rather than an alias, you just

562
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,660
write a function in phish.

563
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,660
And it's really easy.

564
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,660
They're simple.

565
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,660
I don't know.

566
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,660
It's easy.

567
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,900
So, Fisherman, if I grok it, because I haven't installed it yet.

568
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
Oh, you haven't tried it yet?

569
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,900
No, no.

570
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,580
It was one of those things that crossed my radar and I was like, okay, I got to try this

571
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,580
out.

572
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,120
But if I understand it correctly, it's a way for you to go pull in some of these plug-ins

573
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,300
right into phish, right?

574
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,300
Exactly.

575
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,420
It's a little helper tool.

576
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,580
And so, what's the discovery like when you're on the command line?

577
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,500
Can you do a search or?

578
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,460
And then once you find it, you get the name and it's just like installing a package?

579
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,460
Exactly.

580
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,460
That is super cool.

581
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,700
You can also look on the GitHub.

582
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,580
So they have a...

583
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,900
It's free.

584
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:52,940
This plug-in, so this plug-in system is taking your shell and giving it like extended features

585
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,540
that you can sort of just...

586
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,300
Like a browser has extensions or something else.

587
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
I mean, this is...

588
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,420
Yeah, like the same model, you know, so many other applications already use.

589
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,760
Could be horrible.

590
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,940
And there is tons of use cases where you wouldn't need something like that.

591
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
Yep.

592
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,340
And as always, there's lots of places where it's like, well, you're on a million different

593
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,340
machines, right?

594
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,420
You can install Phish on all of them.

595
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,380
So for some people, there's no use case.

596
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,420
But if you maintain a small set of your own servers and you want something that really

597
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,300
you can mold to yourself or it's already just easy to deploy and it works great.

598
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,300
Yeah.

599
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,240
So check out the Fisherman and the Fishery.

600
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,800
And then one of the most common questions I get is, what shell are you using?

601
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,200
And I think it's because people see me typing on the live stream before the show and they

602
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,700
see me like it complete...

603
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:40,620
I love it because when I am on the live stream and I want to, a lot of times, like for example,

604
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,900
Noah will mention a package, like variety, which is the background manager.

605
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,100
And while he's talking about it, I'm like, well, that sounds pretty cool.

606
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,180
I want to go install that.

607
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:53,880
And the thing is, is I literally want to install it while I'm hosting a show, which is ridiculous.

608
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,420
And it means that you have like three seconds to get the job done before you're going to

609
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,940
be asked a question or I have to switch a camera or, you know, something like that.

610
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,940
So like the...

611
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,940
It's a tight timeline.

612
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
Yeah, it's tight.

613
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,500
But the fish there, I type in PA and packer-s is completed.

614
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
I hit over arrow.

615
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Then I type the package name and then it's, do you want to do no, no confirm?

616
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
I'm like, dash, dash, no confirm.

617
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Yeah, I want to do that.

618
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500
Over arrow.

619
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Boom, I'm done.

620
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
I'm like, yeah, I got the package installed.

621
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,320
And it learns based on the directory you're in as well, which is great.

622
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,420
That is really slick and something that it took me a long time to even realize because

623
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,220
I do different things like in my downloads directory than I do, say, my bin directory.

624
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,580
And I love that aspect of it.

625
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:36,500
It's just, it's like, it's, it is the best kind of technology assist where it's not,

626
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,380
it doesn't auto-complete in the way like Google search does where sometimes Google sends me

627
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,660
off on the completely wrong search because of the last second it suggests something and

628
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,660
then I search for the wrong thing.

629
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,660
The thing you were about to click is gone.

630
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,660
Yes.

631
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
That drives me crazy, right?

632
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,300
Fish never does that because it never automatically inserts the, it just puts it there in a, in

633
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
a slight...

634
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
Quiet little suggestion.

635
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Yeah.

636
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
Like a grayed out suggestion.

637
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
Just like, hey bro, you might want to try this.

638
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,300
You want to save some time?

639
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
I've been doing that a lot.

640
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,300
Yeah.

641
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
I love it.

642
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
Yeah.

643
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,300
There you go.

644
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Fisherman and the fishery will have links to both of those.

645
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,840
Fisherman is the plugin manager and fishery...

646
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,780
Is this all, are there only, is there only a few pages worth of plugins right now?

647
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,780
Yes, I believe so.

648
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,780
Yeah.

649
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,780
All right.

650
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,780
Well, people got to give them...

651
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,780
What?

652
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,780
What, Wimpy?

653
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,780
Uh-oh.

654
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,780
There's quite a lot.

655
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,780
Oh, okay.

656
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
All right.

657
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,780
There's, there's a couple of dozen.

658
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,780
Oh yeah.

659
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
Oh yeah.

660
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,780
Okay.

661
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,780
Are you using this?

662
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,780
Wimpy, are you using this?

663
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,860
Whilst you were talking, I did what you do on a show, which is I installed, just installed

664
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,860
it right now.

665
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,860
And what are your first impressions?

666
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,940
Well, there's lots of cool stuff in here.

667
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,940
Yeah.

668
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
I'm going to start using.

669
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Yeah.

670
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,940
I like like this.

671
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:41,660
Like the get aware stuff is going to be super useful at work and open a new terminal in

672
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,900
a tab, you know, from within the shell.

673
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
That is really nice.

674
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Yes.

675
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,900
Okay.

676
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
That one, that one right there just got me.

677
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,900
That.

678
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,900
Wow.

679
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,900
That did, that did not see that one before.

680
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,900
That's really nice.

681
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,900
Hmm.

682
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,900
So there you go.

683
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,100
I think, I mean, Wes points out, I've even had a couple of, I can't remember.

684
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,300
I think I've had some package installations break.

685
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,060
Maybe they were running a script or something like that when I used fish and I had to, but

686
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,580
you know, you just run bash.

687
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,580
Yep.

688
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,900
And more people are like, more things have support.

689
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,260
Like I know like if you use Python, you use like virtual environments, they have a fish

690
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,140
specific script that compensates for the bash one that you normally use.

691
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,140
Something to watch out for though.

692
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,140
Yes.

693
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,140
Yeah.

694
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
All right.

695
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,380
Mumbo, any other thoughts on fish or the plugins before we move right along?

696
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,380
Okay, good.

697
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,220
Because I think we're all going to have something to say about this next topic.

698
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,500
Who found this?

699
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
Was it Rekai that found this?

700
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
I believe so.

701
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,460
I don't know how this totally missed my radar.

702
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,340
This is like, this is like, this is my beat.

703
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,340
This is my beat.

704
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,860
And Rekai, you know, it's that damn beard of his.

705
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,780
He just catches interesting news bits inside of it.

706
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,780
Maru.

707
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,780
Maru.

708
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,300
Unleash your phone.

709
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,440
Unleash your phone.

710
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,020
The beta is now available on the Nexus 5.

711
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,660
Maru pitches itself as a new kind of computing experience.

712
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,380
It gives you a single context-aware device that makes personal computing really simple.

713
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,380
And guess what?

714
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,340
That device is your smartphone.

715
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:11,180
That's right, ladies and gentlemen, Maru based on Debian promises to bring us full convergence.

716
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,340
Something we've heard a lot of recently.

717
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,600
And so we have some reactions.

718
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,940
We've done some reading up about this.

719
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,940
We're going to tell you about that.

720
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,700
First, I'm going to tell you about our friends at DigitalOcean.

721
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,920
Go to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and it gives you a $10 credit

722
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,920
and supports the show.

723
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,500
It lets them know you appreciate them supporting us, letting us stay on the air, maybe doing

724
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,060
another couple of episodes for you.

725
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,220
Use that promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

726
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,140
One word lowercase.

727
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,740
DigitalOcean.

728
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,020
My Linux infrastructure on demand.

729
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,700
When I was testing Rocket Chat and Mattermost, it was a no-brainer.

730
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,980
It was a no-brainer to go set up on DigitalOcean.

731
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,740
First of all, the pricing is really straightforward.

732
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,500
The rig I got is six cents an hour.

733
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,820
And if I decide to keep it, then it's just going to be like 40 bucks a month for an unbelievable

734
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,820
machine.

735
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,740
But the pricing is – it starts at $5 a month.

736
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:03,100
At $5 a month, you can get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20-gigabyte SSD, a blazing fast CPU,

737
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,100
and a terabyte of transfer.

738
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,900
And they've got data center locations everywhere.

739
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,380
I mean New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Germany, Toronto.

740
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,380
Nice data centers.

741
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,380
Super fast rigs.

742
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,380
40-gigabyte e-connections.

743
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,820
I really love it.

744
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,260
They have the best interface in the biz.

745
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,700
It makes it very intuitive, so simple.

746
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,940
It really is sort of mind-blowing.

747
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,480
I talked about this recently, but one of the things I used was the Ubuntu 14.04 Docker

748
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,660
NGINX ready-to-go image.

749
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:36,580
Just makes it really quick to try something like Rocket Chat and deploy that in no time.

750
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:43,540
I mean, on DigitalOcean, I could set up a Mattermost – when I was talking about Mattermost,

751
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,460
one of the things I was talking about was the big thing for me with Mattermost versus

752
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:53,820
Slack or Rocket Chat versus Slack is it takes me 30 seconds to go set up a Slack team account

753
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,700
and then invite people to Slack.

754
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,180
Just roll it.

755
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,100
And when you go roll your own solution, which is obviously the better solution because then

756
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:06,500
you have complete ownership over it, complete control of your data and the direction of

757
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,500
it and all that stuff.

758
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,700
Like there are so many reasons why you'd want to self-host.

759
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,220
But the time barrier when you're really busy going from 30 seconds to a couple of

760
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,220
hours is just –

761
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,220
That's huge.

762
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,220
It's huge.

763
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,460
It's enough to make you go with Slack.

764
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,980
On this setup with DigitalOcean, Rocket Chat, you go deploy the Ubuntu 14.04 image with

765
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,220
Docker and NGINX and then you don't even need NGINX really.

766
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,980
You go deploy with Docker and then you go do Docker run and you do the Rocket Chat image

767
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,060
and literally 30 seconds after you have this rig set up on DigitalOcean, which takes you

768
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:42,100
less than 55 seconds, you've got Rocket Chat, a complete Slack replacement.

769
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:48,740
And the reason I think that's a good point to make is I've gotten about a dozen emails,

770
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,380
I've gotten a couple of tweets since Sunday's Linux action show from people who went with

771
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:59,620
Rocket Chat and decided to host it on DigitalOcean and they were on the cusp of going with Slack,

772
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,620
just on the cusp.

773
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,700
And then when they watched – I mean like the timing of our show was killer for these

774
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,700
people and they were blown away how quick it is.

775
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,760
Now Mattermost is the one I'm kind of leaning towards but they all went with Rocket Chat

776
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,660
simply because they all went and deployed on DigitalOcean droplets like that.

777
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,660
Done.

778
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,740
Well, hopefully they'll report back and we can kind of have a retrospective look at

779
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,740
it.

780
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,740
Yeah, seriously.

781
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,140
So this is really something to consider, is when you take down the barrier of entry of

782
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,900
getting a Linux rig that's really set up, ready to go, that just uses upstream stuff,

783
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,620
it's not like some custom setup that's using some weird control panel, it's just

784
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:37,580
vanilla Linux really fast and incredibly well priced, you've got to check it out.

785
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:43,420
You can go deploy anything from OwnCloud and Minecraft or Mumble, SyncThing, BitTorrent

786
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
Sync.

787
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
I love it.

788
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,420
And now things like Rocket Chat and Mattermost too.

789
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,820
Or you can go build an entire backend stack for something you're building, from production

790
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,820
to testing too.

791
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,820
Yep.

792
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,020
I just installed FreeSwitch on a DigitalOcean droplet.

793
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,020
Really?

794
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,980
And one of the great things with the DO, right, it's not behind a firewall, there's no NAT,

795
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,640
you have your own IP, it's public.

796
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,540
So like with VoIP solutions, that's a big thing.

797
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,740
Man, that is one of the reasons I'll go use DigitalOcean over setting up here in my house

798
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
is that I don't have to worry.

799
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,420
You don't have to log into a router or a switch or anything.

800
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,140
And the nice thing is with snapshots and backups and all that kind of stuff, I know I'm protected

801
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,140
if something goes weird.

802
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,020
And the other nice thing is it makes it really easy for other people to test on it too.

803
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,540
You just hand them the IP and there they go.

804
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:25,860
DO unplugged, get a $10 credit and try out DigitalOcean for a couple of months for free.

805
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,620
Some Linux infrastructure on demand, tell you what, or they got free BSD too.

806
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,580
But don't let anybody know that.

807
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,580
That's a big secret.

808
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,580
That's all secret.

809
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,480
Okay, has anybody in the Mumble room heard of Meru?

810
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,180
This just sort of caught me out of nowhere.

811
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,780
Rekai was the one that turned me on to it.

812
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,780
Okay.

813
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,780
Who said yes?

814
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,780
Yes.

815
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
It was me, Wizard.

816
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
Okay, Wizard.

817
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
Tell me, Wimpy, you've heard of it too?

818
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,780
Okay.

819
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:47,780
Apparently, I'm just out of the loop.

820
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,780
All right.

821
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,260
Is anybody comfortable enough to talk about it a little bit about their understanding

822
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
of Meru?

823
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,260
Has anybody ran it?

824
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,300
Well, I don't know if that's even a thing yet.

825
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:02,980
But Ww, I'd be curious to hear maybe your first reactions to it since you had a little

826
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,980
familiarity with it.

827
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,980
You mean Wizard?

828
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,460
Oh, Wizard, yeah, thanks.

829
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,860
So I just kind of looked into it.

830
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:17,980
It's kind of out of the same vein of what they were aiming for with, it was Deb.

831
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,100
There was a project a while back that got just a plain Debian install running on your

832
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,720
phone.

833
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,940
And it was kind of out of the same vein, but they're kind of digging a little bit deeper

834
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,620
than the previous ones now to the point where you can actually boot and not really so much

835
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:38,420
to boot, but get something running on another screen out of this same phone that you have

836
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
running.

837
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:44,500
So you could have, kind of in the vein that the original Ubuntu Touch had where it's like

838
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:49,140
you have your phone running Android right beside it just fine.

839
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,460
And on your monitor beside you, you have the Meru desktop running beautifully.

840
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,900
You can be using both at the same time, no stopping, no changing.

841
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,340
So they have a shared storage space between the two environments, and they go on to say

842
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:07,100
your phone does run independently of your desktop, so you can take calls.

843
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,860
It's almost like magic.

844
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,860
Based on Debian.

845
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:17,180
I'm getting, it smells a lot like, it smells like a lot what Canonical's been working on

846
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,580
for a while.

847
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,900
Only these are, they're saying they're focusing right now on the Nexus 5.

848
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:27,500
You connect it to an HDMI screen, Meru automatically detects when an external display is available

849
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,380
and then spins up your desktop, it'll boot in less than five seconds.

850
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,060
So what desktop is it running here on the Debian base?

851
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,060
You know, I'm looking at that.

852
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,420
It's got a dock, and it's got...

853
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,260
Workplace switcher up at the top right there.

854
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,500
Yeah, does it look like XFCE with a dock to you?

855
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
It does to me.

856
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
It does kind of, yeah.

857
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,500
It looks like a modernized looking XFCE with a transparent panel up top.

858
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,940
Or a fallback mode or something, I don't know.

859
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,940
Obviously the, everybody's got, I wonder what Poby thinks about this.

860
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,900
Poby, what do you think about a project like this?

861
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,740
This some level of validation that we're doing the right thing if other people are doing

862
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,660
the same thing as well.

863
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,820
Is there, I don't know how to put this, where does it sound, but is there like a, is there

864
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,540
a little bit of like, when you think about this, when you personally think about this,

865
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:21,220
do you think to yourself, if we really nail this, then there's going to be a dozen open

866
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,700
source copies within the first nine months of this thing.

867
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,380
Like if we actually nail this thing and the market really likes it and the response is

868
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,820
good, there's going to be so many clones of this thing in no time.

869
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,940
Is that a concern of yours?

870
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,140
So a clone of which thing?

871
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,140
A clone of...

872
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:47,620
I mean people could just take the work you've done and fork it or rebrand it and build on

873
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,780
top of it.

874
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,780
Here we have somebody who's...

875
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
They already do that.

876
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,780
There's already flavors of Ubuntu.

877
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:59,020
We already have people who've taken the work we've done and built something upon that.

878
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,220
So that's not unusual.

879
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,220
Okay.

880
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,180
So you feel like if somebody came...

881
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,020
I guess to me, I would want a little bit of a market advantage for a while.

882
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,020
I would want to have like sort of a position of leadership if I had done the years of R&D

883
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,860
and investment in that.

884
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,860
I do kind of...

885
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,860
Go ahead.

886
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,140
I feel that the leadership comes from the fact that they started it.

887
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,500
If you're looking for a product and you want the quality and you want to be assured that

888
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,940
you have something that's going to be supported, you look at, hey, Canonical is an established

889
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,860
company versus whoever else.

890
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:37,280
It is super-duper rewarding to be a thought leader in a concept, but it is also not necessarily

891
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,140
going to make you any money.

892
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,180
And that at the end of the day is what they've got to do, is they've got to make money.

893
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,180
But you're going to make money.

894
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,860
You're Canonical at the end of the day.

895
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,260
Everyone that wants support and wants a company that's going to be around for the next five

896
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,300
years will be Canonical versus whoever just started now.

897
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,580
I do think that's a good point.

898
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:58,420
Canonical will have better support than any of the open source copies, probably.

899
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,900
So they will probably have better answers.

900
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,980
I'm interested to know what their future plans are.

901
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,020
I mean, they've clearly chosen one device.

902
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:11,540
So you'll notice that they very explicitly say it only supports the Nexus 5, and that

903
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:18,080
mirrors what we did four years ago with Ubuntu for Android, where we very specifically only

904
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:27,780
supported one device until we got a deal with a third party to deliver this on their devices,

905
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,320
which we didn't do, which is one of the reasons why Ubuntu for Android doesn't exist now is

906
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,780
because we didn't get that buy-in from a third party to make this a commercial product.

907
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:44,700
What are your thoughts on, say, their strategy of let's just pretend for the sake of conversation

908
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,840
that they're going to support the 5X, and then they'll continue to support the Nexus

909
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,840
lines of phones?

910
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,340
What if as a project they just said, we're going to support the Nexus line?

911
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,860
That seems like a decent bet, right?

912
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,860
Right.

913
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:03,040
And that would be super if they have the resources to maintain that.

914
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,260
And every time that Google come out with an update for Android, they have to do their

915
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:12,260
patches or whatever it is they do to make their stuff continue to work.

916
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:18,140
Because what you don't want is to install this Maru and then three months down the line

917
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,700
there's some security update in Android that you really need to take, which is an over-the-air

918
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,700
update.

919
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,700
But then breaks your Maru install.

920
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,700
Right.

921
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,700
Right.

922
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
You don't want that.

923
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,740
So they need to have the resources to be able to cope with the upstream demands from Google,

924
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,900
which is somewhat out of their control.

925
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,300
I guess I want to sort of double down on that point just for a second, because I think we

926
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:47,660
are sometimes a little – I don't know exactly.

927
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,460
We think about things in terms of the PC market and we don't really think about things in

928
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:56,580
terms of the smartphone market when we think about getting software on smartphones like

929
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,620
Maru here.

930
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:06,060
The software – the cellular market now and the smartphone market itself in particular

931
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,460
is so much more than the actual product that you're making.

932
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,940
It's so much more about the patent licenses that you can strike, the content deals like

933
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:20,880
with Nokia here or with Amazon streaming or whoever that can provide you things like GPS

934
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,180
and assisted GPS or can provide you – like Apple's built Siri around Nuance, right?

935
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:31,220
Apple doesn't actually control the technology behind Siri that does the voice recognition.

936
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:37,260
That's Dragon naturally speaking from Nuance on the server that does Siri's voice recognition.

937
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,860
You have to have the sort of ability and the respectability.

938
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,860
You have to be a company.

939
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,900
You have to be respectable.

940
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,460
You have to be established.

941
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,940
You have to be somebody that's willing –

942
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,940
You've got to have the money.

943
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,860
And the people you've got to make these deals with have to be willing to make the deals

944
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,860
with you.

945
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,860
Yep.

946
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,220
And so you can't just be a couple of people online, a group of people that got a great

947
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,220
idea.

948
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:02,500
You've actually got to be a company that can be legally accountable for things and create

949
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,780
these deals and move these things.

950
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:11,500
That's what makes a cell phone and a smartphone compelling is all of this stuff behind it.

951
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,620
The iPhone wouldn't have been successful if there were no iTunes.

952
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:19,820
You take away iTunes – when the iPhone first shipped, there was no App Store.

953
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,820
There was just iTunes.

954
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,900
You take away the App Store and you take away iTunes and the iPhone has nothing, right?

955
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,660
It would have gone nowhere.

956
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:33,900
Google has worked so hard on the Play Store over the last few years making the Play Store

957
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,700
competitive and integrating all of this – all of the movie and TV shows in with the Play

958
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,700
Store now, right?

959
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,780
Because it's all about the content.

960
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,400
And if you don't – the only way you get the content is by having the deals.

961
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,420
And those deals only happen between these major corporations.

962
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,060
And if you are an open source project, you're only going to get so far when it comes to

963
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,900
the smartphone market.

964
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,060
And I think a lot of it – what a lot of it comes down to is for those of us who are

965
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:04,700
enthusiasts that want to maybe be able to install whatever OS we want on our smartphone,

966
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:09,000
our best bet is going to be stuff that's built off of the stuff that is benefiting

967
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,520
from the companies that can make those deals.

968
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,380
So like Google's ASOP or AOSP, right?

969
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,620
Or Canonical's images of Ubuntu Touch where they've gone through the trouble of creating

970
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:22,020
these deals and getting that technology in there.

971
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,120
And some of that makes it out to the open source version.

972
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,300
And then we can rebuild off of that.

973
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,300
Right.

974
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,860
We have the resources because they've published them.

975
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
Right.

976
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:34,220
But the concept that somebody like say Jupiter Broadcasting thought, oh, here's a great

977
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,220
idea.

978
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,100
Let's make the Jupiter Broadcasting OS that automatically pulls in all our shows and puts

979
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,100
them on your home screen.

980
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,100
All right.

981
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,100
We'll go to the market with that.

982
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,020
It just could never happen for a small company.

983
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,020
It could never happen.

984
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,980
And Canonical is barely big enough to make it happen.

985
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:55,040
Especially for something which is probably doing some intrusive things to the device.

986
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,040
I would imagine.

987
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,100
There's a reason why they only support one device and almost certainly it's because it's

988
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:05,500
patched quite heavily in order to make this work in the same way that the image that we

989
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,420
had for Ubuntu for Android was patched quite heavily.

990
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,460
Maybe they're doing something very different, something very new.

991
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:16,020
Then again, though, I think you're really touching on an important point there, Popi.

992
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:21,420
But then again, if they double down on just focusing on Nexuses and I was a Nexus user

993
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:26,660
who wanted this particular functionality, I would be willing to sort of wait a couple

994
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:29,540
of weeks to get my updates or whatever it would take.

995
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,860
And if you're not a Nexus user, if you're a Samsung user and there are an enormous number

996
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:39,140
of Samsung users out there, this is just not going to happen for you.

997
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:47,600
So you can't possibly use this thing unless you've got their special patch gun or whatever

998
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,260
super source or magic ingredients they've put in.

999
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,420
If you're using any one of the non-Nexus things, you're screwed.

1000
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,420
You can't use it.

1001
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,420
Probably.

1002
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,420
I think you're right.

1003
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,540
And I think the key part of them being successful would be not even bothering with devices like

1004
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:09,700
the Samsung, which is going to, I admit, limit their market substantially and be really,

1005
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,100
really on top of updates.

1006
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,900
You've really got to be on top of updates because the reason you're going to Nexus a

1007
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:18,140
lot of times is to get that pure Google edition with the monthly updates.

1008
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,140
Actually keep up with it.

1009
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,140
Yeah.

1010
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,140
No, no, no.

1011
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,220
The reason you're buying a Nexus is because it's easily unlocked.

1012
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,060
That's the reason they're using that device.

1013
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,100
It's not that there's AOSP sources for it.

1014
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,100
No, I mean end users.

1015
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,660
That's why end users are buying Nexus devices.

1016
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,660
Oh, I see.

1017
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,860
So if you're going to get into that market, you need to deliver on those things because

1018
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,780
that's why you're buying a Nexus device.

1019
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,780
So yeah, you're right.

1020
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,780
It has a particular-

1021
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:43,140
And the Android still needs to work well too.

1022
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,020
And it feels like everybody who tries this comes to the conclusion, no, we just need

1023
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,420
to own the device or we need to partner with the device.

1024
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,940
We need to work tightly with the device.

1025
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,940
Wimpy, you had a point you wanted to make about some interesting business agreements

1026
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:00,140
recently which kind of prove some more and more leverage that Canonical appears to be

1027
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,140
building.

1028
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:06,020
Well, I don't know if Canonical are going to be building leverage in this area, but

1029
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:13,020
it was recently announced that Canonical are going to be working with AT&T to develop their

1030
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,740
infrastructure and services and what have you.

1031
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:21,620
And you'd hope that maybe there might be some crossover there to mobile.

1032
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:28,860
And if there is, AT&T could be the partner Canonical could work with to give them the

1033
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:37,220
clout in the industry to maybe bring some services to the Ubuntu platform that might

1034
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,260
be difficult to achieve on their own.

1035
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:48,100
You know, I think even if this – so quick recap for those of you who may not roughly

1036
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,660
know what we're talking about.

1037
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:54,540
During scale roughly, it was announced that Canonical and AT&T are partnering so that

1038
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:58,980
essentially the vast, vast, vast majority of AT&T's clout infrastructure will all

1039
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,980
be Ubuntu powered.

1040
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:00,980
Right.

1041
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,240
A huge, huge win because it's like we're talking tons of different types of services

1042
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,740
and devices that will be running Ubuntu.

1043
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:11,420
And this is the kind of agreement that any large company would love to have.

1044
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,540
So this was a major win.

1045
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,860
And the reason why I want to underscore why it's a big win is because even if it never

1046
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:22,620
translates to an Ubuntu device on an AT&T network, what it does translate to is legitimacy

1047
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,100
for Canonical and brand Canonical.

1048
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:30,620
And I think I want to make sure that everybody fully grasps that because this is legitimacy

1049
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:34,660
for brand Canonical in the telecom space.

1050
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,980
Big enterprise telco.

1051
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,660
It's a pretty big deal even if it never actually translates to an AT&T phone.

1052
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,300
It's still a win for Canonical.

1053
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:48,380
And it's the kind of deal that Red Hat or SUSE would have loved to have landed.

1054
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:52,460
Now, the Red Hat doesn't have tons of great deals like this on their own.

1055
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,460
Obviously, they do.

1056
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,460
But yeah.

1057
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,460
Okay.

1058
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,980
Andy, I'll let you finish off this story before we move on to the next one.

1059
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,980
Go ahead.

1060
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,980
Your thoughts.

1061
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,580
Well, I think you're right.

1062
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,860
The AT&T, yeah, they're giving legitimacy.

1063
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,460
I think the legitimacy is the bigger win here because otherwise, you're kind of like Apple

1064
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:18,620
trying to break into the set-top box market and that you without – because the market

1065
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:23,060
is so locked up with regulations and everything else.

1066
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:27,520
And like I was saying earlier, a lot of times it's the deals that actually make or break

1067
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,880
you in the smartphone market and that kind of legitimate deal sort of underscores why

1068
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,260
a company at Canonical is going to have a better shot than the guys at Meru.

1069
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:42,780
However, that being said, if they had a downloadable image right now for the Meru image and I had

1070
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,940
my – NOAA has my Nexus 5.

1071
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:45,940
I've got one.

1072
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:46,940
I'll devote to the cause.

1073
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,940
Yeah?

1074
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,940
Mm-hmm.

1075
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,940
Well, if they had – they don't have a downloadable image.

1076
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,940
They're not even shipping –

1077
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,940
As soon as they do, though.

1078
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,940
Someone gets that to us.

1079
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:53,940
But I guess some people have tried it.

1080
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:54,940
Some people have tried it.

1081
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,620
But if there is a sign-up, they have like a mailing list you can get on.

1082
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,060
But if somebody out there knows how to get an image, we'll try it.

1083
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,340
Because that said, this I would try on a Nexus 5.

1084
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,340
Like nobody's business.

1085
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,420
And the fact that it's Debian-based is kind of cool, too.

1086
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,420
Yeah.

1087
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,420
So –

1088
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:10,620
They'll be like the Roku cell phones.

1089
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,620
Maybe.

1090
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:15,960
I mean, you know, honestly, it's something I would love to try on my phone.

1091
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,620
It really is something I'd love to try.

1092
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:23,620
So if they ship something, you know, XFCE desktop based on Debian 8 and I still get

1093
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:28,860
my – I can still run all my standard Android apps on the phone while I'm – I mean,

1094
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,620
that is actually something I'd be willing to give a shot.

1095
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,220
Just to see how it works.

1096
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:36,820
Hey, while we're talking about this kind of thing, real quickly here, I know we covered

1097
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,820
on last.

1098
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:38,880
We don't have to go into it in big detail here.

1099
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,540
But we do have an officially shipping – this is pretty exciting – an officially shipping

1100
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:45,540
Ubuntu tablet.

1101
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,540
Tablet.

1102
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:54,900
The Neo Q2, the BQ Aquarius M10 Ubuntu edition, 10.1-inch tablet, quad-core MediaTek processor,

1103
00:47:54,900 --> 00:48:00,580
high-capacity battery, they say, 1080p camera, Heyo, 2 gigabytes of RAM, and 8-megapixel

1104
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,740
rear camera.

1105
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,740
So –

1106
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,740
And a micro SD card slot.

1107
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,740
Okay.

1108
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,740
Yeah.

1109
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,740
That is true.

1110
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:09,540
Poppy, I look at this and I think that's pretty exciting.

1111
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:18,140
But in the era of the iPad Pro and the Nvidia Shield tablets, 2 gigabytes of RAM, and the

1112
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,660
1.5 gigahertz processor, is this an entry-level device in your opinion?

1113
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:25,580
Or do you think this is going to be something that maybe was actually going to perform pretty

1114
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,580
well?

1115
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,860
Because I don't – I've never – I'm coming from an Android experience where Android

1116
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:32,380
kind of has a lot more overhead.

1117
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:36,220
I think, as always, it depends on what you're going to do with the device.

1118
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:43,300
If you're going to try and run LibreOffice and open a ton of very heavy presentations,

1119
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,300
then of course it's not going to be the smoothest of experiences.

1120
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:52,940
But if you're opening a browser and a terminal and a couple of other apps, then maybe not

1121
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,940
so much of a problem.

1122
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,740
I think I'm mostly worried about 2 gigabytes of RAM.

1123
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,740
Yeah.

1124
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,700
Because I can kill 2 gigabytes of RAM just in my browser.

1125
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:01,540
And 11 gigs available on the hard drive.

1126
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,540
If you don't have an SD card.

1127
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,500
You know, I could see me moving home over to micro SD.

1128
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,180
I could see that working.

1129
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,980
But I'm worried about the RAM.

1130
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:08,980
Yeah.

1131
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:15,580
And we've been doing a lot of work to try and trim down what our apps are using.

1132
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,220
And obviously it depends which apps you're choosing.

1133
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:22,220
Because some of them are less heavyweight than others, shall we say.

1134
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:28,980
Some of them – if you're using pure C++ games, for example, they start instantly and

1135
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,540
don't consume a huge amount of memory.

1136
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:39,240
Whereas if you open a web browser and open a ton of web apps or use WebRTC to chat to

1137
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:44,300
your friends or hangouts or something like that, then you're going to exhaust the memory.

1138
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:50,220
And we use similar techniques to Android and iOS to kill applications that are using memory

1139
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,940
that are least recently used.

1140
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,940
That kind of stuff.

1141
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,980
So we do our best to make best use of the memory that we have available.

1142
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,980
Sure.

1143
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,980
Right.

1144
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,420
And I'm hopeful, actually, that it works out to be a good thing.

1145
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,740
If it works and it's pretty usable now –

1146
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,700
I'd certainly like to try it.

1147
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:11,900
With two gigs of RAM and a quad-core 1.5 gigahertz MediaTek, then when the next device comes

1148
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:14,300
out, it should probably run even better, I would hope.

1149
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,300
So I think I'm in.

1150
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,860
I think I'm going to get one as soon as they're – I hope that the pre-sales process

1151
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,860
is pretty straightforward.

1152
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:19,860
But I don't really –

1153
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,860
Yeah.

1154
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,860
Unfortunately, we have no control over the way that our partners –

1155
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,860
Right.

1156
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:23,860
What about the idea that –

1157
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:31,980
So if they're using lights or games or something, we don't control that.

1158
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,980
What about the idea that –

1159
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:33,980
Yeah.

1160
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:37,940
I just – I worry that, too, the tablets aren't selling that well right now.

1161
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,140
I'm not buying the tablet anytime soon.

1162
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,140
Really?

1163
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:47,740
But the thing is that we get a lot of flak that people don't want to switch from Android

1164
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:51,780
or iOS yet because Ubuntu isn't completely ready for the mainstream.

1165
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,420
And we're completely aware of that.

1166
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:57,700
We know there are some core applications that are not serviced by the platform.

1167
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:01,620
We know there are things missing, and we're working on those things.

1168
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:06,340
We know there are certain services that the platform doesn't provide that I know a lot

1169
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,140
of people would like us to provide and app developers would like us to provide.

1170
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:18,500
And I don't think we should dismiss out of hand these devices when really you and I,

1171
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:23,760
the kind of people – not end users, not my mom or my daughter or my son – but you

1172
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,180
and I, us techies, are the kind of people that this is aimed at.

1173
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:33,820
And I think we're the kind of people who could make this platform better and evangelize

1174
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:39,460
for it and advocate its use when maybe in a year's time there's something with many,

1175
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,180
many more cores, much more RAM, and all the applications are already there.

1176
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,180
Right?

1177
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,180
Yep.

1178
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,180
You've got to start somewhere.

1179
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:49,620
And I'm willing to jump in kind of early as long as the price is right.

1180
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,620
And so we'll see.

1181
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,460
I'm just looking forward to it.

1182
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:56,280
And I bet pretty soon after that thing ships, you'll start seeing images for other devices

1183
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,160
show up and it's going to go from there.

1184
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,980
Real quickly, just one of our favorite distros here on the show we'd like to give a mention

1185
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:06,300
to when they have a new update, Corora 23 is out.

1186
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,300
It's out.

1187
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:13,600
It's taken a long ass time since – I mean I don't – they blame it on – they say

1188
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:18,980
the three months we've been waiting for this thing is because of RPM Fusion repositories

1189
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:19,980
to be declared stable.

1190
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,420
But they just haven't gotten around to it.

1191
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:27,180
The community packages that they include from RPM Fusion, like multimedia codecs and kernel

1192
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,180
drivers –

1193
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,180
Which kind of makes Corora what it is.

1194
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,180
Yeah.

1195
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,980
Kind of depend on RPM Fusion.

1196
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:37,020
But they feel like they're stable enough, they're going to start shipping them now.

1197
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,340
So Corora 23 is officially out.

1198
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:46,380
And once they make the RPM Fusion repository stable, they'll automatically switch your

1199
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:50,620
Corora installation over probably through an update.

1200
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,620
I don't get it.

1201
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:57,300
I mean I don't mean to – I don't mean – and the RPM Fusion, great project, Corora,

1202
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,420
great project, 2000 and effing 16.

1203
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,000
Are you kidding me?

1204
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,500
When you have the openSUSE build service out there that anybody could use, are you kidding

1205
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,020
me?

1206
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,060
This is ridiculous.

1207
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,620
You have one of the most – it is really a crap show, Fedora.

1208
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:17,140
You have a real crap show on your hands here because you have yourselves one of the most

1209
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:21,300
compelling Linux distributions backed by one of the most compelling companies in tech,

1210
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:25,980
period, full stop, Red Hat, not to mention one of the coolest Linux companies out there.

1211
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,740
And yet you can't get a distribution that has actual software available for it.

1212
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,700
Its situation has gotten better with copper, much, much better with copper.

1213
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,140
Not good enough.

1214
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,180
Not good enough.

1215
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:42,260
And while you guys can't get this out of the gate, you have Canonical working on snappy

1216
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,740
packages or snap packages or whatever the hell they're called that can just go pull

1217
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,900
crap down from GitHub automatically.

1218
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:52,860
You've got Arch which has had the AUR for who knows how long and FreeBSD which is older

1219
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:56,220
than your grandpa has been around with the ports tree forever.

1220
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,340
And all of these different places have figured out how to get software available for the

1221
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:03,020
end user in a reasonable time that is relevant to their current interest.

1222
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,900
And you have projects out there like OwnCloud and one of the talks, by the way, one of the

1223
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:07,900
talks at scale.

1224
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:12,180
In fact, Mark Shuttleworth himself up on stage at scale said that one of the things Canonical

1225
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:17,740
hears all the time from upstream is, oh yeah, don't use our packages in the repo.

1226
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,820
Don't use the package that's in the repo.

1227
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,420
Think about that for a second.

1228
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:26,300
This is what upstream projects are telling people that are deploying their software in

1229
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,820
high production environments.

1230
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:31,080
They're saying don't use the package repos.

1231
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,680
Don't use the package in the repo.

1232
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,940
That's what they're telling them.

1233
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:36,500
This is Mark Shuttleworth admitting this up on stage.

1234
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,700
And Fedora is the worst of it.

1235
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,700
OpenSUSE.

1236
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:45,560
So nobody uses OpenSUSE and yet it's got a better software situation than Fedora does.

1237
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,500
And Copper has been around and it's getting much better but it's still not good enough.

1238
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:53,720
And RPM Fusion has worked so hard and diligently to try to provide a solution for this.

1239
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,980
It is not good enough.

1240
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:56,780
They need to address it at a project level.

1241
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:59,420
They need to empower their community.

1242
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,740
To be better and better in sync.

1243
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,740
I don't know.

1244
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:02,740
Maybe they need to.

1245
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,740
I don't know what's wrong with Copper.

1246
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,900
I know.

1247
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,900
I know.

1248
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:12,260
I might have an idea as to what's going on here.

1249
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:15,620
I honestly – and just let me finish and then I'll let you jump in.

1250
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:22,540
The reason why this upsets me is I honestly would probably run Fedora full time if these

1251
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:25,180
– and if this could be solved.

1252
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:30,580
And I don't understand – I guess I've always come from the position because I talked

1253
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:34,900
to so many people who switched to Linux and myself, I came into Linux initially through

1254
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:35,900
a Red Hat path.

1255
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,820
There are so many people who come to Linux because of Red Hat and they find – and so

1256
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:45,620
for them not to have solved this by now, I just – I cannot grasp it as somebody who

1257
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,540
has been watching this for literally an effing decade.

1258
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,460
I cannot grasp why they haven't solved this problem yet.

1259
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,460
Go ahead.

1260
00:55:52,460 --> 00:56:00,540
I'm actually thinking that part of the problem is that they don't have the numbers of developers

1261
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:07,540
or whatever is needed to actually develop all of these little fissures and fractures

1262
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:12,560
like Cora, RPM fusion and all these little minor projects.

1263
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:16,020
So what happens is these projects just take forever to come out.

1264
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:21,260
Whereas OpenSUSE, even though they don't have a large community, they're focused mostly

1265
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:30,060
on the core and just a few little extras like the build service and whatnot.

1266
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:35,580
Yeah, I think Fedora should look at SUSE and go, hmm, jeez, they seem to be really nipping

1267
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,580
at our heels these days.

1268
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,380
I mean, I made a joke – I made a crack about OpenSUSE there, but in reality Fedora should

1269
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:44,860
be looking behind – over their shoulder and going, oh, jeez, what are these guys doing?

1270
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:48,980
There seems to be a lot of steam and a lot of momentum here.

1271
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:52,740
Especially when Fedora has already done so much in terms of switching to DNF and like

1272
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,660
they've modernized a lot of their infrastructure and this is like the last component that needs

1273
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,660
to be dealt with.

1274
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,740
Yeah, so now you've got to – this is actually really it.

1275
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,900
This is – you've got the different rings of Fedora or whatever they call it and you

1276
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,260
got Fedora desktop and workstation as they call it.

1277
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:11,480
And you have all this stuff set up now, but yet what you don't have is the user base

1278
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,020
that makes it usable.

1279
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:17,100
And there's other distros out there that are kicking their ass and I don't understand

1280
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,380
why they're getting their ass kicked so bad here.

1281
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:23,020
I mean, look at Arch or look at OpenSUSE or look at Ubuntu, even though they've got

1282
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,020
PPAs right now.

1283
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,020
I mean, look what they're doing there, right?

1284
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,060
It is so much better than what's happening at Fedora.

1285
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,300
It's getting way better too because people that are listening to this are going to be

1286
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:34,820
like, Chris, you're way off base on this and they're going to cite copper and all

1287
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:35,820
of this.

1288
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:39,060
And I will say I just don't think it's enough.

1289
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,660
Having watched this for as long, it is so much better than it used to be.

1290
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:45,520
So I don't want to diminish it, but it's just not enough yet.

1291
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:52,340
And when I see something like – when I see something like Karora, the reason why Karora

1292
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:59,180
is of note is because it is one of the few actually usable distros based off Fedora.

1293
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,940
That's why it's even of note.

1294
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:03,060
One of our favorites, as you said.

1295
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,660
That needs to tell you something right there.

1296
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:09,900
If you think I'm wrong, answer me why that's fact.

1297
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:14,300
Why are there so few well-known usable distros based off Fedora?

1298
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,140
It's because of this fundamental problem they struggle with.

1299
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,900
It's a loss if you base it off Fedora.

1300
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,500
You're appealing to Fedora users.

1301
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,940
Anyways, I'll leave it at that.

1302
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,620
I just find it to be very, very, very frustrating.

1303
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,620
All right.

1304
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:31,180
Am I going to have any thoughts before we move?

1305
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,180
No.

1306
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,660
I mean, and I love it.

1307
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,500
Like I literally say I would switch to it.

1308
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:38,380
I think there's a lot of Fedora love on JB.

1309
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,380
Thank you.

1310
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:40,380
I try.

1311
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,900
You know, I think it's a good distro.

1312
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,180
They push the boundaries in awesome ways.

1313
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:44,740
I like the folks behind it.

1314
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,740
Yep.

1315
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:48,220
There's just some packages you kind of have.

1316
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:53,060
You know what's funny is how underrepresented it is sometimes too at community events.

1317
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:58,080
Sometimes it gets pretty good representation and sometimes it feels like OpenSUSE and Ubuntu

1318
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,420
are the only two distros that exist at events.

1319
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:05,060
Bobby, did you get that sense at scale?

1320
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:11,060
Well, I'm biased, so don't ask me.

1321
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:12,060
I suppose.

1322
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,060
Yeah, I suppose.

1323
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:18,140
But you know, the reason I say that is like there's usually a Red Hat booth and a Fedora

1324
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:22,580
booth, but not always.

1325
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,140
And sometimes they don't put a ton of effort into one of the booths.

1326
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:30,220
Like one time, sometimes the Red Hat booth gets a lot of effort and sometimes like Ruth

1327
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:34,380
mans the Fedora booth and she brings like sometimes what Ruth does is she'll Amazon

1328
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:38,380
Prime in some furniture and she does a nice setup, but it's like as far as she can take

1329
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,380
it.

1330
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,860
And sometimes they assign her at the Red Hat booth and then she's not at the Fedora booth

1331
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,860
and like nothing happens.

1332
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,700
And that's kind of what happened at scale.

1333
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:52,020
Were there more, like in total, were there more BSDs there than there were Linux distros?

1334
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:57,540
Well there were two BSD booths and three Linux distros.

1335
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,540
So that was close.

1336
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,540
Yeah.

1337
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,540
That's frightening.

1338
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:01,540
They're coming, Wes.

1339
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:06,180
This is going to be BSD unplugged in the air, isn't it?

1340
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:09,580
They're coming for you and we've already got our new show planned.

1341
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:14,000
Welcome to BSD Unplugged, your weekly BSD talk show that's too busy getting actual work

1342
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,980
done to care about what your silly display server.

1343
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:17,980
My name is Alan.

1344
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:18,980
There you go.

1345
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:22,940
He'll be running our display server before too long.

1346
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,680
Oh, it's going to happen.

1347
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,680
It's going to happen.

1348
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,680
All right.

1349
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,460
So this, we should really move on.

1350
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,340
I got all off on a tear about Fedora and I love them.

1351
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,220
I shouldn't have done it, but.

1352
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:34,220
But they frustrate you.

1353
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,500
There are some things that don't frustrate you though.

1354
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,660
Well, that's true, Wes.

1355
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,060
There's some things that make life simpler.

1356
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,620
You know, there are some things that make life simpler, like Ting.

1357
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:46,100
Ting is on a mission to make mobile simpler, which makes it less frustrating.

1358
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,380
Really it does make it less frustrating too because they got great support.

1359
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,300
They got a great control panel.

1360
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,900
Only $6 per month, flat rate for the line.

1361
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,820
And there's just your usage on top of that.

1362
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,220
Go to linux.ting.com.

1363
01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:00,260
Go to linux.ting.com to save and support the show.

1364
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,740
You get $25 off a device.

1365
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,140
That's serious.

1366
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:06,540
Or if you bring a compatible device and they got GSM and CDMA, what?

1367
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,540
So like everything works.

1368
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,540
Pretty much.

1369
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,540
You can check out.

1370
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:10,540
They got a page.

1371
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:11,540
It tells you.

1372
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,540
You can check it.

1373
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,540
Now here's the thing.

1374
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,540
Average monthly bill per device, $23.

1375
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,580
So you get $25 in credit.

1376
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,060
It paid for more than my first month, which was like years ago now.

1377
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,500
They have a savings calculator so you can see how much you would save.

1378
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,100
I got picked out a couple of really good devices I think are good value.

1379
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:35,740
The LG Volt 2, $183, ships tomorrow, SIM card included, tri-band LTE, $183, unlocked, no

1380
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,580
contract, pay for what you use.

1381
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,980
It's a pretty nice Snapdragon processor.

1382
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:42,060
Hmm, that's a name brand.

1383
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,060
Oh yeah.

1384
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:44,060
Oh yeah.

1385
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,060
That's true.

1386
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,060
That's true.

1387
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:50,500
You know, that actually, you know what, I'm going to take it over immediate deck.

1388
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,500
All right.

1389
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,660
And also, how about this one?

1390
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:56,500
Here's another name you like, Wes, the OnePlus 2.

1391
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,500
How about that?

1392
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,380
$349, unlocked from the Ting network.

1393
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,380
Love it.

1394
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:03,380
USB-C.

1395
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,380
You know, they all, yeah, that's true.

1396
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,020
And you know, they've also got like the Nexus I devices.

1397
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:08,780
They got the Moto Pure editions on here.

1398
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:11,220
They got the internet phone fives and sixes on here.

1399
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,100
What are those you've got on screen?

1400
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,180
The feature phones, buddy.

1401
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,180
Look at that.

1402
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,180
Dura XT.

1403
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:18,220
$47 for the Dura XT.

1404
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:19,220
That looks tough.

1405
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:20,220
Yeah.

1406
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,780
If you want to step up to a camera, $58.

1407
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:27,740
Now you know what, seriously, no contract, no early termination fee.

1408
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:31,300
You pay for what you use and you can also turn the line off when you're not using it.

1409
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,260
Like as an emergency phone or a phone for the kid or a phone for anybody, you know,

1410
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,420
I mean, geez, really.

1411
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,600
Or like Noah's like, here's my personal bat line.

1412
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,580
You can, that's what he uses it for.

1413
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:46,420
I also, if you're not a performance hound, the Moto G first gen, $63.

1414
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:49,820
You're still getting updates to get a nice near Google experience on that one.

1415
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:50,820
Yeah.

1416
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:53,000
I can say near Google because they got a couple of Moto X things on there, but most people

1417
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,540
seem to think they like them.

1418
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,100
I have not tried it personally.

1419
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,100
Kyocera Vibe, $150.

1420
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:00,660
I mean, so many great, the Netgear Zing, which is what I use on my road trips, and I like

1421
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,060
that one because it's got the OLED touch screen right there so you can see all your business

1422
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:04,060
right there.

1423
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,060
Fancy.

1424
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:06,060
Mm-hmm.

1425
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:07,060
Mm-hmm.

1426
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,540
So many Wi-Fi devices are connected right there on the screen.

1427
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,820
Super nice because then I can see if somebody's trying to connect to my Wi-Fi.

1428
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:13,820
That's handy.

1429
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:15,860
I only have two computers.

1430
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:16,860
Exactly.

1431
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,860
Linux.ting.com.

1432
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,220
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

1433
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:27,860
Plus, we got that awesome URL, Linux.ting.com.

1434
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:31,020
One of the things I've always wanted to be able to do when I'm running a virtual machine

1435
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,820
is get legitimate 3D performance.

1436
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:33,820
Yes.

1437
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:34,820
Legit 3D performance.

1438
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:37,300
You can't settle for closed source solutions to do so.

1439
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,300
Right.

1440
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:41,660
And we've all read about doing a VGA pass-through in your virtual environment, and we've all

1441
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:44,780
read the guide and been like, oh, jeez, I don't want to do that.

1442
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,780
And then you see the videos of people doing it, and you're like, oh, maybe I could do

1443
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:48,780
it.

1444
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,060
You go into a separate X server, and you've got, oh, yeah.

1445
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,500
Let me tell you about Virgil 3D.

1446
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:57,620
This is something that's been made possible by a feature that shipped in the latest Linux

1447
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,620
kernel that I didn't actually notice at first.

1448
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:01,780
You did.

1449
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:02,780
You caught it, didn't you?

1450
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:03,780
Yes, I did.

1451
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:10,220
So in kernel 4.4, we got a brand new, very neat feature that is going to help change

1452
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:11,940
all of this.

1453
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:13,420
It's called VertIO GPU.

1454
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:19,100
It's a driver you've maybe heard of before, but it's got a whole new feature set.

1455
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:22,900
In this release, it allows the virtualization guest to use the capabilities of the host

1456
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,480
GPU to accelerate 3D rendering.

1457
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:32,940
In practice, this means a virtualized Linux guest can run an OpenGL game while using

1458
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:36,260
the GPU acceleration capabilities of the host.

1459
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:37,660
And we'll talk more about this here in a second.

1460
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:42,500
Now, it requires running QEMU 2.5, amongst other things.

1461
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:51,260
So we've heard of virtualization 3D capabilities in things before, like VirtualBox.

1462
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:57,260
VirtualBox has some limited OpenGL support, but the way they're doing it is actually pretty

1463
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,260
wonky.

1464
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,620
The way VirtualBox and other virtualization solutions like VMware and Parallels and some

1465
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:06,740
of the other common consumer virtualization products are doing is they're actually trying

1466
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:10,660
to emulate the entire OpenGL stack.

1467
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:13,980
They're essentially acting as an OpenGL client to your host video card.

1468
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:20,300
But the problem is the OpenGL stack is crazy big, a moving target, and honestly has some

1469
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:21,300
problems.

1470
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:24,940
And as the developer of Virgil 3D tells us, it has all kinds of other issues.

1471
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:27,980
I have a quick clip from a conference.

1472
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:33,620
We have VirtualBox, who did an open source graphics adapter, but based on OpenGL.

1473
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,620
Insane.

1474
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:39,620
But basically, OpenGL is very big.

1475
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:47,380
And basing your whole hardware abstraction layer on a huge API is, A, insane, and B,

1476
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,860
security implications abound.

1477
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:52,380
It's really hard to prove that you're going to be able to shut this thing.

1478
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,180
And they're having a lot of trouble.

1479
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:56,520
VirtualBox have been going, how are we going to make it even stable?

1480
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,500
So it's like, they can't upstream their drivers because they don't know what to do.

1481
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:07,940
So I mean, it goes on, but you can see how basing it on top of OpenGL would be a horrible

1482
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:08,940
idea.

1483
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:09,940
Yes.

1484
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:10,940
But it's essentially what we've been trying to do for a while.

1485
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:13,420
I looked at that one, and that's a bit insane.

1486
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,660
They have a bit more, they've got a Windows driver at least started, but they also hacked

1487
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:17,660
a lot of things.

1488
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:22,580
There was also a product called VGallium, which used the gallium hardware interface

1489
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:24,060
that I was using.

1490
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:28,500
I remember VGallium, and I don't, I remember it was difficult to set up, but I can't remember

1491
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,500
why.

1492
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,500
Well, he gives us a real quick recap.

1493
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,860
But they didn't go to the next level.

1494
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,520
They basically, it was a research project for Zen.

1495
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,060
He just basically took the gallium code in the top and then shoved it out the bottom.

1496
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:44,620
So the host had to be running a gallium driver with a special API attached to it, so it wasn't

1497
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,620
generic.

1498
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:46,620
You couldn't run it on any sort of drive.

1499
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:47,620
Which is why it was difficult.

1500
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,420
It was very, but it was a research project.

1501
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:53,660
It showed that it could be done, but he never had the time or inclination to actually finish

1502
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:54,660
it off.

1503
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:58,780
But yeah, all of, apart from the VMware one, I think the others are all, have been pretty

1504
01:06:58,780 --> 01:06:59,780
bad.

1505
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:01,220
So the VMware one he thinks is kind of decent.

1506
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:06,900
So this is VGall, a 3D driver, a 3D GPU for QEMU.

1507
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,580
VGall is a research project to investigate the possibility of creating a virtual 3D GPU

1508
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:14,780
for use inside of a QEMU virtual machine that allows the guest operating system to

1509
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:20,020
use the capabilities of the host GPU to accelerate 3D rendering.

1510
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,020
Who is that?

1511
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:22,020
Can you see that?

1512
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,020
Who is that?

1513
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,780
I think they have a hotkey for like control or something, because every now and then we

1514
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,820
hear your wonderful ambiance.

1515
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:31,300
The plan is to have the guest GPU that is fully independent of the host GPU.

1516
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,300
And I want to underscore this point.

1517
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:38,180
This is really slick about this, is what they are, since they're emulating the GPU, you

1518
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,860
are fully independent of the host GPU, which makes it more portable.

1519
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:44,460
You don't have to have a dedicated card to give to pass through.

1520
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,460
Exactly.

1521
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,460
Exactly.

1522
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:50,180
And it makes it obviously probably more cross-platform in terms of cards and CPUs.

1523
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:54,180
The project entails creating a virtual 3D capable graphics card for virtual machines

1524
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,940
running inside QEMU.

1525
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:00,740
The design of this card is based around the concepts of gallium 3D to make writing MESA

1526
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:04,260
and eventually direct 3D drivers for it easy.

1527
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:06,660
Couple other points.

1528
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,420
Initial groundwork got laid in kernel 4.2.

1529
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:13,180
It contains the mode setting only drivers, but Linux 4.4 contains the 3D supported pieces.

1530
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,620
You got to have Linux 4.4.

1531
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:22,740
QEMU 2.4 contains some of the initial code, but QEMU 2.5 contains 3D support only with

1532
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:28,460
the GTK 3 front end enabled with GL.

1533
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:29,460
So there's a couple of caveats.

1534
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:35,260
You got to have QEMU 2.5 with GTK 3 front end and GL enabled.

1535
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:41,740
But so far, he's been able to just run every damn desktop 3D game he's thrown at it inside

1536
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,140
the virtual machine.

1537
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:48,540
And running inside desktop environments which are 3D accelerated, like Gnome 3.

1538
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:49,540
Nice.

1539
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,540
Yeah.

1540
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,540
It's happening, Wes.

1541
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:54,460
It's where we're getting legitimate 3D capable support.

1542
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:57,020
And it's, I mean, it's here already.

1543
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:58,420
Like it slipped in.

1544
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:01,460
There's a couple of hoops you got to jump through, but it slipped in in the last kernel.

1545
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:05,820
Can you imagine when it's just part of boxes and every VM you spin up, it's just accelerated?

1546
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:07,740
Maybe even Windows VMs?

1547
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:15,940
This is super exciting for me because something I always, particularly as Wimpy will be first

1548
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:21,180
to point out, I have not received my Purism 15 laptop.

1549
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:23,300
I don't know if you knew this.

1550
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,300
No.

1551
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:25,300
I thought you had it for months now.

1552
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,300
Yeah.

1553
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:27,300
No, I have not yet received that.

1554
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,300
That's not in front of me right here?

1555
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,300
No.

1556
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,540
I was hoping the chat room would have a time code of when I first backed the project a

1557
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,540
YouTube time link by now, but we don't have that.

1558
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:37,260
But come on, Wimpy.

1559
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:40,500
As you move, I don't know if you're aware, but I have not yet received my Librem 15.

1560
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:41,500
Were you aware of that?

1561
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,500
I'd heard.

1562
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,500
Gets around.

1563
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:48,300
I don't have a lot of spare machines right now.

1564
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:51,380
I have been, every time we do a distro review, and you might have noticed we haven't done

1565
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:52,380
one for a few weeks.

1566
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:53,380
Yep.

1567
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:55,700
Every time we do a distro review, I have to sacrifice one of my machines.

1568
01:09:55,700 --> 01:10:00,620
Like I got to sacrifice because typically what I would like to do, because I've been

1569
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:05,300
doing this for so long, I like to just have a nice, safe machine, generally it's a System

1570
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,300
76.

1571
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,140
It's a full install experience to really review it.

1572
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:15,020
Because if you don't get the full 3D accelerated desktop these days with like Gnome 3 or Plasma

1573
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:19,180
5, or even if I wanted to install Ubuntu Mate and turn on Compiz and just see how that

1574
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:23,820
works, it's really limiting.

1575
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:28,540
I think this could make it much easier to demo stuff to people, it could make it much

1576
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:29,540
easier to test stuff.

1577
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,140
I mean this is super, super exciting.

1578
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:32,500
And I love that it just is here already.

1579
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,500
We just get it.

1580
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,700
We just get it as being Linux users.

1581
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:40,020
It might make, hopefully it'll make KVM, QEMU a little more accessible.

1582
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:44,540
I know a lot of people who use things like ESXi stacks to do a lot of their home virtualization

1583
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:48,380
needs because KVM, QEMU, they don't get the performance they want or they don't get the

1584
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:50,660
graphics that they're used to with VMware, that kind of stuff.

1585
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:54,500
So maybe this can bring that enterprise experience to home users.

1586
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:59,480
He also says he's working down the road on the capability of doing direct 3D drivers

1587
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:03,500
to make it possible to run Windows clients and get direct 3D support.

1588
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:08,260
ND, isn't this sort of one of these things that you think you only get in Linux because

1589
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:11,580
commercial vendors wouldn't necessarily be all that motivated to work on a feature like

1590
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,540
this in their base OS?

1591
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:23,060
Exactly that, or maybe a PSD, but also because OpenGL APIs, they're moving targets because

1592
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:27,300
you're looking behind this, you're peeping through this hole that Windows has let you

1593
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,940
in to see their magic whatever, right?

1594
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:30,940
Yeah.

1595
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:31,940
That's very true.

1596
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:32,940
It is very true.

1597
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:43,260
I think, too, if I'm wanting one Windows app that requires DirectX, like AutoCAD, or maybe

1598
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,260
it's some game.

1599
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:46,300
I mean, there's got to be tons of them out there.

1600
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,780
I can't even think of all of them.

1601
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:51,220
If there's just one or two things, and if I just had a Windows 7 VM or something that

1602
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:54,460
had direct 3D support...

1603
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:57,700
Easily spin up on one of your nicer machines and just...

1604
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:02,500
Would something like AutoCAD or whatever require super crazy, crazy...

1605
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,460
I don't know exactly what the performance would be like, but if it's decent enough,

1606
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:10,300
that could actually enable a lot of people to switch to Linux.

1607
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,300
Watch out, BSD.

1608
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,300
We're coming for your beehive.

1609
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,300
We're coming for your beehive.

1610
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:15,500
Anybody in the mumble room have any other thoughts on this story?

1611
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:20,300
It'd be great if someone wanted to set this up, or if anyone has any recent stacks set

1612
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,780
up and want to try to run something.

1613
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:22,780
Yeah.

1614
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:23,780
You'd need to have kernel 4.4.

1615
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:28,980
It would also make development of Vulkan easier, too.

1616
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,000
Oh, man.

1617
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,820
It could also make really developing games for SteamOS easier, too.

1618
01:12:34,820 --> 01:12:35,820
Yeah.

1619
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:40,180
That's what I was just thinking, like for OpenQA tests, almost all of it's stuff inside

1620
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:45,420
key movie VMs, and the idea of being able to test 3D accelerated graphics automatically.

1621
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,980
Oh, that'd be so nice.

1622
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:51,220
Testing desktop environments, Wayland, Weston, DLS.

1623
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,220
Wow.

1624
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:53,220
Wow.

1625
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,620
Automated testing gets a huge...

1626
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:59,220
Oh, wow.

1627
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:05,060
Even though I don't support this particularly, this might be a good way to get some Windows-only

1628
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,780
games running in Linux.

1629
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,780
Yeah, absolutely.

1630
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:12,060
Boy, when you think of the gaming aspect of it and the automated testing, which I hadn't

1631
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:15,740
considered, it's worth it just for that.

1632
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:17,180
Being able to do automated testing of...

1633
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:18,980
Well, I'm really excited about this.

1634
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:19,980
I'm going to follow this.

1635
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:23,300
It's worth even forking if you had a Windows Skype on Linux.

1636
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,300
Yeah.

1637
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,300
There you go.

1638
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,300
Yeah.

1639
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,300
Very good one, Ricky.

1640
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,300
Yeah.

1641
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:33,620
You know, you just got to work on a good way to get full camera access under the VM.

1642
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:34,620
Maybe that's good enough already.

1643
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,620
I haven't really tried it.

1644
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:36,620
It's just a USB device.

1645
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:37,940
It shouldn't be that hard.

1646
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:40,220
But you know, I'd fork a comment.

1647
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:47,620
I would, just to clarify what I mean there, if this was code that exists, you could have

1648
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,580
your own test environment based off this.

1649
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:51,300
It doesn't have to even make it into mainline.

1650
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,300
No.

1651
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:53,300
Yeah.

1652
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,420
Oh, I get excited about that kind of stuff.

1653
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,980
I mean, I would love to see it in mainline.

1654
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,860
I mean, it is.

1655
01:13:58,860 --> 01:13:59,860
It is in mainline.

1656
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:00,860
It is.

1657
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:01,860
That's the great thing.

1658
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:02,860
This already exists.

1659
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:03,860
We all get it.

1660
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,340
Like, I can't wrap my head around the fact that this already exists.

1661
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,460
It's on your computer now.

1662
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:10,980
I'm so often talking about things that are coming down the road that I can't even fathom

1663
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,780
the fact that something just has already shipped, and it shipped in January.

1664
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:15,780
It's not even January, Wes.

1665
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:16,780
Very little fanfare.

1666
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,780
And I think I'm already...

1667
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:18,780
Let me see here.

1668
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:19,780
Hold on.

1669
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:21,420
The most important question is which kernel is Chris running right now?

1670
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:22,420
How'd your update go?

1671
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:25,860
Well, I think I updated on Sunday, so I should be pretty current.

1672
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:33,500
I'm currently running 4.4.1, so if I had the right version of QEMU, which I probably do,

1673
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,500
I could get it.

1674
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,500
I could try it.

1675
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,500
Yeah.

1676
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:37,500
That is really cool.

1677
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,980
Well, how about that?

1678
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:39,980
All right.

1679
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,220
Well, I don't know.

1680
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:45,380
I just feel like we should all sing Kumbaya now, because we just all got a feature for

1681
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:48,100
free that the commercial OSs don't even have.

1682
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,100
Ha!

1683
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,100
What do you guys got?

1684
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,100
They got nothing.

1685
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:52,100
You know what else?

1686
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,100
Linux Academy's got me pretty excited.

1687
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:54,540
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1688
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:58,220
Go there right now to get yourself a discount, and check out Linux Academy.

1689
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:00,540
The Linux Academy is upgrading all the freaking time.

1690
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:01,740
These guys are on a roll.

1691
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:05,860
They've been exploding staff-wise, and really exploding feature-wise and content-wise, too.

1692
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:06,860
In fact, I...

1693
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:07,860
Hello there.

1694
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:11,460
I invite you to go over to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged, and then take the tour.

1695
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:17,700
Two thousand three hundred and thirteen, boom, self-paced videos where you can obtain experience

1696
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:21,700
as you need to learn and practice on your lab servers provided by the Linux Academy.

1697
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:25,620
Consider the concept, you guys, with two thousand three hundred and thirteen.

1698
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:27,380
I hear that number changes all the time.

1699
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:28,460
It goes up, Wes.

1700
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:29,460
It goes up.

1701
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,580
And they got staff dedicated to keep the stuff current, too.

1702
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:34,460
They got scenario-based labs, which I think is super slick.

1703
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:37,220
You work in their advanced lab environment while completing scenarios from beginning

1704
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:40,560
to end on lab servers that are live.

1705
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,560
Instructor help is available.

1706
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,160
Did I mention instructor help is available?

1707
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,180
By the way, did you hear?

1708
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:47,060
Instructor help is available.

1709
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:50,700
For these type of topics, I think I should mention the fact that instructor help is available.

1710
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,140
You might need instructor help.

1711
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:53,140
Is that available?

1712
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:54,140
That is available.

1713
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:55,140
Yes.

1714
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:57,880
Instructor help is available at the Linux Academy, and I think that's a big deal for

1715
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,340
these types of topics and concepts.

1716
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:03,300
Here's something I really love, and it makes so much sense.

1717
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,740
I'm surprised that I haven't seen this before.

1718
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:06,740
Graded server exercises.

1719
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:11,000
Linux Academy automatically grades your actions so you can see how well you did.

1720
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Right there, built in.

1721
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,040
Included in all different memberships.

1722
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,660
They have Red Hat stacks, boom, bottom-top.

1723
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:17,940
You want to become a Red Hat expert?

1724
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:18,940
They got it.

1725
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:24,340
They got OpenStack, PHP, Ruby, and the Amazon Web Services.

1726
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,140
As somebody who has accidentally spent too much money on Amazon Web Services learning

1727
01:16:27,140 --> 01:16:31,300
about Amazon Web Services, and somebody who thought he could just jump in this weekend

1728
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:36,780
and set up simple mail services on Amazon, I can tell you one of the really nice features

1729
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:39,860
of Linux Academy is their AWS courses.

1730
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:44,140
Because when you go to do stuff in AWS, they're spinning those instances up for you.

1731
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,660
It's part of your Linux Academy subscription.

1732
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:47,660
All of this stuff is.

1733
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:50,260
Anytime you want to get to any different type of courseware, anytime you want to just jump

1734
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:54,300
into something new, everything is part of your subscription, and they do it in a way

1735
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,900
where they quantify it with just a simple amount of time.

1736
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:01,660
That's going to take you seven hours to learn Ruby.

1737
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,660
You spread that out over a few weeks.

1738
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:03,660
I got seven hours.

1739
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:06,980
In fact, one of the things that's really nice about Linux Academy is they have a system

1740
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:09,540
where you just input your time.

1741
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:12,080
You just say how much time you have available, and they have an algorithm that will create

1742
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,340
detailed learning plans with reminders and daily assignments, labs, and quizzes that

1743
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,340
are due.

1744
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:20,980
They'll also just give you expected completion dates, so you can help schedule your certs,

1745
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:23,460
and then go be a boss.

1746
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,460
Boom.

1747
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:27,580
I think it's a pretty great service, and I think they're a great fit for our audience.

1748
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:30,420
I think they're a really great fit for our audience, and I'd like you to go there, check

1749
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:37,460
them out, and support the show by visiting linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1750
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,460
Don't tell anyone.

1751
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:41,580
Don't tell anyone except for every single person you know.

1752
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:42,580
Yes, tell everyone.

1753
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:48,260
If you're even mildly interested in Linux, Linux Academy is perfect, right?

1754
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:49,260
And you know what?

1755
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:55,380
If you want to just tell everyone you know and make them a nice card, and just put, been

1756
01:17:55,380 --> 01:18:00,700
thinking of you, and maybe you need to improve a little, visit Linux Academy, but put a slash

1757
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,700
unplugged in there.

1758
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:05,660
I almost feel bad, but the part that gets me is that Linux Academy is even useful for

1759
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:10,060
people who might not even be that into Linux, but just want a good job, who are looking

1760
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:11,060
for a career.

1761
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:12,380
Or you want to learn PHP.

1762
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:15,780
I think a lot of people who find Linux Academy useful, too, are folks that ended up in a

1763
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:20,260
job where now Linux is part of the stack, and now they have to do that, and then also

1764
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:23,960
for people who have worked with Linux for a really long time, and they know they're

1765
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:28,780
missing either a couple fundamentals, or a refreshment on the fundamentals would be necessary,

1766
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:32,100
or even in my case, what was necessary, is I discovered at some point when I was doing

1767
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:37,460
the standard career thing was, I actually need to have proof that I know this stuff.

1768
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:41,860
And what's great, and something we've watched over the years with Linux Academy, is they

1769
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:44,500
are really becoming a known brand.

1770
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:45,980
And so, having Linux Academy on their app-

1771
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:46,980
Yeah, trusted.

1772
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:47,980
Yeah.

1773
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:50,840
And now with their partnership with the Linux Foundation, that takes it even further.

1774
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:58,900
And so, for people that are playing the corporate game, I think this would have been a... I

1775
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,260
would love to have a tool like this.

1776
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:01,820
I would have loved to have a tool like this.

1777
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,540
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1778
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:09,980
Go check them out, and if nothing else, support the show by visiting them.

1779
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:12,940
So I'm going to do something on the show live, because I don't think this is going to be

1780
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:13,940
available for very long.

1781
01:19:13,940 --> 01:19:15,460
Yeah, probably not.

1782
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,420
It's called Stremio, I think, right?

1783
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:20,980
It's S-T-R-E-M dot I-O.

1784
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:22,700
And it's like popcorn time.

1785
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:23,700
Stremio.

1786
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:24,700
Stremio.

1787
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,700
Popcorn time meets Plex.

1788
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,800
Anybody in the mumble room tried this yet?

1789
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,780
This is sort of like a...

1790
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:30,780
Of course not.

1791
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:31,780
No, of course not.

1792
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:32,780
Okay.

1793
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:33,940
Now, neither have I.

1794
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,020
And I don't condone...

1795
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,100
He's not about to try it now, either.

1796
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:40,140
I am for journalistic purposes about to try it.

1797
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,140
Free pass journalism.

1798
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:45,380
But I won't use it personally after trying it on the show, really.

1799
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,860
But it is something interesting.

1800
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:49,700
So it's Plex Mers meets Popcorn.

1801
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:54,820
And Popcorn time was this app that essentially made BitTorrent streaming really super simple.

1802
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:58,180
So when you go to their website, they automatically detect your OS, and you can download a binary.

1803
01:19:58,180 --> 01:19:59,420
It's a direct download.

1804
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,540
I love seeing that cute little penguin right next to the apple on the window.

1805
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:03,540
Yeah, isn't that nice?

1806
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:04,540
That is really nice.

1807
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:07,860
It's a direct download, and I'm surprised by that.

1808
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:12,940
I think that'll be the first thing that goes, is that won't be a direct HTTP download anymore.

1809
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:15,340
And once you run it, it actually launches as...

1810
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:16,860
Oh, geez.

1811
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:17,860
Apparently I have tar.gz.

1812
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:18,860
Watch this, Wes.

1813
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:19,860
Watch this.

1814
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:20,860
Okay.

1815
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:21,860
So I go...

1816
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:23,460
I don't know how this happens.

1817
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:32,100
I go show in folder, and it launches FileLite, which is the file space.

1818
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:35,380
That's apparently what I've associated with tar.gz files.

1819
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:36,820
MIME types are all messed up.

1820
01:20:36,820 --> 01:20:38,340
I don't know how that even happens.

1821
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:40,060
How does that even become a thing?

1822
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:41,060
I don't even know.

1823
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:46,260
Anyways, so you download Stream.io for your platform of choice, which of course is Linux.

1824
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:47,260
Naturally.

1825
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:48,260
I wouldn't think otherwise.

1826
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:49,260
But look at that.

1827
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:50,260
They've got Windows and Mac too, if you're trapped there.

1828
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,260
I guess.

1829
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:52,260
I suppose.

1830
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:53,260
And then they have a runtime.

1831
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:54,260
You launch the runtime.

1832
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,140
The runtime itself is almost 60 megabytes.

1833
01:20:56,140 --> 01:21:00,940
And then once it's launched up, I first thought, why the hell would I log in with Facebook

1834
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:02,340
or with my own account?

1835
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,900
But you might see why later.

1836
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,900
Or you can do a guest login.

1837
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:08,100
So I'll just do a guest login for purposes of the show here.

1838
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,660
And I'll make it a little bit bigger so you guys that are watching the video version can

1839
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,700
see this.

1840
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,900
And it has an interesting header bar-like design up there at the top.

1841
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:15,900
You see that?

1842
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:16,900
I do.

1843
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:18,940
Very Gnome 3-like, even though this is obviously not a GTK application.

1844
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,380
No, it's not.

1845
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:24,740
So when it first launches, you have your categories here along the left-hand side.

1846
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:27,540
Movies, series, channels, and TV channels.

1847
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:29,300
And the movies has been highlighted on top.

1848
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:34,900
And right there is Spectre, and The Machinist, and Mission Impossible.

1849
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:35,900
All the latest movies.

1850
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:39,260
So let's just click on Spectre, for example, here.

1851
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:45,500
When I click on it, it brings up a very plex-like, here's info about the movie, its director,

1852
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:46,980
its cast, the genre, the summary.

1853
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:48,580
You can play the trailer if you want.

1854
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:49,820
IMDb rating, all that stuff.

1855
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:51,000
So let's click Play.

1856
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:57,420
When you click Play, you are then presented with a couple of really interesting options,

1857
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,220
which are the first and highlighted options.

1858
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:04,900
Buy it on iTunes, buy it on Amazon, buy it on Vudu, or Google Play.

1859
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:09,820
And then there's this other section here, which is in every video and everywhere.

1860
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:11,740
It says popular in your area.

1861
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:15,760
And there's this Juan Carlos Torrance, HD free.

1862
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,100
Now if you click that, it says, hey bro, do you want to get this add-on to do Torrance?

1863
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,540
I say, okay, activate this add-on.

1864
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:24,220
The Torrance add-on is activated.

1865
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:30,200
The movie splash comes up, and then it uses the logo of the movie as the loading screen.

1866
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,380
How clean and slick is that?

1867
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:35,740
This is it buffering the Torrance right now of the movie.

1868
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:38,500
And I'm not going to, I'm just, this is just to show you this is possible.

1869
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,700
I don't plan to watch the movie on the show here, but-

1870
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:42,700
We already bought 10 copies before the show started.

1871
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:46,780
I do own this movie, totally.

1872
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:50,380
So this, it buffers the movie over Torrance and begins playing it.

1873
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:55,820
But now it did present first, buying off of Amazon, buying off of iTunes, buying off of

1874
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:56,860
Google Play.

1875
01:22:56,860 --> 01:23:00,060
And then once it's done that, it starts and it streams off of the Torrance.

1876
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:03,540
And it does this for TV shows, movies, all of it.

1877
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:06,060
And they're trying to get away by seeing what we offer, the commercial version.

1878
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,360
I'm not going to play it because I don't want to get takedown.

1879
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,220
But trust me, it does indeed work.

1880
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:11,580
And you can see they have series.

1881
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:13,380
You could go watch TV shows specifically.

1882
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:16,140
They have TV channels on here.

1883
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:22,700
I don't really know if those are legitimate TV channels or not, but this is a really interesting

1884
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:23,700
app.

1885
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:26,700
Linux support out of the box.

1886
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:27,700
No way this thing's going to last.

1887
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:30,200
What's your bet?

1888
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,700
How many days until it's taken down?

1889
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:35,620
Well, I don't know if it'll be taken down directly or if they'll just remove.

1890
01:23:35,620 --> 01:23:38,420
Maybe Juan Carlos plugin will no longer be there.

1891
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:41,420
Some of the, you know, it's interesting to have kind of the functionality wrapped in

1892
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:45,540
a Linux supported client for things like, look here, I'm watching the BBC on the little

1893
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:46,540
laptop right here.

1894
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:48,780
That was right through the player, right?

1895
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:50,140
Some things maybe you can work it out.

1896
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:54,660
Like maybe I don't want to have to use the Amazon's crappy web interface to watch my prime

1897
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:55,660
videos.

1898
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:56,980
If I can do it here, that might be just as good.

1899
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:57,980
Good call.

1900
01:23:57,980 --> 01:23:58,980
You could use it just for that kind of stuff.

1901
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:01,820
But you got to think the built in torrent streaming, that's going to get them taken

1902
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:02,820
down, right?

1903
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:05,380
Especially with all those movies that just pop right up on the front when you load the

1904
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:06,860
app that's just asking for it.

1905
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:07,860
Yeah.

1906
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:08,860
It's just making them front and center.

1907
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:13,140
It makes the stealing really easy and it's popular in your area.

1908
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:19,700
So they're using Electron, which provides the innovative platform that they've built

1909
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:20,700
around.

1910
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:24,260
They're using Web Chimera, which is a Web Chimera JS allows for streaming to play any

1911
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:26,300
video format with good performance.

1912
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:28,300
They're making it easy to create your own add on.

1913
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,300
All right.

1914
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:33,580
We got to get a JB add on up in here.

1915
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:34,660
That's a good call, Wes.

1916
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:36,140
That's a good call.

1917
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:37,540
And they're an open source project.

1918
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,020
Let's go look at their open source projects on GitHub.

1919
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:40,020
What do you think?

1920
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:42,460
So I see the translations here.

1921
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,940
Visual files, add ons.

1922
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:47,420
I don't see the main player though.

1923
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,420
Nope.

1924
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:50,340
I'm not seeing the main player.

1925
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,340
Where is the main player?

1926
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,340
AirPlay.

1927
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:53,340
That's cool.

1928
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:54,340
Yeah.

1929
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:55,340
One of the things they let you do is stream.

1930
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,340
They do.

1931
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:57,340
They support Chromecast and AirPlay.

1932
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:58,340
Oh, they support Chromecast.

1933
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:59,340
Yeah.

1934
01:24:59,340 --> 01:25:00,340
Dang.

1935
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,340
I know.

1936
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:02,340
It's actually pretty cool.

1937
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:03,340
Yeah.

1938
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:04,340
Wow.

1939
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:05,340
The chat room is really upset that it's 64 bit only.

1940
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:06,340
I'm like.

1941
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:07,340
You guys living in the past?

1942
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:08,340
What are you on?

1943
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:09,340
Chat room, really?

1944
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:10,340
Okay.

1945
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:11,900
Let's take a little straw poll real quick here.

1946
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,460
I'm just going to put this together.

1947
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:22,140
I got to know because there was a rumor that, what was it, that Ubuntu might drop I3A6 support.

1948
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:25,460
There's the new Neon Project only support 64 bit.

1949
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:32,540
You know, when I get the 32 bit ISO, I'm like, I downloaded the wrong ISO, right?

1950
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:33,540
I didn't need that crap.

1951
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:34,540
All right.

1952
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:35,540
So chat room.

1953
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:37,420
I'm going to put together a straw poll.

1954
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:40,900
I want to find out how many of you are on 32 bit or 64 bit.

1955
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:41,900
So I'm just going to put this.

1956
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:42,900
32 bit.

1957
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:43,900
No judgment.

1958
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:44,900
It's not like there's anything wrong with that.

1959
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:45,900
Total judgment.

1960
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:46,900
All right.

1961
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:47,900
No, I'm kidding.

1962
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:48,900
Okay.

1963
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:49,900
Which you got?

1964
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:50,900
You're asking the wrong question, aren't you?

1965
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:51,900
Why?

1966
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:52,900
What is that?

1967
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:53,900
What is it?

1968
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:54,900
What is it?

1969
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:55,900
What is the right question?

1970
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:56,900
You're asking, do you need 32 bit?

1971
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:57,900
Yes or no?

1972
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,260
Not whether you're running it.

1973
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,420
It's whether you need it.

1974
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:02,500
What would you need 32 bit for?

1975
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,180
What am I missing?

1976
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:05,180
Netbooks.

1977
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:06,820
Someone with three little computers.

1978
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:07,820
Well, that's not.

1979
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,740
I wouldn't say need it with a netbook.

1980
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,340
Well, except for the one thing.

1981
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:15,180
The netbooks have got atoms and they're only 32 bit capable.

1982
01:26:15,180 --> 01:26:21,180
Yeah, that's a good point, MiniMC, is that when you use that Stream.io stuff, it's buffered.

1983
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:22,180
Yeah.

1984
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:23,180
You're stealing if you're using torrents.

1985
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:25,620
So I wouldn't, I mean, you got your own moral issues.

1986
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:26,620
You got to figure out that.

1987
01:26:26,620 --> 01:26:28,820
I just think the technology aspect of it's interesting.

1988
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:30,660
All right.

1989
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:31,660
I put together a straw poll.

1990
01:26:31,660 --> 01:26:36,980
I just dropped in the chat room, strawpoll.me slash six seven seven five oh seven three.

1991
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:42,740
I just want to know if you're running, also there's another straw poll going, that is

1992
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:43,740
also happening there.

1993
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:44,740
Another link in the chat room about backup solutions.

1994
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:47,540
We'll talk about more of that in the post show maybe.

1995
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,980
Well, I thought it was interesting.

1996
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:55,300
I think it's also kind of what you said for the Linux users.

1997
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:57,660
I haven't played with it enough yet to say it works like this, but if I could hit the

1998
01:26:57,660 --> 01:27:02,540
Google play button and actually legitimately buy it and have it on Google play and then

1999
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:06,620
have it play in that player and not have to leave that software.

2000
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:07,620
That would actually be worth it right there.

2001
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:08,620
Right.

2002
01:27:08,620 --> 01:27:09,620
I wonder how well it facilitates.

2003
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:12,500
Like if it can provide a nice wrapper and if it's already, like maybe I already have

2004
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:16,580
a Cody system and it's easy enough to do my Google play and my Amazon stuff just in that

2005
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:20,460
or Cody can launch that, something like that, that would work well.

2006
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:21,460
All right.

2007
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:25,860
Real quickly, 95% of the 96% of the votes, we've only gotten 23 because we just, I literally

2008
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:35,940
just put it in the chair, 24 votes, live action polling, 92% on 60, 92% on a 64 bit, 4% on

2009
01:27:35,940 --> 01:27:36,940
32%.

2010
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:38,780
I even put arm in there to be fair.

2011
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:39,780
4%?

2012
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:40,780
64 bit.

2013
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:41,780
Ah jeez.

2014
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:42,780
Ah jeez.

2015
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:43,900
I didn't want to break up the arm.

2016
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:45,900
I wanted to give arm just a solid showing.

2017
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:46,900
Yeah.

2018
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:47,900
Okay.

2019
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:48,900
All right.

2020
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:49,900
That's it.

2021
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:50,900
That's it.

2022
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:51,900
You know what?

2023
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:52,900
That's a sign that it's time to end the show right there.

2024
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:53,900
That's our cue right there.

2025
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:54,900
We'll bring it to an end.

2026
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,100
Linux Unplugged live on a Tuesday.

2027
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,100
We'd love to have you join us in our virtual log.

2028
01:27:58,100 --> 01:27:59,180
Did you know we have one of those?

2029
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,900
You just heard from them.

2030
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:03,460
You can be the guy that keeps hitting this control button.

2031
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:04,460
No.

2032
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:06,580
Don't be that guy.

2033
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:09,420
You know, you've heard of lugs, but then you got to go somewhere.

2034
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:11,020
Maybe you're busy on Saturday.

2035
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:12,020
Shoot.

2036
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:14,700
I think you should still go to your local lugs, but if you can, or if there's not one

2037
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,260
near you, or maybe you just want an extra one.

2038
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:19,180
Or your whole lug wants to come join our virtual lug.

2039
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:20,180
We got a mumble room.

2040
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:21,180
It's open source software.

2041
01:28:21,180 --> 01:28:22,180
It's open to you.

2042
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:23,180
You just have to have a good working mic.

2043
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:27,820
Join us at jplive.tv, linuxactionshow.reddit.com for content and feedback, jupiterbroadcasting.com

2044
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:28,860
slash contact.

2045
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:56,060
Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

2046
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:17,660
So, Wimpy, how long have you been going to your local lug?

2047
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:22,020
Is it local to you, and are you been going for a while, or is this a new thing?

2048
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:27,540
Well, I met Popey at my local lug a long, long time ago.

2049
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:33,820
I've been a bit absent of late, and I've recently started going again, because I've been going

2050
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:39,100
to a lot of Raspberry Pi events over the last year or so, and I've just started going to

2051
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:40,100
my local lug.

2052
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,300
It's about 50 miles away.

2053
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,540
Oh, so it's a bit of a trek.

2054
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:46,020
Look at you converting it for us, too.

2055
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:47,020
That's awful.

2056
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:48,020
That's awful nice of you.

2057
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:49,020
No, no.

2058
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:50,020
I'd have to convert it.

2059
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:51,020
We speak Miles over here.

2060
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:52,020
Oh, okay, good.

2061
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,020
Well, then, so you and I are on a common language.

2062
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:54,860
I didn't know you guys did that.

2063
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:57,860
I thought Miles was literally something that only we stuck to anymore.

2064
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:01,600
That's my education.

2065
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:07,180
So 50 miles is a bit of a trek, but...

2066
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:14,660
The last guest at the lug was the sysadmin for the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation

2067
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:20,640
who built their supercomputer, and the presentation was how to build a supercomputer running on

2068
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,180
Linux, and it was brilliant.

2069
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:23,460
Oh, that would be cool.

2070
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,380
That is great.

2071
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:26,380
I know there's a couple of...

2072
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:30,700
So there's a couple of lugs here, but around here, but I haven't been to the Seattle one

2073
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:31,700
a little while ago.

2074
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:32,700
Oh, I haven't been to that one.

2075
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,700
That would be probably pretty interesting.

2076
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:34,700
How was that?

2077
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:35,700
It wasn't bad.

2078
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,020
They were just kind of getting it back going when I went there, so it'd be good.

2079
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:39,020
Maybe I'll try to go soon.

2080
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:47,500
The lug closest to me sort of focuses more on old timers and old machines.

2081
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:51,780
Yeah, that's common, to be fair, as well.

2082
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:57,700
I don't mind that, but I would love to talk to people in person about current Linux things.

2083
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:00,700
That would be very exciting, and there's probably some there, but...

2084
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:03,680
So you've got the fests and the cons for that.

2085
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:04,680
And the virtual lug.

2086
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:05,680
Yeah.

2087
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:06,680
And the virtual lug, of course, yes.

2088
01:31:06,680 --> 01:31:09,100
There was something I was gonna mention in the post-show.

2089
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,100
Do you remember that?

2090
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:11,100
Oh, the poll, the backup poll.

2091
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:12,100
Yes.

2092
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:13,100
So there is a...

2093
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:14,100
If anybody's interested...

2094
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,100
Who was that?

2095
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:17,300
That was particularly awful.

2096
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:19,340
We have a poll going in the chat room.

2097
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:22,100
You saw the link posted again about...

2098
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:25,820
Although the problem is, whenever we do these kind of polls, everybody talks about how their

2099
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:27,580
preferred backup solution isn't in there.

2100
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:30,500
But there is a poll going right now in the Linux Action Show subreddit about the backup

2101
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,660
solutions that people use on Linux.

2102
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:36,900
And I would be kind of curious to know this information myself.

2103
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:41,100
So it's strawpoll.me, if you're listening after the fact or if you're not in the chat

2104
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:50,300
room, strawpoll.me, slash, 677-0789, and I will repost the link in the chat room.

2105
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:54,300
I'd just be curious to know what people are using, I'd be curious about that.

2106
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:56,620
Right now, simple tar in our sync is winning.

2107
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:57,620
Yeah.

2108
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:00,700
We're probably more interesting than that, guys, so get your votes out for your preferred

2109
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:01,700
solution.

2110
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:02,700
Yeah.

2111
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:03,700
Yeah.

2112
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:06,700
I mean, because what that really means to me is people aren't probably being super pragmatic

2113
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:07,700
about it.

2114
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:09,180
They're probably rolling something together and they're not watching it.

2115
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:10,180
But I don't know.

2116
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:11,180
All right.

2117
01:32:11,180 --> 01:32:12,180
So JBtitles.com, JBtitles.com.

2118
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:13,180
Now we pick our vote.

2119
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:14,180
We have to vote?

2120
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:15,180
We do.

2121
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:16,180
Thanks for being here today, everybody.

2122
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:18,300
We got a great turnout in the Mumba Room.

2123
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:19,500
I love it.

2124
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:23,620
I'm glad I'm like back up to 100% health because I wasn't sure this was going to happen today.

2125
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:24,620
Yeah.

2126
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,620
How was Mr. Dominic?

2127
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:26,620
Did he-

2128
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,620
It was good.

2129
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:28,620
I think when I pulled it out-

2130
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:29,620
Did he tell you were sick?

2131
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:30,620
I don't know.

2132
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:31,620
I don't know how to answer that.

2133
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:32,620
Did you keep that from him?

2134
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:33,620
No, no, no, no.

2135
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,620
No.

2136
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:35,620
It's too good of a story to share.

2137
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:36,620
Too good of a story to share.

2138
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:37,620
Really, Wimpy?

2139
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:38,620
I haven't been keeping track.

2140
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:40,820
Yep, happy lupversary, sir.

2141
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:41,820
Today?

2142
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:42,820
Oh, lupversary.

2143
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:43,820
Very good.

2144
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:44,820
Yes.

2145
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:47,020
Well, as near as it's the closest one.

2146
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,020
So 4th of February.

2147
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:49,020
Wow.

2148
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:50,020
I can't believe the show is that old.

2149
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:51,020
That's crazy.

2150
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:52,020
Yeah.

2151
01:32:52,020 --> 01:32:53,020
Well, I'm glad you've been here.

2152
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:54,020
It's been very nice.

2153
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:55,020
Yeah, I've been very nice.

2154
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:56,020
I can't.

2155
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:57,020
There's a lot of...

2156
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:59,660
So many interesting things have happened in that two years.

2157
01:32:59,660 --> 01:33:02,700
So many interesting things that you've been involved in and that we've been covering.

2158
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:03,700
Yeah.

2159
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:04,700
What a couple of two years.

2160
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:07,380
This has been a great two years for the show.

2161
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:08,380
You know, I tell you.

2162
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:09,980
Well, it was...

2163
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:10,980
It's not much older than that.

2164
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:13,620
I think it's about two and a half years old, the show, isn't it?

2165
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:14,620
Yeah.

2166
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:17,580
Yeah, I tell you, I really am not very good about these things because I think if I think

2167
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:19,220
about it too much, it would overwhelm me.

2168
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:20,660
I just double down.

2169
01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:21,660
I just go for it.

2170
01:33:21,660 --> 01:33:22,660
In fact...

2171
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:26,940
I think the next, like, three shows are more than enough for you to be handling it all.

2172
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:27,940
Yeah.

2173
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:29,940
But every now and then, like, when I stop and think, geez, last 10 years.

2174
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:30,940
Wow.

2175
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:34,580
That is really a long time to be doing something.

2176
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:35,580
Look at that.

2177
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:36,580
You have it right there, the perfect...

2178
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:37,580
Oh, the perfect Linux laptop.

2179
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:38,580
You're kidding me.

2180
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:39,580
Are you kidding me?

2181
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:40,580
Are you joking me?

2182
01:33:40,580 --> 01:33:41,580
Are you joking, Wimpy?

2183
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:42,580
No.

2184
01:33:42,580 --> 01:33:44,700
I haven't put that title.

2185
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:49,140
I think that's the one where if you didn't back it then, it was soon after.

2186
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:50,140
Yeah.

2187
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:51,140
I'm sure I...

2188
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:52,540
The Libreom 15 right here in the show notes.

2189
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:53,700
I think you're kidding me.

2190
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:57,420
I think I backed it in last and then talked about it in LUP.

2191
01:33:57,420 --> 01:33:58,420
Yeah, there it is.

2192
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,420
Look at that.

2193
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:00,420
This has been Coro West.

2194
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:02,660
Yeah, I think your interview started about minute 37.

2195
01:34:02,660 --> 01:34:04,140
In this show?

2196
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:05,140
In that show, yes.

2197
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:07,540
In this episode of LUP, there's an interview with who?

2198
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:08,540
With Todd.

2199
01:34:08,540 --> 01:34:09,540
A minute 37?

2200
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:10,540
There's an interview?

2201
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:11,540
All right.

2202
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:12,540
Okay.

2203
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:13,540
Hold on.

2204
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:14,540
All right.

2205
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:16,780
Let's go see if I can find this because...

2206
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:17,780
No way.

2207
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:18,780
A minute 37?

2208
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:20,460
That's like right, right, right, right, right off the...

2209
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:21,460
No, the 37th minute.

2210
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:22,460
Oh, 37.

2211
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:23,460
I was like, that's like almost during the intro.

2212
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:24,460
I was like, damn.

2213
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:25,460
I started talking to him right away.

2214
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:26,460
Okay.

2215
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:27,460
Yeah.

2216
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:28,460
Okay.

2217
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:29,460
Let's take a look at this.

2218
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:30,460
This is really...

2219
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,460
No way.

2220
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:32,460
Well, let's welcome Todd on the show.

2221
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:33,460
Yeah.

2222
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:36,940
Todd is from Purism and they are currently crowdfunding the Libreom 15.

2223
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:37,940
Oh, geez.

2224
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:43,340
A free Libre software laptop that respects your essential freedoms and I've crowdfunded

2225
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:44,340
it.

2226
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:45,340
Chris, that's you.

2227
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:46,660
It's currently 29 days left on the crowdfunding...

2228
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:47,660
Do I sound younger?

2229
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:48,660
Is that possible?

2230
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:49,660
You do.

2231
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,660
You funded it.

2232
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:51,660
How the hell...

2233
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:52,660
Yes, that you funded it.

2234
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:53,660
Yeah, I did.

2235
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:54,660
How the hell do I sound so young?

2236
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:55,660
So this is...

2237
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:56,660
When did your voice change, Chris?

2238
01:34:56,660 --> 01:34:57,660
I know.

2239
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:58,660
December 2nd, 2014.

2240
01:34:58,660 --> 01:34:59,660
I got to...

2241
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:00,660
I'm just going to...

2242
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:01,660
I got to...

2243
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:02,660
I got to...

2244
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:03,660
This is unbelievable here.

2245
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:04,660
Okay.

2246
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:05,660
So I said I funded it.

2247
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:07,700
I said, I have just a hair so I can catch anything more.

2248
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:08,700
I have the...

2249
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:12,640
I have their crowdfunding page up but they had raised $40,000 at the point of recording

2250
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,640
this.

2251
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:14,640
Well, let's welcome Todd on the show.

2252
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:15,640
Yeah.

2253
01:35:15,640 --> 01:35:21,340
Todd is from Purism and they are currently crowdfunding the Libreom 15, a free Libre

2254
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:26,460
software laptop that respects your essential freedoms, and I've crowdfunded it.

2255
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:30,100
It's currently 29 days left on the crowdfunding effort.

2256
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:37,460
You've raised $41,000 with a goal of $250,000, and Todd, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

2257
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:41,380
Why don't you start by telling us why are you doing a crowdfunding campaign for a Linux

2258
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:42,380
laptop?

2259
01:35:42,380 --> 01:35:43,380
What's the goal here?

2260
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:45,780
Yeah, well thanks for having me on.

2261
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:51,140
So what we're doing is we are clearly crowdfunding to reach a minimum order quantity to manufacture

2262
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:59,340
a motherboard that has the best free software support on any laptop.

2263
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:00,340
So this-

2264
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:01,340
I'll stop it there.

2265
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:03,820
I think you guys can listen to the rest, but I do remember that being one of his specific

2266
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:05,740
arguments is that they had a custom motherboard.

2267
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:07,740
Am I too late to back it?

2268
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:09,740
I like your attitude.

2269
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:10,740
I'm interested.

2270
01:36:10,740 --> 01:36:11,740
Yeah.

2271
01:36:11,740 --> 01:36:16,060
In the time that you have been waiting for that, you have gotten old.

2272
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:19,060
Oh man.

2273
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:22,460
Who said that?

2274
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:29,260
Pretty good.
