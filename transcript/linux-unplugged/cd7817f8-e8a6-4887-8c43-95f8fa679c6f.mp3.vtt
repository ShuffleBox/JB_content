WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I don't know if we've talked about our clone before, Wes.

00:02.000 --> 00:02.920
Maybe we have.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.760
But I've been thinking about our clone again

00:04.760 --> 00:07.840
in the context of getting my stuff out of Google Photos.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.720
And I decided to give it a go.

00:09.720 --> 00:12.840
And it has this nice, I guess you could call it a wizard.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.800
It's a text-based thing that runs you

00:15.800 --> 00:17.440
through connecting to the various services,

00:17.440 --> 00:19.240
in this case, Google Photos.

00:19.240 --> 00:21.600
And then it does this little, I don't know

00:21.600 --> 00:23.180
if you'd call it a hack, but it does this little trick

00:23.180 --> 00:25.120
where it runs a local web server.

00:25.120 --> 00:28.920
It spins one up just to collect the Google authorization token

00:28.920 --> 00:31.000
that gets returned from Google.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
And then it immediately shuts down the web server,

00:34.000 --> 00:35.400
configures your permissions,

00:35.400 --> 00:36.840
and then you can just go in there

00:36.840 --> 00:39.780
and start copying down your Google Photos.

00:39.780 --> 00:41.920
It'll even do specific albums

00:41.920 --> 00:43.760
or things like that if you want.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.900
But I learned it's not exactly perfect.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.360
No, no, it's not.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.200
I mean, our clone is great.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.880
The issue is more on Google's side.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.200
So issue number one is right now,

00:54.200 --> 00:57.200
downloads strips the exif location.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.400
This is a known limitation of the API

00:59.400 --> 01:00.960
and there's an open bug about it,

01:00.960 --> 01:03.440
but who knows when that will get fixed.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.560
That's kind of a bummer.

01:04.560 --> 01:05.600
It sure is.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.520
But number two might be even worse

01:08.520 --> 01:12.920
because right now the API, which our clone uses,

01:12.920 --> 01:15.640
does not allow photos to be downloaded

01:15.640 --> 01:18.020
at their original resolution.

01:18.020 --> 01:19.200
So they might still be useful.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.360
You could still process them and post them on Instagram

01:21.360 --> 01:22.320
or whatever you're trying to do.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.760
But if you're trying to use this

01:24.760 --> 01:27.440
as a way to have Google Photos be your backup

01:27.440 --> 01:31.000
and then make a second copy of your backups,

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
that might not work.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.100
And you might instead need to use something

01:34.100 --> 01:36.120
like Google Takeout.

01:36.120 --> 01:39.580
It's almost as if the best solution might be

01:39.580 --> 01:41.760
just don't use Google Photos.

01:41.760 --> 01:55.600
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.600
My name is Chris.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.600
My name is Wes.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.600
Hello Wes.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.600
It's good to be back from the Montana trip.

01:59.600 --> 02:00.600
This episode is brought to you by aCloud Guru.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.480
You know they are the leader in learning for Cloud Linux

02:02.480 --> 02:03.640
and other modern tech skills.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.680

02:05.680 --> 02:10.240
Get certified, get hired, get learning at aCloudGuru.com.

02:10.240 --> 02:14.320
Coming up on the show today, are you, like me and Wes,

02:14.320 --> 02:18.120
having a hard time kicking the Google Photos habit?

02:18.120 --> 02:20.480
Maybe you're looking for a self-hostable alternative.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.400
They did just recently make a few changes

02:22.400 --> 02:24.320
to the Google Photos deal.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.200
And let's be honest, there is that whole privacy thing

02:27.200 --> 02:28.200
to consider.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.440
So coming up on the show this week,

02:29.440 --> 02:32.420
our buddies Brent, a professional photographer,

02:32.420 --> 02:34.880
and Alex, my co-host on the Self-Hosted podcast,

02:34.880 --> 02:38.660
and a home lab master, really, discuss new and old ways

02:38.660 --> 02:42.160
to manage, organize, index, and search your photo collection,

02:42.160 --> 02:44.720
sort of Google Photo style.

02:44.720 --> 02:48.280
And if that wasn't enough, I spent the weekend,

02:48.280 --> 02:51.560
a long weekend, started on Thursday,

02:51.560 --> 02:53.400
with something special.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.600
The new System76 Launch Keyboard.

02:56.600 --> 03:00.200
They're built in Denver, created from scratch,

03:00.200 --> 03:02.520
right there in Colorado, keyboard.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.680
I rushed back from Montana to receive this package,

03:05.680 --> 03:07.660
and I'm going to share my thoughts on the keyboard

03:07.660 --> 03:12.680
that I say redefines what customizable even means.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.600
But first, with the powers vested in me,

03:15.600 --> 03:18.160
I declare a warm, time-appropriate greetings

03:18.160 --> 03:19.280
to our virtual lug.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.160
Hello, mama room.

03:20.160 --> 03:20.660
Hello.

03:20.660 --> 03:21.160
Hello.

03:21.160 --> 03:21.660
Hello.

03:21.660 --> 03:22.160
Hello.

03:22.160 --> 03:22.660
Hello.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.840
What do you think?

03:23.840 --> 03:25.160
Hello, everybody.

03:25.160 --> 03:26.120
Wow.

03:26.120 --> 03:26.720
Wow.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.600
What a group we have today.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.680
25 of you in there, just solid.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.620
And it's nice to be back.

03:32.620 --> 03:35.160
I missed everybody while I was in Montana.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.800
But you know, it was a good family trip.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.280
We had some adversities, and we had some triumphs,

03:41.280 --> 03:42.920
and we got a lot of swimming.

03:42.920 --> 03:47.920
And I got back to this Launch Keyboard from System76.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.440
It's right here.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.800
I have it plugged in over USB-C to my studio computer.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.840
It is now my studio keyboard.

03:54.840 --> 03:57.600
You haven't switched back, I was wondering.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.440
I got it with the royal keycaps, I think it is,

03:59.440 --> 04:00.480
the slightly quieter ones.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.440
And I've swapped out a few of the keys

04:03.440 --> 04:05.600
already, because it's pretty easy to do that.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.920
It comes with a little keycap remover in the box,

04:07.920 --> 04:09.600
and it comes with a couple alternative keys

04:09.600 --> 04:11.840
that you might want to go with right away.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.840
It's got a USB hub on the back, some A and some C.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.400
It works on Linux.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.160
It works on Windows, and it works on Mac OS.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.040
The keyboard is 100% open source.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.720
The hardware design and the software that runs on it

04:23.720 --> 04:24.880
is all open source.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.640
So of course, those right there check a lot of boxes.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.560
For me, I've also recently gotten a little more

04:30.560 --> 04:33.240
into mechanical keyboards, thanks to the bad,

04:33.240 --> 04:36.680
I'd say, the bad influence for my co-host Mike on Koda Radio.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.000
I've gotten a little more into them.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.680
Let's just say it appears in the studio

04:39.680 --> 04:42.640
that keyboards breed something like bunnies.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.560
Or tribbles, in my case.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.240
Yeah.

04:45.240 --> 04:48.280
So I got it out of the box, and it immediately

04:48.280 --> 04:50.920
had a very solid feel to it.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.000
It looks deceivingly simple, but when you pick it up,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.760
there's a lot of heft in a way that feels like quality.

04:55.760 --> 04:59.080
The Royal keys are not quite as quiet as I expected.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.560
That was my first impression when I started typing.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.680
So maybe I should have just gone with the jades.

05:03.680 --> 05:08.240
And it's set, by default, to a rotating space backlight theme,

05:08.240 --> 05:09.800
which I like.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.440
It circles through different colors

05:11.440 --> 05:13.960
that you maybe would call, like, galaxy colors, I guess.

05:13.960 --> 05:17.800
So I just kept it the default. But job one for me,

05:17.800 --> 05:21.000
when I got this thing, was rearrange the Control, Alt,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.200
and Super, and Function key layout.

05:23.200 --> 05:29.200
By default, System76 ships it with Control key, Alt, Fn, Super.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.440
And that's fine, but not how I like it, you know?

05:32.440 --> 05:34.280
I like it more traditional.

05:34.280 --> 05:38.120
So I quickly just swapped it to Control, Fn, Super, Alt,

05:38.120 --> 05:42.200
swapped the keycaps, and then I went and grabbed their software

05:42.200 --> 05:43.240
to configure the keyboard.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.880
And I was curious what this experience was going to be like,

05:45.880 --> 05:46.880
because I'm not on Pop!

05:46.880 --> 05:51.640
OS, and I'm on Fedora, which is not even a Debian-based device.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.760
Which is not even a Debian-based distro.

05:53.760 --> 05:57.240
And so I'm like, am I going to be able to grab this, or what?

05:57.240 --> 06:00.160
So I go over to their page, download it off their GitHub,

06:00.160 --> 06:01.880
and it's an app image.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.800
So you mark that sucker executable,

06:03.800 --> 06:05.200
and you double-click on it.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.080
It asks for your root password, because it's

06:07.080 --> 06:08.120
going to scan your bus.

06:08.120 --> 06:12.080
And then it comes up, and it gives you

06:12.080 --> 06:13.800
a really clever layout.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.680
It's a visualization of the keyboard, which works really

06:16.680 --> 06:18.640
well for how my brain works.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.120
And it makes it simple to click this, or hold this,

06:21.120 --> 06:23.160
and map this function.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.400
And within a couple of minutes, I

06:25.400 --> 06:29.600
was mapping multiple keys to a single key press.

06:29.600 --> 06:31.320
And I like that a lot.

06:31.320 --> 06:34.320
Additionally, this thing supports four layers

06:34.320 --> 06:35.320
of customizable keys.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.960
In other words, you can essentially

06:36.960 --> 06:39.720
have four different layouts in this one keyboard,

06:39.720 --> 06:43.000
and you can toggle through them with different key combinations.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.040
I have my right Fn key set to switch to layer two,

06:46.040 --> 06:49.840
which is the default. But one of the things I've done in layer

06:49.840 --> 06:52.680
two is where I have some of my combos.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.480
I've set a different backlighting scheme

06:54.480 --> 06:55.920
for layer two.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.760
And you can do this with each layer.

06:57.760 --> 07:00.280
You can do options like only light up

07:00.280 --> 07:02.600
the keys that have a function assigned to them.

07:02.600 --> 07:06.840
So when I hold down layer two, only half a dozen keys

07:06.840 --> 07:07.440
light up.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.680
And those are just the ones I've mapped something to.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.840
And the rest all stay off.

07:11.840 --> 07:15.040
Layer three switches to a vertical scan pattern

07:15.040 --> 07:16.400
of LED lights.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.480
So I know I'm on layer three, because the keyboard lights

07:19.480 --> 07:20.520
switch pattern.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.320
And then when I release, it goes back to the layer one

07:23.320 --> 07:24.680
pattern of lights.

07:24.680 --> 07:28.560
That simple little thing was the trick

07:28.560 --> 07:31.080
I needed to keep all of this straight.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.680
I was worried that I would get lost

07:32.680 --> 07:34.720
in a sea of customization with this thing.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.040
And I would not be able to map in my brain what's

07:37.040 --> 07:38.920
on what layer, et cetera.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.560
But being able to control the LED lights and colors

07:41.560 --> 07:44.000
and patterns, or just do the single lightups for ones

07:44.000 --> 07:46.600
that have function, gave me the visual trick

07:46.600 --> 07:48.640
I needed combined with their software configurator

07:48.640 --> 07:50.720
that gives you a visual on-screen layout of what

07:50.720 --> 07:53.440
you're doing with a representation of the keyboard

07:53.440 --> 07:54.720
up on screen.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.000
It really actually clicked.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.680
And I've been able to keep with it.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.520
So the software really gives you a sense of how far you can

08:00.520 --> 08:01.680
actually take this keyboard.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.320
I mean, you can read the specs on their website.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.160
But when you plug it in and then you open up the software,

08:07.160 --> 08:09.880
it redefines what customizable is.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.200
This thing is truly next level.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.040
And then the beautiful thing is everything

08:13.040 --> 08:15.920
is then saved back to the keyboard immediately.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.240
So as soon as I change it, it's applied to the keyboard.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.760
I can unplug it from this computer.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.840
And I can go plug it into an entirely separate machine,

08:21.840 --> 08:23.040
a different operating system.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.000
It doesn't have any of the firmware or any keyboard

08:26.000 --> 08:27.280
software on it.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.000
And it will still all work because it's

08:29.000 --> 08:31.280
saved locally on the keyboard.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.880
That is huge for me because I don't

08:32.880 --> 08:35.280
want to have to load the software on every single machine

08:35.280 --> 08:37.040
that I want to use this thing on.

08:37.040 --> 08:41.960
And it also is showed right up in the GNOME firmware

08:41.960 --> 08:43.920
tool that uses LVFS.

08:43.920 --> 08:46.560
So it's completely supported by LVFS for updates.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.680
And I like seeing that.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.400
And somehow, you haven't even mentioned

08:49.400 --> 08:52.400
that their customization tool is powered by Rust.

08:52.400 --> 08:52.920
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:52.920 --> 08:53.800
What was that, Wes?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.840
It was powered by Rust.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

09:04.080 --> 09:07.200
And I wasn't really 100% sure, despite all of that,

09:07.200 --> 09:11.440
if it was really worth $285 because that seems

09:11.440 --> 09:13.160
like a lot of money for a keyboard.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.020
So what I did is I went to Amazon

09:16.020 --> 09:18.480
and I looked at some of their best, highest rated

09:18.480 --> 09:20.160
mechanical keyboards.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.200
And I went for the cheapest mechanical keyboard

09:22.200 --> 09:22.800
I could find.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.240
And I found one for $35.

09:25.240 --> 09:29.000
So I thought, let's see how this $35 keyboard stacks up

09:29.000 --> 09:32.640
against the $285 System76 keyboard.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.120
And there's obvious things, like this one sort of

09:35.120 --> 09:38.320
has a more muted sound.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.000
It doesn't quite feel quite as good.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.460
I mean, that's not a huge surprise.

09:41.460 --> 09:43.200
It's also plasticky and light.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.480
In fact, it even flexes a little bit when I twist it,

09:46.480 --> 09:50.920
where I could win a knife fight with the launch as a weapon.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.000
It's very solid.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.680
And those things were kind of like, OK,

09:55.680 --> 09:57.880
I went into a $30 keyboard expecting that.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.100
That's not really where I'm going to judge this on.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.520
I put them down side by side.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.040
And Wes was here on Sunday and we

10:03.040 --> 10:04.760
were doing Linux action news.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.800
And I didn't even prompt Wes.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.040
I didn't say anything to Wes.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.800
You brought it up to me.

10:09.800 --> 10:13.480
You said, you're typing faster than I've ever seen you type

10:13.480 --> 10:14.360
on the launch.

10:14.360 --> 10:15.520
That I did.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.840
I mean, you seemed kind of naturally at home.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.540
Admittedly, you had a different mechanical keyboard

10:20.540 --> 10:23.560
currently in use at the studio for a while, which didn't

10:23.560 --> 10:25.840
seem to be jiving with you.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.840
But it was clear that this was a new keyboard

10:28.840 --> 10:30.040
you were going to keep using.

10:30.040 --> 10:31.640
Yeah, so that other keyboard we tried

10:31.640 --> 10:35.640
that I hadn't here for a while was the Keytron K3.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.960
And I really wanted to like it because it was a good size.

10:38.960 --> 10:42.880
That was one that Keytron's a little bit smaller

10:42.880 --> 10:44.360
than the $35 Amazon one.

10:44.360 --> 10:47.080
The $35 Amazon one's a little wider.

10:47.080 --> 10:51.280
But the Keytron and the launch are about the same desk size.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.680
They're about the same size.

10:52.680 --> 10:56.140
And I can type significantly faster on the launch.

10:56.140 --> 10:58.320
And I think it is the layout a bit.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.020
It is also the way the keys feel.

11:00.020 --> 11:02.480
I think all of those, I think it's like three or four things

11:02.480 --> 11:04.920
about the design of the keyboard that come together

11:04.920 --> 11:06.960
to make it actually really fast.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.160
But I noticed it too.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.440
Even though I hadn't said anything to you about it,

11:10.440 --> 11:12.240
that weekend, I used the keyboard

11:12.240 --> 11:14.960
to write all of the notes for Linux Action News.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.760
And I was flying.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.760
I was like really enjoying the typing experience.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.560
And I know that sounds kind of cliche.

11:22.560 --> 11:25.880
But that matters a lot to me because I'm

11:25.880 --> 11:29.120
touching this damn thing every day, all damn day.

11:29.120 --> 11:34.000
And it matters to me that I smile when I look down at it.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
And it matters to me that it feels good

11:36.000 --> 11:37.160
every time I press on it.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.920
That's what you're paying for, right?

11:38.920 --> 11:42.040
If it works and with the durability

11:42.040 --> 11:44.280
that it looks like this thing has,

11:44.280 --> 11:47.240
it could be your keyboard for the next decade.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.280
There's absolutely no question about it.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.320
It's USB-C with its customizability.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.440
I will use this keyboard forever.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.960
It's going to last a very long time.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.840
And keyboards do for me in general.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.680
If it was $185 or $200, I would have already

12:00.680 --> 12:01.960
ordered another one.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.200
I absolutely would.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.360
At $285, it's kind of a special treat.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.440
And so it's going to be what we use in the studio.

12:07.440 --> 12:09.160
That feels kind of appropriate because it's

12:09.160 --> 12:10.680
kind of a specialty item.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.480
And then that plays a role for me too, right?

12:12.480 --> 12:14.920
This feels a bit like a bespoke item.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.240
It feels like something that my friends hand-built in Denver,

12:18.240 --> 12:20.800
you know, like people that are part of my community

12:20.800 --> 12:22.000
hand-built something.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.560
And I can buy it from them.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.160
And that's special too.

12:25.160 --> 12:28.720
And that's also the reason why I bought the Librem 15,

12:28.720 --> 12:32.400
because it also had that unique kind of collector

12:32.400 --> 12:34.000
almost feel to it.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.400
And that's why I bought the Atari VCS as well,

12:36.400 --> 12:38.000
even though I haven't received that one.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.120
Because again, it's kind of a unique item

12:40.120 --> 12:43.320
that comes from somebody that is working in the Linux community.

12:43.320 --> 12:47.120
And this launch encompasses that even so much more.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.720
I mean, they've been around now for well over 10 years now.

12:50.720 --> 12:53.520
But this represents a new milestone

12:53.520 --> 12:56.600
and a first for their business and a first for a Linux vendor.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.480
And so I wanted to have it for that reason too.

12:58.480 --> 13:02.560
And I mention that because those thoughts are invoked

13:02.560 --> 13:03.760
every time I look down at it.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.960
And that makes me happy as well.

13:05.960 --> 13:09.120
And so for me, it is worth the $285.

13:09.120 --> 13:13.640
And the $35 keyboard and the Keytron, which is $85,

13:13.640 --> 13:14.840
are all good keyboards.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.240
But they have things that are frustrating about them,

13:17.240 --> 13:20.680
where the launch really doesn't have any compromises.

13:20.680 --> 13:21.880
I didn't want a numpad.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.640
I know for some people that is an issue.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.240
But for me, this keyboard doesn't really

13:25.240 --> 13:27.720
have the compromises that those other two have.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.360
And a lot of times, when you get to the higher end gear,

13:30.360 --> 13:33.560
and Wes and I talked about this over the weekend, when

13:33.560 --> 13:36.120
it comes to our microphones, you start

13:36.120 --> 13:40.000
to get to the $500, $600, $1,000 microphones,

13:40.000 --> 13:42.920
they don't sound $500 better than a $200 microphone.

13:42.920 --> 13:46.200
They don't sound $1,000 better than a $100 microphone.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.680
They sound $50, $80 better, to be realistic about it.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.480
The drop off is kind of dramatic when

13:52.480 --> 13:54.720
it comes into high end professional audio gear.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.840
Some of that is true when it comes to high end computer

13:56.840 --> 13:57.320
gear.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.640
I don't think that drop off is as dramatic here

13:59.640 --> 14:00.640
with the keyboard.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.920
But when I look at this $85 Keytron,

14:02.920 --> 14:05.040
this launches another $200.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.880
Is it $200 better?

14:06.880 --> 14:07.800
I can't say.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.480
But I can say it is much better.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.280
I don't know if it's $200, but that's just

14:11.280 --> 14:13.680
going to be a personal value call each person makes.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.240
I, however, am very happy with it.

14:15.240 --> 14:18.600
And we'll spend a very long time using the keyboard.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.720
And I think in four or five years,

14:20.720 --> 14:23.120
I'm not even going to be thinking about the $285 price.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.160
I'm just going to be thinking about how

14:24.160 --> 14:25.680
great this keyboard still is.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.040
And I imagine it will remain my favorite keyboard

14:28.040 --> 14:31.240
for a long time until I get another one.

14:31.240 --> 14:34.280
There's also the aspect here that because it's open source,

14:34.280 --> 14:36.000
all of the openness about it, you

14:36.000 --> 14:38.560
can be a little less worried that support's going to drop

14:38.560 --> 14:41.940
or somehow System76, god forbid, goes out of business

14:41.940 --> 14:43.560
and you can no longer update or there's

14:43.560 --> 14:45.800
no more updates to their configuration utility

14:45.800 --> 14:48.880
or they somehow don't host the proprietary EXE download

14:48.880 --> 14:49.840
anymore.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.400
Seems like you can put your faith that A, this thing's

14:52.400 --> 14:54.240
going to be around as long as you need it,

14:54.240 --> 14:57.240
and B, I mean, you're helping System76 out

14:57.240 --> 14:58.400
by giving them some cash.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.280
And maybe there'll be some future keyboards

15:00.280 --> 15:01.360
that are even nicer.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.480
I talked to my buddy Mike in Coder Radio

15:03.480 --> 15:05.480
this week about his experiences using it.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.760
He tested it on a Mac, and it works there, too.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.520
Spoiler alert.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.360
So that's pretty impressive, the fact

15:10.360 --> 15:14.720
that I got it working on a Neon install and a Fedora box,

15:14.720 --> 15:17.600
and he has it working on a Mac.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.400
And it seems to be fully functional there as well.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.940
And it's really easy to swap the keys around to your liking

15:22.940 --> 15:24.280
and then just go map them in the software.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.940
And they're making the software available

15:25.940 --> 15:27.560
for Windows and the Mac, too.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.000
And all these things just kind of come together

15:29.000 --> 15:31.040
to make it feel like it's a bit of a new milestone

15:31.040 --> 15:32.040
for System76.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.540
I mean, think about what they had to do to build this thing

15:34.540 --> 15:35.800
and actually ship it to customers

15:35.800 --> 15:37.040
from just like a project management

15:37.040 --> 15:38.640
standpoint and a process development

15:38.640 --> 15:40.280
standpoint for a business, right?

15:40.280 --> 15:42.000
And then you think about where this leads.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.520
Now that they've, this is their first shot.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.920
And I'm sitting here telling you, I really like it.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.220
It could have been junk.

15:48.220 --> 15:50.240
It could have been crappy to type on.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.560
It's not like they've built a lot of keyboards before.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.120
So if they took something like this

15:56.120 --> 16:00.080
and they put this something like this in a laptop,

16:00.080 --> 16:01.660
that was like something they moved on to,

16:01.660 --> 16:05.260
is building a laptop that just runs Linux

16:05.260 --> 16:07.080
and has a keyboard like this on it,

16:07.080 --> 16:09.160
I think that'd be an extremely compelling project.

16:09.160 --> 16:13.600
And this is obviously the first step on a much longer journey.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.840
And checking in on goalpost one, they nailed it.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.840
And I think that's really the takeaway here, is wherever

16:20.840 --> 16:23.720
they end up taking this, if this is step one,

16:23.720 --> 16:25.080
well, they nailed step one.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.400
So the way I look at this, when you first

16:27.400 --> 16:31.160
mentioned this keyboard, I had a similar reaction of how much?

16:31.160 --> 16:32.400
This is way too much.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.960
There's no way anybody's going to spend $285 on a keyboard.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.480
But then I started thinking about the equivalent

16:39.480 --> 16:40.920
in different industries.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.460
Cars is a perfect example.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.720
I have a premium version of a Golf

16:45.720 --> 16:50.600
sat on my driveway, a very average economy car that's

16:50.600 --> 16:54.160
had a bigger engine and whatever put into it.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.880
I don't need that bigger engine.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.120
I don't need the four-wheel drive system.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.600
But yet, I'm happy to pay extra because it gives me

17:00.600 --> 17:02.120
those feels when I get into it.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.960
I look down and I see the fact that it

17:03.960 --> 17:06.880
has the flappy paddles on the steering wheel.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.840
And I think to myself, yeah, this is nice.

17:08.840 --> 17:09.800
This makes me feel good.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.840
And if you're getting that same feeling from the keyboard,

17:12.840 --> 17:17.560
something that you touch and see all day, every day for half

17:17.560 --> 17:21.120
a decade, maybe longer, sure, I think it's worth it, don't you?

17:21.120 --> 17:22.560
That is my math on it.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.080
I know for some, though, I think maybe for Neil,

17:25.080 --> 17:27.280
if it's not full-sized, it doesn't really work for you,

17:27.280 --> 17:27.800
does it?

17:27.800 --> 17:31.520
Yeah, I actually use my number pad quite a lot.

17:31.520 --> 17:35.520
And I mean, I can obviously get away with it

17:35.520 --> 17:37.680
without having it because my laptops don't have it.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.880
I actually hate having the number pad on the laptops

17:39.880 --> 17:41.320
because it makes them cramped.

17:41.320 --> 17:42.760
But when I'm working on a desktop

17:42.760 --> 17:44.640
and I'm going to have an external keyboard,

17:44.640 --> 17:47.360
I really want a full-sized one because I take advantage

17:47.360 --> 17:48.120
of the real estate.

17:48.120 --> 17:51.760
And I like the more space in the keys

17:51.760 --> 17:53.320
and a lot more even layout.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.720
That said, I'm super excited about this.

17:55.720 --> 17:59.400
And if they had a regular version of it with a full layout

17:59.400 --> 18:01.000
and even maybe some multimedia keys

18:01.000 --> 18:05.840
and some extra little quality of life additions,

18:05.840 --> 18:07.040
I'd be down for it.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.200
Maybe they will have multiple.

18:08.200 --> 18:08.880
I've wondered.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.720
Or like a volume knob that some of those fancy keyboards have.

18:11.720 --> 18:12.560
I'd take that.

18:12.560 --> 18:13.040
Yeah.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.040
I love the volume.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.080
I do, too.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.200
It's my volume knob.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.440
And so legit, I use my media keys a lot.

18:20.440 --> 18:25.000
I have the volume control, the play, pause, back, forward,

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
and the mute button.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.520
The mute button gets hit a lot.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.440
I use those.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.440
And so having those on a keyboard is important for me.

18:32.440 --> 18:33.160
Right.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.400
I am very, very, very fond of compact keyboards

18:36.400 --> 18:40.080
here in the studio and in my recording setup

18:40.080 --> 18:42.240
in my mobile setup in Lady Jupiter.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.480
But at my desk, I agree with you there.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.840
I like a full-sized keyboard.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.840
And I think maybe that's one of the reasons I'm not

18:47.840 --> 18:50.160
putting the launch at my office desk.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.400
I'm putting it here in the studio.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.480
And then also because it's a bit of a conversation

18:53.480 --> 18:55.160
piece in the studio as well.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.760
But yeah, that's very true.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.320
And I would love to see one day multiple versions

18:59.320 --> 19:00.440
of the launch.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.480
That could be pretty cool.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.240
What would you have on your keyboard, Wes,

19:03.240 --> 19:04.920
on your custom launch keyboard?

19:04.920 --> 19:05.440
Oh, yeah.

19:05.440 --> 19:05.920
OK.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.280
Well, I definitely want the volume knob and then

19:08.280 --> 19:11.720
as many possible LEDs as they could pack.

19:11.720 --> 19:15.880
And Pipe Dream here, what about something like a System76

19:15.880 --> 19:18.520
Pure Open Source Powered Touch Bar?

19:18.520 --> 19:21.680
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.040
Well, first, in the housekeeping,

19:23.040 --> 19:25.840
I wanted to let you know that our buddies across the pond

19:25.840 --> 19:28.840
have a bit of a party this Saturday.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.880
Foss Talk Live starts at 7 PM their local time

19:31.880 --> 19:33.040
on their YouTube channel.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.720
You can go over there and get subscribed,

19:34.720 --> 19:37.000
and then that will just go live.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
So we are recording this on June 8.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.520
So it is the Saturday we're recording,

19:41.520 --> 19:44.480
which is June 12, 2021, Foss Talk Live,

19:44.480 --> 19:47.040
7 PM their local time.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.720
And it's a crossover event, too.

19:48.720 --> 19:49.920
So Wes and I will have it up.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.280
We'll have the popcorn going, and we'll

19:51.280 --> 19:53.040
be cracking jokes at our friends' expense.

19:53.040 --> 19:54.280
It should be a good time.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.920
Oh, you know it.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.280
Also, we'd love to hear from you.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.680
Some ideas that we have on this show, some of the segments,

20:00.680 --> 20:03.480
like today's episode, are inspired by our audience.

20:03.480 --> 20:07.000
We get emails into the show, and then we pursue an answer.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.440
So we'd love to get your questions, your feedback, all

20:09.440 --> 20:12.640
of it, at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.140
Of course, there is a whole network,

20:14.140 --> 20:17.280
and the conversation is always rolling in our Telegram channel.

20:17.280 --> 20:20.400
You can join that at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash

20:20.400 --> 20:24.440
Telegram, and the conversation goes 24-7,

20:24.440 --> 20:26.160
and many of us are popping in and out there

20:26.160 --> 20:26.880
throughout the day.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.120
Linode.com slash unplugged.

20:33.120 --> 20:36.240
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days on your new account.

20:36.240 --> 20:37.640
And of course, you support the show,

20:37.640 --> 20:40.760
make it possible for us to release free content.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.360
Linode is our hosting provider of choice.

20:42.360 --> 20:43.280
You guys know that.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.980
But I was reflecting on one of the things

20:44.980 --> 20:48.360
that I really appreciate about Linode while I was traveling.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.920
And as you can probably guess, that

20:49.920 --> 20:52.340
was making it possible for us to keep services up,

20:52.340 --> 20:55.080
even though I was mostly AFK.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.520
So I'm traveling, and of course, as you would expect,

20:57.520 --> 20:58.560
I get an alert.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.920
That alert tells me that network traffic has gone crazy

21:00.920 --> 21:02.040
on one of our boxes.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.400
But the great thing about Linode,

21:03.400 --> 21:05.440
and honestly, yeah, I could do this myself.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.200
In fact, some of our Linodes, we do have our own software

21:08.200 --> 21:09.120
and alerting on there.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.080
And yeah, I can set up monitoring and alerting.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.920
But it's table stakes with Linode.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.000
That's the great thing, is there's a baseline.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.600
And getting alerts on things like excessive network traffic

21:18.600 --> 21:21.440
is almost always a tell that something is wrong on a box.

21:21.440 --> 21:23.440
I mean, maybe you're just having a great day.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.240
You know, that's good to know too, actually.

21:25.240 --> 21:29.240
That's kind of like, yeah, hell yeah, we're doing great.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.600
But no, not in this case.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.160
But the thing that is really slick

21:33.160 --> 21:34.560
is it's easy to work with a team.

21:34.560 --> 21:38.560
And so Wes got the alert and was able to get logged in and fix

21:38.560 --> 21:40.320
the issue before I even read the email.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.960
He gave me a status update.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.240
And I just sat there thinking to myself, man,

21:44.240 --> 21:46.520
am I really grateful that these kinds of basics

21:46.520 --> 21:49.520
are taken care of and that I pop into the dashboard,

21:49.520 --> 21:52.360
I can see the history, I can see what's going on.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.800
And even if you're not a pro, the cloud dashboard

21:54.800 --> 21:56.560
Linode has built is so straightforward

21:56.560 --> 21:59.880
that you're going to get access to this information right away.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.760
And they kind of just abstract away

22:01.760 --> 22:04.520
the fact that you get 11 data centers to choose from that

22:04.520 --> 22:07.000
have crazy fast connections between them

22:07.000 --> 22:10.240
and that you have everything from these $5 a month

22:10.240 --> 22:13.520
rigs, which it's amazing how many things you

22:13.520 --> 22:16.960
can run on one of those, to systems with AMD

22:16.960 --> 22:20.280
epic processors that just crush all of the competition,

22:20.280 --> 22:23.760
like the full range is in there, while still being 30% to 50%

22:23.760 --> 22:28.280
cheaper than big cloud that has these complicated, horrible

22:28.280 --> 22:32.080
UIs, often with some sort of funky secondary business

22:32.080 --> 22:35.200
model behind them, where Linode, they're truly independent.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.400
In fact, they are the largest independent cloud provider.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.520
And I love that about them.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.200
They've been around since 2003.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.640
The Linode infrastructure is solid.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.560
You can focus on your project and not

22:45.560 --> 22:47.840
having to build and manage all of that stuff.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.200
And you get alerts when something goes sideways, too.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.200
And that's pretty great.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.640
So head over to linode.com slash unplug.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.480
Get that $100 credit for your new account

22:55.480 --> 22:56.680
and try this stuff out.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.600
Go build something, learn something, maybe deliver

22:59.600 --> 23:00.600
something online.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.160
There's a lot of ways to host things.

23:02.160 --> 23:03.840
There's a lot of companies that offer

23:03.840 --> 23:07.440
a lot of different options at crazy different price points.

23:07.440 --> 23:10.000
But none of them, none of them are Linode.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.520
None of them bring it all together.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.000
None of them are the largest independent cloud provider.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.280
And none of them have been involved in the Linux community

23:16.280 --> 23:18.280
as long as Linode, because they've been doing it

23:18.280 --> 23:19.400
before everybody else.

23:19.400 --> 23:22.160
So go get $100 and support the show.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.760
Linode.com slash unplugged.

23:24.760 --> 23:32.000
Dries from Belgium wrote in, I'm a long-term Mac user

23:32.000 --> 23:35.880
dipping my toes in Linux with a second-hand ThinkPad running

23:35.880 --> 23:39.000
Pop OS, that sounds like a nice setup.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.120
I also have an iPhone and a Canon M50.

23:43.120 --> 23:46.720
I'm wondering what photo managing solution

23:46.720 --> 23:48.440
do you all recommend?

23:48.440 --> 23:50.160
I think privacy is very important.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.440
I want to add right here.

23:51.440 --> 23:54.960
And I'd also like a local copy, as well as, ideally,

23:54.960 --> 23:56.640
a cloud backup.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.400
I've also got a Raspberry Pi laying around,

23:58.400 --> 24:01.880
which I could use if I was going to self-host something.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.320
What are your photo managing and backup workflows?

24:04.320 --> 24:06.120
Local, cloud, both?

24:06.120 --> 24:09.240
Uh-oh, I have to admit something on the episode now.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.720
Right here, I got to say, I have slipped back

24:11.720 --> 24:15.320
into using Google Photos as my backup backup.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.800
You kind of have that second backup.

24:16.800 --> 24:20.240
And truthfully, I have found part of the reason

24:20.240 --> 24:23.280
that I've been drawn back to it is the front-end client

24:23.280 --> 24:26.440
features of being able to search for objects like dog

24:26.440 --> 24:30.480
and Christmas tree or pictures of my son in Idaho

24:30.480 --> 24:32.640
has just drawn me back to using Google Photos,

24:32.640 --> 24:35.320
because the front-end makes it easy to find photos

24:35.320 --> 24:38.040
that I can then pull and send to a family member really quick.

24:38.040 --> 24:41.920
And that practical functionality brought me back.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.600
And so I use, on my phone, the Google Photo backup app

24:45.600 --> 24:47.080
to send my photos off site.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.880
Yeah, I have to admit, I'm in the same boat.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.560
I used to have a sort of custom sync thing solution going,

24:51.560 --> 24:53.320
which worked pretty well.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.280
But honestly, the network effect kind of pulled me back

24:56.280 --> 24:57.120
into Google Photos.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.720
I mean, one, I had bought a Pixel,

24:58.720 --> 25:01.320
and so it was kind of opted in anyway.

25:01.320 --> 25:03.680
And then I went on some vacations.

25:03.680 --> 25:04.720
This was a few years ago.

25:04.720 --> 25:06.760
But my friends, they were on there too.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.600
They were starting an album.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.360
I had to upload some things to Google Photos regardless.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.520
And once I was there, it was just so easy to stay.

25:14.520 --> 25:15.720
That's the trick.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.120
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.960
So the problem actually is, we're

25:18.960 --> 25:21.720
going to admit, Google Photos is a good product.

25:21.720 --> 25:25.120
But recently, Google has made change to the pricing structure

25:25.120 --> 25:27.080
and taken away some of the incentives that they

25:27.080 --> 25:29.760
used to actually get us using it in the first place.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.840
And with any kind of Google thing,

25:31.840 --> 25:34.560
it's kind of like, how long is this going to be around?

25:34.560 --> 25:36.080
Is this really a long-term solution?

25:36.080 --> 25:37.760
And what about the privacy aspects of it

25:37.760 --> 25:39.400
and the ongoing cost?

25:39.400 --> 25:41.040
And I don't know, do you agree, Alex?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.720
Is part of the problem Google Photos is just kind of, well,

25:43.720 --> 25:44.880
it's damn good.

25:44.880 --> 25:45.800
I do, absolutely.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.080
Yes, hello, everybody.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.760
They've done the old bait and switch there, haven't they?

25:49.760 --> 25:51.280
The first hit is free.

25:51.280 --> 25:52.120
Exactly.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.080
They drew me in.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.520
And then because I was already paying for Google Storage

25:55.520 --> 25:59.720
for my backups, it wasn't like this, oh no, now I have to pay.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.200
It was like, oh, well, I'm already paying,

26:02.200 --> 26:03.840
so I guess I can just keep using it.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.360
Now, for those that aren't familiar,

26:05.360 --> 26:09.520
what's actually changing is that as of June 1, 2021,

26:09.520 --> 26:12.440
the account storage is shared across Drive, Gmail,

26:12.440 --> 26:13.120
and Photos.

26:13.120 --> 26:16.280
But any new photos and videos you upload

26:16.280 --> 26:19.840
will now count towards the free 15 gigabytes of storage that

26:19.840 --> 26:22.560
comes with every Google account.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.880
Now, the reason that's changed is

26:23.880 --> 26:26.960
before they had this kind of compressed high quality

26:26.960 --> 26:30.360
in air quotes that didn't count towards that quota,

26:30.360 --> 26:32.400
but now everything does, no matter what.

26:32.400 --> 26:33.320
Yeah.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.760
And I wasn't using all 10 terabytes,

26:35.760 --> 26:37.520
so it wasn't a huge hit to me.

26:37.520 --> 26:40.000
But it woke me up and reminded me

26:40.000 --> 26:43.560
how precarious the situation is when I'm using a hosted service

26:43.560 --> 26:47.120
like this, and how they always, so far, Alex,

26:47.120 --> 26:48.720
have inevitably bit me in the butt,

26:48.720 --> 26:51.320
and a lot of times have done so in such a way that

26:51.320 --> 26:53.160
inspired us to start the self-hosted podcast.

26:53.160 --> 26:55.600
So that, I know, is well-covered ground for us.

26:55.600 --> 26:59.440
But yet, here I am, knowing better,

26:59.440 --> 27:02.480
knowing the privacy implications of Google, all of that.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.320
The transparent background uploads,

27:05.320 --> 27:07.400
the sharing features that Wes touched on,

27:07.400 --> 27:10.680
and then the searching features are very good.

27:10.680 --> 27:13.160
And you could make the argument that now that Google

27:13.160 --> 27:15.400
is making you pay for this, it actually

27:15.400 --> 27:17.040
makes Google Photos sustainable.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.800
So it'll be around for a long time.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.200
So I think it remains a very viable option.

27:21.200 --> 27:24.800
But I know I should be probably looking into other things.

27:24.800 --> 27:27.920
Well, when we look at the whole picture here,

27:27.920 --> 27:31.440
you've got to take into consideration who owns the data,

27:31.440 --> 27:33.640
what are they going to do with it, how much is it

27:33.640 --> 27:36.400
going to cost, not just in terms of it's

27:36.400 --> 27:39.200
going to cost me a couple of dollars every month,

27:39.200 --> 27:42.880
but in terms of the cost to humanity,

27:42.880 --> 27:47.680
I suppose, in not having a fully open solution.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.480
And what I've come to find writing this piece

27:50.480 --> 27:53.120
is that there isn't one size fits

27:53.120 --> 27:55.680
all self-hosted photo management solution.

27:55.680 --> 27:58.440
There are several very good options,

27:58.440 --> 28:00.440
but all of them check different boxes

28:00.440 --> 28:03.960
and miss other really basic stuff.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.520
Libre Photos, for example, is one of the apps

28:06.520 --> 28:08.440
we'll come on to later.

28:08.440 --> 28:11.400
It doesn't let you delete a photo from an album.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.320
It just boggles my mind that such a basic thing

28:13.320 --> 28:16.720
gets missed from some of this stuff.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.280
But the other angle of self-hosting

28:19.280 --> 28:21.800
is that you have to have a server.

28:21.800 --> 28:25.280
You have to pay either Linode, or build one

28:25.280 --> 28:28.200
and stick it in your basement, or a closet, or whatever it is.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.800
And so there's a cost not only in terms of financial stuff

28:31.800 --> 28:35.320
upfront for self-hosting, but also in terms of my time

28:35.320 --> 28:38.200
to research and set these things up as well.

28:38.200 --> 28:41.640
And if Google Photos ends up being around for 10, 15 years,

28:41.640 --> 28:43.840
is it likely that you're going to build and self-host

28:43.840 --> 28:46.080
something that will also be around for 10 or 15 years?

28:46.080 --> 28:47.320
That's what I was thinking.

28:47.320 --> 28:49.080
I'm OK running some of my infrastructure,

28:49.080 --> 28:51.680
but photos are some things I'd like to not lose.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.240
And if I make a mistake, as a novice admin, say.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.560
I always find it useful, whenever

28:55.560 --> 28:57.320
we talk in such large timescales,

28:57.320 --> 29:02.040
to just remind you, 10 years ago was 2011.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.320
What were you doing then with your photos?

29:04.320 --> 29:07.120
Just picture how far the industry's come in that decade

29:07.120 --> 29:09.840
and think about how far it might go in the next.

29:09.840 --> 29:13.400
It seems like what really is the killer next generation

29:13.400 --> 29:18.560
feature is object recognition, face recognition, location

29:18.560 --> 29:20.720
recognition, and then an interface that

29:20.720 --> 29:22.760
allows you to manage all of that.

29:22.760 --> 29:26.000
And that's what Google nailed early with Google Photos.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.480
It isn't necessarily impossible to get in something

29:28.480 --> 29:29.880
you could run yourself.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.240
And I know you've looked at several of them.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.200
Well, if I was reviewing Google Photos,

29:34.200 --> 29:36.400
one of the things I would probably put in the negative

29:36.400 --> 29:39.440
column is that it doesn't have an awful lot in the way

29:39.440 --> 29:41.000
of organizational features.

29:41.000 --> 29:45.760
It has basic album support, and that's pretty much it.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.560
Compare that to a lot of the other options

29:47.560 --> 29:49.360
that we'll talk about today.

29:49.360 --> 29:53.720
And Google managed to sidestep a lot of that

29:53.720 --> 29:56.400
by having awesome machine learning.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.800
And when you have an interface that is literally,

29:58.800 --> 30:00.880
like you said in the beginning, search

30:00.880 --> 30:04.360
for photos of Dylan in Idaho, you

30:04.360 --> 30:07.240
don't need a directory structure that organizes everything.

30:07.240 --> 30:10.640
You don't need to spend hours tagging things.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.720
Their algorithms have done all that work for you.

30:13.720 --> 30:17.160
And machine learning, it's a bit of a buzzword in the industry,

30:17.160 --> 30:20.360
but if we think about it in its simplest form,

30:20.360 --> 30:21.800
it's just pattern matching.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.680
So all the algorithms are looking

30:23.680 --> 30:26.520
for are certain groupings of pixels

30:26.520 --> 30:28.520
that it think, well, maybe that's a tree.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.400
Maybe that's a face.

30:29.400 --> 30:30.480
Maybe that's a monkey.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.360
Or a hot dog.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.360
Or a hot dog, yes.

30:32.360 --> 30:35.240
Have you seen that Silicon Valley episode?

30:35.240 --> 30:38.120
And machine learning really is everywhere these days.

30:38.120 --> 30:41.800
And I was watching, I think it was a Marques Brownlee video,

30:41.800 --> 30:46.600
MKBHD on YouTube, talking about how farmers

30:46.600 --> 30:51.080
are using machine learning to identify weeds in their crops

30:51.080 --> 30:53.560
so that they use 90% less pesticides.

30:53.560 --> 30:54.280
So interesting.

30:54.280 --> 30:57.600
There are some significant use cases for machine learning

30:57.600 --> 30:59.240
outside of photos.

30:59.240 --> 31:01.920
But of course, where it gets interesting is it reduces

31:01.920 --> 31:04.440
your overhead of organization.

31:04.440 --> 31:05.920
Right, because you don't have to go through and tag,

31:05.920 --> 31:06.960
this is a Dylan picture.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.040
This is a Chris picture.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.520
This is an Idaho picture.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.080
It just does all that for you and then

31:11.080 --> 31:12.960
makes it available as search criteria.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.040
Absolutely.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.680
Now, when we're thinking about this space,

31:16.680 --> 31:19.800
we've got to think about the workflow.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.920
And I think we've got Brent on the line as well.

31:21.920 --> 31:23.080
And as a professional photographer,

31:23.080 --> 31:25.480
I'm sure he can add something into the conversation

31:25.480 --> 31:26.840
about workflows.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.800
But what I'm primarily looking to back up here

31:29.800 --> 31:32.760
are the images I take on my smartphone.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.640
I do take a lot of images with my SLR when I'm traveling.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.800
But for most of the rest of the time,

31:37.800 --> 31:40.280
I will dump those at the end of a trip.

31:40.280 --> 31:43.280
And it's two weeks worth of images, bang.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.920
And I'm done.

31:44.920 --> 31:47.840
What I'm more interested in is that kind of daily minutia

31:47.840 --> 31:50.120
kind of automation and getting those images

31:50.120 --> 31:53.920
off my mobile device in a never compressed format.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.280
Now, I use Nextcloud to do this.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.240
What do you use?

31:56.240 --> 31:58.600
Actually, Alex, I'm using Nextcloud as well.

31:58.600 --> 32:01.400
And in the beginning, it was a little clumsy.

32:01.400 --> 32:05.200
But these days, I'm finding it just very seamless.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.560
Is that your experience as well?

32:06.560 --> 32:07.280
It just works.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.080
Yeah, and that's the best kind of works.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.920
Does it run automatically in the background?

32:10.920 --> 32:13.440
Yeah, it has this nice feature where

32:13.440 --> 32:14.800
it's just called auto upload.

32:14.800 --> 32:18.480
And you can add any folder that detects media on your phone.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.680
So it could be even just like downloads and things like that,

32:21.680 --> 32:24.760
not just the photos from your camera, which

32:24.760 --> 32:28.320
I found really helpful to back up things like backups

32:28.320 --> 32:31.880
of my signal database that happens automatically,

32:31.880 --> 32:32.640
things like that.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.120
Oh, that's a good idea.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.240
There you go.

32:35.240 --> 32:36.880
But for photographs, it's great.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.980
Because as a professional photographer,

32:38.980 --> 32:41.720
I have this sort of constant fear

32:41.720 --> 32:46.200
of losing any photographs that's been baked into my mind

32:46.200 --> 32:47.960
for a really long time.

32:47.960 --> 32:51.480
And so I call it the sort of run over by a dump truck situation.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.560
If your phone gets run over by a dump truck

32:53.560 --> 32:56.120
while you're out on some experience

32:56.120 --> 32:58.800
that you want to remember forever,

32:58.800 --> 33:01.240
well, it uploads your photos as you take them.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.440
And I think that's a really nice feature.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.000
And Nextcloud has been really seamless doing that.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.240
So in terms of at least that auto backup feature,

33:10.240 --> 33:12.760
it's really solid, really, really solid,

33:12.760 --> 33:16.240
not to mention solving a bunch of other neat things for us

33:16.240 --> 33:17.240
outside of photos.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.600
So there's several ways to get the photos off the phone.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.400
Like Alex and I recently talked about FolderSync,

33:22.400 --> 33:25.320
which is another Android application that does this.

33:25.320 --> 33:28.400
Of course, I guess the obvious other one would be Dropbox.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.440
They offer to do this.

33:29.440 --> 33:29.940
Indeed.

33:29.940 --> 33:32.640
And they'll get it on a file system for you, right?

33:32.640 --> 33:34.400
So it seems like there are several ways

33:34.400 --> 33:37.600
to solve that with various pluses and minuses.

33:37.600 --> 33:40.720
But that's not really what my problem isn't getting

33:40.720 --> 33:42.000
the photo off the device.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.760
I don't even mind like you, Alex.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.840
I'll sit down after a trip, and I'll dump the photos off

33:46.840 --> 33:48.480
of the SD card for the drone.

33:48.480 --> 33:49.600
I'll manually do that.

33:49.600 --> 33:50.860
There's nothing automated about that.

33:50.860 --> 33:52.400
But there's kind of a ritual about it.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.840
And I'm pretty good about doing that one thing.

33:54.840 --> 33:56.080
That I got down.

33:56.080 --> 33:58.880
It is honestly, it's the organization.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.040
I guess I don't want to say I'm lazy.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.680
Young Chris kept everything in folders on his file system

34:04.680 --> 34:08.160
and managed his music and his pictures that way and loved it.

34:08.160 --> 34:10.440
And it was a system that really worked for him.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.800
But now President Chris looks back at that guy

34:12.800 --> 34:14.480
and goes, boy, what a waste of my time.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.480
I'm not doing that.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.840
But yet, I consider these photos extremely important.

34:18.840 --> 34:21.720
It's this weird dichotomy that I find myself in.

34:21.720 --> 34:23.960
And so it's not so much the uploading of the photos.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.280
It is the managing of the photos.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.160
And I'm trying to find something that

34:28.160 --> 34:31.680
isn't a proprietary system, that isn't locked to Apple or Google.

34:31.680 --> 34:33.960
It's really easy to do that kind of organization

34:33.960 --> 34:36.240
when you have a trip to aim at.

34:36.240 --> 34:39.960
You know, 2015 road trip, Southwest USA, for example.

34:39.960 --> 34:42.520
Or like family reunion 2021.

34:42.520 --> 34:43.120
Uh-huh.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.600
But if it's just a random Tuesday

34:44.600 --> 34:46.680
where you've snapped to your kid being cute,

34:46.680 --> 34:49.640
it's a bit harder to get that into some kind of folder

34:49.640 --> 34:51.240
other than misc, right?

34:51.240 --> 34:52.880
Yeah, or just even spend the time

34:52.880 --> 34:55.280
to do it in the daily flow like that.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.400
And one of those things that slips, right?

34:56.400 --> 34:57.800
Maybe you try to do it on Sundays,

34:57.800 --> 34:59.840
but then something came up and someone came over

34:59.840 --> 35:01.560
and then you missed it.

35:01.560 --> 35:04.120
How important do we think open source

35:04.120 --> 35:07.000
versus closed source is in this space?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.160
Boy, that's tough.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.000
That's tough.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.080
That is tricky because I often consider

35:12.080 --> 35:15.440
the essential applications to be the most important

35:15.440 --> 35:17.200
open source free software applications.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.160
Like that's generally my default.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.440
But I'm worried, to be honest with you, Alex,

35:22.440 --> 35:23.840
that the machine learning stuff

35:23.840 --> 35:25.760
or whatever GPU acceleration stuff

35:25.760 --> 35:27.440
that's going to be necessary to get what I want

35:27.440 --> 35:28.960
is all going to be proprietary.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.200
Well, good news there.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.840
Most of the apps that we'll talk about today

35:31.840 --> 35:32.920
use TensorFlow,

35:32.920 --> 35:35.600
which is a Google machine learning algorithm.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.440
There's another one that we'll talk about

35:37.440 --> 35:40.360
called PhotoStruxure, which has a closed source

35:40.360 --> 35:42.600
and it's also a paid product as well.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.120
But the developer has committed,

35:44.120 --> 35:46.640
if anything happens to him or his company,

35:46.640 --> 35:47.920
to open source the product.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.640
Does that count for you?

35:49.640 --> 35:51.440
It's definitely a plus anyway.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.360
I mean, I'm not,

35:52.360 --> 35:54.200
I guess I can handle proprietary software,

35:54.200 --> 35:56.560
but I'd like to understand some of the motivations

35:56.560 --> 35:58.440
and think that there's something long-term

35:58.440 --> 36:00.120
that I can depend on at the very least.

36:00.120 --> 36:02.560
I mean, there's clear advantages to an open source project

36:02.560 --> 36:04.680
if it has a sizable user base

36:04.680 --> 36:06.760
and a sustainable development model.

36:06.760 --> 36:09.920
You get visibility into the direction of the project

36:09.920 --> 36:13.280
and photos is a pretty important possession.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.840
And so having that kind of forward-looking guidance

36:15.840 --> 36:18.480
on a project gives me peace of mind.

36:18.480 --> 36:21.920
But we talked about Beersmith in episode 400.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.560
That's a proprietary application,

36:23.560 --> 36:26.200
but it is built by a developer

36:26.200 --> 36:27.800
who's dedicating his life to that.

36:27.800 --> 36:30.880
And it's got a good user base and he's not going away.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.520
Or, I mean, we're recording this right now in Reaper,

36:33.520 --> 36:35.040
which is also a proprietary application,

36:35.040 --> 36:37.480
but one that we love and absolutely depend on.

36:37.480 --> 36:40.680
Yeah, so if the tool's clever enough

36:40.680 --> 36:43.920
and it looks sustainable, I'd consider it.

36:43.920 --> 36:44.760
It's the age-old question

36:44.760 --> 36:46.400
of how do you monetize open source?

36:46.400 --> 36:47.240
Right.

36:47.240 --> 36:50.040
I think it's a problem that will bother us

36:50.040 --> 36:51.240
for many years yet.

36:51.240 --> 36:54.320
Well, and Alex, it's also pragmatism versus idealism.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.240
It's that question too.

36:55.240 --> 36:56.440
And you're coming to something

36:56.440 --> 36:59.040
like your precious life photos.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.640
And you're like in this war of like,

37:00.640 --> 37:03.240
well, do I want something that's only free software?

37:03.240 --> 37:04.520
Or am I willing to settle?

37:04.520 --> 37:06.120
And it's like, where do you fall

37:06.120 --> 37:08.360
on that whole pragmatism versus idealism line?

37:08.360 --> 37:10.240
Well, I think if you're going full pragmatist,

37:10.240 --> 37:12.160
you'll just use Google Photos, right?

37:12.160 --> 37:14.760
Yeah, and I think that's what's been gnawing

37:14.760 --> 37:17.240
at both Wes and I is full pragmatist

37:17.240 --> 37:19.640
also means you're fully vulnerable

37:19.640 --> 37:22.080
to whatever that service provider does.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.680
And that's uncomfortable.

37:23.680 --> 37:26.080
We were looking a little bit before the show

37:26.080 --> 37:28.400
and playing around with Google Photos sync

37:28.400 --> 37:31.240
like a Python daemon that'll sync stuff down from Google.

37:31.240 --> 37:33.600
So I wonder if there's maybe some happy mediums there

37:33.600 --> 37:35.080
where you still might want a backup.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.320
Maybe you even want sort of a read-only view

37:37.320 --> 37:39.520
of a local web interface of those backed up files,

37:39.520 --> 37:42.200
but you use Google Photos for sharing with family.

37:42.200 --> 37:44.320
Right, and so you have local copies

37:44.320 --> 37:46.040
and then you have the copies on Google Photos.

37:46.040 --> 37:46.880
Or maybe it goes the other way

37:46.880 --> 37:47.720
and you sync it locally

37:47.720 --> 37:49.760
and then upload them to Google Photos on the site.

37:49.760 --> 37:50.600
I'm not sure.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.680
It seems like there's a lot of options though.

37:51.680 --> 37:53.720
Or maybe something else entirely.

37:53.720 --> 37:57.000
You could argue, right, that Google Photos

37:57.000 --> 38:01.160
being a completely proprietary service is irrelevant

38:01.160 --> 38:03.000
as long as the export tools are good enough.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.440
And Google love to promote this Google Takeout tool.

38:06.440 --> 38:07.920
But when I was writing this piece,

38:07.920 --> 38:09.720
you know, it's taken me a week or so.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.320
On the first night I was writing,

38:11.320 --> 38:12.800
I went to Google Takeout

38:12.800 --> 38:15.520
and pressed the give me my photos button.

38:15.520 --> 38:18.240
We are about eight or nine days now

38:18.240 --> 38:20.800
and I still haven't gotten the download link.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.000
Really? Wow.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.560
That doesn't give you confidence.

38:23.560 --> 38:24.400
Not really.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.240
Although I have to say,

38:25.240 --> 38:27.160
I think if Google Photos was gonna shut down,

38:27.160 --> 38:30.480
they would probably give people a pretty good grace period

38:30.480 --> 38:31.560
to get their data out of there.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.080
I don't think Google will just turn it off.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.480
I think what is actually more likely, Alex,

38:36.480 --> 38:38.600
is that something happens to my Google account

38:38.600 --> 38:41.640
and I lose access to my Google account, thus my photos.

38:41.640 --> 38:42.520
Now I know that Brent,

38:42.520 --> 38:44.920
you have a fully open sourced workflow.

38:44.920 --> 38:47.280
So you must have some opinions on this, right?

38:47.280 --> 38:49.280
Well, I started tackling this problem

38:49.280 --> 38:51.480
much before we had mobile phones.

38:51.480 --> 38:56.480
And so I will say my solutions are a bit archaic,

38:56.680 --> 38:57.880
but they are solid.

38:57.880 --> 38:59.680
Stay a while and listen.

38:59.680 --> 39:04.240
And so one thing, one criteria I had

39:04.240 --> 39:06.480
that's still very strong for me

39:06.480 --> 39:11.360
is to always have the ability to put my photos

39:11.360 --> 39:15.200
somewhere on a file system without dependency on anything.

39:15.200 --> 39:20.200
So anything includes a company, a web service, a database,

39:20.960 --> 39:24.000
if I can have access to them always,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.200
then that's really super important.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.240
And so Chris, when you said,

39:27.240 --> 39:30.800
oh, if I lose access to my Google account,

39:30.800 --> 39:33.600
I started cringing and my palms are sweating

39:33.600 --> 39:35.760
and that makes me super uncomfortable

39:35.760 --> 39:38.560
because that's something I've seen happen a lot

39:38.560 --> 39:40.600
to very well-meaning people.

39:40.600 --> 39:42.400
And I've tried to help people get in

39:42.400 --> 39:44.400
and sometimes it's impossible.

39:44.400 --> 39:47.120
And so actually that's even worse

39:47.120 --> 39:49.480
than having your phone run over by a dump truck

39:49.480 --> 39:53.240
because it's all of the photos spanning across

39:53.240 --> 39:55.600
several generations of phones that you've had

39:55.600 --> 39:58.800
and not to mention other things you've uploaded there.

39:58.800 --> 40:02.520
So I think having that in mind,

40:02.520 --> 40:05.360
being able to export your photos meaningfully,

40:05.360 --> 40:08.240
which Alex, it sounds like they failed there for you,

40:08.240 --> 40:09.400
that's extremely important.

40:09.400 --> 40:12.240
So for me, that's the top one

40:12.240 --> 40:15.720
and that's the one that's kept me from using Google Photos

40:15.720 --> 40:20.480
all these years is that it just makes me really uncomfortable.

40:20.480 --> 40:23.200
And so some of the tools I've relied on

40:23.200 --> 40:26.800
have been a little bit more offline tools for that reason.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.400
And like I said, I've developed my pipeline

40:31.320 --> 40:32.800
to have longevity to it.

40:32.800 --> 40:35.240
And so it's worked up till this point.

40:35.240 --> 40:37.800
Cause you're even allergic to stuff like Lightroom, right?

40:37.800 --> 40:40.720
You really don't wanna even go as far as paying Adobe any,

40:40.720 --> 40:42.120
I don't know, what's the word I'm looking for?

40:42.120 --> 40:43.800
You don't wanna give Adobe credit

40:43.800 --> 40:47.560
for going to a subscription model or whatever it is.

40:47.560 --> 40:50.240
You use a dark table if I'm not mistaken, right?

40:50.240 --> 40:51.160
I do, yeah.

40:51.160 --> 40:54.240
And you know, Alex, you touch on a little piece

40:54.240 --> 40:56.120
of my past there.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.800
So Lightroom was sort of the defacto

40:58.800 --> 41:00.120
and where I learned doing a lot

41:00.120 --> 41:03.920
of really efficient photo manipulation.

41:03.920 --> 41:07.560
And I got bit by early versions of Lightroom

41:07.560 --> 41:10.440
because their libraries weren't compatible

41:10.440 --> 41:14.640
between different versions sometimes depending,

41:14.640 --> 41:16.360
but also they would get corrupted.

41:16.360 --> 41:21.360
And so that was where both this desire

41:21.840 --> 41:23.560
to get away from a dependency

41:23.560 --> 41:25.440
on some of those functions came from,

41:25.440 --> 41:28.800
but also where I got introduced to open software

41:28.800 --> 41:31.560
in the first place, to open source software.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.800
And so it's funny that you mentioned Lightroom

41:33.800 --> 41:37.120
because it's the reason that I have these philosophies now

41:37.120 --> 41:38.520
and that I looked for alternatives

41:38.520 --> 41:43.400
that didn't tie all my metadata into, you know,

41:43.400 --> 41:46.400
a neat little database that could get corrupted or lost.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.480
I think it's better these days,

41:47.480 --> 41:52.360
but back then it just sort of informed my decisions.

41:52.360 --> 41:53.920
So all right, Alex, give us a rundown

41:53.920 --> 41:55.840
of some of the apps you've come across.

41:55.840 --> 41:58.000
One of the first apps I picked out was Photonics.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.160
Now this one, its headline feature

42:00.160 --> 42:03.080
is machine learning object detection.

42:03.080 --> 42:05.320
There's currently no face detection with this one,

42:05.320 --> 42:07.920
but there is active development in this area.

42:07.920 --> 42:11.360
And I ended up really liking this app for a while.

42:11.360 --> 42:14.640
And then the more I used it, the more I disliked it.

42:14.640 --> 42:17.040
I just found the interface kind of really cluttered.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.200
Now, the way I like to describe this

42:19.200 --> 42:21.560
is kind of designed by developer.

42:21.560 --> 42:23.160
It's one of those interfaces

42:23.160 --> 42:26.480
where clearly the people working on the project

42:26.480 --> 42:28.120
know every little bell and whistle,

42:28.120 --> 42:29.680
every little knob and dial to turn,

42:29.680 --> 42:32.320
but as a user coming to it fresh,

42:32.320 --> 42:36.160
I don't need to be presented with everything all at once.

42:36.160 --> 42:37.720
With a photo app in particular,

42:37.720 --> 42:40.040
the content should be front and center

42:40.040 --> 42:43.840
and then everything else should be available if I want it.

42:43.840 --> 42:48.040
There is a demo of Photonics at demo.photonics.org.

42:48.040 --> 42:50.440
Now the next one was actually a really interesting project.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.480
So it used to be called OwnPhotos

42:52.480 --> 42:56.280
and recently it was forked into the new project

42:56.280 --> 42:58.680
called LibrePhotos.

42:58.680 --> 43:01.120
This was probably,

43:01.120 --> 43:03.560
it was certainly in my top three of the apps I looked at.

43:03.560 --> 43:05.200
And there's a lot to like here.

43:05.200 --> 43:08.160
It's got all the important stuff like face recognition,

43:08.160 --> 43:10.760
geo lookups, object detection,

43:10.760 --> 43:13.560
and the developer recently added video support as well.

43:13.560 --> 43:16.480
And having just had a kid,

43:16.480 --> 43:20.120
I have totally changed my tune on video.

43:20.120 --> 43:22.520
Yeah, take as much video as you can, that's my advice.

43:22.520 --> 43:24.480
And particularly if it displays,

43:24.480 --> 43:26.160
just like Google Photos does,

43:26.160 --> 43:28.680
in the feed, in the timeline view,

43:28.680 --> 43:30.840
just like a photo would do.

43:30.840 --> 43:34.400
Also, and this one Brent might be of interest for you,

43:34.400 --> 43:38.080
it has a direct integration with Nextcloud via WebDAV,

43:38.080 --> 43:40.240
which enables a seamless import of images

43:40.240 --> 43:42.240
between those two applications.

43:42.240 --> 43:45.800
See, I like that because it starts to combine

43:45.800 --> 43:48.840
some applications to solve the whole solution space

43:48.840 --> 43:51.000
that Google Photos is offering,

43:51.000 --> 43:52.280
where it seems like so far,

43:52.280 --> 43:54.560
some of these are little bits and pieces.

43:54.560 --> 43:56.120
Is that what I'm getting?

43:56.120 --> 43:58.640
Right, whereas this is a sync and the photo library.

43:58.640 --> 44:00.600
And I like, I also like in here,

44:00.600 --> 44:02.600
they have a data visualization section

44:02.600 --> 44:06.400
that shows you timeline and word clouds and places tree.

44:06.400 --> 44:07.240
Oh, wow.

44:07.240 --> 44:08.080
That stuff's fun.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.720
Actually really do like the timeline stuff

44:09.720 --> 44:11.600
because I can go through there and look at,

44:11.600 --> 44:13.120
just discover a whole time period.

44:13.120 --> 44:15.480
And then pretty soon I'm starting to send pictures

44:15.480 --> 44:17.120
to my wife, oh, remember this?

44:17.120 --> 44:19.040
All of that kind of little thing,

44:19.040 --> 44:20.880
things that just kind of built into Google Photos

44:20.880 --> 44:21.720
and other software.

44:21.720 --> 44:23.960
It's nice to see that here in Libre photos.

44:23.960 --> 44:24.800
That's cool.

44:24.800 --> 44:27.000
Those data visualizations are cool,

44:27.000 --> 44:30.200
but ultimately, particularly the word cloud,

44:30.200 --> 44:32.320
I found it just to be a bit pointless.

44:32.320 --> 44:35.760
Like maybe if in the word cloud that's generated,

44:35.760 --> 44:38.280
so what happens is Libre photos will go through

44:38.280 --> 44:40.720
and scan your images and tag it

44:40.720 --> 44:42.840
with all the different objects it's found,

44:42.840 --> 44:44.360
you know, tree, monkey, dog.

44:44.360 --> 44:45.200
Hot dog.

44:45.200 --> 44:46.040
Hot dog.

44:46.040 --> 44:48.800
And it will generate a word cloud.

44:48.800 --> 44:52.120
And obviously the more times it finds the same word,

44:52.120 --> 44:54.040
the bigger the word becomes in the word cloud, right?

44:54.040 --> 44:56.120
Just like you'd expect.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.280
What I would expect when that happens

44:58.280 --> 45:00.280
is that I would then be able to click on that word

45:00.280 --> 45:01.440
in the web interface.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.720
And it would take me to that category of images.

45:03.720 --> 45:04.560
Yeah.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.680
Unfortunately, it doesn't do that right now.

45:06.680 --> 45:09.800
Ooh, you gotta be kidding.

45:09.800 --> 45:10.640
What's the point?

45:10.640 --> 45:11.480
That's no good.

45:13.000 --> 45:13.840
It's a small thing.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.280
But again, it's just another example

45:15.280 --> 45:17.240
of how it's designed by a developer

45:17.240 --> 45:19.200
as opposed to someone who's more focused

45:19.200 --> 45:21.560
perhaps on the user experience.

45:21.560 --> 45:22.440
Yeah, okay.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.280
All right.

45:23.280 --> 45:26.160
So Libre photos could be a contender,

45:26.160 --> 45:28.040
especially if you're in the next cloud space,

45:28.040 --> 45:30.480
but I have a sense there's something else out there.

45:30.480 --> 45:31.320
Honestly, man.

45:31.320 --> 45:33.160
There are so many.

45:33.160 --> 45:34.440
There are so many.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.440
I started off trying to write

45:36.440 --> 45:38.200
a couple of thousand word article.

45:38.200 --> 45:41.880
And over a week later, I'm tearing my hair out thinking,

45:41.880 --> 45:44.360
oh, there's so many options.

45:44.360 --> 45:45.880
So if I miss your favorite option,

45:45.880 --> 45:47.560
or we don't talk about it today,

45:47.560 --> 45:49.240
please, it's not a slight against you.

45:49.240 --> 45:53.800
Just let us know, linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

45:53.800 --> 45:54.640
All right.

45:54.640 --> 45:57.200
So the next one I'm gonna talk about is photo structure.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.760
Now this is the one that's got the really interesting

45:59.760 --> 46:02.960
kind of open source dilemma going on.

46:02.960 --> 46:06.560
So the application itself is closed source.

46:06.560 --> 46:08.800
There are several features that the developer

46:08.800 --> 46:11.600
has open sourced and upstreamed

46:11.600 --> 46:13.160
to various different projects.

46:13.160 --> 46:15.760
So it's kind of a, it's closed source,

46:15.760 --> 46:18.240
but it's aware of the open source ecosystem.

46:18.240 --> 46:20.080
So it's not on Adobe.

46:20.080 --> 46:22.640
It's not like an Oracle kind of level

46:22.640 --> 46:25.360
of closed source evilness,

46:25.360 --> 46:28.960
but it's also not full on freedom hippie open source either.

46:28.960 --> 46:30.520
Somewhere in the middle, interesting.

46:30.520 --> 46:32.320
Yeah, bear that in mind.

46:32.320 --> 46:33.800
The killer features of this app

46:33.800 --> 46:36.160
are based around photo organization.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.920
So Chris, this might be one for you.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.440
There are zero machine learning features, unfortunately,

46:40.440 --> 46:43.080
but what this one really excels at

46:43.080 --> 46:46.080
is image ingestion and management.

46:46.080 --> 46:49.000
So if you point this at a directory,

46:49.000 --> 46:51.840
it will support either existing file systems,

46:51.840 --> 46:54.760
or it will ingest and import images

46:54.760 --> 46:58.040
into its own file structure, which is still readable.

46:58.040 --> 46:59.280
It's not a database.

46:59.280 --> 47:02.520
It's just a bunch of files organized properly.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.640
It will also de-duplicate images

47:04.640 --> 47:08.800
and run on any major OS as a kind of a web app,

47:08.800 --> 47:11.200
but as a service, if that makes sense.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.560
So I run everything in a container

47:13.560 --> 47:14.960
that we're talking about here.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.120
And if you're saying that's the way you'll go to,

47:17.120 --> 47:20.680
but this one runs on any major OS that you'd like.

47:20.680 --> 47:21.520
Oh, okay.

47:21.520 --> 47:23.400
And it says it's been designed to handle

47:23.400 --> 47:26.280
a lifetime of photos and videos.

47:26.280 --> 47:27.440
Like all the best software,

47:27.440 --> 47:30.160
this one scratches an itch for the developer.

47:30.160 --> 47:32.480
And so it is closed source, but you can self-host it.

47:32.480 --> 47:34.280
You can run it on your own system.

47:34.280 --> 47:36.040
So it's a sustainable project, right?

47:36.040 --> 47:38.520
The developer can eat, and I think that's important.

47:38.520 --> 47:40.560
A lot of these projects are kind of

47:40.560 --> 47:42.840
one or two man operations,

47:42.840 --> 47:45.640
and PhotoStruxure is a one man operation,

47:45.640 --> 47:47.240
but it's his full-time job,

47:47.240 --> 47:49.560
and he can pay the bills and his mortgage with it.

47:49.560 --> 47:52.960
So he's motivated to keep working on it and add new features.

47:52.960 --> 47:55.800
And as a paid customer for PhotoStruxure,

47:55.800 --> 47:58.520
you get the ability to vote on the next features

47:58.520 --> 48:01.080
coming along and it's a meritocracy.

48:01.080 --> 48:03.400
So obviously the features with the most votes

48:03.400 --> 48:04.800
are the ones that he will work on

48:04.800 --> 48:07.640
because the people paying the bills have asked him to do so.

48:07.640 --> 48:08.480
I like that.

48:08.480 --> 48:11.160
Always nice to see software that runs and targets Linux

48:11.160 --> 48:12.880
and they've mentioned Docker right there

48:12.880 --> 48:14.600
pretty prominently, wonderful.

48:14.600 --> 48:15.440
I can live with that.

48:15.440 --> 48:17.920
All right, so PhotoStruxure looks like a serious contender,

48:17.920 --> 48:19.880
as long as I don't want the machine learning

48:19.880 --> 48:21.440
like base tagging stuff.

48:21.440 --> 48:22.600
Yeah, that is a shame.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.720
And I think obviously with time,

48:24.720 --> 48:26.920
those features will get added to it.

48:26.920 --> 48:30.080
But the thing I picked up most talking to Matthew

48:30.080 --> 48:34.960
was just how much care and attention and craftsmanship

48:34.960 --> 48:37.960
has gone into the backend of what's already there.

48:37.960 --> 48:39.600
By far and away, it's the most performant

48:39.600 --> 48:41.920
of any of the products that we're talking about today

48:41.920 --> 48:43.840
or any of the projects we're talking about.

48:43.840 --> 48:46.920
And I think the project has a bright future.

48:46.920 --> 48:49.320
Nice one, that had not been on my radar before.

48:50.200 --> 48:51.400
What else do we got?

48:51.400 --> 48:54.400
Well, we're moving into the kind of gallery apps,

48:54.400 --> 48:55.520
actually, no, before we do,

48:55.520 --> 48:57.520
I'll just talk about PhotoPrism.

48:57.520 --> 48:59.200
This one is open source,

48:59.200 --> 49:02.040
and there's a link to the demo in the show notes.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.560
Much like Libre Photos and Photonics,

49:04.560 --> 49:09.160
it also uses Google TensorFlow to do machine learning.

49:09.160 --> 49:12.360
It can automatically classify objects,

49:12.360 --> 49:14.920
but as of today, there's no face detection.

49:14.920 --> 49:16.640
Okay, now like our emailer,

49:16.640 --> 49:18.320
he only had a Raspberry Pi 3,

49:18.320 --> 49:20.520
so I don't think he can do TensorFlow.

49:20.520 --> 49:22.880
And what kind of requirements do I need?

49:22.880 --> 49:25.440
Do I need to have a Nvidia Tesla GPU

49:25.440 --> 49:27.040
to be able to use TensorFlow?

49:27.040 --> 49:28.720
I mean, you certainly could.

49:28.720 --> 49:31.680
You could use CUDA, I think is the Nvidia library

49:31.680 --> 49:33.680
that does that kind of stuff.

49:33.680 --> 49:38.280
But I'm just running this on an i5 eighth gen CPU.

49:38.280 --> 49:39.480
So it's only got six cores.

49:39.480 --> 49:43.320
It's not a super powerhouse or anything.

49:43.320 --> 49:44.840
Maybe it is compared to a Raspberry Pi,

49:44.840 --> 49:47.360
but it's not a data center.

49:47.360 --> 49:49.000
All right, that sounds pretty reasonable.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.160
So PhotoPrism uses TensorFlow to do all of that.

49:52.160 --> 49:53.600
And it also gives you a gallery

49:53.600 --> 49:55.200
to sort through all of that.

49:55.200 --> 49:56.800
I would imagine exposing the metadata

49:56.800 --> 49:57.640
and all that kind of stuff.

49:57.640 --> 49:59.120
I remember the UI.

49:59.120 --> 50:00.600
I remember checking it out for self-hosted,

50:00.600 --> 50:02.040
and it felt like it was really clean

50:02.040 --> 50:03.840
and simple and straightforward.

50:03.840 --> 50:06.200
I actually end up growing to hate it this week.

50:06.200 --> 50:08.600
Again, it's a design by developer problem.

50:08.600 --> 50:11.240
So if you look at the interface that I've got here,

50:11.240 --> 50:13.760
it's got eight pictures of airplanes.

50:13.760 --> 50:15.600
Actually, some of those were taken at the studio,

50:15.600 --> 50:17.240
by the way, do you remember when there was those planes

50:17.240 --> 50:18.400
flying around at the sprint?

50:18.400 --> 50:19.240
Yeah.

50:19.240 --> 50:20.600
A couple of those are from then.

50:20.600 --> 50:22.680
If you look at the pictures,

50:22.680 --> 50:25.040
if you click on an image, what would you expect to happen?

50:25.040 --> 50:26.520
I would expect the image to open.

50:26.520 --> 50:28.120
Nope, wrong, guess again.

50:28.120 --> 50:30.240
Oh no, what happens?

50:30.240 --> 50:32.360
What happens here is it begins

50:32.360 --> 50:34.360
a multi-image selection process.

50:34.360 --> 50:35.200
No.

50:35.200 --> 50:36.120
That's unacceptable.

50:36.120 --> 50:38.600
To open the image, you have to click on the tiny,

50:38.600 --> 50:42.000
tiny little translucent camera icon up in the top left.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.560
Yeah, that does seem kind of like a really simple thing,

50:44.560 --> 50:46.000
yet very frustrating thing.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.160
Which is also sometimes a magnifying glass

50:48.160 --> 50:49.280
with a plus in the middle of it.

50:49.280 --> 50:50.800
Right, right, right.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.440
And also sometimes a play button.

50:52.440 --> 50:54.080
And because it's a web app,

50:54.080 --> 50:55.480
God only knows what could be going on

50:55.480 --> 50:56.600
with your web browser at that moment,

50:56.600 --> 50:58.200
where the first click isn't even registered.

50:58.200 --> 51:00.960
Right, so there are little things with PhotoPrism

51:00.960 --> 51:02.760
that could use work, and again,

51:02.760 --> 51:05.920
it's mostly user interface and experience stuff.

51:05.920 --> 51:08.160
They do have really great documentation

51:08.160 --> 51:11.480
on a WebDAV feature, so much like Libre Photos,

51:11.480 --> 51:13.920
you can integrate this with Nextcloud,

51:13.920 --> 51:17.720
but also you can mount this via WebDAV

51:17.720 --> 51:19.600
from your desktop computer.

51:19.600 --> 51:21.480
So Brent, maybe this could be one for you.

51:21.480 --> 51:24.800
I'm thinking with DigiCam or Darktable or something.

51:24.800 --> 51:26.240
Yeah, it does sound really interesting

51:26.240 --> 51:28.800
because it seems to blend the internet world

51:28.800 --> 51:31.160
with my here at home in my cave world.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.280
And here's what I'm trying to wrap my head around, Brent.

51:33.280 --> 51:35.080
So you take all these photos, you know,

51:35.080 --> 51:36.240
you got a whole, I would imagine,

51:36.240 --> 51:39.760
a nice library of faces and objects.

51:39.760 --> 51:41.960
Have you ever considered how nice it would be

51:41.960 --> 51:44.720
to be able to just expose like every picture

51:44.720 --> 51:46.320
of this particular face or person

51:46.320 --> 51:48.760
or every photo that has this plant in it?

51:48.760 --> 51:50.560
Like that seems like that would be extremely useful

51:50.560 --> 51:51.720
for a professional.

51:51.720 --> 51:55.800
It's a feature I've dreamt of for decades.

51:55.800 --> 51:58.960
And so I will say, I will admit to absolutely everyone

51:58.960 --> 52:01.240
that my methods are deprecated

52:01.240 --> 52:03.240
and only because they've worked

52:03.240 --> 52:06.200
and I haven't really needed a better way,

52:06.200 --> 52:08.680
although you guys are all making me realize

52:08.680 --> 52:10.440
that I'm suffering a little bit

52:10.440 --> 52:11.800
without some of these features.

52:11.800 --> 52:13.640
So I am all ears.

52:13.640 --> 52:15.080
Hey Alex, I'm thinking we do

52:15.080 --> 52:17.640
a total self-hosted makeover for the photos

52:17.640 --> 52:20.440
for Brent in a future episode of self-hosted, you know?

52:20.440 --> 52:21.280
It's an intervention.

52:21.280 --> 52:22.360
Yeah, we'll show up.

52:22.360 --> 52:24.280
We'll have like this whole server set up for you.

52:24.280 --> 52:25.520
We'll show you the whole workflow

52:25.520 --> 52:27.720
and get the Brent stamp of approval and then deploy it

52:27.720 --> 52:30.400
and get all of your images recognized.

52:30.400 --> 52:32.240
And it'll be a full photo makeover.

52:32.240 --> 52:34.640
I'll expect a link to the gallery of that event.

52:34.640 --> 52:39.800
Okay, so that's PhotoPrism and it is open source.

52:39.800 --> 52:41.960
So that checks a box, it supports web dev.

52:41.960 --> 52:43.920
So that makes it pretty flexible.

52:43.920 --> 52:45.160
Is there any other ones we should mention?

52:45.160 --> 52:46.400
Cause you know, look, I wanted to mention,

52:46.400 --> 52:48.240
I think it was at Leachy, we've used that before.

52:48.240 --> 52:50.640
I think we still have that somewhere running actually.

52:50.640 --> 52:52.960
We do gallery.selfhosted.show.

52:52.960 --> 52:56.000
There's a few of my own personal images in there.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.200
And this one's really interesting

52:57.200 --> 52:59.560
cause it kind of somewhat blurs the line

52:59.560 --> 53:02.520
between a straightforward gallery app

53:02.520 --> 53:04.360
and a photo management app.

53:04.360 --> 53:06.440
And the reason I say that is because

53:06.440 --> 53:09.480
you can organize images into albums,

53:09.480 --> 53:11.920
but you can also edit the metadata of these images.

53:11.920 --> 53:14.720
Now, a lot of these programs that we've talked about

53:14.720 --> 53:18.760
have next to no image editing features.

53:18.760 --> 53:21.240
We're talking not a single one on this list

53:21.240 --> 53:22.920
allows you to crop an image.

53:22.920 --> 53:24.960
A couple of them allow you to rotate,

53:24.960 --> 53:26.560
Leachy's one of those.

53:26.560 --> 53:29.880
But I mean, I can't crop an image in any of these.

53:29.880 --> 53:32.280
I was, I couldn't believe that.

53:32.280 --> 53:34.840
Yeah, I think I'm kind of coming to the conclusion

53:34.840 --> 53:37.160
that my strategy for that would be local editing.

53:37.160 --> 53:40.280
So something like Shotwell or Darktable for local edits,

53:40.280 --> 53:42.280
which I think that's what you're doing now, Wes.

53:42.280 --> 53:46.520
And so that's why the ones that support WebDAV

53:46.520 --> 53:47.560
are kind of appealing to me

53:47.560 --> 53:49.480
because I could see using both tools.

53:49.480 --> 53:53.160
One is a viewing and searching tool and discovery tool

53:53.160 --> 53:54.600
that I can, oh, look at this great pic.

53:54.600 --> 53:57.000
I can quickly copy it and paste it into Telegram, right?

53:57.000 --> 53:58.040
That's one tool.

53:58.040 --> 54:00.840
And then the other tool is that one

54:00.840 --> 54:02.160
where I've gone a little bit in

54:02.160 --> 54:04.440
and I maybe crop something to make it a nicer shot

54:04.440 --> 54:05.280
or something like that.

54:05.280 --> 54:07.160
And I can save it back to the same source location.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.840
During one of those editing sessions,

54:08.840 --> 54:09.800
maybe when you have the itch

54:09.800 --> 54:10.960
or you're getting back from a trip

54:10.960 --> 54:11.960
and you're kind of going through things.

54:11.960 --> 54:12.840
Right, right.

54:12.840 --> 54:14.160
What would be a really nice feature

54:14.160 --> 54:17.840
is if you could use some of these apps we're talking about

54:17.840 --> 54:21.280
as your sort of photo organization method

54:21.280 --> 54:25.360
and then have this, let me dream here for a moment,

54:25.360 --> 54:27.560
have this method to just sort of,

54:27.560 --> 54:28.960
I don't know, you can't right click in here,

54:28.960 --> 54:31.640
but right click and go open in Darktable

54:31.640 --> 54:33.640
or open in Glimpse or something like that

54:33.640 --> 54:35.840
and then do your cropping and your photo adjusting.

54:35.840 --> 54:39.160
And that way they don't have to sort of rely on that stuff.

54:39.160 --> 54:40.400
Yeah, I think you've just described

54:40.400 --> 54:41.440
the mobile experience now.

54:41.440 --> 54:42.960
Mm-hmm, exactly.

54:42.960 --> 54:45.600
Dang it.

54:45.600 --> 54:47.920
Well, and the reality is whenever you wanna share stuff

54:47.920 --> 54:50.680
with family, oftentimes you're on the go

54:50.680 --> 54:53.080
or you've got five minutes while you're waiting

54:53.080 --> 54:56.840
on somebody else to do something or in a lineup at the bank.

54:56.840 --> 54:58.440
I say the bank, who goes to the bank anymore?

54:58.440 --> 54:59.400
But you know what I mean?

54:59.400 --> 55:02.240
Hey, I went and deposited a check in person this week

55:02.240 --> 55:04.560
for the first time in a long time.

55:04.560 --> 55:05.400
Where did you go?

55:05.400 --> 55:07.400
Caveman, welcome back.

55:07.400 --> 55:10.760
But I found even for me, like I'm sharing most of my stuff

55:10.760 --> 55:15.440
from mobile, not to clients, but to everybody else.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.800
And so that's an essential feature.

55:17.800 --> 55:19.720
I'll tell you what Brent, sharing images via link

55:19.720 --> 55:23.080
is actually a surprisingly difficult thing to get right

55:23.080 --> 55:24.520
apparently in this space.

55:24.520 --> 55:26.440
Lychee does this best in my opinion.

55:26.440 --> 55:30.200
It allows you to generate different URLs for social media,

55:30.200 --> 55:32.240
but also, and this is a really cool feature,

55:32.240 --> 55:35.680
Lychee will let you generate images automatically scaled

55:35.680 --> 55:37.120
to certain resolutions.

55:37.120 --> 55:39.480
That's directly in its sharing pane.

55:39.480 --> 55:42.320
That's Lychee, L-Y-C-H-E-E.

55:42.320 --> 55:43.720
And if you wanna see an example of it,

55:43.720 --> 55:45.960
you can go to gallery.selfhosted.show.

55:45.960 --> 55:47.640
And it's pretty straightforward.

55:47.640 --> 55:49.960
Do you think maybe this is the most straightforward

55:49.960 --> 55:51.280
of all of them to get up and running

55:51.280 --> 55:53.120
and just share photos with somebody?

55:53.120 --> 55:56.320
Yeah, I think it's probably my favorite app overall

55:56.320 --> 55:58.040
in this entire rundown.

55:58.040 --> 56:00.560
The downside is it has no machine learning features.

56:00.560 --> 56:05.360
So if you want that kind of search organization,

56:05.360 --> 56:06.760
it doesn't have that.

56:06.760 --> 56:08.640
Like you say in your article,

56:08.640 --> 56:10.960
it's a great front end to whatever else you're using

56:10.960 --> 56:13.480
to make your photos look great and organize them well.

56:13.480 --> 56:14.720
That's where it shines.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.080
So I have a link to some of these projects

56:16.080 --> 56:17.200
that we've mentioned here on the show.

56:17.200 --> 56:19.000
So that way you don't have to worry about the weird names

56:19.000 --> 56:22.040
at linuxunplug.com slash 409.

56:22.040 --> 56:26.680
Now, if I could just do one final little honorable mention.

56:26.680 --> 56:29.560
I came across an app called File Run on Self Hosted

56:29.560 --> 56:31.120
a few months ago,

56:31.120 --> 56:34.440
and I actually ended up using it quite a bit for photos

56:34.440 --> 56:36.800
because it has a bunch of image processing stuff

56:36.800 --> 56:38.120
in the background.

56:38.120 --> 56:40.480
And all File Run does is it's a web app

56:40.480 --> 56:44.240
that presents an underlying file system in the web browser.

56:44.240 --> 56:47.560
And it supports full text and has metadata search as well,

56:47.560 --> 56:49.320
which if you think about it,

56:49.320 --> 56:51.760
apart from the machine learning stuff it's missing,

56:51.760 --> 56:53.360
is actually half the battle.

56:53.360 --> 56:55.120
So this is at filerun.com,

56:55.120 --> 56:57.300
and this would totally be one of our tools

56:57.300 --> 56:59.680
in the total photo makeover for Brent, Alex.

56:59.680 --> 57:02.760
And the UI is surprisingly nice.

57:02.760 --> 57:04.560
For something that I've wanted for so long,

57:04.560 --> 57:06.840
just your files available in mobile

57:06.840 --> 57:10.280
or in a full web version in a really nice UI.

57:10.280 --> 57:12.180
And, although I don't really think

57:12.180 --> 57:13.080
you probably use this much,

57:13.080 --> 57:16.160
but it has plugins too for things like Google Apps

57:16.160 --> 57:19.460
and Office 365 and Autodesk and a lot of those things.

57:19.460 --> 57:21.160
Autodesk, what?

57:21.160 --> 57:24.320
Yeah, so you can pull in CAD files, isn't that funny?

57:24.320 --> 57:25.280
Why not, man?

57:25.280 --> 57:27.540
And if all you have lying around is a Raspberry Pi,

57:27.540 --> 57:29.240
this might be the way to go.

57:29.240 --> 57:31.040
Yeah, throw File Run on there,

57:31.040 --> 57:33.040
do your file uploads right there,

57:33.040 --> 57:35.040
and then maybe leechy on top of that

57:35.040 --> 57:38.640
to do some of the display and sharing.

57:38.640 --> 57:39.960
That could be a nice way to go.

57:39.960 --> 57:42.880
Absolutely, and I think it just highlights clearly

57:42.880 --> 57:46.680
that none of these apps check all of these boxes.

57:46.680 --> 57:49.840
You're gonna have to have probably NextCloud

57:49.840 --> 57:51.680
to get the images off your device,

57:51.680 --> 57:54.920
and then something else to organize and edit them.

57:54.920 --> 57:56.520
Well, actually something else to organize them,

57:56.520 --> 57:57.980
something else to edit them,

57:57.980 --> 58:00.480
like a DigiCam or whatever it might be.

58:00.480 --> 58:02.680
And then something else maybe to display them as well.

58:02.680 --> 58:04.040
So very quickly you've got a stack

58:04.040 --> 58:06.000
of three or four apps here.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.440
And I ended up coming to the conclusion

58:08.440 --> 58:11.180
that unless some of these apps

58:11.180 --> 58:14.680
are able to kind of pool together their resources,

58:14.680 --> 58:18.980
we're not gonna see a true Google Photos alternative

58:18.980 --> 58:22.640
that ticks all the boxes for some time.

58:22.640 --> 58:24.760
Yeah, and then it just has to, I suppose,

58:24.760 --> 58:28.520
be that question of pragmatism versus idealism,

58:28.520 --> 58:32.440
and how much work are you willing to put in for your photos?

58:32.440 --> 58:35.840
Right, here you get to and have to build your own pipeline

58:35.840 --> 58:37.840
with Google Photos, they've done it for you,

58:37.840 --> 58:40.160
but you don't get any input on how it works.

58:40.160 --> 58:42.680
And maybe for something like your photos

58:42.680 --> 58:45.080
that you wanna have a 25-year grasp on

58:45.080 --> 58:46.840
or something like that at a time,

58:46.840 --> 58:49.760
maybe that's worth getting out the old, you know,

58:49.760 --> 58:53.880
artisan, craftsman kind of mindset and building something.

58:53.880 --> 58:55.000
I think it might be for me.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.160
I've always been teetering on this.

58:57.160 --> 58:58.920
And I also sometimes wonder if perhaps

58:58.920 --> 59:00.640
it isn't maybe the perfect sweet spot

59:00.640 --> 59:02.640
to build something locally that's like this,

59:02.640 --> 59:05.800
and maybe still loop in some service to do backups,

59:05.800 --> 59:07.960
because that's how important the photos are to me.

59:07.960 --> 59:10.520
Well, Google Photos, I think, is still an excellent choice

59:10.520 --> 59:11.680
for your offsite backup.

59:11.680 --> 59:15.720
If you're following the 3-2-1 principle for your backups,

59:15.720 --> 59:18.320
Google Photos is a fantastic choice.

59:18.320 --> 59:21.120
I should also mention at this point that Amazon,

59:21.120 --> 59:22.960
if you're a Prime subscriber,

59:22.960 --> 59:27.080
has free unlimited photo storage for now.

59:27.080 --> 59:29.240
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

59:29.240 --> 59:30.800
Yep, that's just it.

59:30.800 --> 59:33.080
And it may be in some weird, twisted way,

59:33.080 --> 59:35.520
Google's transition to actually making you pay

59:35.520 --> 59:37.920
for the storage that you use for Google Photos

59:37.920 --> 59:40.400
may actually be the thing that makes it sustainable

59:40.400 --> 59:41.880
and stick around for a long time.

59:41.880 --> 59:44.800
And maybe that is in some weird ways a good thing.

59:44.800 --> 59:47.080
It doesn't mean they're not mining your data,

59:47.080 --> 59:48.920
but at least they're not just gonna randomly

59:48.920 --> 59:50.480
shut down the service on you.

59:50.480 --> 59:53.040
So if you wanna add it to your arsenal of photo options,

59:53.040 --> 59:54.240
that's a great way to go.

59:54.240 --> 59:57.560
I think it works best as a complimentary offsite backup

59:57.560 --> 59:58.920
and not the primary.

59:58.920 --> 01:00:02.760
And I think that's where having a local cache

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.600
that I can then throw into these tools

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.720
that we've just covered

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.400
is gonna make me feel a lot more comfortable.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.880
So thanks for the rundown, Alex.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.080
Absolutely, you're very welcome.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.280
I mean, there's, like I say,

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.280
there's loads and loads of other options

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.120
we didn't get time to talk about today.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:19.240
You know, PyWeGo, PyGallery2, Pixel Fed,

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.920
PhotoView, Thumbs Up, Koken.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.400
I mean, the list goes on and on.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.400
Let's UNLOCK and we'll get started.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.960
jupitrgarage.com is getting restocked

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.400
with some brand new items.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.240
They're not in yet, but for the first time,

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:38.960
we've reached that goal of clearing out a lot of the old,

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.360
not everything, not everything,

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.800
but we have made enough room to bring in some of the new,

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:45.760
which was always, always the goal.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.960
We are beginning that process right now.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.280
I am gonna keep it simple and humble like we have been,

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.520
you know, baby steps here,

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:55.460
can grab the seasoned tux tee on sale right now.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.020
That's a shirt that I created.

01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:57.700
It's a new item.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:05.860
It is a all black t-shirt with a gray and dark gray bearded version of the tux

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:07.460
holding the Jupiter broadcasting rocket.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:11.420
The, uh, the, the seasoned tux, as I call it.

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:14.080
And, uh, it's on sale right now at Jupiter garage.com.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:15.780
If you'd like to grab one.

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:24.380
And now for some feedback, Mark from Lenovo writes in.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.620
Hello, Chris and Wes.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.740
I'm the technical lead for the Linux PC team at Lenovo.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:32.460
Hello, Mark.

01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:39.420
I was listening to episode 405 and you mentioned the battery life on the X1 Carbon.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.740
I figured it would be interesting to reach out to the firmware slash hardware team

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.980
here for their input.

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:52.220
I've now got a bunch of battery related ACPI APIs that I need to go through and

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.620
see how they fit into what the kernel has.

01:01:54.660 --> 01:02:00.700
Although most of them are there already, but I also got some feedback on battery

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.980
charging thresholds looking through the docs.

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:10.460
One of the things I noted is that charging thresholds really depend on typical usage.

01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:11.980
So here's the scenario.

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:17.300
If you regularly fully discharge the battery, then actually the default setting

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:24.620
of starting to charge at 95% and going up to 100% is apparently fine.

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:31.500
But in a different scenario, if you regularly somewhat discharge the battery, but not all

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:37.700
the way, say operating between 50% and a hundred percent, then the techs recommend

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:42.820
starting charging at 75% and stopping at 80%.

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:48.300
And for a final scenario, if you're connected to power the majority of the time, in that

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.780
case, you want to start at 45 stop at 50.

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:55.780
I was surprised, frankly, at how small the windows were.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:00.180
I expected to see something more like 30% to 80%.

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:06.260
And I've also got some questions in to better understand typical degradation, like is

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:10.660
dropping to 96% in the first six months actually normal?

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.180
No idea what the curve looks like in most cases.

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.260
Holler if you have any questions.

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:20.500
Happy to forward those on to the hardware team to Mark.

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:21.740
Well, thanks, Mark.

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:25.580
I think the the the bit that stands out and that's from the Lenovo team that stands out

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:29.700
to me is if you're connected to power the majority of the time with your ThinkPad, you

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:33.580
should try to keep your battery charge in the 45 to 50% range.

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.420
I wish I knew that earlier.

01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:36.460
Yeah. And Mark's right.

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:39.580
That is a really that's a 5% range that is really small.

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:42.140
I am achieving that with TLP right now.

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:47.140
And it bit me once because, of course, I was I was off grid, open up the laptop.

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.300
It only had 50% battery.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.820
Oh, right.

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:53.180
I need to take action beforehand.

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:58.020
But we got a bunch of feedback in about how people are extending battery life or managing

01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.620
TLP on Linux.

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:02.700
So if you've already sent an email to that regard, we received it.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:06.780
But if you haven't yet and you have some battery management tips or the ways that you've

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:11.820
used TLP or things that you found that have extended your Linux battery life, please get

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:15.780
those in now at Linux unplugged dot com slash contact, because I think we're going to do

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:19.980
a batch of feedback next week and kind of put a cap on this battery discussion because

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:24.180
I have received a few cool tricks from the audience that I want to relay to everybody.

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:29.060
And I went on this trip the entire time using TLP, have some regrets, but also I think

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:30.100
there was some positives to it.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:33.100
So we'll follow up next episode on that.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:37.300
And thank you to Mark for reaching out from Lenovo and getting some info straight from

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:42.500
the team. I really appreciate the ability to pass on that to the community because, you

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.700
know, that's straight from, as they say, the horse's mouth.

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:50.420
So Linux unplugged dot com slash contact for your feedback and whatnot.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.580
We are back to our regular live time.

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:58.740
So if you'd like to join us for a live episode, we do them on Tuesdays at noon Pacific, 3

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:00.580
p.m. Eastern over at J.B.

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:02.940
Live TV. Thank you to our members.

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:06.580
Those of you who have become members, you get access to the limited ad version of the

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.580
show and the full live stream.

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:11.180
So thank you very much to our unplugged core members.

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:12.980
You all are the very best.

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:16.900
See you next week. Same bad time, same bad station.

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:21.620
That's right. Either way, it comes out every week over at Linux unplugged dot com.

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:25.820
You can go to Linux unplugged dot com slash subscribe to get the feeds for all different

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:31.020
players that you like, and you can follow the show on the Twitter at Linux unplugged.

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:35.660
You can follow the West at West Paine can follow me at Chris Lass.

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:39.860
But you know what? It's really if you want to get something to show, it's probably best to

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:42.740
use the contact page that works probably the best.

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:46.260
But, you know, I haven't mentioned the matrix in a while and the major community continues

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:48.180
to grow. Despite that, shout out to them.

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.740
Info at Linux unplugged dot com slash matrix.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:53.820
We're in there. We're hanging out. It's a great spot.

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:59.300
So thanks so much for joining us and we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:40.100
So has anybody given the old Google take out a try to get their photos out, Alex?

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:41.380
I know you were experimenting with that.

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.500
We talked about it in the show briefly, didn't we?

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:51.220
And my link came in today, funnily enough, and I have I'm now the proud owner of a hundred

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:54.300
and forty four two gigabyte files.

01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:57.300
That's how they gave me the takeout stuff.

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.940
Holy. And then how do you download that?

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:01.100
What's the UI to download?

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:06.660
Is it a URL? Like it's an email with one hundred and forty four individual links in it.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.180
There's no download all button.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:10.500
You just have to go through them one by one.

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:14.260
That's interesting because with Google Play Music, you had the option of downloading

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.620
everything as a large zip file.

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.020
That doesn't really seem like that great of an option, Alex.

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:20.740
I got to say. But, yeah, I mean, come on.

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:27.740
I've I've got 10, 15 years worth of images in there and every SLR image I've ever taken,

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:30.180
every mobile image. So there's a lot of data in there.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:51.300
So one massive zip file wouldn't really be very feasible, I don't think.
