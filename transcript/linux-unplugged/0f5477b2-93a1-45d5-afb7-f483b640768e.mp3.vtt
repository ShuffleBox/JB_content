WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
I wanted a good keyboard and there weren't any out there. I figured, well, how hard could this be?

00:06.000 --> 00:10.960
And then we built the best keyboard we possibly could. It's not what you'd expect from a keyboard,

00:10.960 --> 00:16.080
but people love it. Creating a keyboard is kind of a weird thing. It's been an obsession.

00:17.360 --> 00:24.560
All right, Wes, can you master the keyboardio that runs Linux in a beautiful hardware body?

00:24.560 --> 00:31.120
It is the keyboardio, a mechanical switch keyboard, custom sculpted keycaps. It's a dream to type on

00:31.120 --> 00:38.080
and it sells for $329. Wes Payne has it here in studio hooked up USB-C to his laptop.

00:38.080 --> 00:43.840
It has Arduino boards inside. Wes Payne, can you light the keyboardio on fire? What do you think,

00:43.840 --> 00:48.640
sir? Well, it's either going to look beautiful or turn into a brick. One way or the other,

00:48.640 --> 00:52.960
a lot of fun. We'll do it live on this week's episode of Linux Unplugged. Keyboardio,

00:52.960 --> 00:59.120
the only keyboard where you can install plugins that make it look like your keyboard is on fire.

00:59.120 --> 01:13.840
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 279 for December 11th, 2018.

01:13.840 --> 01:29.600
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's making its list and checking

01:29.600 --> 01:35.120
it twice. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes. I'm very excited about today's show.

01:35.120 --> 01:40.480
Not only because you're lighting your keyboard on fire, you maniac, but we're going to share

01:40.480 --> 01:46.640
a WireGuard success story this week. We implemented that brand new Linux VPN in production

01:46.640 --> 01:51.280
here at Jupiter Broadcasting, and it kicked butt. Yeah, Chris doesn't hate it. I mean,

01:51.280 --> 01:56.480
that's how you know. It was really great. And man, is it fast. We'll tell you about our

01:57.040 --> 02:03.440
WireGuard success story. But first, we're going to start out with a big batch of community news,

02:03.440 --> 02:08.000
a little check in on the Ubuntu 1904 development cycle. I'm running it here today in the studio,

02:08.000 --> 02:15.920
and a potential fix for that crazy CPU system D dominating issue I talked about last week that

02:15.920 --> 02:22.240
was wrecking my box. And then we'll finally introduce the name of our automation system

02:22.240 --> 02:26.720
that you voted on. You did it. Not our fault. Can't blame us for this one. We're innocent.

02:26.720 --> 02:33.760
We totally. And then we'll wrap up the show if time allows, you know, because time. Actually,

02:33.760 --> 02:40.320
it's Joe really. If Joe allows, he does. He gets mad. But if Joe allows and time permits,

02:40.320 --> 02:46.560
we have not one, but two fantastic fricking picks this week that are really great. And one of them

02:46.560 --> 02:50.320
that just might bring me back to Reddit. But before we go any further, we got to bring in

02:50.320 --> 02:59.280
that virtual log time appropriate. Greetings. Mumble room. Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hello, Mr. Badger,

02:59.280 --> 03:04.480
MiniMech, Sean, and the silent drifter. It's good to see you. And we have a whole bunch up

03:04.480 --> 03:09.280
in quiet listening to Wes. How are you doing? You feeling all right? You good? You didn't get sick?

03:09.280 --> 03:13.200
Yeah, no, I don't. I think I'm I think I've recovered any any, you know, amount of I was

03:13.200 --> 03:17.120
pretty tired. We got back. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, definitely crashed. But after that,

03:17.120 --> 03:20.880
I was exhausted. I was convinced I was gonna get sick. Wes and I just got back from the Linux

03:20.880 --> 03:26.480
Academy holiday party. And we're now we're like who raw full of team spirit. Really, you know,

03:26.480 --> 03:31.040
they do these things. And I'm like role my team building exercises. I will admit to being

03:31.040 --> 03:35.360
conditioned from some of my past employers to have a very similar attitude. But the game shows

03:36.000 --> 03:41.680
that were hosted by Tom Hazlett were pretty good. And one of the final questions it was like a

03:41.680 --> 03:45.280
family feud. I was wondering if you're going to mention that. How can I not? You have to Yeah,

03:45.280 --> 03:50.960
I'm still going. I am still upset about this. This was like Friday morning. This happened. And

03:50.960 --> 03:55.680
now it's Tuesday of the next week. And I'm still upset. So it's family feud style name Linux

03:55.680 --> 04:00.880
distributions, right. And so like if you surveyed Google or the or people or whatever the scenario

04:00.880 --> 04:06.880
was, these were the top 10 Linux distributions, the top five Linux distributions. And so you know,

04:07.600 --> 04:10.560
first group first table shouts out Ubuntu, you know, because it's their turn,

04:11.200 --> 04:15.120
that family Ubuntu goes up, boom, number one on the board, of course, of course, right.

04:16.480 --> 04:22.000
So then they shout out another distribution. I can't remember what it was. And wasn't on the

04:22.000 --> 04:26.800
board. So you know, they so they so they lose switches to our table, the other family. And

04:26.800 --> 04:30.800
at this point, like it's it's a process of elimination. And it's down to us and them.

04:30.800 --> 04:36.480
And I'm all in. And I'm like, this is my domain. I know what the popular distros are. This is what

04:36.480 --> 04:41.600
you were hired for. Right. So he turns to me, you know, Mr. Fisher, what's your answer? I say, Tom,

04:42.320 --> 04:46.960
Linux Mint, right? Because that's a huge lots of desktop users use. I mean, we don't talk about it

04:46.960 --> 04:52.160
a ton because we don't use it. But lots of lots of new users to Linux use Linux Mint. Ubuntu made

04:52.160 --> 04:59.920
sense. Linux Mint. Not on the list. Not on the list. You know what was on the top five list?

04:59.920 --> 05:04.720
Manjaro. Not Linux Mint, but Manjaro. How can I not be sore about that? How can I not be sore

05:04.720 --> 05:09.680
about that? I tell you what. Now, apparently this was sourced from like Google rankings.

05:09.680 --> 05:14.480
So maybe there's some something there. I'm using Manjaro right now. You are not helping at all.

05:14.480 --> 05:19.200
You know what it is, is that with KDE, though. So it's all fine. I'm just saying, like, would

05:19.200 --> 05:24.000
anybody in this Mumble Room disagree with the statement that Mint is way larger than Manjaro?

05:24.560 --> 05:30.720
No, no, no. Right. I mean, I mean, it's a great distribution. Actually met a Mint user in the

05:30.720 --> 05:35.280
in real life, though. I will disagree. Oh, just for the sake of disagree.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.240
And there's Dar. Dar's made it to the Mumble Room. I'll say this, though. Great fun. There's a lot

05:44.240 --> 05:47.360
of really smart people. We're going to start figuring out how to get some of them on the shows

05:47.360 --> 05:52.480
because these people really think about this stuff a lot. You you made some friends. You were out.

05:52.480 --> 05:56.400
You were really, you know, Westpain. Westpain is a gentleman socializer. I'll tell you,

05:57.040 --> 06:00.480
shucking and jiving out there. Well, I mean, it was nice, right? There's a especially at a company

06:00.480 --> 06:04.640
where most people work remotely. This is this is a great opportunity to get to meet some people.

06:04.640 --> 06:08.080
And yeah, everyone's nice. And they just want to they want to help people learn cool new stuff.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.360
My biggest regret really is that we didn't bring Joe out. Like we're on the fence. We're like,

06:11.360 --> 06:15.040
it's not enough time. We should have given we should have known more. It was just it just

06:15.040 --> 06:19.360
didn't work out this time. But so we'll have to treat him well. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We'll treat him

06:19.360 --> 06:24.480
well. All right. Well, while Wes is hacking away. Do you have you? Are you actually doing your input

06:24.480 --> 06:30.160
over the keyboardio right now? I started to and then it was very, very slow. It's an unusual

06:30.160 --> 06:34.960
way. It's not QWERTY. It's not. No, no. I think I could get used to it with time. But yeah,

06:34.960 --> 06:39.840
for the sake of you know, we have a small amount of time that Joe as we said, I'm cheating a bit.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.040
Okay. All right. Well, we'll check in with you later on the show and see how it's going.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.440
So we had a tweet come in to me and the Ubuntu podcast from crimbus. He says Yo,

06:47.440 --> 06:53.520
at Chris last, I'm tired of depending on our internet to play movies for the kiddo.

06:53.520 --> 06:58.400
I was trying to rip some DVDs tonight using VLC and acid rip in hopes to run them off of a home

06:58.400 --> 07:06.720
server. But either the video ends up glitchy AF, as he says, or there's no audio any suggestions.

07:06.720 --> 07:12.000
Now, I gave him a quick rundown of the tools I use, like make MKV and handbrake. Oh, yeah,

07:12.000 --> 07:17.200
those are both great. If you want full quality make MKV, bring it in via Blu Ray and just put it

07:17.200 --> 07:21.600
you just drop all of the different video files and languages you don't need. And you end up with

07:21.600 --> 07:27.120
a largest file, but it's the exact encoding right off the disk. So it's as good as it's going to be

07:27.120 --> 07:33.200
on the disk. If you need it smaller from there. So like in crimbuses case here, he's making it for

07:33.200 --> 07:38.480
the kiddos, kiddos, you know, they don't care if it's 720p versus 1080p or 4k, you could put it in

07:38.480 --> 07:43.360
720p and upscale it and they're going to be okay. And so you could run it through handbrake, you

07:43.360 --> 07:46.720
know, get yourself a nice small file. Yeah, it adds up if you have a lot of those, you know,

07:46.720 --> 07:52.560
so that was the tools part. But then that the big question is how do you serve this up to the kiddos?

07:52.560 --> 07:59.360
And my answer from when he tweeted this to what I'm going to say now has dramatically changed

07:59.360 --> 08:06.400
in the last week. Thanks to the people over at MB, I was gonna be really derogatory. I'll just

08:06.400 --> 08:12.720
say the people over at MB, who are shattering our dreams of an open source Plex competitor

08:12.720 --> 08:17.920
this week by announcing that they're shifting to a closed source core with open source components,

08:19.200 --> 08:24.960
which is the exact model Plex uses. Actually, in fact, it may be now at this point Plex has

08:24.960 --> 08:29.600
more open source code in it than MB does, depending on where they fall on this whole thing,

08:29.600 --> 08:34.560
where it all falls down. And MB is sort of botching the communication. In their release,

08:34.560 --> 08:38.240
there's some implications that make you read between the lines. And then when people ask for

08:38.240 --> 08:42.320
clarification on GitHub, the project came out and explained in further detail what was going on.

08:42.320 --> 08:46.080
It does seem like communication has been one of those things that the community has not always

08:46.080 --> 08:51.440
been happy with for a couple of years in this project. This is a big shame because this was,

08:51.440 --> 08:55.840
I think, its biggest feature for our community was the fact that it was open source. You could

08:55.840 --> 09:00.880
use it without having to have an MB cloud account if you wanted to. I have it running on a droplet

09:00.880 --> 09:05.200
for ages now and here at the studio, and I like it so much. I didn't want them to change anything.

09:05.200 --> 09:09.680
I became a premium subscriber just to support them. I wanted them to stick around. I did the

09:09.680 --> 09:13.520
same exact thing. The real shame. And it was nice too, right? Because, I mean, it was open source.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.320
It was easy to package. I have like an Arc system that's running it, and it was just

09:16.320 --> 09:22.880
like, install MB and away you go. And it feels like this is still kind of developing,

09:22.880 --> 09:27.040
so we don't have all the details yet. So I don't want to raise the full panic flag.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.480
I want to give them time to communicate better what's going on.

09:30.480 --> 09:36.480
It couldn't have come at a worse time either. The whole Plex community over the last couple

09:36.480 --> 09:41.280
of months on Reddit has been getting slowly more and more toxic. Go figure. It's Reddit, right? But

09:41.280 --> 09:50.640
the Plex clients and UIs have been going through all sorts of crazy... My uncle is in Vancouver,

09:50.640 --> 09:55.120
and he streams from my Plex server all the time. And they updated his Roku this week,

09:55.120 --> 10:01.200
and he's been texting me all week. He's 70, right? He's been texting me all week. How do I use this

10:01.200 --> 10:06.560
new version of Plex? I'm like, I don't know. I don't have a Roku. I can't help. And so now he's

10:06.560 --> 10:12.240
stuck. And so thanks, Plex, for that. So I think there's a lot of people in a similar situation

10:12.240 --> 10:20.080
looking for a decent alternative. And MB is, was, it, but now, I don't know.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.400
Yeah. Drifter, have you run into this with your Roku?

10:22.400 --> 10:27.280
Oh, absolutely. And it's really obnoxious too, because not only did they not really tell you

10:27.280 --> 10:31.360
about it, it just kind of all of a sudden you went to go use it, and it was completely different.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.280
Oh, yeah. It's good stuff. That's exactly what you want on the TV when you watch a show.

10:35.280 --> 10:38.880
That's exactly what you want on the TV when you want to just sit down, turn it on, and chill out.

10:38.880 --> 10:43.040
It's so frustrating. Yeah. I think the problem with Plex is they've been taking their eye off

10:43.040 --> 10:47.600
the ball a little bit, and they're trying to focus, ironically for me to say this, but they're trying

10:47.600 --> 10:52.400
to focus on web media, like podcasts and stuff. And while I'm kind of like, cool, another platform

10:52.400 --> 10:56.800
to distribute our shows on, that's good as the content creator, but like the viewer of me is

10:56.800 --> 11:01.360
like, no. I just want this to work really well. I have a whole bunch of offline media I want to

11:01.360 --> 11:05.680
watch. I've got a USB drive plugged into this machine, and I just want you to index it really

11:05.680 --> 11:09.120
well and keep track of what I've watched and make it possible for me to watch it on my

11:09.120 --> 11:15.200
portable devices. Yeah. And I think in the past, MB has benefited. It had great integration with

11:15.200 --> 11:19.520
Kodi, which I use a lot, and that works very well. So I think there's been some of that spirit,

11:19.520 --> 11:22.800
right? It's open. You can kind of hack on it as you need to. You can make this sort of rich

11:22.800 --> 11:28.560
ecosystem around it. I don't know. I kind of worry about that now too. Yeah. So I use the

11:28.560 --> 11:35.760
NVIDIA Shield, which I know you do too, Chris. Love it. And the Plex Android client has gotten

11:35.760 --> 11:40.240
slowly less and less. You just want to click on something and it just should just work first time

11:40.240 --> 11:47.680
every time. And it tries to transcode everything. So to fix that, I have gone into Kodi and installed

11:47.680 --> 11:54.800
Plex for Kodi. And now everything plays direct play first time every time. So along the same lines

11:54.800 --> 12:01.760
as Wes really, like Kodi, thank God, is the answer. Yeah. That's exactly how I use it now too, because

12:02.480 --> 12:08.320
a lot of times when I'm in the RV, I'm connected via a MiFi. And if it's going out to the Plex

12:08.880 --> 12:13.520
cloud to even broker the connection over my LAN, which sometimes even I'm trying to play over my

12:13.520 --> 12:18.240
LAN, it wants to broker a connection over the internet. Kodi solves that problem every single

12:18.240 --> 12:22.960
damn time. So whatever we land on here in this conversation, keep that in the back of your mind.

12:22.960 --> 12:31.200
Kodi is a great tool for that. So we had a little look around. And Wes, you found a couple of things.

12:31.200 --> 12:36.400
First of all, let's just start with the one-to-one replacement. Jellyfin has been announced,

12:36.400 --> 12:40.400
which is a fork of MB, right? Are you laughing at my pronunciation of it?

12:40.400 --> 12:42.000
No, I was just enjoying it.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.240
How would you say it?

12:45.280 --> 12:46.080
I'm not arguing.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.080
Jelfin? Would you say gel? No, because it's got a... No, jellyfin.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.120
I think jellyfin.

12:51.120 --> 12:51.760
Jellyfin.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.600
Yeah, okay. You're just smirking over there.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.760
I'm just enjoying it. You said it so well.

12:55.760 --> 12:59.280
Thank you. Well, I tried it. If I'm going to mispronounce it, I'm going to try to mispronounce

12:59.280 --> 13:03.040
it with some level of confidence, just so that way it doesn't make people like... It's not

13:03.040 --> 13:06.640
distracting, right? Because if I sit here and I torture myself over it, that's distracting,

13:06.640 --> 13:11.840
like this conversation is. They forked it right at the point before all this happened.

13:11.840 --> 13:17.360
And did you note in here too that they talk about they're rebasing some of it on.NET Core as well.

13:17.360 --> 13:18.400
Hey, that's kind of neat.

13:18.400 --> 13:24.320
Isn't that fascinating? So jellyfin is a fork of MB. The MB crew basically said,

13:25.280 --> 13:30.080
good luck with that. That was essentially their response to it. So I don't see what that means.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.960
How many people will move over? Will there be a new community over at jellyfin?

13:34.960 --> 13:36.080
Maybe, maybe.

13:37.280 --> 13:44.560
All we need to do is these fork guys to actually set up a subscription model. We subscribe there

13:45.120 --> 13:48.000
and we let them see who actually had the good luck.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.400
Yeah. Yeah, possibly. Yeah. But Wes, you also found this StreamServer.org. Is that what it is?

13:54.400 --> 14:02.640
Is that what the URL StreamServer.org or Streama, Streama, Streama Server.org, which is a really

14:02.640 --> 14:09.920
kind of low, low feature. I like it. It's an MVP. Yeah. It's like a minimum viable

14:09.920 --> 14:17.040
streaming system, but it is in fact, a video library organizer and streamer that apparently

14:17.040 --> 14:23.120
also has a Google Play app. I did also notice one feature, which I have not tried, although I did.

14:23.120 --> 14:27.920
It was pretty easy to get running. I have not been able to make it run in a way that we could

14:27.920 --> 14:32.400
actually use it, but it is just a war file that you can execute if you have Java. So that's easy.

14:33.120 --> 14:37.600
It says here, live sync watching. Watch with your loved ones remotely with sync for play,

14:37.600 --> 14:42.160
pause and scrubbing. And if that is true, that's money. Game changer. That's something that Wes

14:42.160 --> 14:45.840
and I have been trying to figure out because when I'm traveling, I have to stop watching

14:45.840 --> 14:49.120
Star Trek Deep Space Nine. And I've been marathoning Deep Space Nine. Nothing makes

14:49.120 --> 14:52.560
it grumpy with that, you know, when you don't get your nine. And now season five is taken forever,

14:52.560 --> 14:57.120
right? So if we could do this, that would be huge. That'd be huge. All right. You got to get that.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.400
We got to get, you got to try that, Wes. That'd be great. And I know you want to try to solve

15:00.400 --> 15:04.560
the same thing. So Streama is the one that may also be an alternative if Kodi doesn't work for

15:04.560 --> 15:11.280
you. I don't know about that though. So what, so it's a, it's a Java app is what it is. It's all Java.

15:11.280 --> 15:18.960
It's all Java. I mean, I guess that's fine. Yeah, no, I guess that's fine. No, I know. I know.

15:18.960 --> 15:24.080
I know. That's true. It's just, I don't know. I don't know why it just gives me pause. I shouldn't,

15:24.080 --> 15:27.120
right? I'm bad. I shouldn't. It shouldn't. It's probably makes it even easier to run it on any

15:27.120 --> 15:33.440
Linux distro and stuff like that. So I guess in a lot of ways it's, it's pretty good. All right. Well,

15:33.440 --> 15:37.200
so I, a little, a little sneaky fact here, even though I already told you, I've been running

15:37.200 --> 15:42.080
Ubuntu 1904 all day here on our production system just to give it a go off of a live,

15:42.080 --> 15:47.200
off of a live USB 3. And I thought maybe we'd do a little disco-dingo roundup.

15:47.200 --> 16:11.920
So disco-dingo is set to be released on February 12th, I think. No, it's a feature freeze. Feature

16:11.920 --> 16:18.080
freeze is February 21st, 2019. And the UI freeze, March 4th, 2019. And the kernel freeze, April 1st.

16:18.080 --> 16:23.360
Wow. That is a lot of specific dates. This is an article that Joey wrote for OMG Ubuntu.

16:23.360 --> 16:28.800
And the release date is April 18th, 2019. That's right. April 18th. Look forward to it.

16:29.360 --> 16:34.560
I'm thrilled, Wes. I'm thrilled. So this is kind of fun to just sort of take a look at where it's

16:34.560 --> 16:40.000
at right now. If all goes to plan, it'll be shipping GNOME 3.32, Linux kernel 5.0 possibly

16:40.000 --> 16:46.240
if it's ready, if it's ready. And a bunch of other little performance tweaks to GNOME. Well,

16:46.240 --> 16:50.640
I actually shouldn't say little. In fact, there's some pretty significant performance tweaks to

16:50.640 --> 16:59.840
GNOME Shell in 1904. In fact, enough that's kind of got me a little tempted to give this a go once

16:59.840 --> 17:05.520
it's released. Not that Plasma's still been doing great, but if they shook out a lot of the performance

17:05.520 --> 17:10.560
fixes, Wes. The call of GNOME. I can see it in your eyes. Well, you've gone mad. The area where

17:10.560 --> 17:15.600
they're doing extensive work right now is in multi-monitor performance and management. And

17:15.600 --> 17:20.240
that is an area in which I am struggling right now, now that I've got that dock with three monitors.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.280
You're in a new world. It's a new multi-monitor world. Who would have thought that's what would

17:23.280 --> 17:30.720
bring you back to GNOME? Not me. Not me. No. Is there anything that jumps out at you about the...

17:30.720 --> 17:34.880
So this is a Phronix article here that talks about some of the performance fixes. Is there

17:34.880 --> 17:39.360
any in particular in this roundup that Michael's done here that jump out at you? Okay, well,

17:39.360 --> 17:44.640
they are working on showing pending kernel live patches via the update manager user interface.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.760
That would be nice. Yeah, because right now you don't get to see that at all. No, and live

17:47.760 --> 17:52.240
patches are kind of a nice feature that you might not get or at least as well integrated on some

17:52.240 --> 17:56.960
other distros. Yeah, I use it on these two systems. Really? On these two on the desk here. Yeah,

17:56.960 --> 18:01.120
that's nice, I think. Of course, you know, there's like latest packages and all the other goodies.

18:01.120 --> 18:07.440
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, except for Nautilus. Except for Nautilus. I have been following their Trello,

18:07.440 --> 18:15.200
which is public, turns out, for Ubuntu 19.04. And this is where I started to get an idea of the

18:15.200 --> 18:20.640
level of fixes that are coming into GNOME Shell. I'm not positive all of this is going to be

18:20.640 --> 18:25.120
upstream. I mean, they're submitting it upstream. You never know what's actually going to take you,

18:25.120 --> 18:30.560
right? Yeah, exactly. I'm not sure it's getting accepted. Important question. How much of these

18:30.560 --> 18:41.360
fixes that are being pushed for are advent of IBM acquisition? Oh, no, I think a lot of this has been

18:41.360 --> 18:46.320
in place since Canonical switched to GNOME, because the couple of the individuals, I've met

18:46.320 --> 18:52.640
them at an Ubuntu rally. And while I mean, this was, was this April of last year? Was that April?

18:52.640 --> 18:56.400
That was April of last year. Yep. Where they were talking about how they were going to start working

18:56.400 --> 19:04.720
on fixing performance issues upstream in GNOME. And that they did a lot of that recently, but 19.04

19:04.720 --> 19:09.200
seems when I read through their Trello, it seems like it's a huge list of them. And it just makes

19:09.200 --> 19:15.040
me wonder if maybe it's going to be time to give GNOME another go and if maybe the Ubuntu spin of

19:15.040 --> 19:20.240
GNOME might be a particular performed or performance. I don't know. It's just worth trying,

19:20.240 --> 19:24.160
I think. Well, I mean, and we were coming into our own, right? I mean, it's not that long that

19:24.160 --> 19:27.520
they switched back to GNOME in the first place. So now we're kind of seeing some of the we've

19:27.520 --> 19:32.800
lived here for a while. What do we got to fix? So I've been trying it here. It pretty much right

19:32.800 --> 19:38.080
now looks like 1810 theme wise and look wise. It's got the you know, more updated apps. It's got the

19:38.080 --> 19:41.760
new GNOME shell, including that new GNOME to do list manager, which we were playing around with on

19:41.760 --> 19:45.680
the pre show stream. Yeah, it looks nice. Yeah, it is nice. And you know what it is very quick,

19:45.680 --> 19:50.720
even for running off a USB three thumb drive. It's very quick. It's very, very quick. So it's got that

19:50.720 --> 19:56.080
new fresh feel. So you have to know what you're doing the show here today. No problem. Yeah. Yeah.

19:56.080 --> 20:00.800
The only thing I don't have is our highlights for the for the shows. But I suppose I can probably

20:00.800 --> 20:06.400
figure that out. But yeah, it's not bad. And the GNOME UI itself. I like some of the tweaks,

20:06.400 --> 20:10.320
canonicals done. I really like their doc. And I don't use it a lot, you know, because I'm a

20:10.320 --> 20:14.480
plasma user. So I haven't used their their version of GNOME. It's pretty much since they've launched

20:14.480 --> 20:20.480
it. I was pretty much when I switched to plasma. But it's not bad. It's actually a pretty damn good

20:20.480 --> 20:25.120
implementation. And you combine it with the new GNOME three settings the screen, you know,

20:25.120 --> 20:28.720
that's been around for a while. And it's just I like it. It feels kind of simple. Yeah, simple.

20:28.720 --> 20:33.040
Yeah, it's simple and polished. And the Thunderbolt three support now is also extra

20:33.040 --> 20:37.360
appreciated more than ever, more than ever. West. So yeah, I give it I give it the old

20:37.360 --> 20:41.600
thumbs up here on the Linux unplugged review. I'd say they're in a right in the right direction

20:41.600 --> 20:46.160
stability wise. It's been I've just been running it for the day. So I can't make like a firm like

20:46.160 --> 20:52.880
Oh, yeah, it's it's the most stable release ever. But I'm legitimately in the past I did have no

20:52.880 --> 20:56.000
shell crash on me at this point. Like it didn't take more than an eight hour workday to have

20:56.000 --> 21:00.560
no shell crash on me. And I've made it that far. So that's that's pretty good. That is pretty good.

21:00.560 --> 21:09.120
I'm looking forward to the disco dingo. Gotta play twice, you know, because it's so great.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.800
It's the first thing I thought of when they made amazing. Isn't that great? It is great.

21:12.800 --> 21:18.080
But canonical is also making some news this week in the enterprise space. It is KubeCon.

21:18.640 --> 21:23.520
KubeCon North America is going on just down the street from us this week. And canonical

21:23.520 --> 21:29.520
is making some noise really before the event has even opened its doors. And they've been

21:29.520 --> 21:33.840
working in the Kubernetes space since 2014. But this year, I think they're really trying to say

21:33.840 --> 21:39.520
this is our offering. Yeah, that is right. One of those things that got people talking was

21:39.520 --> 21:45.600
MicroK8s. What? Yeah, MicroKris. Is this already a known thing? A MicroK8? Or is this something

21:45.600 --> 21:49.600
they've made up? As far as you know? Well, it's a new project. It's there. It's there. There's

21:49.600 --> 21:53.600
already, you know, there's already attempts like Minikube to get a system running just for

21:53.600 --> 21:57.360
development. You don't want to play with it on one box. I asked you to set up that Kubernetes

21:57.360 --> 22:01.280
cluster weeks ago and you still haven't finished tying all the string together. That is true. That

22:01.280 --> 22:06.560
is true. Well, now you with the snap install MicroK8s, that job would be done for you. Oh,

22:06.560 --> 22:10.240
I see. So it's like a full, complete, ready to go out of the box or out of the snap.

22:11.600 --> 22:15.520
Kubernetes environment. Yeah, full featured. Includes automatic updates, well-defined

22:15.520 --> 22:20.720
security capabilities, and some of Canonical's open source add-on services such as a container

22:20.720 --> 22:28.080
registry, storage pass through and native GPGPU enablement for hardware acceleration and machine

22:28.080 --> 22:33.680
learning workflows. Yeah, you've got those GPGs. You've got those GPUs. Too many Gs. If you need

22:33.680 --> 22:40.320
to compute those GPGs on those GPUs, then you're set. Oh yeah, in the cloud. And with this now,

22:40.320 --> 22:44.960
like you can see the game they're playing is they're wrapping it up with that Ubuntu

22:44.960 --> 22:49.120
Advantage support as well. So now they're making this an offering for their enterprises and Ubuntu

22:49.120 --> 22:53.760
Advantage subscription. So if you need Canonical support and taking care of managing all of this.

22:53.760 --> 22:58.800
And yeah, a big thing about that, too, is that you can get that support for clusters you've built

22:58.800 --> 23:04.320
with Kube admin. And so if you already built your own cluster and then you want Canonical's help

23:04.320 --> 23:08.240
managing it, you don't have to have it all set up customized by them to get started with that. So

23:08.240 --> 23:12.960
that's a big selling point. That's what a hungry company does. Hungry in a good way. We know this

23:12.960 --> 23:16.960
will be painful. Probably you've done some things wrong that we would have never done, but we want

23:16.960 --> 23:22.880
your business and we want to help. Yeah, and that is a way Canonical, isn't that a great example of

23:22.880 --> 23:27.760
how Canonical can be competitive in a way that IBM can't? IBM will, I mean, they'll come in and

23:27.760 --> 23:31.840
charge you to fix it. But what IBM wants is you do it to the standard, right? That's what Red Hat

23:31.840 --> 23:35.120
wants, too, is you do it to the standard. And if you could deviate from the standard, it may not be

23:35.120 --> 23:41.200
a supported configuration. And what Canonical is implicitly saying here is we'll bail you out and

23:41.200 --> 23:46.880
that that cluster F that you've built will manage it for you and fix it up. And that's a that's a

23:46.880 --> 23:50.640
hungry play. And I like it. Yeah, they were also talking about some new partnerships with people

23:50.640 --> 23:56.720
like Dell EMC and Supermicro. So those are both big names in big server business. So, you know,

23:56.720 --> 23:59.920
they are really trying to get their name out there in that space, which has been kind of

23:59.920 --> 24:04.240
dominated by Red Hat, at least in like the Kubernetes area. Yeah, it has. I kind of found

24:04.240 --> 24:08.880
out I found a really interesting tidbit. Do you know why it's called K8s? You probably do. I only

24:08.880 --> 24:12.720
found out the other day. It's because they took eight letters out of the middle of Kubernetes.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.440
Okay, that's what it is. I could have sworn that when we were, we did an episode for TechSnap,

24:19.440 --> 24:22.880
I did a ton of research. And I think I've unlearned a lot of the things I learned for that

24:22.880 --> 24:27.600
episode, because that was in there. That's funny. That's good. I don't think also, it's no small

24:27.600 --> 24:33.680
achievement here that you can now get a, as they call it a micro Kubernetes setup, with a snap

24:33.680 --> 24:39.200
install command. That's that is, it's a pretty good showcase of what snaps can offer in the

24:39.200 --> 24:45.200
enterprise is you can take this really complicated system, and you can boil it down to a single snap

24:45.200 --> 24:50.000
command. Oh, and by the way, it's also going to get updated. Yeah, right. And you can go poke,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.840
you know, go poke at it, see what's in there, go take a look at the at the YAML file, see how it's

24:53.840 --> 24:58.720
put together, play with it yourself. Well, it'll be interesting to see how that plays out. I think

24:58.720 --> 25:02.160
that's a space they can be pretty competitive in. And just kind of anecdotally today, I think it

25:02.160 --> 25:06.400
was Badger that mentioned when he got in here that DigitalOcean has taken their Kubernetes support out

25:06.400 --> 25:10.400
of beta and made it like an official thing. So you could have Ubuntu boxes on premises,

25:10.400 --> 25:14.800
you could have Ubuntu boxes on different cloud providers, and you're managing all from one

25:14.800 --> 25:19.840
Kubernetes system, like, not to sound too much like you six weeks ago, before you got bought out

25:19.840 --> 25:27.840
but I span up a Kubernetes cluster on DO in maybe three minutes. That's pretty nice. And you only

25:27.840 --> 25:31.360
pay for the app nodes, you don't pay for the workers or anything. So it's kind of like the

25:31.360 --> 25:36.640
GKS or the EKS model, ECS model, sorry. Rumor on the street has it you can still get $100 credit

25:36.640 --> 25:41.840
if you go to do.co slash L and L. That's the rumor. I don't know. I don't know if that's

25:41.840 --> 25:45.520
true or not. But if you still want to try out Kubernetes, if you want to go try out, you know

25:45.520 --> 25:49.840
what? Because the thing is, we're both still users. Were you not using DigitalOcean this weekend?

25:49.840 --> 25:54.160
True. This weekend, I spent up a high CPU drop last night. Oh, last night. That's when it was.

25:54.160 --> 26:00.320
Yeah. Yeah. A high CPU drop. What were you doing? Video encoding? Video encoding, weren't you?

26:00.320 --> 26:03.520
You're doing something with video. High CPU? No, math? You're doing something with math.

26:04.160 --> 26:08.000
You're doing mathy stuff? He's a math nerd, guys. He doesn't talk about it much on air,

26:08.000 --> 26:13.040
but Wes is a math nerd. Oh, you don't want to say. You want to tell me off air. Oh,

26:13.040 --> 26:17.920
okay. Oh, I like that even better. All right. Well, this next story is rather interesting.

26:17.920 --> 26:22.720
Wouldn't this be a cool feature to come to the x86 side of the house? But for right now,

26:22.720 --> 26:27.840
and probably forever, this is a feature coming to the ARM side of Linux, and it's a pretty cool one.

26:27.840 --> 26:33.360
It's energy aware scheduling for the mainline Linux kernel to better handle systems with

26:33.360 --> 26:38.800
asymmetric CPU topologies. Energy aware scheduling is designed to take into account information from

26:38.800 --> 26:43.920
the ARM energy model framework. So you can make better scheduling decisions based upon the topology

26:43.920 --> 26:47.840
of the CPU cores, and the performance and power characteristics, right? Because you might have

26:47.840 --> 26:51.120
this this sort of ARM board that's put together with all kinds of different components. And that

26:51.120 --> 26:56.880
can vary widely depending on is this for a smart fridge, right? Or is it for your Nvidia shield

26:56.880 --> 27:01.600
device? Those are usually different. Yeah, that's nice. And the work for supporting energy aware

27:01.600 --> 27:05.920
scheduling in the mainline kernel has been in the works for months. And you're not going to be

27:05.920 --> 27:11.440
surprised when you learn that Google's Android kernel team has already been supporting this

27:11.440 --> 27:16.160
technology in their core. This, you know, getting this in the mainline means one less thing that's

27:16.160 --> 27:20.320
in the that's in the Android kernel only. So that's kind of nice. Yeah. And if you look at

27:20.320 --> 27:24.640
some of the patchwork, the churn of all the work going on here, it's starting to settle down.

27:24.640 --> 27:29.280
Hopefully, that means it won't be much longer till we say it's in the mainline and energy aware

27:29.280 --> 27:34.640
scheduler sounds pretty neat, pretty, pretty neat. I think that'd be a good a good addition.

27:34.640 --> 27:41.360
You go down the road a few years, some of us might be rocking some Linux arm laptop of some form,

27:41.360 --> 27:44.880
and you can have just fantastic battery life or something like that. That could be really cool.

27:45.680 --> 27:51.200
Unless system D, you dev is eating 100% of your CPU, then your battery life is going to be

27:51.200 --> 27:55.760
horrible regardless of your CPU architecture. And that's what was happening to me last week

27:55.760 --> 28:01.360
talked about it on the show. Short version is after I got this Thunderbolt three doc with a GPU,

28:01.360 --> 28:08.640
and I installed the NVIDIA drivers and then disconnected my system and booted it without

28:08.640 --> 28:15.360
the doc connected system to you dev went crazy eating up 100% of one of my cores constantly

28:15.360 --> 28:19.840
trying to find the NVIDIA adapter connect and authorize it and initialize the driver.

28:19.840 --> 28:23.360
And then when that would fail because the hardware didn't exist because the doc was disconnected,

28:24.160 --> 28:29.120
it would freak out and use 100% of my CPU. And I discovered I could stop and start you dev manually

28:29.120 --> 28:33.920
manually and essentially solve this but I have to do it per boot when I'm not connected.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.360
Oh, that's pretty annoying.

28:35.360 --> 28:41.680
Yeah, it's not great. It's not great. But Mike wrote in with a system to you dev fix.

28:41.680 --> 28:44.720
And what's he doing here with what's he essentially accomplished with this?

28:44.720 --> 28:49.200
I mean, he's basically doing what you were doing on a offhand manner,

28:49.200 --> 28:53.280
making it happen for you at boot time. So you install the new service. And then all

28:53.280 --> 28:58.240
that service is doing is stopping all the various you dev things and the sockets that they listen on

28:58.240 --> 29:02.080
starting it back up. And then the rest of this his article is telling you just how to get that

29:02.080 --> 29:05.200
all enabled so that every time you boot up, that'll happen automatically.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.600
That's not a bad worker. So it's a workaround.

29:07.600 --> 29:12.240
I mean, it's a hack. Yeah, it's unfortunate that we have to you know, that these that

29:12.240 --> 29:13.680
you'd have won't figure it out.

29:13.680 --> 29:20.320
But what I liked about it is I don't have to I don't have to uninstall the NVIDIA driver.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.960
But my question would be what happens when I am connected to the doc?

29:22.960 --> 29:24.720
Don't I want that process to work?

29:24.720 --> 29:29.520
Well, you are restarting it. So I say you should do some research and find out.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.920
And report back to us here next week.

29:32.480 --> 29:35.840
Fair enough. Fair enough. Fair enough. I will. I will. I'll try to figure that out.

29:36.480 --> 29:40.880
All right. Well, before we get in to more like our WireGuard success story,

29:41.680 --> 29:46.560
I'm very excited about WireGuard now. We've been talking about it in the theory sense for a while.

29:46.560 --> 29:52.640
And this travel week was our opportunity to actually put it in production and it freaking worked.

29:52.640 --> 29:55.840
But a little housekeeping before we go any further in the show.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.280
A couple of things we need to let you know about.

29:57.920 --> 30:00.800
This is your chance, Wes, to get some progress on that keyboardio.

30:02.480 --> 30:05.440
First of all, if you want to get a hold of us Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact,

30:05.440 --> 30:06.400
please go there.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.600
Sign us in your app pics. I'm going to try to do more of those in every episode.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.280
And I've got my own feeds, of course.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.240
But if there is a command line app that you've been loving.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.800
Oh, we can't say that. That's command line nervous.

30:16.800 --> 30:20.560
If there is a command line app that you find to be quite swell.

30:20.560 --> 30:23.680
Something you're fond of, you think about at night when you're falling asleep.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.200
That's a whole other thing, Wes.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.920
But maybe Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.280
Also, just kind of fun little heads up.

30:33.280 --> 30:39.440
Wes and I at the end of this week are heading to System 76 to tour their factory in Denver,

30:39.440 --> 30:44.880
Colorado and sniff out the Thelio hardware and just get a sense for what kind of scale

30:44.880 --> 30:46.640
of an operation they got over there.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.760
So I'm really looking forward to that.

30:47.760 --> 30:49.200
I know. Exciting.

30:49.200 --> 30:52.400
Wes and I, after just getting to hang out in Texas, are going to get to go hang out in Denver.

30:52.960 --> 30:56.880
They are flying us out there as well as a bunch of other media.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.280
And they're doing a tour.

30:59.280 --> 31:04.720
And I think I've been talking to them about this for three months now about doing this

31:04.720 --> 31:06.960
and just trying to really.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.280
I mean, I've been a bit skeptical and they know that.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.320
And that's actually kind of what I respect about them willing to do this is I've been

31:14.320 --> 31:16.080
pretty skeptical about Papa Wes.

31:16.080 --> 31:17.600
I mean, I'm still reserving judgment.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.920
I want to give it like three to bake.

31:19.920 --> 31:20.640
Yeah, exactly.

31:20.640 --> 31:24.080
I want to give it like three or so years to really fully realize.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.480
But, you know, I've been pretty skeptical about Papa Wes.

31:27.440 --> 31:33.280
I'm kind of skeptical about a small operation opening up a U.S. manufacturing plant in Denver.

31:33.920 --> 31:39.600
I mean, we're not talking like we're not talking Arizona or West Texas where land where they

31:39.600 --> 31:41.200
basically are paying you to take the land.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.400
We're talking about Denver.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.040
Right.

31:43.040 --> 31:46.160
So I just been I've been a little skeptical.

31:46.160 --> 31:49.360
And so I've been and I feel like they're so important to the Linux community.

31:49.920 --> 31:54.000
There was a conversation at Linux Academy, like we want to add another Linux hardware

31:54.000 --> 31:54.320
vendor.

31:54.320 --> 31:54.960
Who should we add?

31:54.960 --> 31:57.760
And the first name that came into the list was System 76.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.760
And I want to be able to say with confidence, you do it.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.560
So this is hopefully what we're going to find out.

32:04.560 --> 32:06.240
So we're going there at the end of the week.

32:06.240 --> 32:09.680
They're going to give us the tour and then we'll be back next week and we'll report what

32:09.680 --> 32:10.000
we found.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.240
I think nonetheless, we're going to have a great time.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.040
I know that's going to happen.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.080
I know we're going to have a great time.

32:14.080 --> 32:19.440
So System 76 props to them for being willing to bring a critic out there at times.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.480
I try to, you know, I just try to be honest because you guys also know I've been a 10

32:22.480 --> 32:22.960
year customer.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.080
Well, more than that now.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.880
So still got three System 76 rigs.

32:26.880 --> 32:27.040
Yeah.

32:27.040 --> 32:27.360
I mean, right.

32:27.360 --> 32:29.760
I think that's probably an important perspective of.

32:29.760 --> 32:30.320
Yeah.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.160
We're concerned to tell you guys about it.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.720
But also, yeah, we want to we want to buy some of these rigs.

32:34.720 --> 32:35.520
Yeah, exactly.

32:35.520 --> 32:35.760
Yeah.

32:35.760 --> 32:36.720
So that should be good.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.800
We'll have a report next week when we get back.

32:38.800 --> 32:43.600
And we also have the results of our automation naming system.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.360
We've been building a system behind the scenes.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.520
We talked about it over the last few episodes.

32:48.160 --> 32:51.760
I don't know actually when, but it's been we have talked about over a few episodes.

32:51.760 --> 32:56.000
And it's it's pretty fun because it's not only solving some problems here at Jupiter

32:56.000 --> 33:01.040
Broadcasting, but it's given us an opportunity to think about releasing our own open source

33:01.040 --> 33:01.440
project.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.440
And that has been the most fun.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.120
And when I was all said and done, that is our goal is to release something that other

33:07.120 --> 33:15.120
podcasters can utilize to automate production, increase quality and accuracy, and maybe even

33:15.120 --> 33:16.000
eventually a lot more.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.600
I don't want to commit yet, but we have some really great long term plans.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.720
And so we asked you guys, what should we name this tool?

33:22.720 --> 33:26.160
This is a tool that we're going to be running all of our shows through, that it'll be like

33:26.160 --> 33:26.720
a verb.

33:26.720 --> 33:29.840
You know, make sure you run it through X, Y, Z because it's got to get posted today.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.000
Or did that go through X, Y, Z?

33:32.000 --> 33:36.640
And we asked you guys, we put it all out there and we had a bunch of really great suggestions.

33:36.640 --> 33:41.440
We got a decent sample size, even for not plugging it too much, 272 votes.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.160
Nice.

33:42.160 --> 33:42.960
I'll take it.

33:42.960 --> 33:43.680
You'd be surprised.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.680
That actually does end up being decently representative.

33:45.680 --> 33:48.640
Doesn't seem like it would be for the tens of thousands of downloads.

33:48.640 --> 33:51.280
But it actually, experience tells me it does.

33:51.840 --> 33:55.280
So one of the submissions with 8% of the votes was Jupiter Podcaster.

33:55.280 --> 33:55.920
That's not bad.

33:56.640 --> 33:59.360
J Publish was another popular one, also at 8%.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.400
Jupiter Caster, 11% of the votes.

34:02.400 --> 34:09.200
Pod Pusher, which is very close to what Wimpy and Popey have, came in at 11% of the votes.

34:09.200 --> 34:13.920
But the number two suggestion, which is pretty good, which you could, you know, if you're

34:13.920 --> 34:18.480
thinking about this as an open source project, this might be the better name of the, of,

34:18.480 --> 34:21.200
but, but it's not the one that the people decided.

34:21.840 --> 34:22.480
But I like it.

34:22.480 --> 34:23.600
It's called Autopod.

34:24.240 --> 34:25.280
It's not bad.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.240
Autopod.

34:26.240 --> 34:28.800
It almost sounds like a podcast app on a phone though.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.960
You know, like a cloud box symbol.

34:30.960 --> 34:31.200
Yeah.

34:31.200 --> 34:32.000
Yeah.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.280
Running through Autopod.

34:33.280 --> 34:40.000
Sounds to me, one of those, sorry, Tasker, Alto Tools, the guy names everything literally

34:40.000 --> 34:41.040
Alto something.

34:41.040 --> 34:41.440
Yeah.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.080
True, right?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.280
There's that danger.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.000
Yeah.

34:44.000 --> 34:44.320
Yeah.

34:44.320 --> 34:48.160
So that was, that was, that was, that was there though.

34:48.160 --> 34:48.800
That was number two.

34:48.800 --> 34:53.200
But with 26%, 72 votes, 26% of the vote.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.760
And I think we swung it.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.880
I'm going to, I'll, I'll, I'll own that, but it's Casta Blasta.

34:58.880 --> 35:09.600
Casta Blasta, which is a callback to the very first podcast that myself, Brian and John ever

35:09.600 --> 35:11.600
did before we even formed a network.

35:11.600 --> 35:15.200
We did a show called Casta Blasta together, which was really where we learned how to record

35:15.200 --> 35:17.440
our audio edit and all of that stuff.

35:17.440 --> 35:18.320
Just starting out.

35:18.320 --> 35:18.800
Yeah.

35:18.800 --> 35:24.960
And when we launched Linux action show and Radio Revolver and other shows, Casta Blasta

35:24.960 --> 35:26.880
was still on the air at that time.

35:26.880 --> 35:30.240
So it ran for many years of our origin.

35:30.240 --> 35:34.560
So I think it's kind of fun now that we are fitting part of Linux Academy and we've gone

35:34.560 --> 35:39.280
through all of these evolutions over the years and we're building a system that is really

35:39.280 --> 35:41.840
kind of a serious professional system, right?

35:41.840 --> 35:45.840
There's some, there's some, I dunno, there's something sweet about calling it Casta Blast,

35:45.840 --> 35:50.640
which is when we were so raw and amateur and, and ingested beginning and saying really stupid

35:50.640 --> 35:54.400
stuff into microphones that today you could not say into a microphone, you know, you would

35:54.400 --> 35:59.200
not say those things and we said those things and it was just some other things.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.240
Yeah, it was good stuff.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.320
It was, it was really good.

36:02.320 --> 36:06.560
And so I think it's sort of fitting and it's like, you're blasting it out there too.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.480
So we're going to call it Casta Blasta.

36:08.480 --> 36:14.080
Thank you everyone who did vote and look for more about the Casta Blasta project very soon.

36:14.080 --> 36:18.000
We have, we've taken a page from Microsoft's book where they like, they call the surface

36:18.000 --> 36:19.840
three different things now, you know?

36:19.840 --> 36:21.920
So we're, I guess that's the hip thing to do.

36:21.920 --> 36:26.640
You sound a bit like Mark Wahlberg saying that Casta Blaster.

36:26.640 --> 36:27.680
Casta Blasta.

36:27.680 --> 36:28.240
Yeah, yeah.

36:28.240 --> 36:29.040
Casta Blasta.

36:29.040 --> 36:31.440
That's how he used to say it is Casta Blasta.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.960
You put it through the blaster.

36:32.960 --> 36:38.320
And then last bit of housekeeping before we move on with the show is Linux Fest Northwest

36:38.320 --> 36:44.000
last but absolutely not least, April 26th through the 28th, 2019 at the Bellingham Technical

36:44.000 --> 36:44.720
College.

36:44.720 --> 36:49.120
If you're international or you're around the States, you fly into SeaTac, you can get

36:49.120 --> 36:50.400
shuttles up there.

36:50.400 --> 36:53.840
There are carpools that are forming and Bellingham is beautiful.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.360
The Pacific Northwest is gorgeous.

36:56.000 --> 37:02.160
And the Technical College is one of the better campuses I've ever attended an event on.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.360
Been to a few of these now.

37:03.360 --> 37:09.120
And the great thing about the Technical College is that it's that same place every single

37:09.120 --> 37:09.600
year.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.400
And this is the 20th year of Linux Fest Northwest.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.080
So it's a well oiled machine.

37:14.080 --> 37:17.120
They figured out all the issues you run into the first or second time you're there.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.800
We know where our booth is.

37:18.800 --> 37:19.440
You know where our booth is at.

37:19.440 --> 37:20.160
I know right where it is.

37:20.160 --> 37:21.040
You know right where it's at.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.840
And that's just anyone else who's been there in the past however many years.

37:23.840 --> 37:24.640
It's so nice.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.600
And you know what rooms to go to and you know where the food's going to be at.

37:27.600 --> 37:31.120
And because of that, the lug that puts on the plug that puts this on the Bellingham

37:31.120 --> 37:35.200
Linux Users Group that puts this on can focus on all of the other stuff.

37:35.200 --> 37:38.240
You know, the content, the talks, the great organizations they have.

37:38.240 --> 37:39.120
That's so huge.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.800
And this is their 20th year.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.120
They're doing a theme past, present and future.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.320
We're going to be there.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.600
Joe's flying in.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.160
We're going to try to bring as much of the crew in as we can.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.960
We've got to remember to talk to System76 about doing a party.

37:50.960 --> 37:51.920
Oh, yes.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.600
I'm going to be bringing Lady Joops.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.080
Parking her in the parking lot doing barbecue grilling.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.120
Not barbecuing.

37:57.120 --> 37:57.920
Sorry, Noah.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.600
Grilling for everybody.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.200
If you'll let me put my meat in your mouth, you can come there and eat my meat.

38:03.760 --> 38:04.880
Well, I'm in.

38:04.880 --> 38:05.280
All right.

38:05.280 --> 38:05.760
Very good.

38:05.760 --> 38:06.320
Very good.

38:06.320 --> 38:11.440
So LinuxFestNorthwest.org if you want to check that out and if you're interested in going.

38:12.880 --> 38:16.960
I just say this because I still need to submit talks.

38:16.960 --> 38:17.600
I bet you do too.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.040
We both need to submit our talks.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.920
I'm thinking about doing a talk about Castablasta.

38:22.880 --> 38:26.640
So who can end Castablasta separately possibly or we could do a combo talk.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.600
So we should talk about that.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.400
Yeah, let's talk about that.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.480
And then audio reading on Linux.

38:30.480 --> 38:32.080
You could definitely teach us a thing or two.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.280
Oh, we totally could do.

38:33.280 --> 38:34.800
We could do our Jack segment.

38:34.800 --> 38:35.600
Yeah, that'd be fun.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.480
Why not?

38:36.480 --> 38:37.200
Oh, man.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.320
Because, you know, there's people there.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.480
I already know there's going to be people like how to podcast on Linux.

38:40.480 --> 38:41.920
There's always like two presenters that do that.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.040
And I'm always like, oh, son.

38:44.160 --> 38:45.040
Oh, child.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.360
You know, like I'm always like, oh, yes.

38:47.360 --> 38:48.080
How are you doing?

38:48.080 --> 38:52.160
And I don't mean to be demeaning, but it's always like, no, that's no, no, that's not

38:52.160 --> 38:52.640
going to work.

38:53.200 --> 38:56.160
So we can have a good Q&A session to be so much fun.

38:56.160 --> 39:00.720
Anyways, what I'm getting at is I'm hoping that if we can get enough talks together,

39:01.840 --> 39:06.000
including from somebody that you guys haven't heard of yet and from the people that you

39:06.000 --> 39:10.720
know about on air, maybe we could have a whole dedicated room at Linux Fest Northwest.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.480
That's just the Jupiter broadcasting room.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.760
So that'd be really cool.

39:13.760 --> 39:16.080
Just another reason that this is the this is the year to go.

39:16.080 --> 39:20.160
If you've been thinking about giving talks all day, having a booth, live streaming, doing

39:20.160 --> 39:22.560
a live Linux action news, baby barbecue.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.160
And I mean, it's it's our big get together.

39:24.160 --> 39:27.760
I know it's a big ask to travel that far, but if you can make it and the side benefit

39:27.760 --> 39:30.960
is, you know, even if you end up paying Linux Fest Northwest, which you won't, you won't

39:30.960 --> 39:31.120
know.

39:31.120 --> 39:31.680
Bellingham's great.

39:31.680 --> 39:32.960
The Pacific Northwest is lovely.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.760
So just, you know, you can go on a surprise little summer vacation.

39:35.760 --> 39:36.720
Yeah, early summer.

39:36.720 --> 39:36.960
Yeah.

39:37.840 --> 39:38.080
Yeah.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.240
You know, and come see everybody.

39:40.240 --> 39:43.600
That's always part of the fun is like there's a whole bunch of people there that love talking

39:43.600 --> 39:44.800
about what you're interested in.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.160
And that's just really rewarding.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.400
Anyways, that's all the housekeeping for this week.

39:48.400 --> 39:52.480
So let's move on to our WireGuard in production success story.

39:52.480 --> 39:56.080
So we set up here at the studio on my workstation.

39:56.080 --> 39:58.480
I thought, well, just let's give it a go.

39:58.480 --> 40:02.160
It was one of those projects are like, I'll just I'll just see how hard this is and how

40:02.160 --> 40:03.360
far I can get.

40:03.360 --> 40:05.840
And then I got all the way and I'm like, oh, well, now I've just put this in production

40:05.840 --> 40:06.560
on my workstation.

40:06.560 --> 40:09.040
Oops, but I'll circle back to that.

40:09.040 --> 40:12.400
So WireGuard is a VPN that is built.

40:12.400 --> 40:13.760
Well, is it mainline now?

40:13.760 --> 40:14.960
It is mainline now, right?

40:14.960 --> 40:15.760
In the Linux kernel.

40:15.760 --> 40:17.600
It is now mainline, I believe, in the Linux kernel.

40:17.600 --> 40:21.280
I don't know if it's in kernel 4.15 because you need a DKMS.

40:22.480 --> 40:25.520
You have to build a DKMS module to actually get it to work in 1804.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.680
But I set it up on an 1804 workstation.

40:27.680 --> 40:31.520
There's PPAs available and it just builds super quick and it's installed immediately.

40:32.080 --> 40:37.200
And what you essentially get is the ability to start a new virtual interface.

40:37.200 --> 40:42.080
In a sense, it looks like another network interface on your Linux box and you interact

40:42.080 --> 40:44.160
with it like you would any other interface.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.920
You can assign an IP address.

40:45.920 --> 40:48.560
You can use IP tables to route traffic.

40:48.560 --> 40:51.520
It is like you have another network card in your box.

40:51.520 --> 40:56.240
You create it with IP link and then make a new one and just say, type WireGuard.

40:56.240 --> 40:59.520
Yeah, and then it's up to the kernel to figure out what to do with traffic that's sent and

40:59.520 --> 41:00.960
received to this new interface.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.800
And that's where WireGuard comes in.

41:02.800 --> 41:09.760
And it's so great for somebody like me because I know how to work with network interfaces

41:09.760 --> 41:11.520
and IP tables and all of that.

41:11.520 --> 41:15.120
So within minutes, I had it up and installed.

41:15.120 --> 41:18.160
And then it was like, OK, well, now that I have an interface, I need to route traffic.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.440
So I'm going to set up some IP tables rules to route that traffic.

41:21.440 --> 41:22.400
And it was just obvious.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.160
It was just obvious what the next step was.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.840
That wasn't the hardest part at all for you.

41:25.840 --> 41:27.040
No, no, really.

41:27.040 --> 41:27.520
No, it wasn't.

41:27.520 --> 41:31.600
The hardest part was modifying our Microtech router OS firewall.

41:32.640 --> 41:33.280
That's where I got it.

41:35.360 --> 41:35.920
Go figure.

41:35.920 --> 41:41.520
But no, what I expected to be the hard part was the fact that because I'm apparently a

41:41.520 --> 41:48.720
masochist, I wanted to connect to the WireGuard VPN running on my Ubuntu box from an iPad.

41:48.720 --> 41:51.120
No, well, no, of course you do.

41:51.920 --> 41:52.400
I know.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.360
iOS.

41:53.360 --> 42:00.560
Now, I'll tell you why is so we have the Behringer X32 mixer and it's got a Linux power.

42:00.560 --> 42:01.600
Yeah, it runs Linux.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.280
Our mixer runs Linux.

42:03.280 --> 42:09.440
And it's got a really awesome set of remote control capabilities, so much so that even

42:09.440 --> 42:13.200
the dials and sliders on this mixer are motorized.

42:13.200 --> 42:20.400
So if in software I pull down on a pot line, which is what these are called, the actual

42:20.400 --> 42:27.840
physical slider in the studio moves and they have a touch app for the iPad that happens

42:27.840 --> 42:31.920
to fit the exact amount of channels that we use on the screen.

42:31.920 --> 42:37.600
With real time levels, individual channel control, and if I slide or mute or do anything

42:37.600 --> 42:40.560
on that iPad, it's physically represented in studio.

42:40.560 --> 42:41.280
Oh yeah, it's wild.

42:41.280 --> 42:42.320
It just moves.

42:42.320 --> 42:46.160
Which is great because when you're here sitting in the seat that I normally sit in and you're

42:46.160 --> 42:50.800
sitting in front of the mixer and I'm in Texas, you can actually see me moving sliders.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.000
And you can see me moving though.

42:52.000 --> 42:52.320
Yes.

42:52.320 --> 42:52.960
Both ways.

42:52.960 --> 42:54.400
It's so, so great.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.440
Really nice.

42:55.440 --> 43:00.640
So this is why I wanted to be able to do a WireGuard VPN from the iPad so I could have

43:00.640 --> 43:04.400
touch control of our mixer when I'm remote and I could see everybody's levels.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.760
The mumble room, Wes's, mine, remote hosts, everything.

43:08.640 --> 43:10.400
But iOS is a son of a bitch.

43:10.400 --> 43:13.920
You can't just go to the app store and install a WireGuard app.

43:13.920 --> 43:14.960
That's not a thing.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.480
That's not how it, that's not how.

43:16.480 --> 43:18.080
What do you think this is, Android?

43:18.080 --> 43:18.320
Yeah.

43:18.320 --> 43:19.200
We get a sideload.

43:20.800 --> 43:23.040
You can go screw yourself if you want a sideload.

43:23.040 --> 43:28.960
So the way you have to do it is you have to join the test flight beta for WireGuard.

43:28.960 --> 43:33.280
And there's only a limited amount of slots, but I will have a link in the show notes if

43:33.280 --> 43:34.480
this is something you're interested in.

43:34.480 --> 43:35.200
Get in early.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.520
LinuxUnplugged.com slash 279.

43:38.560 --> 43:45.120
They have been granted a networking stack privilege extension by Apple, where they're

43:45.120 --> 43:48.320
able to do a network level VPN connection.

43:49.040 --> 43:54.560
So it is a true kernel level VPN from the iOS device to my WireGuard system.

43:54.560 --> 44:00.240
And the traffic is then routed to my WireGuard box and I'm able to, my iPad is essentially

44:00.240 --> 44:05.120
on the LAN and it's, I am completely capable of controlling the X32 mixer.

44:05.840 --> 44:06.720
It's just amazing.

44:06.720 --> 44:09.680
It was, I mean, it was really slick when we were playing with it in the studio because

44:10.400 --> 44:13.600
you just, I mean, we just hit like, you tap a button, you tap a button, start it up.

44:13.600 --> 44:14.080
Yeah.

44:14.080 --> 44:15.680
And then it's live and it was latency.

44:15.680 --> 44:16.960
It's so fast too.

44:16.960 --> 44:17.280
Yeah.

44:17.280 --> 44:18.000
It's so fast.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.600
Like the connection is instant and then you wouldn't even know you're going over.

44:21.600 --> 44:25.360
There's like, for what I've done, I've seen very little penalty for the VPN overhead.

44:25.360 --> 44:27.120
It's, it's pretty amazing.

44:28.000 --> 44:32.320
And I think the entire thing took a 30 minute investment.

44:33.520 --> 44:37.200
You know, I asked you, I had to ask you a couple of things because you had done it before.

44:37.200 --> 44:40.960
So I bounced a couple of ideas off of you when I was, what was I, what was I, oh, it

44:40.960 --> 44:42.560
was the remote connection stuff I was troubleshooting.

44:42.560 --> 44:43.060
Yeah.

44:44.080 --> 44:47.360
And once we got that solved with Wes's help, it was just, boom, done.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.160
Wes got router OS into submission and we were good.

44:50.160 --> 44:52.400
There's, there's areas of improvement.

44:52.400 --> 45:00.720
I think, I would like to explore using it for persistent connections between say the

45:00.720 --> 45:05.840
studio in Texas or the studio in Texas and the RV, like maybe a way to like do sort of

45:05.840 --> 45:10.160
like kind of, oh, not a mesh, but almost like a tink style VPN, I don't know.

45:10.160 --> 45:10.660
Yeah.

45:10.660 --> 45:14.960
But like do like a WireGuard connection from the RV to the system in Texas and from the

45:14.960 --> 45:18.800
system in Texas to the studio and from the studio to RV and you know, like do a complete

45:18.800 --> 45:20.880
I don't know, that's something for the future I want to play with.

45:21.600 --> 45:26.560
Also, another thing that should probably happen is I should probably move it off of my work

45:26.560 --> 45:27.600
station in my office.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.160
Maybe pick something a little more permanent.

45:30.160 --> 45:30.660
Yeah.

45:30.660 --> 45:31.280
I was like, but where?

45:31.280 --> 45:34.960
Like I could throw it up in a VM on the free NAS box possibly.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.000
Yeah, that could work.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.560
We also have that dedicated KVM system running CentOS, but it's really old.

45:41.280 --> 45:44.080
It's like when Bitcoin was first released old, that's how old it is.

45:44.080 --> 45:44.720
That's how I measure it.

45:44.720 --> 45:45.220
Okay.

45:45.220 --> 45:46.720
Well, maybe the workstations looking better.

45:46.720 --> 45:51.120
Maybe the workstations looking better and better, but I really and you had it, you were

45:51.120 --> 45:52.240
playing with it off of a droplet.

45:52.240 --> 45:52.960
Oh, yeah, it works great.

45:54.400 --> 46:00.480
The connection establishes so damn fast that I literally do a ping every time just to make

46:00.480 --> 46:02.480
sure it's working because I'm like, how can I connect that fast?

46:02.480 --> 46:06.880
Like I have to like go ping the other machine on the other end just to make sure no way

46:06.880 --> 46:07.440
it's possible.

46:08.160 --> 46:09.040
I was really impressed.

46:09.040 --> 46:09.200
Yeah.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.880
I mean, that's one of the nice features about it, right?

46:10.880 --> 46:15.600
Is the way it doesn't have this kind of older style, really complicated, persistent connection

46:15.600 --> 46:19.200
to do. It's smart enough to just pick up when you when you've got a new one and it picks

46:19.200 --> 46:20.880
up and realizes, oh, hey, you're talking to me.

46:20.880 --> 46:23.840
The public key matches my are you in my allowed IP set?

46:23.840 --> 46:24.560
Yes.

46:24.560 --> 46:24.960
All right.

46:24.960 --> 46:25.360
There you go.

46:25.360 --> 46:26.160
Connection made.

46:26.160 --> 46:26.660
Yeah.

46:27.200 --> 46:34.000
So if you feel like this, I guess it doesn't even there's so many uses for VPNs these days.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.720
I wouldn't even I wouldn't even like put it in any particular box.

46:39.520 --> 46:42.960
But what was the was it Nord VPN that did a commercial?

46:42.960 --> 46:44.320
I think there's several now, but yeah.

46:44.320 --> 46:44.880
Okay.

46:44.880 --> 46:48.880
So it is something WireGuard is something that the commercial VPN providers are starting

46:48.880 --> 46:49.440
to introduce.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.840
So you could play with it that way, too, if you just wanted to mess around with the client

46:51.840 --> 46:52.640
side of it.

46:52.640 --> 46:57.760
But I got to say WireGuard, the WireGuard hype is real and it's pretty great.

46:57.760 --> 47:02.400
And it's pretty easy to get running on a current released version of a Linux distro.

47:02.400 --> 47:05.440
You don't have to wait for it to to show up baked into the kernel.

47:05.440 --> 47:06.640
It's super simple.

47:06.640 --> 47:11.200
How did you guys find that compared to Tink VPN to set up?

47:11.200 --> 47:16.000
Um, it's a it's both simpler and slightly more complicated.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.320
There's a couple things to do in terms of like exchanging keys that it's closer to SSH

47:20.320 --> 47:22.880
and Tink is I guess Tink is about the same.

47:23.600 --> 47:26.320
Does Tink have any GUI front end to set it up?

47:26.320 --> 47:28.240
There might be there might be some I have not used.

47:28.240 --> 47:29.600
Because that scenario WireGuard.

47:29.600 --> 47:34.080
I mean, if there was like a network manager front end to WireGuard, that would be really

47:34.080 --> 47:34.400
great.

47:34.400 --> 47:37.840
I guess I'd have to say it's simpler because it has similar stuff around some of the key

47:37.840 --> 47:39.520
management, WireGuard.

47:39.520 --> 47:43.200
But then you don't have to use the actual, you know, there's no program to run.

47:43.200 --> 47:45.440
You just install the module and then create the interface.

47:45.440 --> 47:46.400
That is really nice.

47:46.400 --> 47:47.360
It's system level.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.160
It's just baked in.

47:48.160 --> 47:53.040
You don't get Tink's magic of, you know, magically making a national connecting peers and all

47:53.040 --> 47:53.520
that stuff.

47:53.520 --> 47:58.160
But it's kind of so in that sense, it's a little more complicated, or it's a lower level

47:58.160 --> 48:00.720
primitive that you could build more elaborate networks with.

48:00.720 --> 48:05.920
I wonder if there could be a like a hosted key sharing system like could keybase, for

48:05.920 --> 48:10.720
example, could could keybase could you add could they could there be like a front end

48:10.720 --> 48:14.560
of WireGuard key exchanging that would make that a little easier because it's got these

48:14.560 --> 48:16.320
it's I like this key system.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.160
I think that's a good way to do it.

48:18.160 --> 48:22.560
But exchanging keys is it's going to be like over email or chat.

48:22.560 --> 48:26.880
And those are vulnerable channels of communication.

48:26.880 --> 48:32.160
So it would be nice if there was like a key base dot IO kind of way to would actually

48:32.160 --> 48:33.280
call fault work.

48:33.280 --> 48:34.400
Maybe I don't know.

48:34.400 --> 48:36.480
I don't know, maybe, maybe I haven't.

48:36.480 --> 48:37.440
That's a good question.

48:37.440 --> 48:37.840
That's sick.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.520
That's that would be interesting.

48:39.520 --> 48:41.840
Either way, very happy with WireGuard.

48:41.840 --> 48:46.800
I'm yeah, I mean, I have a Tink system set up now that all part of it is a backbone from

48:46.800 --> 48:50.080
my parents networks, my home network that I use like so I can get in and troubleshoot

48:50.080 --> 48:50.560
stuff for them.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.160
What do you think you're gonna replace that with WireGuard?

48:52.160 --> 48:52.960
I think so.

48:52.960 --> 48:53.280
Really?

48:53.280 --> 48:53.920
No, why?

48:53.920 --> 48:54.880
Why not stick with Tink?

48:55.600 --> 48:58.000
You know, I wanted to do some maintenance in that system anyway.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.160
And while I've been enjoying Tink, I just don't have that.

49:00.160 --> 49:03.840
I don't have a big enough mesh where I really need that sort of, you know, Tink is great

49:03.840 --> 49:07.840
for creating like one whole new overlay network that you want on top of everything.

49:07.840 --> 49:10.720
But I have more security domains than I want.

49:10.720 --> 49:12.480
You know, I don't want one big one, it turns out.

49:12.480 --> 49:17.840
And yeah, I think WireGuard will be a very low maintenance backbone VPN connection.

49:17.840 --> 49:19.200
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.

49:19.200 --> 49:21.040
Which to be fair, Tink has to I don't ever have to fuss with it.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.080
And it does just work.

49:22.080 --> 49:24.720
But I also see myself using WireGuard more often.

49:24.720 --> 49:28.480
So should I should I need to do any troubleshooting, it'll be fresh in my mind.

49:28.480 --> 49:33.520
Yeah, and it seems like the way of the future, way of the future, way of the future.

49:33.520 --> 49:34.480
I really liked it.

49:34.480 --> 49:37.840
And it's going to be way faster than a lot of the competitors.

49:37.840 --> 49:41.360
And if Apple is allowing it on test flight, then there's a good chance they're going to

49:41.360 --> 49:42.640
allow it in the App Store.

49:42.640 --> 49:46.000
And so there's a really good chance that we're going to have pretty good mobile OS

49:46.000 --> 49:47.440
support for WireGuard.

49:47.440 --> 49:49.680
And I think that's I think that's really, really important.

49:49.680 --> 49:53.360
And the fact that it's so fast means that it's not a big deal for mobile travelers to

49:53.360 --> 49:54.400
just tap it on and go.

49:54.400 --> 49:54.800
Right.

49:54.800 --> 49:58.000
And you've already got stuff like, you know, like a go version of Tink.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.840
Go version, various user land versions.

49:59.840 --> 50:04.080
I heard there was talk about maybe a free BSD kernel version sometime down the way.

50:04.080 --> 50:05.200
No way. Really?

50:05.200 --> 50:05.920
Yeah, maybe.

50:05.920 --> 50:06.240
Maybe.

50:06.240 --> 50:08.160
They already have one imports for the user land stuff, too.

50:08.160 --> 50:10.480
So it's like, yeah, the availability is really climbing.

50:10.480 --> 50:10.640
Yeah.

50:11.200 --> 50:14.400
Well, how about we switch gears and talk about some app picks?

50:14.400 --> 50:14.880
What?

50:14.880 --> 50:16.560
Love the app picks.

50:16.560 --> 50:22.560
Now, I've been I've been on a really slow decline with Reddit.

50:22.560 --> 50:24.480
Like it's been it's been really since.

50:25.680 --> 50:26.320
I don't know.

50:26.320 --> 50:27.280
Two years, three years.

50:27.280 --> 50:27.840
I can't remember.

50:27.840 --> 50:33.120
Like, it's just I don't know, slowly and slowly, I use Reddit less and less.

50:33.120 --> 50:36.800
And I find myself using smaller and smaller subreddits.

50:37.360 --> 50:41.680
So the subreddits that I enjoy the most are the really small ones with like less than

50:41.680 --> 50:43.360
a thousand really focused community.

50:43.360 --> 50:46.560
There's not a lot of room for random trolls to come invade.

50:46.560 --> 50:46.720
Yeah.

50:46.720 --> 50:49.280
When you get above five thousand, I just I don't know.

50:49.280 --> 50:51.200
It starts to turn toxic, I feel like.

50:52.560 --> 50:57.040
But one way that I have been and it's just a visual differentiator.

50:57.040 --> 51:02.400
But one way that I have been processing Reddit a lot easier is on the terminal.

51:02.400 --> 51:05.040
And I've been using an app that's likely in the repo.

51:05.040 --> 51:07.760
I thought you were going to say, I mean, just based on this, you know,

51:07.760 --> 51:10.960
an iPad Pro application, that was the best way to browse Reddit.

51:10.960 --> 51:12.240
No, man, I don't like that.

51:12.240 --> 51:13.600
I don't like the Reddit mobile app.

51:13.600 --> 51:18.640
And I also really freaking hate that when I go to Reddit on the web on a mobile device,

51:18.640 --> 51:21.360
they're like taking up like a solid fourth of the screen.

51:21.360 --> 51:21.680
It's huge.

51:21.680 --> 51:22.880
Yeah, it's very annoying.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.160
A third of the screen, really.

51:24.160 --> 51:25.120
It's a third of the screen.

51:25.120 --> 51:26.720
Almost half of the screen.

51:26.720 --> 51:28.160
They're taking a full screen.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.680
They're taking up your entire screen.

51:30.720 --> 51:33.600
And then there's that annoying nag they put in lately, which is,

51:33.600 --> 51:34.800
do you want to use our mobile?

51:34.800 --> 51:35.760
That's what I'm talking about.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.520
No, no, no, no, I don't.

51:37.520 --> 51:38.720
That's why I'm not using it.

51:38.720 --> 51:39.280
Go away.

51:39.280 --> 51:40.320
That is what I'm talking about.

51:40.320 --> 51:42.880
That thing that takes up basically half the screen.

51:43.760 --> 51:48.960
Three quarters is so annoying and takes up the whole screen where it's come full screen,

51:48.960 --> 51:50.400
full screen, full screen.

51:50.400 --> 51:53.040
It's it's got to go in the meantime, though.

51:53.040 --> 51:58.720
In the meantime, though, if you're on a Linux box, see if you have RTV in your repo.

51:58.720 --> 52:04.160
RTV is a terminal user interface for Reddit that allows logging into your Reddit account.

52:04.160 --> 52:05.680
So you get your subreddits.

52:05.680 --> 52:06.000
I do.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.600
I do have it in my repo.

52:07.600 --> 52:08.000
You do.

52:08.000 --> 52:08.400
You do.

52:08.400 --> 52:08.640
Yeah.

52:09.600 --> 52:13.440
And you can use external tools like it will launch your web browser or it can launch,

52:14.080 --> 52:15.440
you know, like a YouTube player.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.120
It's just a simple.

52:17.840 --> 52:18.800
Oh, it's Python.

52:18.800 --> 52:19.760
It's a Python application.

52:19.760 --> 52:20.240
I thought it was something.

52:20.240 --> 52:21.280
It's a Python application.

52:21.280 --> 52:23.040
It's just a simple Python application.

52:23.040 --> 52:25.440
Browse Reddit has clipboard support.

52:25.440 --> 52:29.120
You can open media links in your preferred media player.

52:29.120 --> 52:31.280
It's got easy navigation through the front page.

52:31.280 --> 52:33.440
You can jump to your favie subreddits.

52:33.440 --> 52:38.080
You can open up specific user pages if you want to, like, go get creepy on a user.

52:38.080 --> 52:39.840
You can browse multi-Reddits.

52:39.840 --> 52:41.200
It's got support for multi-Reddits.

52:41.200 --> 52:42.000
Okay.

52:42.000 --> 52:42.560
And search.

52:43.520 --> 52:44.800
And you can do it all from the command line.

52:45.520 --> 52:50.640
Something about seeing Reddit on the terminal makes it way more palatable for me.

52:50.640 --> 52:51.920
Okay. That was pretty easy.

52:51.920 --> 52:54.480
Now I'm browsing our list from the command line.

52:54.480 --> 52:55.280
Isn't that great?

52:55.280 --> 52:55.440
Yeah.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.600
If you're on Ubuntu, it's in the repo already.

52:57.600 --> 52:59.760
It's on a lot of repos actually.

52:59.760 --> 53:00.720
I think it's in Fedora's too.

53:01.440 --> 53:03.520
So that's pick number one this week.

53:05.040 --> 53:06.720
Now, pick number two.

53:07.360 --> 53:10.800
Pick number two was to replace functionality on a Mac.

53:11.600 --> 53:17.200
The Mac, if you ever dip your toe into the Mac, like we've got, you know,

53:17.200 --> 53:22.160
Final Cut on the Mac here that we used to use, thankfully, that's no longer the thing.

53:23.600 --> 53:25.440
And the occasional Photoshop file.

53:26.000 --> 53:29.680
So, you know, I dabble from time to time.

53:29.680 --> 53:30.880
Haven't had to for a while.

53:31.760 --> 53:35.760
But one of the things that I noticed about the Mac is they got all these little one-off

53:35.760 --> 53:38.320
applications like we have on Linux for everything.

53:39.040 --> 53:41.600
But they're all like pay-for applications.

53:41.600 --> 53:42.080
Of course.

53:42.080 --> 53:43.120
They're all like five bucks, ten bucks.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.200
They've got that healthy app store, Chris.

53:45.200 --> 53:46.400
Yeah, they sure do.

53:46.400 --> 53:49.200
Actually, it's struggling, but they still like to charge for everything.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.480
But on the Linux side, a lot of the stuff is free.

53:53.120 --> 53:56.800
It's something we don't talk a lot about, maybe because, you know, we want people to

53:56.800 --> 54:01.200
make money and we want them to be able to, you know, make money making software.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.240
Like that's the thing we all want.

54:03.120 --> 54:06.720
But there's so much shit that you get for free besides just the desktop.

54:06.720 --> 54:07.920
There's so much stuff.

54:08.560 --> 54:11.600
And some of this stuff the Mac users have no idea about.

54:11.600 --> 54:14.320
This is one of them you can really rub in their face because this is hard to get on

54:14.320 --> 54:18.000
the Mac that's decent quality that isn't at least 20 bucks.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.080
And you may have heard of it, but I got to tell you about it.

54:20.080 --> 54:23.760
It's called Sound Converter, and it's perfect for my workflow.

54:23.760 --> 54:27.120
And Sound Converter is exactly what it sounds like.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.120
It's an easy way to set up a preset.

54:29.120 --> 54:32.080
You drop some files in there, you hit go, and it converts them all to that.

54:32.640 --> 54:37.600
Which, as Wes probably has already guessed, is great for our production flow here because

54:37.600 --> 54:41.440
we can record in a multitrack editor and huge WAV files.

54:41.440 --> 54:46.320
And then I can drop all these WAV files in Sound Converter, it spits them out as mono

54:46.320 --> 54:48.640
FLAC files and sends them off to Joe.

54:48.640 --> 54:49.440
Boom.

54:49.440 --> 54:50.000
Done.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.360
And it's the same thing like if you want to convert a whole bunch of stuff to Ogg Vorbis

54:53.360 --> 54:56.240
or MP3, you just drop them all in here and you hit go.

54:56.240 --> 54:59.760
It saves you from writing out this whole complicated command line syntax.

54:59.760 --> 55:02.480
And the batch support sounds pretty nice there.

55:02.480 --> 55:06.480
And it has the benefit of giving you a GUI to expose all the options you might possibly

55:06.480 --> 55:10.080
use, which is always really nice when you're getting started with conversion of media.

55:10.080 --> 55:12.160
You don't even know always what you can do.

55:12.160 --> 55:16.560
And this has the option of doing resample or, like in my case, dropping it to mono.

55:17.280 --> 55:22.080
It has the option of transcoding to a different format if it can or just copying it if it's

55:22.080 --> 55:23.360
going to the same format.

55:23.360 --> 55:26.400
I like that Opus is a handy default input right there.

55:26.400 --> 55:27.040
Yeah.

55:27.040 --> 55:29.360
And it basically supports everything.

55:29.360 --> 55:33.040
I'm sure it's just using FFmpeg and a bunch of other great stuff under the hood, but

55:34.240 --> 55:35.600
Honey Badger over here, I don't care.

55:35.600 --> 55:39.600
This is just a great way to use it because I can go from the file manager, boom, I hit

55:39.600 --> 55:43.680
start, it puts it right in the directory I want, that syncs up to Joe, and I'm done.

55:43.680 --> 55:47.840
And it's just so nice because there was an application on the Mac that used to do that

55:47.840 --> 55:50.240
and it was legitimately like $20.

55:50.240 --> 55:52.960
And I just see that kind of stuff.

55:52.960 --> 55:59.200
And I'm just overwhelmingly appreciative of how enabling open source software can be

55:59.200 --> 56:05.040
for people that don't have immaculate, huge, ginormous Uncle Scrooge sized budgets.

56:05.040 --> 56:05.920
That's a really good point, right?

56:05.920 --> 56:10.320
Because sometimes we're talking from the perspective of professionals or business or

56:10.320 --> 56:12.400
just high end people at home.

56:12.400 --> 56:14.880
And that's very different from sort of the baseline.

56:14.880 --> 56:17.360
What should you be able to do with a computer for free?

56:18.560 --> 56:20.480
If you just install this, you get that.

56:20.480 --> 56:25.920
And because there's so many options, it's easy to forget how valuable that is.

56:26.960 --> 56:30.400
But when I switched over to the Mac and I'm like, I mean, this is something I could do

56:30.400 --> 56:30.800
for free?

56:30.800 --> 56:32.160
You're telling me I got to spend $20?

56:32.160 --> 56:33.280
This is ridiculous.

56:33.280 --> 56:34.880
And I was incensed by it.

56:34.880 --> 56:39.360
And then it's like, I have lost that appreciation for just how much comes with Linux

56:39.360 --> 56:42.080
that is just totally free besides the desktop itself.

56:42.080 --> 56:45.040
And I feel like the conversation is always around the value of the desktop.

56:45.040 --> 56:48.880
But it's really, it's the entire ecosystem, right?

56:48.880 --> 56:53.200
It's the applications, it's the support, it's all of it that's free.

56:53.200 --> 56:54.320
And that's huge.

56:54.320 --> 56:56.400
So, and this is just one of those great applications.

56:57.360 --> 56:57.920
You can get it.

56:57.920 --> 57:00.320
We'll have a link in the show notes, linuxunplugged.com

57:00.320 --> 57:04.720
slash 279 and go there and get links to everything we talked about.

57:04.720 --> 57:06.880
There's also the contact page there.

57:06.880 --> 57:10.480
If you would like to send us some of your feedback, we have the subscribe link there.

57:10.480 --> 57:13.600
If you want to get this show every single week, and we encourage that.

57:13.600 --> 57:19.760
Just around the corner is our predictions episode and our roundup and look back.

57:19.760 --> 57:21.600
And our future casting is what I'm going to call it.

57:21.600 --> 57:26.000
Where we, if we had a magic wand, if we could just make something happen, where,

57:26.000 --> 57:30.560
we're not constrained by the sad bounds of reality.

57:30.560 --> 57:31.920
No, no, no.

57:31.920 --> 57:35.840
And of course, it's a great opportunity for you to get involved in that virtual lug.

57:35.840 --> 57:37.840
Give us your predictions and all of that.

57:37.840 --> 57:41.360
So we'll do one the day after Christmas, Wednesday the 26th.

57:41.360 --> 57:42.320
Escape your family.

57:42.320 --> 57:43.680
You're tired of visiting with them.

57:43.680 --> 57:45.040
Come hang out with us.

57:45.040 --> 57:45.920
You got a hangover.

57:45.920 --> 57:48.320
Just sit in your chair and chat in our mumble room and future cast.

57:48.320 --> 57:50.160
Eggnog is welcome and allowed.

57:50.160 --> 57:53.040
The day after New Year's, we'll have a show then too.

57:53.040 --> 57:54.800
And you can make your predictions, get it on the record.

57:54.800 --> 57:57.760
And I have been keeping a list of predictions and checking it twice.

57:57.760 --> 58:00.560
And I'm feeling really good about my predictions this year.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.720
I think it's my best year ever of predictions.

58:02.720 --> 58:03.520
So you better get started.

58:03.520 --> 58:04.240
Oh boy.

58:04.240 --> 58:05.600
Don't get, this is, this is tough.

58:05.600 --> 58:07.840
Go get more Wes over at TechSnap.Systems.

58:07.840 --> 58:08.800
Thank you for joining us.

58:08.800 --> 58:10.080
And we'll see you right back here.

58:10.080 --> 58:26.080
Next Tuesday.

58:40.080 --> 58:48.560
The Unplugged Show.

58:49.200 --> 58:49.760
There we go.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.120
$279 in the can.

58:51.680 --> 58:53.360
Let's go pick our title.

58:53.360 --> 58:55.120
And Mr. Payne, without further ado.

58:57.120 --> 58:58.400
How's that keyboard over there?

58:59.040 --> 58:59.440
Uh oh.

58:59.440 --> 59:02.320
It's not quite in flames.

59:02.320 --> 59:02.480
Yeah.

59:02.480 --> 59:03.760
It doesn't look like it's on fire right now.

59:03.760 --> 59:08.080
We're having a little bit of a compilation error that I'm working through right now.

59:08.080 --> 59:08.320
All right.

59:08.320 --> 59:09.120
Well, you got to post show.

59:09.120 --> 59:12.320
But I guess there's a lot of C++ here to go through.

59:12.320 --> 59:14.240
I feel like you do well under pressure.

59:14.240 --> 59:15.040
You'll get this.

59:15.040 --> 59:15.360
All right.

59:15.360 --> 59:19.760
We'll check back in with Wes Payne and how he's doing on getting his keyboardio on fire.

59:20.320 --> 59:22.000
We have to also pick our title.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.960
So we still have, we still have some housekeeping to get to.

59:24.960 --> 59:26.240
Thank you, Mumble Room.

59:26.240 --> 59:27.360
Always enjoy having you guys.

59:27.360 --> 59:28.960
Why are Guardians of the Galaxy?

59:28.960 --> 59:30.400
That is good.

59:30.400 --> 59:30.960
Yeah.

59:30.960 --> 59:31.600
Yeah, I agree.

59:32.160 --> 59:32.720
Yeah.

59:32.720 --> 59:34.160
What does that have to do with anything?

59:34.160 --> 59:35.040
Where'd that come from?

59:37.040 --> 59:38.480
Why, why a god?

59:38.480 --> 59:39.440
Oh, WireGuard.

59:39.440 --> 59:39.920
I see.

59:39.920 --> 59:41.040
Ah, I see.

59:41.040 --> 59:41.920
Come on.

59:41.920 --> 59:43.120
Oh, I see.

59:43.120 --> 59:44.640
You just heard the Galaxy.

59:44.640 --> 59:45.040
I did.

59:45.040 --> 59:45.680
Yeah.

59:45.680 --> 59:48.160
Dar, are you on the Dex doc again this week?

59:48.160 --> 59:49.040
Yes, I am.

59:49.040 --> 59:50.160
You maniac.

59:50.160 --> 59:51.280
You maniac.

59:52.080 --> 59:54.720
Well, I am doing a Tora experiment.

59:54.720 --> 59:59.280
So yeah, I'm like, I'm also using the iConnect headphones.

59:59.280 --> 01:00:04.720
So, ah, I also like embarrassing and embarrassing.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.600
That's pretty good.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:09.120
WireGuardians of the Galaxy, those really great.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.680
Man, we have some, those are some good ones.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.600
MB Aerosine is also pretty good.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.560
It's hard to say though.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.960
Micro K8s on Ubuntu.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.320
I no longer MB you.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.600
I like you.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.720
I no longer MB you.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.080
This is, this is the good one.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.880
Oh, does anybody, okay.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:27.200
All right.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.720
Does anybody have any travel hacks for me?

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.000
Doing a lot of travel these days.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.080
You guys have any tips to make travel easier?

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.200
Have you got one of those little,

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.000
what's it called?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.520
Little, I've got this on my desk here.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.920
It's a little travel router, smart router,

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.200
and it runs open WRT or something.

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.360
And it connects to hotel wifi.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.200
So you do the captive portal once and then all your devices

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.600
are magic, like a Chromecast just works.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.400
It's great.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.400
I have been thinking more and more about that

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.480
because I could also WireGuard from that, right?

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.240
So that could establish a WireGuard connection

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.040
back to the studio.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.600
Yeah.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.160
Yeah.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:00:59.600
And that could be extremely useful.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.840
And I could just route the 192 network over there.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:07.760
So I used it in the summer when I was over to get BBC iPlayer in America.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.800
So I just VPN back to England using that little box.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.360
It's great.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:11.920
Hmm.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.920
Is it a GLI neat one?

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:19.040
Yes, I have the GLMT300N.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.880
GLI stuff is great.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:23.440
Realms open WRT right out of the box.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.560
They don't do too much.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.520
They do it their own custom interface, but that's not too bad.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.040
Could you, you should throw a link.

01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:29.520
Yeah.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.680
I have like three of them.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.160
Link it up.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.600
Put it in the chat room.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:39.280
So this is just open WRT have like a capacity for like connecting to my files too.

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.880
And what about the double net issue?

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.080
Badger, do you have issues with double net when you do this?

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.160
It will repeat Wi-Fi just fine.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:50.080
And double net, I don't know because I'm only ever going outbound

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.480
because I'm usually where the thing is.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.920
So I haven't tried.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.440
I'm worried about that too much.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:56.080
Sorry.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.040
I got to check this out.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.080
We got to link this up.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.960
Because this could be, this could be nice.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.280
The other thing that we were playing with is a little project called iodine.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:09.360
And this has been fun.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:09.600
Yeah.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.200
This has a lot of potential.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:16.800
Iodine allows you to, and correct me if I'm wrong, tunnel TCP traffic over DNS.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:17.760
Yep.

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.480
Try out SSH Shuttle for that.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.080
It's much easier to set up.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.440
It just works over SSH.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.680
I'll look into this too, SSH Shuttle.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.600
SSH Shuttle.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.760
But the nice thing about iodine is it's, it has,

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:34.640
DNS has to work for a lot of these captive portals to work.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.960
So if you're on a network that has a captive portal,

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.840
in order for the page to load, DNS is likely working.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.360
And so you can exploit that to get access to the internet

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.640
without having to accept the captive portal, which I think has a lot of potential.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.160
It is not super fast.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.320
You can hope for maybe like 200 kilobits per second or something.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.680
Yeah, it's, it's straight up.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.080
Is it, is it Shuttle with two S's or is it?

01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:58.480
Yeah.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.640
I just dropped a link into IRC for you.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.120
Okay.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:01.600
All right.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.000
All right.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.320
All right.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.280
This is happening.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.880
We're, we're getting down on all of this.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:11.040
So iodine has the potential to keep me connected in situations,

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.920
maybe like when I'm in the air that I normally couldn't be connected

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:19.360
for text messaging and email and IRC and Slack and telegram.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.320
Not live streaming.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.960
No, not for, not for Netflix or anything like that.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.600
Yeah.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.800
I did see somebody trying to watch Netflix on the airplane on the flight back.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:27.280
Oh really?

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.200
How did that go for them?

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.000
Cause I phone those connections to vary a lot.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.760
I don't, I don't, I didn't watch closely.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.120
The trick is you download man.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:40.560
That's why Netflix on mobile devices allows you to download content before you travel.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:41.760
Maybe they downloaded.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:42.480
That might be it.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.840
Maybe they downloaded.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.560
Yeah.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.960
So S Shuttle, is that, is that what I'm looking for here?

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.120
Yeah.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:47.600
This looks.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.560
SSH.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:48.880
Yeah.

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.120
Yeah.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:49.600
S Shuttle.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.560
I suppose it is.

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.000
I've just put some aliases in the, uh, IRC for you too.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.760
So it puts think the paid file up so you can run it as a demon in the background.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.760
So very, very nice.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.000
Yeah.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.240
Transparent proxy server that works as a poor man's VPN forwards over SSH.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.200
Doesn't require admin.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.440
Supports DNS tunneling.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:10.000
That's great.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.920
I didn't, I've used it for just the regular stuff, but I didn't know it had the DNS component.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.320
DNS tunneling could be pretty, pretty great.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.440
I, uh, it's in the, uh, it's in the repo too.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:19.840
Hmm.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:22.080
So it's a pretty low barrier of entry here.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.440
I'll put a link to this in the show notes.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.120
I think this is also worth checking out.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.000
Thank you, sir.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.040
That's a good travel hack.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:27.280
Yeah.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.480
So that's the kind of stuff I'm talking about.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.360
I like this stuff.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.360
I use it to get around corporate firewalls.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:38.000
So your mileage, cause you can put SSH on port four, four, three, and then use corkscrew to

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.560
tunnel your SSH through on port four, four, three.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.440
So most proxies can't tell the difference between that and SSH traffic.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.080
So right.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:47.200
Yeah.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.440
And, um, that's the thing about DNS tunneling is like, they can't shut down DNS or else that

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.320
breaks a lot of stuff.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.200
So they're kind of stuck.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.720
DNS is sort of essential for all this to work.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:00.320
So that's what's great about being able to tunnel over DNS is sort of the gotcha, uh,

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.200
the gotcha maneuver.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:01.760
Hmm.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.200
Well, um, I like that.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.080
Thank you.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.440
I'll take a look into all of that.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.720
If anybody else has any travel tips, uh, travel hack tips.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:08.960
Yeah.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.640
We can all get by better together.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.120
Yeah.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:11.440
Yeah.

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.560
At Chris Elias.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:16.400
Oh, uh, Badger, it looks like J6 is saying in the, uh, chat room that there's actually

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.720
a system D service, uh, for S shuttle too.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.920
So that could be the way to go.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:20.240
Yeah.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.120
Can imagine there is.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.840
All right, Mr.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.720
Payne, it's the last check-in of the show.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.640
How are we doing over there?

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.560
How is the keyboardio treating you?

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:30.960
Okay.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.600
Well, I, I was able to build the clean firmware for the keyboard.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.080
Okay.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.560
Now I haven't tested it yet, so we can do that.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.360
Oh, really?

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.600
So you've rebuilt the entire firmware?

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:42.100
Yes.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.920
Oh my goodness.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.080
And, and you're about to deploy it to the keyboard?

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:46.720
Oh, wow.

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.200
We certainly, I mean, that's the next step.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.240
Now it doesn't have the plugin modifications.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.800
Oh, that's going to be the, that'll be the trick after this.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.400
Assuming, assuming this works.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.120
All right, let's do it.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.640
So let's, uh, let's send that new interface over.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:04.880
So this firmware, by the way, so it goes, the interface is USB-C, but the keyboards

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.200
themselves are actually in two pieces combined together.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.400
Look like butterfly wings.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:12.960
And they're connected with what seems to be an ethernet cable between the two different

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:18.080
keyboards, Wes Payne plugging it in right now, getting ready to deploy the new keyboardio

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:18.480
firmware.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.520
Yeah, let's see here.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:25.440
Custom firmware for a custom keyboard with beautiful mechanical key switches,

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:32.160
a nice maple wood enclosure and Linux firmware inside the hardware.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:32.880
All right, Wes.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.380
All right.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.320
Um, I mean, it's kind of anticlimactic.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:38.800
It is, right?

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.400
Well, there's a lot of steps here.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:40.640
Okay.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.560
You know what, you know, what we'll have to say is, uh, I guess tune in next week to find

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.040
out if it works.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:45.200
Right.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:48.800
Tune in next week where I'll be exclusively using the keyboardio.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.240
Really?

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.560
Do we get that handy dandy music again next week?

01:06:52.560 --> 01:07:10.560
Yes.
