1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
All right, Wes Payne, I want you to take a guess.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,340
What is the average miles per hour in which you exhale air?

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,040
So the speed at which it leaves your hot bod?

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,180
Fourteen? Fourteen. What do you say, Cheese?

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,680
Is it sneeze or is that just regular exhale?

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,220
I think a sneeze is probably, like, pedal to the metal.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,320
So I say regular.

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,420
That's a special case, yeah.

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,160
Okay, so I'm gonna say 27 miles an hour.

10
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,460
Whoa, okay. All right, what about you, Drew?

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,660
I'm gonna go way lower.

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,960
I'm gonna say, like, three miles per hour.

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,360
He's a real slow breather, that's true.

14
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,460
He's a smoker, maybe.

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,560
Yeah. Anybody in the Mumble Room have a guess?

16
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,660
Fifteen.

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,940
Jill says 15.

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,600
All right, are you ready for the big reveal?

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,180
Are you ready? Are you ready?

20
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,940
I've never wanted anything more.

21
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,780
It is 15 miles per hour!

22
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,880
Whoo!

23
00:00:44,880 --> 00:01:01,300
Hello, friends, and welcome into a very special edition of 357.

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,300
My name is Chris.

25
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,300
My name is Wes.

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,940
I don't know how we got into this, Wes,

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,700
but we are here on a Sunday with our virtual lug

28
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,980
recording a special edition of the show

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,680
while I am on the road.

30
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,140
It's a bake-off, which we don't tend

31
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,940
to get into, but on this episode,

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,020
we each went off and took a lightweight Linux distribution

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,720
with us, and we're gonna come back and, A,

34
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,960
tell you what we thought about it,

35
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,560
but, B, we created a point system,

36
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,200
which I'll tell you about here in a moment,

37
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,220
in which to score them, and we'll see who walks away

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,960
with the ultimate lightweight distribution.

39
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,640
So to help Wes and I do that, of course,

40
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,000
is our two Robins.

41
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,740
It's Drew and Cheese. Hello, gentlemen.

42
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,740
Hello.

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,740
Hello.

44
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,740
I think that Drew, you went for the more retro Robin,

45
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,120
and Cheese went for the more modern movie Robin.

46
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,440
Skimpy, that's for sure.

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,980
Yeah, Cheese, I'm not sure.

48
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,360
I think that was a Robin costume for ladies.

49
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,520
Hey, you don't be dissin' my cute-ass Robin costume.

50
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,360
It looks good.

51
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,320
It looks good, you know?

52
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,720
I just gotta say, it looks good.

53
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,460
And then, of course, all-wearing costume

54
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,520
is our virtual lug.

55
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,360
Hello, Mumble Room.

56
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,660
Time-appropriate greetings.

57
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,500
Hello.

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,960
Happy Linux Tuesday recorded on a Sunday.

59
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,940
Happy Sunday.

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,280
Yeah, this is a special one.

61
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,140
We just took over the virtual lug today with no heads up,

62
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,180
because this is the last MINNA idea we had.

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,140
Sorry, MINNY.

64
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,340
Sorry, guys.

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,940
But we wanted to get you in on this as well.

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,120
We thought, why not?

67
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,220
Let's have some fun talking about

68
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,680
lightweight distributions.

69
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,660
I think lightweight distributions hold a special part

70
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,320
in all of our hearts.

71
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,760
I think the first one that I really took seriously

72
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,800
was probably back in the Lubuntu 1010 days, which back then

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,940
included LXDE and was really nice for systems

74
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,640
that were single-core processors before the domination

75
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,540
of multi-core and tons and tons of RAM.

76
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,340
I ran it on a system with 128 megabytes of RAM.

77
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,380
And I think it was a Pentium 3.

78
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,580
It was a really old system at the time.

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,220
I mean, it just brings back some of that magic of, yeah,

80
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,120
you can make Linux work on that when whatever proprietary OS

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,020
came on it is no longer supported.

82
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,360
There's that.

83
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,460
It's like bringing life into a system, which feels incredible.

84
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,000
But it's also a special challenge

85
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,560
that not every distribution decides to take on,

86
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,240
because it's not necessarily an easy goal to fit

87
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,140
within these tiny constraints.

88
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,280
Mind those dependencies.

89
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,240
Especially when you want yourself a modern desktop.

90
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,320
So we set off to define a few rules around the game

91
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,580
and award some points.

92
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,480
Now, because this is a special edition, gentlemen,

93
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,580
the floor is open for you to ask any questions about the rules

94
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,620
or make any suggestions, because we're doing this as we go.

95
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,400
But we had some minimum requirements that will

96
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
earn your distribution a point.

97
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,860
So you need to be responsible for tracking your points here.

98
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,540
Do you guys have something?

99
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,840
I got paper right here.

100
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,400
What, are you asking us to tally our own points?

101
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,700
Because I'm going to give myself a winning number, so.

102
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,340
Bring your own tally.

103
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,040
The audience will be keeping count,

104
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,140
and they will hold you accountable.

105
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,380
So you'll get one point if you can run it on a single CPU

106
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,380
core, if you can run it with one gig of RAM,

107
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,880
you get a point for each of these, I think.

108
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,720
What do you think?

109
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,020
You like doing it that way?

110
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Or do you think you should just get one point for all of them?

111
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,560
No, I like splitting them up.

112
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,400
All right, so these are one pointers.

113
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,400
One CPU, one gigabyte of RAM, within a gigabyte

114
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,500
of hard drive space, easy dark mode, and easy to install.

115
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,900
And you must be able to run a web browser that

116
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,840
can play any episode of LUP in the browser.

117
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,240
So that is for one point.

118
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,220
If you get one point for each of those.

119
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,340
All right.

120
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,920
Now, the bonus round, where each one of these

121
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,580
is awarded five points, if you can get a modern GTK

122
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,720
or cute theme on there, and I define that in here as ARK,

123
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,620
YARU, POP, or Breeze, if you can install software that is not

124
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,600
in the distribution's repos, so somehow get software

125
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,360
from outside the repos running on the box,

126
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,640
that is also worth five points.

127
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,740
Another five points if you can play YouTube or Netflix

128
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,340
in your browser.

129
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,980
And if you can boot to the desktop within 20 seconds,

130
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,440
another five points.

131
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:13,620
And if any video game at all plays, five points.

132
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,620
All right.

133
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,320
Not a lot of points, but some of these

134
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,520
are slightly challenging.

135
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,860
Some of these distros, it may be harder to get ARK or YARU

136
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,660
or POP on there.

137
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,660
Sure.

138
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,820
The modern GTK theme, is that out of the box?

139
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,420
Or is that something that you can install after?

140
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,360
I think it's fair if you can get it after.

141
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,160
I think that's fair.

142
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,160
Do you guys agree with that?

143
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:30,660
Agreed.

144
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,160
Agreed.

145
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,760
Yeah.

146
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,960
OK, all right.

147
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,160
Because I mean, honestly, at this level,

148
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,800
you're the type of user that's OK doing that.

149
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,540
All right, then we have the illumination round,

150
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,800
which is 10 points for each one of these.

151
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,380
You get 10 points if you can get it to run Visual Studio code.

152
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,240
Just thought that'd be a fun one.

153
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,320
And 10 points if you can get it to install

154
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,920
a different kernel than the one that it shipped with,

155
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,520
and it still boots.

156
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,380
So 10 points for that.

157
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,820
And then we have the will of the people round.

158
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,860
An additional 10 points will be awarded just for one thing.

159
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,560
If you convince a co-host, each co-host

160
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,800
you convince that your distro is the best,

161
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,540
you can be awarded 10 points.

162
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,860
Yeah, OK.

163
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,100
Y'all turncoats.

164
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,440
I mean, this is, I think, a chance

165
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,000
where if your distribution can't meet

166
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,880
some of these other minimums, you

167
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,980
could make it up in the will of the people round.

168
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,740
It's the personality factor.

169
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,180
So we hit the randomize button, and we're

170
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,780
each distributed a distribution, which

171
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,980
I now am, of course, a main advocate for.

172
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,660
Drew was distributed Bunsen Labs, Cheese, Puppy Linux,

173
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,600
Wes, FreeBSD, and what was the other one, Wes?

174
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,860
Well, this was a late contender I added to the race

175
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,160
because it was just too fun.

176
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,700
OK, so FreeBSD is going to be my main contender.

177
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,540
But Calibri OS is written in pure assembly

178
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,940
and needs only something like eight megs of RAM.

179
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,080
So I thought, why not go super tiny?

180
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,540
Now, it's not going to score very well,

181
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,440
but I thought it deserved an amendment.

182
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,140
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to hearing about that,

183
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,480
and FreeBSD.

184
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,880
And then I was assigned Sparky Linux,

185
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,060
which I'm looking forward to telling you about because

186
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,860
obviously, it is the best Linux out of all of these

187
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,500
and should clearly be the winner.

188
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,460
And by the end of this, you'll all want to run it.

189
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,360
So we'll talk about that.

190
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,900
These are the ground rules.

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,600
It's a little complicated, but it's essentially

192
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,380
there is a one-point category, a five-point category,

193
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,580
and a 10-point category.

194
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,580
And then there is that final will of the people category

195
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,640
that's also 10 points, just one item.

196
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,880
And that is convince a co-host.

197
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,180
So what do you say we start with Bunsen Labs?

198
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,220
Drew, I'm curious to know about Bunsen Labs

199
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,620
and why we should all be using it.

200
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,960
First of all, it is so Debian that you can switch to it

201
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,520
from a base Debian system.

202
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,520
Oh, wow.

203
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,520
OK.

204
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,360
Bunsen Labs Helium, you can get as a PPA

205
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,640
and convert your current Debian system into Bunsen Labs.

206
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,540
So what does that mean?

207
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,980
First of all, you have the full power of Debian behind you.

208
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,140
So this is going to score very, very, very highly

209
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,080
on this test.

210
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,280
Talk's a big game.

211
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,480
Oh, I do.

212
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,520
And rightly so.

213
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,980
I ran it on one core and one gig of RAM.

214
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,880
No problem whatsoever.

215
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,180
Yeah, but this thing's based on Debian 9.

216
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,360
Snore.

217
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,800
Wah, wah, wah.

218
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,100
Oh, well.

219
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,220
If I'm deploying systems all over left and right,

220
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,260
I want something modern.

221
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,700
I want like Debian 10.

222
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,340
Yeah, but I can still get back ports through PPAs.

223
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,940
OK, all right.

224
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,300
I was not really able to get it to install

225
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,280
with one gigabyte of disk.

226
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,840
Just to get it to properly install and be

227
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,380
able to run updates afterwards, I had to go to five gigabytes.

228
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,340
But I would recommend going to 10 gig

229
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,820
for a fully functional system.

230
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,620
So losing a point there, but.

231
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,880
OK, did anybody else get in within the one gig?

232
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,260
Did anybody get the one gig point?

233
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,160
Not quite.

234
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,120
Not with the GUI, although Calibri OS totally does.

235
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,060
Yeah, I got to admit, I did not quite get there either.

236
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,060
I got really close.

237
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,340
And none of us got the one gig point.

238
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,140
But Drew, did you get the one CPU core?

239
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Oh, absolutely.

240
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,800
All right, so mark yourself a point down for that.

241
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,640
What about how much RAM?

242
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,640
One gig.

243
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,600
All right, so you get a point for that.

244
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,580
How was the install to disk?

245
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,920
Install to disk was fine as soon as I had a big enough disk.

246
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,980
Right, OK, tell us about that.

247
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,980
Super easy.

248
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,660
So it has an install to disk option in the grub menu.

249
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,960
And it launches into a nice, easy installer.

250
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,800
It explains everything as you're going,

251
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,360
and tells you exactly what it's doing,

252
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,600
and asks you simple questions that you

253
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,900
can decide on how to proceed.

254
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,140
It is fine with just the default options.

255
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,500
I didn't change a single thing, and had

256
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,580
zero problems going through the entire installation.

257
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,480
OK, I got to admit, early on, I'm feeling a little concerned.

258
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,020
Are you feeling competitive right now, Cheese?

259
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,380
Nah.

260
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,260
Yeah, OK, all right, OK.

261
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,160
Damn it, Debian.

262
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,220
So what about easy dark mode?

263
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,460
No, there was no dark mode out of the box.

264
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,160
I'm not going to give myself a point for that.

265
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,200
I could get a dark mode going to the repos

266
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,060
and downloading something, but I feel

267
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,440
like the easy dark mode should be out of the box.

268
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,740
So I'm going to say no.

269
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,500
OK, I think we all agree on that.

270
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,800
I am curious, is there any special sauce

271
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,440
you really liked about it to keep things light?

272
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,540
I mean, if you've got the full power of Debian,

273
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,320
are they doing anything different about how

274
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,180
they set up defaults, or just tune things to keep it small?

275
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,860
Aside from just using Openbox as the window manager,

276
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,760
I don't know what special things they're doing on the back end

277
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,600
to make it run so light.

278
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,700
But the default install is literally

279
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,440
it's just Openbox on a Debian-based system

280
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,800
with kernel 4.9 and it has Firefox ESR instead

281
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,700
of the latest stable.

282
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,440
Aside from that, it doesn't appear

283
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,540
that there's any specific kernel tuning or anything

284
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,680
like that that is really making it so light.

285
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,980
I think it's just the fact that Debian

286
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,860
doesn't need much to begin with.

287
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,060
And neither does Openbox.

288
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,520
Really, it doesn't, yeah.

289
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,200
So did you get a rough idea of what you're just sort

290
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,860
of sitting idle RAM usage was?

291
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,300
Very, very low.

292
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,060
I didn't specifically calculate it,

293
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,260
but it wasn't even really showing up

294
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,400
in my virtual machine manager.

295
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,280
I know.

296
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,480
That's what's so funny about this, huh?

297
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
These things are so lightweight,

298
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
you don't even really notice them.

299
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,940
All right, well, let's get into the bonus round here.

300
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,780
So did it have a modern theme?

301
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,520
Not out of the box, but it's Debian.

302
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,920
So any theme you could, OK.

303
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,480
I think you get five points for that then.

304
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,480
I do.

305
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,760
Were you able to install any software that

306
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,120
wasn't in the repos?

307
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,720
I installed software from PPAs, and I also

308
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,020
compiled from source.

309
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,820
Oh, snap.

310
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,060
All right, total five points.

311
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,860
Were you able to play YouTube or Netflix?

312
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,940
I was able to play YouTube on the live CD version,

313
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,540
and I was able to get into Netflix after installing

314
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,540
the DRM in Firefox.

315
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,080
But unfortunately, it crashed while I

316
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,380
was trying to play Netflix.

317
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,080
However, after I installed it to disk, no problems whatsoever.

318
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,660
Netflix worked without even skipping a beat.

319
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,220
Now, I'm betting, because it is Debian-based,

320
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,560
you probably didn't get to the desktop in under 20 seconds.

321
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,160
Actually, on the very first boot,

322
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,160
I got to the desktop in 26.8 seconds.

323
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,240
However, after that, on any subsequent boot,

324
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,640
seven seconds on the dot.

325
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,640
Whoa.

326
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,840
Really?

327
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,940
All right, I think you get five points for that.

328
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,140
Any video games?

329
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,120
Yeah, I loaded up a few simple games,

330
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,220
because I was running in a virtual machine,

331
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,920
and I didn't have any kind of real DRM

332
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,220
or any kind of access to the video card.

333
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,800
I wasn't going to try anything like super snazzy,

334
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,760
but I was playing Xtron, I'll Riot, Xboard.

335
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,840
Stuff's in Debian, so.

336
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,940
So you got every category.

337
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,340
You got every one of those in the five points category.

338
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,080
All right, now to the elimination round.

339
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,380
Each one of these is 10 points.

340
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,280
Does it run Visual Studio Code?

341
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,280
I'm assuming, yes.

342
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,180
Yes, I did have to pull Flatpak

343
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,620
from the squeeze back ports PPA.

344
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,460
But as soon as I did that, no problems whatsoever,

345
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,460
came right up.

346
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,660
What about installing a different kernel?

347
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,660
Did you go for that one?

348
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,120
I installed the Licorix kernel.

349
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,020
Oh, true.

350
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,820
Whoa.

351
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,860
Oh, no, guys.

352
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,400
Kernel 5.6, and that booted in 8.67.

353
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,840
OK, wow, OK.

354
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,140
So I think we'll hold the convince till the end,

355
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,080
which will be the extra, but you're doing really well there.

356
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,480
Bunsen Lab sounds like a serious contender.

357
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,120
What was the final disk size?

358
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,220
That's what I'm curious about.

359
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,420
Yeah, good question.

360
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,520
I went with 10 gig because Flatpak is a little heavier

361
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,560
as far as disk space.

362
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,160
And that was the only way I was able to really get

363
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,220
VS Code going.

364
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,620
OK, all right, fair enough.

365
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,160
All right, well, standby, Drew, I'll have a few more questions,

366
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,860
but we got to go to cheese now on Puppy

367
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,400
and see how Puppy stacks up and how many points.

368
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,800
Drew, do you have a rough back of the napkin calculation

369
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,540
so far of how many points you got there?

370
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,540
Oh, let's take a look here, 1, 2.

371
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:09,520
So let's see, I got 5 for that, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 45, so 47.

372
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,720
Ouch.

373
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,820
OK, so cheesy.

374
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,560
Let's see if we can beat 47.

375
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,800
How was Puppy Linux?

376
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,560
Puppy Linux is great.

377
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,560
It's real great.

378
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,400
Convince me now.

379
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,300
You're not really convincing me.

380
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,840
Yeah, I'm definitely not going to win

381
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,240
that portion of the 10 points.

382
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,200
So I did run it on a single core with a single gig of RAM,

383
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,940
as you would expect.

384
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,480
Normally, Puppy's meant to just boot and load into RAM.

385
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,060
I'm using boxes here for this, so I

386
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
ran into an issue with boxes where I could only

387
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,760
go down to 10 gigs in size.

388
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,720
Final install size, though, was 1.4 gigabyte.

389
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,620
I definitely hit all of those marks.

390
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,700
That's impressive.

391
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,400
I guess, except for the hard drive, it was 1.4 gigabyte.

392
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,640
I was able to run a browser, their Pale Moon browser,

393
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,900
and play an episode of Love.

394
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,740
There is an easy dark mode, kind of.

395
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,440
How do you figure?

396
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:08,980
What do you mean?

397
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,580
Yeah, let's get into that.

398
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,320
It's JWM, and there are different themes for JWM,

399
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,180
GTK2-based themes.

400
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,620
So I was able to install, out of the box, Nox, the Nox theme, which

401
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,400
is their version of a dark theme.

402
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,000
While maybe not extremely pretty, it is a dark mode.

403
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,740
So I was able to get a dark mode out of the box.

404
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,340
Easy to install the disk is kind of, I mean, it is.

405
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,940
It's stupid simple to install to disk, but.

406
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,880
You sound a little, I don't know, not confident.

407
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,020
Well, the way the Puppy is kind of set up, right,

408
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,240
is that it's the root user.

409
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,420
Like, everything defaults as root.

410
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,420
Now, you can go through settings to kind of adjust that to,

411
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,420
I think there's three different levels, FIDO being basically

412
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,600
a guest user type of thing.

413
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,060
So it's really a different kind of Linux.

414
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,400
It's not really your typical install.

415
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,800
The prompts are ridiculous.

416
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,200
You're not convincing me at all.

417
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,580
You know, I'm putting it all out there on the table, right?

418
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,180
It's one of those things where there's just a ton of these

419
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,680
prompts that are just lengthy and don't make a ton of sense.

420
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,380
There are three different networking applications

421
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,620
to choose from by default.

422
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,500
How do you want to connect to your network sort of thing?

423
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,900
Like, if this one doesn't work, try this one.

424
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,800
If that one doesn't work, try this one.

425
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,060
If you need a NDIS wrapper or something, try this one.

426
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,340
So it's kind of silly, right?

427
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,640
But you see, this is where you have an advantage.

428
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,780
Because for this, we're scoring it by the rules of the game.

429
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,840
So if you got this thing to play YouTube or any video game at all,

430
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,940
you're getting five points for either one of those things.

431
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,220
I think maybe at the end, we should consider too, like,

432
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,460
which one has the least space, since it sounds like we're all

433
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,760
kind of going over a little bit.

434
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,560
And I would mention too, BiteBitten points out

435
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,620
in the Mumble Room that this is available for some other

436
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,100
platforms where the minimal size really matters.

437
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,260
Right, like the Pi.

438
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,460
If you wanted to run it on the Pi, it'd be great for that.

439
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,660
I don't like running stuff as root,

440
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,940
so it's kind of weird for me, but yeah.

441
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,080
So what about things like VS Code or getting a different kernel

442
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,280
on there, how did that go?

443
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,740
So I kind of combined this two in one.

444
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,920
I installed software, which wasn't in the repos.

445
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,620
I installed VS Code or VS Codeium via an app image.

446
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,020
All right, OK, OK, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

447
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,500
We got to have a quorum on this.

448
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,660
See, I was thinking specifically it needs to be VS Code, not VS Codeium,

449
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,860
because VS Codeium is easier.

450
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,140
And I was thinking VS Code makes it actually a little harder

451
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,900
because it's the quote unquote, you know, official version,

452
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,540
which is slightly hard to get your hands on.

453
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,640
But I'm open to what Drew and Wes think on this issue.

454
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,740
Half credit.

455
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,880
All right, I'll agree with that.

456
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,580
Cheese, are you OK with that compromise?

457
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,480
Yes.

458
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,780
All right, all right.

459
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,780
Because there is that element of like, you have to use proprietary X,

460
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,580
can't you?

461
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,280
Yes, that's what that was going for there.

462
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,420
OK, OK.

463
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,660
Because obviously in this situation,

464
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,860
you would just use VS Codeium.

465
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,020
I agree, that's the right way to go.

466
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,320
But OK, we'll do five points.

467
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,120
Continue on.

468
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,020
I'm sorry, I just wanted to clarify that.

469
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,000
I was able to install that app image.

470
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:20,340
It doesn't have a modern GTK theme, so no five there.

471
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,240
I was able to play YouTube, so a five point there.

472
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,240
OK, good.

473
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,540
It booted in 12 seconds consistently.

474
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Oh.

475
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,280
So not bad.

476
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,380
As far as any video game, they have a section in Puppy called Fun.

477
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,380
And I was able to play a Sudoku clone.

478
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,520
Did you have fun?

479
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,320
Yes.

480
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,120
Good.

481
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,320
I am glad you had fun.

482
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

483
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,260
Have you tallied up your score yet?

484
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,060
Not quite.

485
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,140
I was not able to install a different kernel

486
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,640
by the default install, to be honest.

487
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,540
I just didn't go down that route.

488
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,740
You can easily switch kernels if you're

489
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,980
booting it off of a flash drive or something like that.

490
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,420
You're not actually installing it to disk.

491
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,980
So yeah, not really on that.

492
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,720
But if I tallied it up, that would be, what is it?

493
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:22,200
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

494
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,000
So I'm looking at 30 points.

495
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,400
All right, 30 points.

496
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,800
All right, 30 points for cheese.

497
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,800
I'm going to write that down.

498
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,040
That's not bad cheese, especially

499
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,880
because Puppy Linux is a longtime contender.

500
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,280
All right, Mr. Payne, we move on to you.

501
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,240
And let's start with your free BSD.

502
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,880
What do you say, let's try to score free BSD

503
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,280
against the board, and then you just

504
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,880
tell us a little bit about your side fling there.

505
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,220
Yeah, all right.

506
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,620
Because I really, that's kind of what I'm most interested in.

507
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,420
But I am interested also in how free BSD is stacked up.

508
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,460
What was the experience?

509
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,600
You know, honestly, nice.

510
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,800
I always enjoy free BSD, but it had been a little bit

511
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,400
since I really tried to shape it into something.

512
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,460
And I thought, how lean is it?

513
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,240
I mean, I've always found it to be just well organized,

514
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,980
not necessarily aimed towards being lean.

515
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,400
But why not give it a shot?

516
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,580
It has some good, I mean, some very good base requirements,

517
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,180
minimum hardware requirements, 96 megs of RAM.

518
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,620
So that was a no brainer at passing a whole gig of RAM.

519
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,520
Yeah, there's a point.

520
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,220
I think when I just installed base, it was under a gig.

521
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,260
But with like everything necessary, it was about 2.5.

522
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,060
That was to get XFCE on the desktop.

523
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,400
Fair enough.

524
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,600
I think we all went over the one gig disk limit.

525
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,060
When we were sitting around dreaming up these requirements,

526
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:36,800
I think maybe we were being a little over nostalgic.

527
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,200
It's interesting to see.

528
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,180
And I mean, Colibri definitely gets there.

529
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,740
But you're right, at some point, the applications

530
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,480
that we want to use these days, regardless of even just the OS

531
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,580
part of it, there's a lot of dependencies

532
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,420
because we have a lot of expectations

533
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,760
about richly featured software.

534
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,380
You know, it's just funny because I don't know,

535
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,660
does anybody remember making like special DOS

536
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,600
or even Mac boot disk to play video games

537
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,960
where you'd have just a minimal OS and the game

538
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,160
all on one disk?

539
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,060
Oh, absolutely.

540
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,860
Yep.

541
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,700
What a time.

542
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,900
A simpler time.

543
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,840
FreeBSD Handbook is, of course, excellent.

544
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,600
So, you know, walked me basically through like,

545
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,140
all right, how do I get X up and going?

546
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,680
How do I install XFCE?

547
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,580
And then from there, I had it on Firefox.

548
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,340
So listening back to an episode of Linux Unplugged,

549
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,840
that was also pretty easy to do.

550
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,680
You really took the build it up from the ground approach.

551
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,380
And that means things like dark mode and whatnot

552
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,320
are themes that you just install from the package manager

553
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,620
or whatever.

554
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,660
And so in a way, it's sort of easy to get these points

555
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,520
because you built the system towards it.

556
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,460
However, I don't, and I'm totally open to Drew

557
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,460
and Cheez's interpretation to this.

558
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,200
I think it still qualifies because our listeners

559
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,940
could do that if they were so interested.

560
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,300
And it was all very, you know, I mean, the installer

561
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,880
was very helpful to get me started with what did I

562
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,040
want to get set up with.

563
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,840
And then the Handbook gave you lots of options.

564
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,280
It didn't say you had to, but you know,

565
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,540
just like if you want to go down the route

566
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,480
to a graphical interface, here you go.

567
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,720
So the initial install, it's all still in Curses?

568
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,020
Yeah. Wow.

569
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,280
But it's very efficient. You know, it was a pleasant experience.

570
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,780
Yeah. No, it is. All right.

571
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,460
So I think you're probably going to qualify for the one points

572
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,520
except for the one gigabyte hard drive.

573
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,660
But I don't think any of us are getting that.

574
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,500
So you might take that off your list if you have it.

575
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,440
But would you classify that as a pretty easy to install OS

576
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,800
if you were just generally fairly comfortable

577
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,340
using computers and whatnot?

578
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,040
Yeah, I think so. You know what it also had

579
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,340
that most operating systems don't.

580
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,240
Just an easy automatic ZFS installer option.

581
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,240
Oh, really?

582
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,980
So I went with UFS for this little test,

583
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,180
but I mean, it works really nicely.

584
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,860
Okay. I was going to say, I think our buddy Allen Jude

585
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,860
had a hand in that.

586
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,860
Right.

587
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Okay. So let's get to the five point bonus round,

588
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,260
which is modern GTK theme, installing something

589
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,660
that's not in the repos,

590
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,260
which I'm really interested in that one.

591
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,240
And then obviously playing YouTube or Netflix,

592
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,800
booting to the desktop in 20 seconds

593
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,600
or any video game at all.

594
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,380
Did you have challenges with any of those?

595
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,880
Okay, so GTK theme, that was fine.

596
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,680
The Arc theme is in the ports tree,

597
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,840
so that was easy to get, which the ports tree is awesome.

598
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,620
Maybe second only to the AUR.

599
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,580
You know, honestly, configuring FreeBSD up

600
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,820
and getting it all running,

601
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,620
it does, Arch and FreeBSD seem like they are sort of

602
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,620
two sides of the same coin in some respects.

603
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,620
Obviously, there's a ton of philosophical differences

604
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,800
between them, but just from my end user experience of them,

605
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,800
and I like both of them.

606
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,100
I absolutely have felt that way too.

607
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,840
I am interested that you have had that same observation.

608
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,440
I think what happened is FreeBSD users just said,

609
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,840
you know what, I'm gonna go do this on Linux.

610
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,440
Right, exactly.

611
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,740
I really liked what I had, but I want this random piece

612
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,520
of hardware that Linux has support for to work,

613
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,680
so I guess I'll use their bastard kernel.

614
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,780
Okay, so what went less well?

615
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,760
I did get YouTube to work in Firefox, no Netflix.

616
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's okay.

617
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,520
If you get one of them, you still get the point.

618
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,900
Oh, okay, really?

619
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,360
Yeah, I'm not gonna let DRM hold us back.

620
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,400
I like it.

621
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,140
I feel like, you know, and Firefox is doing

622
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,140
a lot of the heavy lifting there, I suppose.

623
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,900
Feel free to push back, but I mean,

624
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,940
I think to make that work, we should have made Netflix

625
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,240
its own point item.

626
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,780
That's right, there's a slash in there.

627
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,620
Yeah, all right, how about that desktop boot time?

628
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,120
Just under the wire at 18 seconds.

629
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,580
Ha, spoiler alert, that's what mine was too.

630
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,020
Okay, what about any video game at all?

631
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,820
Super Tux Cart was in the ports tree,

632
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,120
so I gave that an install.

633
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,720
Classic.

634
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Okay, now we get to the ten points.

635
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,060
Can you get VS Code going on FreeBSD?

636
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,660
VS Codium, yes, that is, I believe that's what's

637
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,960
in the ports tree, that's what I gave it an install,

638
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,300
that seemed to work.

639
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,600
I didn't edit anything really in it,

640
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,340
but it's the open source version.

641
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,140
So five points, I think, to you for that.

642
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,240
So adjust your accounting.

643
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,380
Oh, I did install some software, not in the repos,

644
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
because I didn't even check, I don't know why,

645
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,880
but I just downloaded RIPGrip, that handy,

646
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,580
super fast, Rust-implemented grip alternative

647
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,980
and so it gave the Rust stuff an install on FreeBSD

648
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,080
so I could compile it.

649
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,520
Huh, okay, that counts.

650
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,200
Does the kernel, so we have, this is a tough one.

651
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,400
I was gonna, yeah.

652
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,100
For ten points, we have install a different kernel,

653
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,400
but you kinda could choose your own kernel in a way, right?

654
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,400
I mean, I'm not super familiar with the way FreeBSD works,

655
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,400
but I assume you had some governance.

656
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,480
Well, and I mean, should I at least get half points

657
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,940
just because I'm using a non-Linux kernel for this one?

658
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,540
Yeah, I think maybe you could get five.

659
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,480
You guys okay with that, what do you think?

660
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,580
Yeah, sure.

661
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,980
Giving him points now, come on.

662
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,380
Well, no, I mean, we don't have to, but it seems like.

663
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,820
He's bringing BSD to a Linux challenge.

664
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,320
I mean, we could not.

665
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,300
I think Cheese is just butt-hurt because he scored so low.

666
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,260
Hey, don't you be hatin' on the woof-woof.

667
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,200
Hey, you brought the jalopy, bro, I'm sorry.

668
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,780
Okay, so, Wes, you're looking pretty good there.

669
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,340
Do you have a grand total for FreeBSD on our Linux podcast?

670
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,080
Oh, no, what have we done?

671
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,080
Forty.

672
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,280
Well, he beat Puppy.

673
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,420
That wasn't surprising that that was gonna happen.

674
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,820
So far, though, we got Drew in the lead at 47.

675
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,360
Yeah, well, we'll see.

676
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,960
I'm hoping to convince you all.

677
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,400
I didn't even bother doing the kernel

678
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,200
because I think I'm gonna win the Convince Your Co-Host round here

679
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,940
because Sparky Linux was something special that I came across.

680
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,040
I wasn't expecting to fall in love,

681
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,440
but I definitely have.

682
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,180
It's a Linux distribution that's on top of Debian.

683
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,040
And boy, do I now appreciate what that means.

684
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,980
When you're looking for a minimal Linux distro,

685
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,920
having a Debian base means you have access to everything.

686
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,720
And Sparky is a fast, lightweight, fully customizable OS

687
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,300
that has a couple of different versions

688
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
that I'll get into here in a moment.

689
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,100
But something else that I think,

690
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,740
as somebody who has used a distribution on and off

691
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,200
a couple of times, as a guy who has used Linux

692
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,140
every now and then for a couple of years,

693
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,740
one of the things I have learned is a active community

694
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,740
makes the difference between a living distribution

695
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,220
and a dead one.

696
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,680
Sparky Linux has a very healthy Linux community around it

697
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:04,860
and also very active developers who are laying out

698
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,520
near-term and long-term roadmaps.

699
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,260
This month, I mean, it's not a huge goal,

700
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,160
but this month, they are 210% funded by their community.

701
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,960
That's great. Wow.

702
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,440
This is something special here.

703
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,700
Sparky Linux is something really special.

704
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,000
And I think it's targeted at those of us

705
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,480
who have been around for a little while,

706
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,080
tried a couple of desktops, and we know what we like.

707
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,680
The main features of Sparky, obviously, is that it's Debian.

708
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,380
But it has two branches, stable and semi-rolling,

709
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,860
which is awesome.

710
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,860
And of course, I obviously went with semi-rolling.

711
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,460
Lightweight, fast, simple.

712
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,460
It has lots of desktops to choose from,

713
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,860
and it has a command line edition that has no X,

714
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,860
where you can just build up from the ground up.

715
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,260
Oh, fancy that.

716
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,940
Mm-hmm. This is the FreeBSD guy.

717
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,180
And I really like their three special editions

718
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,880
that they focus on.

719
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,880
So they have a Game Over edition, which is great.

720
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,680
I'll talk more about that in a minute.

721
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,120
They have a multimedia edition for audio and video.

722
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,920
They have a rescue edition for going in

723
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,320
and fixing broken Linux systems.

724
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,720
Oh, I called right out. That's handy.

725
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,820
Yeah. And a minimal command line edition,

726
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,420
which is really nice.

727
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,260
But I chose to go with the rolling LX cute version

728
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,060
of their distribution.

729
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,900
They also offer XFCE and MATE.

730
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,740
But I went LX cute.

731
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,440
And they also have a, I should add,

732
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,140
a minimal GUI version, which is Openbox.

733
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,140
Oh, nice.

734
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,480
Which I also checked out,

735
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,620
because I was really enjoying this distribution.

736
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,680
So I just kind of, I ate it all up.

737
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,320
I just tried out all the different spins

738
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,320
because it was so great.

739
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,520
But for my main testing, I focused on the LX cute version.

740
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,060
Now let's go down the points, because I got an issue

741
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,820
with the starting line, and I got to ask you guys about this.

742
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,660
So it technically fits within a system

743
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,900
within one gigabyte of RAM.

744
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,740
Okay.

745
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,800
With a major caveat.

746
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,440
How much swap are we talking?

747
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,280
Actually, by default, it does not have the swap enabled.

748
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,240
And when you only have one gig of RAM on a system

749
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,780
with no swap, let me tell you

750
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,780
about the careful dance you learned to take.

751
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,480
Yeah, I mean, I turned swap off on the systems I installed.

752
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,020
Yeah, I did not have swap, and it was something.

753
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,220
Firefox was really great until it wasn't, let me tell you.

754
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,960
I think you just got it treated as a single tab browser.

755
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,720
Yes, very much.

756
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,660
So the installer, I think it's a bug,

757
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,000
and that's why I think maybe we should allow this.

758
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,800
So it technically runs on systems

759
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,500
with one gigabyte of free RAM.

760
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
But when you boot a live environment...

761
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,840
Well, that takes some RAM.

762
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,140
And then you technically do not have a gigabyte of free RAM.

763
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,420
The installer does a check, is one gigabyte free, yes or no?

764
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,620
And when it's no, it puts up an error message

765
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,120
and does not allow you to continue.

766
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,120
However, if you go with the minimal GUI

767
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,120
or the minimal CLI version, and you do it on the same box,

768
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,960
and it doesn't do that check, or it does the check

769
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,920
and you're using so little RAM, it's okay, it continues.

770
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,000
And then you can use the system just fine.

771
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,360
Right, so if you, right, you can even boost the RAM,

772
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,740
install, and then shrink it down.

773
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,840
And it would work fine, I did exactly that test

774
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,440
for the gaming edition.

775
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,440
Yeah, I think you should get that point then.

776
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,340
So what did it idle around on RAM usage?

777
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,440
So good question, I did take a note of that.

778
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,040
Let me pull up my notes here, cheese.

779
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,940
You know, honestly, that just feels like experiences

780
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,780
I've had installing operating systems on Mac hardware

781
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,580
after they said, no, they won't support this.

782
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,860
But if you edit that P list...

783
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,260
Yes, yeah.

784
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,760
I don't know, I kind of take issue with this.

785
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,900
Okay.

786
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,500
If there's a bug in the installer

787
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,760
that causes you not to be able to install on one gig of RAM,

788
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,100
that is problematic.

789
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,780
However, there is a case to be said for the fact

790
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,540
that you were able to do it on another edition.

791
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,080
So I don't know, I could go either way.

792
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,740
That does seem like a savior right there.

793
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,880
Yeah, it's sort of a tricky one

794
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,580
because you could just do the CLI

795
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,980
and then apt-get install the desktop and you'd be fine.

796
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,620
Sounds like a half point to me.

797
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,360
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, half point.

798
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,460
But then I'm in like a 0.5 situation

799
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,860
because this is only a one pointer.

800
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,860
Yeah, half point, round up to one, give it to you.

801
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
All right, all right, okay.

802
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,460
So half a point, I'll take half a point

803
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,460
if you guys are okay with that.

804
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,100
I think that's fair because there is that issue.

805
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,700
So you'd have to, yeah, all right, I think it's fair.

806
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,140
So yeah, so cheese, you asked what was the base run rate?

807
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,740
Just with the LXQt version, which I checked the most,

808
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,720
with it just running and everything kind of like sitting

809
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,320
there for 10 minutes, I was using 398 megabytes of RAM.

810
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,320
Okay.

811
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,620
Not bad.

812
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,220
So I mean, you're still within that threshold of one gig,

813
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,060
right?

814
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,260
Here's what surprised me.

815
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,620
I mean, this is kind of horrible,

816
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,620
but also is not the end of the world.

817
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,960
I, spoiler alert, was able to install third party apps

818
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,100
because it's Debian-based.

819
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,800
Chrome, watching the SpaceX live stream,

820
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,340
750 megabytes of RAM usage, not horrible.

821
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,240
I mean, really close to my limit, right?

822
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,420
So I was able to launch a terminal and do htop.

823
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,680
So that was in that mix, but I don't have much room

824
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,060
for anything else, like another Chrome tab.

825
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,560
What was interesting about this is

826
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,100
Firefox ran really, really well in this one core

827
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,700
limited memory environment until it didn't.

828
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,260
And then it just drug my whole system down,

829
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,440
where Chrome was just consistently slow.

830
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,340
Interesting.

831
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,000
Yeah, I just thought that was one thing.

832
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,340
But just an aside here, guys, as somebody

833
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,340
who has been around and using the Linux desktop

834
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,540
since single core computers were a common thing,

835
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:36,420
holy crap is single core Linux painfully slow.

836
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,220
I did not fully appreciate or understand

837
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,360
how much my Linux desktop has taken advantage

838
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,700
of multi-core progress because it just

839
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,920
was like the boiling frog thing.

840
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,560
It just sort of happened slowly as the technology built out.

841
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,000
So did the desktop, and the developers

842
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,060
took advantage of it.

843
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,080
I know it sounds silly to say this, but back in my day,

844
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,080
there was a real push to try to convince developers

845
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,440
that multi-core development was worth their time.

846
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,220
I even attended an Intel event where

847
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,220
they tried to make a pitch to open source developers

848
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,020
that it was worth their effort to support multi-core

849
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,180
processors.

850
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,020
And they said that the days of CPU megahertz increasing

851
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,920
year after year were over.

852
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,820
This is an Intel event.

853
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,800
They fed us, they brought us in, they put up this video,

854
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,260
the whole thing about Moore's law and all that,

855
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,600
and they showed like a progression of the Pentium line

856
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,900
from the 286 to the 386 to the 486 to the Pentium

857
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,880
to the Pentium 2 to the Pentium 3 to the Pentium 4

858
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,340
and just this increase, increase, increase of megahertz

859
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,420
that was so impressive.

860
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,520
And you have to understand that for a period of time,

861
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,780
it was just assumed that this was just the law of computing,

862
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,480
that this megahertz increase was just

863
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,560
going to continue at infinitum until we were piling starships.

864
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,500
And Intel sat us all down and said, no, no, no, no.

865
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,700
We're kind of done with that.

866
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,840
The megahertz race is over.

867
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,200
We're going to have some gradual increments,

868
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,700
but what it's all about now is cores.

869
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,680
We're going to have multiple cores.

870
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,080
This is before they did like the core series and all of that.

871
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,740
There was a line of Intel processors

872
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,480
that I actually have in the machine here that

873
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,880
was before the core series, but still multi-core.

874
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,280
And it was right around this time.

875
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,520
And they were trying to make the case to developers

876
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,520
to go with multi-processing and multi-core development.

877
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:26,320
Yeah, right.

878
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,320
I mean, it is extra work.

879
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,560
You've got to sell them.

880
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,100
If you want to take advantage of the hardware that's

881
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,000
going to be out there in your customer's hands,

882
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,140
this is what you have to do.

883
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,800
Yeah, and so now from an end user's perspective,

884
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,340
I just didn't really appreciate how well the Linux desktop had

885
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,780
adapted to the multi-core CPU world

886
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,440
because it just sort of happened organically over time.

887
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,780
But by doing this challenge and going back in time

888
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,120
and limiting myself to one gigabyte of RAM

889
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,680
and one CPU core, even if it was like a 2.3 gigahertz CPU

890
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,260
core or whatever, is painfully slow.

891
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,220
It's striking how better it is now.

892
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,420
We really have it good.

893
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,120
Well, and I wonder how much of that

894
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:07,760
is due to you using LXQt because I did not have the same

895
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,900
experience under Openbox.

896
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Everything was snappy and fast for me,

897
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,240
even with one core and one gig of RAM.

898
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,540
I wouldn't say that the desktop was necessarily slow.

899
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,080
It was just if I was installing software

900
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,580
and I was trying to watch the SpaceX video stream,

901
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,380
I definitely was waiting on stuff.

902
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,720
Like, I would click on a new tab,

903
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,220
and it would be a few beats before.

904
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,220
I mean, I was definitely I felt like I was pushing it.

905
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,100
There's also a question of what your backing store was.

906
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,300
I was running on an NVMe.

907
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,260
It's a WD Blue NVMe M.2 drive.

908
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,600
And that could play a big part of it too.

909
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,340
Also, I did have swap.

910
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,840
So yeah, I don't know.

911
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,040
Cheater.

912
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,780
I honestly, I felt like the one thing

913
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,320
that Sparky Linux was missing for me

914
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,520
after all the spins that they have

915
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,780
was this would be so perfect on the Raspberry Pi.

916
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,620
It would have been like the ideal desktop environment.

917
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,260
Because everything else in this list I had,

918
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,120
I had easy access to dark mode.

919
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:13,760
They just have it right there built in.

920
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,300
That was absolutely no problem.

921
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,560
VS Code, Chrome, fine.

922
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,200
That all worked.

923
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,240
Easy installation.

924
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,140
Yeah, the installer, the GUI installer,

925
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,000
it felt like maybe I'd done it 1,000 times.

926
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,740
It's obviously some installer I've used before.

927
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,280
I just don't know what it's called.

928
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,840
All that worked fine.

929
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,240
I played Extreme Tax Cart Racer flawlessly.

930
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,320
It worked just great.

931
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,320
And if you use their game mode, which

932
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,980
is really cool, it comes loaded with games,

933
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,220
but it also has Steam installed.

934
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,820
It has Steam installed?

935
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,860
Yeah, or it's that, you know, I actually didn't run it.

936
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,000
I just saw it on the menu.

937
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,860
So it's possible it is that script that just downloads

938
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,900
Steam and runs it.

939
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,240
But it's right there in the menu, already set to go.

940
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,180
They call it the Game Over Edition.

941
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,580
And it loads XFCE.

942
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,840
And it's great.

943
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,120
It is really fun.

944
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:09,120
And the gaming on it is just basically one click

945
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,080
to get things started.

946
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,420
I was really impressed with Sparky.

947
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,660
Their Openbox edition, also really well done.

948
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,400
But I think, ultimately, what I really liked about it

949
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,600
was the way the developers were communicating

950
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,000
with the community.

951
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,300
They have forum posts, which are, I mean,

952
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,500
they're even active today.

953
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,040
I checked it before the show, and there's

954
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,400
topics that are going today.

955
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,040
But they have forum posts about their next milestones

956
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,480
for the distribution and where they see it going.

957
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,120
They're very transparent about the development.

958
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,120
That's really neat.

959
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,440
They're basing it on Debian, which

960
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,960
means you have access to any deb file, so Chrome or VS code.

961
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,860
We're just a deb download away.

962
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,760
A bunch of really smart defaults, so things

963
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,820
that I like to use out of the box, like gdebi,

964
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,120
were already installed and ready to go.

965
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,260
It was simple to install Chrome.

966
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,260
The base installation is tiny.

967
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,840
It's not one gig, but it's just around just a little bit

968
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,040
over two gigs.

969
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,540
Yeah, OK.

970
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,740
And I like that it's a modern Debian, too.

971
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,640
Their, quote unquote, rolling is essentially Debian testing

972
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,280
or whatever.

973
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,320
Or SID, is that what it's called in Debian?

974
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,460
And because I'm old, I don't remember anymore.

975
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,060
It's called Bullseye.

976
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,160
And I think it's totally usable as a desktop.

977
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,560
Everything was simple.

978
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,760
Everything worked.

979
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,160
And the community had a lot of interesting discussions

980
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,160
going on about future directions.

981
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,000
And I felt like, at the end of it,

982
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,200
this is a distribution.

983
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,000
And I don't often say this.

984
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,400
This is something I'm going to keep using.

985
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,040
This is now my go-to clean Debian environment in a VM.

986
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,840
That does sound very minimal and just.

987
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,280
And because they're semi-rolling,

988
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,880
it's an apt update, apt get update, whatever.

989
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,320
Follow along with Debian.

990
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,780
And I'm essentially current.

991
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,320
And because it's so minimal, there's

992
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,680
not a lot that's going to break.

993
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,660
So I can leave this in a VM, park it for months at a time,

994
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,500
fire it back up, do an update upgrade, and I'm good to go.

995
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,900
Really, the only thing I didn't do

996
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,560
was bother installing a different kernel

997
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,860
because everything was working really great.

998
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,600
I think, really, when you look at it,

999
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,300
Sparky Linux is that thing we didn't really

1000
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,580
know was possible anymore, is a new community based

1001
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,420
around a Debian distro cropping up that really actually kind

1002
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,980
of fills a few niches and isn't just barking into the wind.

1003
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,020
A community has actually shown up

1004
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,760
and is funding this thing at the tune that is,

1005
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,300
I'm very happy to say, 210% of the monthly goal, right?

1006
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,460
Like, there's a real response here.

1007
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,640
Barking into the wind, was that a stab at puppy?

1008
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,200
Also, what kind of boot time did you get?

1009
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,600
18 seconds.

1010
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,640
I got 18 seconds on that there boot time, which just barely

1011
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,840
under it.

1012
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,080
And I felt like maybe could have been a little better.

1013
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,440
I tell you, there's that.

1014
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,820
I felt like the boot time could have been slightly faster,

1015
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,180
although I'll take it.

1016
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,520
I would have loved to have seen the Arc theme installed

1017
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,420
by default, obviously, in the repo.

1018
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,020
Why not have it by default?

1019
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,920
And boy, howdy, would I love an ARM version.

1020
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,960
This would be such a solid candidate for a Pi 4 desktop.

1021
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,040
Well, you know, Chris, I just looked,

1022
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,200
and there actually is on, if you go to sparkylinux.org

1023
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,340
slash tag slash Raspberry Pi, they actually

1024
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,640
do have builds ready to go.

1025
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:29,720
I think Chris should be minus points for not finding that.

1026
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,180
I mean, I don't want to speak here for all of you,

1027
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,860
but clearly this is a contender now

1028
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,060
because the active community, the Debian rolling base,

1029
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,800
or stable, whichever you prefer, the several editions

1030
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,660
that scratch different itches, and an ARM edition.

1031
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,400
How are you going to beat this in a lightweight distro, guys?

1032
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,640
How are you going to beat that?

1033
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,040
So I mean, that's why I'm going for that additional 10 points

1034
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,480
of convincing your co-hosts.

1035
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,380
I didn't even bother with the kernel

1036
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,640
because I think if you just look at the facts here,

1037
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,720
you add it all up, I have 39.5 points base.

1038
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,880
But if you add that 10 point convince a co-host,

1039
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,920
if any one of you agree with me that this is a solid

1040
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,360
lightweight distro with a great community available

1041
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,200
for multiple platforms and different types of uses,

1042
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,460
then I get 10 additional points.

1043
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,960
And that puts me at 49.5, which is ahead of Drew at 47.

1044
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,340
I'm just putting that out there.

1045
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,080
I think that your whole display there

1046
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,080
was the convincing the co-host.

1047
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,140
I think you started with convincing your co-hosts,

1048
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,120
and then you went into the specs.

1049
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:37,480
And let's not forget that Chris added the convincing

1050
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:44,460
the co-host 10 point round today, today, hours ago.

1051
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,800
Moments before the show.

1052
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,900
Yes, that's true.

1053
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,500
However, he looked at it.

1054
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,000
He saw what I was posting in Slack and said,

1055
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,140
oh my god, I'm going to lose this thing.

1056
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,140
I need something.

1057
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,940
Yep.

1058
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,700
No, I just feel like, I just thought, you know what?

1059
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,080
At the end of the day, you got to have

1060
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,380
an inclusive understanding of a distribution.

1061
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,780
It can't just be a by the numbers thing.

1062
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,580
It's got to be about the community too.

1063
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,340
And we needed a way to factor that.

1064
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,880
And I thought if one of us could truly advocate because we

1065
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,980
love something, we fell in love with it,

1066
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,360
that should be worth something.

1067
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,260
Well, let me just tell you, Calibri OS,

1068
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,460
I added up the points for it.

1069
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,260
Oh, shoot.

1070
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,300
And it got 19.

1071
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,800
Hold on, hold on, I forgot all about that.

1072
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,500
If three of us vote that it's our favorite.

1073
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,440
I got so obsessed with Winnie, and I completely

1074
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,440
forgot to talk about that.

1075
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,100
So give us your thoughts on Calibri OS.

1076
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,740
Well, it's a small open source x86 only,

1077
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,740
so I'm losing out there.

1078
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,140
But hey, FreeBSD runs on all kinds of stuff.

1079
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,540
It's forked off a Menuet OS, if you remember that.

1080
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,580
And it's just coded completely in assembly.

1081
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,020
And all right, if you thought what you were using

1082
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,320
was a throwback, this thing is amazing.

1083
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,520
Not only does it have primo floppy support,

1084
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:49,520
it's got read-only NTFS, it can do ext2, 3, and 4.

1085
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,760
But it comes with a whole bunch of games,

1086
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,760
including Doom, let me just say.

1087
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,560
And a ton of just handy from all this compile chain,

1088
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,900
a lot of nice tools for doing development in assembly.

1089
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,140
And then an IRC client that you can use to connect up to,

1090
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,980
some other chat stuff, its own web browser.

1091
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,140
Now, I wasn't able to play the MP3.

1092
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,980
It does include an audio player, and sound does work.

1093
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,820
But the web browser didn't want to.

1094
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,880
I tried to download it, but our MP3s are hosted on HTTPS,

1095
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,320
and I think that's what things went wrong.

1096
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,420
Are you serious?

1097
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,660
I didn't verify.

1098
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,700
It did load the page, so like linuxunplugged.com loaded,

1099
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,600
and it got to the download link,

1100
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,100
but I tried to use the built-in.

1101
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,660
Yeah, HTTPS is hard.

1102
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,000
I think if I had done it and pulled up a terminal,

1103
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,800
downloaded it that way, and I could have played it back

1104
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,800
on the operating system.

1105
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,240
Using like WGIT or something, curl or something.

1106
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:40,180
It does have a bunch of Unix built-ins,

1107
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,340
and it comes with a compiler tool chain,

1108
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,880
so you can install stuff from an outside operating system,

1109
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,920
and it boots wicked fast, so it should get extra points there.

1110
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,520
I love this, because this is one of those OSs

1111
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,020
that you didn't even know existed,

1112
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,920
and now you just want to go check it out.

1113
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,420
I just searched for this online,

1114
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,420
and one of the things that came up was,

1115
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,760
my mom tries it out.

1116
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,360
But Wikipedia says, Wes,

1117
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,060
that they haven't had a release for a year.

1118
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,200
For a year, but hey, we were talking about XFCE,

1119
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,700
so we all know that that's okay sometimes.

1120
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,340
Fair enough, fair enough, fair enough.

1121
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,700
You only need an i586 compatible CPU, so.

1122
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,940
All right, so I think what we have here

1123
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,540
is a bit of a standstill, and we need to bring in

1124
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,320
our virtual lug to help us sort this out a little bit.

1125
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,880
I know some of you have been listening along

1126
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,780
and have your own considerations.

1127
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,260
Jill, you've heard the arrangement.

1128
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,560
I know that you've been around.

1129
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,820
You've seen these distros.

1130
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,660
What do you think is the winner here?

1131
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,320
Who should get the Convince the Co-host 10 points?

1132
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,060
Definitely Sparky Linux. I love it too.

1133
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,060
And it's just so flexible.

1134
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,960
Hey, really?

1135
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,600
That was not planned. That was not planned.

1136
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,300
Okay, Jill, please go into detail.

1137
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,700
Checks in the mail, Jill.

1138
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,680
It's a beautiful-looking desktop and minimal,

1139
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,280
and you can run Steam games on it.

1140
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,180
So for me, that was, that's huge.

1141
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,820
And this is a really, really great challenge.

1142
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,960
There's another distro that's kind of similar to Sparky

1143
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,560
called AntiX, or Antics.

1144
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,100
Oh, yeah.

1145
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,460
Yeah, and so that one was based on originally MeePis

1146
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,060
with my group, the Linux Checks of Los Angeles.

1147
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,040
We used that to install on old Pentium II

1148
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:21,380
and Pentium III laptops that went to third world countries.

1149
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,780
Oh, that's great.

1150
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,680
And it's still running great on those machines,

1151
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,680
and they're still actively updating it.

1152
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,880
And it's a wonderful little Debian distro

1153
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,020
that does all the things.

1154
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,920
That is a bit of what we're talking about here.

1155
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,720
And we get so caught up in vulnerabilities

1156
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,960
about Intel CPUs and old machines

1157
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,460
that are just discarded now.

1158
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,260
But the reality is you can put a distribution

1159
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,860
on these things, and if it's the right one,

1160
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,940
that machine could run until the components fail,

1161
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,500
which is a surprisingly long time.

1162
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,080
At this rate, it seems to be long after the world ends.

1163
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,740
Yeah, definitely.

1164
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,780
And another suggestion I had,

1165
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,720
and it's one of my favorite distros of all time,

1166
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,880
is Tiny Core Linux, which was a spinoff

1167
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,680
of damn small Linux.

1168
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,660
And it actually runs on my thin clients,

1169
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,660
my four megabytes of RAM thin clients.

1170
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,860
Wow.

1171
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,460
And it'll run in a DOS loopback, on ARM,

1172
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,960
you know, on all the things.

1173
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,240
Holy smokes. Wow. Yeah.

1174
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:26,340
This wasn't an extensive list of tiny distributions

1175
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,440
or like lightweight, but that's what we got.

1176
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,080
And MiniMecha, I wanted to get your take

1177
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,440
on which distribution here should be assigned

1178
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,080
the Convince a Co-Host award.

1179
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,860
The thing is, it looks like the Debian-based systems

1180
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,860
seem to be the winner because they are really,

1181
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,860
really flexible, and you can basically do whatever you want.

1182
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,560
You can have a full-fledged system,

1183
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,260
you can strict them down to the basics,

1184
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:51,760
but you're really flexible with Flatpak,

1185
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,500
Steam, everything you want.

1186
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,700
I think that's the takeaway from this episode,

1187
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,000
is when you do a lightweight, if you can afford it,

1188
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,640
it does require a little bit more disk space,

1189
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,580
but go Debian-based if you can,

1190
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,180
because that just opens up so, so much more software.

1191
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,980
It comes down now, I think, in my estimation,

1192
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,220
to Bunsen Labs and Sparky, if we go by the points

1193
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,520
and nobody assigns the Convince a Co-Host,

1194
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:20,300
then I think Drew has it at 47, and I'm coming in at 39.5.

1195
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,000
Cheese, you got 30 points. Wes, you got 40.

1196
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,500
I'm quite compelled, especially by Jill's testimony here today,

1197
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,800
about Sparky Linux.

1198
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,000
I'll admit, as much as I really have had fun with FreeBSD.

1199
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,240
Okay, I like what you're saying.

1200
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,300
But I think you've had the pulpit for a while,

1201
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,040
and Drew should get to go to bat, maybe,

1202
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,780
for some of the community or other aspects around his show.

1203
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,080
Yeah, I would like to hear more about the community around Bunsen.

1204
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,580
That's actually the thing that's gonna make me say

1205
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,960
that my vote actually will go to Sparky.

1206
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,460
Oh, no way!

1207
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,560
What?

1208
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:49,760
How dare you?

1209
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,860
As much as I love Bunsen Labs

1210
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,060
and really enjoyed my time with Helium,

1211
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:00,260
the pitch that you gave for the community around Sparky Linux

1212
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,800
really makes me appreciate it.

1213
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,900
It's not a distro that I had really checked out.

1214
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,040
I'm not familiar with Sparky at all,

1215
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:13,620
but I am curious, especially if the community is that driven.

1216
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,320
Community is such an important part to me,

1217
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,660
especially after everything that I went through

1218
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,320
with all of the investigations that I did for Choose Linux.

1219
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,020
Community is huge.

1220
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,700
And if the Sparky community is that involved,

1221
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,640
then it deserves my attention,

1222
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,140
just hands down.

1223
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,940
Now, I will say that between the two,

1224
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,740
Bunsen Labs and Sparky,

1225
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,940
do seem like they're on a fairly even playing field.

1226
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,980
I think you would have clinched it

1227
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,820
without any of the co-host points

1228
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,420
if you had installed the kernel.

1229
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,420
Yeah.

1230
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,120
Because, running Debian,

1231
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,020
you could have gotten Liquorix installed in five minutes.

1232
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,020
You could have done it.

1233
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,520
No, you're right. I should have.

1234
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,520
I just, I thought going into it,

1235
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,860
I was so impressed by how, because, skeptical Chris,

1236
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,060
I went into it thinking, you know,

1237
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,140
this must be one of those ego projects

1238
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,840
where nobody's paying attention,

1239
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:10,540
and boy, did I have that opinion corrected.

1240
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,240
And so I was so, I was so impressed by that

1241
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,840
because you just don't see it anymore.

1242
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,180
And I really thought to myself,

1243
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,780
this seems like something that will stick around for a while.

1244
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,280
Okay, now with that all said,

1245
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,780
does anyone in the mumble room want to chime in for Puppy?

1246
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,780
Because I know we have some advocates in there.

1247
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,760
Maybe we could do some convincing.

1248
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,360
Cheese could use a solid 10 points

1249
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,600
because right now he's at the bottom at 30.

1250
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:33,000
That would bring him up at least two tie with Wes.

1251
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,660
That depends on what kernel does Sparky come with.

1252
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,160
Puppy comes with 4.7 out of the box

1253
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,300
on the Bionic Pup version.

1254
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,600
Four seven?

1255
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,800
You know what you can say about that.

1256
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,040
It's not three.

1257
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,840
Mm, I can't even get that to boot on my system, man.

1258
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:50,420
But, you know, I mean, something that we need to consider too,

1259
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,840
right, is portability.

1260
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:54,020
So if you wanted to just throw this on a flash drive

1261
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,580
and say you had an old netbook kicking around,

1262
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,260
it would be a great distro for that.

1263
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,460
Dude, it doesn't matter if you can't boot it.

1264
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:06,360
Okay, it's really coming down to it.

1265
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,160
So Drew has thrown in behind Sparky Linux.

1266
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,640
That adds 10 points to me.

1267
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:13,500
Here's our current point lineup.

1268
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,040
I'm in the lead at 49.5 points.

1269
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:21,780
Drew has 47 points, Cheese has 30, Wes has 40.

1270
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,020
Mr. Cheese Bacon, which distribution would you like

1271
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,720
to consolidate behind?

1272
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:31,120
I'm definitely gonna go with Bunsen.

1273
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,320
Oh!

1274
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,060
And a lot of the reason behind that

1275
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,760
is because I was a huge Crunch Bang fan

1276
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,160
and the community around Crunch Bang was awesome

1277
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,160
back in the day and evolved into Bunsen.

1278
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,100
And I'm a huge fan of Openbox because, look,

1279
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,100
you got Openbox.

1280
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,440
You are so fired, man.

1281
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,900
You are so fired.

1282
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,980
You got Openbox, you got Trayer, you got Tint2.

1283
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,920
Everything is configurable by just a comp file.

1284
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,520
So just restart X and you're back.

1285
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:05,420
It's super easy, super extensible, modifiable.

1286
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,420
But I think in the future that we need to add

1287
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,660
to this points list.

1288
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,600
We need to add community and we also need to add

1289
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,260
documentation because there's a lot to be said

1290
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,500
about both of those things and how well distros

1291
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,500
implement those.

1292
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,500
Very true.

1293
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,700
Okay, all right.

1294
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,940
I think that is completely fair for future versions

1295
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,240
if we do this again, if we do the great bake-off.

1296
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,580
I think we have to bring pies for the next bake-off also.

1297
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,580
Ooh, I like that.

1298
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,580
I'll just talk about it.

1299
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,980
All right, okay, I need to brace myself.

1300
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,120
Westpain, you currently sit at 40 points.

1301
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,120
You're not gonna beat this thing.

1302
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,220
So you gotta, I think, you just gotta throw in

1303
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,500
behind a distribution.

1304
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,200
Drew currently sits at 57 points in the lead.

1305
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,640
I'm coming in the rear at 49.5.

1306
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,800
I thought maybe you were making a good case for

1307
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:59,200
getting behind the old Sparky, but I gotta admit

1308
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,540
there's a good case for Bunsen too.

1309
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,540
Westpain, where are you throwing your host endorsement?

1310
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,580
Well, what I want to do is give it to CalibriOS

1311
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,480
to get it to 29 points, so it's a little more respectable.

1312
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,360
But, I mean, I think having listened to Jill

1313
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,820
and just a ton of stuff I see over there on the IRC,

1314
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,700
yeah, all right, I have to go with Sparky.

1315
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,700
Oh, my goodness, are you serious right now?

1316
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,700
Are you serious?

1317
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,940
Is that your final answer there, Westpain?

1318
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,240
That is my final support.

1319
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:34,240
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1320
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,580
That barely puts me in the lead at 59.5.

1321
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,880
I take the win there, just barely for Sparky Linux.

1322
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,080
Not for me, but for the developers of Sparky Linux

1323
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,920
who have worked so hard to make a great distribution

1324
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,760
with a strong community following.

1325
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,860
It is that community, not me, that put it over the edge here.

1326
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,000
And I also want to thank my mom and my kids.

1327
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,560
You know, I saw you booting it up a little, really.

1328
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,900
It's only because it had a nice looking boot animation.

1329
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,340
I saw that across the room and I was like,

1330
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,200
ah, that's going to have to be.

1331
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,680
And also, the dark mode is slick looking, isn't it?

1332
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:08,980
Isn't that nice?

1333
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,240
Yeah, they really nailed it.

1334
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,180
Now, the only thing that kept us from being a blowout

1335
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,180
was that you had a gambit to not do the alternate kernel

1336
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,460
and instead rely solely on your last minute

1337
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:26,060
addition of a points entry for convincing your co-host.

1338
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,760
You know, the thing is, I am a natural salesman,

1339
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,260
so I thought that could be a strength.

1340
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,240
But also, I knew you guys, because you all

1341
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:38,440
are long-term Linux users, you know that a strong community

1342
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,740
is vital to make a distribution successful.

1343
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,540
And I knew I'd get you on that point.

1344
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,380
Dammit.

1345
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,780
Ah.

1346
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,880
If I was a co-host, I would have actually thrown it

1347
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,620
towards Bunsen because it's actually

1348
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,020
outlasted a distribution now.

1349
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,860
That's fair.

1350
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,460
You know, longevity does count.

1351
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,220
And Cheese did, I think to Cheese's credit,

1352
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,360
he did throw in his 10 points.

1353
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,220
Drew, you really almost got it at 57.

1354
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:05,400
And I think with the takeaway there is Bunsen or Sparky

1355
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,700
is actually really great.

1356
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,700
They're both worth giving a try after you listen to this episode.

1357
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,340
And they both have great names.

1358
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,500
There's that.

1359
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,640
And the really thing to take away from it

1360
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,940
is that they're Debian-based.

1361
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,940
And that really seems to be the winning recipe.

1362
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,880
And what a rich ecosystem has spawned from Debian, you know?

1363
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:21,220
I mean, like, it itself is great,

1364
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,280
and then you've just got this whole world

1365
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:26,420
of other creative, interesting options that are useful.

1366
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,420
Well, let's begin to wrap it up right here.

1367
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,220
If you've got any show ideas or feedback or concerns,

1368
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,720
considerations, or anything else,

1369
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:36,400
go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1370
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,700
For links to the distributions we talked about and whatnot

1371
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,140
today, you can go to linuxunplugged.com slash 357.

1372
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,040
The show is at Linux Unplugged on Twitter.

1373
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,680
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1374
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,180
Mr. Payne, where can they find you?

1375
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,440
At Westpane.

1376
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,680
How about that? That's easy.

1377
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,580
Easy to remember.

1378
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,640
Drew, Cheese, where can they find you guys?

1379
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,580
I'm at DrewofDoom on Twitter, at Cheese Bacon.

1380
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:00,960
God, I can't believe that, Cheese Bacon.

1381
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,160
That's so good.

1382
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,660
You know what, you could build an empire around that name.

1383
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,260
All right, we are live on Tuesdays,

1384
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,700
except for when I'm on the road.

1385
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,360
That calendar is JupiterBroadcasting.com

1386
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,460
slash calendar.

1387
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,160
We appreciate you joining us live.

1388
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,940
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode

1389
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,160
of the Unplugged program.

1390
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,540
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1391
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:28,540
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1392
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,140
So this whole challenge was flawed

1393
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,740
because there was no Arch involved in this conversation.

1394
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,440
And there was no Fedora either.

1395
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,640
Yeah, Arch is the smallest.

1396
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:02,140
Well, you know, we just kind of, we had a list of distributions

1397
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,240
and we just tumbled them all up and assigned them.

1398
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,080
It wasn't like a comprehensive, but you're right.

1399
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:09,720
Something Arch-based would probably do very well.

1400
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,920
And I could see something Fedora-based.

1401
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,720
I don't think that is, I don't think that's a good idea.

1402
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:19,260
Something Fedora-based, I don't think that is so much

1403
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:22,260
as oversight as it is an opportunity for future content.

1404
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,260
More backups.

1405
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:46,260
Yep, yep.
